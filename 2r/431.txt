the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, was, a, european, great, power, conflict, fought, between, 1701, and, 1714, the, immediate, cause, was, the, death, of, the, childless, charles, ii, of, spain, in, november, 1700, which, led, to, a, struggle, for, control, of, the, spanish, empire, among, supporters, of, the, claimant, bourbon, and, habsburg, dynasties, his, official, heir, was, philip, of, anjou, a, grandson, of, louis, xiv, of, france, whose, main, backers, were, france, and, most, of, spain, his, rival, archduke, charles, of, austria, was, supported, by, the, grand, alliance, whose, primary, members, included, austria, the, dutch, republic, and, great, britain, significant, related, conflicts, include, the, 1700, to, 1721, great, northern, war, and, queen, anne, s, war, in, north, america, although, by, 1701, spain, was, no, longer, the, predominant, european, power, its, global, empire, still, included, the, spanish, netherlands, large, parts, of, italy, and, the, americas, its, acquisition, by, either, france, or, austria, threatened, the, european, balance, of, power, and, philip, s, proclamation, as, king, of, spain, on, 16, november, 1700, led, to, war, the, french, held, the, advantage, in, the, early, stages, but, were, forced, onto, the, defensive, after, 1706, although, the, allies, continued, to, advance, in, northern, france, by, 1709, philip, had, cemented, his, position, in, spain, the, ostensible, cause, of, the, war, when, emperor, joseph, i, died, in, 1711, archduke, charles, succeeded, his, brother, as, holy, roman, emperor, since, a, union, of, spain, and, austria, was, as, unwelcome, as, one, with, france, the, new, british, government, argued, it, was, pointless, to, continue, by, now, only, british, subsidies, kept, their, allies, in, the, war, and, their, withdrawal, led, to, the, peace, of, utrecht, in, 1713, followed, by, the, treaties, of, rastatt, and, baden, in, 1714, philip, was, confirmed, as, king, of, spain, but, renounced, his, claim, and, those, of, his, descendants, to, the, french, throne, the, spanish, empire, ceded, much, of, its, italian, territories, to, savoy, and, austria, along, with, the, spanish, netherlands, although, it, remained, largely, intact, outside, europe, britain, received, gibraltar, and, menorca, and, acquired, major, trade, concessions, in, the, spanish, americas, for, the, dutch, despite, attaining, their, long, sought, after, barrier, treaty, the, war, is, seen, as, marking, the, beginning, of, their, decline, as, a, significant, european, power, although, louis, succeeded, in, placing, his, grandson, on, the, spanish, throne, france, was, left, financially, exhausted, charles, ii, of, spain, succeeded, his, father, philip, iv, at, the, age, of, four, in, 1665, subject, to, extended, periods, of, ill, health, for, much, of, his, life, the, issue, of, his, successor, was, a, matter, of, diplomatic, debate, for, decades, for, example, in, 1670, charles, ii, of, england, agreed, to, support, the, rights, of, louis, xiv, of, france, while, the, 1689, grand, alliance, committed, england, and, the, dutch, republic, to, back, those, of, leopold, i, holy, roman, emperor, when, charles, died, in, 1700, the, spanish, empire, was, no, longer, the, dominant, great, power, but, still, included, much, of, italy, and, the, americas, the, spanish, netherlands, and, colonies, such, as, the, philippines, negotiations, between, louis, and, emperor, leopold, centred, on, dividing, these, territories, which, the, spanish, refused, to, allow, since, the, acquisition, of, an, undivided, empire, by, either, austria, or, france, would, make, them, too, powerful, its, inheritance, led, to, a, war, that, involved, most, of, europe, the, 1700, 1721, great, northern, war, is, considered, a, connected, conflict, since, it, affected, the, involvement, of, states, such, as, sweden, saxony, denmark, norway, and, russia, armies, in, the, 1688, to, 1697, nine, years, war, frequently, numbered, over, 100, 000, requiring, expenditure, unsustainable, for, pre, industrial, economies, the, 1690s, also, marked, the, low, point, of, the, little, ice, age, a, period, of, cold, and, wet, weather, that, drastically, reduced, crop, yields, across, europe, the, great, famine, of, 1695, 1697, killed, an, estimated, 15, 25, of, the, population, in, present, day, scotland, scandinavia, and, the, baltic, states, plus, another, two, million, in, france, and, northern, italy, this, combination, of, financial, exhaustion, and, famine, led, to, the, october, 1697, treaty, of, ryswick, a, compromise, that, left, the, succession, unresolved, since, it, now, seemed, clear, charles, would, die, without, children, leopold, signed, only, with, extreme, reluctance, and, all, sides, viewed, ryswick, as, only, a, temporary, suspension, of, hostilities, unlike, the, crowns, of, france, or, austria, that, of, spain, could, be, inherited, through, the, female, line, this, allowed, charles, sisters, maria, theresa, 1638, 1683, and, margaret, theresa, 1651, 1673, to, pass, their, rights, onto, the, children, of, their, respective, marriages, with, louis, xiv, and, emperor, leopold, louis, sought, to, avoid, conflict, over, the, issue, through, direct, negotiation, with, his, main, opponent, william, iii, of, england, while, excluding, the, spanish, leopold, and, margaret, s, daughter, maria, antonia, 1669, 1692, married, maximilian, ii, emanuel, elector, of, bavaria, in, 1685, and, on, 28, october, 1692, they, had, a, son, joseph, ferdinand, under, the, october, 1698, treaty, of, the, hague, between, france, britain, and, the, dutch, republic, five, year, old, joseph, was, designated, heir, to, charles, ii, in, return, france, and, austria, would, receive, parts, of, spain, s, european, territories, charles, refused, to, accept, this, on, 14, november, 1698, he, published, a, will, leaving, an, undivided, spanish, monarchy, to, joseph, ferdinand, however, the, latter, s, death, from, smallpox, in, february, 1699, undid, these, arrangements, in, 1685, maria, antonia, passed, her, claim, to, the, spanish, throne, onto, leopold, s, sons, joseph, and, archduke, charles, her, right, to, do, so, was, doubtful, but, louis, and, william, used, this, to, devise, the, 1700, treaty, of, london, archduke, charles, became, the, new, heir, while, france, savoy, and, austria, received, territorial, compensation, however, since, neither, leopold, nor, charles, agreed, the, treaty, was, largely, pointless, by, early, october, 1700, charles, was, dying, his, final, will, left, the, throne, to, louis, xiv, s, grandson, philip, duke, of, anjou, if, he, refused, the, offer, would, pass, to, his, younger, brother, the, duke, of, berry, followed, by, archduke, charles, charles, died, on, 1, november, 1700, and, on, the, 9th, spanish, ambassadors, formally, offered, the, throne, to, philip, louis, briefly, considered, refusing, although, it, meant, the, succession, of, archduke, charles, insisting, william, help, him, enforce, the, treaty, of, london, meant, he, might, achieve, his, territorial, aims, without, fighting, however, his, son, the, dauphin, rejected, the, idea, french, diplomats, also, advised, austria, would, fight, regardless, while, neither, the, british, nor, dutch, would, go, to, war, for, a, settlement, intended, to, avoid, war, louis, therefore, accepted, on, behalf, of, his, grandson, who, was, proclaimed, philip, v, of, spain, on, 16, november, 1700, with, most, of, his, objectives, achieved, by, diplomacy, louis, now, made, a, series, of, moves, that, combined, to, make, war, inevitable, the, tory, majority, in, the, english, parliament, objected, to, the, partition, treaties, chiefly, the, french, acquisition, of, sicily, an, important, link, in, the, lucrative, levant, trade, however, a, foreign, diplomat, observed, their, refusal, to, become, involved, in, a, european, war, was, true, only, so, long, as, english, commerce, does, not, suffer, louis, either, failed, to, appreciate, this, or, decided, to, ignore, it, and, his, actions, gradually, eroded, tory, opposition, in, early, 1701, louis, registered, philip, s, claim, to, the, french, throne, with, the, parlement, of, paris, raising, the, possibility, of, union, with, spain, contrary, to, charles, will, though, philip, was, only, third, in, the, french, succession, in, february, the, spanish, controlled, duchy, of, milan, and, allied, duchy, of, mantua, in, northern, italy, announced, their, support, for, philip, and, accepted, french, troops, combined, with, efforts, to, build, an, alliance, between, france, and, imperial, german, states, in, swabia, and, franconia, these, were, challenges, leopold, could, not, ignore, helped, by, the, governor, max, emanuel, of, bavaria, french, troops, replaced, dutch, garrisons, in, the, barrier, fortresses, in, the, spanish, netherlands, granted, at, ryswick, it, also, threatened, the, dutch, monopoly, over, the, scheldt, granted, by, the, 1648, peace, of, m, nster, while, french, control, of, antwerp, and, ostend, would, allow, them, to, blockade, the, english, channel, at, will, combined, with, other, french, actions, that, threatened, english, trade, this, produced, a, clear, majority, for, war, and, in, may, 1701, parliament, urged, william, to, negotiate, an, anti, french, alliance, on, 7, september, leopold, the, dutch, republic, and, britain, signed, the, treaty, of, the, hague, renewing, the, 1689, grand, alliance, its, provisions, included, securing, the, dutch, barrier, in, the, spanish, netherlands, the, protestant, succession, in, england, and, scotland, and, an, independent, spain, but, did, not, refer, to, placing, archduke, charles, on, the, spanish, throne, when, the, exiled, james, ii, of, england, died, on, 16, september, 1701, louis, reneged, on, his, recognition, of, the, protestant, william, iii, as, king, of, england, and, scotland, and, supported, the, claim, of, james, son, james, francis, edward, stuart, war, became, inevitable, and, when, william, himself, died, in, march, 1702, his, successor, queen, anne, confirmed, her, support, for, the, treaty, of, the, hague, the, dutch, now, led, by, grand, pensionary, anthonie, heinsius, did, the, same, despite, french, hopes, that, without, a, stadtholder, the, republic, would, be, torn, apart, internally, on, 8, may, the, dutch, republic, declared, war, on, france, followed, by, the, british, and, the, emperor, on, 15, may, and, the, imperial, diet, on, 30, september, the, importance, of, trade, and, economic, interests, to, the, participants, is, often, underestimated, contemporaries, viewed, dutch, and, english, support, for, the, habsburg, cause, as, primarily, driven, by, a, desire, for, access, to, spanish, markets, in, the, americas, while, modern, economists, generally, assume, a, constantly, growing, market, the, then, dominant, theory, of, mercantilism, viewed, it, as, relatively, static, this, meant, increasing, your, own, share, of, a, market, required, taking, it, from, someone, else, with, the, state, facilitating, this, by, attacking, opponents, merchant, ships, and, colonies, as, a, result, the, war, quickly, expanded, to, north, america, india, and, other, parts, of, asia, with, tariffs, used, as, a, policy, weapon, the, 1651, 1663, navigation, acts, were, a, major, factor, in, the, anglo, dutch, wars, while, between, 1690, and, 1704, english, import, duties, on, foreign, goods, increased, by, 400, on, 6, september, 1700, france, banned, the, import, of, english, manufactured, goods, such, as, cloth, and, imposed, prohibitive, duties, on, a, wide, range, of, others, the, field, armies, that, operated, in, the, southern, netherlands, during, the, nine, years, war, had, often, reached, 100, 000, men, the, size, of, armies, continued, to, grow, during, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, between, 1702, and, 1707, the, field, armies, in, the, southern, netherlands, had, a, strength, of, 60, 000, to, 80, 000, men, and, from, 1708, onwards, over, 120, 000, men, these, extensive, armies, placed, immense, strain, on, pre, industrial, economies, armies, were, restricted, by, their, dependence, on, water, borne, transport, for, supplies, so, campaigns, focused, on, rivers, like, the, rhine, and, adda, while, their, absence, limited, operations, in, areas, like, northern, spain, better, logistics, unified, command, and, simpler, internal, lines, of, communication, gave, bourbon, armies, an, advantage, over, their, opponents, in, 1700, spain, remained, a, great, power, in, terms, of, territory, control, recent, research, moreover, shows, that, imports, of, bullion, from, the, americas, reached, their, highest, level, between, 1670, and, 1700, however, this, concealed, major, structural, weaknesses, the, vast, majority, of, these, imports, were, used, to, fund, debt, or, pay, foreign, merchants, when, the, new, bourbon, administration, took, over, in, 1701, they, found, the, empire, bankrupt, and, effectively, defenceless, with, fewer, than, 15, 000, troops, in, spain, itself, and, a, navy, consisting, of, 20, ships, in, total, almost, constant, warfare, during, the, 17th, century, made, the, economy, subject, to, long, periods, of, low, productivity, and, depression, and, largely, reliant, upon, others, for, its, prosperity, in, many, ways, the, continued, existence, of, the, empire, was, not, due, to, spanish, strength, but, to, maintain, a, balance, between, the, powers, competing, for, a, share, of, its, markets, despite, fighting, a, series, of, wars, against, spain, from, 1667, to, 1697, france, was, also, its, most, significant, economic, partner, supplying, labour, and, controlling, a, large, proportion, of, its, foreign, trade, this, consideration, was, an, important, factor, in, the, decision, to, name, philip, his, heir, its, dependence, on, others, was, illustrated, in, 1703, despite, the, presence, of, an, invading, allied, army, the, french, ambassador, urged, louis, to, allow, dutch, and, english, merchants, to, purchase, wool, from, spanish, farmers, otherwise, the, flocks, cannot, be, maintained, enacting, political, or, economic, reform, was, extremely, complex, since, habsburg, spain, was, a, personal, union, between, the, crowns, of, castile, and, aragon, each, with, very, different, political, cultures, most, of, philip, s, support, came, from, the, castilian, elite, the, spanish, netherlands, had, been, governed, by, prince, elector, max, emanuel, of, bavaria, since, 1692, while, links, with, italy, traditionally, the, major, source, of, spanish, recruits, and, funding, had, been, weakened, by, decades, of, neglect, and, heavy, taxation, it, was, widely, if, reluctantly, accepted, in, madrid, that, preserving, an, independent, spanish, empire, required, comprehensive, reforms, including, the, elimination, of, the, privileges, or, fueros, held, by, the, aragonese, states, it, was, no, coincidence, archduke, charles, had, strong, support, in, areas, that, were, part, of, the, crown, of, aragon, including, catalonia, and, valencia, under, louis, xiv, france, was, the, most, powerful, state, in, europe, with, revenue, generating, capacities, that, far, exceeded, those, of, its, rivals, its, geographical, position, provided, enormous, tactical, flexibility, unlike, austria, it, had, a, navy, and, as, the, campaigns, of, 1708, 1710, proved, even, under, severe, pressure, it, could, defend, its, borders, the, nine, years, war, had, shown, france, could, not, impose, its, objectives, without, support, and, its, new, alliance, with, spain, and, bavaria, made, a, successful, outcome, more, likely, however, the, previous, wars, had, left, france, with, severe, economic, problems, this, was, recognized, by, the, marquis, de, chamlay, who, advised, louis, to, not, take, on, a, purely, offensive, strategy, he, argued, that, the, combined, might, of, the, grand, alliance, forces, made, it, highly, improbable, for, france, to, launch, a, successful, attack, the, dutch, and, imperial, fortresses, were, located, far, from, convenient, franco, spanish, bases, and, the, netherlands, and, rhineland, lacked, easily, navigable, rivers, for, the, bourbon, armies, furthermore, besieging, a, major, dutch, fortress, demanded, the, commitment, of, two, full, armies, the, french, would, thus, pursue, a, strategy, described, as, a, mixed, war, in, europe, in, this, strategy, the, franco, spanish, forces, would, primarily, assume, a, defensive, posture, to, safeguard, the, vital, fortresses, they, needed, to, retain, offensive, actions, on, the, other, hand, were, characterized, by, assertive, posturing, and, strategic, positioning, with, an, emphasis, on, sustaining, their, forces, by, living, off, enemy, territory, whenever, feasible, while, blocking, enemy, thrusts, and, trying, to, engage, them, in, battle, where, possible, apart, from, denying, an, undivided, spanish, monarchy, to, others, louis, s, objectives, were, to, secure, his, borders, with, the, holy, roman, empire, weaken, his, rival, austria, and, increase, french, commercial, strength, through, access, to, trade, with, the, americas, despite, being, the, dominant, power, within, the, holy, roman, empire, austrian, and, imperial, interests, did, not, always, coincide, the, habsburgs, wanted, to, put, archduke, charles, on, the, throne, of, an, undivided, spanish, monarchy, while, their, allies, were, fighting, to, prevent, either, the, bourbons, or, the, habsburgs, from, doing, so, this, divergence, and, austria, s, financial, collapse, in, 1703, meant, the, campaign, in, spain, was, reliant, on, anglo, dutch, naval, support, and, after, 1706, british, funding, particularly, during, the, reign, of, joseph, i, the, priority, for, the, habsburgs, was, to, secure, their, southern, borders, from, french, intervention, in, northern, italy, and, suppress, r, k, czi, s, war, of, independence, in, hungary, much, of, the, spanish, nobility, resented, what, they, considered, to, be, the, arrogance, of, the, austrians, a, key, factor, in, the, selection, of, philip, as, their, preferred, candidate, in, 1700, in, return, for, british, support, charles, agreed, to, major, commercial, concessions, within, the, empire, as, well, as, accepting, british, control, of, gibraltar, and, menorca, these, made, him, widely, unpopular, at, all, levels, of, spanish, society, and, he, was, never, able, to, sustain, himself, outside, the, coastal, regions, which, could, be, supplied, by, the, anglo, dutch, navies, the, wittelsbach, controlled, states, of, bavaria, li, ge, and, cologne, allied, with, france, but, the, vast, majority, of, the, empire, remained, neutral, or, limited, their, involvement, to, the, supply, of, mercenaries, like, bavaria, the, larger, entities, pursued, their, own, policies, his, claim, to, the, polish, crown, meant, augustus, of, saxony, focused, on, the, great, northern, war, while, frederick, i, made, his, support, dependent, on, leopold, recognising, prussia, as, a, kingdom, and, making, it, an, equal, member, of, the, grand, alliance, since, george, elector, of, hanover, was, also, heir, to, the, british, throne, his, support, was, more, reliable, but, the, suspicion, remained, that, the, interests, of, hanover, came, first, british, foreign, policy, was, based, on, three, general, principles, which, remained, largely, consistent, from, the, 16th, through, the, 20th, centuries, the, first, overriding, all, others, was, to, preserve, a, balance, of, power, in, europe, an, objective, threatened, by, french, expansion, under, louis, xiv, the, second, was, to, prevent, the, low, countries, from, being, controlled, by, a, hostile, power, or, one, stronger, than, britain, this, included, both, the, spanish, netherlands, and, the, dutch, republic, whose, deep, harbours, and, prevailing, winds, made, her, a, natural, embarkation, point, for, an, attack, on, england, as, demonstrated, in, 1688, the, third, was, to, maintain, a, navy, strong, enough, to, protect, british, trade, control, her, waters, and, launch, attacks, on, her, enemies, commercial, routes, and, coastal, areas, alignment, on, reducing, the, power, of, france, and, securing, the, protestant, succession, for, the, british, throne, masked, differences, on, how, to, achieve, them, in, general, the, tories, favoured, a, mercantilist, strategy, of, using, the, royal, navy, to, attack, french, and, spanish, trade, while, protecting, and, expanding, their, own, land, commitments, were, viewed, as, expensive, and, primarily, of, benefit, to, others, the, whigs, argued, france, could, not, be, defeated, by, seapower, alone, making, a, continental, strategy, essential, while, britain, s, financial, strength, made, it, the, only, member, of, the, alliance, able, to, operate, on, all, fronts, against, france, the, dutch, had, been, engaged, in, the, struggle, to, contain, france, since, the, rampjaar, disaster, year, of, 1672, when, the, dutch, republic, had, nearly, been, overrun, by, the, french, army, apart, from, the, worry, about, the, balance, of, power, the, dutch, had, long, been, concerned, with, the, fate, of, the, spanish, netherlands, viewing, it, as, a, strategic, buffer, against, france, this, perception, endured, even, during, periods, of, alliance, with, france, as, evidenced, by, the, popularity, of, the, motto, gallicus, amicus, non, vicinus, france, is, a, good, friend, not, a, good, neighbour, within, the, dutch, republic, the, war, of, devolution, 1667, 68, and, the, franco, dutch, war, 1672, 78, showed, the, spanish, could, not, defend, the, southern, netherlands, and, so, the, 1697, treaty, of, ryswick, allowed, the, dutch, to, place, garrisons, in, eight, key, cities, they, hoped, this, barrier, would, provide, the, strategic, depth, needed, to, protect, their, commercial, and, demographic, heartlands, around, amsterdam, against, attack, from, the, south, however, with, the, help, of, maximilian, of, bavaria, the, governor, of, the, spanish, netherlands, the, dutch, garrison, troops, had, been, replaced, by, french, troops, by, 1701, dutch, priorities, were, to, re, establish, and, strengthen, the, barrier, fortresses, retain, control, of, the, economically, vital, scheldt, estuary, and, gain, access, to, trade, in, the, spanish, empire, although, the, english, duke, of, marlborough, was, allied, commander, in, the, low, countries, the, dutch, provided, most, of, the, manpower, and, supplies, strategy, in, this, theatre, was, thus, subject, to, the, approval, of, their, field, deputies, and, generals, when, dutch, forces, operated, outside, the, spanish, netherlands, this, was, often, a, concession, to, their, english, allies, throughout, the, 17th, century, savoy, sought, to, replace, spain, as, the, dominant, power, in, northern, italy, savoy, consisted, of, two, main, geographic, segments, piedmont, which, contained, the, capital, turin, and, the, duchy, of, aosta, on, the, italian, side, of, the, alps, with, the, duchy, of, savoy, and, county, of, nice, in, transalpine, france, the, latter, were, almost, impossible, to, defend, and, combined, with, the, anti, habsburg, policy, pursued, by, louis, xiv, and, his, predecessors, this, meant, savoy, generally, sided, with, france, however, piedmont, provided, foreign, powers, access, to, the, restive, southern, french, provinces, of, the, dauphin, and, vaunage, former, huguenot, strongholds, with, a, long, history, of, rebellion, this, provided, victor, amadeus, ii, with, a, degree, of, leverage, allowing, him, to, manoeuvre, between, opposing, parties, to, expand, his, territories, during, the, nine, years, war, in, 1690, savoy, joined, the, grand, alliance, before, agreeing, to, a, separate, peace, with, france, in, 1696, the, accession, of, philip, v, in, 1701, led, to, a, reversal, of, long, standing, strategic, policy, with, france, now, supporting, the, spanish, position, in, lombardy, rather, than, seeking, to, weaken, it, and, austria, doing, the, opposite, while, victor, amadeus, initially, allied, savoy, with, france, his, long, term, goal, was, the, acquisition, of, the, duchy, of, milan, which, neither, bourbons, nor, habsburgs, would, relinquish, voluntarily, as, discussed, elsewhere, in, this, article, securing, his, borders, in, italy, was, of, greater, concern, to, emperor, leopold, than, spain, itself, this, meant, britain, was, the, only, power, inclined, to, help, victor, amadeus, achieve, this, objective, and, he, changed, sides, in, 1703, after, the, anglo, dutch, navies, won, control, of, the, western, mediterranean, the, war, in, italy, primarily, involved, the, spanish, ruled, duchy, of, milan, and, the, french, allied, duchy, of, mantua, considered, essential, to, the, security, of, austria, s, southern, borders, in, 1701, french, troops, occupied, both, cities, and, victor, amadeus, ii, duke, of, savoy, allied, with, france, his, daughter, maria, luisa, marrying, philip, v, in, may, 1701, an, imperial, army, under, prince, eugene, of,

forced, the, imperialists, into, the, trentino, valley, however, in, july, 1706, vend, me, and, any, available, forces, were, sent, to, reinforce, france, s, northern, frontier, after, the, defeat, at, ramillies, reinforced, by, german, auxiliaries, led, by, leopold, of, anhalt, dessau, prince, eugene, broke, the, siege, of, turin, in, september, despite, a, minor, french, victory, at,

france, a, combined, savoyard, imperial, attack, on, the, french, base, of, toulon, planned, for, april, was, postponed, when, imperial, troops, were, diverted, to, seize, the, spanish, bourbon, kingdom, of, naples, by, the, time, they, besieged, toulon, in, august, the, french, were, too, strong, and, they, were, forced, to, withdraw, by, the, end, of, 1707, fighting, in, italy, ceased, apart, from, small, scale, attempts, by, victor, amadeus, to, recover, nice, and, savoy, the, first, objective, for, the, grand, alliance, in, this, theatre, was, to, secure, the, dutch, frontiers, threatened, by, the, alliance, between, france, bavaria, and, joseph, clemens, of, bavaria, ruler, of, li, ge, and, cologne, during, 1702, the, grand, alliance, repelled, an, assault, on, nijmegen, captured, kaiserswerth, a, strong, town, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, dutch, republic, and, took, venlo, roermond, stevensweert, and, li, ge, along, the, meuse, the, 1703, campaign, was, marred, by, allied, conflicts, over, strategy, despite, capturing, bonn, they, failed, to, take, antwerp, while, a, dutch, contingent, narrowly, escaped, disaster, at, ekeren, in, june, on, the, upper, rhine, imperial, forces, under, louis, william, margrave, of, baden, baden, remained, on, the, defensive, although, they, took, landau, in, 1702, supported, by, the, bavarians, during, the, 1703, campaign, french, forces, retook, landau, won, victories, at, friedlingen, h, chst, dt, and, speyerbach, then, captured, kehl, and, breisach, with, austrian, resources, absorbed, by, r, k, czi, s, war, of, independence, in, hungary, the, franco, bavarian, plan, for, 1704, was, to, march, on, vienna, to, relieve, the, pressure, marlborough, marched, up, the, rhine, joined, forces, with, louis, of, baden, and, prince, eugene, and, crossed, the, danube, on, 2, july, allied, victory, at, blenheim, on, 13, august, forced, bavaria, out, of, the, war, and, the, treaty, of, ilbersheim, placed, it, under, austrian, rule, allied, efforts, to, exploit, their, victory, in, 1705, floundered, on, poor, coordination, tactical, disputes, and, command, rivalries, a, diplomatic, crisis, between, the, dutch, republic, and, england, was, only, averted, by, the, dismissal, of, general, slangenburg, while, the, imposition, of, austrian, rule, in, bavaria, caused, a, brief, but, vicious, peasant, revolt, in, may, 1706, the, french, were, comprehensively, defeated, at, ramillies, by, an, allied, army, under, marlborough, which, then, occupied, much, of, the, spanish, netherlands, in, under, two, weeks, france, assumed, a, largely, defensive, posture, for, the, rest, of, the, war, the, 1707, campaign, was, without, any, significant, events, as, both, parties, focussed, on, other, fronts, the, french, now, under, marshal, vend, me, avoided, battle, and, marlborough, did, little, to, force, one, upon, them, by, 1708, the, focus, of, both, sides, was, again, almost, entirely, on, the, fighting, in, the, low, countries, the, allies, once, more, set, their, sights, on, breaking, french, fortification, belts, while, the, french, themselves, planned, a, major, counteroffensive, although, this, counteroffensive, was, initially, successful, when, the, french, surprised, the, allied, garrisons, at, ghent, and, bruges, it, failed, after, the, allies, defeated, them, at, the, battle, of, oudenaarde, in, its, aftermath, the, allies, managed, to, capture, lille, the, strongest, fortress, of, the, french, fortress, belts, while, a, french, assault, on, brussels, was, reppelled, and, ghent, and, bruges, recaptured, but, despite, losses, like, lille, and, other, strongpoints, the, french, would, prevent, the, allies, from, making, a, decisive, breach, in, their, frontiers, british, involvement, was, primarily, driven, by, the, need, to, protect, their, trade, routes, in, the, mediterranean, by, putting, archduke, charles, on, the, spanish, throne, they, also, hoped, to, gain, commercial, privileges, within, the, spanish, empire, despite, their, dynastic, claim, the, austrian, habsburgs, viewed, securing, northern, italy, and, suppressing, the, hungarian, revolt, as, higher, priorities, with, the, dutch, focusing, on, flanders, post, 1704, this, theatre, was, largely, dependent, on, british, naval, and, military, support, spain, at, the, time, was, a, personal, union, between, the, crowns, of, castile, and, aragon, the, latter, was, further, divided, into, the, separate, entities, of, catalonia, aragon, valencia, majorca, sicily, naples, and, sardinia, in, 1701, majorca, naples, sicily, and, sardinia, declared, for, philip, while, a, mixture, of, anti, castilian, and, anti, french, sentiment, meant, the, others, supported, archduke, charles, the, most, important, being, catalonia, allied, victory, at, vigo, bay, in, october, 1702, persuaded, peter, ii, of, portugal, to, switch, sides, giving, them, an, operational, base, in, this, area, archduke, charles, landed, at, lisbon, in, march, 1704, to, begin, a, land, campaign, while, the, british, dutch, capture, of, gibraltar, was, a, significant, blow, to, bourbon, prestige, an, attempt, to, retake, it, was, defeated, in, august, with, a, land, siege, being, abandoned, in, april, 1705, the, 1705, pact, of, genoa, between, catalan, representatives, and, britain, opened, a, second, front, in, the, north, east, the, loss, of, barcelona, and, valencia, left, toulon, as, the, only, major, port, available, to, the, bourbons, in, the, western, mediterranean, philip, tried, to, retake, barcelona, in, may, 1706, but, was, repulsed, while, his, absence, allowed, an, allied, force, from, portugal, to, enter, madrid, and, zaragoza, however, lack, of, popular, support, and, logistical, issues, meant, the, allies, could, not, hold, territory, away, from, the, coastline, and, by, november, philip, controlled, castile, murcia, and, parts, of, valencia, allied, efforts, to, regain, the, initiative, ended, with, defeat, at, almansa, in, april, 1707, followed, by, an, unsuccessful, siege, of, toulon, in, august, despite, these, failures, control, of, gibraltar, and, the, capture, of, menorca, in, 1708, allowed, the, royal, navy, to, dominate, the, western, mediterranean, since, many, british, politicians, considered, this, their, primary, objective, they, became, reluctant, to, approve, further, expensive, land, campaigns, in, this, theatre, the, close, links, between, war, and, trade, meant, conflict, extended, beyond, europe, particularly, in, north, america, where, it, is, known, as, queen, anne, s, war, and, the, west, indies, which, produced, sugar, then, a, hugely, profitable, commodity, also, there, were, minor, trade, conflicts, in, south, america, india, and, asia, the, financial, strains, of, war, particularly, affected, the, dutch, east, india, company, as, it, was, a, huge, drain, on, scarce, naval, resources, related, conflicts, include, r, k, czi, s, war, of, independence, in, hungary, which, was, funded, by, france, and, a, serious, concern, for, the, habsburgs, throughout, the, war, in, south, eastern, france, britain, funded, the, huguenot, 1704, 1710, camisard, rebellion, one, objective, of, the, 1707, campaign, in, northern, italy, and, southern, france, was, to, support, this, revolt, one, of, a, series, that, began, in, the, 1620s, by, the, end, of, 1708, the, french, had, withdrawn, from, northern, italy, while, the, maritime, powers, controlled, the, spanish, netherlands, and, secured, the, borders, of, the, dutch, republic, in, the, mediterranean, the, maritime, powers, had, achieved, naval, supremacy, and, britain, acquired, permanent, bases, in, gibraltar, and, menorca, however, as, marlborough, himself, pointed, out, the, french, frontiers, remained, largely, intact, their, army, showed, no, signs, of, being, defeated, while, philip, proved, far, more, popular, with, the, spanish, than, his, rival, many, of, the, objectives, set, out, by, the, grand, alliance, in, 1701, had, been, achieved, but, success, in, 1708, made, them, overconfident, french, diplomats, focused, on, the, dutch, whom, they, considered, were, more, likely, to, favour, peace, than, their, allies, for, victory, at, ramillies, removed, any, direct, military, threat, to, the, republic, while, highlighting, differences, with, britain, on, the, spanish, netherlands, peace, talks, broke, down, in, late, 1708, because, the, allies, had, agreed, not, to, negotiate, a, separate, peace, but, could, not, agree, on, the, terms, the, great, frost, of, 1709, caused, widespread, famine, in, france, and, spain, forcing, louis, to, re, open, negotiations, and, he, hinted, at, his, willingness, to, cede, french, fortresses, to, the, dutch, republic, in, may, 1709, the, allies, presented, him, with, the, preliminaries, of, the, hague, britain, and, austria, still, insisted, on, an, undivided, spanish, monarchy, for, archduke, charles, the, allies, demanded, that, philip, was, given, two, months, to, cede, his, throne, to, charles, while, france, was, required, to, remove, him, by, force, if, he, did, not, comply, besides, having, to, cede, the, strongholds, thionville, cambrai, and, valenciennes, as, collateral, although, spain, was, of, less, importance, to, them, the, dutch, negotiators, led, by, heinsius, considered, these, strict, conditions, necessary, to, ensure, that, peace, conditions, were, honoured, as, they, doubted, louis, sincerity, they, were, concerned, that, the, allies, would, still, have, to, exhaust, themselves, in, spain, while, france, after, a, period, of, recuperation, might, once, again, lend, support, to, phillip, many, allied, statesmen, including, marlborough, assumed, philip, would, abdicate, on, request, and, felt, that, the, terms, seriously, underestimated, france, s, ability, to, continue, the, war, they, also, required, the, spanish, to, accept, archduke, charles, as, king, in, his, place, which, they, were, certainly, unwilling, to, do, as, demonstrated, by, the, failure, of, allied, campaigns, to, hold, territory, outside, catalonia, although, louis, seemed, willing, to, abandon, his, ambitions, in, spain, making, war, on, his, grandson, was, unacceptable, a, stipulation, so, offensive, that, when, made, public, the, french, resolved, to, fight, on, following, success, in, the, siege, of, tournai, marlborough, s, 1709, offensive, in, northern, france, culminated, in, the, battle, of, malplaquet, on, 11, september, a, nominal, allied, victory, but, one, in, which, their, total, casualties, numbered, 22, 000, out, of, 86, 000, soldiers, the, dutch, infantry, losing, 8, 500, out, of, 18, 000, although, the, french, strategic, position, continued, to, deteriorate, the, battle, showed, that, their, fighting, abilities, had, remained, intact, and, increased, war, weariness, in, both, britain, and, the, dutch, republic, more, significant, were, franco, spanish, victories, at, alicante, in, april, and, la, gudina, in, may, which, showed, that, a, successful, military, solution, in, spain, for, the, allies, now, appeared, remote, shortly, after, the, dutch, discovered, they, had, been, excluded, from, a, commercial, agreement, signed, by, archduke, charles, which, granted, britain, exclusive, trading, rights, in, spanish, america, this, deepened, divisions, between, the, allies, while, increasing, spanish, opposition, to, having, the, archduke, as, their, king, the, whig, government, in, london, was, however, afraid, to, push, the, dutch, into, the, hands, of, the, french, and, went, back, on, their, commercial, agreement, with, archduke, charles, in, exchange, for, a, dutch, guarantee, to, support, the, hanoverian, succession, britain, agreed, to, share, trading, rights, in, spanish, america, and, the, mediterranean, additionally, the, whigs, promised, the, dutch, a, significantly, expanded, barrier, in, the, spanish, netherlands, including, key, fortress, towns, such, as, lille, valenciennes, cond, and, maubeuge, the, dutch, now, seemed, to, obtain, all, they, had, ever, wanted, outset, of, the, war, not, only, in, the, low, countries, but, also, in, the, mediterranean, and, america, it, however, proved, to, be, an, awkward, and, ill, fated, agreement, the, treaty, quickly, sparked, resentment, particularly, from, the, emperor, who, was, offended, by, the, heavy, burden, it, imposed, on, charles, s, sovereignty, over, the, southern, netherlands, while, in, britain, the, new, treaty, led, to, heavy, opposition, by, the, tories, as, they, saw, it, as, detrimental, to, british, commerce, the, whigs, had, won, the, 1708, british, general, election, by, arguing, military, victory, was, the, quickest, road, to, peace, but, failure, in, france, was, mirrored, in, spain, archduke, charles, re, entered, madrid, in, 1710, after, victories, at, almenar, and, saragossa, but, the, allies, could, not, hold, the, interior, and, were, forced, to, retreat, 3, 500, british, troops, surrendered, at, brihuega, on, 8, december, while, the, battle, of, villaviciosa, on, 10, december, confirmed, bourbon, control, of, spain, at, the, same, time, costs, continued, to, spiral, the, dutch, were, close, to, bankruptcy, while, austrian, troops, were, almost, entirely, funded, by, britain, in, 1709, parliament, approved, expenditures, of, 6, 4, million, up, from, 5, 0, million, in, 1706, by, the, end, of, 1710, these, had, doubled, to, 12, 9, million, despite, minimal, gains, when, talks, resumed, at, geertruidenberg, in, march, 1710, louis, now, even, showed, a, willingness, to, assist, the, allies, in, removing, his, grandson, from, spain, the, dutch, proposed, compensating, philip, with, sicily, and, sardinia, but, neither, the, austrians, or, british, would, agree, and, negotiations, broke, down, again, however, it, was, clear, to, the, french, the, mood, in, britain, had, changed, this, was, confirmed, when, the, pro, peace, tories, won, a, landslide, victory, in, the, october, 1710, british, election, although, they, confirmed, their, commitment, to, the, war, to, prevent, a, credit, crisis, despite, the, capture, of, bouchain, in, september, a, decisive, victory, in, northern, france, continued, to, elude, the, allies, while, an, attack, on, quebec, ended, in, disaster, when, emperor, joseph, died, in, april, 1711, his, brother, archduke, charles, was, elected, emperor, for, the, dutch, and, british, his, accession, undermined, a, key, reason, for, continuing, the, war, since, a, union, of, spain, with, austria, was, as, unwelcome, as, one, with, france, the, british, secretly, negotiated, peace, terms, directly, with, france, leading, to, the, signing, of, the, preliminary, articles, of, london, on, 8, october, 1711, these, included, french, acceptance, of, the, act, of, settlement, 1701, and, a, guarantee, the, french, and, spanish, crowns, would, remain, separate, in, addition, france, undertook, to, ensure, spain, ceded, gibraltar, and, menorca, while, giving, britain, a, thirty, year, monopoly, on, the, asiento, de, negros, the, right, to, import, slaves, into, spanish, american, colonies, despite, their, resentment, at, being, excluded, from, these, talks, the, dutch, were, financially, exhausted, by, the, war, and, could, not, continue, without, british, support, charles, vi, initially, rejected, the, idea, of, a, peace, conference, only, agreeing, once, the, dutch, decided, to, support, it, but, continued, to, oppose, the, treaty, within, weeks, of, the, conference, opening, events, threatened, the, basis, of, the, peace, agreed, between, britain, and, france, first, the, french, presented, proposals, awarding, the, spanish, netherlands, to, max, emmanuel, of, bavaria, and, a, minimal, barrier, leaving, the, dutch, with, little, to, show, for, their, huge, investment, of, money, and, men, second, a, series, of, deaths, left, louis, xiv, s, two, year, old, great, grandson, the, future, louis, xv, as, heir, making, philip, next, in, line, and, his, immediate, renunciation, imperative, the, dutch, and, austrians, fought, on, hoping, to, improve, their, negotiating, position, but, the, new, british, government, ordered, marlborough, s, replacement, james, butler, 2nd, duke, of, ormonde, not, to, participate, in, offensive, operations, against, the, french, these, orders, caused, fury, then, and, later, with, whigs, urging, hanoverian, military, intervention, those, considered, responsible, including, ormonde, and, the, tory, statesman, henry, st, john, 1st, viscount, bolingbroke, were, driven, into, exile, when, george, i, succeeded, queen, anne, in, 1714, and, became, prominent, jacobites, prince, eugene, captured, le, quesnoy, in, june, and, besieged, landrecies, but, was, defeated, at, denain, on, 24, july, the, french, then, went, on, to, recapture, le, quesnoy, and, other, towns, lost, in, previous, two, years, including, marchines, douai, and, bouchain, this, showed, the, french, retained, their, fighting, ability, while, the, dutch, had, finally, reached, the, end, of, their, willingness, and, ability, to, continue, the, war, on, 6, june, philip, confirmed, his, renunciation, of, the, french, throne, and, the, british, offered, the, dutch, a, revised, barrier, treaty, replacing, that, of, 1709, which, they, rejected, as, overly, generous, a, significant, improvement, on, the, 1697, barrier, it, was, subject, to, austrian, approval, and, while, less, beneficial, the, final, terms, were, sufficient, for, the, dutch, to, agree, despite, this, negotiations, dragged, on, until, 1715, as, the, austrians, were, reluctant, to, pay, for, dutch, garrisons, stationed, in, their, territory, although, british, pressure, meant, the, issue, was, ultimately, concluded, in, favour, of, the, dutch, charles, withdrew, from, the, conference, when, france, insisted, he, guarantee, not, to, acquire, mantua, or, mirandola, he, was, supported, by, the, future, george, i, who, wanted, france, to, withdraw, backing, for, the, stuart, heir, james, francis, as, a, result, neither, austria, nor, the, empire, signed, the, peace, of, utrecht, of, 11, april, 1713, between, france, and, the, other, allies, spain, made, peace, with, the, dutch, in, june, then, savoy, and, britain, on, 13, july, 1713, fighting, continued, on, the, rhine, but, austria, was, financially, exhausted, and, after, the, loss, of, landau, and, freiburg, in, november, 1713, charles, finally, made, peace, on, 7, march, 1714, in, the, treaty, of, rastatt, the, habsburg, monarchy, acceded, to, the, terms, of, utrecht, which, confirmed, their, gains, in, southern, italy, returned, breisach, kehl, and, freiburg, ended, french, support, for, the, hungarian, revolt, and, agreed, on, terms, for, the, dutch, barrier, fortresses, charles, abandoned, his, claim, to, strasbourg, and, alsace, and, agreed, to, the, restoration, of, the, wittelsbach, electors, of, bavaria, and, cologne, max, emmanuel, and, joseph, clemens, lifting, the, imperial, ban, on, them, article, xix, of, the, treaty, transferred, sovereignty, over, the, spanish, netherlands, to, austria, on, 7, september, the, holy, roman, empire, joined, the, agreement, by, the, treaty, of, baden, although, catalonia, and, majorca, were, not, finally, subdued, by, the, bourbons, until, june, 1715, the, war, was, over, article, ii, of, the, peace, of, utrecht, included, the, stipulation, because, of, the, great, danger, which, threatened, the, liberty, and, safety, of, all, europe, from, the, too, close, conjunction, of, the, kingdoms, of, spain, and, france, the, same, person, should, never, become, king, of, both, kingdoms, some, historians, view, this, as, a, key, point, in, the, evolution, of, the, modern, nation, state, randall, lesaffer, argues, it, marks, a, significant, milestone, in, the, concept, of, collective, security, philip, was, confirmed, as, king, of, spain, which, retained, its, independence, and, the, majority, of, its, empire, in, return, for, ceding, the, spanish, netherlands, most, of, its, italian, possessions, as, well, as, gibraltar, and, menorca, these, losses, were, deeply, felt, naples, and, sicily, were, regained, in, 1735, and, menorca, in, 1782, although, gibraltar, would, still, be, held, by, britain, despite, numerous, attempts, to, regain, it, the, 1707, nueva, planta, decrees, centralised, power, in, madrid, and, abolished, regional, political, structures, including, the, crown, of, aragon, although, catalonia, and, majorca, remained, outside, the, system, until, 1767, their, economy, recovered, remarkably, quickly, and, the, house, of, bourbon, save, for, brief, interruptions, has, held, the, spanish, throne, ever, since, louis, xiv, died, on, 1, september, 1715, and, was, succeeded, by, his, five, year, old, great, grandson, louis, xv, on, his, deathbed, he, is, alleged, to, have, admitted, i, have, loved, war, too, well, true, or, not, while, the, final, settlement, was, far, more, favourable, than, the, allied, terms, of, 1709, it, is, hard, to, see, what, louis, gained, that, he, had, not, already, achieved, through, diplomacy, by, february, 1701, from, 1666, onward, french, policies, assumed, military, and, economic, superiority, over, their, rivals, but, this, was, no, longer, the, case, by, 1714, when, britain, appeared, to, have, overtaken, france, on, both, fronts, the, continued, widening, of, this, gap, as, british, trade, expanded, post, utrecht, was, viewed, by, louis, s, successors, as, a, permanent, threat, to, the, european, balance, of, power, seeking, to, reduce, this, was, a, major, factor, in, france, entering, the, 1740, 1748, war, of, the, austrian, succession, despite, the, failure, in, spain, austria, secured, its, position, in, italy, and, hungary, and, acquired, the, bulk, of, the, spanish, netherlands, even, after, reimbursing, the, dutch, for, the, cost, of, their, barrier, garrisons, the, increased, revenues, from, the, austrian, netherlands, funded, a, significant, expansion, of, the, austrian, army, the, habsburgs, also, acquired, the, duchies, of, milan, and, mantua, the, kingdoms, of, naples, and, sardinia, exchanged, in, 1720, for, sicily, and, a, dominance, over, italy, that, would, last, interrupted, by, napoleon, until, 1859, the, shift, of, habsburg, focus, away, from, germany, and, into, southern, europe, continued, with, victory, in, the, austro, turkish, war, of, 1716, 1718, their, position, as, the, dominant, power, within, the, holy, roman, empire, was, challenged, by, bavaria, hanover, prussia, and, saxony, who, increasingly, acted, as, independent, powers, in, 1742, charles, albert, of, bavaria, became, the, first, non, habsburg, emperor, in, over, 300, years, britain, is, usually, seen, as, the, main, beneficiary, of, utrecht, which, marked, its, rise, to, becoming, the, dominant, european, commercial, power, it, established, naval, superiority, over, its, competitors, acquired, the, strategic, mediterranean, ports, of, gibraltar, and, menorca, and, trading, rights, in, spanish, america, france, accepted, the, protestant, succession, ensuring, a, smooth, inheritance, by, george, i, in, august, 1714, while, agreeing, to, end, support, for, the, stuarts, in, the, 1716, anglo, french, treaty, although, the, war, left, all, participants, with, unprecedented, levels, of, government, debt, only, britain, was, able, to, finance, it, efficiently, providing, a, relative, advantage, over, its, competitors, the, dutch, had, successfully, recovered, their, positions, in, the, southern, netherlands, and, their, troops, were, central, to, the, alliance, which, halted, french, territorial, expansion, in, europe, until, a, new, cycle, began, in, 1792, however, the, war, left, them, effectively, bankrupt, and, inflicted, permanent, damage, on, the, dutch, merchant, navy, while, they, remained, the, dominant, economic, power, in, the, far, east, britain, took, over,
