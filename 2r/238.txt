the, aq, qoyunlu, or, the, white, sheep, turkomans, azerbaijani, a, qoyunlular, persian, was, a, culturally, persianate, sunni, turkoman, tribal, confederation, founded, in, the, diyarbakir, region, by, qara, yuluk, uthman, beg, they, ruled, parts, of, present, day, eastern, turkey, from, 1378, to, 1503, and, in, their, last, decades, also, ruled, armenia, azerbaijan, much, of, iran, iraq, and, oman, where, the, ruler, of, hormuz, recognised, aq, qoyunlu, suzerainty, the, aq, qoyunlu, empire, reached, its, zenith, under, uzun, hasan, the, name, aq, qoyunlu, literally, meaning, those, with, white, sheep, is, first, mentioned, in, late, 14th, century, sources, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, name, refers, to, old, totemic, symbols, but, according, to, rashid, al, din, hamadani, the, turks, were, forbidden, to, eat, the, flesh, of, their, totem, animals, and, so, this, is, unlikely, given, the, importance, of, mutton, in, the, diet, of, pastoral, nomads, another, hypothesis, is, that, the, name, refers, to, the, predominant, color, of, their, flocks, according, to, chronicles, from, the, byzantine, empire, the, aq, qoyunlu, are, first, attested, in, the, district, of, bayburt, south, of, the, pontic, mountains, from, at, least, the, 1340s, in, these, chronicles, tur, ali, beg, was, mentioned, as, lord, of, the, turks, of, amid, who, had, already, attained, the, rank, of, amir, under, the, ilkhan, ghazan, under, his, leadership, they, besieged, trebizond, but, failed, to, take, the, town, a, number, of, their, leaders, including, the, dynasty, s, founder, qara, yuluk, uthman, beg, married, byzantine, princesses, by, the, end, of, the, ilkhanid, period, in, the, mid, 14th, century, the, oghuz, tribes, that, comprised, the, aq, qoyunlu, confederation, roamed, the, summer, pastures, in, armenia, in, particular, the, upper, reaches, of, the, tigris, river, and, winter, pastures, between, the, towns, of, diyarbak, r, and, sivas, since, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, aq, qoyunlu, waged, constant, wars, with, another, tribal, confederation, of, the, oghuz, tribes, the, qara, qoyunlu, the, leading, aq, qoyunlu, tribe, was, the, bayandur, tribe, uzun, hasan, used, to, assert, the, claim, that, he, was, an, honorable, descendant, of, oghuz, khan, and, his, grandson, bayandur, khan, in, a, letter, dating, to, the, year, 1470, which, was, sent, to, ehzade, bayezid, the, then, governor, of, amasya, uzun, hasan, wrote, that, those, from, the, bayandur, and, bayat, tribes, as, well, as, other, tribes, that, belonged, to, the, oghuz, il, and, formerly, inhabited, mangyshlak, khwarazm, and, turkestan, came, and, served, in, his, court, he, also, made, the, tamga, seal, of, the, bayandur, tribe, the, symbol, of, his, state, for, this, reason, the, bayandur, tamga, is, found, in, aq, qoyunlu, coins, their, official, documents, inscriptions, and, flags, the, aq, qoyunlu, sultans, claimed, descent, from, bayindir, khan, who, was, a, grandson, of, oghuz, khan, the, legendary, ancestor, of, oghuz, turks, according, to, professor, g, l, lewis, the, ak, koyunlu, sultans, claimed, descent, from, bayindir, khan, and, it, is, likely, on, the, face, of, it, that, the, book, of, dede, korkut, was, composed, under, their, patronage, the, snag, about, this, is, that, in, the, ak, koyunlu, genealogy, bayindir, s, father, is, named, as, gok, sky, khan, son, of, the, eponymous, oghuz, khan, whereas, in, our, book, he, is, named, as, kam, ghan, a, name, otherwise, unknown, in, default, of, any, better, explanation, i, therefore, incline, to, the, belief, that, the, book, was, composed, before, ak, koyunlu, rulers, had, decided, who, their, ancestors, were, it, was, in, 1403, that, they, ceased, to, be, tribal, chiefs, and, became, sultans, so, we, may, assume, that, their, official, genealogy, was, formulated, round, about, that, date, according, to, the, kitab, i, diyarbakriyya, the, ancestors, of, uzun, hasan, back, to, the, prophet, adam, in, the, 68th, generation, are, listed, by, name, and, information, is, given, about, them, among, them, is, tur, ali, bey, the, grandfather, of, uzun, hasan, s, grandfather, who, is, also, mentioned, in, other, sources, but, it, is, difficult, to, say, whether, pehlivan, bey, ezdi, bey, and, idris, bey, who, are, listed, in, earlier, periods, really, existed, most, of, the, people, who, are, listed, as, the, ancestors, of, uzun, hasan, are, names, related, to, the, oghuz, legend, and, to, oghuz, rulers, the, aq, qoyunlu, turkomans, first, acquired, land, in, 1402, when, timur, granted, them, all, of, diyar, bakr, in, present, day, turkey, for, a, long, time, the, aq, qoyunlu, were, unable, to, expand, their, territory, as, the, rival, qara, qoyunlu, or, black, sheep, turkomans, kept, them, at, bay, however, this, changed, with, the, rule, of, uzun, hasan, who, defeated, the, black, sheep, turkoman, leader, jah, n, sh, h, in, 1467, after, the, death, of, jahan, shah, his, son, hasan, ali, with, the, help, of, timurid, abu, sa, id, mirza, marched, on, azerbaijan, to, meet, uzun, hasan, deciding, to, spend, the, winter, in, karabakh, abu, sa, id, was, captured, and, repulsed, by, uzun, hasan, as, the, former, advanced, towards, the, aras, river, after, the, defeat, of, the, timurid, leader, abu, sa, id, mirza, uzun, hasan, was, able, to, take, baghdad, along, with, territories, around, the, persian, gulf, he, expanded, into, iran, as, far, east, as, khorasan, however, around, this, time, the, ottoman, empire, sought, to, expand, eastwards, a, serious, threat, that, forced, the, aq, qoyunlu, into, an, alliance, with, the, karamanids, of, central, anatolia, as, early, as, 1464, uzun, hasan, had, requested, military, aid, from, one, of, the, ottoman, empire, s, strongest, enemies, venice, despite, venetian, promises, this, aid, never, arrived, and, as, a, result, uzun, hassan, was, defeated, by, the, ottomans, at, the, battle, of, otlukbeli, in, 1473, though, this, did, not, destroy, the, aq, qoyunlu, in, 1470, uzun, selected, abu, bakr, tihrani, to, compile, a, history, of, the, aq, qoyunlu, confederation, the, kitab, i, diyarbakriyya, written, in, persian, referred, to, uzun, hasan, as, sahib, qiran, and, was, the, first, historical, work, to, assign, this, title, to, a, non, timurid, ruler, uzun, hasan, preserved, relationships, with, the, members, of, the, popular, dervish, order, whose, main, inclinations, were, towards, shi, ism, while, promoting, the, urban, religious, establishment, with, donations, and, confirmations, of, tax, concessions, or, endowments, and, ordering, the, pursuit, of, extremist, shiite, and, antinomist, sects, he, married, one, of, his, daughters, to, his, nephew, haydar, the, new, head, of, the, safavid, sect, in, ardabil, when, uzun, hasan, died, early, in, 1478, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, khalil, mirza, but, the, latter, was, defeated, by, a, confederation, under, his, younger, brother, ya, qub, at, the, battle, of, khoy, in, july, 128, ya, qub, who, reigned, from, 1478, to, 1490, sustained, the, dynasty, for, a, while, longer, however, during, the, first,

and, alienated, a, large, part, of, the, people, especially, the, turks, therefore, the, vast, majority, of, turks, became, involved, in, the, safawiya, order, which, became, a, militant, organization, with, an, extreme, shiite, ideology, led, by, sheikh, haydar, ya, qub, initially, sent, sheikh, haydar, and, his, followers, to, a, holy, war, against, the, circassians, but, soon, decided, to, break, the, alliance, because, he, feared, the, military, power, of, sheikh, haydar, and, his, order, during, his, march, to, georgia, sheikh, haydar, attacked, one, of, ya, qub, s, vassals, the, shirvanshahs, in, revenge, for, his, father, sheikh, junayd, assassinated, in, 1460, and, ya, qub, sent, troops, to, the, shirvanshahs, who, defeated, and, killed, haydar, and, captured, his, three, sons, this, event, further, strengthened, the, pro, safavid, feeling, among, azerbaijani, and, anatolian, turkmen, following, ya, qub, s, death, civil, war, again, erupted, the, aq,
