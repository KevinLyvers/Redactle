a, time, of, great, progress, within, the, arts, and, sciences, a, renewed, interest, in, ancient, greek, and, roman, led, to, the, italian, renaissance, a, cultural, movement, that, profoundly,

geographical, exploration, along, the, coast, of, africa, in, search, of, a, maritime, route, to, india, followed, by, spain, near, the, close, of, the, 15th, century, dividing, their, exploration, of, the, world, according, to, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, in, 1494, they, were, the, first, states, to, set, up, colonies, in, america, and, european, trading, posts, factories, along, the, shores,

followed, by, france, england, and, the, netherlands, who, explored, the, portuguese, and, spanish, trade, routes, into, the, pacific, ocean, reaching, australia, in, 1606, and, new, zealand, in, 1642, with, the, development, of, the, printing, press, new, ideas, spread, throughout, europe, and, challenged, traditional, doctrines, in, science, and, theology, simultaneously, the, reformation, under, german, martin, luther, questioned, papal, authority, the, most, common, dating, of, the, reformation, begins, in, 1517, when, luther, published, the, ninety, five, theses, and, concludes, in, 1648, with, the, treaty, of, westphalia, that, ended, years, of, european, religious, wars, during, this, period, corruption, in, the, catholic, church, led, to, a, sharp, backlash, in, the, protestant, reformation, it, gained, many, followers, especially, among, princes, and, kings, seeking, a, stronger, state, by, ending, the, influence, of, the, catholic, church, figures, other, than, martin, luther, began, to, emerge, as, well, like, john, calvin, whose, calvinism, had, influence, in, many, countries, and, king, henry, viii, of, england, who, broke, away, from, the, catholic, church, in, england, and, set, up, the, anglican, church, these, religious, divisions, brought, on, a, wave, of, wars, inspired, and, driven, by, religion, but, also, by, the, ambitious, monarchs, in, western, europe, who, were, becoming, more, centralized, and, powerful, the, protestant, reformation, also, led, to, a, strong, reform, movement, in, the, catholic, church, called, the, counter, reformation, which, aimed, to, reduce, corruption, as, well, as, to, improve, and, strengthen, catholic, dogma, two, important, groups, in, the, catholic, church, who, emerged, from, this, movement, were, the, jesuits, who, helped, keep, spain, portugal, poland, and, other, european, countries, within, the, catholic, fold, and, the, oratorians, of, saint, philip, neri, who, ministered, to, the, faithful, in, rome, restoring, their, confidence, in, the, church, of, jesus, christ, that, subsisted, substantially, in, the, church, of, rome, still, the, catholic, church, was, somewhat, weakened, by, the, reformation, portions, of, europe, were, no, longer, under, its, sway, and, kings, in, the, remaining, catholic, countries, began, to, take, control, of, the, church, institutions, within, their, kingdoms, unlike, many, european, countries, at, the, time, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, was, notably, tolerant, of, the, protestant, movement, a, degree, of, tolerance, was, also, displayed, in, ottoman, hungary, particularly, in, the, semi, independent, principality, of, transylvania, while, still, enforcing, the, predominance, of, catholicism, they, continued, to, allow, the, large, religious, minorities, to, maintain, their, faiths, traditions, and, customs, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, became, divided, among, catholics, protestants, orthodox, jews, and, a, small, muslim, population, another, development, was, the, idea, of, european, superiority, there, was, a, movement, by, some, such, as, montaigne, that, regarded, the, non, europeans, as, a, better, more, natural, and, primitive, people, post, services, were, founded, all, over, europe, which, allowed, a, humanistic, interconnected, network, of, intellectuals, across, europe, despite, religious, divisions, however, the, roman, catholic, church, banned, many, leading, scientific, works, this, led, to, an, intellectual, advantage, for, protestant, countries, where, the, banning, of, books, was, regionally, organised, francis, bacon, and, other, advocates, of, science, tried, to, create, unity, in, europe, by, focusing, on, the, unity, in, nature, 1, in, the, 15th, century, at, the, end, of,

the, main, issue, was, whether, france, under, king, louis, xiv, would, take, control, of, spain, s, very, extensive, possessions, and, thereby, become, by, far, the, dominant, power, or, be, forced, to, share, power, with, other, major, nations, after, initial, allied, successes, the, long, war, produced, a, military, stalemate, and, ended, with, the, treaty, of, utrecht, which, was, based, on,

emphasizing, the, power, of, reason, rather, than, tradition, it, was, especially, favourable, to, science, especially, isaac, newton, s, physics, and, hostile, to, religious, orthodoxy, especially, of, the, catholic, church, it, sought, to, analyze, and, reform, society, using, reason, to, challenge, ideas, grounded, in, tradition, and, faith, and, to, advance, knowledge, through, the,

scientific, revolution, is, closely, tied, to, the, enlightenment, as, its, discoveries, overturned, many, traditional, concepts, and, introduced, new, perspectives, on, nature, and, man, s, place, within, it, the, enlightenment, flourished, until, about, 1790, 1800, at, which, point, the, enlightenment, with, its, emphasis, on, reason, gave, way, to, romanticism, which, placed, a, new, emphasis, on, emotion, a, counter, enlightenment, began, to, increase, in, prominence, in, france, enlightenment, was, based, in, the, salons, and, culminated, in, the, great, encyclop, die, 1751, 72, these, new, intellectual, strains, would, spread, to, urban, centres, across, europe, notably, england, scotland, the, german, states, the, netherlands, poland, russia, italy, austria, and, spain, as,

every, country, in, europe, the, great, enemy, of, freemasonry, was, the, roman, catholic, church, so, that, in, countries, with, a, large, catholic, element, such, as, france, italy, austria, spain, and, mexico, much, of, the, ferocity, of, the, political, battles, involve, the, confrontation, between, supporters, of, the, church, versus, active, masons, 20th, century, totalitarian, and,

advancements, most, notably, the, utilization, of, the, steam, engine, were, major, catalysts, in, the, industrialisation, process, it, started, in, england, and, scotland, in, the, mid, 18th, century, with, the, mechanisation, of, the, textile, industries, the, development, of, iron, making, techniques, and, the, increased, use, of, coal, as, the, main, fuel, trade, expansion, was, enabled, by, the, introduction, of, canals, improved, roads, and, railways, the, introduction, of, steam, power, fuelled, primarily, by, coal, and, powered, machinery, mainly, in, textile, manufacturing, underpinned, the, dramatic, increases, in, production, capacity, the, development, of, all, metal, machine, tools, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 19th, century, facilitated, the, manufacture, of, more, production, machines, for, manufacturing, in, other, industries, the, effects, spread, throughout, western, europe, and, north, america, during, the, 19th, century, eventually, affecting, most, of, the, world, historians, r, r, palmer, and, joel, colton, argue, the, era, of, the, french, revolution, and, the, subsequent, napoleonic, wars, was, a, difficult, time,

form, of, government, that, attracted, worldwide, attention, the, french, revolution, 1789, 1804, was, a, product, of, the, same, democratic, forces, in, the, atlantic, world, and, had, an, even, greater, impact, french, historian, fran, ois, aulard, says, french, intervention, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, had, nearly, bankrupted, the, state, after, repeated, failed, attempts, at,

run, out, of, manpower, germany, s, allies, austria, hungary, and, the, ottoman, empire, surrendered, and, dissolved, followed, by, germany, on, 11, november, 1918, the, world, war, was, settled, by, the, victors, at, the, paris, peace, conference, 1919, the, major, decisions, were, the, creation, of, the, league, of, nations, peace, treaties, with, defeated, enemies, most, notably, the, treaty, of, versailles, with, germany, the, awarding, of, german, and, ottoman, overseas, possessions, as, mandates, chiefly, to, britain, and, france, and, the, drawing, of, new, national, boundaries, to, better, reflect, the, forces, of, nationalism, multiple, nations, were, required, to, sign, minority, rights, treaties, the, treaty, of, versailles, itself, weakened, germany, s, military, power, and, placed, full, blame, for, the, war, and, costly, reparations, on, its, shoulders, the, humiliation, and, resentment, in, germany, was, probably, one, of, the, causes, of, nazi, success, and, indirectly, a, cause, of, world, war, ii, in, the, treaty, of, versailles, 1919, the, winners, recognised, the, new, states, poland, czechoslovakia, hungary, austria, yugoslavia, finland, estonia, latvia, lithuania, created, in, central, europe, from, the, defunct, german, austro, hungarian, and, russian, empires, based, on, national, ethnic, self, determination, it, was, a, peaceful, era, with, a, few, small, wars, before, 1922, such, as, the, ukrainian, soviet, war, 1917, 1921, and, the, polish, soviet, war, 1919, 1921, prosperity, was, widespread, and, the, major, cities, sponsored, a, youth, culture, called, the, roaring, twenties, or, jazz, age, the, allied, victory, in, the, first, world, war, seemed, to, mark, the, triumph, of, liberalism, historian, martin, blinkhorn, argues, that, the, liberal, themes, were, ascendant, in, terms, of, cultural, pluralism, religious, and, ethnic, toleration, national, self, determination, free, market, economics, representative, and, responsible, government, free, trade, unionism, and, the, peaceful, settlement, of, international, disputes, through, a, new, body, the, league, of, nations, however, as, early, as, 1917, the, emerging, liberal, order, was, being, challenged, by, the, new, communist, movement, communist, revolts, were, beaten, back, everywhere, else, but, succeeded, in, russia, italy, adopted, an, authoritarian, dictatorship, known, as, fascism, in, 1922, authoritarian, regimes, replaced, democracy, in, the, 1930s, in, nazi, germany, portugal, austria, poland, greece, the, baltic, countries, and, francoist, spain, by, 1940, there, were, only, four, liberal, democracies, left, on, the, european, continent, france, finland, switzerland, and, sweden, after, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, most, of, the, world, sank, into, a, great, depression, prices, and, profits, fell, and, unemployment, soared, the, worst, hit, sectors, included, heavy, industry, export, oriented, agriculture, mining, and, lumbering, and, construction, world, trade, fell, by, two, thirds, in, most, of, europe, many, nations, turned, to, dictators, and, authoritarian, regimes, the, most, momentous, change, of, government, came, when, hitler, took, power, in, germany, in, 1933, the, main, institution, that, was, meant, to, bring, stability, was, the, league, of, nations, created, in, 1919, however, the, league, failed, to, resolve, any, major, crises, undermined, by, the, bellicosity, of, nazi, germany, imperial, japan, the, soviet, union, and, mussolini, s, italy, and, by, the, non, participation, of, the, united, states, by, 1937, it, was, largely, ignored, italy, conquered, ethiopia, in, 1931, the, spanish, civil, war, 1936, 1939, was, won, by, the, rebels, the, nationalist, faction, led, by, francisco, franco, the, civil, war, did, not, escalate, into, a, larger, conflict, but, did, become, a, worldwide, ideological, battleground, that, pitted, the, left, the, communist, movement, and, many, liberals, against, catholics, conservatives, and, fascists, britain, france, and, the, us, remained, neutral, worldwide, there, was, a, decline, in, pacifism, and, a, growing, sense, that, another, world, war, was, imminent, in, 1938, adolf, hitler, annexed, the, sudetenland, in, the, munich, agreement, britain, and, france, adopted, a, policy, of, appeasement, but, germany, subsequently, took, over, the, rest, of, czechoslovakia, after, allying, with, japan, in, the, anti, comintern, pact, and, then, also, with, benito, mussolini, s, italy, in, the, pact, of, steel, and, finally, signing, a, non, aggression, treaty, with, the, soviet, union, in, august, 1939, hitler, launched, the, second, world, war, on, 1, september, 1939, by, attacking, poland, britain, and, france, declared, war, on, germany, but, there, was, little, fighting, during, the, phoney, war, period, war, began, in, earnest, in, spring, 1940, with, the, successful, blitzkrieg, conquests, of, denmark, norway, the, low, countries, and, france, britain, defeated, germany, s, air, attacks, in, the, battle, of, britain, hitler, s, goal, was, to, control, eastern, europe, but, the, attack, on, the, soviet, union, was, delayed, until, june, 1941, and, the, wehrmacht, was, stopped, close, to, moscow, in, december, 1941, over, the, next, year, the, germans, started, to, suffer, a, series, of,

the, red, army, conquered, the, reichstag, in, the, battle, of, berlin, hitler, committed, suicide, and, germany, surrendered, world, war, ii, was, the, deadliest, conflict, in, human, history, causing, between, 50, and, 80, million, deaths, the, majority, of, whom, were, civilians, approximately, 38, to, 55, million, this, period, was, also, marked, by, systematic, genocide, in, 1942, 45,

dominant, in, the, west, most, historians, point, to, its, success, as, the, product, of, exhaustion, with, war, and, dictatorship, and, the, promise, of, continued, economic, prosperity, the, united, states, gave, away, about, 20, billion, in, marshall, plan, grants, and, other, funding, to, western, europe, 1945, to, 1951, historian, michael, j, hogan, argues, that, american, aid, was, critical, in, stabilizing, the, economy, and, politics, of, western, europe, it, brought, in, modern, management, that, dramatically, increased, productivity, and, encouraged, cooperation, between, labor, and, management, and, among, states, local, communist, parties, were, opposed, and, they, lost, prestige, and, influence, and, a, role, in, government, in, strategic, terms, says, hogan, the, marshall, plan, strengthened, the, west, against, the, possibility, of, a, communist, invasion, or, political, takeover, however, the, marshall, plan, s, role, in, the, rapid, recovery, has, been, debated, most, reject, the, idea, that, it, only, miraculously, revived, europe, since, the, evidence, shows, that, a, general, recovery, was, already, under, way, economic, historians, bradford, de, long, and, barry, eichengreen, conclude, the, soviet, union, concentrated, on, its, own, recovery, it, seized, and, transferred, most, of, germany, s, industrial, plants, and, it, exacted, war, reparations,
