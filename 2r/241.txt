escape, from, transoxiana, initially, the, seljuks, took, refuge, in, khwarazm, which, served, as, one, of, their, traditional, pastures, but, they, were, also, encouraged, by, the, local, ghaznavid, governor, harun, who, hoped, to, utilise, seljuks, for, his, efforts, to, seize, khorasan, from, his, sovereign, when, harun, was, assassinated, by, ghaznavid, agents, in, 1035, they, again, had, to, flee, this, time, heading, south, across, the, karakum, desert, first, they, made, their, way, to, the, important, city, of, merv, but, perhaps, due, to, its, strong, fortification, they, changed, their, route, westwards, to, take, refuge, in, nasa, finally, the, seljuks, arrived, on, the, edges, of, khorasan, the, province, considered, a, jewel, in, the, ghaznavid, crown, after, moving, into, khorasan, seljuks, under, tughril, wrested, an, empire, from, the, ghaznavids, initially, the, seljuks, were, repulsed, by, mahmud, and, retired, to, khwarezm, but, tughril, and, chaghri, led, them,

perso, islamic, tradition, was, based, on, pre, islamic, iranian, ideas, of, kingship, molded, into, an, islamic, framework, little, of, the, public, symbolism, used, by, the, seljuks, was, turkic,

persian, was, also, used, for, books, lecturing, about, politics, in, the, mirrors, for, princes, genre, such, as, the, prominent, siyasatnama, book, of, politics, composed, by, nizam, al, mulk, during, this, period, these, type, of, books, consciously, made, use, of, islamic, and, iranian, traditions, such, as, an, ideal, government, based, on, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, and, his, successors, or, the, sasanian, king, of, kings, khosrow, i, r, 531, 579, in, most, of, their, coins, the, seljuk, sultans, used, the, sasanian, title, of, shahanshah, king, of, kings, and, even, used, the, old, buyid, title, of, shahanshah, of, islam, the, title, of, malik, was, used, by, lesser, princes, of, the, seljuk, family, like, the, caliphate, the, seljuks, relied, on, a, refined, persian, bureaucracy, the, settlement, of, turkic, tribes, in, the, northwestern, peripheral, parts, of, the, empire, for, the, strategic, military, purpose, of, fending, off, invasions, from, neighboring, states, led, to, the, progressive, turkicization, of, those, areas, according, to, the, 12th, century, poet, nizami, aruzi, all, of, the, seljuk, sultans, had, a, liking, for, poetry, which, is, also, demonstrated, by, the, large, compilation, of, persian, verses, written, under, their, patronage, this, had, already, started, under, tughril, who, was, praised, in, arabic, and, persian, by, poets, such, as, fakhruddin, as, ad, gurgani, and, bakharzi, albeit, he, could, not, understand, the, verses, the, last, seljuk, sultan, tughril, iii, was, well, known, for, his, persian, poetry, the, saljuq, nama, of, zahir, al, din, nishapuri, which, was, most, likely, dedicated, to, tughril, iii, indicates, that, the, seljuk, family, now, used, persian, to, communicate, and, even, were, taught, about, the, achievements, of, their, forefathers, in, that, language, tughril, relied, on, his, vizier, to, translate, from, arabic, and, persian, into, turkic, for, him, and, oghuz, songs, were, sung, at, the, wedding, of, tughril, to, the, caliph, s, daughter, later, sultans, like, mahmud, could, speak, arabic, alongside, persian, however, they, still, used, turkic, among, themselves, the, most, significant, evidence, of, the, importance, of, turkic, language, is, the, extensive, turkic, arabic, dictionary, or, the, d, w, n, lugh, t, al, turk, assembled, in, baghdad, for, caliph, al, muqtadi, by, mahmud, al, kashgari, however, besides, the, diwan, no, works, written, in, turkic, language, survive, from, the, seljuk, empire, while, the, maliknama, was, compiled, from, turkic, oral, accounts, it, was, written, in, persian, and, arabic, languages, steppe, traditions, influenced, seljuk, marriages, with, tughril, marrying, his, brother, chaghri, s, widow, a, practice, despised, in, islam, seljuk, ceremonies, were, based, on, the, abbasid, model, but, sometimes, ancient, iranian, ceremonies, were, observed, during, a, night, in, 1091, all, of, baghdad, was, lit, with, candles, under, the, orders, of, malik, shah, i, which, resembled, the, zoroastrian, ritual, of, sadhak, in, 985, the, seljuks, migrated, to, the, city, of, jend, where, they, converted, to, islam, the, arrival, of, the, seljuk, turks, into, persia, and, their, patronage, of, constructing, madrasas, allowed, for, sunni, islam, to, become, the, dominant, sect, of, islam, until, the, death, of, sultan, sanjar, the, seljuks, were, pious, sunnis, and, represented, a, re, establishment, of, sunni, islam, in, iraq, and, western, persia, since, the, 10th, century, in, 1046, tughril, built, the, madrasa, al, sultaniya, in, nishapur, while, chaghri, beg, founded, a, madrasa, in, merv, tughril, and, alp, arslan, chose, hanafi, qadis, and, preachers, for, these, madrasas, by, 1063, there, were, twenty, five, madrasas, scattered, throughout, persia, and, khorasan, founded, by, seljuk, princes, in, the, 12th, century, there, were, over, thirty, madrasas, in, baghdad, in, 1056, tughril, built, a, friday, mosque, with, a, newly, constructed, quarter, in, baghdad, which, was, surrounded, by, a, wall, the, new, quarter, separated, the, shia, community, from, the, sunnis, since, there, had, been, frequent, outbreaks, of, violence, through, the, influence, of, tughril, s, vizier, al, kunduri, a, hanafi, sunni, the, ash, ari, and, ismaili, shi, ites, were, exiled, from, khurasan, and, cursed, at, friday, sermons, in, seljuk, mosques, al, kunduri, s, vizierate, persecuted, ash, aris, and, sharifis, although, this, ended, with, the, vizierate, of, nizam, al, mulk, it, was, under, the, vizierate, of, al, kunduri, that, the, islamic, scholar, al, juwayni, was, forced, to, flee, to, mecca, and, medina, in, 1065, alp, arslan, campaigned, against, the, kingdom, of, georgia, subjugated, tbilisi, and, built, a, mosque, in, the, city, in, 1092, malik, shah, built, the, jami, al, sultan, mosque, in, baghdad, at, the, capital, isfahan, malik, shah, had, constructed, a, madrasa, a, citadel, and, a, castle, near, dizkuh, following, malik, shah, s, death, the, familial, civil, war, drew, attention, away, from, religious, patronage, slowing, the, building, of, madrasas, and, mosques, although, in, 1130, the, seljuk, sultan, sanjar, ordered, the, construction, of, the, quthamiyya, madrasa, in, samarkand, while, the, seljuk, sultans, were, prodigious, builders, of, religious, buildings, seljuk, viziers, were, no, different, the, seljuk, vizier, nazim, al, mulk, founded, the, first, madrasa, in, baghdad, in, 1063, called, the, nizamiya, in, the, madrasas, he, built, he, patronized, shafi, is, the, vizier, taj, al, mulk, and, malik, shah, s, widow, terken, khatun, patronized, the, building, of, a, madrasa, to, compete, with, nazim, s, nizamiya, the, region, of, iraq, was, under, the, control, of, the, seljuk, empire, from, 1055, to, 1135, since, the, oghuz, turk, tughril, beg, had, expelled, the, shiite, buyid, dynasty, tughril, beg, entered, baghdad, in, 1055, and, was, the, first, seljuk, ruler, to, style, himself, sultan, and, protector, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, from, that, time, the, abassids, were, only, puppets, in, the, hands, of, the, seljuks, in, 1058, the, abassid, caliph, granted, to, tughril, the, title, of, king, of, east, and, west, officially, becoming, the, temporal, protector, of, abassid, caliph, qa, im, iraq, remained, under, the, control, of, the, great, seljuks, during, the, reign, of, muhammad, i, tapar, 1082, 1118, ce, but, from, 1119, his, 14, years, old, son, mahmud, ii, 1118, 1131, was, restricted, to, the, only, rule, of, iraq, while, sanjar, took, control, of, the, rest, of, the, empire, in, order, to, counter, the, ambitions, of, abbasid, caliph, al, mustarshid, 1118, 1135, who, wanted, to, acquire, world, dominance, in, 1124, mahm, d, granted, the, city, of, wasit, to, imad, al, din, zengi, as, an, qta, and, conferred, him, the, military, governorship, of, basra, together, with, baghdad, and, the, whole, of, iraq, in, 1126, in, 1127, imad, al, din, zengi, was, named, governor, of, mosul, where, the, atabegdom, of, mosul, was, formed, the, seljuk, control, of, the, abassids, ended, in, 1135, with, direct, military, confrontation, between, the, abassids, and, the, seljuks, after, rebuilding, the, walls, of, baghdad, and, recreating, a, caliphal, after, many, centuries, al, mustarshid, confronted, the, subordinate, seljuk, sultan, of, iraq, mas, ud, in, battle, the, caliph, lost, and, was, taken, prisoner, and, died, in, captivity, in, 1135, but, conflicts, continued, with, al, mustarshid, s, successors, mas, ud, briefly, recaptured, baghdad, in, the, siege, of, baghdad, 1136, forcing, caliph, al, rashid, billah, to, abdicate, but, the, next, caliph, al, muqtafi, 1136, 1160, managed, to, restore, a, high, degree, of, independence, and, successfully, resisted, the, seljuk, siege, of, baghdad, 1157, the, army, of, the, earliest, seljuks, was, not, similar, to, the, renowned, turkic, military, of, the, classical, abbasid, era, their, first, invasions, were, more, of, a, great, nomadic, migration, accompanied, by, their, families, and, livestock, rather, than, planned, military, conquests, they, were, not, a, professional, army, however, warfare, was, a, way, of, life, for, nearly, all, of, adult, male, turkmens, according, to, a, seljuk, vizier, nizam, al, mulk, by, the, reign, of, malik, shah, i, the, sovereign, had, a, large, army, at, his, disposal, there, were, turkmens, mamluks, a, standing, army, infantry, and, the, sultan, s, personal, guard, nizam, al, mulk, also, estimated, malik, shah, s, forces, at, 400, 000, men, and, often, opposed, cost, cutting, plans, instituted, by, taj, al, mulk, to, bring, these, to, 70, 000, vizier, nizam, al, mulk, the, greatest, advocate, of, iranian, orientation, for, the, seljuk, empire, admitted, the, debt, dynasty, owed, to, the, turkmens, after, the, establishment, of, the, seljuk, state, turkmens, continued, to, be, the, driving, force, behind, the, seljuk, expansion, in, anatolia, after, the, rule, of, malik, shah, i, however, there, are, very, few, mentions, of, turkmens, in, the, jibali, region, of, the, state, especially, in, their, traditional, axis, of, rayy, hamadhan, and, hulwan, turkmens, were, difficult, to, manage, and, they, were, susceptible, to, undisciplined, pillaging, the, greatest, issue, however, was, their, dependence, on, pasturelands, for, their, livestock, a, great, number, of, regions, that, constituted, the, seljuk, state, were, ecologically, ill, suited, for, supporting, a, nomadic, army, turkmens, limitations, are, adeptly, described, by, arab, scholar, sibt, ibn, al, jawzi, the, sultan, tughril, i, ordered, his, soldiers, to, prepare, and, to, send, to, bring, their, tents, children, and, families, to, iraq, and, to, head, to, syria, with, him, they, said, this, land, is, ruined, there, is, neither, food, nor, fodder, here, and, we, have, no, funds, left, we, cannot, stay, on, the, backs, of, horses, what, if, our, families, horses, and, beasts, come, but, our, absence, becomes, drawn, out, we, must, visit, our, families, so, we, are, asking, for, permission, to, return, to, them, and, to, go, back, to, the, place, which, is, assigned, to, us, long, campaigns, had, to, be, discontinued, due, to, turkmens, insistence, on, returning, home, and, conquests, had, to, be, scheduled, to, satisfy, the, demands, of, turkmens, the, short, term, needs, of, turkmens, made, a, longer, term, military, plans, unachievable, the, alternative, to, nomadic, turkmen, troops, was, mamluks, while, also, of, turkic, and, often, nomadic, origin, dependence, on, pasturelands, was, non, existent, for, mamluks, as, they, did, not, live, a, nomadic, life, previously, mamluks, had, constituted, the, later, abbasid, the, samanid, and, the, ghaznavid, armies, in, fact, the, ghaznavid, dynasty, was, itself, of, mamluk, origin, the, process, of, mamluk, recruitment, are, well, known, from, other, periods, in, islamic, history, but, there, is, almost, no, information, directly, relating, to, the, seljuks, the, chief, source, of, mamluks, was, most, probably, forays, to, the, steppe, the, alternative, to, raids, was, buying, them, from, slave, traders, and, various, dealers, as, evidenced, from, a, slave, dispute, between, a, merchant, and, muhammad, i, tapar, many, depictions, of, military, figures, are, known, from, the, period, immediately, following, the, seljuk, empire, which, ended, in, 1194, as, illustrated, manuscripts, started, to, enjoy, a, major, boom, from, circa, 1200, seljuk, styles, of, military, equipment, continued, during, the, 13th, century, in, the, turkic, post, seljuk, successor, states, generally, included, under, the, term, seljuk, period, such, as, the, seljuk, rums, the, zengids, the, artuqids, or, the, khwarizmians, and, are, documented, in, their, manuscripts, mosques, and, madrasas, were, created, and, embellished, during, the, period, of, seljuk, control, congregational, mosques, were, either, repaired, re, built, or, constructed, in, their, entirety, the, seljuk, sultan, also, commissioned, numerous, madrasas, to, promote, the, teaching, of, orthodox, islamic, sciences, these, developments, in, architectural, practice, are, coherent, with, the, seljuk, dynasty, s, focus, on, islam, and, the, promotion, of, muslim, orthodoxy, the, combining, of, sufism, and, sunnism, overall, the, architecture, attributed, to, the, seljuk, period, is, characterized, by, elaborate, decoration, much, like, the, other, arts, produced, under, seljuk, rule, decoration, was, primarily, executed, in, elaborate, brickwork, and, in, the, use, of, colorful, glazed, tiles, the, most, important, innovations, of, this, period, occurred, in, the, form, of, mosques, as, first, seen, in, the, renovations, of, the, friday, mosque, of, isfahan, one, was, the, introduction, of, the, four, iwan, plan, this, was, attested, in, some, earlier, buildings, but, under, the, seljuks, it, turned, into, a, common, characteristic, of, mosques, madrasas, and, caravanserais, in, iran, and, central, asia, eventually, influencing, architecture, in, syria, mesopotamia, and, anatolia, as, well, another, major, innovation, was, the, creation, of, monumental, domes, over, the, space, in, front, of, the, mihrab, or, the, maqsura, which, also, became, characteristic, of, later, mosques, in, this, region, and, beyond, another, architectural, form, that, flourished, during, the, seljuk, period, was, the, muqarnas, a, form, of, three, dimensional, geometric, decoration, some, interpretations, maintain, that, the, earliest, known, examples, of, muqarnas, were, constructed, during, the, period, of, seljuk, hegemony, though, it, also, remains, possible, that, they, were, being, developed, at, the, same, time, in, north, africa, the, layering, of, multiple, embellished, cells, with, divergent, profiles, in, muqarnas, creates, a, dome, that, has, a, seemingly, insubstantial, interior, the, play, of, light, on, the, surface, enhances, this, visual, effect, art, historian, oleg, grabar, argues, that, the, effect, of, muqarnas, domes, embodies, qur, anic, water, symbolism, examples, of, muqarnas, also, appear, in, the, niches, of, mosques, built, during, the, seljuk, empire, various, art, forms, were, popularized, during, the, seljuk, period, as, evidenced, by, the, vast, amount, of, surviving, artifacts, most, seljuk, arts, are, known, to, have, been, produced, in, what, is, modern, day, iran, however, the, seljuk, sultans, also, encouraged, artists, to, settle, in, anatolia, as, part, of, a, recolonization, and, reconstruction, process, of, several, cities, many, works, of, seljuk, art, continued, to, be, produced, following, the, decline, of, the, empire, in, the, late, 12th, century, in, this, regard, the, timeline, associated, with, the, production, of, seljuk, art, does, not, entirely, match, the, political, events, pertaining, to, the, empire, and, its, eventual, fall, nonetheless, relatively, little, art, can, be, correctly, dated, and, ascribed, to, a, great, seljuk, context, much, of, the, material, deemed, to, be, seljuk, in, world, museums, in, fact, belongs, to, the, period, a, d, 1150, 1250, after, the, fall, of, the, great, seljuk, empire, when, there, seems, to, have, been, a, sudden, burst, in, artistic, production, apparently, to, a, great, extent, unrelated, to, court, patronage, among, other, ceramics, the, manufacture, of, polychrome, ceramic, tiles, often, used, as, decor, in, architecture, were, popularized, during, the, seljuk, dynasty, the, seljuks, pioneered, the, use, of, the, mina, i, technique, a, painted, and, enameled, polychrome, overglaze, for, ceramics, the, glazes, on, the, seljuk, ceramics, produced, often, ranged, from, a, brilliant, turquoise, to, a, very, dark, blue, the, art, of, seljuk, mosaic, tile, decorating, would, continue, to, dominate, the, interior, of, many, anatolian, mosques, following, the, period, of, seljuk, rule, the, seljuks, also, created, ceramic, house, models, while, other, ceramic, forms, in, the, seljuk, period, included, pottery, figurines, some, of, them, children, s, toys, both, secular, and, non, secular, manuscripts, were, produced, during, the, seljuk, period, these, pieces, are, now, limited, in, availability, considering, their, ultimate, susceptibility, to, damage, overtime, but, those, manuscripts, that, have, survived, over, the, centuries, provide, insight, into, the, seljuk, s, involvement, in, the, arts, of, the, book, calligraphers, and, illuminators, were, responsible, for, the, creation, of, these, manuscripts, though, sometimes, calligraphers, mastered, the, art, of, both, writing, and, illustration, by, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, both, illuminators, and, calligraphers, were, beginning, to, employ, various, colors, styles, and, writing, techniques, in, the, realm, of, the, book, arts, the, qur, an, s, produced, during, the, period, of, seljuk, rule, evidence, developments, in, calligraphy, and, other, changes, in, how, the, holy, text, was, divided, uniquely, calligraphers, during, this, period, frequently, combined, several, scripts, on, one, page, of, the, qur, an, such, as, kufic, and, new, style, in, addition, to, these, changes, in, the, text, the, dawn, of, the, seljuk, empire, coincided, with, a, newfound, increase, in, the, popularity, of, paper, as, a, replacement, for, parchment, in, the, islamic, world, the, use, of, durable, paper, increased, the, production, of, compact, single, volume, qur, an, s, whereas, parchment, codexes, often, contained, multiple, volumes, of, qur, anic, text, despite, this, development, parchment, would, remain, popular, for, the, production, of, some, qur, an, s, and, multi, volume, pieces, continued, to, be, produced, illuminated, borders, continued, to, distinguish, the, qur, ans, produced, during, the, seljuk, period, and, relative, consistency, was, maintained, with, regard, to, their, structure, one, example, of, a, manuscript, created, during, seljuk, rule, is, a, thirty, volume, juz, qur, an, created, c, 1050, produced, by, only, one, calligrapher, and, illuminator, freer, gallery, of, art, district, of, columbia, f2001, 16a, b, as, paper, had, just, been, introduced, to, the, islamic, world, this, piece, is, an, early, islamic, paper, manuscript, this, qur, an, is, bound, in, brown, leather, dyed, in, pink, decorated, with, gold, and, offers, an, intricate, frontispiece, these, elements, imply, the, care, that, went, into, the, production, of, this, text, and, indications, of, frequent, usage, confirm, that, it, was, appreciated, it, is, primarily, written, in, the, vertical, new, style, arabic, script, a, sharp, vertical, script, the, dominant, use, of, new, style, in, this, folio, also, referred, to, as, new, abbasid, script, attests, to, the, shift, from, the, geometric, kufic, script, to, a, more, legible, calligraphic, style, which, occurred, in, the, 10th, century, scattered, remnants, of, kufic, used, primarily, to, indicate, volume, and, page, number, also, appear, in, the, text, the, verticality, of, the, paper, in, this, manuscript, speaks, to, the, historic, shift, away, from, the, horizontal, use, of, paper, in, many, qur, ans, also, a, 10th, century, development, another, example, of, a, religious, manuscript, produced, closer, to, the, end, of, the, period, of, seljuk, rule, is, the, qarmathian, qur, an, dispersed, folio, arthur, m, stackler, gallery, of, art, district, of, columbia, s1986, 65a, b, this, manuscript, s, folios, are, illuminated, with, a, gold, border, and, thin, spiraled, illustration, featuring, vegetal, motifs, despite, the, generous, illumination, the, four, lines, of, qur, anic, text, on, the, folio, are, exceptionally, legible, created, between, the, years, 1170, 1200, this, particular, folio, demonstrates, the, evolution, of, new, style, as, both, vocalized, cursive, and, diacritical, dots, appear, in, this, later, version, of, the, script, only, during, the, 13th, century, would, new, style, be, replaced, by, the, curvier, proportional, scripts, for, regular, use, a, final, example, of, a, seljuk, qur, an, that, has, entered, into, scholarship, is, a, manuscript, studied, in, depth, by, the, late, art, historian, richard, ettinghausen, this, piece, was, written, in, 1164, by, mahmud, ibn, al, husayn, and, contains, the, entirety, of, the, qur, an, university, of, pennsylvania, museum, of, archaeology, and, anthropology, philadelphia, nep27, unlike, the, two, seljuk, qur, ans, discussed, prior, this, manuscript, primarily, contains, naskh, script, another, early, arabic, script, that, replaced, kufic, however, some, kufic, calligraphy, is, embedded, in, the, chapter, headings, this, aspect, speaks, to, how, the, inclusion, of, kufic, in, qur, ans, became, more, of, a, decorative, element, overtime, often, included, in, headings, as, opposed, to, the, main, body, of, text, the, manuscript, is, large, with, seventeen, lines, of, text, per, two, hundred, and, fifteen, sheets, of, paper, though, not, all, of, the, qur, an, is, illuminated, both, the, beginning, and, the, end, boast, elaborate, illustration, with, blue, gold, and, white, hues, ettinghausen, describes, the, subsequent, visual, effect, as, brilliant, the, inscriptions, feature, detailed, rosettes, vines, medallions, and, arabesques, some, exclusively, as, decoration, and, others, to, indicate, the, end, of, particular, lines, of, qur, anic, text, manuscript, production, during, the, seljuk, period, was, not, limited, to, religious, texts, beyond, these, religious, manuscripts, scientific, literary, and, historical, pieces, were, created, one, example, of, a, secular, manuscript, is, the, nusrat, al, fatrah, a, historiographical, and, literary, account, of, the, seljuk, period, written, in, 1200, by, im, d, al, d, n, al, furqan, islamic, heritage, foundation, london, meanwhile, the, scientific, manuscripts, produced, during, the, seljuk, period, oftentimes, pertained, to, geography, physics, mechanics, mathematics, and, astronomy, the, former, seljuk, city, of, isfahan, not, only, boasted, twelve, libraries, that, contained, a, total, of, twelve, thousand, volumes, but, also, had, an, observatory, where, scholars, could, record, their, astrological, findings, secular, manuscripts, from, the, seljuk, empire, bear, illuminations, that, often, relate, to, the, alignment, of, planets, and, the, zodiac, a, couple, examples, of, common, themes, whether, secular, or, non, secular, seljuk, illuminated, manuscripts, had, enough, influence, as, to, inspire, other, relevant, art, forms, such, as, brass, or, bronze, metal, objects, for, example, the, large, qarmathian, qur, an, influenced, some, of, the, inscriptions, on, seljuk, ceramic, wares, even, mirrors, candlesticks, coins, and, jugs, manufactured, in, anatolia, during, the, seljuk, period, would, often, bear, occult, astrological, images, inspired, by, manuscripts, occult, knowledge, persisted, in, manuscripts, produced, after, the, decline, in, the, seljuk, s, political, power, in, the, late, 12th, century, as, the, seljuk, sultanate, s, influence, on, the, book, arts, continued, in, anatolia, historian, andrew, peacock, demonstrates, an, interest, in, the, seljuks, of, anatolia, s, focus, on, occult, themes, and, its, manifestation, in, the, book, arts, peacock, describes, this, finding, as, something, that, challenges, the, reigning, view, that, the, seljuks, were, exclusively, the, pious, defenders, of, islam, when, it, came, to, larger, systems, of, belief, some, of, the, occult, sciences, that, the, seljuks, took, special, interest, in, included, geomancy, astrology, alchemy, a, relevant, occult, manuscript, from, a, later, period, of, seljuk, influence, in, the, 13th, century, is, the, dustur, al, munajjimin, otherwise, known, as, the, rules, of, astrologers, while, another, is, the, daqa, iq, al, haqa, iq, or, the, fine, points, of, eternal, truths, dating, to, the, sultanate, of, rum, in, 1272, the, latter, text, captures, an, interest, in, magic, and, spells, with, a, particular, focus, on, calling, upon, spiritual, beings, such, as, angels, through, ritualistic, acts, biblioth, que, nationale, de, france, paris, persan, 174, the, text, was, written, by, a, man, who, wrote, under, a, pen, name, nasiri, interestingly, nasiri, s, daqa, iq, al, haqa, iq, challenges, prevailing, islamic, understandings, of, god, while, encouraging, piety, and, invoking, both, sufi, terms, and, themes, for, example, while, incorporating, a, sufi, poem, the, occult, text, speaks, of, supernatural, bodies, and, disputes, what, islam, considers, to, be, the, accepted, number, of, names, for, god, the, western, area, of, the, seljuk, realm, including, syria, jazira, and, iraq, saw, an, explosion, of, figural, art, from, the, 12th, to, 13th, centuries, particularly, in, the, areas, of, decorative, art, and, illustrated, manuscripts, this, occurred, despite, religious, condemnations, against, the, depiction, of, living, creatures, on, the, grounds, that, it, implies, a, likeness, to, the, creative, activity, of, god, the, origins, of, this, new, pictorial, tradition, are, uncertain, but, arabic, illustrated, manuscripts, such, as, the, maqamat, al, hariri, shared, many, characteristics, with, christian, syriac, illustrated, manuscripts, such, as, syriac, gospels, british, library, add, 7170, this, synthesis, seems, to, point, to, a, common, pictorial, tradition, which, developed, from, circa, 1180, ce, in, the, region, which, was, highly, influenced, by, byzantine, art, starting, around, the, middle, of, the, 12th, century, there, appears, to, have, been, a, major, increase, in, the, number, of, artistic, metalwork, objects, produced, in, the, eastern, islamic, world, roughly, iran, and, central, asia, more, of, these, objects, have, survived, from, after, the, 1140s, than, from, before, this, period, the, major, centers, of, production, were, initially, concentrated, in, the, khorasan, region, including, nishapur, herat, and, ghazna, there, is, some, scholarly, debate, about, the, patronage, of, these, objects, with, some, suggesting, that, the, growth, in, production, is, explainable, by, the, growth, of, a, bourgeoisie, in, khorasan, which, had, the, means, to, afford, such, costly, craftsmanship, this, is, attested, in, part, by, inscriptions, naming, merchant, owners, but, most, surviving, objects, are, nonetheless, attributed, by, their, inscriptions, to, sultans, royal, household, members, or, state, officials, in, the, early, 13th, century, this, expansion, of, metalwork, art, and, patronage, also, occurred, further, west, in, the, levant, and, mesopotamia, under, the, successors, of, the, great, seljuks, the, zengids, the, artuqids, and, the, anatolian, seljuks, spurred, in, part, by, the, immigration, of, metalworkers, from, iran, made, of, bronze, or, brass, objects, could, also, be, inlaid, with, copper, and, silver, this, latter, technique, had, fallen, out, of, fashion, in, previous, centuries, but, it, underwent, a, revival, that, probably, originated, in, khorasan, during, this, period, the, forms, produced, include, both, traditional, khorasani, types, such, as, fluted, ewers, and, hooded, incense, burners, and, newe, shapes, such, as, penboxes, with, rounded, ends, and, candlesticks, with, drum, like, bodies, many, metal, vessels, also, featured, zoomorphic, forms, the, most, sophisticated, works, were, created, by, raising, and, sinking, with, decoration, executed, in, repouss, to, create, some, shapes, multiple, metal, sheets, were, carefully, soldered, together, with, the, seams, made, invisible, by, various, means, such, as, by, camouflaging, them, under, decorative, friezes, the, wide, range, of, ornamental, motifs, include, arabesques, geometric, designs, real, and, mythological, animals, and, even, scenes, of, human, figures, such, as, musicians, and, horsemen, arabic, inscriptions, are, found, on, almost, all, metalwork, art, objects, an, innovation, of, this, period, almost, exclusive, to, metalwork, is, the, rendering, of, arabic, script, into, figurative, forms, the, earliest, example, of, this, is, found, on, the, so, called, bobrinsky, bucket, the, general, clothing, style, attributed, to, the, seljuks, is, that, of, the, aqbiya, turkiyya, or, long, robe, or, decorated, caftan, with, turkish, cut, with, a, front, opening, closing, diagonally, from, right, to, left, patterned, textiles, were, used, together, with, tiraz, bands, on, the, upper, sleeves, clothing, included, tall, boots, as, well, as, various, hats, of, the, sharbush, type, often, including, a, fur, lining, these, styles, continued, during, the, 13th, century, in, the, smaller, turkic, successor, states, such, as, the, zengids, or, artuqids, where, many, more, illustrations, are, available, especially, in, manuscripts, on, the, other, hand, the, affluent, sedentary, persian, population, seems, to, have, adopted, different, robe, styles, with, a, front, opening, closing, diagonally, from, left, to, right, called, the, aqbiya, tatariyya, or, tatar, style, but, actually, also, characteristic, of, persian, caftans, from, the, last, decades, of, the, sasanian, dynasty, the, fabrics, represent, what, could, be, called, a, sasanian, renaissance, with, styles, going, back, to, the, sasanian, or, sogdian, period, seljuk, fabrics, are, often, distinguished, by, the, representation, of, nature, by, minimal, ornamental, details, and, by, the, combination, of, colorful, linens, giving, an, interchangeable, color, effect, to, the, fabric, many, realistic, natural, elements, characterize, the, composition, of, the, fabrics, such, as, animals, and, plants, forming, patterns, consisting, of, arabesque, elements, in, many, manuscripts, of, the, period, great, care, is, taken, to, distinghuish, the, clothing, of, figures, of, power, and, authority, in, seljuk, style, from, that, of, the, otherwise, omnipresent, figures, in, arabic, or, local, style, with, their, long, robes, turbans, and, bare, or, sandalled, feet, according, to, snelders, in, a, number, of, these, manuscripts, a, careful, distinction, is, made, between, royal, and, non, royal, figures, both, in, terms, of, physical, appearance, and, dress, whereas, princes, and, governors, are, commonly, represented, with, the, same, asiatic, or, oriental, facial, features, and, dressed, in, turkish, military, garments, like, fur, trimmed, caps, sharbush, and, short, close, fitting, tunics, most, other, figures, are, depicted, with, arab, or, semitic, facial, features, and, dressed, in, long, robes, and, turbans, apparently, in, keeping, with, the, contemporary, political, and, social, makeup, of, the, region, in, which, these, manuscripts, were, produced, a, visual, distinction, was, made, along, ethnic, and, social, lines, between, the, non, arab, turkish, ruling, elite, and, the, indigenous, arab, bourgeoisie, the, dynasty, brought, revival, energy, and, reunion, to, the, islamic, civilization, hitherto, dominated, by, arabs, and, persians, the, seljuks, founded, universities, and, were, also, patrons, of, art, and, literature, their, reign, is, characterized, by, persian, astronomers, such, as, omar, khayy, m, and, the, persian, philosopher, al, ghazali, under, the, seljuks, new, persian, became, the, language, for, historical, recording, while, the, center, of, arabic, language, culture, shifted, from, baghdad, to, cairo, tokhara, yabghus, turk, shahis
