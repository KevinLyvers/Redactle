may, be, interchanged, and, eternal, the, company, which, benefited, from, the, imperial, patronage, soon, expanded, its, commercial, trading, operations, it, eclipsed, the, portuguese, estado, da, ndia, which, had, established, bases, in, goa, chittagong, and, bombay, portugal, later, ceded, bombay, to, england, as, part, of, the, dowry, of, catherine, of, braganza, on, her, marriage, to, king, charles, ii, the, east, india, company, also, launched, a, joint, attack, with, the, dutch, united, east, india, company, voc, on, portuguese, and, spanish, ships, off, the, coast, of, china, that, helped, secure, eic, ports, in, china, independently, attacking, the, portuguese, in, the, persian, gulf, residencies, primarily, for, political, reasons, the, company, established, trading, posts, in, surat, 1619, and, madras, 1639, by, 1647, the, company, had, 23, factories, and, settlements, in, india, and, 90, employees, many, of, the, major, factories, became, some, of, the, most, populated, and, commercially, influential, cities, in, bengal, including, the, walled, forts, of, fort, william, in, bengal, fort, st, george, in, madras, and, bombay, castle, the, first, century, of, the, company, despite, its, original, profits, coming, primarily, from, piracy, in, the, spice, islands, between, competing, european, powers, and, their, companies, saw, the, east, india, company, change, focus, after, suffering, a, major, setback, in, 1623, when, their, factory, in, amboyna, in, the, moluccas, was, attacked, by, the, dutch, this, compelled, the, company, to, formally, abandon, their, efforts, in, the, spice, islands, and, turn, their, attention, to, bengal, where, by, this, time, they, were, making, steady, if, less, exciting, profits, after, gaining, the, indifferent, patronage, of, the, mughal, empire, whose, cities, were, the, megacities, of, their, time, and, whose, wealth, was, unrivaled, outside, of, asia, in, the, 17th, century, the, company, spent, its, first, century, of, life, in, the, mughal, ruled, areas, cultivating, their, relationship, with, the, mughal, dynasty, and, conducting, peaceful, trade, at, great, profit, at, first, it, should, be, said, the, eic, was, drawn, into, the, mughal, system, acting, as, a, kind, of, vassal, to, mughal, authority, in, present, day, bangladesh, where, it, was, from, this, position, that, the, eic, would, ultimately, outplay, and, outmaneuver, everyone, else, in, the, region, to, eventually, use, that, same, system, to, hold, power, what, started, as, trading, posts, on, undesirable, land, often, islands, or, rich, fertile, lands, near, existing, population, centers, were, developed, into, sprawling, factory, complexes, with, hundreds, of, workers, providing, exotic, goods, back, to, england, and, offered, protected, points, to, export, english, finished, goods, to, local, merchants, the, company, s, initial, rise, in, bengal, and, successes, generally, came, at, the, expense, of, competing, european, powers, through, the, art, of, currying, favors, and, well, placed, bribes, as, the, company, was, matched, at, every, step, with, french, expansion, in, the, region, whose, equivalent, company, carried, substantial, royal, support, see, french, east, india, company, throughout, the, entire, century, the, company, only, resorted, to, force, against, the, mughals, once, with, terrible, consequences, the, anglo, mughal, war, 1686, 1690, was, a, complete, loss, ending, when, the, eic, effectively, declared, fealty, to, the, mughals, to, get, their, factories, back, the, east, india, company, s, fortunes, changed, for, the, better, in, 1707, as, bengal, and, other, regions, under, mughal, rule, fell, into, anarchy, with, the, death, of, the, mughal, emperor, aurangzeb, a, series, of, large, scale, rebellions, and, the, collapse, of, the, mughal, taxation, system, led, to, the, effective, independence, of, virtually, all, of, the, mughal, s, pre, 1707, fiefs, and, holdings, with, their, capital, delhi, routinely, under, the, control, of, either, maratha, afghan, or, usurper, general, s, armies, the, eic, was, able, to, take, advantage, of, this, chaos, slowly, wresting, direct, control, of, the, province, of, bengal, and, fought, numerous, wars, with, the, french, in, the, carnatic, wars, for, influence, and, control, of, the, east, coast, the, company, s, position, in, the, mughal, court, as, it, fell, apart, made, it, possible, to, sponsor, different, players, on, the, continent, as, they, individually, contended, with, others, steadily, amassing, an, ever, larger, position, on, the, continent, for, themselves, in, the, 18th, century, the, primary, tool, of, the, company, s, profits, in, bengal, became, taxation, in, conquered, and, controlled, provinces, as, the, factories, became, fortresses, and, administrative, hubs, for, networks, of, tax, collectors, that, expanded, into, enormous, cities, the, mughal, empire, was, the, richest, in, the, world, in, 1700, and, the, east, india, company, tried, to, strip, it, bare, for, a, century, thereafter, dalrymple, calls, it, the, single, largest, transfer, of, wealth, until, the, nazis, what, was, in, the, 17th, century, the, production, capital, of, the, world, for, textiles, was, forced, to, become, a, market, for, british, made, textiles, mansions, of, statues, and, their, jewels, untold, material, wealth, was, moved, from, the, palaces, of, bengal, to, the, townhouses, of, the, english, countryside, bengal, in, particular, suffered, the, worst, of, company, tax, farming, highlighted, by, the, great, bengal, famine, of, 1770, which, even, inspired, a, reprisal, from, the, king, in, response, to, the, brutality, meanwhile, the, primary, tool, of, expansion, for, the, company, was, the, sepoy, the, sepoy, was, a, locally, raised, mostly, muslim, western, trained, and, equipped, soldiers, that, changed, warfare, in, present, day, south, asia, mounted, forces, and, their, superior, mobility, had, been, king, on, the, regions, battlefields, for, a, thousand, years, cannon, so, well, integrated, the, mughals, fought, with, cannon, mounted, on, elephants, all, were, little, match, to, line, infantry, with, decent, discipline, supported, with, field, cannon, a, few, thousand, company, sepoys, time, and, again, took, on, vastly, superior, mughal, forces, numerically, and, came, out, victorious, sieged, fortifications, often, despite, poor, command, to, the, point, that, the, afghan, mughal, and, maratha, forces, started, building, and, supporting, their, own, western, style, forces, often, french, equipped, as, the, chaos, widened, and, the, stakes, were, raised, to, varying, success, in, the, end, the, company, won, out, generally, through, as, much, diplomacy, and, state, craft, fraud, and, deception, the, gradual, rise, of, the, eic, within, the, mughal, network, culminated, in, the, second, anglo, maratha, war, where, the, company, successfully, ousted, the, empire, s, official, protectors, in, the, maratha, the, maratha, high, water, point, in, their, rise, to, power, and, installed, a, young, mughal, prince, as, emperor, with, the, company, as, the, de, jure, protectors, of, the, empire, from, their, position, of, direct, control, in, bengal, this, relationship, was, repeatedly, strained, as, the, company, continued, its, expansion, and, exploitation, however, it, lasted, in, some, form, until, 1858, when, the, last, mughal, emperor, was, exiled, as, the, company, was, disbanded, and, its, assets, were, taken, over, by, the, british, crown, in, 1634, the, mughal, emperor, shah, jahan, extended, his, hospitality, to, the, english, traders, to, the, richest, region, of, the, mutual, empire, bengal, and, in, 1717, customs, duties, were, completely, waived, for, the, english, in, bengal, the, company, s, mainstay, businesses, were, by, then, cotton, silk, opium, indigo, dye, saltpetre, and, tea, the, dutch, were, aggressive, competitors, and, had, meanwhile, expanded, their, monopoly, of, the, spice, trade, in, the, straits, of, malacca, by, ousting, the, portuguese, in, 1640, 1641, with, reduced, portuguese, and, spanish, influence, in, the, region, the, eic, and, voc, entered, a, period, of, intense, competition, resulting, in, the, anglo, dutch, wars, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, british, were, also, interested, in, trans, himalayan, trade, routes, as, they, would, create, access, to, untapped, markets, for, british, manufactured, goods, in, tibet, and, china, this, economic, interest, was, showcased, by, the, anglo, nepalese, war, 1814, 1816, the, draft, history, of, the, qing, records, the, chinese, qing, dynasty, as, formally, commencing, trade, with, the, british, in, 1698, within, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 17th, century, the, dutch, east, india, company, or, vereenigde, oostindische, compagnie, voc, was, the, wealthiest, commercial, operation, in, the, world, with, 50, 000, employees, worldwide, and, a, private, fleet, of, 200, ships, it, specialised, in, the, spice, trade, and, gave, its, shareholders, 40, annual, dividend, the, british, east, india, company, was, fiercely, competitive, with, the, dutch, and, french, throughout, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, over, spices, from, the, spice, islands, some, spices, at, the, time, could, only, be, found, on, these, islands, such, as, nutmeg, and, cloves, and, they, could, bring, profits, as, high, as, 400, per, cent, from, one, voyage, the, tension, was, so, high, between, the, dutch, and, the, british, east, indies, trading, companies, that, it, escalated, into, at, least, four, anglo, dutch, wars, 1652, 1654, 1665, 1667, 1672, 1674, and, 1780, 1784, competition, arose, in, 1635, when, charles, i, granted, a, trading, licence, to, sir, william, courteen, which, permitted, the, rival, courteen, association, to, trade, with, the, east, at, any, location, in, which, the, eic, had, no, presence, in, an, act, aimed, at, strengthening, the, power, of, the, eic, king, charles, ii, granted, the, eic, in, a, series, of, five, acts, around, 1670, the, rights, to, autonomous, territorial, acquisitions, to, mint, money, to, command, fortresses, and, troops, and, form, alliances, to, make, war, and, peace, and, to, exercise, both, civil, and, criminal, jurisdiction, over, the, acquired, areas, in, 1689, a, mughal, fleet, commanded, by, sidi, yaqub, attacked, bombay, after, a, year, of, resistance, the, eic, surrendered, in, 1690, and, the, company, sent, envoys, to, aurangzeb, s, camp, to, plead, for, a, pardon, the, company, s, envoys, had, to, prostrate, themselves, before, the, emperor, pay, a, large, indemnity, and, promise, better, behaviour, in, the, future, the, emperor, withdrew, his, troops, and, the, company, subsequently, re, established, itself, in, bombay, and, set, up, a, new, base, in, calcutta, the, east, india, company, s, archives, suggest, its, involvement, in, the, slave, trade, began, in, 1684, when, a, captain, robert, knox, was, ordered, to, buy, and, transport, 250, slaves, from, madagascar, to, st, helena, the, east, india, company, began, using, and, transporting, slaves, in, asia, and, the, atlantic, in, the, early, 1620s, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, or, in, 1621, according, to, richard, allen, eventually, the, company, ended, the, trade, in, 1834, after, numerous, legal, threats, from, the, british, state, and, the, royal, navy, in, the, form, of, the, west, africa, squadron, which, discovered, various, ships, had, contained, evidence, of, the, illegal, trade, in, 1613, during, the, rule, of, tokugawa, hidetada, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, the, british, ship,

the, 1770s, in, exchange, for, goods, like, porcelain, and, tea, causing, a, series, of, opioid, addiction, outbreaks, across, china, in, 1820, the, ruling, qing, dynasty, outlawed, the, opium, trade, in, 1796, and, 1800, but, british, merchants, continued, illegally, nonetheless, the, qing, took, measures, to, prevent, the, east, india, company, from, selling, opium, and, destroyed, tens, of, thousands, of, chests, of, opium, already, in, the, country, this, series, of, events, led, to, the, first, opium, war, in, 1839, which, involved, a, succession, of, british, naval, attacks, along, the, chinese, coast, over, the, course, of, several, months, as, part, of, the, treaty, of, nanjing, in, 1842, the, qing, were, forced, to, give, british, merchants, special, treatment, and, the, right, to, sell, opium, the, chinese, also, ceded, territory, to, the, british, including, the, island, of, hong, kong, the, prosperity, that, the, officers, of, the, company, enjoyed, allowed, them, to, return, to, britain, and, establish, sprawling, estates, and, businesses, and, to, obtain, political, power, such, as, seats, in, the, house, of, commons, ship, captains, sold, their,

developed, a, lobby, in, the, english, parliament, pressure, from, ambitious, tradesmen, and, former, company, associates, pejoratively, termed, interlopers, by, the, company, who, wanted, to, establish, private, trading, firms, in, india, led, to, the, passing, of, the, deregulating, act, in, 1694, this, act, allowed, any, english, firm, to, trade, with, india, unless, specifically, prohibited, by, act, of, parliament, thereby, annulling, the, charter, that, had, been, in, force, for, almost, 100, years, when, the, east, india, company, act, 1697, 9, will, 3, c, 44, was, passed, in, 1697, a, new, parallel, east, india, company, officially, titled, the, english, company, trading, to, the, east, indies, was, floated, under, a, state, backed, indemnity, of, 2, million, the, powerful, stockholders, of, the, old, company, quickly, subscribed, a, sum, of, 315, 000, in, the, new, concern, and, dominated, the, new, body, the, two, companies, wrestled, with, each, other, for, some, time, both, in, england, and, in, india, for, a, dominant, share, of, the, trade, it, quickly, became, evident, that, in, practice, the, original, company, faced, scarcely, any, measurable, competition, the, companies, merged, in, 1708, by, a, tripartite, indenture, involving, both, companies, and, the, state, with, the, charter, and, agreement, for, the, new, united, company, of, merchants, of, england, trading, to, the, east, indies, being, awarded, by, sidney, godolphin, 1st, earl, of, godolphin, under, this, arrangement, the, merged, company, lent, a, sum, of, 3, 200, 000, to, the, treasury, in, return, for, exclusive, privileges, for, the, next, three, years, after, which, the, situation, was, to, be, reviewed, the, amalgamated, company, became, the, united, company, of, merchants, of, england, trading, to, the, east, indies, a, constant, battle, between, the, company, lobby, and, parliament, followed, for, decades, the, company, sought, a, permanent, establishment, while, parliament, would, not, willingly, allow, it, greater, autonomy, and, so, relinquish, the, opportunity, to, exploit, the, company, s, profits, in, 1712, another, act, renewed, the, status, of, the, company, though, the, debts, were, repaid, by, 1720, 15, of, british, imports, were, from, india, almost, all, passing, through, the, company, which, reasserted, the, influence, of, the, company, lobby, the, licence, was, prolonged, until, 1766, by, yet, another, act, in, 1730, at, this, time, britain, and, france, became, bitter, rivals, frequent, skirmishes, between, them, took, place, for, control, of, colonial, possessions, in, 1742, fearing, the, monetary, consequences, of, a, war, the, british, government, agreed, to, extend, the, deadline, for, the, licensed, exclusive, trade, by, the, company, in, india, until, 1783, in, return, for, a, further, loan, of, 1, million, between, 1756, and, 1763, the, seven, years, war, diverted, the, state, s, attention, towards, consolidation, and, defence, of, its, territorial, possessions, in, europe, and, its, colonies, in, north, america, the, war, partly, took, place, in, the, indian, theatre, between, the, company, troops, and, the, french, forces, in, 1757, the, law, officers, of, the, crown, delivered, the, pratt, yorke, opinion, distinguishing, overseas, territories, acquired, by, right, of, conquest, from, those, acquired, by, private, treaty, the, opinion, asserted, that, while, the, crown, of, great, britain, enjoyed, sovereignty, over, both, only, the, property, of, the, former, was, vested, in, the, crown, with, the, advent, of, the, industrial, revolution, britain, surged, ahead, of, its, european, rivals, demand, for, indian, commodities, was, boosted, by, the, need, to, sustain, troops, and, the, economy, during, the, war, and, by, the, increased, availability, of, raw, materials, and, efficient, methods, of, production, as, home, to, the, revolution, britain, experienced, higher, standards, of, living, its, ever, growing, cycle, of, prosperity, demand, and, production, had, a, profound, influence, on, overseas, trade, the, company, became, the, single, largest, player, in, the, british, global, market, in, 1801, henry, dundas, reported, to, the, house, of, commons, that, on, the, 1st, march, 1801, the, debts, of, the, east, india, company, amounted, to, 5, 393, 989, l, their, effects, to, 15, 404, 736, l, and, that, their, sales, had, increased, since, february, 1793, from, 4, 988, 300, l, to, 7, 602, 041, l, sir, john, banks, a, businessman, from, kent, who, negotiated, an, agreement, between, the, king, and, the, company, began, his, career, in, a, syndicate, arranging, contracts, for, victualling, the, navy, an, interest, he, kept, up, for, most, of, his, life, he, knew, that, samuel, pepys, and, john, evelyn, had, amassed, a, substantial, fortune, from, the, levant, and, indian, trades, he, became, a, director, and, later, as, governor, of, the, east, india, company, in, 1672, he, arranged, a, contract, which, included, a, loan, of, 20, 000, and, 30, 000, worth, of, saltpetre, also, known, as, potassium, nitrate, a, primary, ingredient, in, gunpowder, for, the, king, at, the, price, it, shall, sell, by, the, candle, that, is, by, auction, where, bidding, could, continue, as, long, as, an, inch, long, candle, remained, alight, outstanding, debts, were, also, agreed, and, the, company, permitted, to, export, 250, tons, of, saltpetre, again, in, 1673, banks, successfully, negotiated, another, contract, for, 700, tons, of, saltpetre, at, 37, 000, between, the, king, and, the, company, so, high, was, the, demand, from, armed, forces, that, the, authorities, sometimes, turned, a, blind, eye, on, the, untaxed, sales, one, governor, of, the, company, was, even, reported, as, saying, in, 1864, that, he, would, rather, have, the, saltpetre, made, than, the, tax, on, salt, the, seven, years, war, 1756, 1763, resulted, in, the, defeat, of, the, french, forces, limited, french, imperial, ambitions, and, stunted, the, influence, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, french, territories, robert, clive, the, governor, general, led, the, company, to, a, victory, against, joseph, fran, ois, dupleix, the, commander, of, the, french, forces, in, india, and, recaptured, fort, st, george, from, the, french, the, company, took, this, respite, to, seize, manila, in, 1762, by, the, treaty, of, paris, france, regained, the, five, establishments, captured, by, the, british, during, the, war, pondich, ry, mahe, karaikal, yanam, and, chandernagar, but, was, prevented, from, erecting, fortifications, and, keeping, troops, in, bengal, art, xi, elsewhere, in, india, the, french, were, to, remain, a, military, threat, particularly, during, the, war, of, american, independence, and, up, to, the, capture, of, pondich, ry, in, 1793, at, the, outset, of, the, french, revolutionary, wars, without, any, military, presence, although, these, small, outposts, remained, french, possessions, for, the, next, two, hundred, years, french, ambitions, on, indian, territories, were, effectively, laid, to, rest, thus, eliminating, a, major, source, of, economic, competition, for, the, company, in, may, 1772, the, eic, stock, price, rose, significantly, in, june, alexander, fordyce, lost, 300, 000, shorting, eic, stock, leaving, his, partners, liable, for, an, estimated, 243, 000, in, debts, as, this, information, became, public, 20, 30, banks, across, europe, collapsed, during, the, british, credit, crisis, of, 1772, 1773, in, india, alone, the, company, had, bill, debts, of, 1, 2, million, it, seems, that, eic, directors, james, cockburn, and, george, colebrooke, were, bulling, the, amsterdam, market, during, 1772, the, root, of, this, crisis, in, relation, to, the, east, india, company, came, from, the, prediction, by, isaac, de, pinto, that, peace, conditions, plus, an, abundance, of, money, would, push, east, indian, shares, to, exorbitant, heights, in, september, the, company, took, out, a, loan, from, the, bank, of, england, to, be, repaid, from, the, sale, of, goods, later, that, month, but, with, buyers, scarce, most, of, the, sale, had, to, be, postponed, and, when, the, loan, fell, due, the, company, s, coffers, were, empty, on, october, 29, the, bank, refused, to, renew, the, loan, that, decision, set, in, motion, a, chain, of, events, that, made, the, american, revolution, inevitable, the, east, india, company, had, eighteen, million, pounds, of, tea, sitting, in, british, warehouses, a, huge, amount, of, tea, as, assets, which, were, lying, unsold, selling, it, in, a, hurry, would, do, wonders, for, its, finances, on, 14, january, 1773, the, directors, of, the, eic, asked, for, a, government, loan, and, unlimited, access, to, the, tea, market, in, the, american, colonies, both, of, which, were, granted, in, august, 1773, the, bank, of, england, assisted, the, eic, with, a, loan, the, east, india, company, had, also, been, granted, competitive, advantages, over, colonial, american, tea, importers, to, sell, tea, from, its, colonies, in, asia, in, american, colonies, this, led, to, the, boston, tea, party, of, 1773, in, which, protesters, boarded, british, ships, and, threw, the, tea, overboard, when, protesters, successfully, prevented, the, unloading, of, tea, in, three, other, colonies, and, in, boston, governor, thomas, hutchinson, of, the, province, of, massachusetts, bay, refused, to, allow, the, tea, to, be, returned, to, britain, this, was, one, of, the, incidents, which, led, to, the, american, revolution, and, independence, of, the, american, colonies, the, company, s, trade, monopoly, with, india, was, abolished, in, the, charter, act, 1813, the, monopoly, with, china, was, ended, in, 1833, ending, the, trading, activities, of, the, company, and, rendering, its, activities, purely, administrative, in, the, aftermath, of, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, and, under, the, provisions, of, the, government, of, india, act, 1858, the, british, government, nationalised, the, company, the, british, government, took, over, its, indian, possessions, its, administrative, powers, and, machinery, and, its, armed, forces, the, company, had, already, divested, itself, of, its, commercial, trading, assets, in, india, in, favour, of, the, uk, government, in, 1833, with, the, latter, assuming, the, debts, and, obligations, of, the, company, which, were, to, be, serviced, and, paid, from, tax, revenue, raised, in, india, in, return, the, shareholders, voted, to, accept, an, annual, dividend, of, 10, 5, guaranteed, for, forty, years, likewise, to, be, funded, from, india, with, a, final, pay, off, to, redeem, outstanding, shares, the, debt, obligations, continued, beyond, dissolution, and, were, only, extinguished, by, the, uk, government, during, the, second, world, war, the, company, remained, in, existence, in, vestigial, form, continuing, to, manage, the, tea, trade, on, behalf, of, the, british, government, and, the, supply, of, saint, helena, until, the, east, india, stock, dividend, redemption, act, 1873, came, into, effect, on, 1, january, 1874, this, act, provided, for, the, formal, dissolution, of, the, company, on, 1, june, 1874, after, a, final, dividend, payment, and, the, commutation, or, redemption, of, its, stock, the, times, commented, on, 8, april, 1873, it, accomplished, a, work, such, as, in, the, whole, history, of, the, human, race, no, other, trading, company, ever, attempted, and, such, as, none, surely, is, likely, to, attempt, in, the, years, to, come, the, company, s, headquarters, in, london, from, which, much, of, india, was, governed, was, east,
