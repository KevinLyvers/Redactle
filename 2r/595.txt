jigjiga, dire, dawa, and, harar, siad, barre, decided, to, intensify, the, war, by, involving, the, somali, army, as, he, believed, it, would, allow, the, wslf, to, press, home, their, growing, victories, and, enable, the, complete, secession, of, the, ogaden, on, 13, july, 1977, the, ogaden, war, was, triggered, when, the, somali, democratic, republic, invaded, the, ogaden, region, in,

with, the, draining, effects, of, constant, warfare, separatist, guerrilla, movements, in, eritrea, and, tigray, resulted, in, a, drastic, decline, in, general, productivity, of, food, and, cash,

in, which, 400, 000, 590, 000, people, are, estimated, to, have, died, hundreds, of, thousands, fled, economic, misery, conscription, and, political, repression, and, went, to, live, in, neighboring, countries, and, all, over, the, western, world, creating, an, ethiopian, diaspora, community, for, the, first, time, in, its, history, insurrections, against, the, derg, s, rule, sprang, up, with, ferocity, particularly, in, the, northern, regions, of, tigray, and, eritrea, which, sought, independence, and, in, some, regions, in, the, ogaden, hundreds, of, thousands, were, killed, as, a, result, of, the, qey, shibir, forced, deportations, the, derg, continued, its, attempts, to, end, rebellions, with, military, force, by, initiating, several, campaigns, against, both, internal,

for, a, push, on, the, capital, addis, ababa, became, successful, there, was, some, fear, that, mengistu, would, attempt, to, fight, to, the, bitter, end, for, the, capital, but, after, diplomatic, intervention, by, the, united, states, he, fled, to, asylum, in, zimbabwe, where, he, still, resides, the, regime, only, survived, another, week, after, his, ousting, before, the, eprdf, poured, into, the, capital, and, captured, addis, ababa, the, eprdf, immediately, disbanded, the, workers, party, of, ethiopia, and, shortly, afterward, arrested, almost, all, of, the, most, prominent, derg,
