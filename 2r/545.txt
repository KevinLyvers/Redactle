during, the, cold, war, the, iron, curtain, was, a, political, metaphor, used, to, describe, the, political, and, later, physical, boundary, dividing, europe, into, two, separate, areas, from, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1945, until, the, end, of, the, cold, war, in, 1991, the, term, symbolizes, the, efforts, by, the, soviet, union, ussr, to, block, itself, and, its, satellite, states, from, open, contact, with, the, west, its, allies, and, neutral, states, on, the, east, side, of, the, iron, curtain, were, the, countries, that, were, connected, to, or, influenced, by, the, soviet, union, while, on, the, west, side, were, the, countries, that, were, nato, members, or, connected, to, or, influenced, by, the, united, states, or, nominally, neutral, separate, international, economic, and, military, alliances, were, developed, on, each, side, of, the, iron, curtain, it, later, became, a, term, for, the, 7, 000, kilometre, long, 4, 300, mi, physical, barrier, of, fences, walls, minefields, and, watchtowers, that, divided, the, east, and, west, the, berlin, wall, was, also, part, of, this, physical, barrier, the, nations, to, the, east, of, the, iron, curtain, were, poland, east, germany, czechoslovakia, hungary, romania, bulgaria, albania, and, the, ussr, however, east, germany, czechoslovakia, and, the, ussr, have, since, ceased, to, exist, countries, that,

socialist, state, in, europe, to, overthrow, its, government, with, violence, the, use, of, the, term, iron, curtain, as, a, metaphor, for, strict, separation, goes, back, at, least, as, far, as, the, early, 19th, century, it, originally, referred, to, fireproof, curtains, in, theaters, the, author, alexander, campbell, used, the, term, metaphorically, in, his, 1945, book, it, s, your, empire, describing, an, iron, curtain, of, silence, and, censorship, has, descended, since, the, japanese, conquests, of, 1942, its, popularity, as, a, cold, war, symbol, is, attributed, to, its, use, in, a, speech, winston, churchill, gave, on, 5, march, 1946, in, fulton, missouri, soon, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, on, the, one, hand, the, iron, curtain, was, a, separating, barrier, between, the, power, blocs, and, on, the, other, hand, natural, biotopes, were, formed, here, as, the, european, green, belt, shows, today, in, the, 19th, century, iron, safety, curtains, were, installed, on, theater, stages, to, slow, the, spread, of, fire, perhaps, the, first, recorded, application, of, the, term, iron, curtain, to, soviet, russia, was, in, vasily, rozanov, s, 1918, polemic, the, apocalypse, of, our, time, it, is, possible, that, churchill, read, it, there, following, the, publication, of, the, book, s, english, translation, in, 1920, the, passage, runs, with, clanging, creaking, and, squeaking, an, iron, curtain, is, lowering, over, russian, history, the, performance, is, over, the, audience, got, up, time, to, put, on, your, fur, coats, and, go, home, we, looked, around, but, the, fur, coats, and, homes, were, missing, in, 1920, ethel, snowden, in, her, book, through, bolshevik, russia, used, the, term, in, reference, to, the, soviet, border, a, may, 1943, article, in, signal, a, german, propaganda, periodical, discussed, the, iron, curtain, that, more, than, ever, before, separates, the, world, from, the, soviet, union, joseph, goebbels, commented, in, das, reich, on, 25, february, 1945, that, if, germany, should, lose, the, war, an, iron, curtain, would, fall, over, this, enormous, territory, controlled, by, the, soviet, union, behind, which, nations, would, be, slaughtered, german, leading, minister, lutz, von, krosigk, broadcast, 2, may, 1945, in, the, east, the, iron, curtain, behind, which, unseen, by, the, eyes, of, the, world, the, work, of, destruction, goes, on, is, moving, steadily, forward, churchill, s, first, recorded, use, of, the, term, iron, curtain, came, in, a, 12, may, 1945, telegram, he, sent, to, u, s, president, harry, s, truman, regarding, his, concern, about, soviet, actions, stating, n, iron, curtain, is, drawn, down, upon, their, front, we, do, not, know, what, is, going, on, behind, he, repeated, it, in, another, telegram, to, truman, on, june, 4, mentioning, the, descent, of, an, iron, curtain, between, us, and, everything, to, the, eastward, and, in, a, house, of, commons, speech, on, 16, august, 1945, stating, it, is, not, impossible, that, tragedy, on, a, prodigious, scale, is, unfolding, itself, behind, the, iron, curtain, which, at, the, moment, divides, europe, in, twain, the, antagonism, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, west, that, came, to, be, described, as, the, iron, curtain, had, various, origins, during, the, summer, of, 1939, after, conducting, negotiations, both, with, a, british, french, group, and, with, nazi, germany, regarding, potential, military, and, political, agreements, the, soviet, union, and, nazi, germany, signed, the, german, soviet, commercial, agreement, which, provided, for, the, trade, of, certain, german, military, and, civilian, equipment, in, exchange, for, soviet, raw, materials, and, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, signed, in, late, august, 1939, named, after, the, foreign, secretaries, of, the, two, countries, vyacheslav, molotov, and, joachim, von, ribbentrop, which, included, a, secret, agreement, to, split, poland, and, eastern, europe, between, the, two, states, the, soviets, thereafter, occupied, eastern, poland, september, 1939, latvia, june, 1940, lithuania, 1940, northern, romania, bessarabia, and, northern, bukovina, late, june, 1940, estonia, 1940, and, eastern, finland, march, 1940, from, august, 1939, relations, between, the, west, and, the, soviets, deteriorated, further, when, the, soviet, union, and, nazi, germany, engaged, in, an, extensive, economic, relationship, by, which, the, soviet, union, sent, germany, vital, oil, rubber, manganese, and, other, materials, in, exchange, for, german, weapons, manufacturing, machinery, and, technology, nazi, soviet, trade, ended, in, june, 1941, when, germany, broke, the, pact, and, invaded, the, soviet, union, in, operation, barbarossa, in, the, course, of, world, war, ii, stalin, determined, to, acquire, a, buffer, area, against, germany, with, pro, soviet, states, on, its, border, in, an, eastern, bloc, stalin, s, aims, led, to, strained, relations, at, the, yalta, conference, february, 1945, and, the, subsequent, potsdam, conference, july, august, 1945, people, in, the, west, expressed, opposition, to, soviet, domination, over, the, buffer, states, and, the, fear, grew, that, the, soviets, were, building, an, empire, that, might, be, a, threat, to, them, and, their, interests, nonetheless, at, the, potsdam, conference, the, allies, assigned, parts, of, poland, finland, romania, germany, and, the, balkans, to, soviet, control, or, influence, in, return, stalin, promised, the, western, allies, that, he, would, allow, those, territories, the, right, to, national, self, determination, despite, soviet, cooperation, during, the, war, these, concessions, left, many, in, the, west, uneasy, in, particular, churchill, feared, that, the, united, states, might, return, to, its, pre, war, isolationism, leaving, the, exhausted, european, states, unable, to, resist, soviet, demands, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, had, announced, at, yalta, that, after, the, defeat, of, germany, u, s, forces, would, withdraw, from, europe, within, two, years, winston, churchill, s, sinews, of, peace, address, of, 5, march, 1946, at, westminster, college, in, fulton, missouri, publicly, used, the, term, iron, curtain, in, the, context, of, soviet, dominated, eastern, europe, from, stettin, in, the, baltic, to, trieste, in, the, adriatic, an, iron, curtain, has, descended, across, the, continent, behind, that, line, lie, all, the, capitals, of, the, ancient, states, of, central, and, eastern, europe, warsaw, berlin, prague, vienna, budapest, belgrade, bucharest, and, sofia, all, these, famous, cities, and, the, populations, around, them, lie, in, what, i, must, call, the, soviet, sphere, and, all, are, subject, in, one, form, or, another, not, only, to, soviet, influence, but, to, a, very, high, and, in, some, cases, increasing, measure, of, control, from, moscow, much, of, the, western, public, still, regarded, the, soviet, union, as, a, close, ally, in, the, context, of, the, 1945, defeat, of, nazi, germany, and, of, imperial, japan, although, not, well, received, at, the, time, the, phrase, iron, curtain, gained, popularity, as, a, shorthand, reference, to, the, division, of, europe, as, the, cold, war, progressed, the, iron, curtain, served, to, keep, people, in, and, information, out, people, throughout, the, west, eventually, came, to, accept, and, use, the, metaphor, churchill, s, sinews, of, peace, address, strongly, criticized, the, soviet, union, s, exclusive, and, secretive, tension, policies, along, with, the, eastern, europe, s, state, form, the, police, government, german, polizeistaat, he, expressed, the, western, allied, nations, distrust, of, the, soviet, union, after, the, world, war, ii, in, september, 1946, us, soviet, cooperation, would, collapse, due, to, the, us, disavowal, of, the, soviet, union, s, opinion, on, the, german, problem, in, the, stuttgart, council, and, then, followed, the, announcement, by, us, president, harry, s, truman, of, a, hard, line, anti, soviet, anticommunist, policy, after, that, the, phrase, iron, curtain, became, more, widely, used, as, an, anti, soviet, term, in, the, west, additionally, churchill, mentioned, in, his, speech, that, regions, under, the, soviet, union, s, control, were, expanding, their, leverage, and, power, without, any, restriction, he, asserted, that, in, order, to, put, a, brake, on, this, ongoing, phenomenon, the, commanding, force, of, and, strong, unity, between, the, uk, and, the, us, was, necessary, stalin, took, note, of, churchill, s, speech, and, responded, in, pravda, in, mid, march, 1946, he, accused, churchill, of, warmongering, and, defended, soviet, friendship, with, eastern, european, states, as, a, necessary, safeguard, against, another, invasion, stalin, further, accused, churchill, of, hoping, to, install, right, wing, governments, in, eastern, europe, with, the, goal, of, agitating, those, states, against, the, soviet, union, andrei, zhdanov, stalin, s, chief, propagandist, used, the, term, against, the, west, in, an, august, 1946, speech, hard, as, bourgeois, politicians, and, writers, may, strive, to, conceal, the, truth, of, the, achievements, of, the, soviet, order, and, soviet, culture, hard, as, they, may, strive, to, erect, an, iron, curtain, to, keep, the, truth, about, the, soviet, union, from, penetrating, abroad, hard, as, they, may, strive, to, belittle, the, genuine, growth, and, scope, of, soviet, culture, all, their, efforts, are, foredoomed, to, failure, while, the, iron, curtain, remained, in, place, much, of, eastern, europe, and, many, parts, of, central, europe, except, west, germany, liechtenstein, switzerland, and, most, of, austria, all, of, austria, after, the, withdrawal, of, occupying, allied, forces, and, the, declaration, of, austria, s, neutrality, that, resulted, from, the, austrian, state, treaty, in, 1955, found, themselves, under, the, hegemony, of, the, soviet, union, which, had, annexed, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, as, soviet, socialist, republics, germany, effectively, gave, moscow, a, free, hand, in, much, of, these, territories, in, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, of, 1939, signed, before, germany, s, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1941, other, soviet, annexed, territories, included, between, 1945, and, 1949, the, soviets, converted, the, following, areas, into, satellite, states, soviet, installed, governments, ruled, the, eastern, bloc, countries, with, the, exception, of, the, socialist, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, which, changed, its, orientation, away, from, the, soviet, union, in, the, late, 1940s, to, a, progressively, independent, worldview, the, majority, of, european, states, to, the, east, of, the, iron, curtain, developed, their, own, international, economic, and, military, alliances, such, as, comecon, and, the, warsaw, pact, to, the, west, of, the, iron, curtain, the, countries, of, western, europe, northern, europe, and, southern, europe, along, with, austria, west, germany, liechtenstein, and, switzerland, operated, market, economies, with, the, exception, of, a, period, of, fascism, in, spain, until, 1975, and, portugal, until, 1974, and, a, military, dictatorship, in, greece, 1967, 1974, democratic, governments, ruled, these, countries, most, of, the, states, of, europe, to, the, west, of, the, iron, curtain, with, the, exception, of, neutral, switzerland, liechtenstein, austria, sweden, finland, malta, and, ireland, allied, themselves, with, canada, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, within, nato, spain, was, a, unique, anomaly, in, that, it, stayed, neutral, and, non, aligned, until, 1982, when, following, democracy, s, return, it, joined, nato, economically, the, european, community, ec, and, the, european, free, trade, association, represented, western, counterparts, to, comecon, most, of, the, nominally, neutral, states, were, economically, closer, to, the, united, states, than, they, were, to, the, warsaw, pact, in, january, 1947, harry, truman, appointed, general, george, marshall, as, secretary, of, state, scrapped, joint, chiefs, of, staff, jcs, directive, 1067, which, embodied, the, morgenthau, plan, and, supplanted, it, with, jcs, 1779, which, decreed, that, an, orderly, and, prosperous, europe, requires, the, economic, contributions, of, a, stable, and, productive, germany, officials, met, with, soviet, foreign, minister, vyacheslav, molotov, and, others, to, press, for, an, economically, self, sufficient, germany, including, a, detailed, accounting, of, the, industrial, plants, goods, and, infrastructure, already, removed, by, the, soviets, after, five, and, a, half, weeks, of, negotiations, molotov, refused, the, demands, and, the, talks, were, adjourned, marshall, was, particularly, discouraged, after, personally, meeting, with, stalin, who, expressed, little, interest, in, a, solution, to, german, economic, problems, the, united, states, concluded, that, a, solution, could, not, wait, any, longer, in, a, 5, june, 1947, speech, marshall, announced, a, comprehensive, program, of, american, assistance, to, all, european, countries, wanting, to, participate, including, the, soviet, union, and, those, of, eastern, europe, called, the, marshall, plan, stalin, opposed, the, marshall, plan, he, had, built, up, the, eastern, bloc, protective, belt, of, soviet, controlled, nations, on, his, western, border, and, wanted, to, maintain, this, buffer, zone, of, states, combined, with, a, weakened, germany, under, soviet, control, fearing, american, political, cultural, and, economic, penetration, stalin, eventually, forbade, soviet, eastern, bloc, countries, of, the, newly, formed, cominform, from, accepting, marshall, plan, aid, in, czechoslovakia, that, required, a, soviet, backed, czechoslovak, coup, d, tat, of, 1948, the, brutality, of, which, shocked, western, powers, more, than, any, event, so, far, and, set, in, a, motion, a, brief, scare, that, war, would, occur, and, swept, away, the, last, vestiges, of, opposition, to, the, marshall, plan, in, the, united, states, congress, relations, further, deteriorated, when, in, january, 1948, the, u, s, state, department, also, published, a, collection, of, documents, titled, nazi, soviet, relations, 1939, 1941, documents, from, the, archives, of, the, german, foreign, office, which, contained, documents, recovered, from, the, foreign, office, of, nazi, germany, revealing, soviet, conversations, with, germany, regarding, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, including, its, secret, protocol, dividing, eastern, europe, the, 1939, german, soviet, commercial, agreement, and, discussions, of, the, soviet, union, potentially, becoming, the, fourth, axis, power, in, response, one, month, later, the, soviet, union, published, falsifiers, of, history, a, stalin, edited, and, partially, rewritten, book, attacking, the, west, after, the, marshall, plan, the, introduction, of, a, new, currency, to, western, germany, to, replace, the, debased, reichsmark, and, massive, electoral, losses, for, communist, parties, in, june, 1948, the, soviet, union, cut, off, surface, road, access, to, berlin, initiating, the, berlin, blockade, which, cut, off, all, non, soviet, food, water, and, other, supplies, for, the, citizens, of, the, non, soviet, sectors, of, berlin, because, berlin, was, located, within, the, soviet, occupied, zone, of, germany, the, only, available, methods, of, supplying, the, city, were, three, limited, air, corridors, a, massive, aerial, supply, campaign, was, initiated, by, the, united, states, britain, france, and, other, countries, the, success, of, which, caused, the, soviets, to, lift, their, blockade, in, may, 1949, one, of, the, conclusions, of, the, yalta, conference, was, that, the, western, allies, would, return, all, soviet, citizens, who, found, themselves, in, their, zones, to, the, soviet, union, this, affected, the, liberated, soviet, prisoners, of, war, branded, as, traitors, forced, laborers, anti, soviet, collaborators, with, the, germans, and, anti, communist, refugees, migration, from, east, to, west, of, the, iron, curtain, except, under, limited, circumstances, was, effectively, halted, after, 1950, before, 1950, over, 15, million, people, mainly, ethnic, germans, emigrated, from, soviet, occupied, eastern, european, countries, to, the, west, in, the, five, years, immediately, following, world, war, ii, however, restrictions, implemented, during, the, cold, war, stopped, most, east, west, migration, with, only, 13, 3, million, migrations, westward, between, 1950, and, 1990, more, than, 75, of, those, emigrating, from, eastern, bloc, countries, between, 1950, and, 1990, did, so, under, bilateral, agreements, for, ethnic, migration, about, 10, were, refugees, permitted, to, emigrate, under, the, geneva, convention, of, 1951, most, soviets, allowed, to, leave, during, this, time, period, were, ethnic, jews, permitted, to, emigrate, to, israel, after, a, series, of, embarrassing, defections, in, 1970, caused, the, soviets, to, open, very, limited, ethnic, emigrations, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, was, accompanied, by, a, massive, rise, in, european, east, west, migration, behind, me, stands, a, wall, that, encircles, the, free, sectors, of, this, city, part, of, a, vast, system, of, barriers, that, divides, the, entire, continent, of, europe, from, the, baltic, south, those, barriers, cut, across, germany, in, a, gash, of, barbed, wire, concrete, dog, runs, and, guard, towers, farther, south, there, may, be, no, visible, no, obvious, wall, but, there, remain, armed, guards, and, checkpoints, all, the, same, still, a, restriction, on, the, right, to, travel, still, an, instrument, to, impose, upon, ordinary, men, and, women, the, will, of, a, totalitarian, state, ronald, reagan, at, the, tear, down, this, wall, speech, in, 1987, which, was, written, by, peter, robinson, the, iron, curtain, took, physical, shape, in, the, form, of, border, defences, between, the, countries, of, western, and, eastern, europe, there, were, some, of, the, most, heavily, militarised, areas, in, the, world, particularly, the, so, called, inner, german, border, commonly, known, as, die, grenze, in, german, between, east, and, west, germany, elsewhere, along, the, border, between, west, and, east, the, defence, works, resembled, those, on, the, intra, german, border, during, the, cold, war, the, border, zone, in, hungary, started, 15, kilometres, 9, 3, mi, from, the, border, citizens, could, only, enter, the, area, if, they, lived, in, the, zone, or, had, a, passport, valid, for, traveling, out, traffic, control, points, and, patrols, enforced, this, regulation, those, who, lived, within, the, 15, kilometres, 9, 3, mi, border, zone, needed, special, permission, to, enter, the, area, within, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, mi, of, the, border, the, area, was, very, difficult, to, approach, and, heavily, fortified, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, a, double, barbed, wire, fence, was, installed, 50, metres, 160, ft, from, the, border, the, space, between, the, two, fences, was, laden, with, land, mines, the, minefield, was, later, replaced, with, an, electric, signal, fence, about, 1, kilometre, 0, 62, mi, from, the, border, and, a, barbed, wire, fence, along, with, guard, towers, and, a, sand, strip, to, track, border, violations, regular, patrols, sought, to, prevent, escape, attempts, they, included, cars, and, mounted, units, guards, and, dog, patrol, units, watched, the, border, 24, 7, and, were, authorised, to, use, their, weapons, to, stop, escapees, the, wire, fence, nearest, the, actual, border, was, irregularly, displaced, from, the, actual, border, which, was, marked, only, by, stones, anyone, attempting, to, escape, would, have, to, cross, up, to, 400, metres, 1, 300, ft, before, they, could, cross, the, actual, border, several, escape, attempts, failed, when, the, escapees, were, stopped, after, crossing, the, outer, fence, the, creation, of, these, highly, militarised, no, man, s, lands, led, to, de, facto, nature, reserves, and, created, a, wildlife, corridor, across, europe, this, helped, the, spread, of, several, species, to, new, territories, since, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, several, initiatives, are, pursuing, the, creation, of, a, european, green, belt, nature, preserve, area, along, the, iron, curtain, s, former, route, in, fact, a, long, distance, cycling, route, along, the, length, of, the, former, border, called, the, iron, curtain, trail, ict, exists, as, a, project, of, the, european, union, and, other, associated, nations, the, trail, is, 6, 800, km, 4, 200, mi, long, and, spans, from, finland, to, greece, the, term, iron, curtain, was, only, used, for, the, fortified, borders, in, europe, it, was, not, used, for, similar, borders, in, asia, between, socialist, and, capitalist, states, these, were, for, a, time, dubbed, the, bamboo, curtain, the, border, between, north, korea, and, south, korea, is, very, comparable, to, the, former, inner, german, border, particularly, in, its, degree, of, militarisation, but, it, has, never, conventionally, been, considered, part, of, any, iron, curtain, the, soviet, union, built, a, fence, along, the, entire, border, towards, norway, and, finland, it, is, located, one, or, a, few, kilometres, from, the, border, and, has, automatic, alarms, detecting, if, someone, climbs, over, it, historian, juha, pohjonen, stated, in, a, 2005, study, that, people, who, escaped, the, ussr, to, finland, were, sent, back, based, on, a, policy, that, was, implemented, unilaterally, by, uhro, kekkonen, when, he, took, office, in, 1956, see, also, the, ussr, border, guard, in, estonia, the, people, s, republic, of, poland, was, a, satellite, state, of, the, soviet, union, it, bordered, no, western, countries, but, it, had, many, ports, to, the, baltic, sea, the, inner, german, border, was, marked, in, rural, areas, by, double, fences, made, of, steel, mesh, expanded, metal, with, sharp, edges, while, near, urban, areas, a, high, concrete, barrier, similar, to, the, berlin, wall, was, built, the, installation, of, the, wall, in, 1961, brought, an, end, to, a, decade, during, which, the, divided, capital, of, divided, germany, was, one, of, the, easiest, places, to, move, west, across, the, iron, curtain, the, barrier, was, always, a, short, distance, inside, east, german, territory, to, avoid, any, intrusion, into, western, territory, the, actual, borderline, marked, by, posts, and, signs, was, overlooked, by, numerous, watchtowers, set, behind, the, barrier, the, strip, of, land, on, the, west, german, side, of, the, barrier, between, the, actual, borderline, and, the, barrier, was, readily, accessible, but, only, at, considerable, personal, risk, because, it, was, patrolled, by, both, east, and, west, german, border, guards, several, villages, many, historic, were, destroyed, as, they, lay, too, close, to, the, border, for, example, erlebach, shooting, incidents, were, not, uncommon, and, several, hundred, civilians, and, 28, east, german, border, guards, were, killed, between, 1948, and, 1981, some, of, which, may, have, been, incidents, of, friendly, fire, the, helmstedt, marienborn, border,
