the, major, civilizations, while, much, philosophy, art, and, science, was, created, within, its, borders, the, only, textual, record, of, the, empire, s, history, today, comes, from, inscriptions,

to, the, kushan, emperor, as, ku, a, kushana, some, later, indian, literary, sources, referred, to, the, kushans, as, turushka, a, name, which, in, later, sanskrit, sources, was, confused, with, turk, probably, due, to, the, fact, that, tukharistan, passed, into, the, hands, of, the, western, turks, in, the, seventh, century, according, to, john, m, rosenfield, turushka, tukh, ra, or, tukh, ra,

by, palamedes, this, proves, that, hellenistic, populations, still, remained, in, bactria, up, into, the, kushan, era, and, also, explains, how, the, greek, alphabet, could, have, been, applied, to,

being, established, along, these, land, routes, that, went, from, china, and, other, parts, of, asia, with, the, development, of, buddhist, books, it, caused, a, new, written, language, called, gandhara, gandhara, consists, of, eastern, afghanistan, and, northern, pakistan, scholars, are, said, to, have, found, many, buddhist, scrolls, that, contained, the, gandhari, language, the, reign, of, huvishka, corresponds, to, the, first, known, epigraphic, evidence, of, the, buddha, amitabha, on, the, bottom, part, of, a, 2nd, century, statue, which, has, been, found, in, govindo, nagar, and, now, at, the, mathura, museum, the, statue, is, dated, to, the, 28th, year, of, the, reign, of, huvishka, and, dedicated, to, amitabha, buddha, by, a, family, of, merchants, there, is, also, some, evidence, that, huvishka, himself, was, a, follower, of, mahayana, buddhism, a, sanskrit, manuscript, fragment, in, the, sch, yen, collection, describes, huvishka, as, one, who, has, set, forth, in, the, mah, y, na, the, 12th, century, historical, chronicle, rajatarangini, mentions, in, detail, the, rule, of, the, kushan, kings, and, their, benevolence, towards, buddhism, then, there, ruled, in, this, very, land, the, founders, of, cities, called, after, their, own, appellations, the, three, kings, named, huska, juska, and, kaniska, these, kings, albeit, belonging, to, the, turkish, race, found, refuge, in, acts, of, piety, they, constructed, in, suskaletra, and, other, places, monasteries, caityas, and, similar, edificies, during, the, glorious, period, of, their, regime, the, kingdom, of, kashmir, was, for, the, most, part, an, appanage, of, the, buddhists, who, had, acquired, lustre, by, renunciation, at, this, time, since, the, nirvana, of, the, blessed, sakya, simha, in, this, terrestrial, world, one, hundred, fifty, years, it, is, said, had, elapsed, and, a, bodhisattva, was, in, this, country, the, sole, supreme, ruler, of, the, land, he, was, the, illustrious, nagarjuna, who, dwelt, in, sadarhadvana, the, art, and, culture, of, gandhara, at, the, crossroads, of, the, kushan, hegemony, developed, the, traditions, of, greco, buddhist, art, and, are, the, best, known, expressions, of, kushan, influences, to, westerners, several, direct, depictions, of, kushans, are, known, from, gandhara, where, they, are, represented, with, a, tunic, belt, and, trousers, and, play, the, role, of, devotees, to, the, buddha, as, well, as, the, bodhisattva, and, future, buddha, maitreya, according, to, benjamin, rowland, the, first, expression, of, kushan, art, appears, at, khalchayan, at, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, it, is, derived, from, hellenistic, art, and, possibly, from, the, art, of, the, cities, of, ai, khanoum, and, nysa, and, clearly, has, similarities, with, the, later, art, of, gandhara, and, may, even, have, been, at, the, origin, of, its, development, rowland, particularly, draws, attention, to, the, similarity, of, the, ethnic, types, represented, at, khalchayan, and, in, the, art, of, gandhara, and, also, in, the, style, of, portraiture, itself, for, example, rowland, find, a, great, proximity, between, the, famous, head, of, a, yuezhi, prince, from, khalchayan, and, the, head, of, gandharan, bodhisattvas, giving, the, example, of, the, gandharan, head, of, a, bodhisattva, in, the, philadelphia, museum, of, art, the, similarity, of, the, gandhara, bodhisattva, with, the, portrait, of, the, kushan, ruler, heraios, is, also, striking, according, to, rowland, the, bactrian, art, of, khalchayan, thus, survived, for, several, centuries, through, its, influence, in, the, art, of, gandhara, thanks, to, the, patronage, of, the, kushans, during, the, kushan, empire, many, images, of, gandhara, share, a, strong, resemblance, to, the, features, of, greek, syrian, persian, and, indian, figures, these, western, looking, stylistic, signatures, often, include, heavy, drapery, and, curly, hair, representing, a, composite, the, greeks, for, example, often, possessed, curly, hair, as, the, kushans, took, control, of, the, area, of, mathura, as, well, the, art, of, mathura, developed, considerably, and, free, standing, statues, of, the, buddha, came, to, be, mass, produced, around, this, time, possibly, encouraged, by, doctrinal, changes, in, buddhism, allowing, to, depart, from, the, aniconism, that, had, prevailed, in, the, buddhist, sculptures, at, mathura, bharhut, or, sanchi, from, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, artistic, cultural, influence, of, kushans, declined, slowly, due, to, hellenistic, greek, and, indian, influences, the, kushans, used, gold, ingots, as, part, of, their, monetary, system, as, shown, by, the, gold, treasure, discovered, in, 1972, in, dalverzin, tepe, the, main, objects, from, the, treasure, were, circular, and, parallelepipedic, ingots, followed, by, various, decorative, objects, and, jewellery, items, the, circular, ingots, used, to, be, progressively, cut, up, as, needed, depending, on, the, amount, required, for, a, transaction, on, the, contrary, the, parallelepipedic, ingots, were, used, to, stock, wealth, in, a, not, divisible, form, these, ingots, bear, inscriptions, in, kharoshthi, mentioning, their, weight, and, the, god, mitra, protector, of, contractual, relations, these, ingots, are, all, attributed, to, the, monetary, system, of, the, kushan, empire, the, coinage, of, the, kushans, was, abundant, and, an, important, tool, of, propaganda, in, promoting, each, kushan, ruler, one, of, the, names, for, kushan, coins, was, dinara, which, ultimately, came, from, the, roman, name, denarius, aureus, the, coinage, of, the, kushans, was, copied, as, far, as, the, kushano, sasanians, in, the, west, and, the, kingdom, of, samatata, in, bengal, to, the, east, the, coinage, of, the, gupta, empire, was, also, initially, derived, from, the, coinage, of, the, kushan, empire, adopting, its, weight, standard, techniques, and, designs, following, the, conquests, of, samudragupta, in, the, northwest, the, imagery, on, gupta, coins, then, became, more, indian, in, both, style, and, subject, matter, compared, to, earlier, dynasties, where, greco, roman, and, persian, styles, were, mostly, followed, it, has, long, been, suggested, that, the, gold, contained, in, kushan, coins, was, ultimately, of, roman, origin, and, that, roman, coins, were, imported, as, a, consequence, of, trade, and, melted, in, india, to, mint, kushan, coins, however, a, recent, archaeometallurgical, study, of, trace, elements, through, proton, activation, analysis, has, shown, that, kushan, gold, contains, high, concentrations, of, platinum, and, palladium, which, rules, out, the, hypothesis, of, a, roman, provenance, to, this, day, the, origin, of, kushan, gold, remains, unknown, several, roman, sources, describe, the, visit, of, ambassadors, from, the, kings, of, bactria, and, india, during, the, 2nd, century, probably, referring, to, the, kushans, historia, augusta, speaking, of, emperor, hadrian, 117, 138, tells, reges, bactrianorum, legatos, ad, eum, amicitiae, petendae, causa, supplices, miserunt, the, kings, of, the, bactrians, sent, supplicant, ambassadors, to, him, to, seek, his, friendship, also, in, 138, according, to, aurelius, victor, epitome, xv, 4, and, appian, praef, 7, antoninus, pius, successor, to, hadrian, received, some, indian, bactrian, and, hyrcanian, ambassadors, some, kushan, coins, have, an, effigy, of, roma, suggesting, a, strong, level, of, awareness, and, some, level, of, diplomatic, relations, the, summer, capital, of, the, kushan, empire, in, begram, has, yielded, a, considerable, amount, of, goods, imported, from, the, roman, empire, in, particular, various, types, of, glassware, the, chinese, described, the, presence, of, roman, goods, in, the, kushan, realm, precious, things, from, da, qin, can, be, found, there, as, well, as, fine, cotton, cloths, fine, wool, carpets, perfumes, of, all, sorts, sugar, candy, pepper, ginger, and, black, salt, parthamaspates, of, parthia, a, client, of, rome, and, ruler, of, the, kingdom, of, osroene, is, known, to, have, traded, with, the, kushan, empire, goods, being, sent, by, sea, and, through, the, indus, river, during, the, 1st, and, 2nd, century, ad, the, kushan, empire, expanded, militarily, to, the, north, putting, them, at, the, center, of, the, profitable, central, asian, commerce, they, are, related, to, have, collaborated, militarily, with, the, chinese, against, nomadic, incursion, particularly, when, they, allied, with, the, han, dynasty, general, ban, chao, against, the, sogdians, in, 84, when, the, latter, were, trying, to, support, a, revolt, by, the, king, of, kashgar, around, 85, they, also, assisted, the, chinese, general, in, an, attack, on, turpan, east, of, the, tarim, basin, in, recognition, for, their, support, to, the, chinese, the, kushans, requested, a, han, princess, but, were, denied, even, after, they, had, sent, presents, to, the, chinese, court, in, retaliation, they, marched, on, ban, chao, in, 86, with, a, force, of, 70, 000, but, were, defeated, by, a, smaller, chinese, force, the, yuezhi, retreated, and, paid, tribute, to, the, chinese, empire, during, the, reign, of, emperor, he, of, han, 89, 106, the, kushans, are, again, recorded, to, have, sent, presents, to, the, chinese, court, in, 158, 159, during, the, reign, of, emperor, huan, of, han, following, these, interactions, cultural, exchanges, further, increased, and, kushan, buddhist, missionaries, such, as, lokaksema, became, active, in, the, chinese, capital, cities, of, luoyang, and, sometimes, nanjing, where, they, particularly, distinguished, themselves, by, their, translation, work, they, were, the, first, recorded, promoters, of, hinayana, and, mahayana, scriptures, in, china, greatly, contributing, to, the, silk, road, transmission, of, buddhism, after, the, death, of, vasudeva, i, in, 225, the, kushan, empire, split, into, western, and, eastern, halves, the, western, kushans, in, afghanistan, were, soon, subjugated, by, the, persian, sasanian, empire, and, lost, sogdiana, bactria, and, gandhara, to, them, the, sassanian, king, shapur, i, 240, 270, claims, in, his, naqsh, e, rostam, inscription, possession, of, the, territory, of, the, kushans, k, n, ahr, as, far, as, purushapura, peshawar, suggesting, he, controlled, bactria, and, areas, as, far, as, the, hindu, kush, or, even, south, of, it, i, the, mazda, worshipping, lord, shapur, king, of, kings, of, iran, and, an, iran, i, am, the, master, of, the, domain, of, iran, r, n, ahr, and, possess, the, territory, of, persis, parthian, hindestan, the, domain, of, the, kushan, up, to, the, limits, of, pa, kabur, and, up, to, kash, sughd, and, chachestan, this, is, also, confirmed, by, the, rag, i, bibi, inscription, in, modern, afghanistan, the, sasanians, deposed, the, western, dynasty, and, replaced, them, with, persian, vassals, known, as, the, kushanshas, in, bactrian, on, their, coinage, k, an, a, koshano, shao, also, called, indo, sasanians, or, kushano, sasanians, the, kushano, sasanians, ultimately, became, very, powerful, under, hormizd, i, kushanshah, 277, 286, and, rebelled, against, the, sasanian, empire, while, continuing, many, aspects, of, the, kushan, culture, visible, in, particular, in, their, titulature, and, their, coinage, the, eastern, kushan, kingdom, also, known, as, the, little, kushans, was, based, in, the, punjab, around, 270, their, territories, on, the, gangetic, plain, became, independent, under, local, dynasties, such, as, the, yaudheyas, then, in, the, mid, 4th, century, they, were, subjugated, by, the, gupta, empire, under, samudragupta, in, his, inscription, on, the, allahabad, pillar, samudragupta, proclaims, that, the, d, vaputra, sh, hi, sh, h, nush, hi, referring, to, the, last, kushan, rulers, being, a, deformation, of, the, kushan, regnal, titles, devaputra, shao, and, shaonanoshao, son, of, god, king, king, of, kings, are, now, under, his, dominion, and, that, they, were, forced, to, self, surrender, offering, their, own, daughters, in, marriage, and, a, request, for, the, administration, of, their, own, districts, and, provinces, this, suggests, that, by, the, time, of, the, allahabad, inscription, the, kushans, still, ruled, in, punjab, but, under, the, suzerainty, of, the, gupta, emperor, numimastics, indicate, that, the, coinage, of, the, eastern, kushans, was, much, weakened, silver, coinage, was, abandoned, altogether, and, gold, coinage, was, debased, this, suggests, that, the, eastern, kushans, had, lost, their, central, trading, role, on, the, trade, routes, that, supplied, luxury, goods, and, gold, still, the, buddhist, art, of, gandhara, continued, to, flourish, and, cities, such, as, sirsukh, near, taxila, were, established, in, the, east, around, 350, shapur, ii, regained, the, upper, hand, against, the, kushano, sasanian, kingdom, and, took, control, of, large, territories, in, areas, now, known, as, afghanistan, and, pakistan, possibly, as, a, consequence, of, the, destruction, of, the, kushano, sasanians, by, the, chionites, the, kushano, sasanian, still, ruled, in, the, north, important, finds, of, sasanian, coinage, beyond, the, indus, river, in, the, city, of, taxila, only, start, with, the, reigns, of, shapur, ii, r, 309, 379, and, shapur, iii, r, 383, 388, suggesting, that, the, expansion, of, sasanian, control, beyond, the, indus, was, the, result, of, the, wars, of, shapur, ii, with, the, chionites, and, kushans, in, 350, 358, as, described, by, ammianus, marcellinus, they, probably, maintained, control, until, the, rise, of, the, kidarites, under, their, ruler, kidara, in, 360, a, kidarite, hun, named, kidara, overthrew, the, kushano, sasanians, and, remnants, of, the, old, kushan, dynasty, and, established, the, kidarite, kingdom, the, kushan, style, of, kidarite, coins, indicates, they, claimed, kushan, heritage, the, kidarite, seem, to, have, been, rather, prosperous, although, on, a, smaller, scale, than, their, kushan, predecessors, east, of, the, punjab, the, former, eastern, territories, of, the, kushans, were, controlled, by, the, mighty, gupta, empire, the, remnants, of, kushan, culture, under, the, kidarites, in, the, northwest, were, ultimately, wiped, out, in, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, by, the, invasions, of, the, alchon, huns, sometimes, considered, as, a, branch, of, the, hephthalites, and, later, the, nezak, huns, one, of, the, most, recent, list, of, rulers, with, dates, is, as, follows, jayadaman, rudradaman, i, damajadasri, i, jivadaman, rudrasimha, i, isvaradatta,
