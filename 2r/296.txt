their, lands, specifically, che, mno, land, and, later, the, polish, lands, of, pomerelia, also, pomorze, gda, skie, or, pomerania, kuyavia, and, dobrzy, land, the, order, theoretically, lost, its, main, purpose, in, europe, with, the, christianization, of, lithuania, however, it, initiated, numerous, campaigns, against, its, christian, neighbours, the, kingdom, of, poland, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, the, novgorod, republic, after, assimilating, the, livonian, order, the, teutonic, knights, had, a, strong, economic, base, which, enabled, them, to, hire, mercenaries, from, throughout, europe, to, augment, their, feudal, levies, and, they, also, became, a, naval, power, in, the, baltic, sea, in, 1410, a, polish, lithuanian, army, decisively, defeated, the, order, and, broke, its, military, power, at, the, battle, of, grunwald, however, the, knights, successfully, defended, their, capital, in, the, following, siege, of, marienburg, malbork, and, the, order, was, saved, from, collapse, in, 1515, holy, roman, emperor, maximilian, i, made, a, marriage, alliance, with, sigismund, i, of, poland, lithuania, thereafter, the, empire, did, not, support, the, order, against, poland, in, 1525, grand, master, albert, of, brandenburg, resigned, and, converted, to, lutheranism, becoming, duke, of, prussia, as, a, vassal, of, poland, soon, after, the, order, lost, livonia, and, its, holdings, in, the, protestant, areas, of, germany, the, order, did, keep, its, considerable, holdings, in, catholic, areas, of, germany, until, 1809, when, napoleon, bonaparte, ordered, its, dissolution, and, the, order, lost, its, last, secular, holdings, however, the, order, continued, to, exist, as, a, charitable, and, ceremonial, body, it, was, outlawed, by, nazi, germany, in, 1938, but, re, established, in, 1945, today, it, operates, primarily, with, charitable, aims, in, central, europe, the, knights, wore, white, surcoats, with, a, black, cross, a, cross,

the, motto, of, the, order, was, helfen, wehren, heilen, help, defend, heal, in, 1143, pope, celestine, ii, ordered, the, knights, hospitaller, to, take, over, management, of, a, german, hospital, in, jerusalem, which, according, to, the, chronicler, jean, d, ypres, accommodated, the, countless, german, pilgrims, and, crusaders, who, could, neither, speak, the, local, language, nor, latin, patri, linguam, ignorantibus, atque, latinam, although, formally, an, institution, of, the, hospitallers, the, pope, commanded, that, the, prior, and, the, brothers, of, the, domus, theutonicorum, house, of, the, germans, should, always, be, germans, themselves, so, a, tradition, of, a, german, led, religious, institution, could, develop, during, the, 12th, century, in, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, after, the, loss, of, jerusalem, in, 1187, some, merchants, from, l, beck, and, bremen, took, up, the, idea, and, founded, a, field, hospital, for, the, duration, of, the, siege, of, acre, in, 1190, which, became, the, nucleus, of, the, order, pope, celestine, iii, recognized, it, in, 1192, by, granting, the, monks, augustinian, rule, however, based, on, the, model, of, the, knights, templar, it, was, transformed, into, a, military, order, in, 1198, and, the, head, of, the, order, became, known, as, the, grand, master, magister, hospitalis, it, received, papal, orders, for, crusades, to, take, and, hold, jerusalem, for, christianity, and, defend, the, holy, land, against, the, muslim, saracens, during, the, rule, of, grand, master, hermann, von, salza, 1209, 1239, the, order, changed, from, being, a, hospice, brotherhood, for, pilgrims, to, primarily, a, military, order, the, order, was, founded, in, acre, and, the, knights, purchased, montfort, castle, northeast, of, acre, in, 1220, this, castle, which, defended, the, route, between, jerusalem, and, the, mediterranean, sea, was, made, the, seat, of, the, grand, masters, in, 1229, although, they, returned, to, acre, after, losing, montfort, to, muslim, control, in, 1271, the, order, received, donations, of, land, in, the, holy, roman, empire, especially, in, present, day, germany, and, italy, frankokratia, and, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, frederick, ii, holy, roman, emperor, elevated, his, close, friend, hermann, von, salza, to, the, status, of, reichsf, rst, or, prince, of, the, empire, enabling, the, grand, master, to, negotiate, with, other, senior, princes, as, an, equal, during, frederick, s, coronation, as, king, of, jerusalem, in, 1225, teutonic, knights, served, as, his, escort, in, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, von, salza, read, the, emperor, s, proclamation, in, both, french, and, german, however, the, teutonic, knights, were, never, as, influential, in, outremer, as, the, older, knights, templar, and, knights, hospitaller, teutonic, order, domains, in, the, levant, in, 1211, andrew, ii, of, hungary, accepted, the, services, of, the, teutonic, knights, and, granted, them, the, district, of, burzenland, in, transylvania, where, they, would, be, exempt, from, fees, and, duties, and, could, administer, their, own, justice, andrew, had, been, involved, in, negotiations, for, the, marriage, of, his, daughter, with, the, son, of, hermann, landgrave, of, thuringia, whose, vassals, included, the, family, of, hermann, von, salza, led, by, a, brother, called, theoderich, or, dietrich, the, order, defended, the, south, eastern, borders, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, against, the, neighbouring, cumans, many, forts, of, wood, and, mud, were, built, for, defence, they, settled, new, german, peasants, among, the, existing, transylvanian, saxon, inhabitants, the, cumans, had, no, fixed, settlements, for, resistance, and, soon, the, teutons, were, expanding, into, their, territory, by, 1220, the, teutonics, knights, had, built, five, castles, some, of, them, made, of, stone, their, rapid, expansion, made, the, hungarian, nobility, and, clergy, who, were, previously, uninterested, in, those, regions, jealous, and, suspicious, some, nobles, claimed, these, lands, but, the, order, refused, to, share, them, ignoring, the, demands, of, the, local, bishop, after, the, fifth, crusade, king, andrew, returned, to, hungary, and, found, his, kingdom, full, of, resentment, because, of, the, expenses, and, losses, of, the, failed, military, campaign, when, the, nobles, demanded, that, he, cancel, the, concessions, made, to, the, knights, he, concluded, that, they, had, exceeded, their, task, and, that, the, agreement, should, be, revised, but, did, not, revert, the, concessions, however, prince, b, la, heir, to, the, throne, was, allied, with, the, nobility, in, 1224, the, teutonic, knights, seeing, that, they, would, have, problems, when, the, prince, inherited, the, kingdom, petitioned, pope, honorius, iii, to, be, placed, directly, under, the, authority, of, the, papal, see, rather, than, that, of, the, king, of, hungary, this, was, a, grave, mistake, as, king, andrew, angered, and, alarmed, at, their, growing, power, responded, in, 1225, by, expelling, the, teutonic, knights, although, he, allowed, the, ethnically, german, commoners, and, peasants, settled, here, by, the, order, to, remain, and, these, became, part, of, the, larger, group, of, the, transylvanian, saxons, lacking, the, military, organization, and, experience, of, the, teutonic, knights, the, hungarians, failed, to, replace, them, with, adequate, defence, against, the, attacking, cumans, soon, the, steppe, warriors, would, be, a, threat, again, in, 1226, konrad, i, duke, of, masovia, in, north, eastern, poland, appealed, to, the, knights, to, defend, his, borders, and, subdue, the, pagan, baltic, old, prussians, allowing, the, teutonic, knights, use, of, che, mno, land, as, a, base, for, their, campaign, this, being, a, time, of, widespread, crusading, fervor, throughout, western, europe, hermann, von, salza, considered, prussia, a, good, training, ground, for, his, knights, for, the, wars, against, the, muslims, in, outremer, with, the, golden, bull, of, rimini, emperor, frederick, ii, bestowed, on, the, order, a, special, imperial, privilege, for, the, conquest, and, possession, of, prussia, including, che, mno, land, with, nominal, papal, sovereignty, in, 1235, the, teutonic, knights, assimilated, the, smaller, order, of, dobrzy, which, had, been, established, earlier, by, christian, the, first, bishop, of, prussia, the, conquest, of, prussia, was, accomplished, with, much, bloodshed, over, more, than, fifty, years, during, which, native, prussians, who, remained, unbaptised, were, subjugated, killed, or, exiled, fighting, between, the, knights, and, the, prussians, was, ferocious, chronicles, of, the, order, state, the, prussians, would, roast, captured, brethren, alive, in, their, armour, like, chestnuts, before, the, shrine, of, a, local, god, the, native, nobility, who, submitted, to, the, crusaders, had, many, of, their, privileges, confirmed, by, the, treaty, of, christburg, after, the, prussian, uprisings, of, 1260, 83, however, much, of, the, prussian, nobility, emigrated, or, were, resettled, and, many, free, prussians, lost, their, rights, the, prussian, nobles, who, remained, were, more, closely, allied, with, the, german, landowners, and, were, gradually, assimilated, peasants, in, frontier, regions, such, as, samland, had, more, privileges, than, those, in, more, populated, lands, such, as, pomesania, the, crusading, knights, often, accepted, baptism, as, a, form, of, submission, by, the, natives, christianity, along, western, lines, slowly, spread, through, prussian, culture, bishops, were, reluctant, to, have, pagan, prussian, religious, practices, integrated, into, the, new, faith, while, the, ruling, knights, found, it, easier, to, govern, the, natives, when, they, were, semi, pagan, and, lawless, after, fifty, years, of, warfare, and, brutal, conquest, the, end, result, was, that, most, of, the, prussian, natives, were, either, killed, or, deported, the, order, ruled, prussia, under, charters, issued, by, the, pope, and, the, holy, roman, emperor, as, a, sovereign, monastic, state, comparable, to, the, arrangement, of, the, knights, hospitallers, in, rhodes, and, later, in, malta, to, make, up, for, losses, from, the, plague, and, to, replace, the, partially, exterminated, native, population, the, order, encouraged, immigration, from, the, holy, roman, empire, mostly, germans, flemish, and, dutch, and, from, masovia, poles, the, later, masurians, these, included, nobles, burghers, and, peasants, and, the, surviving, old, prussians, were, gradually, assimilated, through, germanization, the, settlers, founded, numerous, towns, and, cities, on, former, prussian, settlements, the, order, itself, built, a, number, of, castles, ordensburgen, from, which, it, could, defeat, uprisings, of, old, prussians, as, well, as, continue, its, attacks, on, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, the, kingdom, of, poland, with, which, the, order, was, often, at, war, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, major, towns, founded, by, the, order, included, thorn, toru, kulm, che, mno, allenstein, olsztyn, elbing, elbl, g, memel, klaip, da, and, k, nigsberg, founded, in, 1255, in, honor, of, king, otakar, ii, of, bohemia, on, the, site, of, a, destroyed, prussian, settlement, after, suffering, a, devastating, defeat, in, the, battle, of, saule, the, livonian, brothers, of, the, sword, were, absorbed, by, the, teutonic, knights, in, 1237, the, livonian, branch, subsequently, became, known, as, the, livonian, order, attempts, to, expand, into, rus, failed, when, the, knights, suffered, a, major, defeat, in, 1242, in, the, battle, of, the, ice, at, the, hands, of, prince, alexander, nevsky, of, novgorod, over, the, next, decades, the, order, focused, on, the, subjugation, of, the, curonians, and, semigallians, in, 1260, it, suffered, a, disastrous, defeat, in, the, battle, of, durbe, against, samogitians, and, this, inspired, rebellions, throughout, prussia, and, livonia, after, the, knights, won, a, crucial, victory, in, the, siege, of, k, nigsberg, from, 1262, to, 1265, the, war, had, reached, a, turning, point, the, curonians, were, finally, subjugated, in, 1267, and, the, semigallians, in, 1290, the, order, suppressed, a, major, estonian, rebellion, in, 1343, 1345, and, in, 1346, purchased, the, duchy, of, estonia, from, denmark, the, teutonic, knights, began, to, direct, their, campaigns, against, pagan, lithuania, see, lithuanian, mythology, due, to, the, long, existing, conflicts, in, the, region, including, constant, incursions, into, the, holy, roman, empire, s, territory, by, pagan, raiding, parties, and, the, lack, of, a, proper, area, of, operation, for, the, knights, after, the, fall, of, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, at, acre, in, 1291, and, their, later, expulsion, from, hungary, at, first, the, knights, moved, their, headquarters, to, venice, from, which, they, planned, the, recovery, of, outremer, this, plan, was, however, soon, abandoned, and, the, order, later, moved, its, headquarters, to, marienburg, so, it, could, better, focus, its, efforts, on, the, region, of, prussia, because, lithuania, propria, remained, non, christian, until, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, much, later, than, the, rest, of, eastern, europe, the, conflicts, were, dragged, out, over, a, longer, time, and, many, knights, from, western, european, countries, such, as, england, and, france, journeyed, to, prussia, to, participate, in, the, seasonal, campaigns, reyse, against, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, in, 1348, the, order, won, a, great, victory, over, the, lithuanians, in, the, battle, of, str, va, severely, weakening, them, in, 1370, it, won, a, decisive, victory, over, lithuania, in, the, battle, of, rudau, warfare, between, the, order, and, the, lithuanians, was, particularly, brutal, it, was, common, practice, for, lithuanians, to, torture, captured, enemies, and, civilians, it, is, recorded, by, a, teutonic, chronicler, that, they, had, the, habit, of, tying, captured, knights, to, their, horses, and, having, both, of, them, burned, alive, while, sometimes, a, stake, would, be, driven, into, their, bodies, or, the, knight, would, be, flayed, lithuanian, pagan, customs, included, ritualistic, human, sacrifice, the, hanging, of, widows, and, the, burying, of, a, warrior, s, horses, and, servants, with, him, after, his, death, the, knights, would, also, on, occasion, take, captives, from, defeated, lithuanians, whose, condition, as, that, of, other, war, captives, in, the, middle, ages, was, extensively, researched, by, jacques, heers, the, conflict, had, much, influence, in, the, political, situation, of, the, region, and, was, the, source, of, many, rivalries, between, lithuanians, or, poles, and, germans, the, degree, to, which, it, impacted, the, mentalities, of, the, time, can, be, seen, in, the, lyrical, works, of, men, such, as, the, contemporary, austrian, poet, peter, suchenwirt, overall, the, conflict, lasted, over, 200, years, although, with, varying, degrees, of, active, hostility, during, that, time, its, front, line, extending, along, both, banks, of, the, neman, river, with, as, many, as, twenty, forts, and, castles, between, sered, ius, and, jurbarkas, alone, a, dispute, over, the, succession, to, the, duchy, of, pomerelia, embroiled, the, order, in, further, conflict, at, the, beginning, of, the, 14th, century, the, margraves, of, brandenburg, had, claims, to, the, duchy, which, they, asserted, after, the, death, of, king, wenceslaus, of, poland, in, 1306, duke, w, adys, aw, i, the, elbow, high, of, poland, also, claimed, the, duchy, based, on, inheritance, from, przemys, aw, ii, but, he, was, opposed, by, some, pomeranians, nobles, they, requested, help, from, brandenburg, which, subsequently, occupied, all, of, pomerelia, except, for, the, citadel, of, gda, sk, in, 1308, because, w, adys, aw, was, unable, to, come, to, the, defense, of, gda, sk, the, teutonic, knights, then, led, by, grand, master, siegfried, von, feuchtwangen, were, called, to, expel, the, brandenburgers, the, order, under, a, prussian, landmeister, heinrich, von, pl, tzke, evicted, the, brandenburgers, from, gda, sk, in, september, 1308, but, then, refused, to, yield, the, town, to, the, poles, and, according, to, some, sources, massacred, the, town, s, inhabitants, although, the, exact, extent, of, the, violence, is, unknown, and, widely, recognized, by, historians, to, be, an, unsolvable, mystery, the, estimates, range, from, 60, rebellious, leaders, reported, by, dignitaries, of, the, region, and, knight, chroniclers, to, 10, 000, civilians, a, number, cited, in, a, papal, bull, of, dubious, provenance, that, was, used, in, a, legal, process, installed, to, punish, the, order, for, the, event, the, legal, dispute, went, on, for, a, time, but, the, order, was, eventually, absolved, of, the, charges, in, the, treaty, of, soldin, the, teutonic, order, purchased, brandenburg, s, supposed, claim, to, the, castles, of, gda, sk, wiecie, and, tczew, and, their, hinterlands, from, the, margraves, for, 10, 000, marks, on, 13, september, 1309, control, of, pomerelia, allowed, the, order, to, connect, their, monastic, state, with, the, borders, of, the, holy, roman, empire, crusading, reinforcements, and, supplies, could, travel, from, the, imperial, territory, of, hither, pomerania, through, pomerelia, to, prussia, while, poland, s, access, to, the, baltic, sea, was, blocked, while, poland, had, mostly, been, an, ally, of, the, knights, against, the, pagan, prussians, and, lithuanians, the, capture, of, pomerelia, turned, the, kingdom, into, a, determined, enemy, of, the, order, the, capture, of, gda, sk, marked, a, new, phase, in, the, history, of, the, teutonic, knights, the, persecution, and, abolition, of, the, powerful, knights, templar, which, began, in, 1307, worried, the, teutonic, knights, but, control, of, pomerelia, allowed, them, to, move, their, headquarters, in, 1309, from, venice, to, marienburg, malbork, on, the, nogat, river, outside, the, reach, of, secular, powers, the, position, of, prussian, landmeister, was, merged, with, that, of, the, grand, master, the, pope, began, investigating, misconduct, by, the, knights, but, no, charges, were, found, to, have, substance, along, with, the, campaigns, against, the, lithuanians, the, knights, faced, a, vengeful, poland, and, legal, threats, from, the, papacy, the, treaty, of, kalisz, of, 1343, ended, the, open, war, between, the, teutonic, knights, and, poland, the, knights, relinquished, kuyavia, and, dobrzy, land, to, poland, but, retained, che, mno, land, and, pomerelia, with, gda, sk, germanized, as, danzig, in, 1236, the, knights, of, saint, thomas, an, english, order, adopted, the, rules, of, the, teutonic, order, a, contingent, of, teutonic, knights, of, indeterminate, number, is, traditionally, believed, to, have, participated, at, the, battle, of, legnica, in, 1241, during, the, first, mongol, invasion, of, poland, the, combined, polish, german, army, was, crushed, by, the, mongol, army, and, their, superior, tactics, with, few, survivors, in, 1337, emperor, louis, iv, allegedly, granted, the, order, the, imperial, privilege, to, conquer, all, lithuania, and, russia, during, the, reign, of, grand, master, winrich, von, kniprode, 1351, 1382, the, order, reached, the, peak, of, its, international, prestige, and, hosted, numerous, european, crusaders, and, nobility, king, albert, of, sweden, ceded, gotland, to, the, order, as, a, pledge, similar, to, a, fiefdom, with, the, understanding, that, they, would, eliminate, the, pirating, victual, brothers, from, this, strategic, island, base, in, the, baltic, sea, an, invasion, force, under, grand, master, konrad, von, jungingen, conquered, the, island, in, 1398, and, drove, the, victual, brothers, out, of, gotland, and, the, baltic, sea, in, 1386, grand, duke, jogaila, of, lithuania, was, baptised, into, christianity, and, married, queen, jadwiga, of, poland, taking, the, name, w, adys, aw, ii, jagie, o, and, becoming, king, of, poland, this,

from, 1524, to, 1525, and, subsequently, confiscated, by, protestant, territorial, princes, the, livonian, territory, was, then, partitioned, by, neighboring, powers, during, the, livonian, war, in, 1561, the, livonian, master, gotthard, kettler, secularized, the, southern, livonian, possessions, of, the, order, to, create, the, duchy, of, courland, also, a, vassal, of, poland, after, the, loss, of, prussia, in, 1525, the, teutonic, knights, concentrated, on, their, possessions, in, the, holy, roman, empire, since, they, held, no, contiguous, territory, they, developed, a, three, tiered, administrative, system, holdings, were, combined, into, commanderies, that, were, administered, by, a, commander, komtur, several, commanderies, were, combined, to, form, a, bailiwick, headed, by, a, landkomtur, all, of, the, teutonic, knights, possessions, were, subordinate, to, the, grand, master, whose, seat, was, in, bad, mergentheim, there, were, twelve, german, bailiwicks, outside, of, german, areas, were, the, bailiwicks, of, the, order, gradually, lost, control, of, these, holdings, until, by, 1809, only, the, seat, of, the, grand, master, at, mergentheim, remained, following, the, abdication, of, albert, of, brandenburg, walter, von, cronberg, became, deutschmeister, in, 1527, and, later, administrator, of, prussia, and, grand, master, in, 1530, emperor, charles, v,

mergentheim, in, w, rttemberg, which, was, attacked, during, the, german, peasants, war, the, order, also, helped, charles, v, against, the, schmalkaldic, league, after, the, peace, of, augsburg, in, 1555, membership, in, the, order, was, open, to, protestants, although, the, majority, of, brothers, remained, catholic, the, teutonic, knights, became, tri, denominational, with, catholic, lutheran, and, reformed, bailiwicks, the, grand, masters, often, members, of, the, great, german, families, and, after, 1761, members, of, the, house, of, habsburg, lorraine, continued, to, preside, over, the, order, s, considerable, holdings, in, germany, teutonic, knights, from, germany, austria, and, bohemia, were, used, as, battlefield, commanders, leading, mercenaries, for, the, habsburg, monarchy, during, the, ottoman, wars, in, europe, the, military, history, of, the, teutonic, knights, was, to, end, in, 1805, by, the, article, xii, of, the, peace, of, pressburg, which, ordered, the, german, territories, of, the, knights, converted, into, a, hereditary, domain, and, gave, the, austrian, emperor, responsibility, for, placing, a, habsburg, prince, on, its, throne, these, terms, had, not, been, fulfilled, by, the, time, of, the, treaty, of, sch, nbrunn, in, 1809, and, therefore, napoleon, bonaparte, ordered, the, knights, remaining, territory, to, be, disbursed, to, his, german, allies, which, was, completed, in, 1810, the, generalkapitel, general, chapter, was, the, collection, of, all, the, priests, knights, and, half, brothers, german, halbbr, der, because, of, the, logistical, problems, in, assembling, the, members, who, were, spread, over, large, distances, only, deputations, of, the, bailiwicks, and, commandries, gathered, to, form, the, general, chapter, the, general, chapter, was, designed, to, meet, annually, but, the, conventions, were, usually, limited, to, the, election, of, a, new, grandmaster, the, decisions, of, the, generalkapitel, had, a, binding, effect, on, the, gro, gebietigers, of, the, order, the, hochmeister, grand, master, was, the, highest, officer, of, the, order, until, 1525, he, was, elected, by, the, generalkapitel, he, had, the, rank, of, the, ruler, of, an, ecclesiastic, imperial, state, and, was, sovereign, prince, of, prussia, until, 1466, despite, this, high, formal, position, in, practice, he, was, only, a, kind, of, first, among, equals, the, gro, gebietige, were, high, officers, with, competence, on, the, whole, order, appointed, by, the, hochmeister, there, were, five, offices, the, order, was, divided, into, three, national, chapters, prussia, livland, and, the, territory, of, the, holy, roman, empire, of, the, german, nation, the, highest, officer, of, each, chapter, was, the, landmeister, country, master, they, were, elected, by, the, regional, chapters, in, the, beginning, they, were, only, substitutes, of, the, grandmaster, but, were, able, to, create, a, power, of, their, own, so, that, within, their, territory, the, grandmaster, could, not, decide, against, their, will, at, the, end, of, their, rule, over, prussia, the, grandmaster, was, only, landmeister, of, prussia, there, were, three, landmeisters, because, the, properties, of, the, order, within, the, rule, of, the, deutschmeister, did, not, form, a, contiguous, territory, but, were, spread, over, the, whole, empire, and, parts, of, europe, there, was, an, additional, regional, structure, the, bailiwick, kammerballeien, chamber, bailiwicks, were, governed, by, the, grandmaster, himself, some, of, these, bailiwicks, had, the, rank, of, imperial, states, the, smallest, administrative, unit, of, the, order, was, the, kommende, it, was, ruled, by, a, komtur, who, had, all, administrative, rights, and, controlled, the, vogteien, district, of, a, reeve, and, zehnth, fe, tithe, collectors, within, his, rule, in, the, commandry, all, kinds, of, brothers, lived, together, in, a, monastic, way, noblemen, served, as, knight, brothers, or, priest, brothers, other, people, could, serve, as, sariantbrothers, who, were, armed, soldiers, and, as, half, brothers, who, were, working, in, the, economy, and, healthcare, the, catholic, order, continued, to, exist, in, the, various, territories, ruled, by, the, austrian, empire, out, of, napoleon, s, reach, from, 1804, the, order, was, headed, by, members, of, the, habsburg, dynasty, the, collapse, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, and, the, empire, it, governed, in, austria, the, italian, tyrol, bohemia, and, the, balkans, brought, a, shattering, crisis, to, the, order, while, in, the, new, austrian, republic, the, order, seemed, to, have, some, hope, of, survival, in, the, other, former, parts, of, the, habsburg, territories, the, tendency, was, to, regard, the, order, as, an, honorary, chivalric, order, of, the, house, of, habsburg, the, consequence, of, this, risked, being, the, confiscation, of, the, order, s, property, as, belongings, of, the, house, of, habsburg, so, as, to, make, the, distinction, clearer, in, 1923, the, then, high, master, field, marshal, eugen, of, austria, teschen, archduke, of, austria, a, member, of, the, house, of, habsburg, and, an, active, army, commander, before, and, during, the, first, world, war, had, one, of, the, order, s, priests, norbert, klein, at, the, time, bishop, of, brno, br, nn, elected, his, coadjutor, and, then, abdicated, leaving, the, bishop, as, high, master, of, the, order, as, a, result, of, this, move, by, 1928, the, now, independent, former, habsburg, territories, all, recognized, the, order, as, a, catholic, religious, order, the, order, itself, introduced, a, new, rule, approved, by, pope, pius, xi, in, 1929, according, to, which, the, government, of, the, order, would, in, the, future, be, in, the, hands, of, a, priest, of, the, order, as, would, its, constituent, provinces, while, the, women, religious, of, the, order, would, have, women, superiors, in, 1936, the, situation, of, the, women, religious, was, further, clarified, and, the, congregation, of, the, sisters, of, the, order, was, given, as, their, supreme, moderator, the, high, master, of, the, order, the, sisters, also, having, representation, at, the, order, s, general, chapter, this, completed, the, transformation, of, what, remained, in, the, catholic, church, of, the, teutonic, knights, into, a, catholic, religious, order, now, renamed, simply, the, deutscher, orden, german, order, however, further, difficulties, were, in, store, the, promising, beginnings, of, this, reorganization, and, spiritual, transformation, suffered, a, severe, blow, through, the, expansion, of, german, might, under, the, national, socialist, regime, after, austria, s, annexation, by, germany, in, 1938, and, similarly, the, czech, lands, in, 1939, the, teutonic, order, was, suppressed, throughout, the, gro, deutsches, reich, until, germany, s, defeat, this, did, not, prevent, the, national, socialists, from, using, imagery, of, the, medieval, teutonic, knights, for, propagandistic, purposes, the, fascist, rule, in, italy, which, since, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, had, absorbed, the, southern, tyrol, was, not, a, propitious, setting, but, following, the, end, of, hostilities, a, now, democratic, italy, provided, normalized, conditions, in, 1947, austria, legally, abolished, the, measures, taken, against, the, order, and, restored, confiscated, property, despite, being, hampered, by, the, communist, regimes, in, yugoslavia, and, in, czechoslovakia, the, order, was, now, broadly, in, a, position, to, take, up, activities, in, accordance, with, elements, of, its, tradition, including, care, for, the, sick, for, the, elderly, for, children, including, work, in, education, in, parishes, and, in, its, own, internal, houses, of, study, in, 1957, a, residence, was, established, in, rome, for, the, order, s, procurator, general, to, the, holy, see, to, serve, also, as, a, pilgrim, hostel, conditions, in, czechoslovakia, gradually, improved, and, in, the, meanwhile, the, forced, exile, of, some, members, of, the, order, led, to, the, order, s, re, establishing, itself, with, some, modest, but, historically, significant, foundations, in, germany, the, sisters, in, particular, gained, several, footholds, including, specialist, schools, and, care, of, the, poor, and, in, 1953, the, former, house, of, augustinian, canons, st, nikola, in, passau, became, the, sisters, motherhouse, although, the, reconstruction, represented, by, the, reformed, rule, of, 1929, had, set, aside, categories, such, as, the, knights, over, time, the, spontaneous, involvement, of, laypeople, in, the, order, s, apostolates, has, led, to, their, revival, in, a, modernized, form, a, development, formalized, by, pope, paul, vi, in, 1965, with, the, official, title, of, brethren, of, the, german, house, of, st, mary, in, jerusalem, the, order, today, is, unambiguously, a, catholic, religious, order, though, sui, generis, various, features, of, its, life, and, activities, recall, those, of, monastic, and, mendicant, orders, at, its, core, are, priests, who, make, a, solemn, religious, profession, along, with, lay, brothers, who, make, a, perpetual, simple, profession, also, part, of, the, order, are, the, sisters, with, internal, self, government, within, their, own, structures, but, with, representation, in, the, order, s, general, chapter, their, ultimate, superior, is, the, high, master, of, the, order, the, approximately, 100, catholic, priests, and, 200, nuns, of, the, order, are, divided, into, five, provinces, namely, austria, southern, tyrol, italy, slovenia, germany, czech, republic, and, slovakia, while, the, priests, predominantly, provide, spiritual, guidance, the, nuns, primarily, care, for, the, ill, and, the, aged, many, of, the, priests, care, for, german, speaking, communities, outside, of, germany, and, austria, especially, in, italy, and, slovenia, in, this, sense, the, teutonic, order, has, returned, to, its, 12th, century, roots, the, spiritual, and, physical, care, of, germans, in, foreign, lands, there, is, an, institute, of, familiares, most, of, whom, are, laypeople, and, who, are, attached, by, spiritual, bonds, to, the, order, but, do, not, take, vows, the, familiares, are, grouped, especially, into, the, bailiwicks, of, germany, austria, southern, tyrol, ad, tiberim, rome, and, the, bailiwick, of, the, czech, republic, and, slovakia, as, also, in, the, independent, commandry, of, alden, biesen, in, belgium, though, others, are, dispersed, throughout, the, world, overall, there, are, in, recent, years, some, 700, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, then, this, religious, order, had, developed, into, a, charitable, organization, and, established, numerous, clinics, as, well, as, sponsoring, excavation, and, tourism, projects, in, israel, in, 2000, the, german, chapter, of, the, teutonic, order, declared, bankruptcy, and, its, upper, management, was, dismissed, an, investigation, by, a, special, committee, of, the, bavarian, parliament, in, 2002, and, 2003, to, determine, the, cause, was, inconclusive, the, current, abbot, general, of, the, order, who, also, holds, the, title, of, high, master, is, father, frank, bayard, the, current, seat, of, the, high, master, is, the, church, of, the, german, order, deutschordenskirche, in, vienna, near, the, st, stephen, s, cathedral, stephansdom, in, the, austrian, capital, is, the, treasury, of, the, teutonic, order, which, is, open, to, the, public, and, the, order, s, central, archive, since, 1996, there, has, also, been, a, museum, dedicated, to, the, teutonic, knights, at, their, former, castle, in, bad, mergentheim, in, germany, which, was, the, seat, of, the, high, master, from, 1525, to, 1809, honorary, knights, of, the, teutonic, order, have, included, a, portion, of, the, order, retains, more, of, the, character, of, the, knights, during, the, height, of, its, power, and, prestige, der, balije, van, utrecht, bailiwick, of, utrecht, of, the, ridderlijke, duitsche, orde, chivalric, german, order, became, protestant, at, the, reformation, and, it, remained, an, aristocratic, society, the, relationship, of, the, bailiwick, of, utrecht, to, the, catholic, deutscher, orden, resembles, that, of, the, protestant, bailiwick, of, brandenburg, to, the, catholic, order, of, malta, each, is, an, authentic, part, of, its, original, order, though, differing, from, and, smaller, than, the, catholic, branch, the, knights, wore, white, surcoats, with, a, black, cross, granted, by, innocent, iii, in, 1205, a, cross, patt, e, was, sometimes, used, the, coat, of, arms, representing, the, grandmaster, hochmeisterwappen, is, shown, with, a, golden, cross, fleury, or, cross, potent, superimposed, on, the, black, cross, with, the, imperial, eagle, as, a, central, inescutcheon, the, golden, cross, fleury, overlaid, on, the, black, cross, became, widely, used, in, the, 15th, century, a, legendary, account, attributes, its, introduction, to, louis, ix, of, france, who, is, said, to, have, granted, the, master, of, the, order, this, cross, as, a, variation, of, the, jerusalem, cross, with, the, fleur, de, lis, symbol, attached, to, each, arm, in, 1250, while, this, legendary, account, cannot, be, traced, back, further, than, the, early, modern, period, christoph, hartknoch, 1684, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, design, does, indeed, date, to, the, mid, 13th, century, the, black, cross, patt, e, was, later, used, for, military, decoration, and, insignia, by, the, kingdom, of, prussia, and, germany, as, the, iron, cross, the, motto, of, the, order, is, helfen, wehren, heilen, to, help, to, defend, to, heal, emperor, wilhelm, ii, of, germany, posed, for, a, photo, in, 1902, in, the, garb, of, a, monk, from, the, teutonic, order, climbing, the, stairs, in, the, reconstructed, marienburg, castle, as, a, symbol, of, imperial, german, policy, the, german, historian, heinrich, von, treitschke, used, imagery, of, the, teutonic, knights, a, germanic, myth, to, promote, pro, german, and, anti, polish, rhetoric, many, middle, class, german, nationalists, adopted, this, imagery, and, its, symbols, during, the, weimar, republic, associations, and, organisations, of, this, nature, contributed, to, laying, the, groundwork, for, the, formation, of, nazi, germany, an, organization, predating, the, nazi, party, itself, as, well, as, nazi, supported, preceding, and, nazi, preceding, and, during, world, war, ii, propaganda, made, use, of, the, teutonic, knights, imagery, with, the, common, goal, of, instilling, the, importance, of, lebensraum, for, the, future, of, germany, and, the, german, people, according, to, medieval, historian, erik, christiansen, himmler, s, plan, to, mould, the, ss, as, a, reincarnation, of, proved, the, irresistible, strength, of, bad, history, though, gradually, taking, hold, ever, since, with, one, of, prince, adalbert, of, prussia, s, 1849, proposals, after, a, lull, during, the, weimar, republic, whereupon, it, reverted, to, a, simple, tricolor, overlayed, with, an, iron, cross, though, itself, also, derivative, a, version, of, germany, s, reichskriegsflagge, war, ensign, emerged, with, a, more, closely, resembling, the, state, of, the, teutonic, order, s, cross, s, original, shape, with, a, circle, overlaid, balkenkreuz, hitler, based, his, german, order, on, the, teutonic, order, while, especially, the, hochmeister, s, ceremonial, regalia, also, the, marian, cross, of, the, teutonic, order, the, knight, s, cross, of, the, iron, cross, and, of, the, cross, of, the, knight, of, justice, of, the, order, of, st, john, bailiwick, of, brandenburg, after, hitler, approved, the, generalplan, ost, gpo, germanization, campaigns, were, extolled, as, the, modern, adaptation, of, what, it, portrayed, as, civilizing, missions, of, the, teutonic, order, yet, despite, these, references, to, the, teutonic, order, s, history, in, nazi, propaganda, the, order, itself, was, abolished, in, 1938, and, its, members, were, persecuted, by, the, german, authorities, this, occurred, mostly, due, to, hitler, s, and, himmler, s, belief, that, throughout, history, catholic, military, religious, orders, had, been, tools, of, the, holy, see, and, as, such, constituted, a, threat, to, the, nazi, regime, the, converse, was, true, for, polish, nationalism, see, sienkiewicz, the, knights, of, the, cross, which, used, the, teutonic, knights, as, symbolic, shorthand, for, germans, in, general, conflating, the, two, into, an, easily, recognisable, image, of, the, hostile, similar, associations, were, used, by, soviet, propagandists, after, the, battle, of, grunwald, the, teutonic, order, was, portrayed, as, the, medieval, forerunners, of, hitler, s, armies, and, teutonic, knights, villains, in, the, 1938, sergei, eisenstein, film, aleksandr, nevskii, while, the, battle, itself, was, seen, as, the, medieval, counterpart, to, the, battle, of, stalingrad
