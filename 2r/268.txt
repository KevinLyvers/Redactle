executions, had, to, be, approved, beforehand, by, the, emperor, himself, these, were, relatively, few, considering, that, there, were, only, 24, executions, in, the, year, 730, xuanzong, bowed, to, the, consensus, of, his, ministers, on, policy, decisions, and, made, efforts, to, staff, government, ministries, fairly, with, different, political, factions, his, staunch, confucian, chancellor, zhang, jiuling, 673, 740, worked, to, reduce, deflation, and, increase, the, money, supply, by, upholding, the, use, of, private, coinage, while, his, aristocratic, and, technocratic, successor, li, linfu, d, 753, favored, government, monopoly, over, the, issuance, of, coinage, after, 737, most, of, xuanzong, s, confidence, rested, in, his, long, standing, chancellor, li, linfu, who, championed, a, more, aggressive, foreign, policy, employing, non, chinese, generals, this, policy, ultimately, created, the, conditions, for, a, massive, rebellion, against, xuanzong, the, tang, empire, was, at, its, height, of, power, up, until, the, middle, of, the, 8th, century, when, the, an, lushan, rebellion, december, 16, 755, february, 17, 763, destroyed, the, prosperity, of, the, empire, an, lushan, was, a, half, sogdian, half, turk, tang, commander, since, 744, who, had, experience, fighting, the, khitans, of, manchuria, with, a, victory, in, 744, yet, most, of, his, campaigns, against, the, khitans, were, unsuccessful, he, was, given, great, responsibility, in, hebei, which, allowed, him, to, rebel, with, an, army, of, more, than, 100, 000, troops, after, capturing, luoyang, he, named, himself, emperor, of, a, new, but, short, lived, yan, state, despite, early, victories, scored, by, tang, general, guo, ziyi, 697, 781, the, newly, recruited, troops, of, the, army, at, the, capital, were, no, match, for, an, lushan, s, frontier, veterans, so, the, court, fled, chang, an, while, the, heir, apparent, raised, troops, in, shanxi, and, xuanzong, fled, to, sichuan, province, they, called, upon, the, help, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, in, 756, the, uyghur, khan, moyanchur, was, greatly, excited, at, this, prospect, and, married, his, own, daughter, to, the, chinese, diplomatic, envoy, once, he, arrived, receiving, in, turn, a, chinese, princess, as, his, bride, the, uyghurs, helped, recapture, the, tang, capital, from, the, rebels, but, they, refused, to, leave, until, the, tang, paid, them, an, enormous, sum, of, tribute, in, silk, even, abbasid, arabs, assisted, the, tang, in, putting, down, an, lushan, s, rebellion, a, massacre, of, foreign, arab, and, persian, muslim, merchants, by, tian, shengong, happened, during, the, an, lushan, rebellion, in, the, yangzhou, massacre, 760, the, tibetans, took, hold, of, the, opportunity, and, raided, many, areas, under, chinese, control, and, even, after, the, tibetan, empire, had, fallen, apart, in, 842, and, the, uyghurs, soon, after, the, tang, were, in, no, position, to, reconquer, central, asia, after, 763, so, significant, was, this, loss, that, half, a, century, later, jinshi, examination, candidates, were, required, to, write, an, essay, on, the, causes, of, the, tang, s, decline, although, an, lushan, was, killed, by, one, of, his, eunuchs, in, 757, this, time, of, troubles, and, widespread, insurrection, continued, until, rebel, shi, siming, was, killed, by, his, own, son, in, 763, one, of, the, legacies, that, the, tang, government, left, since, 710, was, the, gradual, rise, of, regional, military, governors, the, jiedushi, who, slowly, came, to, challenge, the, power, of, the, central, government, after, the, an, lushan, rebellion, the, autonomous, power, and, authority, accumulated, by, the, jiedushi, in, hebei, went, beyond, the, central, government, s, control, after, a, series, of, rebellions, between, 781, and, 784, in, today, s, hebei, shandong, hubei, and, henan, provinces, the, government, had, to, officially, acknowledge, the, jiedushi, s, hereditary, rule, without, accreditation, the, tang, government, relied, on, these, governors, and, their, armies, for, protection, and, to, suppress, locals, that, would, take, up, arms, against, the, government, in, return, the, central, government, would, acknowledge, the, rights, of, these, governors, to, maintain, their, army, collect, taxes, and, even, to, pass, on, their, title, to, heirs, as, time, passed, these, military, governors, slowly, phased, out, the, prominence, of, civil, officials, drafted, by, exams, and, became, more, autonomous, from, central, authority, the, rule, of, these, powerful, military, governors, lasted, until, 960, when, a, new, civil, order, under, the, song, dynasty, was, established, also, the, abandonment, of, the, equal, field, system, meant, that, people, could, buy, and, sell, land, freely, many, poor, fell, into, debt, because, of, this, forced, to, sell, their, land, to, the, wealthy, which, led, to, the, exponential, growth, of, large, estates, with, the, breakdown, of, the, land, allocation, system, after, 755, the, central, chinese, state, barely, interfered, in, agricultural, management, and, acted, merely, as, tax, collector, for, roughly, a, millennium, save, a, few, instances, such, as, the, song, s, failed, land, nationalization, during, the, 13th, century, war, with, the, mongols, with, the, central, government, collapsing, in, authority, over, the, various, regions, of, the, empire, it, was, recorded, in, 845, that, bandits, and, river, pirates, in, parties, of, 100, or, more, began, plundering, settlements, along, the, yangtze, river, with, little, resistance, in, 858, massive, floods, along, the, grand, canal, inundated, vast, tracts, of, land, and, terrain, of, the, north, china, plain, which, drowned, tens, of, thousands, of, people, in, the, process, the, chinese, belief, in, the, mandate, of, heaven, granted, to, the, ailing, tang, was, also, challenged, when, natural, calamities, occurred, forcing, many, to, believe, that, the, tang, had, lost, their, right, to, rule, furthermore, in, 873, a, disastrous, harvest, shook, the, foundations, of, the, empire, in, some, areas, only, half, of, all, agricultural, produce, was, gathered, and, tens, of, thousands, faced, famine, and, starvation, in, the, earlier, period, of, the, tang, the, central, government, was, able, to, meet, crises, in, the, harvest, as, it, was, recorded, from, 714, to, 719, that, the, tang, government, responded, effectively, to, natural, disasters, by, extending, the, price, regulation, granary, system, throughout, the, country, the, central, government, was, able, then, to, build, a, large, surplus, stock, of, foods, to, ward, off, the, rising, danger, of, famine, and, increased, agricultural, productivity, through, land, reclamation, although, these, natural, calamities, and, rebellions, stained, the, reputation, and, hampered, the, effectiveness, of, the, central, government, the, early, 9th, century, is, nonetheless, viewed, as, a, period, of, recovery, for, the, tang, dynasty, the, government, s, withdrawal, from, its, role, in, managing, the, economy, had, the, unintended, effect, of, stimulating, trade, as, more, markets, with, fewer, bureaucratic, restrictions, were, opened, up, by, 780, the, old, grain, tax, and, labor, service, of, the, 7th, century, was, replaced, by, a, semiannual, tax, paid, in, cash, signifying, the, shift, to, a, money, economy, boosted, by, the, merchant, class, cities, in, the, jiangnan, region, to, the, south, such, as, yangzhou, suzhou, and, hangzhou, prospered, the, most, economically, during, the, late, tang, period, the, government, monopoly, on, the, production, of, salt, weakened, after, the, an, lushan, rebellion, was, placed, under, the, salt, commission, which, became, one, of, the, most, powerful, state, agencies, run, by, capable, ministers, chosen, as, specialists, the, commission, began, the, practice, of, selling, merchants, the, rights, to, buy, monopoly, salt, which, they, would, then, transport, and, sell, in, local, markets, in, 799, salt, accounted, for, over, half, of, the, government, s, revenues, s, a, m, adshead, writes, that, this, salt, tax, represents, the, first, time, that, an, indirect, tax, rather, than, tribute, levies, on, land, or, people, or, profit, from, state, enterprises, such, as, mines, had, been, the, primary, resource, of, a, major, state, even, after, the, power, of, the, central, government, was, in, decline, after, the, mid, 8th, century, it, was, still, able, to, function, and, give, out, imperial, orders, on, a, massive, scale, the, old, book, of, tang, compiled, in, 945, recorded, a, government, decree, issued, in, 828, that, standardized, irrigational, square, pallet, chain, pumps, throughout, the, country, in, the, second, year, of, the, taihe, reign, period, in, the, second, month, a, standard, model, of, the, chain, pump, was, issued, from, the, palace, and, the, people, of, jingzhao, fu, d, footnote, the, capital, were, ordered, by, the, emperor, to, make, a, considerable, number, of, machines, for, distribution, to, the, people, along, the, zheng, bai, canal, for, irrigation, purposes, the, last, great, ambitious, ruler, of, the, tang, dynasty, was, emperor, xianzong, r, 805, 820, whose, reign, was, aided, by, the, fiscal, reforms, of, the, 780s, including, a, government, monopoly, on, the, salt, industry, he, also, had, an, effective, and, well, trained, imperial, army, stationed, at, the, capital, led, by, his, court, eunuchs, this, was, the, army, of, divine, strategy, numbering, 240, 000, in, strength, as, recorded, in, 798, between, the, years, 806, and, 819, emperor, xianzong, conducted, seven, major, military, campaigns, to, quell, the, rebellious, provinces, that, had, claimed, autonomy, from, central, authority, managing, to, subdue, all, but, two, of, them, under, his, reign, there, was, a, brief, end, to, the, hereditary, jiedushi, as, xianzong, appointed, his, own, military, officers, and, staffed, the, regional, bureaucracies, once, again, with, civil, officials, however, xianzong, s, successors, proved, less, capable, and, more, interested, in, the, leisure, of, hunting, feasting, and, playing, outdoor, sports, allowing, eunuchs, to, amass, more, power, as, drafted, scholar, officials, caused, strife, in, the, bureaucracy, with, factional, parties, the, eunuchs, power, became, unchallenged, after, emperor, wenzong, s, r, 826, 840, failed, plot, to, have, them, overthrown, instead, the, allies, of, emperor, wenzong, were, publicly, executed, in, the, west, market, of, chang, an, by, the, eunuchs, command, however, the, tang, did, manage, to, restore, at, least, indirect,

large, palace, quarters, and, entertained, political, emissaries, with, music, sports, acrobatic, stunts, poetry, paintings, and, dramatic, theater, performances, the, capital, was, also, filled, with, incredible, amounts, of, riches, and, resources, to, spare, when, the, chinese, prefectural, government, officials, traveled, to, the, capital, in, the, year, 643, to, give, the, annual, report, of, the, affairs, in, their, districts, emperor, taizong, discovered, that, many, had, no, proper, quarters, to, rest, in, and, were, renting, rooms, with, merchants, therefore, emperor, taizong,

its, influence, during, the, tang, period, and, was, accepted, by, some, members, of, imperial, family, becoming, thoroughly, sinicized, and, a, permanent, part, of, chinese, traditional, culture, in, an, age, before, neo, confucianism, and, figures, such, as, zhu, xi, 1130, 1200, buddhism, had, begun, to, flourish, in, china, during, the, northern, and, southern, dynasties, and, became, the,

alloys, porcelain, products, and, new, dyes, the, historian, joseph, needham, labeled, the, work, of, the, taoist, alchemists, as, protoscience, rather, than, pseudoscience, however, the, close, connection, between, taoism, and, alchemy, which, some, sinologists, have, asserted, is, refuted, by, nathan, sivin, who, states, that, alchemy, was, just, as, prominent, if, not, more, so, in, the,
