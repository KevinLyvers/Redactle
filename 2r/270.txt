polo, appeared, about, the, year, 1299, some, doubted, the, accuracy, of, marco, polo, s, accounts, due, to, the, lack, of, mentioning, the, great, wall, of, china, chopsticks, tea, houses, which, would, have, been, a, prominent, sight, since, europeans, had, yet, to, adopt, a, tea, culture, as, well, the, practice, of, foot, binding, by, the, women, in, capital, of, the, great, khan, recent, studies, however, show, that, polo, s, account, is, largely, accurate, and, unique, the, yuan, undertook, extensive, public, works, among, kublai, khan, s, top, engineers, and, scientists, was, the, astronomer, guo, shoujing, who, was, tasked, with, many, public, works, projects, and, helped, the, yuan, reform, the, lunisolar, calendar, to, provide, an, accuracy, of, 365, 2425, days, of, the,

yuan, dynasty, was, the, first, dynasty, founded, by, non, han, ethnicity, that, ruled, all, of, china, proper, in, the, historiography, of, mongolia, it, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, continuation, of, the, mongol, empire, mongols, are, widely, known, to, worship, the, eternal, heaven, and, according, to, the, traditional, mongolian, ideology, yuan, is, considered, to, be, the, beginning, of, an, infinite, number, of, beings, the, foundation, of, peace, and, happiness, state, power, the, dream, of, many, peoples, besides, it, there, is, nothing, great, or, precious, in, traditional, historiography, of, china, on, the, other, hand, the, yuan, dynasty, is, usually, considered, to, be, the, legitimate, dynasty, between, the, song, dynasty, and, the, ming, dynasty, note, however, yuan, dynasty, is, traditionally, often, extended, to, cover, the, mongol, empire, before, kublai, khan, s, formal, establishment, of, the, yuan, in, 1271, partly, because, kublai, officially, honoured, prior, rulers, of, the, mongol, empire, as, yuan, emperors, by, conferring, them, posthumous, names, and, temple, names, despite, the, traditional, historiography, as, well, as, the, official, views, including, the, government, of, the, ming, dynasty, which, overthrew, the, yuan, dynasty, there, also, exist, chinese, people, who, did, not, consider, the, yuan, dynasty, as, a, legitimate, dynasty, of, china, but, rather, as, a, period, of, foreign, domination, the, latter, believe, that, han, chinese, were, treated, as, second, class, citizens, and, that, china, stagnated, economically, and, scientifically, the, dynasty, chose, white, as, its, imperial, color, which, corresponds, to, the, metal, element, according, to, the, theory, of, the, five, elements, wuxing, the, metal, element, does, not, follow, from, the, song, s, dynastic, element, five, in, the, creation, sequence, of, the, five, elements, instead, it, follows, from, the, jin, dynasty, s, dynastic, element, earth, although, the, yuan, did, not, openly, announce, it, its, choice, of, white, as, its, imperial, color, suggests, that, it, considered, jin, another, conquest, dynasty, rather, than, the, han, chinese, song, dynasty, as, its, rightful, predecessor, the, dragon, clothing, of, imperial, china, was, used, by, the, ilkhanids, the, chinese, huangdi, emperor, title, was, used, by, the, ilkhanids, due, to, heavy, clout, upon, the, mongols, of, the, chinese, system, of, politics, seals, with, chinese, characters, were, created, by, the, ilkhanids, themselves, besides, the, seals, they, received, from, the, yuan, dynasty, which, contain, references, to, a, chinese, government, organization, 46, the, structure, of, the, yuan, government, took, shape, during, the, reign, of, kublai, khan, 1260, 1294, while, some, changes, took, place, such, as, the, functions, of, certain, institutions, the, essential, components, of, the, government, bureaucracy, remained, intact, from, the, beginning, to, the, end, of, the, dynasty, in, 1368, the, system, of, bureaucracy, created, by, kublai, khan, reflected, various, cultures, in, the, empire, including, that, of, the, hans, khitans, jurchens, mongols, and, tibetan, buddhists, while, the, official, terminology, of, the, institutions, may, indicate, the, government, structure, was, almost, purely, that, of, native, chinese, dynasties, the, yuan, bureaucracy, actually, consisted, of, a, mix, of, elements, from, different, cultures, the, chinese, style, elements, of, the, bureaucracy, mainly, came, from, the, native, tang, song, as, well, as, khitan, liao, and, jurchen, jin, dynasties, chinese, advisers, such, as, liu, bingzhong, and, yao, shu, gave, strong, influence, to, kublai, s, early, court, and, the, central, government, administration, was, established, within, the, first, decade, of, kublai, s, reign, this, government, adopted, the, traditional, chinese, tripartite, division, of, authority, among, civil, military, and, censorial, offices, including, the, central, secretariat, zhongshu, sheng, to, manage, civil, affairs, the, privy, council, sh, m, yu, n, to, manage, military, affairs, and, the, censorate, to, conduct, internal, surveillance, and, inspection, the, actual, functions, of, both, central, and, local, government, institutions, however, showed, a, major, overlap, between, the, civil, and, military, jurisdictions, due, to, the, mongol, traditional, reliance, on, military, institutions, and, offices, as, the, core, of, governance, nevertheless, such, a, civilian, bureaucracy, with, the, central, secretariat, as, the, top, institution, that, was, directly, or, indirectly, responsible, for, most, other, governmental, agencies, such, as, the, traditional, chinese, style, six, ministries, was, created, in, china, at, various, times, another, central, government, institution, called, the, department, of, state, affairs, shangshu, sheng, that, mainly, dealt, with, finance, was, established, such, as, during, the, reign, of, k, l, g, khan, or, emperor, wuzong, but, was, usually, abandoned, shortly, afterwards, while, the, existence, of, these, central, government, departments, and, the, six, ministries, which, had, been, introduced, since, the, sui, and, tang, dynasties, gave, a, sinicized, image, in, the, yuan, administration, the, actual, functions, of, these, ministries, also, reflected, how, mongolian, priorities, and, policies, reshaped, and, redirected, those, institutions, for, example, the, authority, of, the, yuan, legal, system, the, ministry, of, justice, did, not, extend, to, legal, cases, involving, mongols, and, semu, who, had, separate, courts, of, justice, cases, involving, members, of, more, than, one, ethnic, group, were, decided, by, a, mixed, board, consisting, of, chinese, and, mongols, another, example, was, the, insignificance, of, the, ministry, of, war, compared, with, native, chinese, dynasties, as, the, real, military, authority, in, yuan, times, resided, in, the, privy, council, the, kingdom, of, qocho, kingdom, of, dali, chiefdom, of, bozhou, other, tusi, kingdoms, and, goryeo, were, ruled, by, rulers, subject, to, and, in, some, cases, related, to, the, yuan, imperial, house, advances, in, polynomial, algebra, were, made, by, mathematicians, during, the, yuan, era, the, mathematician, zhu, shijie, 1249, 1314, solved, simultaneous, equations, with, up, to, four, unknowns, using, a, rectangular, array, of, coefficients, equivalent, to, modern, matrices, zhu, used, a, method, of, elimination, to, reduce, the, simultaneous, equations, to, a, single, equation, with, only, one, unknown, his, method, is, described, in, the, jade, mirror, of, the, four, unknowns, written, in, 1303, the, opening, pages, contain, a, diagram, of, pascal, s, triangle, the, summation, of, a, finite, arithmetic, series, is, also, covered, in, the, book, guo, shoujing, applied, mathematics, to, the, construction, of, calendars, he, was, one, of, the, first, mathematicians, in, china, to, work, on, spherical, trigonometry, gou, derived, a, cubic, interpolation, formula, for, his, astronomical, calculations, his, calendar, the, shoushi, li, time, granting, calendar, was, disseminated, in, 1281, as, the, official, calendar, of, the, yuan, dynasty, the, calendar, may, have, been, influenced, solely, by, the, work, of, song, dynasty, astronomer, shen, kuo, or, possibly, by, the, work, of, arab, astronomers, there, are, no, explicit, signs, of, muslim, influences, in, the, shoushi, calendar, but, mongol, rulers, were, known, to, be, interested, in, muslim, calendars, mathematical, knowledge, from, the, middle, east, was, introduced, to, china, under, the, mongols, and, muslim, astronomers, brought, arabic, numerals, to, china, in, the, 13th, century, the, physicians, of, the, yuan, court, came, from, diverse, cultures, healers, were, divided, into, non, mongol, physicians, called, otachi, and, traditional, mongol, shamans, the, mongols, characterized, otachi, doctors, by, their, use, of, herbal, remedies, which, was, distinguished, from, the, spiritual, cures, of, mongol, shamanism, physicians, received, official, support, from, the, yuan, government, and, were, given, special, legal, privileges, kublai, created, the, imperial, academy, of, medicine, to, manage, medical, treatises, and, the, education, of, new, doctors, confucian, scholars, were, attracted, to, the, medical, profession, because, it, ensured, a, high, income, and, medical, ethics, were, compatible, with, confucian, virtues, the, chinese, medical, tradition, of, the, yuan, had, four, great, schools, that, the, yuan, inherited, from, the, jin, dynasty, all, four, schools, were, based, on, the, same, intellectual, foundation, but, advocated, different, theoretical, approaches, toward, medicine, under, the, mongols, the, practice, of, chinese, medicine, spread, to, other, parts, of, the, empire, chinese, physicians, were, brought, along, military, campaigns, by, the, mongols, as, they, expanded, towards, the, west, chinese, medical, techniques, such, as, acupuncture, moxibustion, pulse, diagnosis, and, various, herbal, drugs, and, elixirs, were, transmitted, westward, to, the, middle, east, and, the, rest, of, the, empire, several, medical, advances, were, made,

kublai, huihui, doctors, staffed, at, two, imperial, hospitals, were, responsible, for, treating, the, imperial, family, and, members, of, the, court, chinese, physicians, opposed, western, medicine, because, its, humoral, system, contradicted, the, yin, yang, and, wuxing, philosophy, underlying, traditional, chinese, medicine, no, chinese, translation, of, western, medical, works, is, known, but, it, is, possible, that, the, chinese, had, access, to, avicenna, s, the, canon, of, medicine, the, mongol, rulers, patronized, the, yuan, printing, industry, chinese, printing, technology, was, transferred, to, the, mongols, through, kingdom, of, qocho, and, tibetan, intermediaries, some, yuan, documents, such, as, wang, zhen, s, nong, shu, were, printed, with, earthenware, movable, type, a, technology, invented, in, the, 12th, century, however, most, published, works, were, still, produced, through, traditional, block, printing, techniques, the, publication, of, a, taoist, text,

quanzhou, dating, to, the, yuan, period, the, mongols, had, employed, foreigners, long, before, the, reign, of, kublai, khan, the, founder, of, the, yuan, dynasty, but, during, kublai, s, reign, a, hierarchy, of, reliability, was, introduced, in, china, the, population, was, divided, into, the, following, classes, the, ordering, of, the, classes, and, the, placement, of, people, in, them, came, down, to, how, loyal, and, trustworthy, to, the, mongols, they, were, this, was, defined, by, the, date, they, surrendered, to, the, mongols, and, had, little, to, do, with, their, ethnicity, ethnic, han, chinese, could, be, classified, as, either, han, ren, or, nan, ren, while, khitans, and, jurchens, from, qara, khitai, were, not, considered, han, but, semu, the, earlier, they, surrendered, to, the, mongols, the, higher, they, were, placed, while, the, more, they, held, out, the, lower, they, were, ranked, as, a, result, the, northern, chinese, were, ranked, higher, than, the, southern, chinese, because, the, song, dynasty, in, southern, china, fought, longer, and, surrendered, later, 264, 265, 426, similarly, the, uighur, and, karluk, monarchs, were, ranked, higher, than, the, korean, monarch, at, court, because, they, surrendered, earlier, while, the, koreans, surrendered, later, the, uighurs, in, particular, were, noted, to, not, have, fought, at, all, 247, the, mongols, employed, people, from, different, regions, to, oversee, different, parts, of, their, empire, central, asian, muslims, served, as, administrators, in, china, while, han, people, and, khitans, from, china, served, as, administrators, over, the, muslim, population, in, bukhara, in, central, asia, foreigners, were, used, to, curtail, the, power, of, the, local, peoples, of, both, lands, han, people, were, moved, to, central, asian, areas, like, besh, baliq, almaliq, and, samarqand, by, the, mongols, where, they, worked, as, artisans, and, farmers, alans, were, recruited, into, the, mongol, forces, with, one, unit, called, right, alan, guard, which, was, combined, with, recently, surrendered, soldiers, mongols, and, chinese, soldiers, stationed, in, the, area, of, the, former, kingdom, of, qocho, and, in, besh, balikh, the, mongols, established, a, chinese, military, colony, led, by, chinese, general, qi, gongzhi, 255, after, the, mongol, conquest, of, central, asia, by, genghis, khan, foreigners, were, chosen, as, administrators, of, gardens, and, fields, in, samarqand, while, co, management, with, chinese, and, khitans, was, required, since, muslims, were, not, allowed, to, manage, without, them, the, yuan, appointed, governor, of, samarqand, was, a, khitan, by, the, name, of, ahai, he, was, from, the, qara, khitai, held, the, title, taishi, and, was, familiar, with, chinese, culture, han, officials, and, colonists, were, sent, by, the, yuan, dynasty, to, areas, of, lingbei, province, including, henning, circuit, yilan, prefecture, and, qian, prefecture, politically, the, system, of, government, created, by, kublai, khan, was, the, product, of, a, compromise, between, mongolian, patrimonial, feudalism, and, the, traditional, chinese, autocratic, bureaucratic, system, nevertheless, socially, the, educated, chinese, elite, were, in, general, not, given, the, degree, of, esteem, that, they, had, been, accorded, previously, under, native, chinese, dynasties, although, the, traditional, chinese, elite, were, not, given, their, share, of, power, the, mongols, and, the, semu, people, various, allied, groups, from, central, asia, and, the, western, end, of, the, empire, largely, remained, strangers, to, the, mainstream, chinese, culture, and, this, dichotomy, gave, the, yuan, regime, a, somewhat, strong, colonial, coloration, the, unequal, treatment, is, possibly, due, to, the, fear, of, transferring, power, to, the, ethnic, chinese, under, their, rule, the, mongols, and, semu, were, given, certain, advantages, in, the, dynasty, and, this, would, last, even, after, the, restoration, of, the, imperial, examination, in, the, early, 14th, century, in, general, there, were, very, few, north, chinese, or, southerners, reaching, the, highest, post, in, the, government, compared, with, the, possibility, that, persians, did, so, in, the, ilkhanate, later, the, yongle, emperor, of, the, ming, dynasty, also, mentioned, the, discrimination, that, existed, during, the, yuan, dynasty, in, response, to, an, objection, against, the, use, of, barbarians, in, his, government, the, yongle, emperor, answered, discrimination, was, used, by, the, mongols, during, the, yuan, dynasty, who, employed, only, mongols, and, tartars, and, discarded, northern, and, southern, chinese, and, this, was, precisely, the, cause, that, brought, disaster, upon, them, however, ordinary, mongol, families, fell, into, extreme, poverty, in, both, mongolia, and, china, proper, and, elite, positions, were, increasingly, penetrated, by, ethnic, han, 467, despite, the, high, position, given, to, muslims, some, policies, of, the, yuan, emperors, severely, discriminated, against, them, restricting, halal, slaughter, and, other, islamic, practices, like, circumcision, as, well, as, kosher, butchering, for, jews, forcing, them, to, eat, food, the, mongol, way, toward, the, end, corruption, and, the, persecution, became, so, severe, that, muslim, generals, joined, han, in, rebelling, against, the, mongols, the, ming, founder, zhu, yuanzhang, had, muslim, generals, like, lan, yu, who, rebelled, against, the, mongols, and, defeated, them, in, combat, some, muslim, communities, had, a, chinese, surname, y, ng, which, means, amongst, other, definitions, both, barracks, and, thanks, many, hui, muslims, claim, that, because, they, played, an, important, role, in, overthrowing, the, mongols, this, surname, was, given, in, thanks, by, the, han, chinese, for, assisting, them, during, the, war, fighting, the, mongols, among, the, ming, emperor, zhu, yuanzhang, s, armies, was, the, hui, muslim, feng, sheng, the, muslims, in, the, semu, class, also, revolted, against, the, yuan, dynasty, in, the, ispah, rebellion, but, the, rebellion, was, crushed, and, the, muslims, were, massacred, by, the, yuan, loyalist, commander, chen, youding, the, muslim, merchants, in, quanzhou, who, engaged, in, maritime, trade, enriched, their, families, which, encompassed, their, political, and, trade, activities, as, families, historians, see, the, violent, chinese, backlash, that, happened, at, the, end, of, the, yuan, dynasty, against, the, wealth, of, the, muslim, and, semu, as, something, inevitable, however, anti, muslim, and, anti, semu, laws, had, already, been, passed, by, the, yuan, dynasty, in, 1340, all, marriages, were, forced, to, follow, confucian, principles, in, marriage, regulations, in, 1329, all, foreign, holy, men, including, muslims, had, tax, exemptions, revoked, in, 1328, the, position, of, muslim, qadi, was, abolished, after, its, powers, were, limited, in, 1311, this, resulted, in, anti, mongol, sentiment, among, muslims, so, some, anti, yuan, rebels, in, the, mid, 14th, century, were, joined, by, muslims, in, 1357, 1367, the, yisibaxi, muslim, persian, garrison, started, a, revolt, against, the, yuan, dynasty, in, quanzhou, and, southern, fujian, persian, merchants, amin, ud, din, amiliding, and, saif, ud, din, saifuding, led, the, revolt, persian, official, yawuna, assassinated, both, amin, ud, din, and, saif, ud, din, in, 1362, and, took, control, of, the, muslim, rebel, forces, for, five, years, the, muslim, rebels, tried, to, strike, north, and, took, over, some, parts, of, xinghua, but, were, defeated, at, fuzhou, two, times, and, failed, to, take, it, yuan, provincial, loyalist, forces, from, fuzhou, defeated, the, muslim, rebels, in, 1367, after, a, muslim, rebel, officer, named, jin, ji, defected, from, yawuna, 121, the, historian, frederick, w, mote, wrote, that, the, usage, of, the, term, social, classes, for, this, system, was, misleading, and, that, the, position, of, people, within, the, four, class, system, was, not, an, indication, of, their, actual, social, power, and, wealth, but, just, entailed, degrees, of, privilege, to, which, they, were, entitled, institutionally, and, legally, so, a, person, s, standing, within, the, classes, was, not, a, guarantee, of, their, standing, since, there, were, rich, and, well, socially, standing, chinese, while, there, were, less, rich, mongol, and, semu, than, there, were, mongol, and, semu, who, lived, in, poverty, and, were, ill, treated, japanese, historians, like, uematsu, sugiyama, and, morita, criticized, the, perception, that, a, four, class, system, existed, under, mongol, rule, and, funada, yoshiyuki, questioned, the, very, existence, of, the, semu, as, a, class, the, territory, of, the, yuan, dynasty, was, divided, into, the, central, region, governed, by, the, central, secretariat, and, places, under, control, of, various, provinces, or, branch, secretariats, as, well, as, the, region, under, the, bureau, of, buddhist, and, tibetan, affairs, the, central, region, consisting, of, present, day, hebei, shandong, shanxi, the, south, eastern, part, of, present, day, inner, mongolia, and, the, henan, areas, to, the, north, of, the, yellow, river, was, considered, the, most, important, region, of, the, dynasty, and, directly, governed, by, the, central, secretariat, or, zhongshu, sheng, at, khanbaliq, modern, beijing, similarly, another, top, level, administrative, department, called, the, bureau, of, buddhist, and, tibetan, affairs, chinese, pinyin, xu, nzh, ngyu, n, held, administrative, rule, over, the, whole, of, modern, day, tibet, and, a, part, of, sichuan, qinghai, and, kashmir, branch, secretariats, or, simply, provinces, were, provincial, level, administrative, organizations, or, institutions, though, they, were, not, exactly, provinces, in, modern, sense, there, were, eleven, regular, provinces, in, yuan, dynasty, and, their, administrations, were, subordinated, to, the, central, secretariat, below, the, level, of, provinces, the, largest, political, division, was, the, circuit, followed, by, l, f, and, zh, u, these, are, three, kinds, of, prefecture, like, divisions, the, lowest, political, division, was, the, county, basically, l, were, higher, than, f, which, were, higher, than, zh, u, however, the, actual, relationship, between, them, could, be, very, complicated, all, of, l, f, and, zh, u, could, administer, counties, some, f, and, zh, u, were, directly, administered, by, the, province, while, some, existed, inside, a, l, a, l, usually, administered, several, counties, along, with, several, f, and, zh, u, and, the, f, or, zh, u, themselves, could, also, administer, their, own, counties, as, a, result, it, is, impossible, to, delineate, exactly, how, many, tiers, of, divisions, there, were, under, a, province, this, government, structure, at, the, provincial, level, was, later, inherited, and, modified, by, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, 39, 54, 54, n, 116, 23, 24, e, 39, 915, n, 116,
