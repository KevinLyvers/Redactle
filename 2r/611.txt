an, ancient, mesoamerican, city, located, in, a, sub, valley, of, the, valley, of, mexico, which, is, located, in, the, state, of, mexico, 40, kilometers, 25, mi, northeast, of, modern, day, mexico, city, teotihuacan, is, known, today, as, the, site, of, many, of, the, most, architecturally, significant, mesoamerican, pyramids, built, in, the, pre, columbian, americas, namely, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, and, the, pyramid, of, the, moon, although, close, to, mexico, city, teotihuacan, was, not, a, mexica, i, e, aztec, city, and, it, predates, the, mexica, empire, by, many, centuries, at, its, zenith, perhaps, in, the, first, half, of, the, first, millennium, 1, ce, to, 500, ce, teotihuacan, was, the, largest, city, in, the, americas, with, a, population, estimated, at, 125, 000, or, more, making, it, at, least, the, sixth, largest, city, in, the, world, during, its, epoch, the, city, covered, eight, square, miles, 21, km, 2, and, 80, to, 90, percent, of, the, total, population, of, the, valley, resided, in, teotihuacan, apart, from, the, pyramids, teotihuacan, is, also, anthropologically, significant, for, its, complex, multi, family, residential, compounds, the, avenue, of, the, dead, and, its, vibrant, well, preserved, murals, additionally, teotihuacan, exported, fine, obsidian, tools, found, throughout, mesoamerica, the, city, is, thought, to, have, been, established, around, 100, bce, with, major, monuments, continuously, under, construction, until, about, 250, ce, the, city, may, have, lasted, until, sometime, between, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, ce, but, its, major, monuments, were, sacked, and, systematically, burned, around, 550, ce, its, collapse, might, be, related, to, the, extreme, weather, events, of, 535, 536, teotihuacan, began, as, a, religious, center, in, the, mexican, highlands, around, the, first, century, ce, it, became, the, largest, and, most, populated, center, in, the, pre, columbian, americas, teotihuacan, was, home, to, multi, floor, apartment, compounds, built, to, accommodate, the, large, population, the, term, teotihuacan, or, teotihuacano, is, also, used, to, refer, to, the, whole, civilization, and, cultural, complex, associated, with, the, site, although, it, is, a, subject, of, debate, whether, teotihuacan, was, the, center, of, a, state, empire, its, influence, throughout, mesoamerica, is, well, documented, evidence, of, teotihuacano, presence, is, found, at, numerous, sites, in, veracruz, and, the, maya, region, the, later, aztecs, saw, these, magnificent, ruins, and, claimed, a, common, ancestry, with, the, teotihuacanos, modifying, and, adopting, aspects, of, their, culture, the, ethnicity, of, the, inhabitants, of, teotihuacan, is, the, subject, of, debate, possible, candidates, are, the, nahua, otomi, or, totonac, ethnic, groups, other, scholars, have, suggested, that, teotihuacan, was, multi, ethnic, due, to, the, discovery, of, cultural, aspects, connected, to, the, maya, as, well, as, oto, pamean, people, it, is, clear, that, many, different, cultural, groups, lived, in, teotihuacan, during, the, height, of, its, power, with, migrants, coming, from, all, over, but, especially, from, oaxaca, and, the, gulf, coast, after, the, collapse, of, teotihuacan, central, mexico, was, dominated, by, more, regional, powers, notably, xochicalco, and, tula, the, city, and, the, archeological, site, are, located, in, what, is, now, the, san, juan, teotihuac, n, municipality, in, the, state, of, m, xico, approximately, 40, kilometers, 25, mi, northeast, of, mexico, city, the, site, covers, a, total, surface, area, of, 83, square, kilometers, 32, sq, mi, and, was, designated, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 1987, it, is, the, most, visited, archeological, site, in, mexico, receiving, 4, 185, 017, visitors, in, 2017, the, name, te, t, huac, n, was, given, by, the, nahuatl, speaking, aztecs, centuries, after, the, fall, of, the, city, around, 550, ce, the, term, has, been, glossed, as, birthplace, of, the, gods, or, place, where, gods, were, born, reflecting, nahua, creation, myths, that, were, said, to, occur, in, teotihuacan, nahuatl, scholar, thelma, d, sullivan, interprets, the, name, as, place, of, those, who, have, the, road, of, the, gods, this, is, because, the, aztecs, believed, that, the, gods, created, the, universe, at, that, site, the, name, is, pronounced, in, nahuatl, with, the, stress, on, the, syllable, wa, by, normal, nahuatl, orthographic, conventions, a, written, accent, mark, would, not, appear, in, that, position, both, this, pronunciation, and, the, spanish, pronunciation, are, used, in, spanish, and, usually, english, the, stress, falls, on, the, final, syllable, the, original, name, of, the, city, is, unknown, but, it, appears, in, hieroglyphic, texts, from, the, maya, region, as, puh, or, place, of, reeds, this, suggests, that, in, the, maya, civilization, of, the, classic, period, teotihuacan, was, understood, as, a, place, of, reeds, similar, to, other, postclassic, central, mexican, settlements, that, took, the, name, of, tollan, such, as, tula, hidalgo, and, cholula, this, naming, convention, led, to, much, confusion, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, scholars, debated, whether, teotihuacan, or, tula, hidalgo, was, the, tollan, described, by, 16th, century, chronicles, it, now, seems, clear, that, tollan, may, be, understood, as, a, generic, nahua, term, applied, to, any, large, settlement, in, the, mesoamerican, concept, of, urbanism, tollan, and, other, language, equivalents, serve, as, a, metaphor, linking, the, bundles, of, reeds, and, rushes, that, formed, part, of, the, lacustrine, environment, of, the, valley, of, mexico, and, the, large, gathering, of, people, in, a, city, as, of, january, 23, 2018, the, name, teotihuacan, has, come, under, scrutiny, by, experts, who, now, feel, that, the, site, s, name, may, have, been, changed, by, spanish, colonizers, in, the, 16th, century, archeologist, ver, nica, ortega, of, the, national, institute, of, anthropology, and, history, states, that, the, city, appears, to, have, actually, been, named, teohuacan, meaning, city, of, the, sun, rather, than, city, of, the, gods, as, the, current, name, suggests, the, first, human, establishment, in, the, teotihuacan, area, dates, back, to, 600, bce, and, until, 200, bce, the, site, consisted, of, scattered, small, villages, the, total, estimated, population, of, the, teotihuacan, valley, during, this, time, was, approximately, 6, 000, from, 100, bce, to, 750, ce, teotihuacan, evolved, into, a, huge, urban, and, administrative, center, with, cultural, influences, throughout, the, broader, mesoamerica, region, the, history, of, teotihuacan, is, distinguished, by, four, consecutive, periods, period, i, occurred, between, 200, 1, bce, and, marks, the, development, of, a, distinctively, urban, area, during, this, period, teotihuacan, began, to, grow, into, a, city, as, local, farmers, began, coalescing, around, the, abundant, springs, of, teotihuacan, period, ii, lasted, between, 1, ce, to, 350, ce, during, this, era, teotihuacan, exhibited, explosive, growth, and, emerged, as, the, largest, metropolis, in, mesoamerica, factors, influencing, this, growth, include, the, destruction, of, other, settlements, due, to, volcanic, eruptions, and, the, economic, pull, of, the, expanding, city, this, influx, of, new, residents, caused, a, reorganization, of, urban, housing, to, the, unique, compound, complexes, that, typify, teotihuacan, this, period, is, notable, for, its, monumental, architecture, and, sculpture, especially, the, construction, of, some, of, the, most, well, known, sites, of, teotihuacan, the, pyramids, of, the, sun, and, moon, further, the, shift, of, political, power, from, the, temple, of, the, feathered, serpent, and, its, surrounding, palace, structure, to, the, avenue, of, the, dead, complex, occurred, sometime, between, ce, 250, and, 350, some, authors, believe, that, this, represents, a, shift, from, the, centralized, monarchical, political, system, to, a, more, decentralized, and, bureaucratic, organization, around, 300, ce, the, temple, of, the, feathered, serpent, was, desecrated, and, construction, in, the, city, proceeded, in, a, more, egalitarian, direction, focusing, on, the, building, of, comfortable, stone, accommodations, for, the, population, period, iii, lasted, from, 350, to, 650, ce, and, is, known, as, the, classical, period, of, teotihuacan, during, which, the, city, reached, the, apogee, of, its, influence, in, mesoamerica, its, population, is, estimated, at, a, minimum, of, 125, 000, inhabitants, and, the, city, was, among, the, largest, cities, in, the, ancient, world, containing, 2, 000, buildings, within, an, area, of, 18, square, kilometers, it, was, also, during, this, high, period, when, teotihuacan, contained, approximately, half, all, people, in, the, valley, of, mexico, becoming, a, kind, of, primate, city, of, mesoamerica, this, period, saw, a, massive, reconstruction, of, buildings, and, the, temple, of, the, feathered, serpent, which, dates, back, to, the, previous, period, was, covered, with, a, plaza, with, rich, sculptural, decoration, typical, artistic, artifacts, of, this, period, are, funeral, masks, crafted, mainly, from, green, stone, and, covered, with, mosaics, of, turquoise, shell, or, obsidian, these, masks, were, highly, uniform, in, nature, period, iv, describes, the, time, period, between, 650, and, 750, ce, it, marks, the, end, of, teotihuacan, as, a, major, power, in, mesoamerica, the, city, s, elite, housing, compounds, clustered, around, the, avenue, of, the, dead, bear, many, burn, marks, and, archeologists, hypothesize, that, the, city, experienced, civil, strife, that, hastened, its, decline, factors, that, also, led, to, the, decline, of, the, city, included, disruptions, in, tributary, relations, increased, social, stratification, and, power, struggles, between, the, ruling, and, intermediary, elites, following, this, decline, teotihuacan, continued, to, be, inhabited, though, it, never, reached, its, previous, levels, of, population, the, early, history, of, teotihuacan, is, quite, mysterious, and, the, origin, of, its, founders, is, uncertain, around, 300, bce, people, of, the, central, and, southeastern, areas, of, mesoamerica, began, to, gather, into, larger, settlements, teotihuacan, was, the, largest, urban, center, of, mesoamerica, before, the, aztecs, almost, 1000, years, prior, to, their, epoch, the, city, was, already, in, ruins, by, the, time, of, the, aztecs, for, many, years, archeologists, believed, it, was, built, by, the, toltec, this, belief, was, based, on, colonial, period, texts, such, as, the, florentine, codex, which, attributed, the, site, to, the, toltecs, however, the, nahuatl, word, toltec, generally, means, craftsman, of, the, highest, level, and, may, not, always, refer, to, the, toltec, civilization, centered, at, tula, hidalgo, since, toltec, civilization, flourished, centuries, after, teotihuacan, the, people, could, not, have, been, the, city, s, founders, in, the, late, formative, era, a, number, of, urban, centers, arose, in, central, mexico, the, most, prominent, of, these, appears, to, have, been, cuicuilco, on, the, southern, shore, of, lake, texcoco, scholars, have, speculated, that, the, eruption, of, the, xitle, volcano, may, have, prompted, a, mass, emigration, out, of, the, central, valley, and, into, the, teotihuacan, valley, these, settlers, may, have, founded, or, accelerated, the, growth, of, teotihuacan, other, scholars, have, put, forth, the, totonac, people, as, the, founders, of, teotihuacan, and, have, suggested, that, teotihuacan, was, a, multi, ethnic, state, since, they, find, diverse, cultural, aspects, connected, to, the, zapotec, mixtec, and, maya, peoples, the, builders, of, teotihuacan, took, advantage, of, the, geography, in, the, basin, of, mexico, from, the, swampy, ground, they, constructed, raised, beds, called, chinampas, creating, high, agricultural, productivity, despite, old, methods, of, cultivation, this, allowed, for, the, formation, of, channels, and, subsequently, canoe, traffic, to, transport, food, from, farms, around, the, city, the, earliest, buildings, at, teotihuacan, date, to, about, 200, bce, the, largest, pyramid, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, was, completed, by, 100, ce, evidence, of, a, king, or, other, authoritarian, ruler, is, strikingly, absent, in, teotihuacan, contemporaneous, cities, in, the, same, region, including, mayan, and, zapotec, as, well, as, the, earlier, olmec, civilization, left, ample, attestations, of, dynastic, authoritarian, sovereignty, in, the, form, of, royal, palaces, ceremonial, ball, courts, and, depictions, of, war, conquest, and, humiliated, captives, however, no, such, artifacts, have, been, found, in, teotihuacan, many, scholars, have, thus, concluded, that, teotihuacan, was, led, by, some, sort, of, collective, governance, in, january, 378, the, warlord, sihyaj, k, ahk, literally, born, of, fire, depicted, with, artifacts, and, the, feather, serpent, imagery, associated, with, teotihuacan, culture, conquered, tikal, 600, miles, away, from, teotihuacan, removing, and, replacing, the, maya, king, with, support, from, el, peru, and, naachtun, as, recorded, by, stela, 31, at, tikal, and, other, monuments, in, the, maya, region, at, this, time, the, spearthrower, owl, ruler, was, also, associated, with, teotihuacan, culture, linda, r, manzanilla, wrote, in, 2015, in, 378, a, group, of, teotihuacanos, organized, a, coup, d, etat, in, tikal, guatemala, this, was, not, the, teotihuacan, state, it, was, a, group, of, the, feathered, serpent, people, thrown, out, of, the, city, the, feathered, serpent, pyramid, was, burnt, all, the, sculptures, were, torn, from, the, temple, and, another, platform, was, built, to, efface, the, facade, in, 426, the, cop, n, ruling, dynasty, was, created, with, k, inich, yax, k, uk, mo, as, the, first, king, the, dynasty, went, on, to, have, sixteen, rulers, cop, n, is, located, in, modern, day, honduras, as, described, by, cop, n, altar, q, soon, thereafter, yax, k, uk, mo, installed, tok, casper, as, king, of, quirigu, about, 50, km, north, of, cop, n, the, city, reached, its, peak, in, 450, ce, when, it, was, the, center, of, a, powerful, culture, whose, influence, extended, through, much, of, the, mesoamerican, region, at, this, time, the, city, covered, over, 30, km, 2, over, 11, 1, 2, square, miles, and, perhaps, housed, a, population, of, 150, 000, people, with, one, estimate, reaching, as, high, as, 250, 000, various, districts, in, the, city, housed, people, from, across, the, teotihuacan, region, of, influence, which, spread, south, as, far, as, guatemala, notably, absent, from, the, city, are, fortifications, and, military, structures, the, nature, of, political, and, cultural, interactions, between, teotihuacan, and, the, centers, of, the, maya, region, as, well, as, elsewhere, in, mesoamerica, has, been, a, long, standing, and, significant, area, for, debate, substantial, exchange, and, interaction, occurred, over, the, centuries, from, the, terminal, preclassic, to, the, mid, classic, period, teotihuacan, inspired, ideologies, and, motifs, persisted, at, maya, centers, into, the, late, classic, long, after, teotihuacan, itself, had, declined, however, scholars, debate, the, extent, and, degree, of, teotihuacan, influence, some, believe, that, it, had, direct, and, militaristic, dominance, while, others, view, the, adoption, of, foreign, traits, as, part, of, a, selective, conscious, and, bi, directional, cultural, diffusion, new, discoveries, have, suggested, that, teotihuacan, was, not, much, different, in, its, interactions, with, other, centers, from, the, later, empires, such, as, the, toltec, and, aztec, it, is, believed, that, teotihuacan, had, a, major, influence, on, the, preclassic, and, classic, maya, architectural, styles, prominent, at, teotihuacan, are, found, widely, dispersed, at, a, number, of, distant, mesoamerican, sites, which, some, researchers, have, interpreted, as, evidence, for, teotihuacan, s, far, reaching, interactions, and, political, or, militaristic, dominance, a, style, particularly, associated, with, teotihuacan, is, known, as, talud, tablero, in, which, an, inwards, sloping, external, side, of, a, structure, talud, is, surmounted, by, a, rectangular, panel, tablero, variants, of, the, generic, style, are, found, in, a, number, of, maya, region, sites, including, tikal, kaminaljuyu, copan, becan, and, oxkintok, and, particularly, in, the, pet, n, basin, and, the, central, guatemalan, highlands, the, talud, tablero, style, pre, dates, its, earliest, appearance, at, teotihuacan, in, the, early, classic, period, it, appears, to, have, originated, in, the, tlaxcala, puebla, region, during, the, preclassic, analyses, have, traced, the, development, into, local, variants, of, the, talud, tablero, style, at, sites, such, as, tikal, where, its, use, precedes, the, 5th, century, appearance, of, iconographic, motifs, shared, with, teotihuacan, the, talud, tablero, style, disseminated, through, mesoamerica, generally, from, the, end, of, the, preclassic, period, and, not, specifically, or, solely, via, teotihuacano, influence, it, is, unclear, how, or, from, where, the, style, spread, into, the, maya, region, during, its, zenith, the, main, structures, at, teotihuacan, including, the, pyramids, were, painted, in, impressive, shades, of, dark, red, with, some, small, spots, persisting, to, this, day, the, city, was, a, center, of, industry, home, to, many, potters, jewelers, and, craftspeople, teotihuacan, is, known, for, producing, a, great, number, of, obsidian, artifacts, no, ancient, teotihuacano, non, ideographic, texts, are, known, to, exist, or, known, to, have, once, existed, inscriptions, from, maya, cities, show, that, teotihuacan, nobility, traveled, to, and, perhaps, conquered, local, rulers, as, far, away, as, honduras, maya, inscriptions, note, an, individual, named, by, scholars, as, spearthrower, owl, apparently, ruler, of, teotihuacan, who, reigned, for, over, 60, years, and, installed, his, relatives, as, rulers, of, tikal, and, uaxactun, in, guatemala, scholars, have, based, interpretations, of, teotihuacan, culture, on, its, archeology, murals, that, adorn, the, site, and, others, like, the, wagner, murals, found, in, private, collections, and, hieroglyphic, inscriptions, made, by, the, maya, describing, their, encounters, with, teotihuacan, conquerors, the, creation, of, murals, perhaps, tens, of, thousands, of, murals, reached, its, height, between, 450, and, 650, the, artistry, of, the, painters, was, unrivaled, in, mesoamerica, and, has, been, compared, with, that, of, painters, in, renaissance, florence, italy, scholars, originally, thought, that, invaders, attacked, the, city, in, the, 7th, or, 8th, century, sacking, and, burning, it, more, recent, evidence, however, seems, to, indicate, that, the, burning, was, limited, to, the, structures, and, dwellings, associated, primarily, with, the, ruling, class, some, think, this, suggests, that, the, burning, was, from, an, internal, uprising, and, the, invasion, theory, is, flawed, because, early, archeological, efforts, were, focused, exclusively, on, the, palaces, and, temples, places, used, by, the, upper, classes, because, all, of, these, sites, showed, burning, archeologists, concluded, that, the, whole, city, was, burned, instead, it, is, now, known, that, the, destruction, was, centered, on, major, civic, structures, along, the, avenue, of, the, dead, the, sculptures, inside, palatial, structures, such, as, xalla, were, shattered, no, traces, of, foreign, invasion, are, visible, at, the, site, evidence, for, population, decline, beginning, around, the, 6th, century, lends, some, support, to, the, internal, unrest, hypothesis, the, decline, of, teotihuacan, has, been, correlated, to, lengthy, droughts, related, to, the, climate, changes, of, 535, 536, possibly, caused, by, the, eruption, of, the, ilopango, volcano, in, el, salvador, this, theory, of, ecological, decline, is, supported, by, archeological, remains, that, show, a, rise, in, the, percentage, of, juvenile, skeletons, with, evidence, of, malnutrition, during, the, 6th, century, further, supporting, the, hypothesis, of, famine, as, one, of, the, more, plausible, reasons, for, the, decline, of, teotihuacan, urbanized, teotihuacanos, would, likely, have, been, dependent, on, agricultural, crops, such, as, maize, beans, amaranth, tomatillos, and, pumpkins, if, climate, change, affected, crop, yields, then, the, harvest, would, not, have, been, sufficient, to, feed, teotihucan, s, extensive, population, however, the, two, main, hypotheses, are, not, mutually, exclusive, drought, leading, to, famine, could, have, led, to, incursions, from, smaller, surrounding, civilizations, as, well, as, internal, unrest, as, teotihuacan, fell, in, local, prominence, other, nearby, centers, such, as, cholula, xochicalco, and, cacaxtla, competed, to, fill, the, power, void, they, may, have, even, aligned, themselves, against, teotihuacan, to, seize, the, opportunity, to, further, reduce, its, influence, and, power, the, art, and, architecture, at, these, sites, emulate, teotihuacan, forms, but, also, demonstrate, an, eclectic, mix, of, motifs, and, iconography, from, other, parts, of, mesoamerica, particularly, the, maya, region, the, sudden, destruction, of, teotihuacan, was, common, for, mesoamerican, city, states, of, the, classic, and, epi, classic, period, many, maya, states, suffered, similar, fates, in, subsequent, centuries, a, series, of, events, often, referred, to, as, the, classic, maya, collapse, nearby, in, the, morelos, valley, xochicalco, was, sacked, and, burned, in, 900, and, tula, met, a, similar, fate, around, 1150, during, the, 1200s, ce, nahua, migrants, repopulated, the, area, by, the, 1300s, it, had, fallen, under, the, sway, of, huexotla, and, in, 1409, was, assigned, its, own, tlatoani, huetzin, a, son, of, the, tlatoani, of, huexotla, but, his, reign, was, cut, short, when, tezozomoc, tlatoani, of, azcapotzalco, invaded, huexotla, and, the, neighboring, acolhua, lands, in, 1418, huetzin, was, deposed, by, the, invaders, and, tezozomoc, installed, a, man, named, totomochtzin, less, than, a, decade, later, in, 1427, the, aztec, empire, formed, and, teotihuacan, was, vassalized, once, more, by, the, acolhua, archeological, evidence, suggests, that, teotihuacan, was, a, multi, ethnic, city, and, while, the, predominant, language, or, languages, used, in, teotihuacan, have, been, lost, to, history, totonac, and, nahua, early, forms, of, which, were, spoken, by, the, aztecs, seem, to, be, highly, plausible, this, apparent, regionally, diverse, population, of, teotihuacan, can, be, traced, back, to, a, natural, disaster, that, occurred, prior, to, its, population, boom, at, one, point, in, time, teotihuacan, was, rivaled, by, another, basin, power, cuicuilco, both, cities, roughly, the, same, size, and, hubs, for, trade, were, productive, centers, of, artisans, and, commerce, roughly, around, 100, bce, however, the, power, dynamic, changed, when, mount, xitle, an, active, volcano, erupted, and, heavily, affected, cuicuilco, and, the, farmland, that, supported, it, it, is, believed, that, the, later, exponential, growth, of, teotihuacan, s, population, was, due, to, the, subsequent, migration, of, those, displaced, by, the, eruption, while, this, eruption, is, referenced, as, being, the, primary, cause, of, the, mass, exodus, recent, advancements, of, dating, have, shed, light, on, an, even, earlier, eruption, the, eruption, of, popocatepetl, in, the, middle, of, the, first, century, preceded, that, of, xitle, and, is, believed, to, have, begun, the, aforementioned, degradation, of, agricultural, lands, and, structural, damage, to, the, city, xitle, s, eruption, further, instigated, the, abandonment, of, cuicuilco, in, the, tzacualli, phase, c, 1, 150, ce, teotihuacan, saw, a, population, growth, to, approximately, 60, 000, to, 80, 000, people, most, of, whom, are, believed, to, have, come, from, the, mexican, basin, following, this, growth, however, the, influx, of, new, residents, slowed, and, evidence, suggests, that, by, the, miccaotli, phase, c, 200, ce, the, urban, population, had, reached, its, maximum, in, 2001, terrence, kaufman, presented, linguistic, evidence, suggesting, that, an, important, ethnic, group, in, teotihuacan, was, of, totonacan, or, mixe, zoquean, linguistic, affiliation, he, uses, this, to, explain, general, influences, from, totonacan, and, mixe, zoquean, languages, in, many, other, mesoamerican, languages, whose, people, did, not, have, any, known, history, of, contact, with, either, of, the, abovementioned, groups, other, scholars, maintain, that, the, largest, population, group, must, have, been, of, otomi, ethnicity, because, the, otomi, language, is, known, to, have, been, spoken, in, the, area, around, teotihuacan, both, before, and, after, the, classic, period, and, not, during, the, middle, period, teotihuacan, compounds, show, evidence, of, being, segregated, into, three, classes, high, elites, intermediate, elites, and, the, laboring, class, residential, architectural, structures, seem, to, be, differentiable, by, the, artistry, and, complexity, of, the, structure, itself, based, on, the, quality, of, construction, materials, and, sizes, of, rooms, as, well, as, the, quality, of, assorted, objects, found, in, the, residency, dwellings, radiating, outward, from, the, central, district, and, along, the, avenue, of, the, dead, might, have, been, occupied, by, higher, status, individuals, however, teotihuacan, overall, does, not, appear, to, have, been, organized, into, discrete, zoning, districts, the, more, elite, compounds, were, often, decorated, with, elaborate, murals, thematic, elements, of, these, murals, included, processions, of, lavishly, dressed, priests, jaguar, figures, the, storm, god, deity, and, an, anonymous, goddess, whose, hands, offer, gifts, of, maize, precious, stones, and, water, rulers, who, may, have, requested, to, be, immortalized, through, art, are, noticeably, absent, in, teotihuacan, artwork, observed, artwork, instead, tends, to, portray, institutionalized, offices, and, deities, it, suggests, their, art, glorifies, nature, and, the, supernatural, and, emphasizes, egalitarian, rather, than, aristocratic, values, also, absent, from, teotihuacan, artwork, is, writing, despite, the, city, having, a, strong, network, of, contact, with, the, literate, maya, the, laboring, classes, themselves, also, stratified, consisted, of, farmers, skilled, craftworkers, and, the, peripheral, rural, population, the, city, dwelling, craftspeople, of, various, specialties, were, housed, in, apartment, complexes, distributed, throughout, the, city, known, as, neighborhood, centers, and, evidence, shows, that, these, centers, were, the, economic, and, cultural, engines, of, teotihuacan, established, by, the, elite, to, showcase, the, sumptuary, goods, that, the, resident, craftsmen, provided, the, neighborhood, centers, representing, diversity, in, goods, was, aided, by, the, heavy, concentration, of, immigrated, individuals, from, different, regions, of, mesoamerica, along, with, archeological, evidence, pointing, to, one, of, the, primary, traded, items, being, textiles, craftspeople, capitalized, on, their, mastery, of, painting, building, the, performance, of, music, and, military, training, these, neighborhood, centers, closely, resembled, individual, compounds, often, surrounded, by, physical, barriers, separating, them, from, the, others, in, this, way, teotihuacan, developed, an, internal, economic, competition, that, fueled, productivity, and, helped, create, a, social, structure, of, its, own, that, differed, from, the, larger, structure, the, repeated, actions, of, the, craftworkers, left, their, physical, mark, based, on, the, wear, of, teeth, archeologists, were, able, to, determine, that, some, bodies, worked, with, fibers, with, their, frontal, teeth, insinuating, that, they, were, involved, with, making, nets, like, those, depicted, in, mural, art, female, skeletons, provided, evidence, that, they, might, have, sewn, or, painted, for, long, periods, of, time, indicative, of, the, headdresses, that, were, created, as, well, as, pottery, which, was, fired, and, painted, wear, on, specific, joints, indicate, the, carrying, of, heavy, objects, over, an, extended, period, of, time, evidence, of, these, heavy, materials, is, found, in, the, copious, amounts, of, imported, pottery, and, raw, materials, found, on, site, such, as, rhyolitic, glass, shards, marble, and, slate, the, residences, of, the, rural, population, of, the, city, were, in, enclaves, between, the, middle, class, residences, or, the, periphery, of, the, city, while, smaller, encampments, filled, with, earthenware, from, other, regions, also, suggest, that, merchants, were, situated, in, their, own, encampments, as, well, in, an, illustrated, dictionary, of, the, gods, and, symbols, of, ancient, mexico, and, the, maya, miller, and, taube, list, eight, deities, esther, pasztory, adds, one, more, the, consensus, among, scholars, is, that, the, primary, deity, of, teotihuacan, was, the, great, goddess, of, teotihuacan, the, dominant, civic, architecture, is, the, pyramid, politics, were, based, on, the, state, religion, and, religious, leaders, were, the, political, leaders, religious, leaders, would, commission, artists, to, create, religious, artworks, for, ceremonies, and, rituals, the, artwork, likely, commissioned, would, have, been, a, mural, or, a, censer, depicting, gods, like, the, great, goddess, of, teotihuacan, or, the, feathered, serpent, censers, would, be, lit, during, religious, rituals, to, invoke, the, gods, including, rituals, with, human, sacrifice, as, evidenced, from, human, and, animal, remains, found, during, excavations, of, the, pyramids, in, the, city, teotihuacanos, practiced, human, sacrifice, scholars, believe, that, the, people, offered, human, sacrifices, as, part, of, a, dedication, when, buildings, were, expanded, or, constructed, the, victims, were, probably, enemy, warriors, captured, in, battle, and, brought, to, the, city, for, ritual, sacrifice, to, ensure, the, city, could, prosper, some, men, were, decapitated, some, had, their, hearts, removed, others, were, killed, by, being, hit, several, times, over, the, head, and, some, were, buried, alive, animals, that, were, considered, sacred, and, represented, mythical, powers, and, the, military, were, also, buried, alive, or, captured, and, held, in, cages, such, as, cougars, a, wolf, eagles, a, falcon, an, owl, and, even, venomous, snakes, numerous, stone, masks, have, been, found, at, teotihuacan, and, have, been, generally, believed, to, have, been, used, during, a, funerary, context, however, other, scholars, call, this, into, question, noting, that, the, masks, do, not, seem, to, have, come, from, burials, teotihuacan, had, one, of, the, largest, or, perhaps, had, the, largest, population, of, any, city, in, the, basin, of, mexico, during, its, occupation, teotihuacan, was, a, large, pre, historic, city, that, underwent, massive, population, growth, and, sustained, it, over, most, of, the, city, s, occupancy, in, 100, ce, the, population, could, be, estimated, at, around, 60, 000, 80, 000, after, 200, years, of, the, city, s, occupancy, within, 20, km, 2, of, the, city, the, population, eventually, stabilized, around, 100, 000, people, around, 300, ce, the, population, reached, its, peak, numbers, around, 400, to, 500, ce, during, 400, to, 500, ce, the, xolalpan, period, the, city, s, population, was, estimated, to, be, 100, 000, to, 200, 000, people, this, number, was, achieved, by, estimating, compound, sizes, to, hold, approximately, 60, to, 100, with, 2, 000, compounds, these, high, numbers, continued, until, the, city, started, to, decline, between, 600, and, 700, ce, one, of, teotihuacan, s, neighborhoods, teopancazco, was, occupied, during, most, of, the, time, teotihuacan, was, as, well, it, showed, that, teotihuacan, was, a, multiethnic, city, that, was, broken, up, into, areas, of, different, ethnicities, and, workers, this, neighborhood, was, important, in, two, ways, the, high, infant, mortality, rate, and, the, role, of, the, different, ethnicities, the, high, infant, mortality, rate, was, important, within, the, neighborhood, and, the, city, at, large, as, there, are, a, large, number, of, perinatal, skeletons, at, teopancazco, this, suggests, that, the, population, of, teotihuacan, was, sustained, and, grew, due, to, people, coming, into, the, city, rather, than, the, population, reproducing, the, influx, of, people, came, from, surrounding, areas, bringing, different, ethnicities, to, the, city, teotihuacan, also, had, two, other, neighborhoods, that, prominently, depicted, this, multiethnic, city, picture, both, neighborhoods, contained, not, only, different, architecture, from, the, other, parts, of, teotihuacan, but, also, artifacts, and, burial, practices, that, began, the, narrative, of, these, places, archaeologists, have, also, performed, oxygen, isotope, ratio, testing, and, strontium, isotope, ratio, testing, to, determine, using, the, bones, and, the, teeth, of, the, skeletons, uncovered, whether, these, skeletons, were, native, to, teotihuacan, or, were, immigrants, to, the, city, the, oxygen, ratio, testing, can, be, used, to, determine, where, someone, grew, up, and, the, strontium, ratio, testing, can, be, used, to, determine, where, someone, was, born, and, where, they, were, living, when, they, died, these, tests, revealed, a, lot, of, information, but, specifically, enabled, clear, distinction, between, the, people, living, in, the, ethnic, neighborhoods, and, those, native, to, teotihuacan, one, neighborhood, was, called, tlailotlacan, and, was, believed, to, be, a, neighborhood, of, migrants, predominantly, from, the, oaxaca, region, the, excavations, there, featured, prominently, artifacts, in, the, zapotec, style, of, from, the, zapotec, region, including, one, tomb, with, an, antechamber, the, oxygen, isotope, ratio, testing, was, particularly, helpful, when, analyzing, this, neighborhood, because, it, painted, a, clear, picture, of, the, initial, influx, from, oaxaca, followed, by, routine, journeys, back, to, the, homeland, to, maintain, the, culture, and, heritage, of, the, following, generations, later, oxygen, isotope, ratio, testing, also, revealed, that, out, of, the, skeletons, tested, four, fifths, of, them, had, immigrated, to, the, city, or, were, born, in, the, city, but, spent, their, childhood, in, their, homeland, before, returning, to, teotihuacan, there, was, evidence, of, constant, interaction, between, teotihuacan, and, the, oaxacan, homeland, through, journeys, taken, by, children, and, mothers, keeping, the, culture, and, the, roots, to, their, homeland, alive, the, other, main, neighborhood, was, called, barrio, de, los, comerciantes, or, the, merchants, barrio, there, is, less, information, about, those, who, lived, here, or, perhaps, more, research, needs, to, be, done, but, this, neighborhood, also, had, clear, differences, from, other, areas, of, the, city, the, architecture, was, different, featuring, round, adobe, structures, as, well, as, foreign, pottery, and, artifacts, identified, as, belonging, to, the, gulf, coast, region, this, neighborhood, similarly, to, tlailotclan, saw, a, huge, influx, of, immigration, determined, by, the, strontium, isotope, ratio, testing, of, bones, and, teeth, with, people, spending, a, significant, part, of, their, lives, before, death, in, teotihuacan, there, was, a, big, find, in, the, la, ventilla, district, that, contains, over, 30, signs, and, clusters, on, the, floor, of, the, patio, much, of, the, findings, in, teotihuacan, suggest, that, the, inhabitants, had, their, own, writing, style, the, figures, were, made, quickly, and, show, control, giving, the, idea, that, they, were, practiced, and, were, adequate, for, the, needs, of, their, society, other, societies, around, teotihuacan, adopted, some, of, the, symbols, that, were, used, there, the, inhabitants, there, rarely, used, any, other, societies, symbols, and, art, these, writing, systems, were, not, anything, like, those, of, their, neighbors, but, the, same, writings, show, that, they, must, have, been, aware, of, the, other, writings, the, processing, of, obsidian, was, the, most, developed, art, and, the, main, source, of, wealth, in, teotihuacan, and, many, other, ancient, mesoamerican, cultures, the, workshops, produced, tools, or, objects, of, obsidian, of, various, uses, and, types, black, and, grey, colors, intended, for, commercial, transactions, beyond, the, geographical, boundaries, of, the, city, with, cities, such, as, monte, alban, in, oaxaca, mexico, tikal, in, guatemala, and, some, mayan, states, figurines, blades, arrowheads, spikes, knife, handles, jewelry, masks, or, ornaments, etc, were, some, of, the, most, notable, and, common, objects, constructed, obsidian, came, mainly, from, the, mines, of, pachuca, teotihuacan, and, its, processing, was, the, most, important, industry, in, the, city, which, had, acquired, the, monopoly, in, the, trade, of, obsidian, in, the, broader, middle, american, region, the, state, also, heavily, monitored, the, trade, movement, and, creation, of, obsidian, tools, as, it, was, such, an, important, industry, in, the, city, that, it, was, limited, to, the, regional, workshops, where, the, tools, were, produced, this, brittle, yet, strong, rock, was, mainly, formed, into, objects, by, flaking, off, pieces, from, a, larger, cone, but, wood, and, bone, tools, have, also, been, found, to, have, been, used, in, the, process, knowledge, of, the, huge, ruins, of, teotihuacan, was, never, completely, lost, after, the, fall, of, the, city, various, squatters, lived, on, the, site, during, aztec, times, the, city, was, a, place, of, pilgrimage, and, identified, with, the, myth, of, tollan, the, place, where, the, sun, was, created, today, teotihuacan, is, one, of, the, most, noted, archeological, attractions, in, mexico, in, the, late, 17th, century, carlos, de, sig, enza, y, g, ngora, 1645, 1700, made, some, excavations, around, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, minor, archeological, excavations, were, conducted, in, the, 19th, century, in, 1905, mexican, archeologist, and, government, official, in, the, regime, of, porfirio, d, az, leopoldo, batres, led, a, major, project, of, excavation, and, restoration, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, was, restored, to, celebrate, the, centennial, of, the, mexican, war, of, independence, in, 1910, the, site, of, teotihuacan, was, the, first, to, be, expropriated, for, the, national, patrimony, under, the, law, of, monuments, 1897, giving, jurisdiction, under, legislation, for, the, mexican, state, to, take, control, some, 250, plots, were, farmed, on, the, site, peasants, who, had, been, farming, portions, were, ordered, to, leave, and, the, mexican, government, eventually, paid, some, compensation, to, those, individuals, a, feeder, train, line, was, built, to, the, site, in, 1908, which, allowed, the, efficient, hauling, of, material, from, the, excavations, and, later, brought, tourists, to, the, site, in, 1910, the, international, congress, of, americanists, met, in, mexico, coinciding, with, the, centennial, celebrations, and, the, distinguished, delegates, such, as, its, president, eduard, seler, and, vice, president, franz, boas, were, taken, to, the, newly, finished, excavations, further, excavations, at, the, ciudadela, were, carried, out, in, the, 1920s, supervised, by, manuel, gamio, between, april, 26, and, july, 29, 1932, swedish, anthropologist, archaeologist, sigvald, linn, his, wife, and, a, small, crew, excavated, in, the, xolalpan, area, part, of, the, municipality, of, san, juan, teotihuac, n, other, sections, of, the, site, were, excavated, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, the, first, site, wide, project, of, restoration, and, excavation, was, carried, out, by, inah, from, 1960, to, 1965, supervised, by, jorge, acosta, this, undertaking, had, the, goals, of, clearing, the, avenue, of, the, dead, consolidating, the, structures, facing, it, and, excavating, the, palace, of, quetzalpapalotl, during, the, installation, of, a, sound, and, light, show, in, 1971, workers, discovered, the, entrance, to, a, tunnel, and, cave, system, underneath, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, although, scholars, long, thought, this, to, be, a, natural, cave, more, recent, examinations, have, established, the, tunnel, was, entirely, manmade, the, interior, of, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, has, never, been, fully, excavated, in, 1980, 82, another, major, program, of, excavation, and, restoration, was, carried, out, at, the, pyramid, of, the, feathered, serpent, and, the, avenue, of, the, dead, complex, most, recently, a, series, of, excavations, at, the, pyramid, of, the, moon, have, greatly, expanded, evidence, of, cultural, practices, in, late, 2003, a, tunnel, beneath, the, temple, of, the, feathered, serpent, was, accidentally, discovered, by, sergio, g, mez, ch, vez, and, julie, gazzola, archeologists, of, the, national, institute, of, anthropology, and, history, inah, after, days, of, a, heavy, rainstorm, g, mez, ch, vez, noticed, that, a, nearly, three, foot, wide, sinkhole, occurred, near, the, foot, of, the, temple, pyramid, first, trying, to, examine, the, hole, with, a, flashlight, from, above, g, mez, could, see, only, darkness, so, tied, with, a, line, of, heavy, rope, around, his, waist, he, was, lowered, by, several, colleagues, and, descending, into, the, murk, he, realized, it, was, a, perfectly, cylindrical, shaft, at, the, bottom, he, came, to, rest, in, an, apparently, ancient, construction, a, man, made, tunnel, blocked, in, both, directions, by, immense, stones, g, mez, was, aware, that, archeologists, had, previously, discovered, a, narrow, tunnel, underneath, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, and, supposed, he, was, now, observing, a, kind, of, similar, mirror, tunnel, leading, to, a, subterranean, chamber, beneath, the, temple, of, the, feathered, serpent, he, decided, initially, to, elaborate, on, a, clear, hypothesis, and, to, obtain, approval, meanwhile, he, erected, a, tent, over, the, sinkhole, to, preserve, it, from, the, hundreds, of, thousands, of, tourists, who, visit, teotihuac, n, researchers, reported, that, the, tunnel, was, believed, to, have, been, sealed, in, 200, ce, preliminary, planning, of, the, exploration, and, fundraising, took, more, than, six, years, before, the, start, of, excavations, beginning, in, the, early, months, of, 2004, victor, manuel, velasco, herrera, from, unam, institute, of, geophysics, determined, with, the, help, of, ground, penetrating, radar, gpr, and, a, team, of, some, 20, archeologists, and, workers, the, approximate, length, of, the, tunnel, and, the, presence, of, internal, chambers, they, scanned, the, earth, under, the, ciudadela, returning, every, afternoon, to, upload, the, results, to, g, mez, s, computers, by, 2005, the, digital, map, was, complete, the, archeologists, explored, the, tunnel, with, a, remote, controlled, robot, called, tlaloc, ii, tc, equipped, with, an, infrared, camera, and, a, laser, scanner, that, generates, 3d, visualization, to, perform, three, dimensional, register, of, the, spaces, beneath, the, temple, a, small, opening, in, the, tunnel, wall, was, made, and, the, scanner, captured, the, first, images, 37, meters, into, the, passage, in, 2009, the, government, granted, g, mez, permission, to, dig, by, the, end, of, 2009, archeologists, of, the, inah, located, the, entrance, to, the, tunnel, that, leads, to, galleries, under, the, pyramid, where, remains, of, rulers, of, the, ancient, city, might, have, been, deposited, in, august, 2010, g, mez, ch, vez, now, director, of, tlalocan, project, underground, road, announced, that, inah, s, investigation, of, the, tunnel, closed, nearly, 1, 800, years, ago, by, teotihuacan, dwellers, will, proceed, the, inah, team, consisting, of, about, 30, people, supported, by, national, and, international, advisors, at, the, highest, scientific, levels, intended, to, enter, the, tunnel, in, september, october, 2010, this, excavation, the, deepest, made, at, the, pre, hispanic, site, was, part, of, the, commemorations, of, the, 100th, anniversary, of, archeological, excavations, at, teotihuacan, and, its, opening, to, the, public, it, was, mentioned, that, the, underground, passage, runs, under, feathered, serpent, temple, and, the, entrance, is, located, a, few, meters, away, from, the, temple, at, the, expected, place, deliberately, sealed, with, large, boulders, nearly, 2, 000, years, ago, the, hole, that, had, appeared, during, the, 2003, storms, was, not, the, actual, entrance, a, vertical, shaft, of, almost, 5, meters, by, side, is, the, access, to, the, tunnel, at, 14, meters, deep, the, entrance, leads, to, a, nearly, 100, meter, long, corridor, that, ends, in, a, series, of, underground, galleries, in, the, rock, after, archeologists, broke, ground, at, the, entrance, of, the, tunnel, a, staircase, and, ladders, that, would, allow, easy, access, to, the, subterranean, site, were, installed, works, advanced, slowly, and, with, painstaking, care, excavating, was, done, manually, with, spades, nearly, 1, 000, tons, of, soil, and, debris, were, removed, from, the, tunnel, there, were, large, spiral, seashells, cat, bones, pottery, fragments, of, human, skin, the, rich, array, of, objects, unearthed, included, wooden, masks, covered, with, inlaid, rock, jade, and, quartz, elaborate, necklaces, rings, greenstone, crocodile, teeth, and, human, figurines, crystals, shaped, into, eyes, beetle, wings, arranged, in, a, box, sculptures, of, jaguars, and, hundreds, of, metalized, spheres, the, mysterious, globes, lay, in, both, the, north, and, south, chambers, ranging, from, 40, to, 130, millimeters, the, balls, have, a, core, of, clay, and, are, covered, with, a, yellow, jarosite, formed, by, the, oxidation, of, pyrite, according, to, george, cowgill, of, arizona, state, university, the, spheres, are, a, fascinating, find, pyrite, was, certainly, used, by, the, teotihuacanos, and, other, ancient, mesoamerican, societies, originally, the, spheres, would, have, shown, brilliantly, they, are, indeed, unique, but, i, have, no, idea, what, they, mean, all, these, artifacts, were, deposited, deliberately, and, pointedly, as, if, in, offering, to, appease, the, gods, one, of, the, most, remarkable, findings, in, the, tunnel, chambers, was, a, miniature, mountainous, landscape, 17, meters, underground, with, tiny, pools, of, liquid, mercury, representing, lakes, the, walls, and, ceiling, of, the, tunnel, were, found, to, have, been, carefully, impregnated, with, mineral, powder, composed, of, magnetite, pyrite, fool, s, gold, and, hematite, to, provide, a, glittering, brightness, to, the, complex, and, to, create, the, effect, of, standing, under, the, stars, as, a, peculiar, re, creation, of, the, underworld, at, the, end, of, the, passage, g, mez, ch, vez, s, team, uncovered, four, greenstone, statues, wearing, garments, and, beads, their, open, eyes, would, have, shone, with, precious, minerals, two, of, the, figurines, were, still, in, their, original, positions, leaning, back, and, appearing, to, contemplate, up, at, the, axis, where, the, three, planes, of, the, universe, meet, likely, the, founding, shamans, of, teotihuacan, guiding, pilgrims, to, the, sanctuary, and, carrying, bundles, of, sacred, objects, used, to, perform, rituals, including, pendants, and, pyrite, mirrors, which, were, perceived, as, portals, to, other, realms, after, each, new, segment, was, cleared, the, 3d, scanner, documented, the, progress, by, 2015, nearly, 75, 000, fragments, of, artifacts, have, been, discovered, studied, cataloged, analyzed, and, when, possible, restored, the, significance, of, these, new, discoveries, is, publicly, explored, in, a, major, exhibition, at, the, de, young, museum, in, san, francisco, which, opened, in, late, september, 2017, a, recent, discovery, of, an, 1800, year, old, bouquet, of, flowers, was, made, in, 2021, the, flowers, which, were, found, in, the, tunnel, beneath, a, pyramid, dedicated, to, the, feathered, serpent, deity, quetzalc, atl, date, to, between, roughly, 1, and, 200, c, e, it, is, the, first, time, such, a, well, preserved, plant, matter, has, been, discovered, at, teotihuacan, the, city, of, teotihuacan, was, characterized, by, large, and, imposing, buildings, which, included, apart, from, the, complexes, of, houses, temples, large, squares, stadiums, and, palaces, of, the, rulers, nobles, and, priests, the, city, s, urban, ceremonial, space, is, considered, one, of, the, most, impressive, achievements, of, the, pre, columbian, new, world, the, size, and, quality, of, the, monuments, the, originality, of, the, residential, architecture, and, the, miraculous, iconography, in, the, colored, murals, of, the, buildings, or, the, vases, with, the, paintings, of, butterflies, eagles, coyotes, with, feathers, and, jaguars, suggest, beyond, any, doubt, a, high, level, civilization, whose, cultural, influences, were, spread, and, transplanted, into, all, the, mesoamerican, populations, the, main, monuments, of, the, city, of, teotihuacan, are, connected, to, each, other, by, a, central, road, of, 45, meters, wide, and, a, length, of, 2, kilometers, called, avenue, of, the, dead, avenida, de, los, muertos, because, it, is, believed, to, have, been, paved, with, tombs, east, is, the, imposing, pyramid, of, the, sun, piramide, del, sol, the, third, largest, pyramid, in, the, world, it, has, a, volume, of, 1, million, cubic, meters, it, is, a, gradual, pyramid, with, a, base, dimension, of, 219, 4, x, 231, 6, meters, and, a, height, of, 65, meters, at, the, top, of, the, pyramid, there, was, a, huge, pedestal, where, human, sacrifices, were, made, at, the, north, end, of, the, city, the, boulevard, of, the, dead, ends, in, the, pyramid, of, the, moon, piramide, de, la, luna, surrounded, laterally, by, platforms, ramps, and, lower, pyramids, in, the, southern, part, is, the, temple, of, cetzalkokal, quetzalcoatl, dedicated, to, god, in, the, form, of, a, winged, serpent, which, gives, life, and, fertility, sculpture, representation, of, the, god, ketzalkokal, and, twelve, heads, of, winged, snakes, adorn, the, two, sides, of, the, uphill, scale, of, the, temple, the, city, s, broad, central, avenue, called, avenue, of, the, dead, a, translation, from, its, nahuatl, name, miccoatli, is, flanked, by, impressive, ceremonial, architecture, including, the, immense, pyramid, of, the, sun, third, largest, in, the, world, after, the, great, pyramid, of, cholula, and, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, pyramid, of, the, moon, and, the, ciudadela, with, temple, of, the, feathered, serpent, quetzalcoatl, are, placed, at, both, ends, of, the, avenue, while, palace, museum, quetzalpap, lot, the, fourth, basic, structure, of, the, site, is, situated, between, two, main, pyramids, along, the, avenue, are, many, smaller, talud, tablero, platforms, as, well, the, aztecs, believed, they, were, tombs, inspiring, the, name, of, the, avenue, scholars, have, now, established, that, these, were, ceremonial, platforms, that, were, topped, with, temples, the, avenue, of, the, dead, is, roughly, 40, meters, wide, and, 4, km, long, further, down, the, avenue, of, the, dead, after, a, small, river, is, the, area, known, as, the, citadel, containing, the, ruined, temple, of, the, feathered, serpent, quetzalcoatl, this, area, was, a, large, plaza, surrounded, by, temples, that, formed, the, religious, and, political, center, of, the, city, the, name, citadel, was, given, to, it, by, the, spanish, who, believed, it, was, a, fort, most, of, the, common, people, lived, in, large, apartment, buildings, spread, across, the, city, many, of, the, buildings, contained, workshops, where, artisans, produced, pottery, and, other, goods, the, urban, layout, of, teotihuacan, exhibits, two, slightly, different, orientations, which, resulted, from, both, astronomical, and, topographic, criteria, the, central, part, of, the, city, including, the, avenue, of, the, dead, conforms, to, the, orientation, of, the, sun, pyramid, while, the, southern, part, reproduces, the, orientation, of, the, ciudadela, the, two, constructions, recorded, sunrises, and, sunsets, on, particular, dates, allowing, the, use, of, an, observational, calendar, the, orientation, of, the, sun, pyramid, was, intended, to, record, the, sunrises, on, february, 11, and, october, 29, and, sunsets, on, april, 30, and, august, 13, the, interval, from, february, 11, and, october, 29, as, well, as, from, august, 13, to, april, 30, is, exactly, 260, days, the, recorded, intervals, are, multiples, of, 13, and, 20, days, which, were, elementary, periods, of, the, mesoamerican, calendar, furthermore, the, sun, pyramid, is, aligned, to, cerro, gordo, to, the, north, which, means, that, it, was, purposefully, built, on, a, spot, where, a, structure, with, a, rectangular, ground, plan, could, satisfy, both, topographic, and, astronomical, requirements, the, artificial, cave, under, the, pyramid, additionally, attests, to, the, importance, of, this, spot, another, example, of, artificial, landscape, modifications, is, the, course, of, the, san, juan, river, which, was, modified, to, bend, around, the, structures, as, it, goes, through, the, center, of, town, eventually, returning, to, its, natural, course, outside, of, teotihuacan, pecked, cross, circles, throughout, the, city, and, in, the, surrounding, regions, served, as, a, way, to, design, the, urban, grid, and, as, a, way, to, read, their, 260, day, calendar, the, urban, grid, had, great, significance, to, city, planners, when, constructing, teotihuacan, as, the, cross, is, pecked, into, the, ground, in, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, in, specific, places, throughout, teotihuacan, in, precise, degrees, and, angles, over, three, km, in, distance, the, layout, of, these, crosses, suggests, it, was, there, to, work, as, a, grid, to, the, layout, of, teotihuacan, because, they, are, laid, out, in, a, rectangular, shape, facing, the, avenue, of, the, dead, the, direction, of, the, axes, of, the, crosses, don, t, point, to, an, astronomical, north, and, south, direction, but, instead, point, to, their, own, city, s, north, numerology, also, has, significance, in, the, cross, pecking, because, of, the, placement, and, amount, of, the, holes, which, sometimes, count, to, 260, days, the, length, of, the, ritual, calendrical, cycle, some, of, the, pecked, cross, circles, also, resemble, an, ancient, aztec, game, called, patolli, these, pecked, cross, circles, can, be, found, not, just, in, teotihuacan, but, also, throughout, mesoamerica, the, ones, found, all, share, certain, similarities, these, include, having, the, shape, of, two, circles, one, being, inside, of, the, other, they, are, all, found, pecked, on, the, ground, or, onto, rocks, they, are, all, created, with, a, small, hammer, like, device, that, produces, cuplike, markings, that, are, 1, centimeter, in, diameter, and, 2, centimeters, apart, they, all, have, axes, that, are, in, line, with, the, city, structures, of, the, region, because, they, are, aligned, with, the, structures, of, the, cities, they, also, align, with, the, position, of, significant, astronomical, bodies, the, ciudadela, was, completed, during, the, miccaotli, phase, and, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, underwent, a, complex, series, of, additions, and, renovations, the, great, compound, was, constructed, across, the, avenue, of, the, dead, west, of, ciudadela, this, was, probably, the, city, s, marketplace, the, existence, of, a, large, market, in, an, urban, center, of, this, size, is, strong, evidence, of, state, organization, teotihuacan, was, at, that, point, simply, too, large, and, too, complex, to, have, been, politically, viable, as, a, chiefdom, the, ciudadela, is, a, great, enclosed, plaza, capable, of, holding, 100, 000, people, about, 700, 000, cubic, meters, yards, of, material, were, used, to, construct, its, buildings, its, central, feature, is, the, temple, of, quetzalcoatl, which, was, flanked, by, upper, class, apartments, the, entire, compound, was, designed, to, overwhelm, visitors, the, archeological, park, of, teotihuacan, is, under, threat, from, development, pressures, in, 2004, the, governor, of, mexico, state, arturo, montiel, gave, permission, for, wal, mart, to, build, a, large, store, in, the, third, archeological, zone, of, the, park, according, to, sergio, g, mez, ch, vez, an, archeologist, and, researcher, for, mexico, s, national, institute, of, anthropology, and, history, inah, fragments, of, ancient, pottery, were, found, where, trucks, dumped, the, soil, from, the, site, more, recently, teotihuacan, has, become, the, center, of, controversy, over, resplandor, teotihuacan, a, massive, light, and, sound, spectacular, installed, to, create, a, nighttime, show, for, tourists, critics, explain, that, a, large, number, of, perforations, for, the, project, have, caused, fractures, in, stones, and, irreversible, damage, while, the, project, will, have, limited, benefit, in, may, 2021, the, secretariat, of, culture, announced, that, a, construction, crew, had, been, bulldozing, the, northern, outskirts, of, the, city, ruins, in, order, to, develop, the, land, for, an, amusement, park, despite, three, months, worth, of, orders, from, the, government, to, stop, work, the, report, detailed, that, at, least, 25, archeological, structures, were, in, immediate, danger, on, may, 31, 2021, 250, national, guard, troops, and, 60, agents, of, the, attorney, general, s, office, were, sent, to, the, teotihuac, n, site, to, seize, parcels, of, land, intended, for, illegal, construction, and, to, forcibly, stop, further, destruction, of, historical, sites, the, national, institute, of, anthropology, and, history, inah, had, suspended, authorization, for, those, projects, in, march, yet, construction, work, with, heavy, machinery, and, looting, of, artifacts, had, continued, the, seizure, of, the, land, came, a, week, after, the, international, council, on, monuments, and, sites, icomos, warned, that, teotihuac, n, was, at, risk, of, losing, its, unesco, world, heritage, designation
