aromatic, resins, blackwood, ebony, ivory, and, wild, animals, recent, evidence, locates, it, in, northwestern, eritrea, it, is, possible, that, it, includes, or, corresponds, to, opone, as, later, known, by, the, ancient, greeks, while, some, biblical, scholars, have, identified, it, with, the, biblical, land, of, put, or, havilah, at, times, punt, is, referred, to, as, ta, netjer, t, n, r, lit, land, of, the, god, the, exact, location, of, punt, is, debated, by, historians, various, locations, have, been, offered, southeast, of, egypt, a, coastal, region, south, of, it, along, the, red, sea, gulf, of, aden, and, the, indian, ocean, in, present, day, north, east, sudan, eritrea, northeast, ethiopia, djibouti, and, northern, somalia, including, somaliland, it, is, also, possible, that, it, covered, both, the, horn, of, africa, and, the, area, across, the, sea, in, southern, arabia, the, autonomous, state, of, puntland, the, modern, day, somali, administrative, region, at, the, tip, of, the, horn, of, africa, is, named, in, honor, of, this, ancient, kingdom, the, earliest, recorded, ancient, egyptian, expedition, to, punt, was, organized, by, pharaoh, sahure, of, the, fifth, dynasty, 25th, century, bc, returning, with, cargoes, of, antyue, and, puntites, however, gold, from, punt, is, recorded, as, having, been, in, egypt, as, early, as, the, time, of, pharaoh, khufu, of, the, fourth, dynasty, subsequently, there, were, more, expeditions, to, punt, in, the, sixth, eleventh, twelfth, and, eighteenth, dynasties, of, egypt, in, the, twelfth, dynasty, trade, with, punt, was, celebrated, in, popular, literature, in, the, tale, of, the, shipwrecked, sailor, in, the, reign, of, mentuhotep, iii, 11th, dynasty, ca, 2000, bc, an, officer, named, hannu, organized, one, or, more, voyages, to, punt, but, it, is, uncertain, whether, he, personally, traveled, on, these, expeditions, trading, missions, of, the, 12th, dynasty, pharaohs, senusret, i, amenemhat, ii, and, amenemhat, iv, had, also, successfully, navigated, their, way, to, and, from, the, mysterious, land, of, punt, in, the, eighteenth, dynasty, of, egypt, hatshepsut, built, a, red, sea, fleet, to, facilitate, trade, between, the, head, of, the, gulf, of, aqaba, and, points, south, as, far, as, punt, to, bring, mortuary, goods, to, karnak, in, exchange, for, nubian, gold, hatshepsut, personally, made, the, most, famous, ancient, egyptian, expedition, that, sailed, to, punt, her, artists, revealing, much, about, the, royals, inhabitants, habitation, and, variety, of, trees, on, the, island, revealing, it, as, the, land, of, the, gods, a, region, far, to, the, east, in, the, direction, of, the, sunrise, blessed, with, products, for, religious, purposes, where, traders, returned, with, gold, ivory, ebony, incense, aromatic, resins, animal, skins, live, animals, eye, makeup, cosmetics, fragrant, woods, and, cinnamon, during, the, reign, of, queen, hatshepsut, in, the, 15th, century, bc, ships, regularly, crossed, the, red, sea, in, order, to, obtain, bitumen, copper, carved, amulets, naptha, and, other, goods, transported, overland, and, down, the, dead, sea, to, elat, at, the, head, of, the, gulf, of, aqaba, where, they, were, joined, with, frankincense, and, myrrh, coming, north, both, by, sea, and, overland, along, trade, routes, through, the, mountains, running, north, along, the, east, coast, of, the, red, sea, a, report, of, that, five, ship, voyage, survives, on, reliefs, in, hatshepsut, s, mortuary, temple, at, deir, el, bahri, throughout, the, temple, texts, hatshepsut, maintains, the, fiction, that, her, envoy, chancellor, nehsi, who, is, mentioned, as, the, head, of, the, expedition, had, travelled, to, punt, in, order, to, extract, tribute, from, the, natives, who, admit, their, allegiance, to, the, egyptian, pharaoh, in, reality, nehsi, s, expedition, was, a, simple, trading, mission, to, a, land, punt, which, was, by, this, time, a, well, established, trading, post, moreover, nehsi, s, visit, to, punt, was, not, inordinately, brave, since, he, was, accompanied, by, at, least, five, shiploads, of, marines, and, greeted, warmly, by, the, chief, of, punt, and, his, immediate, family, the, puntites, traded, not, only, in, their, own, produce, of, incense, ebony, and, short, horned, cattle, but, in, goods, from, other, african, states, including, gold, ivory, and, animal, skins, according, to, the, temple, reliefs, the, land, of, punt, was, ruled, at, that, time, by, king, parahu, and, queen, ati, this, well, illustrated, expedition, of, hatshepsut, occurred, in, year, 9, of, the, female, pharaoh, s, reign, with, the, blessing, of, the, god, amun, said, by, amen, the, lord, of, the, thrones, of, the, two, land, come, come, in, peace, my, daughter, the, graceful, who, art, in, my, heart, king, maatkare, i, will, give, thee, punt, the, whole, of, it, i, will, lead, your, soldiers, by, land, and, by, water, on, mysterious, shores, which, join, the, harbours, of, incense, they, will, take, incense, as, much, as, they, like, they, will, load, their, ships, to, the, satisfaction, of, their, hearts, with, trees, of, green, incense, and, all, the, good, things, of, the, land, while, the, egyptians, were, not, particularly, well, versed, in, the, hazards, of, sea, travel, and, the, long, voyage, to, punt, must, have, seemed, something, akin, to, a, journey, to, the, moon, for, present, day, explorers, the, rewards, of, clearly, outweighed, the, risks, an, extensive, account, of, the, expedition, based, on, the, tableaux, was, provided, by, amelia, edwards, in, 1891, according, to, stuart, tyson, smith, egyptologist, and, professor, of, anthropology, at, university, of, california, santa, barbara, the, scene, of, an, expedition, to, punt, from, queen, hatshepsuis, mortuary, complex, at, deir, el, bahri, shows, puntites, with, red, skin, and, facial, features, similar, to, egyptians, long, or, bobbed, hair, goatee, beards, and, kilts, hatshepsut, s, 18th, dynasty, successors, such, as, thutmose, iii, and, amenhotep, iii, also, continued, the, egyptian, tradition, of, trading, with, punt, the, trade, with, punt, continued, into, the, start, of, the, 20th, dynasty, before, terminating, prior, to, the, end, of, egypt, s, new, kingdom, papyrus, harris, i, a, contemporary, egyptian, document, that, details, events, that, occurred, in, the, reign, of, the, early, 20th, dynasty, king, ramesses, iii, includes, an, explicit, description, of, an, egyptian, expedition, s, return, from, punt, they, arrived, safely, at, the, desert, country, of, coptos, they, moored, in, peace, carrying, the, goods, they, had, brought, were, loaded, in, travelling, overland, upon, asses, and, upon, men, being, reloaded, into, vessels, at, the, harbour, of, coptos, were, sent, forward, downstream, arriving, in, festivity, bringing, tribute, into, the, royal, presence, after, the, end, of, the, new, kingdom, period, punt, became, an, unreal, and, fabulous, land, of, myths, and, legends, however, egyptians, continued, to, compose, love, songs, about, punt, when, i, hold, my, love, close, and, her, arms, steal, around, me, i, m, like, a, man, translated, to, punt, or, like, someone, out, in, the, reedflats, when, the, world, suddenly, bursts, into, flower, at, times, the, ancient, egyptians, called, punt, ta, netjer, t, n, r, meaning, god, s, land, this, referred, to, the, fact, that, it, was, among, the, regions, of, the, sun, god, that, is, the, regions, located, in, the, direction, of, the, sunrise, to, the, east, of, egypt, these, eastern, regions, resources, included, products, used, in, temples, notably, incense, older, literature, maintained, that, the, label, god, s, land, when, interpreted, as, holy, land, or, land, of, the, gods, ancestors, meant, that, the, ancient, egyptians, viewed, the, land, of, punt, as, their, ancestral, homeland, w, m, flinders, petrie, believed, that, the, dynastic, race, came, from, or, through, punt, and, that, pan, or, punt, was, a, district, at, the, south, end, of, the, red, sea, which, probably, embraced, both, the, african, and, arabian, shores, moreover, e, a, wallis, budge, stated, that, egyptian, tradition, of, the, dynastic, period, held, that, the, aboriginal, home, of, the, egyptians, was, punt, james, breasted, in, 1906, argued, that, the, term, ta, netjer, was, not, only, applied, to, punt, located, southeast, of, egypt, but, also, to, regions, of, asia, east, and, northeast, of, egypt, such, as, lebanon, which, was, the, source, of, wood, for, temples, on, the, murals, of, the, hatshepsut, temple, at, deir, el, bahri, the, king, and, queen, of, punt, are, depicted, along, with, their, retinue, due, to, her, unusual, appearance, the, queen, was, sometimes, hypothesized, to, have, had, advanced, steatopygia, or, elephantiasis, the, majority, opinion, places, punt, in, the, horn, of, africa, based, on, the, fact, that, the, products, of, punt, as, depicted, in, the, hatshepsut, illustrations, were, abundantly, found, in, the, horn, of, africa, but, were, less, common, or, sometimes, absent, in, arabia, these, products, included, gold, and, aromatic, resins, such, as, myrrh, frankincense, and, ebony, the, wild, animals, depicted, in, punt, included, giraffes, baboons, hippopotami, and, leopards, richard, pankhurst, states, has, been, identified, with, territory, on, both, the, arabian, and, the, horn, of, africa, coasts, consideration, of, the, articles, that, the, egyptians, obtained, from, punt, notably, gold, and, ivory, suggests, however, that, these, were, primarily, of, african, origin, this, leads, us, to, suppose, that, the, term, punt, probably, applied, more, to, african, than, arabian, territory, in, 2003, ian, shaw, wrote, that, there, is, still, some, debate, regarding, the, precise, location, of, punt, which, was, once, identified, with, the, region, of, modern, somalia, a, strong, argument, has, now, been, made, for, its, location, in, either, southern, sudan, or, the, eritrean, region, of, ethiopia, where, the, indigenous, plants, and, animals, equate, most, closely, with, those, depicted, in, the, egyptian, reliefs, and, paintings, according, to, simon, najovits, the, area, comprising, somalia, djibouti, the, red, sea, coast, of, eritrea, and, sudan, in, the, horn, of, africa, is, considered, the, most, likely, location, in, 2010, researchers, from, the, university, of, california, santa, cruz, analyzed, hair, from, two, mummified, baboons, using, oxygen, isotope, analysis, and, were, able, to, work, out, where, they, originated, the, researchers, compared, the, oxygen, isotope, samples, in, the, ancient, baboons, to, those, found, in, their, modern, day, brethren, the, isotope, samples, in, baboons, in, somalia, and, yemen, did, not, match, but, those, in, eritrea, and, eastern, ethiopia, did, match, the, research, team, concluded, that, punt, was, most, likely, a, circumscribed, region, that, included, eastern, ethiopia, and, all, of, eritrea, in, june, 2018, polish, archaeologists, who, have, been, conducting, research, in, the, temple, of, hatshepsut, since, 1961, discovered, the, only, depiction, of, a, secretary, bird, sagittarius, serpentarius, known, from, ancient, egypt, in, the, bas, reliefs, from, the, portico, of, punt, that, depicted, the, great, pharaonic, expedition, to, the, land, of, punt, in, december, 2020, primatologists, from, dartmouth, college, examined, tissues, from, mummified, baboons, recovered, from, new, kingdom, and, ptolemaic, sites, in, egypt, that, were, believed, to, have, come, from, punt, the, study, revealed, that, the, mummified, baboons, were, all, born, outside, of, egypt, and, were, hamadryas, baboons, the, hamadryas, baboon, is, a, species, of, baboon, native, to, the, horn, of, africa, and, the, southwestern, tip, of, the, arabian, peninsula, the, strontium, ration, in, the, tooth, enamel, confirmed, that, the, baboons, were, born, in, an, area, stretching, across, present, day, eritrea, ethiopia, and, north, western, somalia, it, has, been, suggested, that, punt, might, be, located, in, eastern, sudan, and, western, eritrea, where, the, gash, group, about, 3000, to, 1800, bc, and, later, the, jebel, mokram, group, flourished, especially, at, gash, group, sites, many, egyptian, pottery, vessels, and, egyptian, faience, beads, were, found, indicating, close, contacts, with, egypt, found, red, sea, shells, demonstrate, contact, with, the, red, sea, coast, a, news, website, in, 2023, published, evidence, that, dna, taken, from, mummified, baboons, may, have, shown, where, punt, was, in, eritrea, a, primarily, german, team, of, researchers, published, the, results, of, extracting, mitochondrial, dna, from, a, mummified, baboon, by, comparing, that, with, mitochondrial, dna, extracted, from, 14, museum, specimen, baboons, from, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, with, known, provenances, they, concluded, that, the, mummified, baboon, came, from, modern, day, eritrea, as, the, mummified, baboon, dates, from, a, period, when, egypt, was, trading, with, punt, it, may, be, assumed, to, come, from, there, and, the, authors, suggested, but, were, unable, to, prove, that, punt, is, likely, to, be, the, same, as, the, later, classical, port, city, of, adulis, dimitri, meeks, disagrees, with, the, horn, of, africa, hypothesis, and, points, to, ancient, inscriptions, that, locate, punt, in, the, western, coast, of, the, arabian, peninsula, from, the, gulf, of, aqaba, to, yemen, he, has, written, that, texts, locating, punt, beyond, doubt, to, the, south, are, in, the, minority, but, they, are, the, only, ones, cited, in, the, current, consensus, about, the, location, of, the, country, punt, we, are, told, by, the, egyptians, is, situated, in, relation, to, the, nile, valley, both, to, the, north, in, contact, with, the, countries, of, the, near, east, of, the, mediterranean, area, and, also, to, the, east, or, south, east, while, its, furthest, borders, are, far, away, to, the, south, only, the, arabian, peninsula, satisfies, all, these, indications, some, scholars, have, argued, that, punt, is, the, early, pandyan, island, of, tamraparni, present, day, sri, lanka, an, artifact, datable, to, the, fifth, dynasty, was, originally, stated, to, be, made, from, diospyros, ebenum, wood, a, tree, which, is, originally, of, southern, india, and, sri, lanka, however, such, identification, is, now, considered, unconfirmed, because, of, the, unlikelihood, of, such, an, early, contact, between, egypt, and, the, indian, subcontinent, together, with, the, difficulty, of, correctly, identifying, a, plant, specimen, dead, for, thousands, of, years
