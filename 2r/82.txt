the, iron, age, is, the, final, epoch, of, the, three, historical, metal, ages, after, the, chalcolithic, and, bronze, age, it, has, also, been, considered, as, the, final, age, of, the, three, age, division, starting, with, prehistory, before, recorded, history, and, progressing, to, protohistory, before, written, history, in, this, usage, it, is, preceded, by, the, stone, age, subdivided, into, the, paleolithic, mesolithic, and, neolithic, and, bronze, age, these, concepts, originated, for, describing, iron, age, europe, and, the, ancient, near, east, the, indigenous, cultures, of, the, new, world, did, not, develop, an, iron, economy, before, 1500, although, meteoric, iron, has, been, used, for, millennia, in, many, regions, the, beginning, of, the, iron, age, is, defined, locally, around, the, world, by, archaeological, convention, when, the, production, of, smelted, iron, especially, steel, tools, and, weapons, replaces, their, bronze, equivalents, in, common, use, in, anatolia, and, the, caucasus, or, southeast, europe, the, iron, age, began, during, the, late, 2nd, millennium, bc, c, 1300, bc, in, the, ancient, near, east, this, transition, occurred, simultaneously, with, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, during, the, 12th, century, bc, 1200, 1100, bc, the, technology, soon, spread, throughout, the, mediterranean, basin, region, and, to, south, asia, between, the, 12th, and, 11th, century, bc, its, further, spread, to, central, asia, eastern, europe, and, central, europe, was, somewhat, delayed, and, northern, europe, was, not, reached, until, about, the, start, of, the, 5th, century, bc, 500, bc, the, iron, age, in, india, is, stated, as, beginning, with, the, ironworking, painted, grey, ware, culture, dating, from, the, 15th, century, bc, through, to, the, reign, of, ashoka, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, term, iron, age, in, the, archaeology, of, south, east, and, southeast, asia, is, more, recent, and, less, common, than, for, western, eurasia, africa, did, not, have, a, universal, bronze, age, and, many, areas, transitioned, directly, from, stone, to, iron, some, archaeologists, believe, that, iron, metallurgy, was, developed, in, sub, saharan, africa, independently, from, eurasia, and, neighbouring, parts, of, northeast, africa, as, early, as, 2000, bc, the, concept, of, the, iron, age, ending, with, the, beginning, of, the, written, historiographical, record, has, not, generalized, well, as, written, language, and, steel, use, have, developed, at, different, times, in, different, areas, across, the, archaeological, record, for, instance, in, china, written, history, started, before, iron, smelting, began, so, the, term, is, used, infrequently, for, the, archaeology, of, china, for, the, ancient, near, east, the, establishment, of, the, achaemenid, empire, c, 550, bc, is, used, traditionally, and, still, usually, as, an, end, date, later, dates, are, considered, historical, according, to, the, record, by, herodotus, despite, considerable, written, records, now, being, known, from, well, back, into, the, bronze, age, in, central, and, western, europe, the, roman, conquests, of, the, 1st, century, bc, serve, as, marking, the, end, of, the, iron, age, the, germanic, iron, age, of, scandinavia, is, considered, to, end, c, ad, 800, with, the, beginning, of, the, viking, age, the, three, age, method, of, stone, bronze, and, iron, ages, was, first, used, for, the, archaeology, of, europe, during, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, by, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, it, had, been, extended, to, the, archaeology, of, the, ancient, near, east, its, name, harks, back, to, the, mythological, ages, of, man, of, hesiod, as, an, archaeological, era, it, was, first, introduced, to, scandinavia, by, christian, j, rgensen, thomsen, during, the, 1830s, by, the, 1860s, it, was, embraced, as, a, useful, division, of, the, earliest, history, of, mankind, in, general, and, began, to, be, applied, in, assyriology, the, development, of, the, now, conventional, periodization, in, the, archaeology, of, the, ancient, near, east, was, developed, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, meteoric, iron, a, natural, iron, nickel, alloy, was, used, by, various, ancient, peoples, thousands, of, years, before, the, iron, age, the, earliest, known, meteoric, iron, artifacts, are, nine, small, beads, dated, to, 3200, bc, which, were, found, in, burials, at, gerzeh, in, lower, egypt, having, been, shaped, by, careful, hammering, the, characteristic, of, an, iron, age, culture, is, the, mass, production, of, tools, and, weapons, made, not, just, of, found, iron, but, from, smelted, steel, alloys, with, an, added, carbon, content, only, with, the, capability, of, the, production, of, carbon, steel, does, ferrous, metallurgy, result, in, tools, or, weapons, that, are, harder, and, lighter, than, bronze, smelted, iron, appears, sporadically, in, the, archeological, record, from, the, middle, bronze, age, whilst, terrestrial, iron, is, abundant, naturally, temperatures, above, 1, 250, c, 2, 280, f, are, required, to, smelt, it, impractical, to, achieve, with, the, technology, available, commonly, until, the, end, of, the, second, millennium, bc, in, contrast, the, components, of, bronze, tin, with, a, melting, point, of, 231, 9, c, 449, 4, f, and, copper, with, a, relatively, moderate, melting, point, of, 1, 085, c, 1, 985, f, were, within, the, capabilities, of, neolithic, kilns, which, date, back, to, 6000, bc, and, were, able, to, produce, temperatures, greater, than, 900, c, 1, 650, f, in, addition, to, specially, designed, furnaces, ancient, iron, production, required, the, development, of, complex, procedures, for, the, removal, of, impurities, the, regulation, of, the, admixture, of, carbon, and, the, invention, of, hot, working, to, achieve, a, useful, balance, of, hardness, and, strength, in, steel, the, use, of, steel, has, also, been, regulated, by, the, economics, of, the, metallurgical, advancements, the, earliest, tentative, evidence, for, iron, making, is, a, small, number, of, iron, fragments, with, the, appropriate, amounts, of, carbon, admixture, found, in, the, proto, hittite, layers, at, kaman, kaleh, y, k, in, modern, day, turkey, dated, to, 2200, 2000, bc, akanuma, 2008, concludes, that, the, combination, of, carbon, dating, archaeological, context, and, archaeometallurgical, examination, indicates, that, it, is, likely, that, the, use, of, ironware, made, of, steel, had, already, begun, in, the, third, millennium, bc, in, central, anatolia, souckova, siegolov, 2001, shows, that, iron, implements, were, made, in, central, anatolia, in, very, limited, quantities, about, 1800, bc, and, were, in, general, use, by, elites, though, not, by, commoners, during, the, new, hittite, empire, 1400, 1200, bc, similarly, recent, archaeological, remains, of, iron, working, in, the, ganges, valley, in, india, have, been, dated, tentatively, to, 1800, bc, tewari, 2003, concludes, that, knowledge, of, iron, smelting, and, manufacturing, of, iron, artifacts, was, well, known, in, the, eastern, vindhyas, and, iron, had, been, in, use, in, the, central, ganga, plain, at, least, from, the, early, second, millennium, bc, by, the, middle, bronze, age, increasing, numbers, of, smelted, iron, objects, distinguishable, from, meteoric, iron, by, the, lack, of, nickel, in, the, product, appeared, in, the, middle, east, southeast, asia, and, south, asia, african, sites, are, revealing, dates, as, early, as, 2000, 1200, bc, however, some, recent, studies, date, the, inception, of, iron, metallurgy, in, africa, between, 3000, and, 2500, bc, with, evidence, existing, for, early, iron, metallurgy, in, parts, of, nigeria, cameroon, and, central, africa, from, as, early, as, around, 2, 000, bc, the, nok, culture, of, nigeria, may, have, practiced, iron, smelting, from, as, early, as, 1000, bc, while, the, nearby, djenn, djenno, culture, of, the, niger, valley, in, mali, shows, evidence, of, iron, production, from, c, 250, bc, iron, technology, across, much, of, sub, saharan, africa, has, an, african, origin, dating, to, before, 2000, bc, these, findings, confirm, the, independent, invention, of, iron, smelting, in, sub, saharan, africa, modern, archaeological, evidence, identifies, the, start, of, large, scale, global, iron, production, about, 1200, bc, marking, the, end, of, the, bronze, age, the, iron, age, in, europe, is, often, considered, as, a, part, of, the, bronze, age, collapse, in, the, ancient, near, east, anthony, snodgrass, suggests, that, a, shortage, of, tin, and, trade, disruptions, in, the, mediterranean, about, 1300, bc, forced, metalworkers, to, seek, an, alternative, to, bronze, many, bronze, implements, were, recycled, into, weapons, during, that, time, and, more, widespread, use, of, iron, resulted, in, improved, steel, making, technology, and, lower, costs, when, tin, became, readily, available, again, iron, was, cheaper, stronger, and, lighter, and, forged, iron, implements, superseded, cast, bronze, tools, permanently, in, central, and, western, europe, the, iron, age, lasted, from, c, 800, bc, to, c, 1, bc, beginning, in, pre, roman, iron, age, northern, europe, in, c, 600, bc, and, reaching, northern, scandinavian, europe, about, c, 500, bc, the, iron, age, in, the, ancient, near, east, is, considered, to, last, from, c, 1200, bc, the, bronze, age, collapse, to, c, 550, bc, or, 539, bc, roughly, the, beginning, of, historiography, with, herodotus, marking, the, end, of, the, proto, historical, period, in, china, because, writing, was, developed, first, there, is, no, recognizable, prehistoric, period, characterized, by, ironworking, and, the, bronze, age, china, transitions, almost, directly, into, the, qin, dynasty, of, imperial, china, iron, age, in, the, context, of, china, is, used, sometimes, for, the, transitional, period, of, c, 900, bc, to, 100, bc, during, which, ferrous, metallurgy, was, present, even, if, not, dominant, the, iron, age, in, the, ancient, near, east, is, believed, to, have, begun, after, the, discovery, of, iron, smelting, and, smithing, techniques, in, anatolia, the, caucasus, or, southeast, europe, during, the, late, 2nd, millennium, bc, c, 1300, bc, the, earliest, bloomery, smelting, of, iron, is, found, at, tell, hammeh, jordan, about, 930, bc, determined, from, 14, c, dating, the, early, iron, age, in, the, caucasus, area, is, divided, conventionally, into, two, periods, early, iron, i, dated, to, about, 1100, bc, and, the, early, iron, ii, phase, from, the, tenth, to, ninth, centuries, bc, many, of, the, material, culture, traditions, of, the, late, bronze, age, continued, into, the, early, iron, age, thus, there, is, a, sociocultural, continuity, during, this, transitional, period, in, iran, the, earliest, actual, iron, artifacts, were, unknown, until, the, 9th, century, bc, for, iran, the, best, studied, archaeological, site, during, this, time, period, is, teppe, hasanlu, in, the, mesopotamian, states, of, sumer, akkad, and, assyria, the, initial, use, of, iron, reaches, far, back, to, perhaps, 3000, bc, one, of, the, earliest, smelted, iron, artifacts, known, is, a, dagger, with, an, iron, blade, found, in, a, hattic, tomb, in, anatolia, dating, from, 2500, bc, the, widespread, use, of, iron, weapons, which, replaced, bronze, weapons, rapidly, disseminated, throughout, the, near, east, north, africa, southwest, asia, by, the, beginning, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, the, development, of, iron, smelting, was, once, attributed, to, the, hittites, of, anatolia, during, the, late, bronze, age, as, part, of, the, late, bronze, age, early, iron, age, the, bronze, age, collapse, saw, the, slow, comparatively, continuous, spread, of, iron, working, technology, in, the, region, it, was, long, believed, that, the, success, of, the, hittite, empire, during, the, late, bronze, age, had, been, based, on, the, advantages, entailed, by, the, monopoly, on, ironworking, at, the, time, accordingly, the, invading, sea, peoples, would, have, been, responsible, for, spreading, the, knowledge, through, that, region, the, idea, of, such, a, hittite, monopoly, has, been, examined, more, thoroughly, and, no, longer, represents, a, scholarly, consensus, while, there, are, some, iron, objects, from, bronze, age, anatolia, the, number, is, comparable, to, iron, objects, found, in, egypt, and, other, places, of, the, same, time, period, and, only, a, small, number, of, these, objects, are, weapons, dates, are, approximate, consult, particular, article, for, details, iron, metal, is, singularly, scarce, in, collections, of, egyptian, antiquities, bronze, remained, the, primary, material, there, until, the, conquest, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, in, 671, bc, the, explanation, of, this, would, seem, to, be, that, the, relics, are, in, most, cases, the, paraphernalia, of, tombs, the, funeral, vessels, and, vases, and, iron, being, considered, an, impure, metal, by, the, ancient, egyptians, it, was, never, used, in, their, manufacture, of, these, or, for, any, religious, purposes, it, was, attributed, to, seth, the, spirit, of, evil, who, according, to, egyptian, tradition, governed, the, central, deserts, of, africa, in, the, black, pyramid, of, abusir, dating, before, 2000, bc, gaston, maspero, found, some, pieces, of, iron, in, the, funeral, text, of, pepi, i, the, metal, is, mentioned, a, sword, bearing, the, name, of, pharaoh, merneptah, as, well, as, a, battle, axe, with, an, iron, blade, and, gold, decorated, bronze, shaft, were, both, found, in, the, excavation, of, ugarit, a, dagger, with, an, iron, blade, found, in, tutankhamun, s, tomb, 13th, century, bc, was, examined, recently, and, found, to, be, of, meteoric, origin, in, europe, the, iron, age, is, the, last, stage, of, prehistoric, europe, and, the, first, of, the, protohistoric, periods, which, initially, means, descriptions, of, a, particular, area, by, greek, and, roman, writers, for, much, of, europe, the, period, came, to, an, abrupt, local, end, after, conquest, by, the, romans, though, ironworking, remained, the, dominant, technology, until, recent, times, elsewhere, it, may, last, until, the, early, centuries, ad, and, either, christianization, or, a, new, conquest, during, the, migration, period, iron, working, was, introduced, to, europe, during, the, late, 11th, century, bc, probably, from, the, caucasus, and, slowly, spread, northwards, and, westwards, over, the, succeeding, 500, years, the, iron, age, did, not, start, when, iron, first, appeared, in, europe, but, it, began, to, replace, bronze, in, the, preparation, of, tools, and, weapons, it, did, not, happen, at, the, same, time, throughout, europe, local, cultural, developments, played, a, role, in, the, transition, to, the, iron, age, for, example, the, iron, age, of, prehistoric, ireland, begins, about, 500, bc, when, the, greek, iron, age, had, already, ended, and, finishes, about, 400, ad, the, widespread, use, of, the, technology, of, iron, was, implemented, in, europe, simultaneously, with, asia, the, prehistoric, iron, age, in, central, europe, is, divided, into, two, periods, based, on, the, hallstatt, culture, early, iron, age, and, la, t, ne, late, iron, age, cultures, material, cultures, of, hallstatt, and, la, t, ne, consist, of, 4, phases, a, b, c, d, the, iron, age, in, europe, is, characterized, by, an, elaboration, of, designs, of, weapons, implements, and, utensils, these, are, no, longer, cast, but, hammered, into, shape, and, decoration, is, elaborate, and, curvilinear, rather, than, simple, rectilinear, the, forms, and, character, of, the, ornamentation, of, the, northern, european, weapons, resemble, in, some, respects, roman, arms, while, in, other, respects, they, are, peculiar, and, evidently, representative, of, northern, art, cit, nia, de, briteiros, located, in, guimar, es, portugal, is, one, of, the, examples, of, archaeological, sites, of, the, iron, age, this, settlement, fortified, villages, covered, an, area, of, 3, 8, hectares, 9, 4, acres, and, served, as, a, celtiberian, stronghold, against, roman, invasions, t, dates, more, than, 2500, years, back, the, site, was, researched, by, francisco, martins, sarmento, starting, from, 1874, a, number, of, amphoras, containers, usually, for, wine, or, olive, oil, coins, fragments, of, pottery, weapons, pieces, of, jewelry, as, well, as, ruins, of, a, bath, and, its, pedra, formosa, lit, handsome, stone, revealed, here, the, iron, age, in, central, asia, began, when, iron, objects, appear, among, the, indo, european, saka, in, present, day, xinjiang, china, between, the, 10th, century, bc, and, the, 7th, century, bc, such, as, those, found, at, the, cemetery, site, of, chawuhukou, the, pazyryk, culture, is, an, iron, age, archaeological, culture, c, 6th, to, 3rd, centuries, bc, identified, by, excavated, artifacts, and, mummified, humans, found, in, the, siberian, permafrost, in, the, altay, mountains, dates, are, approximate, consult, particular, article, for, details, in, china, chinese, bronze, inscriptions, are, found, around, 1200, bc, preceding, the, development, of, iron, metallurgy, which, was, known, by, the, 9th, century, bc, the, large, seal, script, is, identified, with, a, group, of, characters, from, a, book, entitled, sh, zh, u, pi, n, c, 800, bc, therefore, in, china, prehistory, had, given, way, to, history, periodized, by, ruling, dynasties, by, the, start, of, iron, use, so, iron, age, is, not, used, typically, to, describe, a, period, of, chinese, history, iron, metallurgy, reached, the, yangtse, valley, toward, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, bc, the, few, objects, were, found, at, changsha, and, nanjing, the, mortuary, evidence, suggests, that, the, initial, use, of, iron, in, lingnan, belongs, to, the, mid, to, late, warring, states, period, from, about, 350, bc, important, non, precious, husi, style, metal, finds, include, iron, tools, found, at, the, tomb, at, guwei, cun, of, the, 4th, century, bc, the, techniques, used, in, lingnan, are, a, combination, of, bivalve, moulds, of, distinct, southern, tradition, and, the, incorporation, of, piece, mould, technology, from, the, zhongyuan, the, products, of, the, combination, of, these, two, periods, are, bells, vessels, weapons, and, ornaments, and, the, sophisticated, cast, an, iron, age, culture, of, the, tibetan, plateau, has, been, associated, tentatively, with, the, zhang, zhung, culture, described, by, early, tibetan, writings, in, japan, iron, items, such, as, tools, weapons, and, decorative, objects, are, postulated, to, have, entered, japan, during, the, late, yayoi, period, c, 300, bc, 300, ad, or, the, succeeding, kofun, period, c, 250, 538, ad, most, likely, from, the, korean, peninsula, and, china, distinguishing, characteristics, of, the, yayoi, period, include, the, appearance, of, new, pottery, styles, and, the, start, of, intensive, rice, agriculture, in, paddy, fields, yayoi, culture, flourished, in, a, geographic, area, from, southern, ky, sh, to, northern, honsh, the, kofun, and, the, subsequent, asuka, periods, are, sometimes, referred, to, collectively, as, the, yamato, period, the, word, kofun, is, japanese, for, the, type, of, burial, mounds, dating, from, that, era, iron, objects, were, introduced, to, the, korean, peninsula, through, trade, with, chiefdoms, and, state, level, societies, in, the, yellow, sea, area, during, the, 4th, century, bc, just, at, the, end, of, the, warring, states, period, but, prior, to, the, beginning, of, the, western, han, dynasty, yoon, proposes, that, iron, was, first, introduced, to, chiefdoms, located, along, north, korean, river, valleys, that, flow, into, the, yellow, sea, such, as, the, cheongcheon, and, taedong, rivers, iron, production, quickly, followed, during, the, 2nd, century, bc, and, iron, implements, came, to, be, used, by, farmers, by, the, 1st, century, in, southern, korea, the, earliest, known, cast, iron, axes, in, southern, korea, are, found, in, the, geum, river, basin, the, time, that, iron, production, begins, is, the, same, time, that, complex, chiefdoms, of, proto, historic, korea, emerged, the, complex, chiefdoms, were, the, precursors, of, early, states, such, as, silla, baekje, goguryeo, and, gaya, iron, ingots, were, an, important, mortuary, item, and, indicated, the, wealth, or, prestige, of, the, deceased, during, this, period, dates, are, approximate, consult, particular, article, for, details, the, earliest, evidence, of, iron, smelting, predates, the, emergence, of, the, iron, age, proper, by, several, centuries, iron, was, being, used, in, mundigak, to, manufacture, some, items, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, such, as, a, small, copper, bronze, bell, with, an, iron, clapper, a, copper, bronze, rod, with, two, iron, decorative, buttons, and, a, copper, bronze, mirror, handle, with, a, decorative, iron, button, artefacts, including, small, knives, and, blades, have, been, discovered, in, the, indian, state, of, telangana, which, have, been, dated, between, 2400, bc, and, 1800, bc, the, history, of, metallurgy, in, the, indian, subcontinent, began, prior, to, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, archaeological, sites, in, india, such, as, malhar, dadupur, raja, nala, ka, tila, lahuradewa, kosambi, and, jhusi, allahabad, in, present, day, uttar, pradesh, show, iron, implements, in, the, period, 1800, 1200, bc, as, the, evidence, from, the, sites, raja, nala, ka, tila, malhar, suggest, the, use, of, iron, in, c, 1800, 1700, bc, the, extensive, use, of, iron, smelting, is, from, malhar, and, its, surrounding, area, this, site, is, assumed, as, the, center, for, smelted, bloomer, iron, to, this, area, due, to, its, location, in, the, karamnasa, river, and, ganga, river, this, site, shows, agricultural, technology, as, iron, implements, sickles, nails, clamps, spearheads, etc, by, at, least, c, 1500, bc, archaeological, excavations, in, hyderabad, show, an, iron, age, burial, site, the, beginning, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, saw, extensive, developments, in, iron, metallurgy, in, india, technological, advancement, and, mastery, of, iron, metallurgy, were, achieved, during, this, period, of, peaceful, settlements, one, ironworking, centre, in, east, india, has, been, dated, to, the, first, millennium, bc, in, southern, india, present, day, mysore, iron, appeared, as, early, as, 12th, to, 11th, centuries, bc, these, developments, were, too, early, for, any, significant, close, contact, with, the, northwest, of, the, country, the, indian, upanishads, mention, metallurgy, and, the, indian, mauryan, period, saw, advances, in, metallurgy, as, early, as, 300, bc, certainly, by, 200, ad, high, quality, steel, was, produced, in, southern, india, by, what, would, later, be, called, the, crucible, technique, in, this, system, high, purity, wrought, iron, charcoal, and, glass, were, mixed, in, a, crucible, and, heated, until, the, iron, melted, and, absorbed, the, carbon, the, protohistoric, early, iron, age, in, sri, lanka, lasted, from, 1000, bc, to, 600, bc, radiocarbon, evidence, has, been, collected, from, anuradhapura, and, aligala, shelter, in, sigiriya, the, anuradhapura, settlement, is, recorded, to, extend, 10, ha, 25, acres, by, 800, bc, and, grew, to, 50, ha, 120, acres, by, 700, 600, bc, to, become, a, town, the, skeletal, remains, of, an, early, iron, age, chief, were, excavated, in, anaikoddai, jaffna, the, name, ko, veta, is, engraved, in, brahmi, script, on, a, seal, buried, with, the, skeleton, and, is, assigned, by, the, excavators, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, ko, meaning, king, in, tamil, is, comparable, to, such, names, as, ko, atan, and, ko, putivira, occurring, in, contemporary, brahmi, inscriptions, in, south, india, it, is, also, speculated, that, early, iron, age, sites, may, exist, in, kandarodai, matota, pilapitiya, and, tissamaharama, the, earliest, undisputed, deciphered, epigraphy, found, in, the, indian, subcontinent, are, the, edicts, of, ashoka, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, in, the, brahmi, script, several, inscriptions, were, thought, to, be, pre, ashokan, by, earlier, scholars, these, include, the, piprahwa, relic, casket, inscription, the,
