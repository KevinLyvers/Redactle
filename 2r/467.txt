successor, states, and, the, german, soviet, war, in, modern, germany, and, ukraine, was, a, theatre, of, world, war, ii, fought, between, the, european, axis, powers, and, allies, including, the, soviet, union, ussr, and, poland, it, encompassed, central, europe, eastern, europe, northeast, europe, baltics, and, southeast, europe, balkans, and, lasted, from, 22, june, 1941, to, 9, may, 1945, of, the, estimated, 70, 85, million, deaths, attributed, to, world, war, ii, around, 30, million, occurred, on, the, eastern, front, including, 9, million, children, the, eastern, front, was, decisive, in, determining, the, outcome, in, the, european, theatre, of, operations, in, world, war, ii, eventually, serving, as, the, main, reason, for, the, defeat, of, nazi, germany, and, the, axis, nations, it, is, noted, by, historian, geoffrey, roberts, that, more, than, 80, percent, of, all, combat, during, the, second, world, war, took, place, on, the, eastern, front, the, axis, forces, led, by, nazi, germany, began, their, advance, into, the, soviet, union, under, the, codename, operation, barbarossa, on, 22, june, 1941, the, opening, date, of, the, eastern, front, initially, soviet, forces, were, unable, to, halt, the, axis, forces, which, came, close, to, moscow, despite, their, many, attempts, the, axis, failed, to, capture, moscow, and, soon, focused, on, the, oil, fields, in, the, caucasus, german, forces, invaded, the, caucasus, under, the, fall, blau, case, blue, plan, on, 28, june, 1942, the, soviets, successfully, halted, further, axis, advance, at, stalingrad, the, bloodiest, battle, in, the, war, costing, the, axis, powers, their, morale, and, becoming, the, turning, point, of, the, front, seeing, the, axis, setback, from, stalingrad, the, soviet, union, routed, its, forces, and, regained, territories, at, its, expense, the, axis, defeat, at, kursk, terminated, the, german, offensive, strength, and, cleared, the, way, for, soviet, offensives, its, setbacks, caused, many, countries, friendly, with, germany, to, defect, and, join, the, allies, such, as, romania, and, bulgaria, the, eastern, front, concluded, with, the, capture, of, berlin, followed, by, the, signing, of, the, german, instrument, of, surrender, on, 8, may, a, day, that, marked, the, end, of, the, eastern, front, and, the, war, in, europe, the, battles, on, the, eastern, front, of, world, war, ii, constituted, the, largest, military, confrontation, in, history, in, pursuit, of, its, lebensraum, settler, colonial, agenda, nazi, germany, waged, a, war, of, annihilation, vernichtungskrieg, throughout, eastern, europe, nazi, military, operations, were, characterised, by, vicious, brutality, scorched, earth, tactics, wanton, destruction, mass, deportations, forced, starvations, wholesale, terrorism, and, massacres, these, also, included, the, genocidal, campaigns, of, generalplan, ost, and, hunger, plan, which, aimed, to, the, extermination, and, ethnic, cleansing, of, more, than, a, hundred, million, eastern, european, natives, german, historian, ernst, nolte, called, the, eastern, front, the, most, atrocious, war, of, conquest, enslavement, and, annihilation, known, to, modern, history, while, british, historian, robin, cross, expressed, that, in, the, second, world, war, no, theatre, was, more, gruelling, and, destructive, than, the, eastern, front, and, nowhere, was, the, fighting, more, bitter, the, two, principal, belligerent, powers, in, the, eastern, front, were, germany, and, the, soviet, union, along, with, their, respective, allies, though, they, never, sent, ground, troops, to, the, eastern, front, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, both, provided, substantial, material, aid, to, the, soviet, union, in, the, form, of, the, lend, lease, program, along, with, naval, and, air, support, the, joint, german, finnish, operations, across, the, northernmost, finnish, soviet, border, and, in, the, murmansk, region, are, considered, part, of, the, eastern, front, in, addition, the, soviet, finnish, continuation, war, is, generally, also, considered, the, northern, flank, of, the, eastern, front, germany, and, the, soviet, union, remained, unsatisfied, with, the, outcome, of, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, soviet, russia, had, lost, substantial, territory, in, eastern, europe, as, a, result, of, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, march, 1918, where, the, bolsheviks, in, petrograd, conceded, to, german, demands, and, ceded, control, of, poland, lithuania, estonia, latvia, finland, and, other, areas, to, the, central, powers, subsequently, when, germany, in, its, turn, surrendered, to, the, allies, november, 1918, and, these, territories, became, independent, states, under, the, terms, of, the, paris, peace, conference, of, 1919, at, versailles, soviet, russia, was, in, the, midst, of, a, civil, war, and, the, allies, did, not, recognise, the, bolshevik, government, so, no, soviet, russian, representation, attended, adolf, hitler, had, declared, his, intention, to, invade, the, soviet, union, on, 11, august, 1939, to, carl, jacob, burckhardt, league, of, nations, commissioner, by, saying, everything, i, undertake, is, directed, against, the, russians, if, the, west, is, too, stupid, and, blind, to, grasp, this, then, i, shall, be, compelled, to, come, to, an, agreement, with, the, russians, beat, the, west, and, then, after, their, defeat, turn, against, the, soviet, union, with, all, my, forces, i, need, the, ukraine, so, that, they, can, t, starve, us, out, as, happened, in, the, last, war, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, signed, in, august, 1939, was, a, non, aggression, agreement, between, germany, and, the, soviet, union, it, contained, a, secret, protocol, aiming, to, return, central, europe, to, the, pre, world, war, i, status, quo, by, dividing, it, between, germany, and, the, soviet, union, finland, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, would, return, to, the, soviet, control, while, poland, and, romania, would, be, divided, the, eastern, front, was, also, made, possible, by, the, german, soviet, border, and, commercial, agreement, in, which, the, soviet, union, gave, germany, the, resources, necessary, to, launch, military, operations, in, eastern, europe, on, 1, september, 1939, germany, invaded, poland, starting, world, war, ii, on, 17, september, the, soviet, union, invaded, eastern, poland, and, as, a, result, poland, was, partitioned, among, germany, the, soviet, union, and, lithuania, soon, after, that, the, soviet, union, demanded, significant, territorial, concessions, from, finland, and, after, finland, rejected, soviet, demands, the, soviet, union, attacked, finland, on, 30, november, 1939, in, what, became, known, as, the, winter, war, a, bitter, conflict, that, resulted, in, a, peace, treaty, on, 13, march, 1940, with, finland, maintaining, its, independence, but, losing, its, eastern, parts, in, karelia, in, june, 1940, the, soviet, union, occupied, and, illegally, annexed, the, three, baltic, states, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, ostensibly, provided, security, to, the, soviets, in, the, occupation, both, of, the, baltics, and, of, the, north, and, northeastern, regions, of, romania, northern, bukovina, and, bessarabia, june, july, 1940, although, hitler, in, announcing, the, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, cited, the, soviet, annexations, of, baltic, and, romanian, territory, as, having, violated, germany, s, understanding, of, the, pact, moscow, partitioned, the, annexed, romanian, territory, between, the, ukrainian, and, moldavian, soviet, socialist, republics, hitler, had, argued, in, his, autobiography, mein, kampf, 1925, for, the, necessity, of, lebensraum, living, space, acquiring, new, territory, for, germans, in, eastern, europe, in, particular, russia, he, envisaged, settling, germans, there, as, according, to, nazi, ideology, the, germanic, people, constituted, the, master, race, while, exterminating, or, deporting, most, of, the, existing, inhabitants, to, siberia, and, using, the, remainder, as, slave, labour, hitler, as, early, as, 1917, had, referred, to, the, russians, as, inferior, believing, that, the, bolshevik, revolution, had, put, the, jews, in, power, over, the, mass, of, slavs, who, were, in, hitler, s, opinion, incapable, of, ruling, themselves, and, had, thus, ended, up, being, ruled, by, jewish, masters, the, nazi, leadership, including, heinrich, himmler, saw, the, war, against, the, soviet, union, as, a, struggle, between, the, ideologies, of, nazism, and, jewish, bolshevism, ensuring, territorial, expansion, for, the, germanic, bermenschen, superhumans, who, according, to, nazi, ideology, were, the, aryan, herrenvolk, master, race, at, the, expense, of, the, slavic, untermenschen, subhumans, wehrmacht, officers, told, their, troops, to, target, people, who, were, described, as, jewish, bolshevik, subhumans, the, mongol, hordes, the, asiatic, flood, and, the, red, beast, the, vast, majority, of, german, soldiers, viewed, the, war, in, nazi, terms, seeing, the, soviet, enemy, as, sub, human, hitler, referred, to, the, war, in, radical, terms, calling, it, a, war, of, annihilation, german, vernichtungskrieg, which, was, both, an, ideological, and, racial, war, the, nazi, vision, for, the, future, of, eastern, europe, was, codified, most, clearly, in, the, generalplan, ost, the, populations, of, occupied, central, europe, and, the, soviet, union, were, to, be, partially, deported, to, west, siberia, enslaved, and, eventually, exterminated, the, conquered, territories, were, to, be, colonised, by, german, or, germanized, settlers, in, addition, the, nazis, also, sought, to, rid, themselves, of, the, large, jewish, population, of, central, and, eastern, europe, as, part, of, their, program, aiming, to, exterminate, all, european, jews, psychologically, the, german, surge, to, the, east, in, 1941, marked, a, high, point, in, some, germans, feeling, of, ostrausch, an, intoxication, with, the, idea, of, colonising, the, east, after, germany, s, initial, success, at, the, battle, of, kiev, in, 1941, hitler, saw, the, soviet, union, as, militarily, weak, and, ripe, for, immediate, conquest, in, a, speech, at, the, berlin, sportpalast, on, 3, october, he, announced, we, have, only, to, kick, in, the, door, and, the, whole, rotten, structure, will, come, crashing, down, thus, the, german, authorities, expected, another, short, blitzkrieg, and, made, no, serious, preparations, for, prolonged, warfare, however, following, the, decisive, soviet, victory, at, the, battle, of, stalingrad, in, 1943, and, the, resulting, dire, german, military, situation, nazi, propaganda, began, to, portray, the, war, as, a, german, defence, of, western, civilisation, against, destruction, by, the, vast, bolshevik, hordes, that, were, pouring, into, europe, throughout, the, 1930s, the, soviet, union, underwent, massive, industrialisation, and, economic, growth, under, the, leadership, of, joseph, stalin, stalin, s, central, tenet, socialism, in, one, country, manifested, itself, as, a, series, of, nationwide, centralised, five, year, plans, from, 1929, onwards, this, represented, an, ideological, shift, in, soviet, policy, away, from, its, commitment, to, the, international, communist, revolution, and, eventually, leading, to, the, dissolution, of, the, comintern, third, international, organisation, in, 1943, the, soviet, union, started, a, process, of, militarisation, with, the, first, five, year, plan, that, officially, began, in, 1928, although, it, was, only, towards, the, end, of, the, second, five, year, plan, in, the, mid, 1930s, that, military, power, became, the, primary, focus, of, soviet, industrialisation, in, february, 1936, the, spanish, general, election, brought, many, communist, leaders, into, the, popular, front, government, in, the, second, spanish, republic, but, in, a, matter, of, months, a, right, wing, military, coup, initiated, the, spanish, civil, war, of, 1936, 1939, this, conflict, soon, took, on, the, characteristics, of, a, proxy, war, involving, the, soviet, union, and, left, wing, volunteers, from, different, countries, on, the, side, of, the, predominantly, socialist, and, communist, led, second, spanish, republic, while, nazi, germany, fascist, italy, and, portugal, s, estado, novo, took, the, side, of, spanish, nationalists, the, military, rebel, group, led, by, general, francisco, franco, it, served, as, a, useful, testing, ground, for, both, the, wehrmacht, and, the, red, army, to, experiment, with, equipment, and, tactics, that, they, would, later, employ, on, a, wider, scale, in, the, second, world, war, nazi, germany, which, was, an, anti, communist, r, gime, formalised, its, ideological, position, on, 25, november, 1936, by, signing, the, anti, comintern, pact, with, imperial, japan, fascist, italy, joined, the, pact, a, year, later, the, soviet, union, negotiated, treaties, of, mutual, assistance, with, france, and, with, czechoslovakia, with, the, aim, of, containing, germany, s, expansion, the, german, anschluss, of, austria, in, 1938, and, the, dismemberment, of, czechoslovakia, 1938, 1939, demonstrated, the, impossibility, of, establishing, a, collective, security, system, in, europe, a, policy, advocated, by, the, soviet, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, under, maxim, litvinov, this, as, well, as, the, reluctance, of, the, british, and, french, governments, to, sign, a, full, scale, anti, german, political, and, military, alliance, with, the, ussr, led, to, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, between, the, soviet, union, and, germany, in, late, august, 1939, the, separate, tripartite, pact, between, what, became, the, three, prime, axis, powers, would, not, be, signed, until, some, four, years, after, the, anti, comintern, pact, the, war, was, fought, between, germany, its, allies, and, finland, against, the, soviet, union, and, its, allies, the, conflict, began, on, 22, june, 1941, with, the, operation, barbarossa, offensive, when, axis, forces, crossed, the, borders, described, in, the, german, soviet, nonaggression, pact, thereby, invading, the, soviet, union, the, war, ended, on, 9, may, 1945, when, germany, s, armed, forces, surrendered, unconditionally, following, the, battle, of, berlin, also, known, as, the, berlin, offensive, a, strategic, operation, executed, by, the, red, army, the, states, that, provided, forces, and, other, resources, for, the, german, war, effort, included, the, axis, powers, primarily, romania, hungary, italy, pro, nazi, slovakia, and, croatia, anti, soviet, finland, which, had, fought, the, winter, war, against, the, soviet, union, also, joined, the, offensive, the, wehrmacht, forces, were, also, assisted, by, anti, communist, partisans, in, places, like, western, ukraine, and, the, baltic, states, among, the, most, prominent, volunteer, army, formations, was, the, spanish, blue, division, sent, by, spanish, dictator, francisco, franco, to, keep, his, ties, to, the, axis, intact, the, soviet, union, offered, support, to, the, anti, axis, partisans, in, many, wehrmacht, occupied, countries, in, central, europe, notably, those, in, slovakia, and, poland, in, addition, the, polish, armed, forces, in, the, east, particularly, the, first, and, second, polish, armies, were, armed, and, trained, and, would, eventually, fight, alongside, the, red, army, the, free, french, forces, also, contributed, to, the, red, army, by, the, formation, of, the, gc3, groupe, de, chasse, 3, or, 3rd, fighter, group, unit, to, fulfil, the, commitment, of, charles, de, gaulle, leader, of, the, free, french, who, thought, that, it, was, important, for, french, servicemen, to, serve, on, all, fronts, the, above, figures, includes, all, personnel, in, the, german, army, i, e, active, duty, heer, waffen, ss, luftwaffe, ground, forces, personnel, of, the, naval, coastal, artillery, and, security, units, in, the, spring, of, 1940, germany, had, mobilised, 5, 500, 000, men, by, the, time, of, the, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, the, wehrmacht, consisted, of, c, 3, 800, 000, men, of, the, heer, 1, 680, 000, of, the, luftwaffe, 404, 000, of, the, kriegsmarine, 150, 000, of, the, waffen, ss, and, 1, 200, 000, of, the, replacement, army, contained, 450, 400, active, reservists, 550, 000, new, recruits, and, 204, 000, in, administrative, services, vigiles, and, or, in, convalescence, the, wehrmacht, had, a, total, strength, of, 7, 234, 000, men, by, 1941, for, operation, barbarossa, germany, mobilised, 3, 300, 000, troops, of, the, heer, 150, 000, of, the, waffen, ss, and, approximately, 250, 000, personnel, of, the, luftwaffe, were, actively, earmarked, by, july, 1943, the, wehrmacht, numbered, 6, 815, 000, troops, of, these, 3, 900, 000, were, deployed, in, eastern, europe, 180, 000, in, finland, 315, 000, in, norway, 110, 000, in, denmark, 1, 370, 000, in, western, europe, 330, 000, in, italy, and, 610, 000, in, the, balkans, according, to, a, presentation, by, alfred, jodl, the, wehrmacht, was, up, to, 7, 849, 000, personnel, in, april, 1944, 3, 878, 000, were, deployed, in, eastern, europe, 311, 000, in, norway, denmark, 1, 873, 000, in, western, europe, 961, 000, in, italy, and, 826, 000, in, the, balkans, about, 15, 20, of, total, german, strength, were, foreign, troops, from, allied, countries, or, conquered, territories, the, german, high, water, mark, was, just, before, the, battle, of, kursk, in, early, july, 1943, 3, 403, 000, german, troops, and, 650, 000, finnish, hungarian, romanian, and, other, countries, troops, for, nearly, two, years, the, border, was, quiet, while, germany, conquered, denmark, norway, france, the, low, countries, and, the, balkans, hitler, had, always, intended, to, renege, on, his, pact, with, the, soviet, union, eventually, making, the, decision, to, invade, in, the, spring, of, 1941, some, historians, say, stalin, was, fearful, of, war, with, germany, or, just, did, not, expect, germany, to, start, a, two, front, war, and, was, reluctant, to, do, anything, to, provoke, hitler, another, viewpoint, is, that, stalin, expected, war, in, 1942, the, time, when, all, his, preparations, would, be, complete, and, stubbornly, refused, to, believe, it, would, come, early, british, historians, alan, s, milward, and, m, medlicott, show, that, nazi, germany, unlike, imperial, germany, was, prepared, for, only, a, short, term, war, blitzkrieg, according, to, edward, ericson, although, germany, s, own, resources, were, sufficient, for, the, victories, in, the, west, in, 1940, massive, soviet, shipments, obtained, during, a, short, period, of, nazi, soviet, economic, collaboration, were, critical, for, germany, to, launch, operation, barbarossa, germany, had, been, assembling, very, large, numbers, of, troops, in, eastern, poland, and, making, repeated, reconnaissance, flights, over, the, border, the, soviet, union, responded, by, assembling, its, divisions, on, its, western, border, although, the, soviet, mobilisation, was, slower, than, germany, s, due, to, the, country, s, less, dense, road, network, as, in, the, sino, soviet, conflict, on, the, chinese, eastern, railway, or, soviet, japanese, border, conflicts, soviet, troops, on, the, western, border, received, a, directive, signed, by, marshal, semyon, timoshenko, and, general, of, the, army, georgy, zhukov, that, ordered, as, demanded, by, stalin, do, not, answer, to, any, provocations, and, do, not, undertake, any, offensive, actions, without, specific, orders, which, meant, that, soviet, troops, could, open, fire, only, on, their, soil, and, forbade, counter, attack, on, german, soil, the, german, invasion, therefore, caught, the, soviet, military, and, civilian, leadership, largely, by, surprise, the, extent, of, warnings, received, by, stalin, about, a, german, invasion, is, controversial, and, the, claim, that, there, was, a, warning, that, germany, will, attack, on, 22, june, without, declaration, of, war, has, been, dismissed, as, a, popular, myth, however, some, sources, quoted, in, the, articles, on, soviet, spies, richard, sorge, and, willi, lehmann, say, they, had, sent, warnings, of, an, attack, on, 20, or, 22, june, which, were, treated, as, disinformation, the, lucy, spy, ring, in, switzerland, also, sent, warnings, possibly, deriving, from, ultra, codebreaking, in, britain, sweden, had, access, to, internal, german, communications, through, breaking, the, crypto, used, in, the, siemens, and, halske, t52, crypto, machine, also, known, as, the, geheimschreiber, and, informed, stalin, about, the, forthcoming, invasion, well, ahead, of, june, 22, but, did, not, reveal, its, sources, soviet, intelligence, was, fooled, by, german, disinformation, so, sent, false, alarms, to, moscow, about, a, german, invasion, in, april, may, and, the, beginning, of, june, soviet, intelligence, reported, that, germany, would, rather, invade, the, ussr, after, the, fall, of, the, british, empire, or, after, an, unacceptable, ultimatum, demanding, german, occupation, of, ukraine, during, the, german, invasion, of, britain, a, strategic, air, offensive, by, the, united, states, army, air, force, and, royal, air, force, played, a, significant, part, in, damaging, german, industry, and, tying, up, german, air, force, and, air, defence, resources, with, some, bombings, such, as, the, bombing, of, the, eastern, german, city, of, dresden, being, done, to, facilitate, specific, soviet, operational, goals, in, addition, to, germany, hundreds, of, thousands, of, tons, of, bombs, were, dropped, on, their, eastern, allies, of, romania, and, hungary, primarily, in, an, attempt, to, cripple, romanian, oil, production, british, and, commonwealth, forces, also, contributed, directly, to, the, fighting, on, the, eastern, front, through, their, service, in, the, arctic, convoys, and, training, red, air, force, pilots, as, well, as, in, the, provision, of, early, material, and, intelligence, support, among, other, goods, lend, lease, supplied, 8, 9, lend, lease, aid, of, military, hardware, components, and, goods, to, the, soviet, union, constituted, to, 20, percent, of, the, assistance, 122, the, rest, were, foodstuff, nonferrous, metals, e, g, copper, magnesium, nickel, zinc, lead, tin, aluminium, chemical, substances, petroleum, high, octane, aviation, gasoline, and, factory, machinery, the, aid, of, production, line, equipment, and, machinery, were, crucial, and, helped, to, maintain, adequate, levels, of, soviet, armament, production, during, the, entire, war, 122, in, addition, the, ussr, received, wartime, innovations, including, penicillin, radar, rocket, precision, bombing, technology, the, long, range, navigation, system, loran, and, many, other, innovations, 123, of, the, 800, 000, tons, of, nonferrous, metals, shipped, 124, about, 350, 000, tons, were, aluminium, 135, the, shipment, of, aluminium, not, only, represented, double, the, amount, of, metal, that, germany, possessed, but, also, composed, the, bulk, of, aluminium, that, was, used, in, manufacture, of, soviet, aircraft, that, had, fallen, in, critically, short, supply, 135, soviet, statistics, show, that, without, these, shipments, of, aluminium, aircraft, production, would, have, been, less, than, one, half, or, about, 45, 000, less, of, the, total, 137, 000, produced, aircraft, 135, stalin, noted, in, 1944, that, two, thirds, of, soviet, heavy, industry, had, been, built, with, the, help, of, the, united, states, and, the, remaining, one, third, with, the, help, from, other, western, nations, such, as, great, britain, and, canada, 129, the, massive, transfer, of, equipment, and, skilled, personnel, from, occupied, territories, helped, further, to, boost, the, economic, base, 129, without, lend, lease, aid, soviet, union, s, diminished, post, invasion, economic, base, would, not, have, produced, adequate, supplies, of, weaponry, other, than, focus, on, machine, tool, foodstuff, and, consumer, goods, 129, in, the, last, year, of, war, lend, lease, data, show, that, about, 5, 1, million, tons, of, foodstuff, left, the, united, states, for, the, soviet, union, 123, it, is, estimated, that, all, the, food, supplies, sent, to, russia, could, feed, a, 12, 000, 000, man, strong, army, a, half, pound, of, concentrated, food, per, day, for, the, entire, duration, of, the, war, 122, 3, the, total, lend,

the, ground, for, a, month, the, offensive, conducted, on, three, axes, was, completely, unstoppable, as, the, panzer, forces, encircled, hundreds, of, thousands, of, soviet, troops, in, huge, pockets, that, were, then, reduced, by, slower, moving, infantry, armies, while, the, panzers, continued, the, offensive, luftwaffe, also, dropped, hundreds, of, russian, speaking, parachutists,

with, army, group, south, which, was, advancing, into, ukraine, army, group, centre, s, infantry, divisions, were, left, relatively, unsupported, by, armour, to, continue, their, slow, advance, to, moscow, this, decision, caused, a, severe, leadership, crisis, the, german, field, commanders, argued, for, an, immediate, offensive, towards, moscow, but, hitler, over, ruled, them, citing, the, importance, of, ukrainian, agricultural, mining, and, industrial, resources, as, well, as, the, massing, of, soviet, reserves, in, the, gomel, area, between, army, group, centre, s, southern, flank, and, the, bogged, down, army, group, south, s, northern, flank, this, decision, hitler, s, summer, pause, is, believed, to, have, had, a, severe, impact, on, the, outcome, of, the, battle, of, moscow,

and, wait, while, their, opponent, gathered, more, strength, however, by, 6, december, it, became, clear, that, the, wehrmacht, did, not, have, the, strength, to, capture, moscow, and, the, attack,

in, the, third, week, of, march, when, the, spring, thaw, intervened, this, left, a, glaring, soviet, bulge, in, the, front, centered, on, kursk, after, the, failure, of, the, attempt, to, capture, stalingrad, hitler, had, delegated, planning, authority, for, the, upcoming, campaign, season, to, the, german, army, high, command, and, reinstated, heinz, guderian, to, a, prominent, role, this, time, as, inspector, of, panzer, troops, debate, among, the, general, staff, was, polarised, with, even, hitler, nervous, about, any, attempt, to, pinch, off, the, kursk, salient, he, knew, that, in, the, intervening, six, months, the, soviet, position, at, kursk, had, been, reinforced, heavily, with, anti, tank, guns, tank, traps, landmines, barbed, wire, trenches, pillboxes, artillery, and, mortars, however, if, one, last, great, blitzkrieg, offensive, could, be, mounted, then, attention, could, then, be, turned, to, the, allied, threat, to, the, western, front, certainly, the, peace, negotiations, in, april, had, gone, nowhere, the, advance, would, be, executed, from, the, orel, salient, to, the, north, of, kursk, and, from, belgorod, to, the, south, both, wings, would, converge, on, the, area, east, of, kursk, and, by, that, means, restore, the, lines, of, army, group, south, to, the, exact, points, that, it, held, over, the, winter, of, 1941, 1942, in, the, north, the, entire, german, 9th, army, had, been, redeployed, from, the, rzhev, salient, into, the, orel, salient, and, was, to, advance, from, maloarkhangelsk, to, kursk, but, its, forces, could, not, even, get, past, the, first, objective, at, olkhovatka, just, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, into, the, advance, the, 9th, army, blunted, its, spearhead, against, the, soviet, minefields, frustratingly, so, considering, that, the, high, ground, there, was, the, only, natural, barrier, between, them, and, flat, tank, country, all, the, way, to, kursk, the, direction, of, advance, was, then, switched, to, ponyri, to, the, west, of, olkhovatka, but, the, 9th, army, could, not, break, through, here, either, and, went, over, to, the, defensive, the, red, army, then, launched, a, counter, offensive, operation, kutuzov, on, 12, july, the, red, army, battled, through, the, demarcation, line, between, the, 211th, and, 293rd, divisions, on, the, zhizdra, river, and, steamed, towards, karachev, right, behind, them, and, behind, orel, the, southern, offensive, spearheaded, by, 4th, panzer, army, led, by, gen, col, hoth, with, three, tank, corps, made, more, headway, advancing, on, either, side, of, the, upper, donets, on, a, narrow, corridor, the, ii, ss, panzer, corps, and, the, gro, deutschland, panzergrenadier, divisions, battled, their, way, through, minefields, and, over, comparatively, high, ground, towards, oboyan, stiff, resistance, caused, a, change, of, direction, from, east, to, west, of, the, front, but, the, tanks, got, 25, km, 16, mi, before, encountering, the, reserves, of, the, soviet, 5th, guards, tank, army, outside, prokhorovka, battle, was, joined, on, 12, july, with, about, one, thousand, tanks, being, engaged, after, the, war, the, battle, near, prochorovka, was, idealised, by, soviet, historians, as, the, largest, tank, battle, of, all, time, the, meeting, engagement, at, prochorovka, was, a, soviet, defensive, success, albeit, at, heavy, cost, the, soviet, 5th, guards, tank, army, with, about, 800, light, and, medium, tanks, attacked, elements, of, the, ii, ss, panzer, corps, tank, losses, on, both, sides, have, been, the, source, of, controversy, ever, since, although, the, 5th, guards, tank, army, did, not, attain, its, objectives, the, german, advance, had, been, halted, at, the, end, of, the, day, both, sides, had, fought, each, other, to, a, standstill, but, regardless, of, the, german, failure, in, the, north, manstein, proposed, he, continue, the, attack, with, the, 4th, panzer, army, the, red, army, started, the, strong, offensive, operation, in, the, northern, orel, salient, and, achieved, a, breakthrough, on, the, flank, of, the, german, 9th, army, also, worried, by, the, allies, landing, in, sicily, on, 10, july, hitler, made, the, decision, to, halt, the, offensive, even, as, the, german, 9th, army, was, rapidly, giving, ground, in, the, north, the, germans, final, strategic, offensive, in, the, soviet, union, ended, with, their, defence, against, a, major, soviet, counteroffensive, that, lasted, into, august, the, kursk, offensive, was, the, last, on, the, scale, of, 1940, and, 1941, that, the, wehrmacht, was, able, to, launch, subsequent, offensives, would, represent, only, a, shadow, of, previous, german, offensive, might, the, soviet, multi, stage, summer, offensive, started, with, the, advance, into, the, orel, salient, the, diversion, of, the, well, equipped, gro, deutschland, division, from, belgorod, to, karachev, could, not, counteract, it, and, the, wehrmacht, began, a, withdrawal, from, orel, retaken, by, the, red, army, on, 5, august, 1943, falling, back, to, the, hagen, line, in, front, of, bryansk, to, the, south, the, red, army, broke, through, army, group, south, s, belgorod, positions, and, headed, for, kharkov, once, again, although, intense, battles, of, movement, throughout, late, july, and, into, august, 1943, saw, the, tigers, blunting, soviet, tank, attacks, on, one, axis, they, were, soon, outflanked, on, another, line, to, the, west, as, the, soviet, forces, advanced, down, the, psel, and, kharkov, was, abandoned, for, the, final, time, on, 22, august, the, german, forces, on, the, mius, now, comprising, the, 1st, panzer, army, and, a, reconstituted, 6th, army, were, by, august, too, weak, to, repulse, a, soviet, attack, on, their, own, front, and, when, the, red, army, hit, them, they, retreated, all, the, way, through, the, donbas, industrial, region, to, the, dnieper, losing, half, the, farmland, that, germany, had, invaded, the, soviet, union, to, exploit, at, this, time, hitler, agreed, to, a, general, withdrawal, to, the, dnieper, line, along, which, was, meant, to, be, the, ostwall, a, line, of, defence, similar, to, the, westwall, siegfried, line, of, fortifications, along, the, german, frontier, in, the, west, the, main, problem, for, the, wehrmacht, was, that, these, defences, had, not, yet, been, built, by, the, time, army, group, south, had, evacuated, eastern, ukraine, and, begun, withdrawing, across, the, dnieper, during, september, the, soviet, forces, were, hard, behind, them, tenaciously, small, units, paddled, their, way, across, the, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, wide, river, and, established, bridgeheads, a, second, attempt, by, the, red, army, to, gain, land, using, parachutists, mounted, at, kaniv, on, 24, september, proved, as, disappointing, as, at, dorogobuzh, eighteen, months, previously, the, paratroopers, were, soon, repelled, but, not, until, still, more, red, army, troops, had, used, the, cover, they, provided, to, get, themselves, over, the, dnieper, and, securely, dug, in, as, september, ended, and, october, started, the, germans, found, the, dnieper, line, impossible, to, hold, as, the, soviet, bridgeheads, grew, important, dnieper, towns, started, to, fall, with, zaporozhye, the, first, to, go, followed, by, dnepropetrovsk, finally, early, in, november, the, red, army, broke, out, of, its, bridgeheads, on, either, side, of, kiev, and, captured, the, ukrainian, capital, at, that, time, the, third, largest, city, in, the, soviet, union, 130, kilometres, 80, mi, west, of, kiev, the, 4th, panzer, army, still, convinced, that, the, red, army, was, a, spent, force, was, able, to, mount, a, successful, riposte, at, zhytomyr, during, the, middle, of, november, weakening, the, soviet, bridgehead, by, a, daring, outflanking, strike, mounted, by, the, ss, panzer, corps, along, the, river, teterev, this, battle, also, enabled, army, group, south, to, recapture, korosten, and, gain, some, time, to, rest, however, on, christmas, eve, the, retreat, began, anew, when, the, first, ukrainian, front, renamed, from, the, voronezh, front, struck, them, in, the, same, place, the, soviet, advance, continued, along, the, railway, line, until, the, 1939, polish, soviet, border, was, reached, on, 3, january, 1944, to, the, south, the, second, ukrainian, front, ex, steppe, front, had, crossed, the, dnieper, at, kremenchug, and, continued, westwards, in, the, second, week, of, january, 1944, they, swung, north, meeting, vatutin, s, tank, forces, which, had, swung, south, from, their, penetration, into, poland, and, surrounding, ten, german, divisions, at, korsun, shevchenkovsky, west, of, cherkassy, hitler, s, insistence, on, holding, the, dnieper, line, even, when, facing, the, prospect, of, catastrophic, defeat, was, compounded, by, his, conviction, that, the, cherkassy, pocket, could, break, out, and, even, advance, to, kiev, but, manstein, was, more, concerned, about, being, able, to, advance, to, the, edge, of, the, pocket, and, then, implore, the, surrounded, forces, to, break, out, by, 16, february, the, first, stage, was, complete, with, panzers, separated, from, the, contracting, cherkassy, pocket, only, by, the, swollen, gniloy, tikich, river, under, shellfire, and, pursued, by, soviet, tanks, the, surrounded, german, troops, among, whom, were, the, 5th, ss, panzer, division, wiking, fought, their, way, across, the, river, to, safety, although, at, the, cost, of, half, their, number, and, all, their, equipment, they, assumed, the, red, army, would, not, attack, again, with, the, spring, approaching, but, on, 3, march, the, soviet, ukrainian, front, went, over, to, the, offensive, having, already, isolated, the, crimea, by, severing,

the, 12th, on, 13, may, 1945, all, soviet, offensives, ceased, and, the, fighting, on, the, eastern, front, of, world, war, ii, came, to, an, end, after, the, german, defeat, stalin, promised, his, allies, truman, and, churchill, that, he, would, attack, the, japanese, within, 90, days, of, the, german, surrender, the, soviet, invasion, of, manchuria, began, on, 8, august, 1945, with, an, assault, on, the, japanese, puppet, states, of, manchukuo, and, neighbouring, mengjiang, the, greater, offensive, would, eventually, include, northern, korea, southern, sakhalin, and, the, kuril, islands, apart, from, the, battles, of, khalkhin, gol, it, marked, the, only, military, action, of, the, soviet, union, against, imperial, japan, at, the, yalta, conference, it, had, agreed, to, allied, pleas, to, terminate, the, neutrality, pact, with, japan, and, enter, the, second, world, war, s, pacific, theatre, within, three, months, after, the, end, of, the, war, in, europe, while, not, a, part, of, the, eastern, front, operations, it, is, included, here, because, the, commanders, and, much, of, the, forces, used, by, the, red, army, came, from, the, european, theatre, of, operations, and, benefited, from, the, experience, gained, there, the, eastern, front, was, the, largest, and, bloodiest, theatre, of, world, war, ii, it, is, generally, accepted, as, being, the, deadliest, conflict, in, human, history, with, over, 30, million, killed, as, a, result, the, german, armed, forces, suffered, 80, of, its, military, deaths, in, the, eastern, front, it, involved, more, land, combat, than, all, other, world, war, ii, theatres, combined, the, largest, military, operation, in, history, operation, barbarossa, the, bloodiest, battle, in, history, stalingrad, the, most, lethal, siege, in, history, leningrad, and, the, single, largest, battle, in, the, history, kursk, all, occurred, on, the, eastern, front, the, distinctly, brutal, nature, of, warfare, on, the, eastern, front, was, exemplified, by, an, often, wilful, disregard, for, human, life, by, both, sides, it, was, also, reflected, in, the, ideological, premise, for, the, war, which, saw, a, momentous, clash, between, two, directly, opposed, ideologies, aside, from, the, ideological, conflict, the, mindframe, of, the, leaders, of, germany, and, the, soviet, union, hitler, and, stalin, respectively, contributed, to, the, escalation, of, terror, and, murder, on, an, unprecedented, scale, stalin, and, hitler, both, disregarded, human, life, in, order, to, achieve, their, goal, of, victory, this, included, the, terrorisation, of, their, own, people, as, well, as, mass, deportations, of, entire, populations, all, these, factors, resulted, in, tremendous, brutality, both, to, combatants, and, civilians, that, found, no, parallel, on, the, western, front, according, to, time, magazine, by, measure, of, manpower, duration, territorial, reach, and, casualties, the, eastern, front, was, as, much, as, four, times, the, scale, of, the, conflict, on, the, western, front, that, opened, with, the, normandy, invasion, conversely, general, george, marshall, the, u, s, army, chief, of, staff, calculated, that, without, the, eastern, front, the, united, states, would, have, had, to, double, the, number, of, its, soldiers, on, the, western, front, memorandum, for, the, president, s, special, assistant, harry, hopkins, washington, d, c, 10, august, 1943, in, war, ii, russia, occupies, a, dominant, position, and, is, the, decisive, factor, looking, toward, the, defeat, of, the, axis, in, europe, while, in, sicily, the, forces, of, great, britain, and, the, united, states, are, being, opposed, by, 2, german, divisions, the, russian, front, is, receiving, attention, of, approximately, 200, german, divisions, whenever, the, allies, open, a, second, front, on, the, continent, it, will, be, decidedly, a, secondary, front, to, that, of, russia, theirs, will, continue, to, be, the, main, effort, without, russia, in, the, war, the, axis, cannot, be, defeated, in, europe, and, the, position, of, the, united, nations, becomes, precarious, similarly, russia, s, post, war, position, in, europe, will, be, a, dominant, one, with, germany, crushed, there, is, no, power, in, europe, to, oppose, her, tremendous, military, forces, the, war, inflicted, huge, losses, and, suffering, upon, the, civilian, populations, of, the, affected, countries, behind, the, front, lines, atrocities, against, civilians, in, german, occupied, areas, were, routine, including, those, carried, out, as, part, of, the, holocaust, german, and, german, allied, forces, treated, civilian, populations, with, exceptional, brutality, massacring, whole, village, populations, and, routinely, killing, civilian, hostages, see, german, war, crimes, both, sides, practised, widespread, scorched, earth, tactics, but, the, loss, of, civilian, lives, in, the, case, of, germany, was, incomparably, smaller, than, that, of, the, soviet, union, in, which, at, least, 20, million, were, killed, according, to, british, historian, geoffrey, hosking, the, full, demographic, loss, to, the, soviet, peoples, was, even, greater, since, a, high, proportion, of, those, killed, were, young, men, of, child, begetting, age, the, postwar, soviet, population, was, 45, to, 50, million, smaller, than, post, 1939, projections, would, have, led, one, to, expect, when, the, red, army, invaded, germany, in, 1944, many, german, civilians, suffered, from, reprisals, by, red, army, soldiers, see, soviet, war, crimes, after, the, war, following, the, yalta, conference, agreements, between, the, allies, the, german, populations, of, east, prussia, and, silesia, were, displaced, to, the, west, of, the, oder, neisse, line, in, what, became, one, of, the, largest, forced, migrations, of, people, in, world, history, the, soviet, union, came, out, of, world, war, ii, militarily, victorious, but, economically, and, structurally, devastated, much, of, the, combat, took, place, in, or, close, to, populated, areas, and, the, actions, of, both, sides, contributed, to, massive, loss, of, civilian, life, and, tremendous, material, damage, according, to, a, summary, presented, by, lieutenant, general, roman, rudenko, at, the, international, military, tribunal, in, nuremberg, the, property, damage, in, the, soviet, union, inflicted, by, the, axis, invasion, was, estimated, to, a, value, of, 679, billion, rubles, the, largest, number, of, civilian, deaths, in, a, single, city, was, 1, 2, million, citizens, dead, during, the, siege, of, leningrad, the, combined, damage, consisted, of, complete, or, partial, destruction, of, 1, 710, cities, and, towns, 70, 000, villages, hamlets, 2, 508, church, buildings, 31, 850, industrial, establishments, 64, 000, kilometres, 40, 000, mi, of, railroad, 4, 100, railroad, stations, 40, 000, hospitals, 84, 000, schools, and, 43, 000, public, libraries, leaving, 25, million, homeless, seven, million, horses, 17, million, cattle, 20, million, pigs, 27, million, sheep, were, also, slaughtered, or, driven, off, wild, fauna, were, also, affected, wolves, and, foxes, fleeing, westward, from, the, killing, zone, as, the, soviet, army, advanced, between, 1943, and, 1945, were, responsible, for, a, rabies, epidemic, that, spread, slowly, westwards, reaching, the, coast, of, the, english, channel, by, 1968, the, soviet, union, and, nazi, germany, were, both, ideologically, driven, states, by, soviet, communism, and, by, nazism, respectively, in, which, the, foremost, political, leaders, had, near, absolute, power, the, character, of, the, war, was, thus, determined, by, the, political, leaders, and, their, ideology, to, a, much, greater, extent, than, in, any, other, theatre, of, world, war, ii, hitler, exercised, tight, control, over, the, german, war, effort, spending, much, of, his, time, in, his, command, bunkers, most, notably, at, rastenburg, in, east, prussia, at, vinnitsa, in, ukraine, and, under, the, garden, of, the, reich, chancellery, in, berlin, at, crucial, periods, in, the, war, he, held, daily, situation, conferences, at, which, he, used, his, remarkable, talent, for, public, speaking, to, overwhelm, opposition, from, his, generals, and, from, the, okw, staff, with, rhetoric, in, part, because, of, the, unexpected, degree, of, german, success, in, the, battle, of, france, despite, the, warnings, of, the, professional, military, hitler, believed, himself, a, military, genius, with, a, grasp, of, the, total, war, effort, that, eluded, his, generals, in, august, 1941, when, walther, von, brauchitsch, commander, in, chief, of, the, wehrmacht, and, fedor, von, bock, appealed, for, an, attack, on, moscow, hitler, instead, ordered, the, encirclement, and, capture, of, ukraine, in, order, to, acquire, the, farmland, industry, and, natural, resources, of, that, country, some, historians, like, bevin, alexander, in, how, hitler, could, have, won, regard, this, decision, as, a, missed, opportunity, to, win, the, war, in, the, winter, of, 1941, 1942, hitler, believed, that, his, obstinate, refusal, to, allow, the, german, armies, to, retreat, had, saved, army, group, centre, from, collapse, he, later, told, erhard, milch, i, had, to, act, ruthlessly, i, had, to, send, even, my, closest, generals, packing, two, army, generals, for, example, i, could, only, tell, these, gentlemen, get, yourself, back, to, germany, as, rapidly, as, you, can, but, leave, the, army, in, my, charge, and, the, army, is, staying, at, the, front, the, success, of, this, hedgehog, defence, outside, moscow, led, hitler, to, insist, on, the, holding, of, territory, when, it, made, no, military, sense, and, to, sack, generals, who, retreated, without, orders, officers, with, initiative, were, replaced, with, yes, men, or, with, fanatical, nazis, the, disastrous, encirclements, later, in, the, war, at, stalingrad, korsun, and, many, other, places, resulted, directly, from, hitler, s, orders, this, idea, of, holding, territory, led, to, another, failed, plan, dubbed, heaven, bound, missions, which, involved, fortifying, even, the, most, unimportant, or, insignificant, of, cities, and, the, holding, of, these, fortresses, at, all, costs, many, divisions, became, cut, off, in, fortress, cities, or, wasted, uselessly, in, secondary, theatres, because, hitler, would, not, sanction, retreat, or, voluntarily, abandon, any, of, his, conquests, frustration, at, hitler, s, leadership, in, the, war, was, one, of, the, factors, in, the, attempted, coup, d, etat, of, 1944, but, after, the, failure, of, the, 20, july, plot, hitler, considered, the, army, and, its, officer, corps, suspect, and, came, to, rely, on, the, schutzstaffel, ss, and, nazi, party, members, to, prosecute, the, war, hitler, s, direction, of, the, war, ultimately, proved, disastrous, for, the, german, army, though, the, skill, loyalty, professionalism, and, endurance, of, officers, and, soldiers, enabled, him, to, keep, germany, fighting, to, the, end, f, w, winterbotham, wrote, of, hitler, s, signal, to, gerd, von, rundstedt, to, continue, the, attack, to, the, west, during, the, battle, of, the, bulge, from, experience, we, had, learned, that, when, hitler, started, refusing, to, do, what, the, generals, recommended, things, started, to, go, wrong, and, this, was, to, be, no, exception, stalin, bore, the, greatest, responsibility, for, some, of, the, disasters, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, for, example, the, battle, of, kiev, in, 1941, but, equally, deserves, praise, for, the, subsequent, success, of, the, soviet, red, army, which, depended, on, the, unprecedentedly, rapid, industrialisation, of, the, soviet, union, which, stalin, s, internal, policy, had, made, the, first, priority, throughout, the, 1930s, stalin, s, great, purge, of, the, red, army, in, the, late, 1930s, involved, the, legal, prosecution, of, many, of, the, senior, command, many, of, whom, the, courts, convicted, and, sentenced, to, death, or, to, imprisonment, the, executed, included, mikhail, tukhachevsky, a, proponent, of, armoured, blitzkrieg, stalin, promoted, some, obscurantists, like, grigory, kulik, who, opposed, the, mechanisation, of, the, army, and, the, production, of, tanks, but, on, the, other, hand, purged, the, older, commanders, who, had, held, their, positions, since, the, russian, civil, war, of, 1917, 1922, and, who, had, experience, but, were, deemed, politically, unreliable, this, opened, up, their, places, to, the, promotion, of, many, younger, officers, that, stalin, and, the, nkvd, regarded, as, in, line, with, stalinist, politics, many, of, these, newly, promoted, commanders, proved, terribly, inexperienced, but, some, later, became, very, successful, soviet, tank, output, remained, the, largest, in, the, world, from, the, foundation, of, the, red, army, in, 1918, political, distrust, of, the, military, had, led, to, a, system, of, dual, command, with, every, commander, paired, with, a, political, commissar, a, member, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, larger, units, had, military, councils, consisting, of, the, commander, commissar, and, chief, of, staff, commissars, ensured, the, loyalty, of, the, commanding, officers, and, implemented, party, orders, following, the, soviet, occupation, of, eastern, poland, of, the, baltic, states, and, of, bessarabia, and, northern, bukovina, in, 1939, 1940, stalin, insisted, on, the, occupation, of, every, fold, of, the, newly, sovietized, territories, this, move, westward, positioned, troops, far, from, their, depots, in, salients, that, left, them, vulnerable, to, encirclement, as, tension, heightened, in, spring, 1941, stalin, desperately, tried, not, to, give, hitler, any, provocation, that, berlin, could, use, as, an, excuse, for, a, german, attack, stalin, refused, to, allow, the, military, to, go, on, the, alert, even, as, german, troops, gathered, on, the, borders, and, german, reconnaissance, planes, overflew, installations, this, refusal, to, take, necessary, action, was, instrumental, in, the, destruction, of, major, portions, of, the, red, air, force, lined, up, on, its, airfields, in, the, first, days, of, the, german, soviet, war, at, the, crisis, of, the, war, in, the, autumn, of, 1942, stalin, made, many, concessions, to, the, army, the, government, restored, unitary, command, by, removing, the, commissars, from, the, chain, of, command, order, 25, of, 15, january, 1943, introduced, shoulderboards, for, all, ranks, this, represented, a, significant, symbolic, step, since, after, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, shoulderboards, had, connotations, as, a, symbol, of, the, old, tsarist, r, gime, beginning, in, autumn, 1941, units, that, had, proved, themselves, by, superior, performance, in, combat, were, given, the, traditional, guards, title, these, concessions, were, combined, with, ruthless, discipline, order, no, 227, issued, on, 28, july, 1942, threatened, commanders, who, retreated, without, orders, with, punishment, by, court, martial, infractions, by, military, and, politruks, were, punished, with, transferral, to, penal, battalions, and, to, penal, companies, which, carried, out, especially, hazardous, duties, such, as, serving, as, tramplers, to, clear, nazi, minefields, the, order, stipulated, to, capture, or, shoot, cowards, and, fleeing, panicked, troops, at, the, rear, where, blocking, detachments, were, ordered, to, be, set, up, in, the, first, three, months, after, order, no, 227, was, promulgated, 1, 000, retreating, troops, were, shot, and, 24, 993, were, sent, to, penal, battalions, by, october, 1942, the, idea, of, regular, blocking, detachments, was, quietly, dropped, by, 29, october, 1944, the, units, were, officially, disbanded, as, it, became, clear, that, the, soviet, union, would, win, the, war, stalin, ensured, that, propaganda, always, mentioned, his, leadership, of, the, war, he, sidelined, the, victorious, generals, and, never, allowed, them, to, develop, into, political, rivals, after, the, war, the, soviets, once, again, purged, the, red, army, though, not, as, brutally, as, in, the, 1930s, and, demoted, many, successful, officers, including, zhukov, rodion, malinovsky, and, ivan, koniev, to, unimportant, positions, hitler, s, first, defeats, on, the, frontline, outside, moscow, drove, him, to, endorse, plans, for, the, total, extermination, of, the, jews, and, almost, simultaneously, to, openly, intensify, the, anti, slavic, slogans, of, anti, bolshevist, and, anti, semitic, propaganda, then, in, 1943, came, the, call, for, total, war, total, war, meant, further, suffering, and, murders, inflicted, on, millions, millions, of, people, perished, heirless, and, nameless, the, enormous, territorial, gains, of, 1941, presented, germany, with, vast, areas, to, pacify, and, administer, for, the, majority, of, people, of, the, soviet, union, the, nazi, invasion, was, viewed, as, a, brutal, act, of, unprovoked, aggression, while, it, is, important, to, note, that, not, all, parts, of, soviet, society, viewed, the, german, advance, in, this, way, the, majority, of, the, soviet, population, viewed, german, forces, as, occupiers, in, areas, such, as, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, which, had, been, annexed, by, the, soviet, union, in, 1940, the, wehrmacht, was, tolerated, by, a, relatively, more, significant, part, of, the, native, population, this, was, particularly, true, for, the, territories, of, western, ukraine, recently, rejoined, to, the, soviet, union, where, the, anti, polish, and, anti, soviet, ukrainian, nationalist, underground, hoped, in, vain, to, establish, the, independent, state, relying, on, german, armed, force, however, soviet, society, as, a, whole, was, hostile, to, the, invading, nazis, from, the, very, start, the, nascent, national, liberation, movements, among, ukrainians, and, cossacks, and, others, were, viewed, by, hitler, with, suspicion, some, especially, those, from, the, baltic, states, were, co, opted, into, the, axis, armies, and, others, brutally, suppressed, none, of, the, conquered, territories, gained, any, measure, of, self, rule, instead, the, nazi, ideologues, saw, the, future, of, the, east, as, one, of, settlement, by, german, colonists, with, the, natives, killed, expelled, or, reduced, to, slave, labour, the, cruel, and, brutally, inhumane, treatment, of, soviet, civilians, women, children, and, elderly, the, daily, bombings, of, civilian, cities, and, towns, nazi, pillaging, of, soviet, villages, and, hamlets, and, unprecedented, harsh, punishment, and, treatment, of, civilians, in, general, were, some, of, the, primary, reasons, for, soviet, resistance, to, nazi, germany, s, invasion, indeed, the, soviets, viewed, germany, s, invasion, as, an, act, of, aggression, and, an, attempt, to, conquer, and, enslave, the, local, population, regions, closer, to, the, front, were, managed, by, military, powers, of, the, region, in, other, areas, such, as, the, baltic, states, annexed, by, the, ussr, in, 1940, reichscommissariats, were, established, as, a, rule, the, maximum, in, loot, was, extracted, in, september, 1941, erich,

the, deaths, from, the, nazi, occupation, many, hundreds, of, thousands, of, soviet, civilians, were, executed, and, millions, more, died, from, starvation, as, the, germans, requisitioned, food, for, their, armies, and, fodder, for, their, draft, horses, as, they, retreated, from, ukraine, and, belarus, in, 1943, 44, the, german, occupiers, systematically, applied, a, scorched, earth, policy, burning, towns, and, cities, destroying, infrastructure, and, leaving, civilians, to, starve, or, die, of, exposure, in, many, towns, the, battles, were, fought, within, towns, and, cities, with,
