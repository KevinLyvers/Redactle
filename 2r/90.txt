history, covers, the, eighteenth, nineteenth, and, twentieth, dynasties, through, radiocarbon, dating, the, establishment, of, the, new, kingdom, has, been, placed, between, 1570, bc, and, 1544, bc,

would, evolve, significantly, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, later, part, of, this, period, under, the, nineteenth, dynasty, 1295, 1189, bc, and, the, twentieth, dynasty, 1189, 1069, bc, is, also, known, as, the, ramesside, period, it, is, named, after, the, eleven, pharaohs, who, took, the, name, ramesses, after, ramesses, i, the, founder, of, the, nineteenth, dynasty, and, his, grandson, ramesses, ii, its, longest, reigning, monarch, possibly, as, a, result, of, the, foreign, rule, of, the, hyksos, during, the, second, intermediate, period, the, new, kingdom, saw, a, historic, expansion, into, the, levant, thus, marking, egypt, s, greatest, territorial, extent, similarly, in, response, to, attacks, by, the, kushites, who, led, raids, into, egypt, during, the, second, intermediate, period, the, rulers, of, the, new, kingdom, felt, compelled, to, expand, far, into, nubia, and, to, hold, wider, territories, in, the, near, east, particularly, on, the, levantine, frontier, the, eighteenth, dynasty, included, some, of, egypt, s, most, famous, kings, including, ahmose, i, hatshepsut, thutmose, iii, amenhotep, iii, akhenaten, and, tutankhamun, ahmose, i, is, viewed, to, be, the, founder, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, he, continued, the, campaigns, of, his, father, seqenenre, tao, and, of, kamose, against, the, hyksos, until, he, reunified, the, country, once, more, ahmose, would, then, continue, to, campaign, in, the, levant, the, home, of, the, hyksos, to, prevent, any, future, invasions, on, egypt, ahmose, was, followed, by, amenhotep, i, who, campaigned, in, nubia, and, was, followed, by, thutmose, i, thutmose, i, campaigned, in, the, levant, and, reached, as, far, as, the, euphrates, thus, becoming, the, first, pharaoh, to, cross, the, river, during, this, campaign, the, syrian, princes, declared, allegiance, to, thutmose, however, after, he, returned, they, discontinued, tribute, and, began, fortifying, against, future, incursions, hatshepsut, was, one, of, the, most, powerful, pharaohs, of, this, dynasty, she, was, the, daughter, of, thutmose, i, and, the, royal, wife, of, thutmose, ii, upon, the, death, of, her, husband, she, ruled, jointly, with, his, son, by, a, minor, wife, thutmose, iii, who, had, ascended, to, the, throne, as, a, child, of, about, two, years, of, age, but, eventually, she, ruled, in, her, own, right, as, king, hatshepsut, built, extensively, in, the, karnak, temple, in, luxor, and, throughout, all, of, egypt, and, she, re, established, the, trade, networks, that, had, been, disrupted, during, the, hyksos, rule, of, lower, egypt, during, the, second, intermediate, period, thereby, building, the, wealth, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, she, oversaw, the, preparations, and, funding, for, a, mission, to, the, land, of, punt, after, her, death, having, gained, valuable, experience, heading, up, the, military, for, hatshepsut, thutmose, iii, assumed, rule, thutmose, iii, expanded, egypt, s, army, and, wielded, it, with, great, success, to, consolidate, the, empire, created, by, his, predecessors, this, resulted, in, a, peak, in, egypt, s, power, and, wealth, during, the, reign, of, amenhotep, iii, the, term, pharaoh, originally, the, name, of, the, king, s, palace, became, a, form, of, address, for, the, person, who, was, king, during, his, reign, c, 1479, 1425, bc, widely, considered, a, military, genius, by, historians, thutmose, iii, conducted, at, least, 16, campaigns, in, 20, years, he, was, an, active, expansionist, ruler, he, is, recorded, to, have, captured, 350, cities, during, his, rule, and, conquered, much, of, the, near, east, from, the, euphrates, to, nubia, during, seventeen, known, military, campaigns, he, was, the, first, pharaoh, after, thutmose, i, to, cross, the, euphrates, doing, so, during, his, campaign, against, mitanni, he, continued, north, through, the, territory, belonging, to, the, still, unconquered, cities, of, aleppo, and, carchemish, and, quickly, crossed, the, euphrates, in, his, boats, taking, the, mitannian, king, entirely, by, surprise, the, wealthiest, of, all, the, kings, of, this, dynasty, is, amenhotep, iii, who, built, the, luxor, temple, the, precinct, of, monthu, at, karnak, and, his, massive, mortuary, temple, amenhotep, iii, also, built, the, malkata, palace, the, largest, built, in, egypt, one, of, the, best, known, eighteenth, dynasty, pharaohs, is, amenhotep, iv, who, changed, his, name, to, akhenaten, in, honour, of, the, aten, a, representation, of, the, egyptian, god, ra, his, worship, of, the, aten, as, his, personal, deity, is, often, interpreted, as, history, s, first, instance, of, monotheism, akhenaten, s, wife, nefertiti, contributed, a, great, deal, to, his, new, direction, in, the, egyptian, religion, nefertiti, was, bold, enough, to, perform, rituals, to, aten, akhenaten, s, religious, fervour, is, cited, as, the, reason, why, he, and, his, wife, were, subsequently, written, out, of, egyptian, history, under, his, reign, in, the, fourteenth, century, bc, egyptian, art, flourished, in, a, distinctive, new, style, see, amarna, period, by, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, egypt, s, status, had, changed, radically, aided, by, akhenaten, s, apparent, lack, of, interest, in, international, affairs, the, hittites, had, gradually, extended, their, influence, into, the, levant, to, become, a, major, power, in, international, politics, a, power, that, both, seti, i, and, his, son, ramesses, ii, would, confront, during, the, nineteenth, dynasty, the, last, two, members, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, ay, and, horemheb, became, rulers, from, the, ranks, of, officials, in, the, royal, court, although, ay, might, also, have, been, the, maternal, uncle, of, akhenaten, and, a, fellow, descendant, of, yuya, and, tjuyu, ay, may, have, married, the, widowed, great, royal, wife, and, young, half, sister, of, tutankhamun, ankhesenamun, in, order, to, obtain, power, she, did, not, live, long, afterward, ay, then, married, tey, who, originally, had, been, wet, nurse, to, nefertiti, ay, s, reign, was, short, his, successor, was, horemheb, a, general, during, the, reign, of, tutankhamun, whom, the, pharaoh, may, have, intended, as, his, successor, in, the, event, that, he, had, no, surviving, children, which, came, to, pass, horemheb, may, have, taken, the, throne, away, from, ay, in, a, coup, d, tat, although, ay, s, son, or, stepson, nakhtmin, was, named, as, his, father, or, stepfather, s, crown, prince, nakhtmin, seems, to, have, died, during, the, reign, of, ay, leaving, the, opportunity, for, horemheb, to, claim, the, throne, next, horemheb, also, died, without, surviving, children, having, appointed, his, vizier, pa, ra, mes, su, as, his, heir, this, vizier, ascended, the, throne, in, 1292, bc, as, ramesses, i, and, was, the, first, pharaoh, of, the, nineteenth, dynasty, the, nineteenth, dynasty, was, founded, by, the, vizier, ramesses, i, whom, the, last, ruler, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, pharaoh, horemheb, had, chosen, as, his, successor, his, brief, reign, marked, a, transition, period, between, the, reign, of, horemheb, and, the, powerful, pharaohs, of, this, dynasty, in, particular, his, son, seti, i, and, grandson, ramesses, ii, who, would, bring, egypt, to, new, heights, of, imperial, power, seti, i, fought, a, series, of, wars, in, western, asia, libya, and, nubia, in, the, first, decade, of, his, reign, the, main, source, for, knowledge, of, seti, s, military, activities, are, his, battle, scenes, on, the, north, exterior, wall, of, the, karnak, hypostyle, hall, along, with, several, royal, stelas, with, inscriptions, mentioning, battles, in, canaan, and, nubia, the, greatest, achievement, of, seti, i, s, foreign, policy, was, the, capture, of, the, syrian, town, of, kadesh, and, neighboring, territory, of, amurru, from, the, hittite, empire, egypt, had, not, held, kadesh, since, the, time, of, akhenaten, seti, i, was, successful, in, defeating, a, hittite, army, that, tried, to, defend, the, town, and, erected, a, victory, stela, at, the, site, which, has, been, found, by, archaeologists, kadesh, however, soon, reverted, to, hittite, control, because, the, egyptians, did, not, or, could, not, maintain, a, permanent, military, occupation, of, kadesh, and, amurru, which, were, close, to, the, hittite, homelands, ramesses, ii, sought, to, recover, territories, in, the, levant, that, had, been, held, by, the, 18th, dynasty, in, his, second, year, before, confronting, the, hittites, ramesses, ii, had, to, deal, with, a, raid, by, the, sherden, sea, people, whom, he, defeated, and, incorporated, into, his, army, his, campaigns, against, the, hittites, culminated, in, the, battle, of, kadesh, where, he, led, egyptian, armies, against, those, of, the, hittite, king, muwatalli, ii, ramesses, was, caught, in, history, s, first, recorded, military, ambush, although, he, was, able, to, rally, his, troops, and, turn, the, tide, of, battle, against, the, hittites, thanks, to, the, arrival, of, the, ne, arin, possibly, mercenaries, in, the, employ, of, egypt, the, outcome, of, the, battle, was, undecided, with, both, sides, claiming, victory, at, their, home, front, and, ultimately, resulting, in, a, peace, treaty, between, the, two, governments, he, campaigned, later, in, the, levant, capturing, edom, and, moab, new, kingdom, egyptian, stelae, from, this, period, have, been, found, in, jordan, later, egyptians, conquered, qatna, and, tunip, where, a, statue, of, ramses, ii, was, erected, thus, he, recaptured, qadesh, and, northern, amurru, nevertheless, like, seti, i, he, found, that, he, could, not, permanently, hold, territory, so, far, from, base, and, after, years, of, conflict, a, peace, treaty, was, concluded, between, the, two, states, egypt, was, able, to, obtain, wealth, and, stability, under, the, rule, of, ramesses, for, more, than, half, a, century, his, immediate, successors, continued, the, military, campaigns, although, an, increasingly, troubled, court, which, at, one, point, put, a, usurper, amenmesse, on, the, throne, made, it, increasingly, difficult, for, a, pharaoh, to, effectively, retain, control, of, the, territories, ramesses, ii, built, extensively, throughout, egypt, and, nubia, and, his, cartouches, are, prominently, displayed, even, in, buildings, that, he, did, not, construct, there, are, accounts, of, his, honor, hewn, on, stone, statues, and, the, remains, of, palaces, and, temples, most, notably, the, ramesseum, in, western, thebes, and, the, rock, temples, of, abu, simbel, he, covered, the, land, from, the, delta, to, nubia, with, buildings, in, a, way, no, king, before, him, had, he, also, founded, a, new, capital, city, in, the, delta, during, his, reign, called, pi, ramesses, it, previously, had, served, as, a, summer, palace, during, the, reign, of, seti, i, ramesses, ii, constructed, many, large, monuments, including, the, archaeological, complex, of, abu, simbel, and, the, mortuary, temple, known, as, the, ramesseum, he, built, on, a, monumental, scale, to, ensure, that, his, legacy, would, survive, the, ravages, of, time, ramesses, used, art, as, a, means, of, propaganda, for, his, victories, over, foreigners, which, are, depicted, on, numerous, temple, reliefs, ramesses, ii, erected, more, colossal, statues, of, himself, than, any, other, pharaoh, and, also, usurped, many, existing, statues, by, inscribing, his, own, cartouche, on, them, ramesses, ii, was, also, famed, for, the, huge, number, of, children, he, sired, by, his, various, wives, and, concubines, the, tomb, he, built, for, his, sons, many, of, whom, he, outlived, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, has, proven, to, be, the, largest, funerary, complex, in, egypt, the, immediate, successors, of, ramesses, ii, continued, the, military, campaigns, although, an, increasingly, troubled, court, complicated, matters, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, merneptah, and, then, by, merneptah, s, son, seti, ii, seti, ii, s, right, to, the, throne, seems, to, have, been, disputed, by, his, half, brother, amenmesse, who, may, have, temporarily, ruled, from, thebes, upon, his, death, seti, ii, s, son, siptah, who, may, have, been, afflicted, with, poliomyelitis, during, his, life, was, appointed, to, the, throne, by, bay, a, chancellor, and, a, west, asian, commoner, who, served, as, vizier, behind, the, scenes, siptah, died, early, and, throne, was, assumed, by, twosret, who, was, the, royal, wife, of, his, father, and, possibly, his, uncle, amenmesse, s, sister, a, period, of, anarchy, at, the, end, of, twosret, s, short, reign, saw, the, enthronement, of, setnakhte, establishing, the, twentieth, dynasty, the, last, great, pharaoh, from, the, new, kingdom, is, widely, considered, to, be, ramesses, iii, a, twentieth, dynasty, pharaoh, who, reigned, several, decades, after, ramesses, ii, in, the, eighth, year, of, his, reign, the, sea, peoples, invaded, egypt, by, land, and, sea, ramesses, iii, defeated, them, in, two, great, land, and, sea, battles, the, battle, of, djahy, and, the, battle, of, the, delta, he, incorporated, them, as, subject, peoples, and, is, thought, to, have, settled, them, in, southern, canaan, although, there, is, evidence, that, they, forced, their, way, into, canaan, their, presence, in, canaan, may, have, contributed, to, the, formation, of, new, states, such, as, philistia, in, this, region, after, the, collapse, of, the, egyptian, empire, in, the, reign, of, ramses, iii, himself, egyptian, presence, in, the, levant, is, still, attested, as, far, as, byblos, he, later, was, compelled, to, fight, invading, libyan, tribesmen, in, two, major, campaigns, in, egypt, s, western, delta, in, his, sixth, year, and, eleventh, year, respectively, the, heavy, cost, of, this, warfare, slowly, drained, egypt, s, treasury, and, contributed, to, the, gradual, decline, of, the, egyptian, empire, in, asia, the, severity, of, the, difficulties, is, indicated, by, the, fact, that, the, first, known, labour, strike, in, recorded, history, occurred, during, the, twenty, ninth, year, of, ramesses, iii, s, reign, at, that, time, the, food, rations, for, egypt, s, favoured, and, elite, royal, tomb, builders, and, artisans, in, the, village, of, deir, el, medina, could, not, be, provisioned, air, pollution, limited, the, amount, of, sunlight, penetrating, the, atmosphere, affecting, agricultural, production, and, arresting, global, tree, growth, for, almost, two, full, decades, until, 1140, bc, one, proposed, cause, is, the, hekla, 3, eruption, of, the, hekla, volcano, in, iceland, but, the, dating, of, this, remains, disputed, near, the, end, of, ramesses, iii, s, reign, one, of, his, secondary, wives, plotted, to, assassinate, the, king, in, her, quest, to, place, her, son, on, the, throne, palace, personnel, the, harem, government, officials, and, army, officers, participated, in, the, plot, a, special, court, of, 12, judges, was, formed, to, try, the, defendants, who, were, sentenced, to, death, written, sources, show, that, the, coup, failed, and, that, the, conspirators, were, successfully, tried, however, it, is, not, clear, from, the, documents, whether, ramses, survived, the, assassination, attempt, the, king, s, mummy, showed, no, visible, wounds, and, questions, about, his, fate, were, left, open, to, speculation, for, many, years, in, 2012, researchers, announced, that, a, ct, scan, had, revealed, a, deep, knife, wound, in, the, mummy, s, throat, indicating, that, ramesses, was, indeed, killed, by, the, conspirators, he, died, in, thebes, in, the, 32nd, year, of, his, reign, and, was, succeeded, by, crown, prince, ramesses, iv, a, number, of, raids, by, the, libyans, and, the, sea, people, more, dangerous, than, those, during, the, reign, of, ramses, iii, drew, the, kingdom, to, more, weakness, this, increased, the, influence, of, the, priests, of, amon, which, finally, led, to, the, control, of, the, great, priests, on, the, throne, ramesses, iii, s, death, was, followed, by, years, of, bickering, among, his, heirs, three, of, his, sons, ascended, the, throne, successively, as, ramesses, iv, rameses, vi, and, rameses, viii, egypt, was, increasingly, beset, by, droughts, below, normal, flooding, of, the, nile, famine, civil, unrest, and, corruption, of, officials, the, power, of, the, last, pharaoh, of, the, dynasty, ramesses, xi, grew, so, weak, that, in, the, south, the, high, priests, of, amun, at, thebes, became, the, de, facto, rulers, of, upper, egypt, and, smendes, controlled, lower, egypt, in, the, north, even, before, rameses, xi, s, death, smendes, eventually, founded, the, twenty, first, dynasty, at, tanis
