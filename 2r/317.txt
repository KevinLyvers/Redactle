the, wars, of, the, roses, known, at, the, time, and, in, following, centuries, as, the, civil, wars, were, a, series, of, civil, wars, fought, over, control, of, the, english, throne, from, 1455, to, 1487, the, wars, were, fought, between, supporters, of, the, house, of, lancaster, and, house, of, york, two, rival, cadet, branches, of, the, royal, house, of, plantagenet, the, conflict, resulted, in, the, end, of, lancaster, s, male, line, in, 1471, leaving, the, tudor, family, to, inherit, their, claim, to, the, throne, through, the, female, line, conflict, was, largely, brought, to, an, end, upon, the, union, of, the, two, houses, through, marriage, creating, the, tudor, dynasty, that, would, subsequently, rule, england, the, wars, of, the, roses, were, rooted, in, english, socio, economic, troubles, caused, by, the, hundred, years, war, 1337, 1453, with, france, as, well, as, the, quasi, military, bastard, feudalism, resulting, from, the, powerful, duchies, created, by, king, edward, iii, the, mental, instability, of, king, henry, vi, of, the, house, of, lancaster, revived, his, cousin, richard, duke, of, york, s, interest, in, a, claim, to, the, throne, warfare, began, in, 1455, with, york, s, capture, of, henry, at, the, first, battle, of, st, albans, upon, which, york, was, appointed, lord, protector, by, parliament, fighting, resumed, four, years, later, when, yorkists, led, by, richard, neville, earl, of, warwick, captured, henry, again, at, the, battle, of, northampton, after, attempting, to, seize, the, throne, york, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, wakefield, and, his, son, edward, inherited, his, claim, per, the, controversial, act, of, accord, the, yorkists, lost, custody, of, henry, in, 1461, after, the, second, battle, of, st, albans, but, defeated, the, lancastrians, at, the, battle, of, towton, the, yorkist, edward, was, formally, crowned, in, june, 1461, in, 1464, edward, married, elizabeth, woodville, against, the, advice, of, warwick, and, reversed, warwick, s, policy, of, seeking, closer, ties, with, france, warwick, rebelled, against, edward, in, 1469, leading, to, edward, s, imprisonment, after, warwick, s, supporters, defeated, a, yorkist, army, at, the, battle, of, edgcote, edward, was, allowed, to, resume, his, rule, after, warwick, failed, to, replace, him, with, his, brother, george, of, clarence, within, a, year, warwick, launched, an, invasion, of, england, alongside, henry, vi, s, wife, margaret, of, anjou, edward, fled, to, flanders, and, henry, vi, was, restored, as, king, in, 1470, edward, mounted, a, counter, invasion, with, aid, from, burgundy, a, few, months, later, and, killed, warwick, at, the, battle, of, barnet, henry, was, returned, to, prison, and, his, sole, heir, later, killed, by, edward, at, the, battle, of, tewkesbury, followed, by, henry, s, own, death, in, the, tower, of, london, possibly, on, edward, s, orders, edward, ruled, unopposed, for, the, next, twelve, years, during, which, england, enjoyed, a, period, of, relative, peace, upon, his, death, in, april, 1483, he, was, succeeded, by, the, twelve, year, old, edward, v, who, reigned, for, 78, days, until, being, deposed, by, his, uncle, richard, iii, richard, assumed, the, throne, amid, controversies, regarding, the, disappearance, of, edward, iv, s, two, sons, he, was, met, with, a, short, lived, but, major, revolt, and, a, wave, of, yorkist, defections, amid, the, chaos, henry, tudor, a, descendant, of, edward, iii, through, lady, margaret, beaufort, and, a, veteran, lancastrian, returned, from, exile, with, an, army, and, defeated, and, killed, richard, at, bosworth, field, in, 1485, tudor, then, assumed, the, english, throne, as, henry, vii, and, united, the, rival, houses, through, marriage, with, elizabeth, of, york, edward, iv, s, eldest, daughter, and, heir, the, wars, concluded, in, 1487, with, henry, vii, s, defeat, of, the, remaining, yorkist, opposition, at, stoke, field, the, house, of, tudor, would, rule, england, until, 1603, a, period, that, saw, the, strengthening, of, the, monarchy, and, the, end, of, the, medieval, period, in, england, the, name, wars, of, the, roses, refers, to, the, heraldic, badges, associated, with, the, two, rival, branches, of, the, royal, house, of, plantagenet, fighting, for, control, of, the, english, throne, the, white, rose, of, york, and, the, red, rose, of, lancaster, embryonic, forms, of, this, term, were, used, in, 1727, by, bevil, higgons, who, described, the, quarrel, between, the, two, roses, and, by, david, hume, in, the, history, of, england, 1754, 1761, the, people, divided, in, their, affections, took, different, symbols, of, party, the, partisans, of, the, house, of, lancaster, chose, the, red, rose, as, their, mark, of, distinction, those, of, york, were, denominated, from, the, white, and, these, civil, wars, were, thus, known, over, europe, by, the, name, of, the, quarrel, between, the, two, roses, the, modern, term, wars, of, the, roses, came, into, common, use, in, the, early, 19th, century, following, the, publication, of, the, 1829, novel, anne, of, geierstein, by, sir, walter, scott, scott, based, the, name, on, a, scene, in, william, shakespeare, s, play, henry, vi, part, 1, act, 2, scene, 4, set, in, the, gardens, of, the, temple, church, where, a, number, of, noblemen, and, a, lawyer, pick, red, or, white, roses, to, symbolically, display, their, loyalty, to, the, lancastrian, or, yorkist, faction, respectively, during, shakespeare, s, time, the, conflict, was, simply, referred, to, as, the, civil, wars, the, yorkist, faction, used, the, symbol, of, the, white, rose, from, early, in, the, conflict, but, the, red, rose, of, lancaster, was, introduced, only, after, the, victory, of, henry, tudor, at, the, battle, of, bosworth, field, in, 1485, after, henry, s, victory, and, marriage, to, elizabeth, of, york, the, heir, of, edward, iv, the, two, roses, were, combined, to, form, the, tudor, rose, to, symbolise, the, union, of, the, two, claims, the, use, of, the, rose, itself, as, a, cognizance, stemmed, from, edward, i, s, use, of, a, golden, rose, stalked, proper, often, owing, to, nobles, holding, multiple, titles, more, than, one, badge, was, used, edward, iv, for, example, used, both, his, sun, in, splendour, as, earl, of, march, but, also, his, father, s, falcon, and, fetterlock, as, duke, of, york, badges, were, not, always, distinct, at, the, battle, of, barnet, edward, s, sun, was, very, similar, to, the, earl, of, oxford, s, vere, star, which, caused, fatal, confusion, in, the, fighting, many, participants, wore, livery, badges, associated, with, their, immediate, liege, lords, or, patrons, the, wearing, of, livery, was, confined, to, those, in, continuous, employ, of, a, lord, thus, excluding, for, example, mercenary, companies, for, example, henry, tudor, s, forces, at, bosworth, fought, under, the, banner, of, a, red, dragon, while, the, yorkist, army, used, richard, iii, s, personal, device, of, a, white, boar, while, the, names, of, the, rival, houses, derive, from, the, cities, of, york, and, lancaster, the, corresponding, duchy, and, dukedom, had, little, to, do, with, these, cities, the, lands, and, offices, attached, to, the, duchy, of, lancaster, were, primarily, located, in, gloucestershire, north, wales, cheshire, and, ironically, in, yorkshire, while, the, estates, of, the, duke, of, york, were, spread, throughout, england, and, wales, with, many, in, the, welsh, marches, historians, disagree, over, which, factors, were, the, main, causes, of, the, wars, edward, iii, who, ruled, england, from, 1327, to, 1377, had, five, sons, who, survived, into, adulthood, edward, of, woodstock, the, black, prince, lionel, of, antwerp, john, of, gaunt, edmund, of, langley, and, thomas, of, woodstock, throughout, his, reign, he, created, duchies, for, his, sons, cornwall, in, 1337, for, edward, and, clarence, and, lancaster, in, 1362, for, lionel, and, john, respectively, edmund, and, thomas, became, the, dukes, of, york, and, gloucester, respectively, in, 1385, during, the, reign, of, richard, ii, dukedoms, had, hitherto, never, been, conferred, by, any, english, monarch, upon, a, subject, until, the, creation, of, the, duchy, of, cornwall, in, 1337, and, their, genesis, spawned, a, powerful, new, class, of, english, nobility, with, claims, to, the, throne, and, theoretically, enough, power, to, vie, for, it, since, the, new, duchies, provided, edward, s, sons, and, their, heirs, presumptive, with, an, income, independent, of, the, sovereign, or, the, state, thereby, allowing, them, to, establish, and, maintain, their, own, private, military, retinues, over, time, these, duchies, began, to, exacerbate, the, structural, defects, inherent, in, so, called, bastard, feudalism, a, somewhat, controversial, term, coined, in, 1885, by, historian, charles, plummer, but, largely, defined, by, plummer, s, contemporary, william, stubbs, during, the, reign, of, edward, s, grandfather, edward, i, stubbs, describes, a, substantive, shift, in, social, dynamics, in, which, the, conscription, based, feudal, levy, came, to, be, replaced, by, a, system, of, royal, payment, in, return, for, military, service, by, the, magnates, who, served, the, monarch, thus, instead, of, vassals, rendering, military, service, when, called, they, paid, a, portion, of, their, income, into, their, lord, s, treasury, who, would, supplement, the, owed, service, with, hired, retainers, these, retinues, were, known, as, affinities, essentially, a, collection, of, all, the, individuals, to, whom, a, lord, had, gathered, for, service, and, came, to, be, one, of, the, most, fundamentally, defining, aspects, of, bastard, feudalism, these, affinities, also, had, the, means, of, tying, the, more, powerful, magnates, to, the, lower, nobility, although, these, relationships, were, now, largely, defined, by, personal, connections, that, exhibited, reciprocal, benefit, rather, than, tenurial, or, feudal, relationships, that, preceded, bastard, feudalism, consequently, lords, could, now, raise, retinues, they, could, implicitly, trust, since, the, men, of, the, affinity, owed, their, positions, to, their, patron, these, affinities, were, often, much, larger, than, the, number, of, men, the, lord, actually, knew, since, the, members, of, the, affinity, also, knew, and, supported, each, other, under, the, reign, of, richard, ii, this, created, a, power, struggle, with, the, magnates, as, richard, sought, to, increase, the, size, of, his, own, affinities, as, a, counterweight, to, the, growing, retinues, of, his, nobles, the, retinues, of, the, magnates, became, powerful, enough, to, defend, the, interests, of, their, lord, against, even, the, authority, of, the, monarch, as, john, of, gaunt, and, later, his, son, henry, bolingbroke, did, against, richard, during, the, wars, disaffected, magnates, such, as, richard, of, york, and, warwick, the, kingmaker, were, able, to, rely, upon, their, complex, network, of, servants, and, retainers, to, successfully, defy, the, authority, of, henry, vi, the, house, of, lancaster, descended, from, john, of, gaunt, the, third, surviving, son, of, edward, iii, the, name, derives, from, gaunt, s, primary, title, as, duke, of, lancaster, which, he, held, by, right, of, his, spouse, blanche, of, lancaster, the, lancastrian, claim, on, the, throne, had, received, preference, from, edward, iii, which, explicitly, emphasised, the, male, line, of, descent, henry, iv, based, his, right, to, depose, richard, ii, and, subsequent, assumption, of, the, throne, upon, this, claim, since, it, could, be, argued, that, the, heir, presumptive, was, in, fact, edmund, mortimer, the, great, grandson, of, edward, iii, s, second, surviving, son, lionel, duke, of, clarence, however, mortimer, was, descended, through, the, female, line, inheriting, the, claim, from, his, grandmother, philippa, an, important, branch, of, the, house, of, lancaster, was, the, house, of, beaufort, whose, members, were, descended, from, gaunt, by, his, mistress, katherine, swynford, originally, illegitimate, they, were, legitimised, by, an, act, of, parliament, when, gaunt, and, katherine, later, married, however, henry, iv, excluded, them, from, the, line, of, succession, to, the, throne, the, house, of, york, descended, from, edmund, of, langley, the, fourth, surviving, son, of, edward, iii, and, younger, brother, of, john, of, gaunt, the, name, derives, from, langley, s, primary, title, as, duke, of, york, which, he, acquired, in, 1385, during, the, reign, of, his, nephew, richard, ii, the, yorkist, claim, on, the, throne, unlike, the, lancastrian, claim, was, based, upon, the, female, line, of, descent, as, descendants, of, lionel, the, duke, of, clarence, langley, s, second, son, richard, of, conisburgh, had, married, anne, de, mortimer, daughter, of, roger, mortimer, and, sister, of, edmund, mortimer, anne, s, grandmother, philippa, of, clarence, was, the, daughter, of, lionel, of, antwerp, during, the, fourteenth, century, the, mortimers, were, the, most, powerful, marcher, family, in, the, kingdom, g, m, trevelyan, wrote, that, the, wars, of, the, roses, were, to, a, large, extent, a, quarrel, between, welsh, marcher, lords, who, were, also, great, english, nobles, closely, related, to, the, english, throne, the, question, of, succession, following, the, death, of, edward, iii, in, 1377, is, said, by, mortimer, to, be, the, root, cause, of, the, wars, of, the, roses, although, edward, s, succession, seemed, secure, there, was, a, sudden, narrowing, in, the, direct, line, of, descent, near, the, end, of, his, reign, edward, s, two, eldest, sons, the, heir, apparent, edward, duke, of, cornwall, the, black, prince, and, lionel, duke, of, clarence, had, predeceased, their, father, in, 1376, and, 1368, respectively, edward, iii, was, survived, by, three, sons, with, claims, to, the, throne, john, of, gaunt, duke, of, lancaster, edmund, of, langley, 1st, duke, of, york, and, thomas, of, woodstock, 1st, duke, of, gloucester, the, black, prince, had, one, surviving, son, richard, who, had, a, claim, to, the, throne, based, upon, the, principle, that, the, son, of, the, heir, apparent, edward, in, this, case, had, priority, in, the, line, of, succession, over, his, uncles, thus, richard, had, a, superior, claim, to, the, throne, than, his, much, older, uncles, john, edmund, and, thomas, however, richard, was, a, minor, had, no, siblings, and, his, three, living, uncles, at, the, time, of, edward, iii, s, death, were, politically, powerful, and, ambitious, so, there, was, considerable, uncertainty, within, the, realm, over, who, should, inherit, the, throne, ultimately, edward, was, succeeded, by, his, grandson, who, was, crowned, richard, ii, at, just, 10, years, old, under, the, laws, of, primogeniture, if, richard, died, without, a, legitimate, heir, his, successors, would, be, the, descendants, of, lionel, of, antwerp, the, duke, of, clarence, edward, iii, s, second, eldest, son, clarence, s, only, child, his, daughter, philippa, married, into, the, mortimer, family, and, had, a, son, roger, mortimer, who, technically, would, have, the, best, legal, claim, of, succession, however, a, legal, decree, issued, by, edward, iii, in, 1376, introduced, complexity, into, the, question, of, succession, since, the, letters, patent, he, issued, limited, the, right, of, succession, to, his, male, line, which, placed, his, third, son, john, of, gaunt, ahead, of, clarence, s, descendants, since, the, latter, were, descended, through, the, female, line, richard, ii, also, known, as, richard, of, bordeaux, was, king, of, england, from, 1377, until, he, was, deposed, in, 1399, during, richard, s, first, years, as, king, government, was, in, the, hands, of, a, series, of, regency, councils, influenced, by, richard, s, uncles, john, of, gaunt, and, thomas, of, woodstock, england, then, faced, various, problems, most, notably, the, hundred, years, war, a, major, challenge, of, the, reign, was, the, peasants, revolt, in, 1381, and, the, young, king, played, a, central, part, in, the, successful, suppression, of, this, crisis, less, warlike, than, either, his, father, or, grandfather, he, sought, to, bring, an, end, to, the, hundred, years, war, a, firm, believer, in, the, royal, prerogative, richard, restrained, the, power, of, the, aristocracy, and, relied, on, a, private, retinue, for, military, protection, instead, in, contrast, to, his, grandfather, richard, cultivated, a, refined, atmosphere, centred, on, art, and, culture, at, court, in, which, the, king, was, an, elevated, figure, richard, s, reign, as, richard, ii, of, england, was, tumultuous, marked, by, increasing, dissension, between, the, monarch, and, several, of, the, most, powerful, nobles, richard, ruled, without, a, regency, council, despite, his, young, age, in, order, to, exclude, his, uncle, john, of, gaunt, the, duke, of, lancaster, from, wielding, legitimate, power, unpopular, taxes, which, funded, unsuccessful, military, expeditions, in, europe, triggered, the, peasant, s, revolt, in, 1381, and, parliament, s, refusal, to, cooperate, with, the, king, s, unpopular, lord, chancellor, michael, de, la, pole, created, a, political, crisis, that, seriously, threatened, to, dethrone, richard, richard, had, repeatedly, switched, his, choice, of, heir, throughout, his, reign, to, keep, his, political, enemies, at, bay, the, king, s, dependence, on, a, small, number, of, courtiers, caused, discontent, among, the, influential, and, in, 1387, control, of, government, was, taken, over, by, a, group, of, aristocrats, known, as, the, lords, appellant, by, 1389, richard, had, regained, control, and, for, the, next, eight, years, governed, in, relative, harmony, with, his, former, opponents, in, france, much, of, the, territory, conquered, by, edward, iii, had, been, lost, leading, richard, to, negotiate, a, peace, treaty, known, as, truce, of, leulinghem, with, charles, vi, in, july, 1389, the, peace, proposal, which, would, effectively, have, made, england, a, client, kingdom, of, france, was, derided, and, rejected, by, parliament, which, was, predominately, controlled, by, the, knights, fighting, the, war, richard, decided, to, negotiate, a, de, facto, peace, directly, with, charles, without, seeking, parliament, s, approval, and, agreed, to, marry, his, six, year, old, daughter, isabella, of, valois, richard, used, the, interim, peace, to, punish, his, political, rivals, in, 1397, he, took, his, revenge, on, the, appellants, many, of, whom, were, executed, or, exiled, the, next, two, years, have, been, described, by, historians, as, richard, s, tyranny, when, john, of, gaunt, died, in, 1399, richard, confiscated, the, lands, and, titles, of, gaunt, s, son, henry, bolingbroke, whom, he, had, exiled, to, france, in, 1398, in, may, 1399, richard, left, england, for, a, military, expedition, in, ireland, giving, bolingbroke, the, opportunity, to, return, to, england, henry, invaded, england, in, june, 1399, with, a, small, force, that, quickly, grew, in, numbers, meeting, little, resistance, with, the, support, of, much, of, the, disaffected, nobility, bolingbroke, deposed, richard, and, was, crowned, as, henry, iv, the, first, lancastrian, monarch, richard, is, thought, to, have, been, starved, to, death, in, captivity, although, questions, remain, regarding, his, final, fate, richard, s, posthumous, reputation, has, been, shaped, to, a, large, extent, by, william, shakespeare, whose, play, richard, ii, portrayed, richard, s, misrule, and, his, deposition, as, responsible, for, the, wars, of, the, roses, modern, historians, do, not, accept, this, interpretation, while, not, exonerating, richard, from, responsibility, for, his, own, deposition, while, probably, not, insane, as, many, historians, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, believed, he, may, have, had, a, personality, disorder, particularly, manifesting, itself, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, most, authorities, agree, that, his, policies, were, not, unrealistic, or, even, entirely, unprecedented, but, that, the, way, in, which, he, carried, them, out, was, unacceptable, to, the, political, establishment, leading, to, his, downfall, almost, immediately, after, assuming, the, throne, henry, iv, faced, an, attempted, deposition, known, as, the, epiphany, rising, in, 1400, by, john, montagu, 3rd, earl, of, salisbury, john, holland, 1st, duke, of, exeter, thomas, holland, 1st, duke, of, surrey, and, the, thomas, despenser, 1st, earl, of, gloucester, to, re, install, the, imprisoned, richard, as, king, the, attempt, failed, all, four, conspirators, were, executed, and, richard, died, shortly, thereafter, by, means, unknown, in, pontefract, castle, further, west, in, wales, the, welsh, had, generally, supported, richard, s, rule, and, welded, to, a, myriad, of, other, socio, economic, problems, the, accession, of, henry, triggered, a, major, rebellion, in, wales, led, by, owain, glynd, r, a, member, of, the, welsh, nobility, glynd, r, s, rebellion, would, outlast, henry, s, reign, and, would, not, end, until, 1415, during, the, revolt, glynd, r, received, aid, from, members, of, the, tudors, a, prominent, anglesey, family, and, maternal, cousins, of, glynd, r, himself, who, would, come, to, play, a, defining, role, in, the, coming, wars, of, the, roses, disputes, over, promises, of, land, money, and, royal, favour, in, exchange, for, their, continued, support, drove, the, house, of, percy, led, by, henry, percy, 1st, earl, of, northumberland, and, thomas, percy, 1st, earl, of, worcester, to, rebel, multiple, times, against, henry, the, first, challenge, was, defeated, at, shrewsbury, in, 1403, and, worcester, was, executed, while, a, second, attempt, failed, at, bramham, moor, in, 1408, at, which, northumberland, was, killed, henry, himself, died, in, 1413, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, henry, of, monmouth, who, was, crowned, henry, v, to, cement, his, position, as, king, both, domestically, and, abroad, henry, revived, old, dynastic, claims, to, the, french, throne, and, using, commercial, disputes, and, the, support, france, loaned, to, owain, glynd, r, as, a, casus, belli, invaded, france, in, 1415, while, not, plagued, by, constant, rebellions, as, his, father, s, reign, was, henry, v, faced, a, major, challenge, to, his, authority, on, the, eve, of, his, expedition, to, france, in, the, form, of, the, southampton, plot, this, was, led, by, sir, thomas, grey, henry, baron, scrope, and, richard, of, conisburgh, the, latter, of, whom, was, the, second, son, of, edmund, of, langley, the, 1st, duke, of, york, they, intended, to, replace, henry, with, the, young, edmund, mortimer, richard, of, conisburgh, s, brother, in, law, who, was, a, great, great, grandson, of, edward, iii, and, at, one, time, the, heir, presumptive, to, richard, ii, mortimer, remained, loyal, and, informed, henry, of, the, plot, who, had, all, three, ringleaders, executed, henry, captured, harfleur, on, 22, september, and, inflicted, a, decisive, defeat, on, the, french, at, agincourt, on, 25, october, which, wiped, out, a, significant, part, of, the, french, nobility, agincourt, and, henry, s, subsequent, campaigns, firmly, entrenched, the, legitimacy, of, the, lancastrian, monarchy, and, henry, s, pursuit, of, his, claims, on, the, french, throne, in, 1420, henry, and, charles, vi, of, france, signed, the, treaty, of, troyes, the, treaty, disinherited, the, french, dauphin, charles, from, the, line, of, succession, married, charles, daughter, catherine, of, valois, to, henry, and, acknowledged, their, future, sons, as, legitimate, successors, to, the, french, throne, richard, of, york, the, son, of, richard, of, conisburgh, was, four, years, old, when, his, father, was, executed, as, his, paternal, uncle, edward, 2nd, duke, of, york, had, died, at, agincourt, without, issue, henry, permitted, richard, of, york, to, inherit, the, title, and, lands, of, the, duchy, of, york, when, edmund, mortimer, died, childless, in, 1425, richard, of, york, also, inherited, the, earldom, of, march, and, mortimer, s, claim, to, the, throne, through, his, late, mother, edmund, mortimer, s, sister, henry, who, himself, had, three, younger, brothers, and, had, recently, married, catherine, did, not, doubt, that, the, lancastrian, claim, on, the, crown, was,

henry, v, s, younger, brothers, produced, no, surviving, legitimate, heirs, leaving, only, the, beaufort, family, as, alternative, lancastrian, successors, as, richard, of, york, grew, into, maturity, and, henry, vi, s, rule, deteriorated, york, s, claim, to, the, throne, became, more, attractive, the, revenue, from, his, estates, also, made, him, the, wealthiest, magnate, in, the, kingdom, from, early, childhood, henry, vi, was, surrounded, by, quarrelsome, councillors, and, advisors, his, younger, surviving, paternal, uncle, humphrey, duke, of, gloucester, sought, to, be, named, lord, protector, until, henry, came, of, age, and, deliberately, courted, the, popularity, of, the, common, people, for, his, own, ends, but, was, opposed, by, his, half, uncle, cardinal, henry, beaufort, on, several, occasions, beaufort, called, on, john, duke, of, bedford, gloucester, s, older, brother, and, nominal, regent, to, henry, to, return, from, his, post, as, the, king, s, commander, in, france, either, to, mediate, or, defend, him, against, gloucester, s, accusations, of, treason, overseas, the, french, had, rallied, around, joan, of, arc, and, had, inflicted, major, defeats, on, the, english, at, orl, ans, and, patay, reversing, many, of, the, gains, made, by, henry, v, and, leading, to, the, coronation, of, the, dauphin, as, charles, vii, in, reims, on, 17, july, 1429, henry, was, formally, crowned, as, henry, vi, aged, 7, shortly, thereafter, on, 6, november, in, response, to, the, coronation, of, charles, around, this, time, henry, s, mother, catherine, of, valois, had, remarried, to, owen, tudor, and, bore, two, surviving, sons, edmund, tudor, and, jasper, tudor, both, of, whom, would, play, key, roles, in, the, concluding, stages, of, the, coming, wars, henry, came, of, age, in, 1437, at, age, sixteen, however, bedford, had, died, two, years, earlier, in, 1435, and, beaufort, largely, withdrew, himself, from, public, affairs, sometime, thereafter, in, part, because, of, the, rise, to, prominence, of, his, ally, william, de, la, pole, earl, of, suffolk, as, the, dominant, personality, in, the, royal, court, like, beaufort, suffolk, favoured, a, diplomatic, rather, than, a, military, solution, to, the, deteriorating, situation, in, france, a, position, which, resonated, with, henry, who, was, by, nature, averse, to, violence, and, bloodshed, suffolk, was, opposed, by, gloucester, and, the, rising, richard, of, york, both, of, whom, favoured, a, continued, prosecution, of, a, military, solution, against, france, suffolk, and, the, beaufort, family, frequently, received, large, grants, of, money, land, and, important, government, and, military, positions, from, the, king, who, preferred, their, less, hawkish, inclinations, redirecting, much, needed, resources, away, from, richard, and, gloucester, s, campaigns, in, france, leading, to, richard, developing, a, bitter, resentment, for, the, beauforts, suffolk, continued, to, increase, his, influence, at, court, as, the, principal, architect, of, the, treaty, of, tours, in, 1444, to, broker, peace, between, england, and, france, suffolk, successfully, negotiated, the, marriage, to, henry, of, margaret, of, anjou, only, a, distant, relation, of, charles, vii, through, marriage, rather, than, blood, in, exchange, for, the, strategically, important, lands, of, maine, and, anjou, though, suffolk, earned, a, promotion, from, earl, to, marquess, and, would, be, made, a, duke, in, 1448, for, his, efforts, the, clauses, of, the, treaty, that, required, cession, of, lands, to, france, were, kept, secret, from, the, english, public, due, to, fears, of, a, significant, backlash, but, henry, insisted, on, the, treaty, two, years, later, in, 1447, suffolk, succeeded, in, having, gloucester, arrested, for, treason, gloucester, died, while, awaiting, trial, with, some, at, the, time, suspecting, that, suffolk, had, had, him, poisoned, richard, of, york, was, stripped, of, his, prestigious, command, in, france, and, sent, to, govern, the, relatively, distant, lordship, of, ireland, with, a, ten, year, term, of, office, where, he, could, not, interfere, with, affairs, at, court, during, this, time, england, continued, to, suffer, reversals, in, france, suffolk, who, was, now, the, principal, power, behind, the, throne, could, not, avoid, taking, the, blame, for, these, losses, additionally, the, blame, of, the, unfavourable, request, to, cede, maine, and, anjou, to, the, french, was, laid, at, suffolk, s, feet, though, he, continued, to, insist, he, made, no, promises, during, negotiations, to, such, a, demand, in, 1450, suffolk, was, arrested, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, london, and, impeached, in, the, commons, henry, intervened, and, instead, exiled, suffolk, for, five, years, but, en, route, to, calais, suffolk, was, captured, and, executed, on, 2, may, 1450, suffolk, was, succeeded, by, edmund, beaufort, duke, of, somerset, nephew, of, henry, beaufort, as, the, leader, of, the, faction, pursuing, peace, with, france, who, had, been, appointed, as, richard, s, replacement, as, commander, in, france, in, 1448, somerset, s, political, position, was, somewhat, fragile, as, english, military, failures, in, 1449, following, a, resumption, of, hostilities, left, him, vulnerable, to, criticism, from, richard, s, allies, at, court, somerset, had, by, this, time, become, a, close, ally, of, henry, s, wife, margaret, of, anjou, margaret, herself, wielded, almost, complete, control, over, the, pliable, king, henry, and, her, close, friendship, with, somerset, led, many, to, suspect, the, two, were, having, an, affair, indeed, upon, the, birth, of, henry, and, margaret, s, son, edward, of, westminster, in, 1453, there, were, widespread, rumours, that, somerset, was, the, father, on, 15, april, 1450, the, english, suffered, a, major, reversal, in, france, at, formigny, which, paved, the, way, for, the, french, reconquest, of, normandy, that, same, year, there, was, a, violent, popular, uprising, in, kent, which, is, often, seen, as, a, precursor, to, the, wars, of, the, roses, the, rebel, manifesto, the, complaint, of, the, poor, commons, of, kent, written, under, the, stewardship, of, rebel, leader, jack, cade, accused, the, crown, of, extortion, perversion, of, justice, and, election, fraud, the, rebels, occupied, parts, of, london, and, executed, james, fiennes, the, unpopular, lord, high, treasurer, they, dispersed, after, they, were, supposedly, pardoned, but, several, ringleaders, including, cade, were, later, executed, after, the, rebellion, the, grievances, of, cade, and, his, followers, formed, the, basis, of, richard, of, york, s, opposition, to, a, royal, government, from, which, he, felt, unduly, excluded, richard, of, york, used, the, opportunity, to, return, from, ireland, and, went, to, london, angling, himself, as, a, reformer, to, demand, better, government, he, was, eventually, imprisoned, for, much, of, 1452, and, 1453, by, the, summer, of, the, latter, year, richard, seemed, to, have, lost, the, power, struggle, throughout, these, quarrels, henry, himself, had, taken, little, part, in, proceedings, he, displayed, several, symptoms, of, mental, illness, possibly, inherited, from, his, maternal, grandfather, charles, vi, of, france, his, near, total, lack, of, leadership, in, military, matters, had, left, the, english, forces, in, france, scattered, and, weak, which, left, them, ripe, for, defeat, at, formigny, in, 1450, henry, was, described, as, more, interested, in, matters, of, religion, and, learning, which, coupled, with, his, timid, and, passive, nature, and, if, not, well, intentioned, aversion, to, warfare, made, him, an, ineffectual, king, for, the, time, on, 17, july, 1453, the, english, forces, in, southern, france, suffered, a, catastrophic, defeat, at, castillon, and, england, lost, all, her, possessions, in, france, except, for, the, pale, of, calais, shifting, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, and, ending, the, hundred, years, war, perhaps, in, reaction, to, the, news, henry, suffered, a, complete, mental, breakdown, during, which, he, failed, to, recognise, his, newborn, son, edward, on, 22, march, 1454, cardinal, john, kemp, the, lord, chancellor, died, and, henry, could, not, be, induced, to, nominate, a, successor, thus, making, government, in, the, king, s, name, constitutionally, impossible, the, lack, of, central, authority, led, to, a, continued, deterioration, of, the, unstable, political, situation, which, polarised, around, long, standing, feuds, between, the, more, powerful, noble, families, in, particular, the, percy, neville, feud, and, the, bonville, courtenay, feud, creating, a, volatile, political, climate, ripe, for, civil, war, to, ensure, the, country, could, be, governed, a, regency, council, was, established, and, despite, the, protests, of, margaret, was, led, by, richard, of, york, who, was, appointed, lord, protector, and, chief, councillor, on, 27, march, 1454, york, appointed, his, brother, in, law, richard, neville, earl, of, salisbury, to, the, post, of, chancellor, backing, the, nevilles, against, their, chief, adversary, henry, percy, earl, of, northumberland, in, backing, the, nevilles, york, gained, a, key, ally, salisbury, s, son, richard, neville, 16th, earl, of, warwick, one, of, the, wealthiest, and, most, powerful, magnates, in, the, kingdom, york, removed, somerset, from, his, position, and, imprisoned, him, in, the, tower, of, london, in, 1455, henry, made, a, surprise, recovery, from, his, mental, instability, and, reversed, much, of, richard, of, york, s, progress, somerset, was, released, and, restored, to, favour, and, york, was, forced, out, of, court, into, exile, however, disaffected, nobles, chiefly, the, earl, of, warwick, and, his, father, the, earl, of, salisbury, backed, the, claims, of, the, rival, house, of, york, to, control, of, the, government, henry, somerset, and, a, select, council, of, nobles, elected, to, hold, a, great, council, at, leicester, on, 22, may, away, from, somerset, s, enemies, in, london, fearing, that, charges, of, treason, would, be, brought, against, them, york, and, his, allies, gathered, an, army, to, intercept, the, royal, party, at, st, albans, before, they, could, reach, the, council, richard, of, york, 3rd, duke, of, york, led, a, force, of, around, 3, 000, 7, 000, troops, south, toward, london, where, they, were, met, by, henry, s, force, of, 2, 000, at, st, albans, north, of, london, on, 22, may, 1455, though, the, ensuing, struggle, resulted, in, fewer, than, 160, casualties, combined, it, was, a, decisive, yorkist, victory, king, henry, vi, had, been, taken, prisoner, by, york, s, men, who, had, found, the, monarch, hiding, in, a, local, tanner, s, shop, abandoned, by, his, courtiers, and, advisors, despite, the, paucity, of, casualties, on, either, side, many, of, york, and, the, neville, family, s, most, influential, foes, were, killed, including, edmund, beaufort, 2nd, duke, of, somerset, henry, percy, 2nd, earl, of, northumberland, and, thomas, clifford, 8th, baron, de, clifford, with, the, king, in, his, custody, and, many, of, his, key, rivals, dead, york, was, again, appointed, lord, protector, by, parliament, and, the, yorkist, faction, regained, their, position, of, influence, york, s, allies, were, soon, in, ascendancy, thanks, to, the, temporarily, stabilised, situation, particularly, the, young, richard, neville, 16th, earl, of, warwick, who, in, his, capacity, as, captain, of, calais, had, conducted, anti, piracy, operations, in, the, english, channel, warwick, rapidly, overtook, his, father, richard, neville, 5th, earl, of, salisbury, as, york, s, key, ally, protecting, york, from, retribution, in, parliament, warwick, s, position, as, commander, of, the, strategically, important, port, of, calais, also, gave, him, command, of, england, s, largest, standing, army, henry, s, consort, margaret, of, anjou, considered, warwick, a, serious, threat, to, the, throne, and, attempted, to, cut, off, his, supplies, however, a, french, attack, on, sandwich, in, august, 1457, ignited, fears, of, a, french, invasion, forcing, margaret, to, concede, and, provide, warwick, with, the, funding, he, required, to, protect, the, realm, however, in, february, 1456, henry, recovered, his, mental, faculties, and, once, again, relieved, york, of, his, office, as, lord, protector, reassuming, personal, governance, over, the, realm, despite, the, tenuous, peace, disorder, was, returning, to, the, kingdom, as, sporadic, fighting, once, more, broke, out, between, the, neville, and, percy, families, to, quell, the, growing, discontent, henry, attempted, to, broker, a, public, display, of, reconciliation, between, the, two, sides, at, st, paul, s, cathedral, on, 25, march, 1458, however, no, sooner, had, the, procession, dispersed, than, the, plotting, resumed, meanwhile, as, henry, attempted, in, vain, to, secure, peace, in, england, warwick, in, disregard, of, royal, authority, had, conducted, attacks, against, the, castilian, fleet, in, may, 1458, and, against, a, fleet, of, the, hanseatic, league, a, few, weeks, later, his, position, in, calais, also, enabled, him, to, establish, relations, with, charles, vii, of, france, and, philip, the, good, of, burgundy, international, connections, that, would, serve, him, in, the, future, in, response, to, the, attacks, warwick, was, summoned, to, london, to, face, inquiries, along, with, york, and, salisbury, however, fearing, arrest, once, they, were, isolated, from, their, allies, they, refused, york, instead, summoned, the, nevilles, to, rendezvous, at, his, stronghold, of, ludlow, castle, in, the, welsh, marches, warwick, departed, calais, with, a, portion, of, the, garrison, there, to, join, the, main, yorkist, forces, margaret, had, not, been, idle, during, this, time, and, had, been, actively, recruiting, armed, support, for, henry, distributing, a, livery, emblem, of, a, silver, swan, to, knights, and, squires, enlisted, by, her, personally, before, warwick, could, join, them, the, yorkist, army, of, 5, 000, troops, under, salisbury, was, ambushed, by, a, lancastrian, force, twice, their, size, under, james, tuchet, 5th, baron, audley, at, blore, heath, on, 23, september, 1459, the, lancastrian, army, was, defeated, and, baron, audley, himself, killed, in, the, fighting, in, september, warwick, crossed, over, into, england, and, made, his, way, north, to, ludlow, at, nearby, ludford, bridge, the, yorkist, forces, were, scattered, due, to, the, defection, of, warwick, s, calais, troops, under, andrew, trollope, forced, to, flee, york, who, was, still, lieutenant, of, ireland, left, for, dublin, with, his, second, son, edmund, earl, of, rutland, while, warwick, and, salisbury, sailed, to, calais, accompanied, by, york, s, heir, edward, earl, of, march, the, lancastrian, faction, appointed, the, new, duke, of, somerset, henry, beaufort, to, replace, warwick, in, calais, however, the, yorkists, managed, to, retain, the, loyalty, of, the, garrison, fresh, from, their, victory, at, ludford, bridge, the, lancastrian, faction, assembled, a, parliament, of, devils, at, coventry, with, the, sole, purpose, of, attainting, york, his, sons, salisbury, and, warwick, however, the, actions, of, this, assembly, caused, many, uncommitted, lords, to, fear, for, their, titles, and, property, in, march, 1460, warwick, sailed, to, ireland, under, the, protection, of, the, gascon, lord, of, duras, to, concert, plans, with, york, evading, the, royal, fleet, commanded, by, henry, holland, 3rd, duke, of, exeter, before, they, returned, to, calais, in, late, june, 1460, warwick, salisbury, and, edward, of, march, crossed, the, channel, and, rode, north, to, london, where, they, enjoyed, widespread, support, salisbury, was, left, with, a, force, to, besiege, the, tower, of, london, while, warwick, and, march, pursued, henry, northward, the, yorkists, caught, up, with, the, lancastrians, and, defeated, them, at, northampton, on, 10, july, 1460, humphrey, stafford, 1st, duke, of, buckingham, john, talbot, 2nd, earl, of, shrewsbury, john, beaumont, 1st, viscount, beaumont, and, thomas, percy, 1st, baron, egremont, were, all, killed, defending, their, king, for, a, second, time, henry, was, taken, prisoner, by, the, yorkists, who, escorted, him, to, london, compelling, the, surrender, of, the, tower, garrison, that, september, york, returned, from, ireland, and, at, the, parliament, of, october, that, year, he, made, a, symbolic, gesture, of, his, intention, to, claim, the, english, crown, by, placing, his, hand, upon, the, throne, an, act, which, shocked, the, assembly, even, york, s, closest, allies, were, not, prepared, to, support, such, a, move, assessing, york, s, claim, the, judges, felt, that, common, law, principles, could, not, determine, who, had, priority, in, the, succession, and, declared, the, matter, above, the, law, and, passed, their, learning, finding, a, lack, of, decisive, support, for, his, claim, among, the, nobility, who, at, this, stage, had, no, desire, to, usurp, henry, a, compromise, was, reached, the, act, of, accord, was, passed, on, 25, october, 1460, which, stated, that, following, henry, s, death, his, son, edward, would, be, disinherited, and, the, throne, would, pass, to, york, however, the, compromise, was, quickly, found, to, be, unpalatable, and, hostilities, resumed, queen, margaret, and, her, son, had, fled, to, lancastrian, held, harlech, castle, where, they, joined, henry, s, half, brother, jasper, tudor, and, henry, holland, 3rd, duke, of, exeter, who, were, recruiting, troops, in, wales, and, the, west, country, margaret, headed, north, to, scotland, where, she, successfully, negotiated, the, use, of, scottish, troops, and, other, aid, for, the, lancastrian, cause, from, queen, regent, mary, of, guelders, in, return, for, the, surrender, of, berwick, which, a, year, prior, james, ii, of, scotland, using, the, turmoil, of, the, war, as, an, opportunity, tried, to, retake, as, well, as, roxburgh, the, latter, though, successful, cost, him, his, life, a, similar, successful, negotiation, was, made, for, the, use, of, french, troops, and, aid, for, the, lancastrians, cause, that, same, year, this, time, in, return, for, the, surrender, of, jersey, thus, having, the, auld, alliance, backing, the, lancastrian, side, to, prevent, the, yorkist, ruled, england, from, joining, the, burgundian, state, in, its, war, with, france, a, scenario, that, neither, ally, had, the, stomach, for, the, lancastrians, rallied, in, the, north, of, england, where, the, percy, family, were, gathering, support, they, were, joined, by, somerset, and, the, thomas, courtenay, 6th, 14th, earl, of, devon, york, his, son, the, earl, of, rutland, and, salisbury, left, london, to, contain, the, lancastrian, threat, in, the,

of, suns, rising, edward, calmed, his, frightened, troops, by, convincing, them, it, represented, the, holy, trinity, and, therefore, evidence, of, divine, blessing, upon, their, cause, edward, would, later, take, the, heraldic, symbol, of, the, sunne, in, splendour, as, his, personal, device, in, the, north, having, defeated, and, killed, richard, margaret, s, troops, and, the, victorious, lancastrians, moved, south, while, warwick, with, the, captive, henry, in, tow, moved, his, forces, to, meet, them, astride, the, ancient, roman, road, of, watling, street, at, st, albans, warwick, s, forces, were, well, entrenched, but, were, ultimately, defeated, in, the, second, battle, of, st, albans, on, 17, february, henry, was, freed, by, the, lancastrians, and, knighted, his, young, son, edward, of, westminster, who, in, turn, knighted, thirty, lancastrian, leaders, warwick, and, his, troops, marched, to, rendezvous, with, the, yorkist, troops, in, the, marches, under, edward, fresh, from, their, victory, at, mortimer, s, cross, although, the, lancastrians, had, the, strategic, advantage, after, st, albans, the, lancastrian, cause, was, unpopular, in, london, and, the, citizenry, refused, entry, to, margaret, s, troops, warwick, and, edward, seizing, the, initiative, marched, rapidly, to, london, where, edward, was, proclaimed, edward, iv, of, england, by, a, hastily, gathered, assembly, edward, was, a, more, attractive, prospect, as, a, monarch, for, the, people, of, england, contemporaries, such, as, philippe, de, commines, describe, him, as, energetic, handsome, affable, and, struck, an, imposing, sight, in, full, armour, and, resplendent, clothing, a, deliberate, move, on, the, part, of, his, supporters, to, contrast, him, with, henry, whose, physical, and, mental, frailties, had, fatally, undermined, his, support, to, cement, his, position, edward, and, warwick, moved, north, to, confront, the, lancastrians, warwick, leading, the, yorkist, vanguard, inconclusively, clashed, with, the, lancastrians, at, ferrybridge, on, 28, march, at, which, warwick, was, wounded, and, the, lancastrian, commanders, the, barons, clifford, and, neville, a, distant, relative, of, warwick, were, killed, edward, engaged, the, lancastrian, s, main, army, the, following, day, on, 29, march, near, towton, yorkshire, the, battle, that, followed, was, the, largest, and, bloodiest, ever, fought, on, english, soil, and, resulted, in, a, decisive, triumph, for, edward, which, broke, the, power, of, the, lancastrians, in, the, north, the, lynchpins, of, lancastrian, control, in, the, royal, court, were, either, killed, or, fled, the, country, henry, percy, 3rd, earl, of, northumberland, was, killed, andrew, trollope, one, of, the, most, astute, lancastrian,

edward, was, the, uncontested, ruler, of, england, at, least, for, the, time, being, as, a, result, edward, used, this, opportunity, to, employ, a, bill, of, attainder, to, forfeit, the, titles, of,

defeated, the, lancastrians, under, john, butler, 6th, earl, of, ormond, forcing, the, ormonds, into, exile, and, ending, lancastrian, designs, on, ireland, that, october, margaret, of, anjou, invaded, england, with, troops, from, france, and, captured, the, castles, of, alnwick, and, bamburgh, although, they, were, back, in, yorkist, hands, within, just, three, months, in, the, spring, of, 1463, the, north, of, england, rose, in, revolt, in, support, of, henry, when, sir, ralph, percy, laid, siege, to, norham, castle, separate, truces, had, been, agreed, with, both, scotland, and, france, by, late, 1463, allowing, warwick, to, recover, much, of, the, territory, lost, in, the, north, by, 1464, the, main, lancastrian, army, moved, south, through, northumberland, however, it, was, destroyed, by, a, yorkist, force, under, john, neville, at, hexham, on, 15, may, 1464, all, three, lancastrian, commanders, henry, beaufort, 3rd, duke, of, somerset, the, baron, ros, and, the, baron, hungerford, were, captured, and, executed, yorkist, troops, captured, the, deposed, king, henry, in, the, woods, near, the, river, ribble, and, was, taken, to, london, where, he, was, imprisoned, in, the, tower, with, somerset, s, army, defeated, and, henry, captured, all, effective, resistance, to, edward, s, rule, had, been, wiped, out, edward, saw, no, profit, in, killing, henry, while, his, son, remained, alive, instead, preferring, to, keep, the, lancastrian, claim, with, a, frail, captive, margaret, and, prince, edward, were, compelled, to, leave, scotland, and, sailed, for, the, court, of, margaret, s, cousin, louis, xi, of, france, where, they, maintained, an, impoverished, court, in, exile, for, many, years, with, his, position, upon, the, throne, secure, edward, was, free, to, pursue, his, domestic, and, foreign, ambitions, internationally, edward, favoured, a, strategic, alliance, with, the, duchy, of, burgundy, but, warwick, persuaded, him, to, negotiate, a, treaty, with, louis, xi, of, france, at, the, negotiations, warwick, suggested, edward, would, be, disposed, to, a, marriage, alliance, with, the, french, crown, the, intended, bride, either, being, louis, sister, in, law, bona, of, savoy, or, his, daughter, anne, of, france, to, his, considerable, embarrassment, and, rage, warwick, discovered, in, october, 1464, that, four, months, earlier, on, 1, may, edward, had, secretly, married, elizabeth, woodville, the, widow, of, a, lancastrian, noble, elizabeth, had, twelve, siblings, some, of, whom, married, into, prominent, families, turning, the, woodvilles, into, a, powerful, political, establishment, independent, of, warwick, s, control, the, move, demonstrated, that, warwick, was, not, the, power, behind, the, throne, as, many, had, assumed, and, the, marriage, was, criticised, by, edward, s, privy, councillors, who, felt, that, marriage, to, a, woman, who, was, the, daughter, of, neither, a, duke, nor, an, earl, was, unbefitting, a, man, of, royal, blood, warwick, attempted, to, restore, his, lost, influence, by, accusing, elizabeth, and, her, mother, jacquetta, of, luxembourg, of, witchcraft, a, ploy, which, failed, but, did, not, break, the, relationship, between, warwick, and, edward, edward, s, choice, of, bride, plagued, him, politically, for, the, rest, of, his, reign, politically, it, opened, edward, up, to, accusations, that, warwick, had, been, deceiving, the, french, into, believing, the, king, was, committed, to, the, marriage, proposal, elizabeth, s, family, began, to, ascend, to, positions, of, great, importance, edward, s, father, in, law, the, earl, rivers, was, appointed, as, lord, high, treasurer, and, supported, the, king, s, position, for, a, burgundian, alliance, without, warwick, s, knowledge, edward, had, already, concluded, a, treaty, in, secret, with, burgundy, in, october, 1466, while, leaving, warwick, to, continue, with, doomed, negotiations, with, the, french, court, in, 1467, edward, removed, warwick, s, brother, the, archbishop, of, york, from, his, office, of, lord, chancellor, while, the, king, refused, to, entertain, a, marriage, proposal, between, warwick, s, eldest, daughter, isabel, and, edward, s, brother, george, plantagenet, duke, of, clarence, for, various, reasons, clarence, greatly, resented, his, brother, s, interference, in, 1468, edward, retook, jersey, from, the, french, in, april, 1469, a, rebellion, broke, out, in, yorkshire, under, a, leader, known, only, as, robin, of, redesdale, a, second, pro, lancastrian, revolt, broke, out, the, following, month, which, demanded, the, restoration, of, henry, percy, as, earl, of, northumberland, the, revolt, was, quickly, crushed, by, the, earl, john, neville, though, he, made, little, attempt, to, quell, redesdale, s, actions, warwick, and, clarence, had, spent, the, summer, assembling, troops, officially, to, suppress, the, revolt, but, in, early, july, they, travelled, to, calais, where, clarence, and, isabel, were, married, in, a, ceremony, overseen, by, warwick, they, returned, to, london, where, they, assembled, their, troops, ostensibly, to, remove, evil, councillors, from, the, king, s, company, and, re, establish, good, governance, and, moved, north, to, link, with, the, yorkshire, rebels, privately, warwick, hoped, to, depose, edward, and, install, the, nineteen, year, old, clarence, on, the, throne, redesdale, defeated, royal, troops, at, edgcote, on, 26, july, 1469, although, redesdale, was, reportedly, killed, the, two, royal, commanders, william, herbert, 1st, earl, of, pembroke, and, humphrey, stafford, 1st, earl, of, devon, were, both, captured, and, executed, elizabeth, woodville, s, father, lord, rivers, and, brother, sir, john, woodville, were, apprehended, and, murdered, after, the, battle, edward, was, taken, captive, by, george, neville, and, held, at, middleham, castle, it, soon, became, clear, to, the, rebels, that, neither, warwick, nor, clarence, enjoyed, significant, support, and, unable, to, quell, the, growing, disorder, edward, was, released, in, september, of, that, year, and, re, assumed, his, duties, as, king, in, march, 1470, warwick, and, clarence, exploited, political, instabilities, to, incite, the, 1470, lincolnshire, rebellion, hoping, to, lure, edward, north, where, he, could, be, taken, by, warwick, s, men, on, 12, march, 1470, edward, routed, the, yorkist, rebels, at, the, battle, of, losecoat, field, and, captured, the, rebel, leader, the, baron, willoughby, who, named, warwick, and, clarence, as, the, partners, and, chief, provokers, of, the, rebellion, physical, evidence, also, came, to, light, which, proved, the, complicity, of, the, two, men, who, fled, to, france, in, may, willoughby, was, beheaded, and, his, lands, seized, seeking, to, capitalise, on, warwick, s, disfavour, with, the, king, louis, xi, of, france, arranged, a, reconciliation, between, warwick, and, his, bitter, rival, margaret, of, anjou, with, the, objective, to, restore, henry, to, the, throne, as, part, of, the, arrangement, warwick, agreed, to, marry, his, daughter, anne, to, edward, of, westminster, margaret, and, henry, s, son, and, heir, apparent, while, the, marriage, was, solemnised, it, may, not, have, been, consummated, as, margaret, was, hoping, to, find, a, better, match, for, her, son, once, he, became, king, staging, a, diversionary, uprising, in, the, north, warwick, and, clarence, launched, a, two, pronged, invasion, of, england, at, dartmouth, and, plymouth, on, 13, september, 1470, warwick, s, brother, the, marquess, of, montagu, joined, him, bitter, with, the, king, that, his, support, for, the, crown, during, the, preceding, revolts, did, not, result, in, the, restoration, of, his, earldom, edward, rushed, south, to, meet, the, invasion, while, montagu, s, forces, advanced, from, the, north, and, the, king, found, himself, surrounded, with, few, options, edward, his, younger, brother, richard, duke, of, gloucester, and, several, hundred, retainers, fled, to, flanders, on, 2, october, then, part, of, the, duchy, of, burgundy, his, ally, the, readeption, of, henry, vi, restored, him, as, king, a, throne, which, warwick, was, now, indisputably, in, effective, control, of, in, november, edward, was, attainted, and, his, brother, clarence, was, awarded, the, title, of, duke, of, york, burgundy, was, ruled, by, charles, the, bold, husband, of, edward, s, sister, margaret, charles, rendered, precious, little, assistance, to, his, brother, in, law, something, edward, would, never, forget, however, unfortunately, for, warwick, and, clarence, henry, s, new, regime, was, precariously, unstable, edmund, beaufort, 4th, duke, of, somerset, held, warwick, responsible, for, his, father, s, death, in, 1455, and, the, ensuing, internal, disputes, eventually, left, warwick, and, clarence, politically, isolated, with, the, backing, of, flemish, merchants, edward, landed, at, ravenspurn, in, yorkshire, on, 14, march, 1471, supported, by, the, earl, of, northumberland, edward, was, joined, by, troops, under, sir, william, parr, and, sir, james, harrington, a, move, which, convinced, clarence, who, was, politically, disadvantaged, by, his, agreement, with, the, lancastrians, to, abandon, warwick, and, henry, and, join, his, brother, edward, s, army, made, rapidly, for, london, where, they, took, the, by, now, feeble, king, henry, prisoner, and, sent, him, to, the, tower, of, london, poor, weather, contained, french, troops, under, margaret, and, edward, of, westminster, on, the, continent, preventing, warwick, from, being, reinforced, despite, this, and, clarence, s, defection, warwick, marched, in, pursuit, of, edward, s, growing, army, and, the, two, sides, met, in, battle, at, barnet, on, 14, april, 1471, poor, visibility, due, to, thick, mist, and, the, similarity, of, edward, s, heraldic, sun, to, the, earl, of, oxford, s, star, led, to, the, lancastrians, attacking, their, own, men, and, coupled, with, edward, s, determined, attack, warwick, s, army, was, destroyed, during, the, rout, warwick, was, unhorsed, and, killed, along, with, his, brother, the, john, neville, 1st, marquess, of, montagu, while, henry, holland, 3rd, duke, of, exeter, was, apprehended, and, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, london, in, 1475, exeter, would, be, sent, on, a, yorkist, expedition, to, france, where, he, was, reputed, to, have, fallen, overboard, while, at, sea, and, drowned, without, any, witnesses, warwick, s, defeat, and, death, was, a, catastrophic, blow, for, the, lancastrian, cause, and, the, neville, family, s, political, influence, was, irrevocably, broken, the, return, of, henry, vi, to, the, throne, did, not, last, long, though, the, nevilles, had, been, defeated, on, the, same, day, of, the, clash, at, barnet, margaret, had, managed, to, land, her, forces, at, weymouth, and, augmented, her, army, with, recruits, from, the, welsh, marches, despite, the, heavy, defeat, they, had, suffered, at, barnet, survivors, from, the, battle, rallied, around, the, lancastrian, queen, edward, moved, to, intercept, the, lancastrian, army, realising, they, are, attempting, to, cross, the, river, severn, into, wales, acting, upon, correspondence, sent, by, henry, vi, sir, richard, beauchamp, governor, of, gloucester, barred, the, gates, to, margaret, s, troops, preventing, the, lancastrians, from, crossing, in, time, on, 4, may, 1471, edward, intercepted, and, engaged, margaret, s, army, at, tewkesbury, defeating, it, henry, vi, and, margaret, s, only, son, edward, of, westminster, was, killed, by, clarence, s, men, while, the, duke, of, somerset, and, john, courtenay, 15th, earl, of, devon, were, both, killed, the, royal, propagandist, of, the, historie, of, the, arrivall, of, edward, iv, suggests, the, royal, army, was, though, small, well, armed, and, determined, and, that, edward, claimed, he, had, returned, solely, for, his, duchy, of, york, however, henry, vi, could, not, start, raising, a, force, of, any, numbers, until, well, to, the, south, of, england, in, lord, hastings, s, estates, in, the, midlands, about, 3, 000, men, in, nottingham, where, he, was, joined, by, william, parr, and, james, harrington, with, their, personal, forces, of, sixty, men, at, arms, whereas, in, the, north, came, not, so, many, as, supposed, would, have, come, reported, the, arrivalist, edward, iv, entered, london, on, 21, may, henry, vi, died, that, night, or, soon, afterwards, perhaps, on, edward, s, orders, a, contemporary, chronicle, favourable, to, edward, iv, reported, henry, s, death, as, caused, by, melancholy, after, hearing, of, his, son, s, death, it, is, widely, suspected, however, that, with, henry, s, only, heir, dead, edward, had, ordered, the, former, king, s, murder, margaret, of, anjou, was, imprisoned, until, she, was, ransomed, by, louis, xi, in, 1475, to, france, where, she, would, live, for, the, remainder, of, her, life, dying, on, 25, august, 1482, with, the, defeats, at, barnet, and, tewkesbury, armed, lancastrian, resistance, appeared, to, be, at, an, end, however, edward, iv, s, regime, was, progressively, fractured, by, a, worsening, feud, between, his, brothers, george, plantagenet, duke, of, clarence, and, richard, duke, of, gloucester, on, 22, december, 1476, clarence, s, wife, isabel, died, clarence, accused, one, of, the, late, isabel, s, ladies, in, waiting, ankarette, twynyho, of, having, murdered, her, and, in, turn, clarence, murdered, her, ankarette, s, grandson, received, a, retrospective, pardon, for, ankarette, from, edward, in, 1478, illustrating, the, quasi, monarchical, attitude, of, clarence, which, edward, was, growing, wary, of, in, 1477, clarence, was, proposed, as, a, suitor, for, mary, who, had, just, become, duchess, of, burgundy, but, edward, objected, to, the, match, and, clarence, left, the, royal, court, for, his, part, gloucester, was, married, to, anne, neville, both, anne, and, isabel, were, daughters, of, the, countess, of, warwick, and, therefore, heirs, to, their, mother, s, considerable, fortune, many, of, the, estates, held, by, the, two, brothers, had, been, bestowed, upon, them, by, edward, s, patronage, who, retained, the, right, to, revoke, them, this, was, not, the, case, with, property, acquired, through, marriage, this, difference, fuelled, the, disagreement, clarence, continued, to, fall, out, of, favour, with, edward, persistently, widespread, claims, he, was, involved, in, a, revolt, against, edward, led, to, his, imprisonment, and, execution, at, the, tower, of, london, on, 18, february, 1478, edward, s, reign, was, relatively, peaceful, domestically, in, 1475, he, invaded, france, however, he, signed, the, treaty, of, picquigny, with, louis, xi, whereby, edward, withdrew, after, receiving, an, initial, payment, of, 75, 000, crowns, plus, an, annual, pension, of, 50, 000, crowns, while, in, 1482, he, attempted, to, usurp, the, scottish, throne, but, was, ultimately, compelled, to, withdraw, back, to, england, nevertheless, they, were, successful, in, retaking, berwick, in, 1483, edward, s, health, began, to, fail, and, he, fell, fatally, ill, that, easter, prior, to, his, death, he, named, his, brother, richard, to, act, as, lord, protector, for, his, twelve, year, old, son, and, successor, edward, on, 9, april, 1483, edward, iv, died, richard, iii, 2, october, 1452, 22, august, 1485, was, king, of, england, and, lord, of, ireland, from, 26, june, 1483, until, his, death, in, 1485, he, was, the, last, king, of, the, house, of, york, and, the, last, of, the, plantagenet, dynasty, his, defeat, and, death, at, the, battle, of, bosworth, field, the, last, battle, of, the, wars, of, the, roses, marked, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, in, england, richard, was, created, duke, of, gloucester, in, 1461, after, the, accession, of, his, brother, king, edward, iv, in, 1472, he, married, anne, neville, daughter, of, richard, neville, 16th, earl, of, warwick, he, governed, northern, england, during, edward, s, reign, and, played, a, role, in, the, invasion, of, scotland, in, 1482, when, edward, iv, died, in, april, 1483, richard, was, named, lord, protector, of, the, realm, for, edward, s, eldest, son, and, successor, the, 12, year, old, edward, v, arrangements, were, made, for, edward, v, s, coronation, on, 22, june, 1483, before, the, king, could, be, crowned, the, marriage, of, his, parents, was, declared, bigamous, and, therefore, invalid, officially, illegitimate, their, children, were, barred, from, inheriting, the, throne, on, 25, june, an, assembly, of, lords, and, commoners, endorsed, a, declaration, to, this, effect, and, proclaimed, richard, as, the, rightful, king, he, was, crowned, on, 6, july, 1483, edward, and, his, younger, brother, richard, of, shrewsbury, duke, of, york, called, the, princes, in, the, tower, were, not, seen, in, public, after, august, and, accusations, circulated, that, they, had, been, murdered, on, king, richard, s, orders, after, the, tudor, dynasty, established, their, rule, a, few, years, later, there, were, two, big, rebellions, against, richard, during, his, reign, in, october, 1483, an, revolt, was, led, by, staunch, allies, of, edward, iv, and, richard, s, former, ally, henry, stafford, 2nd, duke, of, buckingham, then, in, august, 1485, henry, tudor, and, his, uncle, jasper, tudor, landed, in, southern, wales, with, a, contingent, of, french, troops, and, marched, through, pembrokeshire, recruiting, soldiers, henry, s, forces, defeated, richard, s, army, near, the, leicestershire, town, of, market, bosworth, richard, was, slain, making, him, the, last, english, king, to, die, in, battle, henry, tudor, ascended, the, throne, as, henry, vii, during, edward, iv, s, reign, his, brother, richard, duke, of, gloucester, had, risen, to, become, the, most, powerful, magnate, in, the, north, of, england, particularly, in, the, city, of, york, where, his, popularity, was, high, prior, to, his, death, the, king, had, named, richard, as, lord, protector, to, act, as, regent, to, his, twelve, year, old, son, edward, v, richard, s, allies, particularly, henry, stafford, duke, of, buckingham, and, the, powerful, and, wealthy, baron, william, hastings, the, lord, chamberlain, urged, richard, to, bring, a, strong, force, to, london, to, counter, any, move, the, woodville, family, might, make, richard, departed, yorkshire, for, london, where, he, intended, to, meet, the, young, king, at, northampton, and, travel, to, london, together, following, edward, iv, s, death, the, dowager, queen, elizabeth, instructed, her, brother, anthony, woodville, earl, rivers, to, escort, her, son, edward, v, to, london, with, an, armed, escort, of, 2, 000, men, however, upon, reaching, northampton, richard, discovered, that, the, king, had, already, been, sent, onward, to, stony, stratford, in, buckinghamshire, in, response, and, to, forestall, any, woodville, family, attempts, on, his, person, on, 30, april, 1483, richard, had, earl, rivers, edward, s, half, brother, richard, grey, and, edward, s, chamberlain, thomas, vaughan, arrested, and, sent, to, the, north, richard, and, edward, journeyed, to, london, together, where, the, young, king, took, up, residence, at, the, tower, of, london, on, 19, may, 1483, joined, the, following, month, by, his, younger, brother, richard, of, shrewsbury, duke, of, york, despite, his, assurances, to, the, contrary, richard, had, earl, rivers, grey, and, vaughan, beheaded, in, june, 1483, acting, as, lord, protector, richard, repeatedly, stalled, the, coronation, of, edward, v, despite, the, urging, of, the, king, s, councillors, who, wished, to, avoid, another, protectorate, that, same, month, richard, accused, the, lord, chamberlain, the, baron, hastings, of, treason, and, had, him, executed, without, trial, on, 13, june, hastings, had, been, popular, and, his, death, created, considerable, controversy, not, least, because, his, loyalty, to, edward, and, his, continued, presence, would, have, presented, a, major, obstacle, to, richard, s, path, to, securing, the, throne, a, clergyman, likely, robert, stillington, the, bishop, of, bath, and, wells, informed, richard, that, edward, iv, s, marriage, to, elizabeth, woodville, was, invalid, because, of, edward, s, earlier, union, to, eleanor, butler, thereby, making, edward, v, and, his, siblings, illegitimate, heirs, to, the, throne, on, 22, june, the, selected, date, for, edward, s, coronation, a, sermon, was, preached, outside, st, paul, s, cathedral, declaring, richard, the, rightful, king, a, post, which, the, citizenry, petitioned, richard, to, accept, richard, accepted, four, days, later, and, was, crowned, at, westminster, abbey, on, 6, july, 1483, edward, and, his, brother, richard, of, shrewsbury, who, were, still, in, residence, in, the, tower, of, london, had, completely, disappeared, by, the, summer, of, 1483, the, fate, of, the, two, princes, following, their, disappearance, remains, a, mystery, to, this, day, however, the, most, widely, accepted, explanation, is, that, they, were, murdered, on, the, orders, of, richard, iii, stripped, of, her, family, s, influence, at, court, the, widowed, elizabeth, woodville, along, with, richard, s, disaffected, former, ally, henry, stafford, 2nd, duke, of, buckingham, allied, themselves, with, lady, margaret, beaufort, who, began, to, actively, promote, her, son, henry, tudor, a, great, great, great, grandson, of, edward, iii, and, the, closest, male, heir, of, the, lancastrian, claim, as, an, alternative, to, richard, woodville, proposed, to, strengthen, henry, s, claim, by, marrying, him, to, her, daughter, elizabeth, of, york, the, only, living, heir, to, edward, iv, convinced, of, the, need, for, yorkist, support, henry, promised, his, hand, to, elizabeth, well, before, his, planned, invasion, of, england, a, factor, which, caused, many, yorkists, to, abandon, richard, by, september, 1483, a, conspiracy, against, richard, began, to, be, formulated, among, members, of, the, disaffected, english, gentry, many, of, whom, had, been, staunch, supporters, of, edward, iv, and, his, heirs, since, edward, iv, had, regained, the, throne, in, 1471, henry, tudor, had, lived, in, exile, at, the, court, of, francis, ii, duke, of, brittany, henry, was, half, guest, half, prisoner, since, francis, regarded, henry, his, family, and, his, courtiers, as, valuable, bargaining, tools, to, barter, for, the, aid, of, england, particularly, in, conflicts, with, france, and, therefore, shielded, the, exiled, lancastrians, well, repeatedly, refusing, to, surrender, them, henry, in, particular, was, supported, by, the, breton, treasurer, pierre, landais, who, hoped, that, an, overthrow, of, richard, would, cement, a, joint, anglo, breton, alliance, now, in, alliance, with, richard, s, former, supporter, henry, stafford, 2nd, duke, of, buckingham, francis, provided, henry, with, 40, 000, gold, crowns, 15, 000, troops, and, a, fleet, of, ships, to, invade, england, however, henry, s, forces, were, scattered, by, a, storm, compelling, henry, to, abandon, the, invasion, nevertheless, buckingham, had, already, launched, a, revolt, against, richard, on, 18, october, 1483, with, the, aim, of, installing, henry, as, king, buckingham, raised, a, substantial, number, of, troops, from, his, welsh, estates, and, planned, to, join, his, brother, the, earl, of, devon, however, without, henry, s, troops, richard, easily, defeated, buckingham, s, rebellion, and, the, defeated, duke, was, captured, convicted, of, treason, and, executed, in, salisbury, on, 2, november, 1483, following, the, rebellion, in, january, 1484, richard, stripped, elizabeth, woodville, of, all, the, lands, bestowed, upon, her, during, her, late, husband, s, reign, for, the, sake, of, outward, appearances, the, two, appeared, to, reconcile, following, buckingham, s, failed, revolt, some, 500, englishmen, fled, to, rennes, the, capital, of, brittany, to, join, henry, in, exile, richard, opened, negotiations, with, francis, for, henry, s, extradition, to, england, however, the, duke, continued, to, refuse, hoping, for, the, possibility, of, extracting, more, generous, concessions, from, richard, in, exchange, by, mid, 1484, francis, was, incapacitated, from, illness, leaving, landais, to, take, the, reins, of, government, richard, made, overtures, to, landais, offering, military, support, to, defend, brittany, against, a, possible, french, attack, landais, agreed, however, henry, escaped, to, france, by, mere, hours, henry, was, warmly, received, at, the, court, of, charles, viii, of, france, who, supplied, henry, with, resources, for, his, coming, invasion, upon, the, recovery, of, francis, ii, charles, offered, the, remaining, lancastrians, in, brittany, safe, conduct, to, france, paying, for, their, expenses, himself, for, charles, henry, and, his, supporters, were, useful, political, pawns, to, ensure, richard, did, not, intervene, with, french, designs, on, the, acquisition, of, brittany, on, 16, march, 1485, richard, s, wife, anne, neville, died, rumours, quickly, spread, that, she, had, been, murdered, to, allow, richard, to, marry, his, niece, elizabeth, of, york, rumours, which, alienated, richard, s, northern, supporters, richard, s, marriage, to, elizabeth, had, the, potential, of, unravelling, the, tudor, plans, and, split, the, yorkists, who, supported, henry, from, their, cause, henry, secured, the, patronage, of, the, french, regent, anne, of, beaujeu, who, supplied, him, with, 2, 000, troops, in, support, overseas, henry, relied, heavily, on, his, mother, margaret, of, beaufort, to, raise, troops, and, support, for, him, in, england, anxious, to, press, his, claim, with, the, backing, of, the, woodvilles, henry, set, sail, from, france, on, 1, august, with, a, force, consisting, of, his, english, and, welsh, exiles, along, with, a, large, contingent, of, french, and, scottish, troops, landing, near, dale, pembrokeshire, in, wales, henry, s, return, to, his, welsh, homeland, was, regarded, by, some, as, the, fulfilment, of, a, messianic, prophecy, as, the, youth, of, brittany, defeating, the, saxons, and, restore, their, country, to, glory, henry, amassed, an, army, of, approximately, 5, 000, troops, to, confront, richard, richard, s, lieutenant, in, wales, sir, walter, herbert, failed, to, move, against, henry, and, two, of, his, officers, deserted, to, the, tudor, claimant, with, their, troops, richard, s, lieutenant, in, west, wales, rhys, ap, thomas, also, defected, by, mid, august, henry, crossed, the, english, border, advancing, on, shrewsbury, richard, who, had, been, well, informed, of, henry, s, movements, had, ordered, a, mobilisation, of, his, troops, the, powerful, stanleys, had, assembled, their, bannermen, upon, hearing, of, henry, s, landing, while, they, had, been, communicating, on, friendly, terms, with, henry, both, prior, to, and, during, his, landfall, in, england, their, forces, were, a, wildcard, and, would, not, support, henry, until, a, decisive, juncture, in, the, coming, battle, on, 22, august, 1485, henry, tudor, s, outnumbered, forces, engaged, richard, s, army, in, the, battle, of, bosworth, field, stanley, s, forces, entered, the, fray, on, behalf, of, henry, decisively, defeating, richard, s, army, polydore, vergil, henry, s, official, historian, records, that, king, richard, alone, was, killed, fighting, manfully, in, the, thickest, press, of, his, enemies, and, became, the, last, english, king, to, die, in, battle, richard, s, ally, the, earl, of, northumberland, fled, while, the, duke, of, norfolk, was, killed, and, thomas, howard, earl, of, surrey, was, taken, captive, henry, claimed, the, throne, by, right, of, conquest, retroactively, dating, his, claim, to, the, day, prior, to, richard, s, defeat, henry, was, crowned, as, henry, vii, of, england, on, 30, october, 1485, in, westminster, abbey, as, per, his, pledge, henry, married, elizabeth, of, york, on, 18, january, 1486, and, elizabeth, gave, birth, to, their, first, child, just, 8, months, later, prince, arthur, the, couple, s, marriage, appears, to, have, been, a, happy, one, henry, in, particular, was, noted, for, being, uncharacteristically, faithful, for, a, king, of, the, time, henry, and, elizabeth, s, marriage, united, the, rival, lancastrian, and, yorkist, claims, since, their, children, would, inherit, the, claims, of, both, dynasties, however, paranoia, persisted, that, anyone, with, blood, ties, to, the, plantagenets, were, secretly, coveting, the, throne, despite, the, union, of, the, two, dynasties, henry, s, position, as, king, was, not, immediately, secure, that, same, year, he, faced, a, rebellion, of, the, stafford, brothers, aided, and, abetted, by, viscount, lovell, but, the, revolt, collapsed, without, any, open, fighting, the, stafford, brothers, claimed, sanctuary, at, a, church, belonging, to, abingdon, abbey, in, culham, however, henry, had, the, staffords, forcibly, removed, by, the, knight, sir, john, savage, on, 14, may, and, tried, before, the, court, of, the, king, s, bench, which, ruled, that, sanctuary, was, inapplicable, in, matters, of, treason, protests, over, henry, s, actions, were, lodged, with, pope, innocent, viii, which, resulted, in, a, papal, bull, that, agreed, to, some, modifications, over, the, right, of, sanctuary, henry, also, dealt, with, other, potential, threats, to, his, reign, the, heir, to, the, male, line, yorkist, claim, was, edward, earl, of, warwick, the, ten, year, old, son, of, edward, iv, s, brother, george, duke, of, clarence, henry, had, warwick, arrested, and, imprisoned, at, the, tower, of, london, around, this, time, a, yorkist, sympathising, priest, by, the, name, of, richard, symonds, had, noticed, a, striking, similarity, between, a, young, boy, lambert, simnel, and, richard, of, shrewsbury, one, of, the, princes, in, the, tower, and, began, tutoring, the, boy, in, the, manners, of, the, royal, court, perhaps, hoping, to, put, forth, simnel, as, an, impostor, prince, richard, the, rumour, spread, that, edward, iv, s, children, were, still, alive, however, the, false, report, of, the, death, of, the, imprisoned, earl, of, warwick, changed, the, impersonation, who, was, roughly, the, same, age, as, simnel, john, de, la, pole, 1st, earl, of, lincoln, who, himself, had, a, claim, on, the, throne, as, a, plantagenet, descendant, and, richard, iii, s, nephew, left, the, royal, court, on, 19, march, 1487, for, burgundy, to, capitalise, on, the, rumours, his, aunt, margaret, duchess, of, burgundy, provided, him, with, financial, and, military, support, the, yorkist, exiles, sailed, for, ireland, where, the, yorkist, cause, was, popular, to, gather, support, simnel, was, proclaimed, king, edward, vi, in, dublin, despite, henry, s, efforts, to, quell, the, rumours, which, included, parading, the, real, earl, of, warwick, through, the, streets, of, london, while, nominally, supporting, the, impostor, king, lincoln, likely, saw, the, whole, affair, as, an, opportunity, to, claim, the, throne, for, himself, lincoln, had, no, intention, of, remaining, in, ireland, and, with, simnel, 2, 000, german, mercenaries, and, an, additional, large, host, of, irish, troops, landed, on, piel, island, in, lancashire, and, proceeded, to, march, on, york, though, the, yorkist, march, avoided, henry, s, main, army, they, were, repeatedly, harassed, by, tudor, cavalry, under, sir, edward, woodville, while, henry, s, army, was, outnumbered, they, were, far, better, equipped, than, the, yorkists, and, henry, s, two, principal, commanders, jasper, tudor, and, john, de, vere, 13th, earl, of, oxford, were, more, experienced, than, any, of, the, yorkist, leaders, the, two, armies, met, in, battle, at, stoke, field, on, 16, june, 1487, and, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, the, yorkist, force, the, earl, of, lincoln, was, killed, in, the, fighting, while, the, viscount, lovell, disappeared, likely, to, scotland, henry, pardoned, the, young, simnel, likely, recognising, he, was, merely, a, puppet, in, the, hands, of, adults, and, put, him, to, work, in, the, royal, kitchens, as, a, spit, turner, simnel, later, became, a, falconer, and, died, around, 1534, henry, persuaded, the, pope, to, excommunicate, the, irish, clergy, who, supported, the, revolt, and, had, symonds, imprisoned, but, not, executed, stoke, field, proved, to, be, the, last, military, engagement, of, the, wars, of, the, roses, in, 1491, perkin, warbeck, a, young, man, hired, in, the, service, of, a, breton, merchant, was, regarded, favourably, as, an, inheritor, of, the, yorkist, claim, to, the, throne, by, the, pro, york, citizens, of, cork, in, ireland, who, allegedly, decided, to, put, warbeck, forth, as, an, impostor, richard, of, shrewsbury, warbeck, first, claimed, the, throne, at, the, burgundian, court, in, 1490, claiming, to, indeed, be, richard, and, that, he, had, been, spared, due, to, his, young, age, he, was, publicly, recognised, as, richard, by, margaret, of, york, sister, of, edward, iv, and, was, recognised, as, richard, iv, of, england, at, the, funeral, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, frederick, iii, and, had, become, recognised, as, the, duke, of, york, in, international, diplomacy, despite, henry, s, protests, some, nobles, in, england, were, prepared, to, recognise, warbeck, as, richard, including, sir, simon, montfort, sir, william, stanley, sir, thomas, thwaites, and, sir, robert, clifford, clifford, who, visited, warbeck, wrote, back, to, his, allies, in, england, confirming, warbeck, s, identity, as, the, lost, prince, in, january, 1495, henry, crushed, the, conspiracy, with, six, of, the, conspirators, imprisoned, and, fined, while, montfort, stanley, and, several, others, were, executed, warbeck, courted, the, scottish, royal, court, where, he, was, well, received, by, james, iv, who, hoped, to, use, warbeck, as, leverage, in, international, diplomacy, in, september, 1496, james, invaded, england, with, warbeck, however, the, army, was, forced, to, withdraw, when, it, expended, its, supplies, and, support, for, warbeck, in, the, north, failed, to, materialise, having, now, fallen, out, of, favour, with, james, perkin, sailed, to, waterford, on, 7, september, 1497, warbeck, landed, in, cornwall, hoping, to, capitalise, on, the, cornish, people, s, resentment, to, henry, vii, s, unpopular, taxes, which, had, induced, them, into, revolt, just, three, months, earlier, warbeck, s, presence, triggered, a, second, revolt, he, was, declared, as, richard, iv, on, bodmin, moor, and, his, army, of, 6, 000, cornishmen, advanced, on, taunton, however, when, warbeck, received, word, the, king, s, troops, were, in, the, area, he, panicked, and, deserted, his, army, warbeck, was, captured, imprisoned, and, on, 23, november, 1499, he, was, hanged, that, same, year, henry, had, the, captive, edward, plantagenet, 17th, earl, of, warwick, who, had, shared, a, cell, with, warbeck, and, made, an, escape, attempt, together, executed, with, warwick, s, death, the, direct, male, line, descent, of, the, plantagenet, dynasty, was, rendered, extinct, some, historians, question, the, impact, the, wars, had, on, the, fabric, of, english, society, and, culture, revisionists, such, as, the, oxford, historian, k, b, mcfarlane, suggests, that, the, effects, of, the, conflict, were, greatly, exaggerated, many, parts, of, england, were, largely, unaffected, by, the, wars, particularly, east, anglia, in, the, densely, populated, regions, of, the, country, both, factions, had, far, more, to, lose, by, the, ruin, of, the, country, through, protracted, sieges, and, pillaging, and, sought, a, quick, resolution, to, the, conflict, through, a, pitched, battle, the, lengthy, sieges, that, did, occur, such, as, at, harlech, and, bamburgh, were, in, comparatively, remote, and, sparsely, populated, areas, contemporaries, such, as, philippe, de, commines, observed, in, 1470, that, england, was, a, unique, case, compared, to, wars, that, befell, the, continent, in, that, the, consequences, of, war, were, only, visited, upon, soldiers, and, nobles, not, citizens, and, private, property, the, instability, caused, by, the, wars, of, the, roses, allowed, nobles, to, take, advantage, and, promote, their, own, position, at, the, expense, of, others, this, was, because, the, 15th, century, ce, witnessed, the, phenomenon, of, bastard, feudalism, which, involved, the, partial, degradation, of, medieval, feudalism, rich, landowners, were, able, to, possess, private, armies, of, retainers, accumulate, wealth, and, diminish, the, power, of, the, crown, at, a, local, level, many, areas, undertook, little, effort, to, improve, their, defences, city, walls, were, either, left, in, prior, ruinous, states, or, only, partially, rebuilt, as, was, the, case, in, london, whereby, the, citizenry, was, able, to, avoid, devastation, by, persuading, the, yorkist, and, lancastrian, troops, to, stay, out, after, the, inability, to, reconstruct, adequate, walls, thereby, rendering, the, city, indefensible, it, is, true, that, the, wars, were, largely, fought, between, nobles, and, their, private, armies, and, they, were, also, intermittent, with, fewer, than, 24, months, of, actual, fighting, over, the, entire, period, nevertheless, the, local, populace, was, sometimes, dragged, into, the, conflict, especially, if, nobles, formed, militia, from, their, estate, workers, among, the, lords, few, noble, houses, were, extinguished, entirely, by, the, wars, between, 1425, and, 1449, before, the, outbreak, of, fighting, there, were, as, many, extinctions, of, noble, lines, from, natural, causes, 25, as, occurred, between, 1450, and, 1474, 24, during, the, heaviest, period, of, combat, however, several, preeminent, noble, families, had, their, power, crippled, because, of, the, fighting, such, as, the, neville, family, while, the, direct, male, line, of, the, plantagenet, dynasty, was, rendered, extinct, nevertheless, every, subsequent, monarch, of, england, and, its, successor, states, has, been, a, direct, descendant, of, edward, iii, of, england, through, three, of, his, sons, but, through, the, female, line, the, reign, of, the, monarchy, was, broken, briefly, only, by, cromwell, s, commonwealth, of, england, and, the, protectorate, despite, the, relative, paucity, of, violence, undertaken, against, civilians, the, wars, claimed, the, lives, of, 105, 000, people, approximately, 5, 5, per, cent, of, the, population, in, 1450, by, 1490, england, had, experienced, a, 12, 6, per, cent, increase, in, population, compared, to, 1450, despite, the, wars, although, there, would, be, no, more, serious, military, threat, to, henry, s, rule, or, the, tudor, claim, to, the, throne, that, threatened, a, repeat, of, the, wars, of, the, roses, individuals, claiming, descent, from, the, plantagenets, continued, to, present, challenges, to, the, tudor, dynasty, when, henry, ascended, the, throne, there, were, eighteen, plantagenet, descendants, who, may, be, considered, to, have, a, stronger, claim, to, the, throne, and, by, 1510, this, number, had, increased, by, the, birth, of, sixteen, yorkist, children, the, de, la, pole, family, continued, to, lay, claim, to, the, throne, edmund, de, la, pole, 3rd, duke, of, suffolk, brother, of, the, executed, earl, of, lincoln, was, executed, in, 1513, by, henry, viii, for, this, claim, while, his, brother, richard, known, as, the, white, rose, and, who, had, conspired, to, invade, england, to, claim, the, throne, was, killed, in, battle, at, pavia, in, 1525, as, late, as, 1600, before, the, death, of, elizabeth, i, there, were, twelve, competitors, for, succession, which, included, seven, plantagenet, descendants, the, tudor, dynasty, s, tenuous, claim, to, the, throne, and, the, potentially, stronger, claims, of, plantagenet, inheritors, was, a, significant, factor, in, driving, henry, viii, s, considerable, anxiety, over, the, need, to, produce, a, male, heir, henry, was, well, aware, of, the, potential, instability, that, could, follow, a, succession, crisis, and, wished, to, avoid, a, repeat, of, the, wars, of, the, roses, the, english, monarchy, prior, to, the, wars, exerted, only, weak, influence, unable, to, prevent, the, growing, factional, rivalries, that, undermined, the, political, structure, of, the, country, when, henry, vii, ascended, the, throne, he, inherited, a, government, that, had, been, significantly, weakened, although, the, tudor, claim, on, the, throne, was, weak, and, the, new, regime, faced, several, rebellions, henry, s, rule, provided, much, needed, stability, to, the, realm, that, prevented, further, outbreaks, of, war, trade, commerce, and, culture, flourished, and, war, would, not, return, to, england, for, 155, years, upon, his, death, henry, vii, had, left, to, his, successors, a, thriving, economy, in, part, thanks, to, his, frugal, spending, slavin, 1964, considers, henry, vii, to, be, a, member, of, the, new, monarchs, defined, as, a, ruler, who, centralised, power, in, the, monarchy, and, unified, their, nation, though, the, monarchy, saw, a, strengthening, under, the, tudors, they, generally, operated, within, the, established, legal, and, financial, boundaries, which, compelled, the, monarch, to, cooperate, closely, with, the, nobility, rather, than, against, them, tudor, monarchs, particularly, henry, viii, defined, the, concept, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, to, help, reinforce, monarchical, authority, a, philosophical, concept, which, would, come, to, plague, england, under, the, reign, of, charles, i, leading, to, the, english, civil, war, the, ascension, of, the, tudor, dynasty, saw, the, end, of, the, dawn, of, the, english, renaissance, an, offshoot, of, the, italian, renaissance, that, saw, a, revolution, in, art, literature, music, and, architecture, the, english, reformation, england, s, break, with, the, roman, catholic, church, occurred, under, the, tudors, which, saw, the, establishment, of, the, anglican, church, and, the, rise, of, protestantism, as, england, s, dominant, religious, denomination, henry, viii, s, need, for, a, male, heir, impelled, by, the, potential, for, a, crisis, of, succession, that, dominated, the, wars, of, the, roses, was, the, prime, motivator, influencing, his, decision, to, separate, england, from, rome, the, reign, of, henry, viii, s, daughter, elizabeth, i, is, considered, by, historians, to, be, a, golden, age, in, english, history, and, is, widely, remembered, today, as, the, elizabethan, era, historian, john, guy, argued, that, england, was, economically, healthier, more, expansive, and, more, optimistic, under, the, tudors, than, at, any, time, since, the, roman, occupation, historians, such, as, kendall, walpole, and, buck, contend, that, the, characterisation, of, the, wars, of, the, roses, as, a, period, of, bloodshed, and, lawlessness, contrasted, with, the, tudors, ushering, in, a, period, of, law, peace, and, prosperity, served, the, political, interests, of, the, tudors, to, present, the, new, regime, positively, contemporaries, of, the, tudors, such, as, william, shakespeare, and, sir, thomas, more, wrote, fictional, and, non, fictional, works, respectively, which, were, hostile, to, the, yorkists, particularly, richard, iii, horspool, observes, that, more, s, work, which, likely, influenced, shakespeare, was, a, private, endeavour, published, only, after, his, death, as, opposed, to, a, state, sponsored, commission, military, strategy, in, the, medieval, period, was, predominated, by, siege, warfare, fortifications, provided, a, powerful, bastion, of, defence, for, a, regional, populace, to, shelter, from, large, scale, pillaging, that, characterised, groups, such, as, the, vikings, or, mongols, and, castles, evolved, as, a, central, point, of, control, and, protection, for, local, elites, to, exercise, their, authority, over, a, given, area, fortifications, also, nullified, the, dominant, weapon, of, the, medieval, battlefield, heavy, cavalry, pitched, battles, were, generally, rare, compared, to, the, classical, period, due, to, a, dramatic, reduction, in, logistical, capability, and, those, that, were, fought, tended, to, be, decisive, encounters, that, risked, the, deaths, of, the, leaders, and, the, potential, destruction, of, the, army, as, a, fighting, force, discouraging, them, from, taking, place, the, wars, of, the, roses, were, anomalous, in, this, regard, nobles, had, a, great, deal, to, lose, by, the, ruin, of, the, countryside, in, a, protracted, conflict, so, they, tended, to, deliberately, seek, pitched, battles, to, resolve, their, grievances, quickly, and, decisively, the, code, of, chivalry, governed, the, actions, of, nobles, in, medieval, warfare, in, particular, nobles, would, often, go, to, great, lengths, to, take, a, fellow, noble, prisoner, during, combat, in, order, to, ransom, them, for, a, sum, of, money, rather, than, simply, killing, them, however, the, concept, of, chivalry, had, been, in, decline, for, many, years, prior, to, the, wars, of, the, roses, for, example, the, battle, at, crecy, in, 1346, over, a, century, prior, saw, the, cream, of, french, nobility, cut, down, by, english, archers, and, the, killing, of, many, wounded, french, knights, by, common, soldiers, the, wars, of, the, roses, continued, this, trend, edward, iv, was, noted, by, contemporary, philippe, de, commines, as, ordering, his, troops, to, spare, common, soldiers, and, kill, the, nobles, ensuring, the, deaths, of, nobles, in, battle, often, led, to, one, side, wielding, lopsided, political, control, in, the, aftermath, as, a, result, as, occurred, after, towton, at, which, 42, captured, knights, were, executed, and, barnet, which, irrevocably, broke, the, influence, of, the, powerful, neville, family, nobles, who, escaped, battle, may, be, attainted, thereby, being, stripped, of, their, lands, and, titles, and, would, therefore, be, of, no, value, to, a, captor, knights, during, the, wars, of, the, roses, typically, valued, money, land, and, sabotaging, other, factions, even, within, or, allied, to, the, same, house, they, perceived, as, not, supporting, them, enough, much, like, their, campaigns, in, france, the, english, gentry, fought, on, foot, though, heavy, cavalry, had, been, the, dominant, class, of, soldier, on, the, medieval, battlefield, for, centuries, the, relative, inexpensiveness, to, train, and, outfit, an, infantryman, compared, to, an, expensive, mounted, knight, incentivised, leaders, for, expanding, their, use, and, the, late, medieval, battlefield, saw, an, increased, use, of, infantry, and, light, cavalry, in, particular, english, armies, were, characterised, by, their, use, of, massed, longbowmen, which, often, proved, decisive, in, their, encounters, with, french, cavalry, however, as, the, english, nobility, fought, on, foot, and, due, to, advances, in, fluted, plate, armour, neither, side, possessed, a, decisive, tactical, advantage, from, the, use, of, these, archers, an, exception, to, this, was, at, towton, where, the, yorkist, archers, took, advantage, of, the, high, winds, to, extend, their, maximum, range, dealing, disproportionate, damage, to, their, lancastrian, opponents, english, armies, of, the, time, tended, to, favour, a, mix, between, infantry, equipped, with, bills, supported, by, massed, longbowmen, a, combination, they, would, continue, to, use, well, into, the, tudor, period, despite, their, frequent, association, with, medieval, warfare, swords, were, rare, among, the, common, soldiery, and, were, instead, favoured, by, men, at, arms, or, knights, as, a, personal, weapon, indicating, prestige, and, wealth, other, weapons, commonly, used, by, infantry, and, men, at, arms, include, axes, halberds, crossbows, and, daggers, hand, cannon, and, arquebuses, were, used, by, both, sides, however, their, numbers, were, limited, while, cannons, were, used, as, early, as, 1346, at, crecy, these, were, crude, ribauldequins, firing, metal, arrows, or, grapeshot, and, were, rendered, obsolete, by, bombards, that, came, in, the, late, 15th, century, bamburgh, castle, previously, thought, impregnable, was, captured, thanks, to, bombards, in, 1464, cannons, were, used, sparingly, northampton, was, the, first, battle, on, english, soil, in, which, they, were, used, early, cannon, were, expensive, to, cast, as, they, were, often, made, from, bronze, as, such, few, commanders, were, willing, to, risk, their, capture, on, the, field, at, barnet, in, 1471, the, yorkist, artillery, withheld, their, fire, so, as, not, to, betray, their, location, the, invention, of, the, blast, furnace, in, sweden, in, the, mid, 14th, century, increased, and, improved, iron, production, which, led, to, advances, in, plate, armour, to, protect, soldiers, from, the, powerful, crossbows, longbows, and, the, advent, of, gunpowder, weaponry, such, as, the, hand, cannon, and, the, arquebus, that, began, to, emerge, around, the, same, time, by, the, 15th, century, plate, armour, had, become, cheaper, than, mail, although, mail, continued, to, be, used, to, protect, joints, which, could, not, be, adequately, protected, by, plate, such, as, the, armpit, crook, of, the, elbow, and, groin, contrary, to, the, popular, preconception, of, medieval, armour, as, excessively, heavy, a, full, suit, of, medieval, armour, in, the, 15th, century, seldom, weighed, more, than, 15, kg, 33, lbs, substantially, less, than, the, loads, that, modern, ground, combat, troops, carry, following, the, climax, of, the, hundred, years, war, large, numbers, of, experienced, unemployed,
