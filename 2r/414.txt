cavalry, charge, in, history, capturing, the, city, of, vienna, had, long, been, a, strategic, aspiration, of, the, ottoman, empire, due, to, the, control, the, city, had, over, the, danube, and, the,

well, as, the, forwarding, of, ammunition, cannon, and, other, resources, from, all, over, the, empire, to, these, centers, and, into, the, balkans, the, siege, of, szigetv, r, in, 1566, blocked, the,

principles, and, his, desire, to, suppress, protestantism, in, 1681, protestants, and, other, anti, habsburg, kuruc, forces, led, by, imre, th, k, ly, were, reinforced, with, a, significant, military, contingent, from, the, ottomans, 657, who, recognized, th, k, ly, as, king, of, upper, hungary, the, eastern, part, of, modern, day, slovakia, and, parts, of, northeastern, hungary, which, he, had, earlier, taken, by, force, from, the, habsburgs, this, support, included, explicitly, promising, the, kingdom, of, vienna, to, the, hungarians, if, it, fell, into, ottoman, hands, yet, before, the,

between, the, forces, of, imre, th, k, ly, and, the, holy, roman, empire, the, border, of, which, was, then, northern, hungary, intensified, and, the, incursions, of, habsburg, forces, into, central, hungary, provided, the, crucial, argument, of, grand, vizier, kara, mustafa, pasha, in, convincing, sultan, mehmed, iv, and, his, divan, to, allow, the, movement, of, the, ottoman, army, mehmed, iv, authorized, mustafa, pasha, to, operate, as, far, as, gy, r, then, known, as, yan, kkale, and, in, german, as, raab, and, kom, rom, in, turkish, komaron, komorn, in, german, castles, both, in,

impossible, to, launch, an, invasion, in, august, or, september, 1682, since, a, three, month, campaign, would, have, taken, the, ottomans, to, vienna, just, as, winter, set, in, but, the, 15, month, gap, between, mobilization, and, the, launch, of, a, full, scale, invasion, provided, ample, time, for, vienna, to, prepare, its, defense, and, for, leopold, to, assemble, troops, from, the, holy, roman, empire, and, form, an, alliance, with, poland, venice, and, pope, innocent, xi, the, defensive, alliance, of, the, holy, roman, empire, with, poland, was, concluded, in, the, 1683, treaty, of,

july, the, city, s, only, defense, force, was, now, that, of, count, ernst, r, diger, von, starhemberg, s, 15, 000, men, 660, saxon, engineer, georg, rimpler, who, had, been, employed, by, the, empire, to, prepare, for, war, with, the, turks, began, to, prepare, vienna, for, the, upcoming, siege, much, of, austria, s, pre, war, plans, had, calculated, on, fighting, the, turks, near, the, city, of, gy, r, a, plan, made, untenable, by, the, turkish, advance, the, king, of, poland, john, iii, sobieski, prepared, a, relief, expedition, to, vienna, during, the, summer, of, 1683, honoring, his, obligations, to, the, treaty, and, would, depart, from, krak, w, on, 15, august, during, this, time, most, of, poland, would, be, largely, undefended, and, taking, advantage, of, the, situation, imre, th, k, ly, would, attempt, an, invasion, kazimierz, jan, sapieha, delayed, the, march, of, the, lithuanian, army, campaigning, in, the, hungarian, highlands, instead, and, arrived, in, vienna, only, after, it, had, been, relieved, immediately, tensions, rose, between, poland, and, the, various, german, states, especially, austria, over, the, relief, of, the, city, payment, of, troops, wages, and, supplies, while, marching, would, be, the, predominant, issue, sobieski, insisted, that, he, should, not, have, to, pay, for, his, march, to, vienna, since, it, was, by, his, efforts, that, the, city, had, been, saved, nor, could, the, viennese, neglect, the, other, german, troops, who, had, marched, the, habsburg, leadership, found, as, much, money, as, possible, to, pay, for, these, and, arranged, deals, with, the, polish, to, limit, their, costs, the, main, ottoman, army, laid, siege, to, vienna, on, 14, july, on, the, same, day, kara, mustafa, sent, the, traditional, demand, that, the, city, surrender, to, the, ottoman, empire, ernst, r, diger, graf, von, starhemberg, leader, of, the, remaining, 15, 000, troops, and, 8, 700, volunteers, with, 370, cannons, refused, to, capitulate, only, days, before, he, had, received, news, of, the, mass, slaughter, at, perchtoldsdorf, a, town, south, of, vienna, where, the, citizens, had, handed, over, the, keys, of, the, city, after, having, been, given, a, similar, choice, but, were, killed, anyway, siege, operations, started, on, 17, july, 660, the, viennese, had, demolished, many, of, the, houses, around, the, city, walls, and, cleared, the, debris, leaving, an, empty, plain, that, would, expose, the, ottomans, to, defensive, fire, if, they, tried, to, rush, into, the, city, 660, in, response, to, this, kara, mustafa, pasha, would, order, his, forces, to, dig, long, lines, of, trenches, directly, toward, the, city, to, help, protect, them, from, the, defenders, as, they, advanced, the, ottomans, had, 130, field, guns, and, 19, medium, caliber, cannon, compared, to, the, defenders, 370, mining, tunnels, were, dug, under, the, city, walls, which, would, then, be, filled, with, sufficient, quantities, of, black, powder, to, demolish, the, walls, 660, according, to, andrew, wheatcroft, the, outer, palisade, was, around, 150, years, old, and, mostly, rotten, to, counter, this, the, defenders, set, to, work, knocking, very, large, tree, trunks, into, the, ground, to, surround, the, walls, this, disrupted, the, ottoman, plan, of, a, quick, siege, adding, almost, another, three, weeks, to, the, time, it, would, take, to, get, past, the, old, palisade, this, combined, with, the, delay, in, advancing, their, army, after, declaring, war, eventually, allowed, a, relief, force, to, arrive, in, september, 660, some, historians, have, speculated, that, kara, mustafa, wanted, to, take, the, city, intact, with, its, riches, and, declined, an, all, out, attack, not, wishing, to, initiate, the, plundering, that, would, accompany, an, assault, which, was, viewed, as, the, right, of, conquering, soldiers, the, ottoman, siege, cut, virtually, all, means, of, food, supply, into, vienna, fatigue, became, so, common, that, von, starhemberg, ordered, any, soldier, found, asleep, on, watch, to, be, shot, increasingly, desperate, the, forces, holding, vienna, were, on, the, verge, of, defeat, when, in, august, imperial, forces, under, charles, v, duke, of, lorraine, defeated, th, k, ly, at, bisamberg, 5, km, 3, 1, mi, northwest, of, vienna, on, 6, september, the, poles, under, sobieski, crossed, the, danube, 30, km, 19, mi, northwest, of, vienna, at, tulln, to, unite, with, imperial, troops, and, the, additional, forces, from, saxony, bavaria, baden, and, other, imperial, estates, the, forces, were, also, joined, by, several, mercenary, regiments, of, zaporozhian, cossacks, hired, by, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, louis, xiv, of, france, declined, to, help, his, habsburg, rival, having, just, annexed, alsace, an, alliance, between, sobieski, and, emperor, leopold, i, resulted, in, the, addition, of, the, polish, hussars, to, the, existing, allied, army, the, command, of, the, european, allied, forces, was, assigned, to, the, polish, king, renowned, for, his, extensive, experience, in, leading, campaigns, against, the, ottoman, army, notably, he, achieved, a, decisive, victory, over, the, ottoman, forces, in, the, battle, of, khotyn, 1673, and, now, commanded, an, army, of, 70, 000, 80, 000, soldiers, countering, a, supposed, ottoman, force, of, 150, 000, 661, sobieski, s, courage, and, aptitude, for, command, were, already, known, in, europe, during, early, september, approximately, 5, 000, experienced, ottoman, sappers, had, repeatedly, demolished, large, portions, of, the, walls, between, the, burg, bastion, the, l, bel, bastion, and, the, burg, ravelin, creating, gaps, of, about, 12, metres, 39, ft, in, width, in, response, to, this, the, viennese, began, digging, their, own, tunnels, to, intercept, the, placing, of, large, amounts, of, gunpowder, in, the, caverns, the, ottomans, finally, managed, to, occupy, the, burg, ravelin, and, the, low, wall, nearby, on, 8, september, anticipating, a, breach, in, the, city, walls, the, remaining, viennese, prepared, to, fight, in, the, inner, city, in, this, table, only, household, and, retinue, troops, numbers, are, certain, 78, 500, and, 44, 200, while, other, troops, numbers, are, rounded, 50, 000, tatars, 10, 000, wallachian, 170, 000, rear, service, etc, based, on, this, kahraman, akul, claims, that, this, anonymous, table, shows, counted, numbers, of, household, and, retinue, troops, while, number, of, provincial, troops, t, marl, sipahi, 40, 000, and, vassal, states, troops, 100, 000, are, expected, numbers, for, instance, tatars, nogais, and, circassians, number, was, more, than, 100, 000, while, this, table, shows, that, the, tatars, general,

turkish, cebeci, and, 4000, gunners, totaling, 32, 574, as, opposed, to, 60, 000, estimation, in, this, table, therefore, according, to, k, akul, s, assessment, the, ottoman, army, consisted, of, approximately, 120, 000, soldiers, and, 156, guns, within, their, ranks, 30, 000, troops, were, strategically, stationed, in, captured, castles, and, deployed, to, disrupt, the, approaching, relief, army, s, movements, according, to, austrian, ambassador, kunitz, the, besieging, ottoman, army, had, already, decreased, to, 90, 000, combatants, as, of, 12, august, kunitz, also, claimed, that, he, learned, from, ottoman, captives, that, casualties, were, reaching, 20, 000, by, end, of, august, other, austrian, sources, give, ottoman, casualties, as, 12, 000, until, 13, august, demonstrating, a,

stationed, away, from, the, siege, to, a, warweary, 40, 000, soldiers, k, akul, combines, kunitz, s, 90, 000, combatant, information, for, 12, august, with, an, ottoman, casualties, list, estimating, the, ottoman, army, as, 90, 000, men, 65, 000, soldiers, around, 60, guns, and, 25, 000, rear, service, but, kunitz, s, 90, 000, combatant, information, belongs, to, 12, august, while, the, ottoman, list, is, for, 10, september, the, ottoman, vassals, of, transylvania, wallachia, and, moldavia, were, assigned, to, hold, bridges, on, key, retreat, routes, thus, not, participating, in, the, battle, the, tatar, vassals, were, expected, to, participate, in, battle, by, the, ottomans, but, the, mostly, irregular, tatar, horsemen, demonstrated, little, effectiveness, in, battle, dissimilar, to, previous, engagements, a, lone, 28, 400, to, 50, 000, ottoman, army, would, battle, against, the, relief, army, consisting, of, 65, 000, soldiers, 68, 000, misinformation, is, originated, from,

forces, would, rush, to, prepare, a, response, despite, the, multinational, composition, of, the, army, and, the, short, space, of, only, six, days, an, effective, leadership, structure, was, established, centred, around, the, king, of, poland, and, his, heavy, cavalry, polish, hussars, the, holy, league, settled, the, issue, of, payment, by, using, all, available, funds, from, the, government, loans, from, several, wealthy, bankers, and, noblemen, and, large, sums, of, money, from, the, pope, the, habsburgs, and, poles, also, agreed, that, the, polish, government, would, pay, for, its, own, troops, while, still, in, poland, but, that, the, emperor, would, fund, them, once, they, crossed, into, imperial, territory, however, the, emperor, would, recognize, sobieski, s, claim, to, first, rights, of, plunder, of, the, enemy, camp, in, the, event, of, a, victory, the, combined, besieging, forces, led, by, kara, mustafa, were, less, united, and, facing, problems, with,

which, numbered, between, 30, 000, and, 40, 000, there, is, doubt, as, to, how, much, the, tatars, participated, in, the, final, battle, before, vienna, their, khan, refused, to, attack, the, relief, force, as, it, crossed, the, danube, on, pontoon, bridges, and, also, refused, to, attack, them, as, they, emerged, from, the, vienna, woods, the, ottoman, allies, of, wallachia, and, moldavia, would,

significant, damage, on, the, ottoman, forces, and, would, come, close, to, a, breakthrough, at, the, same, time, cantacuzino, and, his, soldiers, who, secretly, supported, the, christian, coalition, were, trying, to, sabotage, the, ottoman, siege, by, abandoning, the, bridge, over, the, danube, on, brigittenau, island, where, the, wallachians, had, been, stationed, in, order, to, cover, the, left, flank, of, the, ottoman, army, mustafa, pasha, launched, counterattacks, with, most, of, his, forces, but, held, back, some, of, the, elite, janissary, and, sipahi, units, for, a, simultaneous,
