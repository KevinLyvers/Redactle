and, eastern, shores, of, the, baltic, sea, and, also, against, orthodox, christian, east, slavs, the, most, notable, campaigns, were, the, livonian, and, prussian, crusades, some, of, these, wars, were, called, crusades, during, the, middle, ages, but, others, including, most, of, the, swedish, ones, were, first, dubbed, crusades, by, 19th, century, romantic, nationalist, historians, however, crusades, against, estonians, but, also, against, other, pagans, in, those, parts, were, authorized, by, pope, alexander, iii, in, the, bull, non, parum, animus, noster, in, 1171, or, 1172, at, the,

conflict, between, the, finnic, peoples, balts, and, slavs, who, dwelt, by, the, baltic, shores, and, their, saxon, and, danish, neighbors, to, the, north, and, south, had, been, common, for, several, centuries, before, the, crusade, the, previous, battles, had, largely, been, caused, by, attempts, to, destroy, castles, and, sea, trade, routes, to, gain, an, economic, advantage, in, the, region, and, the, crusade, basically, continued, this, pattern, of, conflict, albeit, now, inspired, and, prescribed, by, the, pope, and, undertaken, by, papal, knights, and, armed, monks, the, campaigns, started, with, the, 1147, wendish, crusade, against, the, polabian, slavs, or, wends, of, what, is, now, northern, and, eastern, germany, the, crusade, occurred, parallel, to, the, second, crusade,

were, made, in, 1191, and, in, 1202, the, latter, one, was, led, by, the, bishop, of, lund, anders, sunesen, with, his, brother, by, the, 12th, century, the, peoples, inhabiting, the, lands, now, known, as, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, formed, a, pagan, wedge, between, increasingly, powerful, rival, christian, states, the, orthodox, church, to, their, east, and, the, catholic, church, to, their, west, the, difference, in, creeds, was, one, of, the, reasons, they, were, able, to, resist, being, forcibly, converted, to, a, different, religion, during, a, period, of, more, than, 150,

letter, remains, unknown, and, was, not, necessarily, known, even, by, the, pope, however, as, the, trade, embargo, was, widened, eight, years, later, it, was, specifically, said, to, be, against, the, russians, based, on, papal, letters, from, 1229, the, bishop, of, finland, requested, the, pope, enforce, a, trade, embargo, against, novgorodians, on, the, baltic, sea, at, least, in, visby,

several, occasions, and, halted, the, eastward, expansion, of, the, teutonic, order, but, novgorodian, attempt, to, take, estonia, and, livonia, also, failed, and, the, area, was, firmly, dominated, by, the, teutonic, order
