the, partition, of, india, in, 1947, was, the, change, of, political, borders, and, the, division, of, other, assets, that, accompanied, the, dissolution, of, the, british, raj, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, the, creation, of, two, independent, dominions, in, south, asia, india, and, pakistan, the, dominion, of, india, is, today, the, republic, of, india, and, the, dominion, of, pakistan, which, at, the, time, comprised, two, regions, lying, on, either, side, of, india, is, now, the, islamic, republic, of, pakistan, and, the, people, s, republic, of, bangladesh, the, partition, was, outlined, in, the, indian, independence, act, 1947, the, change, of, political, borders, notably, included, the, division, of, two, provinces, of, british, india, bengal, and, punjab, the, majority, muslim, districts, in, these, provinces, were, awarded, to, pakistan, and, the, majority, non, muslim, to, india, the, other, assets, that, were, divided, included, the, british, indian, army, the, royal, indian, navy, the, royal, indian, air, force, the, indian, civil, service, the, railways, and, the, central, treasury, provisions, for, self, governing, independent, pakistan, and, india, legally, came, into, existence, at, midnight, on, 14, and, 15, august, 1947, respectively, the, partition, caused, large, scale, loss, of, life, and, an, unprecedented, migration, between, the, two, dominions, among, refugees, who, survived, it, solidified, the, belief, that, safety, lay, among, co, religionists, in, the, instance, of, pakistan, it, made, palpable, a, hitherto, only, imagined, refuge, for, the, muslims, of, british, india, the, migrations, took, place, hastily, and, with, little, warning, it, is, thought, that, between, 14, million, and, 18, million, people, moved, and, perhaps, more, excess, mortality, during, the, period, of, the, partition, is, usually, estimated, to, have, been, around, one, million, on, 13, january, 1948, mahatma, gandhi, started, his, fast, with, the, goal, of, stopping, the, violence, he, ended, his, fast, on, 18, january, at, the, urging, of, various, religious, and, political, leaders, who, pledged, to, put, an, end, to, the, violence, and, uphold, communal, harmony, the, term, partition, of, india, does, not, cover, nepal, and, bhutan, signed, treaties, with, the, british, designating, them, as, independent, states, and, were, not, a, part, of, british, ruled, india, the, himalayan, kingdom, of, sikkim, was, established, as, a, princely, state, after, the, anglo, sikkimese, treaty, of, 1861, but, its, sovereignty, had, been, left, undefined, in, 1947, sikkim, became, an, independent, kingdom, under, the, suzerainty, of, india, the, maldives, became, a, protectorate, of, the, british, crown, in, 1887, and, gained, its, independence, in, 1965, in, 1905, during, his, second, term, as, viceroy, of, india, lord, curzon, divided, the, bengal, presidency, the, largest, administrative, subdivision, in, british, india, into, the, muslim, majority, province, of, eastern, bengal, and, assam, and, the, hindu, majority, province, of, bengal, present, day, indian, states, of, west, bengal, bihar, jharkhand, and, odisha, curzon, s, act, the, partition, of, bengal, which, had, been, contemplated, by, various, colonial, administrations, since, the, time, of, lord, william, bentinck, though, never, acted, upon, was, to, transform, nationalist, politics, as, nothing, else, before, it, the, hindu, elite, of, bengal, many, of, whom, owned, land, that, was, leased, out, to, muslim, peasants, in, east, bengal, protested, strongly, the, large, bengali, hindu, middle, class, the, bhadralok, upset, at, the, prospect, of, bengalis, being, outnumbered, in, the, new, bengal, province, by, biharis, and, oriyas, felt, that, curzon, s, act, was, punishment, for, their, political, assertiveness, the, pervasive, protests, against, curzon, s, decision, predominantly, took, the, form, of, the, swadeshi, buy, indian, campaign, involving, a, boycott, of, british, goods, sporadically, but, flagrantly, the, protesters, also, took, to, political, violence, which, involved, attacks, on, civilians, the, violence, was, ineffective, as, most, planned, attacks, were, either, prevented, by, the, british, or, failed, the, rallying, cry, for, both, types, of, protest, was, the, slogan, bande, mataram, bengali, lit, hail, to, the, mother, the, title, of, a, song, by, bankim, chandra, chatterjee, which, invoked, a, mother, goddess, who, stood, variously, for, bengal, india, and, the, hindu, goddess, kali, the, unrest, spread, from, calcutta, to, the, surrounding, regions, of, bengal, when, calcutta, s, english, educated, students, returned, home, to, their, villages, and, towns, the, religious, stirrings, of, the, slogan, and, the, political, outrage, over, the, partition, were, combined, as, young, men, in, such, groups, as, jugantar, took, to, bombing, public, buildings, staging, armed, robberies, and, assassinating, british, officials, since, calcutta, was, the, imperial, capital, both, the, outrage, and, the, slogan, soon, became, known, nationally, the, overwhelming, predominantly, hindu, protest, against, the, partition, of, bengal, along, with, the, fear, of, reforms, favouring, the, hindu, majority, led, the, muslim, elite, of, india, in, 1906, to, the, new, viceroy, lord, minto, asking, for, separate, electorates, for, muslims, in, conjunction, they, demanded, representation, in, proportion, to, their, share, of, the, total, population, reflecting, both, their, status, as, former, rulers, and, their, record, of, cooperating, with, the, british, this, would, result, in, the, founding, of, the, all, india, muslim, league, in, dacca, in, december, 1906, although, curzon, by, now, had, returned, to, england, following, his, resignation, over, a, dispute, with, his, military, chief, lord, kitchener, the, league, was, in, favor, of, his, partition, plan, the, muslim, elite, s, position, which, was, reflected, in, the, league, s, position, had, crystallized, gradually, over, the, previous, three, decades, beginning, with, the, 1871, census, of, british, india, which, had, first, estimated, the, populations, in, regions, of, muslim, majority, for, his, part, curzon, s, desire, to, court, the, muslims, of, east, bengal, had, arisen, from, british, anxieties, ever, since, the, 1871, census, and, in, light, of, the, history, of, muslims, fighting, them, in, the, 1857, rebellion, and, the, second, anglo, afghan, war, in, the, three, decades, since, the, 1871, census, muslim, leaders, across, north, india, had, intermittently, experienced, public, animosity, from, some, of, the, new, hindu, political, and, social, groups, the, arya, samaj, for, example, had, not, only, supported, the, cow, protection, movement, in, their, agitation, but, also, distraught, at, the, census, muslim, numbers, organized, reconversion, events, for, the, purpose, of, welcoming, muslims, back, to, the, hindu, fold, in, the, united, provinces, muslims, became, anxious, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, hindu, political, representation, increased, and, hindus, were, politically, mobilized, in, the, hindi, urdu, controversy, and, the, anti, cow, killing, riots, of, 1893, in, 1905, muslim, fears, grew, when, tilak, and, lajpat, rai, attempted, to, rise, to, leadership, positions, in, the, congress, and, the, congress, itself, rallied, around, the, symbolism, of, kali, it, was, not, lost, on, many, muslims, for, example, that, the, bande, mataram, rallying, cry, had, first, appeared, in, the, novel, anandmath, in, which, hindus, had, battled, their, muslim, oppressors, lastly, the, muslim, elite, including, nawab, of, dacca, khwaja, salimullah, who, hosted, the, league, s, first, meeting, in, his, mansion, in, shahbag, were, aware, that, a, new, province, with, a, muslim, majority, would, directly, benefit, muslims, aspiring, to, political, power, world, war, i, would, prove, to, be, a, watershed, in, the, imperial, relationship, between, britain, and, india, 1, 4, million, indian, and, british, soldiers, of, the, british, indian, army, would, take, part, in, the, war, and, their, participation, would, have, a, wider, cultural, fallout, news, of, indian, soldiers, fighting, and, dying, with, british, soldiers, as, well, as, soldiers, from, dominions, like, canada, and, australia, would, travel, to, distant, corners, of, the, world, both, in, newsprint, and, by, the, new, medium, of, the, radio, india, s, international, profile, would, thereby, rise, and, would, continue, to, rise, during, the, 1920s, it, was, to, lead, among, other, things, to, india, under, its, name, becoming, a, founding, member, of, the, league, of, nations, in, 1920, and, participating, under, the, name, les, indes, anglaises, british, india, in, the, 1920, summer, olympics, in, antwerp, back, in, india, especially, among, the, leaders, of, the, indian, national, congress, it, would, lead, to, calls, for, greater, self, government, for, indians, the, 1916, lucknow, session, of, the, congress, was, also, the, venue, of, an, unanticipated, mutual, effort, by, the, congress, and, the, muslim, league, the, occasion, for, which, was, provided, by, the, wartime, partnership, between, germany, and, turkey, since, the, ottoman, sultan, also, held, guardianship, of, the, islamic, holy, sites, of, mecca, medina, and, jerusalem, and, since, the, british, and, their, allies, were, now, in, conflict, with, the, ottoman, empire, doubts, began, to, increase, among, some, indian, muslims, about, the, religious, neutrality, of, the, british, doubts, that, had, already, surfaced, as, a, result, of, the, reunification, of, bengal, in, 1911, a, decision, that, was, seen, as, ill, disposed, to, muslims, in, the, lucknow, pact, the, league, joined, the, congress, in, the, proposal, for, greater, self, government, that, was, campaigned, for, by, tilak, and, his, supporters, in, return, the, congress, accepted, separate, electorates, for, muslims, in, the, provincial, legislatures, as, well, as, the, imperial, legislative, council, in, 1916, the, muslim, league, had, anywhere, between, 500, and, 800, members, and, did, not, yet, have, its, wider, following, among, indian, muslims, of, later, years, in, the, league, itself, the, pact, did, not, have, unanimous, backing, having, largely, been, negotiated, by, a, group, of, young, party, muslims, from, the, united, provinces, up, most, prominently, the, brothers, mohammad, and, shaukat, ali, who, had, embraced, the, pan, islamic, cause, it, gained, the, support, of, a, young, lawyer, from, bombay, muhammad, ali, jinnah, who, later, rose, to, leadership, roles, in, the, league, and, the, indian, independence, movement, in, later, years, as, the, full, ramifications, of, the, pact, unfolded, it, was, seen, as, benefiting, the, muslim, minority, elites, of, provinces, like, up, and, bihar, more, than, the, muslim, majorities, of, punjab, and, bengal, at, the, time, the, lucknow, pact, was, an, important, milestone, in, nationalistic, agitation, and, was, seen, so, by, the, british, secretary, of, state, for, india, montagu, and, viceroy, lord, chelmsford, presented, a, report, in, july, 1918, after, a, long, fact, finding, trip, through, india, the, previous, winter, after, more, discussion, by, the, government, and, parliament, in, britain, and, another, tour, by, the, franchise, and, functions, committee, to, identify, who, among, the, indian, population, could, vote, in, future, elections, the, government, of, india, act, of, 1919, also, known, as, the, montagu, chelmsford, reforms, was, passed, in, december, 1919, the, new, act, enlarged, both, the, provincial, and, imperial, legislative, councils, and, repealed, the, government, of, india, s, recourse, to, the, official, majority, in, unfavourable, votes, although, departments, like, defence, foreign, affairs, criminal, law, communications, and, income, tax, were, retained, by, the, viceroy, and, the, central, government, in, new, delhi, other, departments, like, public, health, education, land, revenue, local, self, government, were, transferred, to, the, provinces, the, provinces, themselves, were, now, to, be, administered, under, a, new, dyarchical, system, whereby, some, areas, like, education, agriculture, infrastructure, development, and, local, self, government, became, the, preserve, of, indian, ministers, and, legislatures, and, ultimately, the, indian, electorates, while, others, like, irrigation, land, revenue, police, prisons, and, control, of, media, remained, within, the, purview, of, the, british, governor, and, his, executive, council, the, new, act, also, made, it, easier, for, indians, to, be, admitted, into, the, civil, service, and, the, army, officer, corps, a, greater, number, of, indians, were, now, enfranchised, although, for, voting, at, the, national, level, they, constituted, only, 10, of, the, total, adult, male, population, many, of, whom, were, still, illiterate, in, the, provincial, legislatures, the, british, continued, to, exercise, some, control, by, setting, aside, seats, for, special, interests, they, considered, cooperative, or, useful, in, particular, rural, candidates, generally, sympathetic, to, british, rule, and, less, confrontational, were, assigned, more, seats, than, their, urban, counterparts, seats, were, also, reserved, for, non, brahmins, landowners, businessmen, and, college, graduates, the, principle, of, communal, representation, an, integral, part, of, the, minto, morley, reforms, and, more, recently, of, the, congress, muslim, league, lucknow, pact, was, reaffirmed, with, seats, being, reserved, for, muslims, sikhs, indian, christians, anglo, indians, and, domiciled, europeans, in, both, provincial, and, imperial, legislative, councils, the, montagu, chelmsford, reforms, offered, indians, the, most, significant, opportunity, yet, for, exercising, legislative, power, especially, at, the, provincial, level, though, restricted, by, the, still, limited, number, of, eligible, voters, by, the, small, budgets, available, to, provincial, legislatures, and, by, the, presence, of, rural, and, special, interest, seats, that, were, seen, as, instruments, of, british, control, the, two, nation, theory, is, the, assertion, based, on, the, former, indian, muslim, ruling, class, sense, of, being, culturally, and, historically, distinct, that, indian, hindus, and, muslims, are, two, distinct, nations, it, argued, that, religion, resulted, in, cultural, and, social, differences, between, muslims, and, hindus, while, some, professional, muslim, indian, politicians, used, it, to, secure, or, safeguard, a, large, share, of, political, spoils, for, the, indian, muslims, with, the, withdrawal, of, british, rule, others, believed, the, main, political, objective, was, the, preservation, of, the, cultural, entity, of, muslim, india, the, two, nation, theory, was, a, founding, principle, of, the, pakistan, movement, i, e, the, ideology, of, pakistan, as, a, muslim, nation, state, in, south, asia, and, the, partition, of, india, in, 1947, theodore, beck, who, played, a, major, role, in, founding, of, the, all, india, muslim, league, in, 1906, was, supportive, of, two, nation, theory, another, british, official, supportive, of, the, theory, includes, theodore, morison, both, beck, and, morison, believed, that, parliamentary, system, of, majority, rule, would, be, disadvantageous, for, the, muslims, arya, samaj, leader, lala, lajpat, rai, laid, out, his, own, version, of, two, nation, theory, in, 1924, to, form, a, clear, partition, of, india, into, a, muslim, india, and, a, non, muslim, india, lala, believed, in, partition, in, response, to, the, riots, against, hindus, in, kohat, north, west, frontier, province, which, diminished, his, faith, in, hindu, muslim, unity, hindu, mahasabha, leader, vinayak, damodar, savarkar, s, hindutva, ideology, had, embryonic, form, of, a, two, nation, theory, since, 1920s, savarkar, in, 1937, during, the, 19th, session, of, the, hindu, mahasabha, in, ahmedabad, supported, two, nation, theory, where, he, said, there, are, two, nations, in, the, main, the, hindus, and, the, muslims, in, india, muhammad, ali, jinnah, undertook, the, ideology, that, religion, is, the, determining, factor, in, defining, the, nationality, of, indian, muslims, in, 1940, he, termed, it, as, the, awakening, of, muslims, for, the, creation, of, pakistan, however, jinnah, opposed, partition, of, punjab, and, bengal, and, advocated, for, the, integration, of, all, punjab, and, bengal, into, pakistan, without, the, displacement, of, any, of, its, inhabitants, whether, they, were, sikhs, or, hindus, the, theory, is, also, a, source, of, inspiration, to, several, hindu, nationalist, organizations, with, causes, as, varied, as, the, redefinition, of, indian, muslims, as, non, indian, foreigners, and, second, class, citizens, in, india, the, expulsion, of, all, muslims, from, india, the, establishment, of, a, legally, hindu, state, in, india, prohibition, of, conversions, to, islam, and, the, promotion, of, conversions, or, reconversions, of, indian, muslims, to, hinduism, there, are, varying, interpretations, of, the, two, nation, theory, based, on, whether, the, two, postulated, nationalities, can, coexist, in, one, territory, or, not, with, radically, different, implications, one, interpretation, argued, for, sovereign, autonomy, including, the, right, to, secede, for, muslim, majority, areas, of, the, indian, subcontinent, but, without, any, transfer, of, populations, i, e, hindus, and, muslims, would, continue, to, live, together, a, different, interpretation, contends, that, hindus, and, muslims, constitute, two, distinct, and, frequently, antagonistic, ways, of, life, and, that, therefore, they, cannot, coexist, in, one, nation, in, this, version, a, transfer, of, populations, i, e, the, total, removal, of, hindus, from, muslim, majority, areas, and, the, total, removal, of, muslims, from, hindu, majority, areas, was, a, desirable, step, towards, a, complete, separation, of, two, incompatible, nations, that, cannot, coexist, in, a, harmonious, relationship, opposition, to, the, theory, has, come, from, two, sources, the, first, is, the, concept, of, a, single, indian, nation, of, which, hindus, and, muslims, are, two, intertwined, communities, this, is, a, founding, principle, of, the, modern, officially, secular, republic, of, india, even, after, the, formation, of, pakistan, debates, on, whether, muslims, and, hindus, are, distinct, nationalities, or, not, continued, in, that, country, as, well, the, second, source, of, opposition, is, the, concept, that, while, indians, are, not, one, nation, neither, are, the, muslims, or, hindus, of, the, subcontinent, and, it, is, instead, the, relatively, homogeneous, provincial, units, of, the, subcontinent, which, are, true, nations, and, deserving, of, sovereignty, the, baloch, have, presented, this, view, sindhi, and, pashtun, sub, nationalities, of, pakistan, and, the, assamese, and, punjabi, sub, nationalities, of, india, in, 1933, choudhry, rahmat, ali, had, produced, a, pamphlet, entitled, now, or, never, in, which, the, term, pakistan, land, of, the, pure, comprising, the, punjab, north, west, frontier, province, afghania, kashmir, sindh, and, balochistan, was, coined, for, the, first, time, it, did, not, attract, political, attention, and, a, little, later, a, muslim, delegation, to, the, parliamentary, committee, on, indian, constitutional, reforms, gave, short, shrift, to, the, idea, of, pakistan, calling, it, chimerical, and, impracticable, in, 1932, british, prime, minister, ramsay, macdonald, accepted, ambedkar, s, demand, for, the, depressed, classes, to, have, separate, representation, in, the, central, and, provincial, legislatures, the, muslim, league, favoured, this, communal, award, as, it, had, the, potential, to, weaken, the, hindu, caste, leadership, mahatma, gandhi, who, was, seen, as, a, leading, advocate, for, dalit, rights, went, on, a, fast, to, persuade, the, british, to, repeal, these, separate, electorates, ambedkar, had, to, back, down, when, it, seemed, gandhi, s, life, was, threatened, two, years, later, the, government, of, india, act, 1935, introduced, provincial, autonomy, increasing, the, number, of, voters, in, india, to, 35, million, more, significantly, law, and, order, issues, were, for, the, first, time, devolved, from, british, authority, to, provincial, governments, headed, by, indians, this, increased, muslim, anxieties, about, eventual, hindu, domination, in, the, 1937, indian, provincial, elections, the, muslim, league, turned, out, its, best, performance, in, muslim, minority, provinces, such, as, the, united, provinces, where, it, won, 29, of, the, 64, reserved, muslim, seats, in, the, muslim, majority, regions, of, the, punjab, and, bengal, regional, parties, outperformed, the, league, in, punjab, the, unionist, party, of, sikandar, hayat, khan, won, the, elections, and, formed, a, government, with, the, support, of, the, indian, national, congress, and, the, shiromani, akali, dal, which, lasted, five, years, in, bengal, the, league, had, to, share, power, in, a, coalition, headed, by, a, k, fazlul, huq, the, leader, of, the, krishak, praja, party, the, congress, on, the, other, hand, with, 716, wins, in, the, total, of, 1585, provincial, assemblies, seats, was, able, to, form, governments, in, 7, out, of, the, 11, provinces, of, british, india, in, its, manifesto, congress, maintained, that, religious, issues, were, of, lesser, importance, to, the, masses, than, economic, and, social, issues, the, election, revealed, that, it, had, contested, just, 58, out, of, the, total, 482, muslim, seats, and, of, these, it, won, in, only, 26, in, up, where, the, congress, won, it, offered, to, share, power, with, the, league, on, condition, that, the, league, stops, functioning, as, a, representative, only, of, muslims, which, the, league, refused, this, proved, to, be, a, mistake, as, it, alienated, congress, further, from, the, muslim, masses, besides, the, new, up, provincial, administration, promulgated, cow, protection, and, the, use, of, hindi, the, muslim, elite, in, up, was, further, alienated, when, they, saw, chaotic, scenes, of, the, new, congress, raj, in, which, rural, people, who, sometimes, turned, up, in, large, numbers, in, government, buildings, were, indistinguishable, from, the, administrators, and, the, law, enforcement, personnel, the, muslim, league, conducted, its, investigation, into, the, conditions, of, muslims, under, congress, governed, provinces, the, findings, of, such, investigations, increased, fear, among, the, muslim, masses, of, future, hindu, domination, the, view, that, muslims, would, be, unfairly, treated, in, an, independent, india, dominated, by, the, congress, was, now, a, part, of, the, public, discourse, of, muslims, with, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, in, 1939, lord, linlithgow, viceroy, of, india, declared, war, on, india, s, behalf, without, consulting, indian, leaders, leading, the, congress, provincial, ministries, to, resign, in, protest, by, contrast, the, muslim, league, which, functioned, under, state, patronage, organized, deliverance, day, celebrations, from, congress, dominance, and, supported, britain, in, the, war, effort, when, linlithgow, met, with, nationalist, leaders, he, gave, the, same, status, to, jinnah, as, he, did, to, gandhi, and, a, month, later, described, the, congress, as, a, hindu, organization, in, march, 1940, in, the, league, s, annual, three, day, session, in, lahore, jinnah, gave, a, two, hour, speech, in, english, in, which, were, laid, out, the, arguments, of, the, two, nation, theory, stating, in, the, words, of, historians, talbot, and, singh, that, muslims, and, hindus, were, irreconcilably, opposed, monolithic, religious, communities, and, as, such, no, settlement, could, be, imposed, that, did, not, satisfy, the, aspirations, of, the, former, on, the, last, day, of, its, session, the, league, passed, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, lahore, resolution, sometimes, also, pakistan, resolution, demanding, that, the, areas, in, which, the, muslims, are, numerically, in, the, majority, as, in, the, north, western, and, eastern, zones, of, india, should, be, grouped, to, constitute, independent, states, in, which, the, constituent, units, shall, be, autonomous, and, sovereign, though, it, had, been, founded, more, than, three, decades, earlier, the, league, would, gather, support, among, south, asian, muslims, only, during, the, second, world, war, in, august, 1940, lord, linlithgow, proposed, that, india, be, granted, dominion, status, after, the, war, having, not, taken, the, pakistan, idea, seriously, linlithgow, supposed, that, what, jinnah, wanted, was, a, non, federal, arrangement, without, hindu, domination, to, allay, muslim, fears, of, hindu, domination, the, august, offer, was, accompanied, by, the, promise, that, a, future, constitution, would, consider, the, views, of, minorities, neither, the, congress, nor, the, muslim, league, were, satisfied, with, the, offer, and, both, rejected, it, in, september, the, congress, once, again, started, a, program, of, civil, disobedience, in, march, 1942, with, the, japanese, fast, moving, up, the, malayan, peninsula, after, the, fall, of, singapore, and, with, the, americans, supporting, independence, for, india, winston, churchill, then, britain, s, prime, minister, sent, sir, stafford, cripps, leader, of, the, house, of, commons, with, an, offer, of, dominion, status, to, india, at, the, end, of, the, war, in, return, for, the, congress, s, support, for, the, war, effort, not, wishing, to, lose, the, support, of,

empire, would, be, forced, to, join, the, post, war, dominion, the, league, rejected, the, offer, seeing, this, clause, as, insufficient, in, meeting, the, principle, of, pakistan, as, a, result, of, that, proviso, the, proposals, were, also, rejected, by, the, congress, which, since, its, founding, as, a, polite, group, of, lawyers, in, 1885, saw, itself, as, the, representative, of, all, indians, of, all, faiths, after, the, arrival, in, 1920, of, gandhi, the, pre, eminent, strategist, of, indian, nationalism, the, congress, had, been, transformed, into, a, mass, nationalist, movement, of, millions, in, august, 1942, congress, launched, the, quit, india, resolution, asking, for, drastic, constitutional, changes, which, the, british, saw, as, the, most, serious, threat, to, their, rule, since, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, with, their, resources, and, attention, already, spread, thin, by, a, global, war, the, nervous, british, immediately, jailed, the, congress, leaders, and, kept, them, in, jail, until, august, 1945, whereas, the, muslim, league, was, now, free, for, the, next, three, years, to, spread, its, message, consequently, the, muslim, league, s, ranks, surged, during, the, war, with, jinnah, himself, admitting, the, war, which, nobody, welcomed, proved, to, be, a, blessing, in, disguise, although, there, were, other, important, national, muslim, politicians, such, as, congress, leader, abul, kalam, azad, and, influential, regional, muslim, politicians, such, as, a, k, fazlul, huq, of, the, leftist, krishak, praja, party, in, bengal, sikander, hyat, khan, of, the, landlord, dominated, punjab, unionist, party, and, abd, al, ghaffar, khan, of, the, pro, congress, khudai, khidmatgar, popularly, red, shirts, in, the, north, west,

british, and, congress, the, 1945, united, kingdom, general, election, was, won, by, the, labour, party, a, government, headed, by, clement, attlee, with, stafford, cripps, and, lord, pethick,

had, been, exhausted, by, the, second, world, war, and, the, british, public, did, not, appear, to, be, enthusiastic, about, costly, distant, involvements, late, in, 1945, the, british, government, decided, to, end, british, raj, in, india, and, in, early, 1947, britain, announced, its, intention, of, transferring, power, no, later, than, june, 1948, attlee, wrote, later, in, a, memoir, that, he, moved, quickly, to, restart, the, self, rule, process, because, he, expected, colonial, rule, in, asia, to, meet, renewed, opposition, after, the, war, from, both, nationalist, movements, and, the, united, states, while, his, exchequer, feared, that, post, war, britain, could, no, longer, afford, to, garrison, an, expansive, empire, labour, prime, minister, clement, attlee, had, been, deeply, interested, in, indian, independence, since, the, 1920s, being, surrounded, by, labour, statesmen, who, were, affiliated, with, krishna, menon, and, the, india, league, and, for, years, had, supported, it, he, now, took, charge, of, the, government, position, and, gave, the, issue, the, highest, priority, a, cabinet, mission, was, sent, to, india, led, by, the, secretary, of, state, for, india, lord, pethick, lawrence, which, also, included, sir, stafford, cripps, who, had, visited, india, four, years, before, the, objective, of, the, mission, was, to, arrange, for, an, orderly, transfer, to, independence, in, february, 1946, mutinies, broke, out, in, the, armed, services, starting, with, raf, servicemen, frustrated, with, their, slow, repatriation, to, britain, these, mutinies, failed, to, turn, into, revolutions, as, the, mutineers, surrendered, after, the, congress, and, the, muslim, league, convinced, the, mutineers, that, they, won, t, get, victimised, in, early, 1946, new, elections, were, held, in, india, this, coincided, with, the, infamous, trial, of, three, senior, officers, shah, nawaz, khan, prem, sahgal, and, gurubaksh, singh, dhillon, of, subhas, chandra, bose, s, defeated, indian, national, army, ina, who, stood, accused, of, treason, now, as, the, trials, began, the, congress, leadership, although, having, never, supported, the, ina, chose, to, defend, the, accused, officers, and, successfully, rescued, the, ina, members, british, rule, had, lost, its, legitimacy, for, most, hindus, and, conclusive, proof, of, this, came, in, the, form, of, the, 1946, elections, with, the, congress, winning, 91, percent, of, the, vote, among, non, muslim, constituencies, thereby, gaining, a, majority, in, the, central, legislature, and, forming, governments, in, eight, provinces, and, becoming, the, legitimate, successor, to, the, british, government, for, most, hindus, if, the, british, intended, to, stay, in, india, the, acquiescence, of, politically, active, indians, to, british, rule, would, have, been, in, doubt, after, these, election, results, although, many, rural, indians, may, still, have, acquiesced, to, british, rule, at, this, time, the, muslim, league, won, the, majority, of, the, muslim, vote, as, well, as, most, reserved, muslim, seats, in, the, provincial, assemblies, and, it, also, secured, all, the, muslim, seats, in, the, central, assembly, recovering, from, its, performance, in, the, 1937, elections, the, muslim, league, was, finally, able, to, make, good, on, the, claim, that, it, and, jinnah, alone, represented, india, s, muslims, and, jinnah, quickly, interpreted, this, vote, as, a, popular, demand, for, a, separate, homeland, tensions, heightened, while, the, muslim, league, was, unable, to, form, ministries, outside, the, two, provinces, of, sind, and, bengal, with, the, congress, forming, a, ministry, in, the, nwfp, and, the, key, punjab, province, coming, under, a, coalition, ministry, of, the, congress, sikhs, and, unionists, the, british, while, not, approving, of, a, separate, muslim, homeland, appreciated, the, simplicity, of, a, single, voice, to, speak, on, behalf, of, india, s, muslims, britain, had, wanted, india, and, its, army, to, remain, united, to, keep, india, in, its, system, of, imperial, defense, with, india, s, two, political, parties, unable, to, agree, britain, devised, the, cabinet, mission, plan, through, this, mission, britain, hoped, to, preserve, the, united, india, which, they, and, the, congress, desired, while, concurrently, securing, the, essence, of, jinnah, s, demand, for, a, pakistan, through, groupings, the, cabinet, mission, scheme, encapsulated, a, federal, arrangement, consisting, of, three, groups, of, provinces, two, of, these, groupings, would, consist, of, predominantly, muslim, provinces, while, the, third, grouping, would, be, made, up, of, the, predominantly, hindu, regions, the, provinces, would, be, autonomous, but, the, centre, would, retain, control, over, the, defence, foreign, affairs, and, communications, though, the, proposals, did, not, offer, independent, pakistan, the, muslim, league, accepted, the, proposals, even, though, the, unity, of, india, would, have, been, preserved, the, congress, leaders, especially, nehru, believed, it, would, leave, the, center, weak, on, 10, july, 1946, nehru, gave, a, provocative, speech, rejected, the, idea, of, grouping, the, provinces, and, effectively, torpedoed, both, the, cabinet, mission, plan, and, the, prospect, of, a, united, india, after, the, cabinet, mission, broke, down, in, july, 1946, jinnah, held, a, press, conference, at, his, home, in, bombay, he, proclaimed, that, the, muslim, league, was, preparing, to, launch, a, struggle, and, that, they, have, chalked, out, a, plan, he, said, that, if, the, muslims, were, not, granted, a, separate, pakistan, then, they, would, launch, direct, action, when, asked, to, be, specific, jinnah, retorted, go, to, the, congress, and, ask, them, their, plans, when, they, take, you, into, their, confidence, i, will, take, you, into, mine, why, do, you, expect, me, alone, to, sit, with, folded, hands, i, also, am, going, to, make, trouble, the, next, day, jinnah, announced, 16, august, 1946, would, be, direct, action, day, and, warned, congress, we, do, not, want, war, if, you, want, war, we, accept, your, offer, unhesitatingly, we, will, either, have, a, divided, india, or, a, destroyed, india, on, that, morning, armed, muslim, gangs, gathered, at, the, ochterlony, monument, in, calcutta, to, hear, huseyn, shaheed, suhrawardy, the, league, s, chief, minister, of, bengal, who, in, the, words, of, historian, yasmin, khan, if, he, did, not, explicitly, incite, violence, certainly, gave, the, crowd, the, impression, that, they, could, act, with, impunity, that, neither, the, police, nor, the, military, would, be, called, out, and, that, the, ministry, would, turn, a, blind, eye, to, any, action, they, unleashed, in, the, city, that, very, evening, in, calcutta, hindus, were, attacked, by, returning, muslim, celebrants, who, carried, pamphlets, distributed, earlier, which, showed, a, clear, connection, between, violence, and, the, demand, for, pakistan, and, directly, implicated, the, celebration, of, direct, action, day, with, the, outbreak, of, the, cycle, of, violence, that, would, later, be, called, the, great, calcutta, killing, of, august, 1946, the, next, day, hindus, struck, back, and, the, violence, continued, for, three, days, in, which, approximately, 4, 000, people, died, according, to, official, accounts, both, hindus, and, muslims, although, india, had, outbreaks, of, religious, violence, between, hindus, and, muslims, before, the, calcutta, killings, were, the, first, to, display, elements, of, ethnic, cleansing, violence, was, not, confined, to, the, public, sphere, but, homes, were, entered, and, destroyed, and, women, and, children, were, attacked, although, the, government, of, india, and, the, congress, were, both, shaken, by, the, course, of, events, in, september, a, congress, led, interim, government, was, installed, with, jawaharlal, nehru, as, united, india, s, prime, minister, the, communal, violence, spread, to, bihar, where, hindus, attacked, muslims, to, noakhali, in, bengal, where, muslims, targeted, hindus, to, garhmukteshwar, in, the, united, provinces, where, hindus, attacked, muslims, and, on, to, rawalpindi, in, march, 1947, in, which, hindus,

but, with, adaptable, authority, to, ensure, a, british, withdrawal, with, minimal, setbacks, mountbatten, hoped, to, revive, the, cabinet, mission, scheme, for, a, federal, arrangement, for, india, but, despite, his, initial, keenness, for, preserving, the, centre, the, tense, communal, situation, caused, him, to, conclude, that, partition, had, become, necessary, for, a, quicker, transfer, of, power, when, lord, mountbatten, formally, proposed, the, plan, on, 3, june, 1947, patel, gave, his, approval, and, lobbied, nehru, and, other, congress, leaders, to, accept, the, proposal, knowing, gandhi, s, deep, anguish, regarding, proposals, of, partition, patel, engaged, him, in, private, meetings, discussions, over, the, perceived, practical, unworkability, of, any, congress, league,

cannot, give, way, to, emotionalism, and, sentimentality, the, working, committee, has, not, acted, out, of, fear, but, i, am, afraid, of, one, thing, that, all, our, toil, and, hard, work, of, these, many, years, might, go, waste, or, prove, unfruitful, my, nine, months, in, office, have, completely, disillusioned, me, regarding, the, supposed, merits, of, the, cabinet, mission, plan, except, for,

some, emancipatory, effects, on, refugee, women, from, east, bengal, who, took, up, jobs, to, help, their, families, entered, the, public, space, and, participated, in, political, movements, the,

stating, that, from, 1951, to, 1956, a, total, of, 650, 000, muslims, from, india, relocated, to, west, pakistan, however, visaria, 1969, raised, doubts, about, the, authenticity, of, the, claims, about, indian, muslim, migration, to, pakistan, since, the, 1961, census, of, pakistan, did, not, corroborate, these, figures, however, the, 1961, census, of, pakistan, did, incorporate, a, statement,

informed, the, national, assembly, that, between, the, period, of, 1973, 1994, as, many, as, 800, 000, visitors, came, from, india, on, valid, travel, documents, of, these, only, 3, 393, stayed, in, a, related, trend, intermarriages, between, indian, and, pakistani, muslims, have, declined, sharply, according, to, a, november, 1995, statement, of, riaz, khokhar, the, pakistani, high, commissioner, in, new, delhi, the, number, of, cross, border, marriages, has, dropped, from, 40, 000, a, year, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, to, barely, 300, annually, in, the, aftermath, of, the, indo,

million, crude, estimates, suggest, that, about, 1, 5, million, muslims, migrated, from, west, bengal, and, bihar, to, east, bengal, in, the, two, decades, after, partition, due, to, religious, persecution, in, pakistan, hindus, continue, to, flee, to, india, most, of, them, tend, to, settle, in, the, state, of, rajasthan, in, india, according, to, data, of, the, human, rights, commission, of, pakistan, just, around, 1, 000, hindu, families, fled, to, india, in, 2013, in, may, 2014, a, member, of, the, ruling, pakistan, muslim, league, nawaz, pml, n, ramesh, kumar, vankwani, revealed, in, the, national, assembly, of, pakistan, that, around, 5, 000, hindus, are, migrating, from, pakistan, to, india, every, year, since, india, is, not, a, signatory, to, the, 1951, united, nations, refugee, convention, it, refuses, to, recognise, pakistani, hindu, migrants, as, refugees, the, population, in, the, tharparkar, district, in, the, sindh, province, of, west, pakistan, was, 80, hindu, and, 20, muslim, at, the, time, of, independence, in, 1947, during, the, indo, pakistani, wars, of, 1965, and, 1971, an, estimated, 1, 500, hindu, families, fled, to, india, which, led, to, a, massive, demographic, shift, in, the, district, during, these, same, wars, 23, 300, hindu, families, also, migrated, to, jammu, division, from, azad, kashmir, and, west, punjab, the, migration, of, hindus, from, east, pakistan, to, india, continued, unabated, after, partition, the, 1951, census, in, india, recorded, that, 2, 5, million, refugees, arrived, from, east, pakistan, of, which, 2, 1, million, migrated, to, west, bengal, while, the, rest, migrated, to, assam, tripura, and, other, states, these, refugees, arrived, in, waves, and, did, not, come, solely, at, partition, by, 1973, their, number, reached, over, 6, million, the, following, data, displays, the, major, waves, of, refugees, from, east, pakistan, and, the, incidents, which, precipitated, the, migrations, in, 1978, india, gave, citizenship, to, 55, 000, pakistani, hindus, by, the, time, of, the, 1998, census, of, pakistan, muslims, made, up, 64, 4, of, the, population, and, hindus, 35, 6, of, the, population, in, tharparkar, around, 70, 000, hindus, migrated, to, india, due, to, increased, persecution, in, the, aftermath, of, the, riots, and, mob, attacks, in, response, to, demolition, of, the, babri, masjid, the, partition, was, a, highly, controversial, arrangement, and, remains, a, cause, of, much, tension, on, the, indian, subcontinent, today, according, to, american, scholar, allen, mcgrath, many, british, leaders, including, the, british, viceroy, mountbatten, were, unhappy, over, the, partition, of, india, louis, mountbatten, had, not, only, been, accused, of, rushing, the, process, through, but, also, is, alleged, to, have, influenced, the, radcliffe, line, in, india, s, favour, the, commission, took, longer, to, decide, on, a, final, boundary, than, on, the, partition, itself, thus, the, two, nations, were, granted, their, independence, even, before, there, was, a, defined, boundary, between, them, the, boundary, line, was, revealed, on, 17, august, two, days, after, the, partition, this, implied, that, the, boundary, location, was, delayed, in, order, to, complete, the, british, withdrawal, from, india, so, that, the, british, cannot, be, burdened, by, the, partition, some, critics, allege, that, british, haste, led, to, increased, cruelties, during, the, partition, because, independence, was, declared, prior, to, the, actual, partition, it, was, up, to, the, new, governments, of, india, and, pakistan, to, keep, public, order, no, large, population, movements, were, contemplated, the, plan, called, for, safeguards, for, minorities, on, both, sides, of, the, new, border, it, was, a, task, at, which, both, states, failed, there, was, a, complete, breakdown, of, law, and, order, many, died, in, riots, massacre, or, just, from, the, hardships, of, their, flight, to, safety, what, ensued, was, one, of, the, largest, population, movements, in, recorded, history, according, to, richard, symonds, at, the, lowest, estimate, half, a, million, people, perished, and, twelve, million, became, homeless, however, many, argue, that, the, british, were, forced, to, expedite, the, partition, by, events, on, the, ground, once, in, office, mountbatten, quickly, became, aware, that, if, britain, were, to, avoid, involvement, in, a, civil, war, which, seemed, increasingly, likely, there, was, no, alternative, to, partition, and, a, hasty, exit, from, india, law, and, order, had, broken, down, many, times, before, partition, with, much, bloodshed, on, both, sides, a, massive, civil, war, was, looming, by, the, time, mountbatten, became, viceroy, after, the, second, world, war, britain, had, limited, resources, perhaps, insufficient, to, the, task, of, keeping, order, another, viewpoint, is, that, while, mountbatten, may, have, been, too, hasty, he, had, no, real, options, left, and, achieved, the, best, he, could, under, difficult, circumstances, the, historian, lawrence, james, concurs, that, in, 1947, mountbatten, was, left, with, no, option, but, to, cut, and, run, the, alternative, seemed, to, be, involved, in, a, potentially, bloody, civil, war, from, which, it, would, be, difficult, to, get, out, venkat, dhulipala, rejects, the, idea, that, the, british, divide, and, rule, policy, was, responsible, for, partition, and, elaborates, on, the, perspective, that, pakistan, was, popularly, imagined, as, a, sovereign, islamic, state, or, a, new, medina, as, a, potential, successor, to, the, defunct, turkish, caliphate, and, as, a, leader, and, protector, of, the, entire, islamic, world, islamic, scholars, debated, over, creating, pakistan, and, its, potential, to, become, a, true, islamic, state, the, majority, of, barelvis, supported, the, creation, of, pakistan, and, believed, that, any, co, operation, with, hindus, would, be, counterproductive, most, deobandis, who, were, led, by, maulana, husain, ahmad, madani, were, opposed, to, the, creation, of, pakistan, and, the, two, nation, theory, according, to, them, muslims, and, hindus, could, be, a, part, of, a, single, nation, in, their, authoritative, study, of, the, partition, ian, talbot, and, gurharpal, singh, have, said, that, the, partition, was, not, the, inevitable, end, of, the, so, called, british, divide, and, rule, policy, nor, was, it, the, inevitable, end, of, hindu, muslim, differences, a, cross, border, student, initiative, the, history, project, was, launched, in, 2014, to, explore, the, differences, in, perception, of, the, events, leading, up, to, the, partition, the, project, resulted, in, a, book, that, explains, both, interpretations, of, the, shared, history, in, pakistan, and, india, in, 2010, a, berkeley, california, and, delhi, india, based, non, profit, organization, the, 1947, partition, archive, began,
