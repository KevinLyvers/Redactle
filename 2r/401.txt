the, cossacks, are, a, predominantly, east, slavic, orthodox, christian, people, originating, in, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, of, eastern, ukraine, and, southern, russia, historically, they, were, a, semi, nomadic, and, semi, militarized, people, who, while, under, the, nominal, suzerainty, of, various, eastern, european, states, at, the, time, were, allowed, a, great, degree, of, self, governance, in, exchange, for, military, service, although, numerous, linguistic, and, religious, groups, came, together, to, form, the, cossacks, most, of, them, coalesced, and, became, east, slavic, speaking, orthodox, christians, the, rulers, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, and, russian, empire, endowed, cossacks, with, certain, special, privileges, in, return, for, the, military, duty, to, serve, in, the, irregular, troops, zaporozhian, cossacks, were, mostly, infantry, soldiers, using, war, wagons, don, cossacks, were, mostly, cavalry, soldiers, the, various, cossack, groups, were, organized, along, military, lines, with, large, autonomous, groups, called, hosts, each, host, had, a, territory, consisting, of, affiliated, villages, called, stanitsas, they, inhabited, sparsely, populated, areas, in, the, dnieper, don, terek, and, ural, river, basins, and, played, an, important, role, in, the, historical, and, cultural, development, of, both, ukraine, and, parts, of, russia, the, cossack, way, of, life, persisted, via, both, direct, descendants, and, acquired, ideals, in, other, nations, into, the, twentieth, century, though, the, sweeping, societal, changes, of, the, russian, revolution, disrupted, cossack, society, as, much, as, any, other, part, of, russia, many, cossacks, migrated, to, other, parts, of, europe, following, the, establishment, of, the, soviet, union, while, others, remained, and, assimilated, into, the, communist, state, cohesive, cossack, based, units, were, organized, and, many, fought, for, both, nazi, germany, and, the, soviet, union, during, world, war, ii, after, world, war, ii, the, soviet, union, disbanded, the, cossack, units, within, the, soviet, army, leading, to, the, suppression, of, many, cossack, traditions, during, the, rule, of, joseph, stalin, and, his, successors, however, during, the, perestroika, era, in, the, late, 1980s, descendants, of, cossacks, began, to, revive, their, national, traditions, in, 1988, the, soviet, union, enacted, a, law, permitting, the, re, establishment, of, former, cossack, hosts, and, the, formation, of, new, ones, throughout, the, 1990s, numerous, regional, authorities, consented, to, delegate, certain, local, administrative, and, policing, responsibilities, to, these, reconstituted, cossack, hosts, between, 3, 5, and, 5, million, people, associate, themselves, with, the, cossack, cultural, identity, across, the, world, even, though, the, majority, especially, in, the, russian, federation, have, little, to, no, connection, to, the, original, cossack, people, because, cultural, ideals, and, legacy, changed, greatly, with, time, cossack, organizations, operate, in, russia, ukraine, belarus, kazakhstan, canada, and, the, united, states, max, vasmer, s, etymological, dictionary, traces, the, name, to, the, old, east, slavic, word, kozak, a, loanword, from, cuman, in, which, cosac, meant, free, man, but, also, conqueror, the, ethnonym, kazakh, is, from, the, same, turkic, root, in, written, sources, the, name, is, first, attested, in, the, codex, cumanicus, from, the, 13th, century, in, english, cossack, is, first, attested, in, 1590, it, is, unclear, when, people, other, than, the, brodnici, and, berladnici, which, had, a, romanian, origin, with, large, slavic, influences, began, to, settle, in, the, lower, reaches, of, major, rivers, such, as, the, don, and, the, dnieper, after, the, demise, of, the, khazars, their, arrival, was, probably, not, before, the, 13th, century, when, the, mongols, broke, the, power, of, the, cumans, who, had, assimilated, the, previous, population, on, that, territory, it, is, known, that, new, settlers, inherited, a, lifestyle, that, long, pre, dated, their, presence, including, that, of, the, turkic, cumans, and, the, circassian, kassaks, in, contrast, slavic, settlements, in, southern, ukraine, started, to, appear, relatively, early, during, cuman, rule, with, the, earliest, such, as, oleshky, dating, back, to, the, 11th, century, early, proto, cossack, groups, are, generally, reported, to, have, come, into, existence, within, what, is, now, ukraine, in, the, 13th, century, as, the, influence, of, cumans, grew, weaker, although, some, have, ascribed, their, origins, to, as, early, as, the, mid, 8th, century, some, historians, suggest, that, the, cossack, people, were, of, mixed, ethnic, origin, descending, from, east, slavs, turks, tatars, and, others, who, settled, or, passed, through, the, vast, steppe, some, turkologists, however, argue, that, cossacks, are, descendants, of, the, native, cumans, of, ukraine, who, had, lived, there, long, before, the, mongol, invasion, as, the, grand, duchies, of, moscow, and, lithuania, grew, in, power, new, political, entities, appeared, in, the, region, these, included, moldavia, and, the, crimean, khanate, in, 1261, slavic, people, living, in, the, area, between, the, dniester, and, the, volga, were, mentioned, in, ruthenian, chronicles, historical, records, of, the, cossacks, before, the, 16th, century, are, scant, as, is, the, history, of, the, ukrainian, lands, in, that, period, as, early, as, the, 15th, century, a, few, individuals, ventured, into, the, wild, fields, the, southern, frontier, regions, of, ukraine, separating, poland, lithuania, from, the, crimean, khanate, these, were, short, term, expeditions, to, acquire, the, resources, of, what, was, a, naturally, rich, and, fertile, region, teeming, with, cattle, wild, animals, and, fish, this, lifestyle, based, on, subsistence, agriculture, hunting, and, either, returning, home, in, the, winter, or, settling, permanently, came, to, be, known, as, the, cossack, way, of, life, crimean, nogai, slave, raids, in, eastern, europe, caused, considerable, devastation, and, depopulation, in, this, area, the, tatar, raids, also, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, the, cossacks, in, the, 15th, century, cossack, society, was, described, as, a, loose, federation, of, independent, communities, which, often, formed, local, armies, and, were, entirely, independent, from, neighboring, states, such, as, poland, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, and, the, crimean, khanate, according, to, mykhailo, hrushevsky, the, first, mention, of, cossacks, dates, back, to, the, 14th, century, although, the, reference, was, to, people, who, were, either, turkic, or, of, undefined, origin, hrushevsky, states, that, the, cossacks, may, have, descended, from, the, long, forgotten, antes, or, from, groups, from, the, berlad, territory, of, the, brodnici, in, present, day, romania, then, a, part, of, the, grand, duchy, of, halych, there, the, cossacks, may, have, served, as, self, defence, formations, organized, to, defend, against, raids, conducted, by, neighbors, the, first, international, mention, of, cossacks, was, in, 1492, when, crimean, khan, me, li, i, giray, complained, to, grand, duke, of, lithuania, alexander, jagiellon, that, his, cossack, subjects, from, kiev, and, cherkasy, had, pillaged, a, crimean, tatar, ship, the, duke, ordered, his, ukrainian, meaning, borderland, officials, to, investigate, execute, the, guilty, and, give, their, belongings, to, the, khan, 76, sometime, in, the, 16th, century, there, appeared, the, old, ukrainian, ballad, of, cossack, holota, about, a, cossack, near, kiliya, in, the, 16th, century, these, cossack, societies, merged, into, two, independent, territorial, organizations, as, well, as, other, smaller, still, detached, groups, there, are, also, references, to, the, less, well, known, tatar, cossacks, including, the, na, ayb, kl, r, and, meshchera, speaking, volga, finns, of, whom, sary, azman, was, the, first, don, ataman, these, groups, were, assimilated, by, the, don, cossacks, but, had, their, own, irregular, bashkir, and, meshchera, host, up, to, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, kalmyk, and, buryat, cossacks, also, deserve, mention, the, origins, of, the, cossacks, are, disputed, originally, the, term, referred, to, semi, independent, tatar, groups, qazaq, or, free, men, who, inhabited, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, north, of, the, black, sea, near, the, dnieper, river, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, the, term, was, also, applied, to, peasants, who, had, fled, to, the, devastated, regions, along, the, dnieper, and, don, rivers, where, they, established, their, self, governing, communities, until, at, least, the, 1630s, these, cossack, groups, remained, ethnically, and, religiously, open, to, virtually, anybody, although, the, slavic, element, predominated, there, were, several, major, cossack, hosts, in, the, 16th, century, near, the, dnieper, don, volga, and, ural, rivers, the, greben, cossacks, in, caucasia, and, the, zaporozhian, cossacks, mainly, west, of, the, dnieper, the, zaporizhian, sich, became, a, vassal, polity, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, during, feudal, times, under, increasing, pressure, from, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, in, the, mid, 17th, century, the, sich, declared, an, independent, cossack, hetmanate, the, hetmanate, was, initiated, by, a, rebellion, under, bohdan, khmelnytsky, against, polish, and, catholic, domination, known, as, the, khmelnytsky, uprising, afterwards, the, treaty, of, pereyaslav, 1654, brought, most, of, the, cossack, state, under, russian, rule, the, sich, with, its, lands, became, an, autonomous, region, under, the, russian, protectorate, the, don, cossack, army, an, autonomous, military, state, formation, of, the, don, cossacks, under, the, citizenship, of, the, moscow, state, in, the, don, region, in, 1671, 1786, began, a, systematic, conquest, and, colonization, of, lands, to, secure, the, borders, on, the, volga, the, whole, of, siberia, see, yermak, timofeyevich, and, the, yaik, ural, and, terek, rivers, cossack, communities, had, developed, along, the, latter, two, rivers, well, before, the, arrival, of, the, don, cossacks, by, the, 18th, century, cossack, hosts, in, the, russian, empire, occupied, effective, buffer, zones, on, its, borders, the, expansionist, ambitions, of, the, empire, relied, on, ensuring, cossack, loyalty, which, caused, tension, given, their, traditional, exercise, of, freedom, democracy, self, rule, and, independence, cossacks, such, as, stenka, razin, kondraty, bulavin, ivan, mazepa, and, yemelyan, pugachev, led, major, anti, imperial, wars, and, revolutions, in, the, empire, in, order, to, abolish, slavery, and, harsh, bureaucracy, and, to, maintain, independence, the, empire, responded, with, executions, and, tortures, the, destruction, of, the, western, part, of, the, don, cossack, host, during, the, bulavin,

try, to, encourage, the, cossacks, to, forget, the, men, and, their, uprisings, it, also, formally, dissolved, the, lower, dnieper, zaporozhian, cossack, host, and, destroyed, their, fortress, on, the, dnieper, the, sich, itself, this, may, in, part, have, been, due, to, the, participation, of, some, zaporozhian, and, other, ukrainian, exiles, in, pugachev, s, rebellion, during, his, campaign, pugachev, issued, manifestos, calling, for, restoration, of, all, borders, and, freedoms, of, both, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, and, the, lower, dnieper, nyzovyi, in, ukrainian, cossack,

and, its, numbers, increased, greatly, between, the, 15th, and, 17th, centuries, the, zaporozhian, cossacks, played, an, important, role, in, european, geopolitics, participating, in, a, series, of,

level, warfare, took, place, in, those, territories, for, most, of, the, period, of, the, commonwealth, 1569, 1795, prior, to, the, formation, of, the, zaporizhian, sich, cossacks, had, usually, been, organized, by, ruthenian, boyars, or, princes, of, the, nobility, especially, various, lithuanian, starostas, merchants, peasants, and, runaways, from, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, muscovy, and, moldavia, also, joined, the, cossacks, the, first, recorded, zaporizhian, host, prototype, was, formed, by, the, starosta, of, cherkasy, and, kaniv, dmytro, vyshnevetsky, who, built, a, fortress, on, the, island, of, little, khortytsia, on, the, banks, of, the, lower, dnieper, in, 1552, the, zaporizhian, host, adopted, a, lifestyle, that, combined, the, ancient, cossack, order, and, habits, with, those, of, the, knights, hospitaller, the, cossack, structure, arose, in, part, in, response, to, the, struggle, against, tatar, raids, socio, economic, developments, in, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, were, another, important, factor, in, the, growth, of, the, ukrainian, cossacks, during, the, 16th, century, serfdom, was, imposed, because, of, the, favorable, conditions, for, grain, sales, in, western, europe, this, subsequently, decreased, the, locals, land, allotments, and, freedom, of, movement, in, addition, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, government, attempted, to, impose, catholicism, and, to, polonize, the, local, ukrainian, population, the, basic, form, of, resistance, and, opposition, by, the, locals, and, burghers, was, flight, and, settlement, in, the, sparsely, populated, steppe, but, the, nobility, obtained, legal, ownership, of, vast, expanses, of, land, on, the, dnipro, from, the, polish, kings, and, then, attempted, to, impose, feudal, dependency, on, the, local, population, landowners, utilized, the, locals, in, war, by, raising, the, cossack, registry, in, times, of, hostility, and, then, radically, decreasing, it, and, forcing, the, cossacks, back, into, serfdom, in, times, of, peace, this, institutionalized, method, of, control, bred, discontent, among, the, cossacks, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, they, began, to, revolt, in, the, uprisings, of, kryshtof, kosynsky, 1591, 1593, severyn, nalyvaiko, 1594, 1596, hryhorii, loboda, 1596, marko, zhmailo, 1625, taras, fedorovych, 1630, ivan, sulyma,

pressure, on, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, led, to, the, government, making, concessions, to, the, zaporizhian, cossacks, king, stephen, b, thory, granted, them, certain, rights, and, freedoms, in, 1578, and, they, gradually, began, to, create, their, foreign, policy, they, did, so, independently, of, the, government, and, often, against, its, interests, as, for, example, with, their, role, in, moldavian, affairs, and, with, the, signing, of, a, treaty, with, emperor, rudolf, ii, in, the, 1590s, the, zaporizhian, cossacks, became, particularly, strong, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, 17th, century, under, the, leadership, of, hetman, petro, konashevych, sahaidachny, who, launched, successful, campaigns, against, the, tatars, and, turks, tsar, boris, godunov, had, incurred, the, hatred, of, ukrainian, cossacks, by, ordering, the, don, cossacks, to, drive, away, from, the, don, all, the, ukrainian, cossacks, fleeing, the, failed, uprisings, of, the, 1590s, this, contributed, to, the, ukrainian, cossacks, willingness, to, fight, against, him, in, 1604, 2, 000, zaporizhian, cossacks, fought, on, the, side, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, and, their, proposal, for, the, tsar, dmitri, i, against, the, muscovite, army, by, september, 1604, dmitri, i, had, gathered, a, force, of, 2, 500, men, of, whom, 1, 400, were, cossacks, two, thirds, of, these, cossacks, however, were, in, fact, ukrainian, civilians, only, 500, being, professional, ukrainian, cossacks, on, july, 4, 1610, 4, 000, ukrainian, cossacks, fought, in, the, battle, of, klushino, on, the, side, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, they, helped, to, defeat, a, combined, muscovite, swedish, army, and, facilitate, the, occupation, of, moscow, from, 1610, to, 1611, riding, into, moscow, with, stanis, aw, kiewski, the, final, attempt, by, king, sigismund, and, wladyslav, to, seize, the, throne, of, muscovy, was, launched, on, april, 6, 1617, although, wladyslav, was, the, nominal, leader, it, was, jan, karol, chodkiewicz, who, commanded, the, commonwealth, forces, by, october, the, towns, of, dorogobuzh, and, vyazma, had, surrendered, but, a, defeat, when, the, counterattack, on, moscow, by, chodkiewicz, failed, between, vyasma, and, mozhaysk, prompted, the, polish, lithuanian, army, to, retreat, in, 1618, petro, konashevych, sahaidachny, continued, his, campaign, against, the, tsardom, of, russia, on, behalf, of, the, cossacks, and, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, numerous, russian, towns, were, sacked, including, livny, and, yelets, in, september, 1618, with, chodkiewicz, konashevych, sahaidachny, laid, siege, to, moscow, but, peace, was, secured, after, ottoman, polish, and, polish, muscovite, warfare, ceased, the, official, cossack, register, was, again, decreased, the, registered, cossacks, reiestrovi, kozaky, were, isolated, from, those, who, were, excluded, from, the, register, and, from, the, zaporizhian, host, this, together, with, intensified, socioeconomic, and, national, religious, oppression, of, the, other, classes, in, ukrainian, society, led, to, many, cossack, uprisings, in, the, 1630s, these, eventually, culminated, in, the, khmelnytsky, uprising, led, by, the, hetman, of, the, zaporizhian, sich, bohdan, khmelnytsky, as, a, result, of, the, mid, 17th, century, khmelnytsky, uprising, the, zaporozhian, cossacks, briefly, established, an, independent, state, which, later, became, the, autonomous, cossack, hetmanate, 1649, 1764, it, was, placed, under, the, suzerainty, of, the, russian, tsar, from, 1667, but, was, ruled, by, local, hetmans, for, a, century, the, principal, political, problem, of, the, hetmans, who, followed, the, pereyeslav, agreement, was, defending, the, autonomy, of, the, hetmanate, from, russian, muscovite, centralism, the, hetmans, ivan, vyhovsky, petro, doroshenko, and, ivan, mazepa, attempted, to, resolve, this, by, separating, ukraine, from, russia, relations, between, the, hetmanate, and, their, new, sovereign, began, to, deteriorate, after, the, autumn, of, 1656, when, the, muscovites, going, against, the, wishes, of, their, cossack, partners, signed, an, armistice, with, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, in, vilnius, the, cossacks, considered, the, vilnius, agreement, a, breach, of, the, contract, they, had, entered, into, at, pereiaslav, for, the, muscovite, tsar, the, pereiaslav, agreement, signified, the, unconditional, submission, of, his, new, subjects, the, ukrainian, hetman, considered, it, a, conditional, contract, from, which, one, party, could, withdraw, if, the, other, was, not, upholding, its, end, of, the, bargain, the, ukrainian, hetman, ivan, vyhovsky, who, succeeded, khmelnytsky, in, 1657, believed, the, tsar, was, not, living, up, to, his, responsibility, accordingly, he, concluded, a, treaty, with, representatives, of, the, polish, king, who, agreed, to, re, admit, cossack, ukraine, by, reforming, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, to, create, a, third, constituent, comparable, in, status, to, that, of, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, the, union, of, hadiach, provoked, a, war, between, the, cossacks, and, the, muscovites, russians, that, began, in, the, fall, of, 1658, in, june, 1659, the, two, armies, met, near, the, town, of, konotop, one, army, comprised, cossacks, tatars, and, poles, and, the, other, was, led, by, a, top, muscovite, military, commander, of, the, era, prince, aleksey, trubetskoy, after, terrible, losses, trubetskoy, was, forced, to, withdraw, to, the, town, of, putyvl, on, the, other, side, of, the, border, the, battle, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, zaporizhian, cossacks, most, impressive, victories, in, 1658, yurii, khmelnytsky, was, elected, hetman, of, the, zaporizhian, host, hetmanate, with, the, endorsement, of, moscow, and, supported, by, common, cossacks, unhappy, with, the, conditions, of, the, union, of, hadiach, in, 1659, however, yurii,

mazepa, of, the, ukrainian, cossacks, was, looking, for, an, opportunity, to, secure, independence, from, russia, and, poland, in, response, to, mazepa, s, alliance, with, charles, xii, of, sweden, peter, i, ordered, the, sacking, of, the, then, capital, of, the, hetmanate, baturyn, the, city, was, burnt, and, looted, and, 11, 000, to, 14, 000, of, its, inhabitants, were, killed, the, destruction, of, the, hetmanate, s, capital, was, a, signal, to, mazepa, and, the, hetmanate, s, inhabitants, of, severe, punishment, for, disloyalty, to, the, tsar, s, authority, one, of, the, zaporizhian, sichs, the, chortomlyk, sich, built, at, the, mouth, of, the, chortomlyk, river, in, 1652, was, also, destroyed, by, peter, i, s, forces, in, 1709, in, retribution, for, decision, of,

they, formed, the, danubian, sich, under, ottoman, rule, to, prevent, further, defection, of, cossacks, the, russian, government, restored, the, special, cossack, status, of, the, majority, of, zaporozhian, cossacks, this, allowed, them, to, unite, in, the, host, of, loyal, zaporozhians, and, later, to, reorganize, into, other, hosts, of, which, the, black, sea, host, was, most, important, because, of, land, scarcity, resulting, from, the, distribution, of, zaporozhian, sich, lands, among, landlords, they, eventually, moved, on, to, the, kuban, region, the, majority, of, danubian, sich, cossacks, moved, first, to, the, azov, region, in, 1828, and, later, joined, other, former, zaporozhian, cossacks, in, the, kuban, region, groups, were, generally, identified, by, faith, rather, than, language, in, that, period, and, most, descendants, of, zaporozhian, cossacks, in, the, kuban, region, are, bilingual, speaking, both, russian, and, balachka, the, local, kuban, dialect, of, central, ukrainian, their, folklore, is, largely, ukrainian, the, predominant, view, of, ethnologists, and, historians, is, that, its, origins, lie, in, the, common, culture, dating, back, to, the, black, sea, cossacks, the, major, powers, tried, to, exploit, cossack, warmongering, for, their, own, purposes, in, the, 16th, century, with, the, power, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, extending, south, the, zaporozhian, cossacks, were, mostly, if, tentatively, regarded, by, the, commonwealth, as, their, subjects, registered, cossacks, formed, a, part, of, the, commonwealth, army, until, 1699, around, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, increasing, cossack, aggression, strained, relations, between, the, commonwealth, and, the, ottoman, empire, cossacks, had, begun, raiding, ottoman, territories, in, the, second, part, of, the, 16th, century, the, polish, government, could, not, control, them, but, was, held, responsible, as, the, men, were, nominally, its, subjects, in, retaliation, tatars, living, under, ottoman, rule, launched, raids, into, the, commonwealth, mostly, in, the, southeast, territories, cossack, pirates, responded, by, raiding, wealthy, trading, port, cities, in, the, heart, of, the, ottoman, empire, as, these, were, just, two, days, away, by, boat, from, the, mouth, of, the, dnieper, river, in, 1615, and, 1625, cossacks, razed, suburbs, of, constantinople, forcing, the, ottoman, sultan, to, flee, his, palace, in, 1637, the, zaporozhian, cossacks, joined, by, the, don, cossacks, captured, the, strategic, ottoman, fortress, of, azov, which, guarded, the, don, consecutive, treaties, between, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, called, for, the, governments, to, keep, the, cossacks, and, tatars, in, check, but, neither, enforced, the, treaties, strongly, the, polish, forced, the, cossacks, to, burn, their, boats, and, stop, raiding, by, sea, but, the, activity, did, not, cease, entirely, during, this, time, the, habsburg, monarchy, sometimes, covertly, hired, cossack, raiders, against, the, ottomans, to, ease, pressure, on, their, own, borders, many, cossacks, and, tatars, developed, longstanding, enmity, due, to, the, losses, of, their, raids, the, ensuing, chaos, and, cycles, of, retaliation, often, turned, the, entire, southeastern, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, border, into, a, low, intensity, war, zone, it, catalyzed, escalation, of, commonwealth, ottoman, warfare, from, the, moldavian, magnate, wars, 1593, 1617, to, the, battle, of, cecora, 1620, and, campaigns, in, the, polish, ottoman, war, of, 1633, 1634, cossack, numbers, increased, when, the, warriors, were, joined, by, peasants, escaping, serfdom, in, russia, and, dependence, in, the, commonwealth, attempts, by, the, szlachta, to, turn, the, zaporozhian, cossacks, into, peasants, eroded, the, formerly, strong, cossack, loyalty, towards, the, commonwealth, the, government, constantly, rebuffed, cossack, ambitions, for, recognition, as, equal, to, the, szlachta, plans, for, transforming, the, polish, lithuanian, two, nation, commonwealth, into, a, polish, lithuanian, ruthenian, commonwealth, made, little, progress, due, to, the, unpopularity, among, the, ruthenian, szlachta, of, the, idea, of, ruthenian, cossacks, being, equal, to, them, and, their, elite, becoming, members, of, the, szlachta, the, cossacks, strong, historic, allegiance, to, the, eastern, orthodox, church, also, put, them, at, odds, with, officials, of, the, roman, catholic, dominated, commonwealth, tensions, increased, when, commonwealth, policies, turned, from, relative, tolerance, to, suppression, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, after, the, union, of, brest, the, cossacks, became, strongly, anti, roman, catholic, an, attitude, that, became, synonymous, with, anti, polish, the, waning, loyalty, of, the, cossacks, and, the, szlachta, s, arrogance, towards, them, resulted, in, several, cossack, uprisings, against, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, in, the, early, 17th, century, finally, the, king, s, adamant, refusal, to, accede, to, the, demand, to, expand, the, cossack, registry, prompted, the, largest, and, most, successful, of, these, the, khmelnytsky, uprising, that, began, in, 1648, some, cossacks, including, the, polish, szlachta, in, ukraine, converted, to, eastern, orthodoxy, divided, the, lands, of, the, ruthenian, szlachta, and, became, the, cossack, szlachta, the, uprising, was, one, of, a, series, of, catastrophic, events, for, the, commonwealth, known, as, the, deluge, which, greatly, weakened, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, and, set, the, stage, for, its, disintegration, 100, years, later, influential, relatives, of, the, ruthenian, and, lithuanian, szlachta, in, moscow, helped, to, create, the, russian, polish, alliance, against, khmelnitsky, s, cossacks, portrayed, as, rebels, against, order, and, against, the, private, property, of, the, ruthenian, orthodox, szlachta, don, cossacks, raids, on, crimea, left, khmelnitsky, without, the, aid, of, his, usual, tatar, allies, from, the, russian, perspective, the, rebellion, ended, with, the, 1654, treaty, of, pereyaslav, in, which, in, order, to, overcome, the, russian, polish, alliance, against, them, the, khmelnitsky, cossacks, pledged, their, loyalty, to, the, russian, tsar, in, return, the, tsar, guaranteed, them, his, protection, recognized, the, cossack, starshyna, nobility, their, property, and, their, autonomy, under, his, rule, and, freed, the, cossacks, from, the, polish, sphere, of, influence, and, the, land, claims, of, the, ruthenian, szlachta, only, some, of, the, ruthenian, szlachta, of, the, chernigov, region, who, had, their, origins, in, the, moscow, state, saved, their, lands, from, division, among, cossacks, and, became, part, of, the, cossack, szlachta, after, this, the, ruthenian, szlachta, refrained, from, plans, to, have, a, moscow, tsar, as, king, of, the, commonwealth, its, own, micha, korybut, wi, niowiecki, later, becoming, king, the, last, ultimately, unsuccessful, attempt, to, rebuild, the, polish, cossack, alliance, and, create, a, polish, lithuanian, ruthenian, commonwealth, was, the, 1658, treaty, of, hadiach, the, treaty, was, approved, by, the, polish, king, and, the, sejm, and, by, some, of, the, cossack, starshyna, including, hetman, ivan, vyhovsky, the, treaty, failed, however, because, the, starshyna, were, divided, on, the, issue, and, it, had, even, less, support, among, rank, and, file, cossacks, under, russian, rule, the, cossack, nation, of, the, zaporozhian, host, was, divided, into, two, autonomous, republics, of, the, russian, tsardom, the, cossack, hetmanate, and, the, more, independent, zaporizhia, these, organisations, gradually, lost, their, autonomy, and, were, abolished, by, catherine, ii, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, hetmanate, became, the, governorship, of, little, russia, and, zaporizhia, was, absorbed, into, new, russia, in, 1775, the, lower, dnieper, zaporozhian, host, was, destroyed, later, its, high, ranking, cossack, leaders, were, exiled, to, siberia,

to, emerge, as, conditions, worsened, and, mikhail, s, son, alexis, took, the, throne, older, cossacks, began, to, settle, and, become, prosperous, enjoying, privileges, earned, through, obeying, and, assisting, the, muscovite, system, 90, 91, 62, the, old, cossacks, started, giving, up, the, traditions, and, liberties, that, had, been, worth, dying, for, to, obtain, the, pleasures, of, an, elite, life, the, lawless, and, restless, runaway, peasants, who, called, themselves, cossacks, looked, for, adventure, and, revenge, against, the, nobility, that, had, caused, them, suffering, these, cossacks, did, not, receive, the, government, subsidies, that, the, old, cossacks, enjoyed, and, had, to, work, harder, and, longer, for, food, and, money, the, divisions, between, the, elite, and, the, lawless, led, to, the, formation, of, a, cossack, army, beginning, in, 1667, under, stenka, razin, and, ultimately, to, the, failure, of, razin, s, rebellion, stenka, razin, was, born, into, an, elite, cossack, family, and, had, made, many, diplomatic, visits, to, moscow, before, organizing, his, rebellion, 66, 67, the, cossacks, were, razin, s, main, supporters, and, followed, him, during, his, first, persian, campaign, in, 1667, plundering, and, pillaging, persian, cities, on, the, caspian, sea, they, returned, in, 1669, ill, and, hungry, tired, from, fighting, but, rich, with, plundered, goods, 95, 97, russia, tried, to, gain, support, from, the, old, cossacks, asking, the, ataman, or, cossack, chieftain, to, prevent, razin, from, following, through, with, his, plans, but, the, ataman, was, razin, s, godfather, and, was, swayed, by, razin, s, promise, of, a, share, of, expedition, wealth, his, reply, was, that, the, elite, cossacks, were, powerless, against, the, band, of, rebels, the, elite, did, not, see, much, threat, from, razin, and, his, followers, either, although, they, realized, he, could, cause, them, problems, with, the, muscovite, system, if, his, following, developed, into, a, rebellion, against, the, central, government, 95, 96, razin, and, his, followers, began, to, capture, cities, at, the, start, of, the, rebellion, in, 1669, they, seized, the, towns, of, tsaritsyn, astrakhan, saratov, and, samara, implementing, democratic, rule, and, releasing, peasants, from, slavery, as, they, went, 100, 105, razin, envisioned, a, united, cossack,

runaway, peasant, cossacks, old, towns, leading, them, to, wreak, havoc, there, and, take, revenge, on, their, old, masters, the, elder, cossacks, began, to, see, the, rebels, advance, as, a, problem, and, in, 1671, decided, to, comply, with, the, government, in, order, to, receive, more, subsidies, 112, on, april, 14, ataman, yakovlev, led, elders, to, destroy, the, rebel, camp, they, captured, razin, taking, him, soon, afterward, to, moscow, to, be, executed, razin, s, rebellion, marked, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, traditional, cossack, practices, in, august, 1671, russian, envoys, administered, the, oath, of, allegiance, and, the, cossacks, swore, loyalty, to, the, tsar, 113, while, they, still, had, internal, autonomy, the, cossacks, became, russian, subjects, a, transition, that, was, a, dividing, point, again, in, pugachev, s, rebellion, for, the, cossack, elite, noble, status, within, the, empire, came, at, the, price, of, their, old, liberties, in, the, 18th, century, advancing, agricultural, settlement, began, to, force, the, cossacks, to, give, up, their, traditional, nomadic, ways, and, adopt, new, forms, of, government, the, government, steadily, changed, the, entire, culture, of, the, cossacks, peter, the, great, increased, cossack, service, obligations, and, mobilized, their, forces, to, fight, in, far, off, wars, peter, began, establishing, non, cossack, troops, in, fortresses, along, the, yaik, river, in, 1734, construction, of, a, government, fortress, at, orenburg, gave, cossacks, a, subordinate, role, in, border, defense, 115, when, the, yaik, cossacks, sent, a, delegation, to, peter, with, their, grievances, peter, stripped, the, cossacks, of, their, autonomous, status, and, subordinated, them, to, the, war, college, rather, than, the, college, of, foreign, affairs, this, consolidated, the, cossacks, transition, from, border, patrol, to, military, servicemen, over, the, next, fifty, years, the, central, government, responded, to, cossack, grievances, with, arrests, floggings, and, exiles, 116, 117, under, catherine, the, great, beginning, in, 1762, the, russian, peasants, and, cossacks, again, faced, increased, taxation, heavy, military, conscription, and, grain, shortages, as, before, razin, s, rebellion, peter, iii, had, extended, freedom, to, former, church, serfs, freeing, them, from, obligations, and, payments, to, church, authorities, and, had, freed, other, peasants, from, serfdom, but, catherine, did, not, follow, through, on, these, reforms, in, 1767, the, empress, refused, to, accept, grievances, directly, from, the, peasantry, peasants, fled, once, again, to, the, lands, of, the, cossacks, in, particular, the, yaik, host, whose, people, were, committed, to, the, old, cossack, traditions, the, changing, government, also, burdened, the, cossacks, extending, its, reach, to, reform, cossack, traditions, among, ordinary, cossacks, hatred, of, the, elite, and, central, government, rose, in, 1772, a, six, month, open, rebellion, ensued, between, the, yaik, cossacks, and, the, central, government, 116, 117, yemelyan, pugachev, a, low, status, don, cossack, arrived, in, the, yaik, host, in, late, 1772, 117, there, he, claimed, to, be, peter, iii, playing, on, the, cossack, belief, that, peter, would, have, been, an, effective, ruler, but, for, his, assassination, in, a, plot, by, his, wife, catherine, ii, 120, many, yaik, cossacks, believed, pugachev, s, claim, although, those, closest, to, him, knew, the, truth, others, who, may, have, known, of, it, did, not, support, catherine, ii, due, to, her, disposal, of, peter, iii, and, also, spread, pugachev, s, claim, to, be, the, late, emperor, the, first, of, three, phases, of, pugachev, s, rebellion, began, in, september, 1773, 124, most, of, the, rebels, first, prisoners, were, cossacks, who, supported, the, elite, after, a, five, month, siege, of, orenburg, a, military, college, became, pugachev, s, headquarters, 126, pugachev, envisioned, a, cossack, tsardom, similar, to, razin, s, vision, of, a, united, cossack, republic, the, peasantry, across, russia, stirred, with, rumors, and, listened, to, the, manifestos, pugachev, issued, but, the, rebellion, soon, came, to, be, seen, as, an, inevitable, failure, the, don, cossacks, refused, to, help, the, final, phase, of, the, revolt, knowing, that, military, troops, were, closely, following, pugachev, after, lifting, the, siege, of, orenburg, and, following, his, flight, from, defeated, kazan, 127, 128, in, september, 1774, pugachev, s, own, cossack, lieutenants, turned, him, over, to, the, government, troops, 128, opposition, to, centralization, of, political, authority, led, the, cossacks, to, participate, in, pugachev, s, rebellion, 129, 130, after, their, defeat, the, cossack, elite, accepted, government, reforms, hoping, to, secure, status, within, the, nobility, the, ordinary, cossacks, had, to, follow, and, give, up, their, traditions, and, liberties, cossack, relations, with, the, tsardom, of, russia, were, varied, from, the, outset, at, times, they, supported, russian, military, operations, at, other, times, they, rebelled, against, the, central, power, after, one, such, uprising, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, russian, forces, destroyed, the, zaporozhian, host, many, of, the, cossacks, who, had, remained, loyal, to, the, russian, monarch, and, continued, their, service, later, moved, to, the, kuban, others, choosing, to, continue, a, mercenary, role, escaped, control, in, the, large, danube, delta, the, service, of, the, cossacks, in, the, napoleonic, wars, led, them, to, be, celebrated, as, russian, folk, heroes, and, throughout, the, 19th, century, a, powerful, myth, was, promoted, by, the, government, that, portrayed, the, cossacks, as, having, a, special, and, unique, bond, to, the, emperor, this, image, as, the, cossacks, as, the, ultra, patriotic, defenders, of, not, only, russia, but, also, of, the, house, of, romanov, was, embraced, by, many, ordinary, cossacks, making, them, into, a, force, for, conservatism, by, the, 19th, century, the, russian, empire, had, annexed, the, territory, of, the, cossack, hosts, and, controlled, them, by, providing, privileges, for, their, service, such, as, exemption, from, taxation, and, allowing, them, to, own, the, land, they, farmed, at, this, time, the, cossacks, served, as, military, forces, in, many, wars, conducted, by, the, russian, empire, cossacks, were, considered, excellent, for, scouting, and, reconnaissance, duties, and, for, ambushes, their, tactics, in, open, battle, were, generally, inferior, to, those, of, regular, soldiers, such, as, the, dragoons, in, 1840, the, cossack, hosts, included, the, don, black, sea, astrakhan, little, russia, azov, danube, ural, stavropol, mesherya, orenburg, siberian, tobolsk, tomsk, yeniseisk, irkutsk, sabaikal, yakutsk, and, tartar, voiskos, in, the, 1890s, the, ussuri, semirechensk, and, amur, cossacks, were, added, the, last, had, a, regiment, of, elite, mounted, rifles, increasingly, as, the, 19th, century, went, on, the, cossacks, served, as, a, mounted, para, military, police, force, in, all, of, the, various, provinces, of, the, vast, russian, empire, covering, a, territory, stretching, across, eurasia, from, what, is, now, modern, poland, to, the, banks, of, the, river, amur, that, formed, the, russian, chinese, border, the, police, forces, of, the, russian, empire, especially, in, rural, areas, were, undermanned, owing, to, the, low, wages, while, the, officers, of, the, imperial, russian, army, hated, having, their, units, deployed, to, put, down, domestic, unrest, which, was, viewed, as, destructive, towards, morale, and, possibly, a, source, of, mutiny, for, the, government, deploying, cossacks, as, a, para, military, police, force, was, the, best, solution, as, the, cossacks, were, viewed, as, one, of, the, social, groups, most, loyal, to, the, house, of, romanov, while, their, isolation, from, local, populations, was, felt, to, make, them, immune, to, revolutionary, appeals, traditionally, cossacks, were, viewed, in, russia, as, dashing, romantic, horsemen, with, a, rebellious, and, wild, aura, about, them, but, their, deployment, as, a, mounted, police, force, gave, them, a, novel, image, as, a, rather, violent, and, thuggish, police, force, fiercely, committed, to, upholding, the, social, order, this, change, from, an, irregular, cavalry, force, that, fought, against, the, enemies, of, russia, such, as, the, ottoman, empire, and, france, to, a, mounted, police, force, deployed, against, the, subjects, of, the, empire, caused, much, disquiet, within, the, cossack, hosts, as, it, was, contrary, to, the, heroic, ethos, of, frontier, warfare, that, the, cossacks, cherished, in, 1879, the, shah, of, iran, nasir, al, din, who, had, been, impressed, with, the, equestrian, skills, and, distinctive, uniforms, of, the, cossacks, while, on, a, visit, to, russia, the, previous, year, requested, that, the, emperor, alexander, ii, sent, some, cossacks, to, train, a, cossack, force, for, himself, alexander, granted, his, request, and, later, in, 1879, a, group, of, 9, cossacks, led, by, kuban, cossack, colonel, aleksey, domantovich, arrived, in, tehran, to, train, the, persian, cossack, brigade, the, shah, very, much, liked, the, colorful, uniforms, of, the, cossacks, and, domantovich, devised, uniforms, for, one, regiment, of, the, brigade, based, on, the, uniforms, of, the, kuban, cossack, host, and, another, regiment, had, its, uniform, based, on, the, terek, cossack, host, the, uniforms, of, the, cossacks, were, based, on, the, flamboyant, costumes, of, the, peoples, of, the, caucasus, and, what, in, russia, were, viewed, as, exotic, and, colorful, uniforms, were, viewed, in, iran, as, a, symbol, of, russianness, nasir, al, din, who, was, widely, regarded, as, a, deeply, superficial, and, shallow, man, was, not, interested, in, having, his, cossack, brigade, be, an, effective, military, force, and, for, him, merely, seeing, his, brigade, ride, before, him, while, dressed, in, their, brightly, colored, uniforms, was, quite, enough, over, the, shah, s, indifference, domantovich, and, his, cossacks, worked, hard, on, training, the, cossack, brigade, which, became, the, only, disciplined, unit, in, the, entire, persian, army, and, thus, of, considerable, importance, in, maintaining, the, shah, s, authority, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, cossack, communities, enjoyed, a, privileged, tax, free, status, in, the, russian, empire, although, they, had, a, 20, year, military, service, commitment, reduced, to, 18, years, from, 1909, they, were, on, active, duty, for, five, years, but, could, fulfill, their, remaining, obligation, with, the, reserves, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, russian, cossacks, numbered, 4, 5, million, they, were, organized, as, independent, regional, hosts, each, comprising, a, number, of, regiments, the, need, for, the, government, to, call, up, cossack, men, to, serve, either, with, the, army, or, a, mounted, police, force, caused, many, social, and, economic, problems, which, compounded, by, the, growing, impoverishment, the, communities, of, the, hosts, treated, as, a, separate, and, elite, community, by, the, tsar, the, cossacks, rewarded, his, government, with, strong, loyalty, his, administration, frequently, used, cossack, units, to, suppress, domestic, disorder, especially, during, the, russian, revolution, of, 1905, the, imperial, government, depended, heavily, on, the, perceived, reliability, of, the, cossacks, by, the, early, 20th, century, their, decentralized, communities, and, semi, feudal, military, service, were, coming, to, be, seen, as, obsolete, the, russian, army, command, which, had, worked, to, professionalize, its, forces, considered, the, cossacks, less, well, disciplined, trained, and, mounted, than, the, hussars, dragoons, and, lancers, of, the, regular, cavalry, the, cossack, qualities, of, initiative, and, rough, riding, skills, were, not, always, fully, appreciated, as, a, result, cossack, units, were, frequently, broken, up, into, small, detachments, for, use, as, scouts, messengers, or, picturesque, escorts, in, 1905, the, cossack, hosts, experienced, deep, mobilization, of, their, menfolk, amid, the, fighting, of, the, russo, japanese, war, in, manchuria, and, the, outbreak, of, revolution, within, the, russian, empire, like, other, peoples, of, the, empire, some, cossack, stanitsas, voiced, grievances, against, the, regime, by, defying, mobilization, orders, or, by, making, relatively, liberal, political, demands, but, these, infractions, were, eclipsed, by, the, prominent, role, of, cossack, detachments, in, stampeding, demonstrators, and, restoring, order, in, the, countryside, subsequently, the, wider, population, viewed, the, cossacks, as, instruments, of, reaction, tsar, nicholas, ii, reinforced, this, concept, by, issuing, new, charters, medals, and, bonuses, to, cossack, units, in, recognition, for, their, performance, during, the, revolution, of, 1905, 81, 82, in, september, 1906, reflecting, the, success, of, the, cossacks, in, putting, down, the, revolution, of, 1905, polkovnik, colonel, vladimir, liakhov, was, sent, to, iran, to, command, the, train, and, lead, the, persian, cossack, brigade, liakhov, had, led, a, cossack, squad, in, putting, down, the, revolution, in, the, caucasus, and, following, the, outbreak, of, the, constitutional, revolution, in, iran, he, was, sent, to, tehran, to, recognize, the, cossack, brigade, as, a, force, for, power, to, the, shah, the, persian, cossack, brigade, had, not, been, paid, for, months, and, proved, to, be, dubious, loyalty, to, the, house, of, qajar, during, the, constructional, revolution, while, its, russian, officers, were, uncertain, what, to, do, with, russia, itself, in, revolution, liakhov, a, vigorous, able, and, reactionary, officer, firmly, committed, to, upholding, absolute, monarchies, whatever, in, russia, or, iran, transformed, the, persian, cossack, brigade, into, a, mounted, para, military, police, force, rather, than, as, a, combat, force, liakhov, was, close, to, the, new, shah, mohammed, ali, who, ascended, to, the, peacock, throne, in, january, 1907, and, it, was, due, to, the, shah, s, patronage, that, liakhov, transformed, the, persian, cossack, brigade, into, the, main, bulwark, of, the, iranian, state, in, june, 1908, liakhov, led, the, cossack, brigade, in, bombarding, the, majlis, parliament, while, being, appointed, military, governor, of, tehran, as, the, shah, attempted, to, do, away, with, the, constitution, his, father, had, been, forced, to, grant, in, 1906, reza, khan, who, became, the, first, iranian, to, command, the, cossack, brigade, led, the, coup, d, tat, in, 1921, and, in, 1925, deposed, the, qajars, to, found, a, new, dynasty, after, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, august, 1914, cossacks, became, a, key, component, in, the, cavalry, of, the, imperial, russian, army, the, mounted, cossacks, made, up, 38, regiments, plus, some, infantry, battalions, and, 52, horse, artillery, batteries, initially, each, russian, cavalry, division, included, a, regiment, of, cossacks, in, addition, to, regular, units, of, hussars, lancers, and, dragoons, by, 1916, the, cossacks, wartime, strength, had, expanded, to, 160, regiments, plus, 176, independent, sotnias, squadrons, employed, as, detached, units, the, importance, of, cavalry, in, the, frontlines, faded, after, the, opening, phase, of, the, war, settled, into, a, stalemate, during, the, remainder, of, the, war, cossack, units, were, dismounted, to, fight, in, trenches, held, in, reserve, to, exploit, a, rare, breakthrough, or, assigned, various, duties, in, the, rear, those, duties, included, rounding, up, deserters, providing, escorts, to, war, prisoners, and, razing, villages, and, farms, in, accordance, with, russia, s, scorched, earth, policy, at, the, outbreak, of, the, disorder, on, 8, march, 1917, that, led, to, the, overthrow, of, the, tsarist, regime, approximately, 3, 200, cossacks, from, the, don, kuban, and, terek, hosts, were, stationed, in, petrograd, although, they, comprised, only, a, fraction, of, the, 300, 000, troops, in, the, proximity, of, the, russian, capital, their, general, defection, on, the, second, day, of, unrest, 10, march, enthused, raucous, crowds, and, stunned, the, authorities, and, remaining, loyal, units, 212, 215, in, the, aftermath, of, the, february, revolution, the, cossacks, hosts, were, authorized, by, the, war, ministry, of, the, russian, provisional, government, to, overhaul, their, administrations, cossack, assemblies, known, as, krugs, or, in, the, case, of, the, kuban, cossacks, a, rada, were, organized, at, regional, level, to, elect, atamans, and, pass, resolutions, at, national, level, an, all, cossack, congress, was, convened, in, petrograd, this, congress, formed, the, union, of, cossack, hosts, ostensibly, to, represent, the, interests, of, cossacks, across, russia, during, the, course, of, 1917, the, nascent, cossack, governments, formed, by, the, krugs, and, atamans, increasingly, challenged, the, provisional, government, s, authority, in, the, borderlands, the, various, cossack, governments, themselves, faced, rivals, in, the, form, of, national, councils, organized, by, neighboring, minorities, and, of, soviets, and, zemstvos, formed, by, non, cossack, russians, especially, the, so, called, outlanders, who, had, immigrated, to, cossack, lands, soon, after, the, bolsheviks, seized, power, in, petrograd, on, 7, 8, november, 1917, most, cossack, atamans, and, their, government, refused, to, recognize, the, legitimacy, of, the, new, regime, the, don, cossack, ataman, aleksey, kaledin, went, as, far, as, to, invite, opponents, of, the, bolsheviks, to, the, don, host, but, the, position, of, many, cossack, governments, was, far, from, secure, even, within, the, boundaries, of, their, hosts, in, some, areas, soviets, formed, by, outlanders, and, soldiers, rivaled, the, cossack, government, and, ethnic, minorities, also, tried, to, acquire, a, measure, of, self, rule, even, the, cossack, communities, themselves, were, divided, as, the, atamans, tended, to, represent, the, interests, of, prosperous, landowners, and, the, officer, corps, poorer, cossacks, and, those, serving, in, the, army, were, susceptible, to, bolshevik, propaganda, promising, to, spare, toiling, cossacks, from, land, appropriation, 50, 51, the, unwillingness, of, rank, and, file, cossacks, to, vigorously, defend, the, cossack, government, enabled, the, red, army, to, occupy, the, vast, majority, of, cossack, lands, by, late, spring, of, 1918, but, the, bolsheviks, policy, of, requisitioning, grain, and, foodstuffs, from, the, countryside, to, supply, russia, s, starving, northern, cities, quickly, fomented, revolt, among, cossack, communities, these, cossack, rebels, elected, new, atamans, and, made, common, cause, with, other, anticommunist, forces, such, as, the, volunteer, army, in, south, russia, subsequently, the, cossack, homelands, became, bases, for, the, white, movement, during, the, russian, civil, war, 53, 63, throughout, the, civil, war, cossacks, sometimes, fought, as, an, independent, ally, and, other, times, as, an, auxiliary, of, white, armies, in, south, russia, the, armed, forces, of, south, russia, afsr, under, general, anton, denikin, relied, heavily, on, conscripts, from, the, don, and, kuban, cossack, hosts, to, fill, their, ranks, through, the, cossacks, the, white, armies, acquired, experienced, skilled, horsemen, that, the, red, army, was, unable, to, match, until, late, in, the, conflict, but, the, relationship, between, cossack, governments, and, the, white, leaders, was, frequently, acrimonious, cossack, units, were, often, ill, disciplined, and, prone, to, bouts, of, looting, and, violence, that, caused, the, peasantry, to, resent, the, whites, 110, 139, in, ukraine, kuban, and, terek, cossack, squadrons, carried, out, pogroms, against, jews, despite, orders, from, denikin, condemning, such, activity, 127, 128, kuban, cossack, politicians, wanting, a, semi, independent, state, of, their, own, frequently, agitated, against, the, afsr, command, 112, 120, in, the, russian, far, east, anticommunist, transbaikal, and, ussuri, cossacks, undermined, the, rear, of, siberia, s, white, armies, by, disrupting, traffic, on, the, trans, siberian, railway, and, engaging, in, acts, of, banditry, that, fueled, a, potent, insurgency, in, that, region, as, the, red, army, gained, the, initiative, in, the, civil, war, during, late, 1919, and, early, 1920, cossack, soldiers, their, families, and, sometimes, entire, stanitsas, retreated, with, the, whites, some, continued, to, fight, with, the, whites, in, the, conflict, s, waning, stages, in, crimea, and, the, russian, far, east, as, many, as, 80, 000, 100, 000, cossacks, eventually, joined, the, defeated, whites, in, exile, although, the, cossacks, were, sometimes, portrayed, by, bolsheviks, and, later, migr, historians, as, a, monolithic, counterrevolutionary, group, during, the, civil, war, there, were, many, cossacks, who, fought, with, the, red, army, throughout, the, conflict, many, poorer, cossack, communities, also, remained, receptive, to, the, communist, message, in, late, 1918, and, early, 1919, widespread, desertion, and, defection, among, don, ural, and, orenburg, cossacks, fighting, with, the, whites, produced, a, military, crisis, that, was, exploited, by, the, red, army, in, those, sectors, 50, 51, 113, 117, after, the, main, white, armies, were, defeated, in, early, 1920, many, cossack, soldiers, switched, their, allegiance, to, the, bolsheviks, and, fought, with, the, red, army, against, the, poles, and, in, other, operations, on, 22, december, 1917, the, council, of, people, s, commissars, effectively, abolished, the, cossack, estate, by, ending, their, military, service, requirements, and, privileges, 230, after, the, widespread, anticommunist, rebellions, among, cossacks, in, 1918, the, soviet, regime, s, approach, hardened, in, early, 1919, when, the, red, army, occupied, cossack, districts, in, the, urals, and, northern, don, the, bolsheviks, embarked, on, a, policy, of, de, cossackization, intended, to, end, the, cossack, threat, to, the, soviet, regime, this, was, pursued, through, resettlement, widespread, executions, of, cossack, veterans, from, the, white, armies, and, favoring, the, outlanders, within, the, cossack, hosts, ultimately, the, de, cossackization, campaign, led, to, a, renewed, rebellion, among, cossacks, in, soviet, occupied, districts, and, produced, a, new, round, of, setbacks, for, the, red, army, in, 1919, 246, 251, when, the, victorious, red, army, again, occupied, cossack, districts, in, late, 1919, and, 1920, the, soviet, regime, did, not, officially, reauthorize, the, implementation, of, de, cossackization, there, is, however, disagreement, among, historians, as, to, the, degree, of, cossack, s, persecution, by, the, soviet, regime, for, example, the, cossack, hosts, were, broken, up, among, new, provinces, or, autonomous, republics, some, cossacks, especially, in, areas, of, the, former, terek, host, were, resettled, so, their, lands, could, be, turned, over, to, natives, displaced, from, them, during, the, initial, russian, and, cossack, colonization, of, the, area, at, the, local, level, the, stereotype, that, cossacks, were, inherent, counterrevolutionaries, likely, persisted, among, some, communist, officials, causing, them, to, target, or, discriminate, against, cossacks, despite, orders, from, moscow, to, focus, on, class, enemies, among, cossacks, rather, than, the, cossack, people, in, general, 260, 264, rebellions, in, the, former, cossack, territories, erupted, occasionally, during, the, interwar, period, in, 1920, 1921, disgruntlement, with, continued, soviet, grain, requisitioning, activities, provoked, a, series, of, revolts, among, cossack, and, outlander, communities, in, south, russia, the, former, cossack, territories, of, south, russia, and, the, urals, also, experienced, a, devastating, famine, in, 1921, 1922, in, 1932,
