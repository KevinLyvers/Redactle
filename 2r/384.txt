whether, the, ming, dynasty, had, sovereignty, over, tibet, some, believe, it, was, a, relationship, of, loose, suzerainty, that, was, largely, cut, off, when, the, jiajing, emperor, r, 1521, 67, persecuted, buddhism, in, favor, of, daoism, at, court, others, argue, that, the, significant, religious, nature, of, the, relationship, with, tibetan, lamas, is, underrepresented, in, modern,

his, wife, mother, and, courtiers, zhu, di, assumed, the, throne, as, the, yongle, emperor, r, 1402, 24, his, reign, is, universally, viewed, by, scholars, as, a, second, founding, of, the, ming, dynasty, since, he, reversed, many, of, his, father, s, policies, yongle, demoted, nanjing, to, a, secondary, capital, and, in, 1403, announced, the, new, capital, of, china, was, to, be, at, his,

became, an, influential, base, for, highly, placed, eunuchs, and, continued, in, a, somewhat, diminished, role, during, the, qing, dynasty, during, the, last, years, of, the, wanli, era, and, those, of, his, two, successors, an, economic, crisis, developed, that, was, centered, on, a, sudden, widespread, lack, of, the, empire, s, chief, medium, of, exchange, silver, the, portuguese, first, established, trade, with, china, in, 1516, following, the, ming, emperor, s, decision, to, ban, direct, trade, with, japan, portuguese, traders, acted, as, an, intermediary, between, china, and, japan, by, buying, chinese, silks, from, china, and, selling, it, to, japan, for, silver, after, some, initial, hostilities, gained, consent, from, the, ming, court, in, 1557, to, settle, macau, as, their, permanent, trade, base, in, china, their, role, in, providing, silver, was, gradually, surpassed, by, the, spanish, while, even, the, dutch, challenged, them, for, control, of, this, trade, philip, iv, of, spain, r, 1621, 1665, began, cracking, down, on, illegal, smuggling, of, silver, from, new, spain, and, peru, across, the, pacific, through, the, philippines, towards, china, in,

could, fetch, half, an, ounce, and, by, 1643, only, one, third, of, an, ounce, for, peasants, this, meant, economic, disaster, since, they, paid, taxes, in, silver, while, conducting, local, trade, and, crop, sales, in, copper, historians, have, debated, the, validity, of, the, theory, that, silver, shortages, caused, the, downfall, of, the, ming, dynasty, famines, became, common, in, northern, china, in, the, early, 17th, century, because, of, unusually, dry, and, cold, weather, that, shortened, the, growing, season, effects, of, a, larger, ecological, event, now, known, as, the, little,

of, ming, resistance, however, there, were, several, pretenders, for, the, ming, throne, and, their, forces, were, divided, these, scattered, ming, remnants, in, southern, china, after, 1644, were, collectively, designated, by, 19th, century, historians, as, the, southern, ming, each, bastion, of, resistance, was, individually, defeated, by, the, qing, until, 1662, when, the, last, southern, ming, emperor, zhu, youlang, the, yongli, emperor, was, captured, and, executed, despite, the, ming, defeat, smaller, loyalist, movements, continued, until, the, proclamation, of, the, republic, of, china, described, as, one, of, the, greatest, eras, of, orderly, government, and, social, stability, in, human, history, by, edwin, o, reischauer, john, k, fairbank, and, albert, m, craig, the, ming, emperors, took, over, the, provincial, administration, system, of, the, yuan, dynasty, and, the, thirteen, ming, provinces, are, the, precursors, of, the, modern, provinces, throughout, the, song, dynasty, the, largest, political, division, was, the, circuit, lu, however, after, the, jurchen, invasion, in, 1127, the, song, court, established, four, semi, autonomous, regional, command, systems, based, on, territorial, and, military, units, with, a, detached, service, secretariat, that, would, become, the, provincial, administrations, of, the, yuan, ming, and, qing, dynasties, copied, on, the, yuan, model, the, ming, provincial, bureaucracy, contained, three, commissions, one, civil, one, military, and, one, for, surveillance, below, the, level, of, the, province, sheng, were, prefectures, fu, operating, under, a, prefect, zhifu, followed, by, subprefectures, zhou, under, a, subprefect, the, lowest, unit, was, the, county, xian, overseen, by, a, magistrate, besides, the, provinces, there, were, also, two, large, areas, that, belonged, to, no, province, but, were, metropolitan, areas, jing, attached, to, nanjing, and, beijing, departing, from, the, main, central, administrative, system, generally, known, as, the, three, departments, and, six, ministries, system, which, was, instituted, by, various, dynasties, since, late, han, 202, bce, 220, ce, the, ming, administration, had, only, one, department, the, secretariat, that, controlled, the, six, ministries, following, the, execution, of, the, chancellor, hu, weiyong, in, 1380, the, hongwu, emperor, abolished, the, secretariat, the, censorate, and, the, chief, military, commission, and, personally, took, charge, of, the, six, ministries, and, the, regional, five, military, commissions, thus, a, whole, level, of, administration, was, cut, out, and, only, partially, rebuilt, by, subsequent, rulers, the, grand, secretariat, at, the, beginning, a, secretarial, institution, that, assisted, the, emperor, with, administrative, paperwork, was, instituted, but, without, employing, grand, counselors, or, chancellors, the, hongwu, emperor, sent, his, heir, apparent, to, shaanxi, in, 1391, to, tour, and, soothe, xunfu, the, region, in, 1421, the, yongle, emperor, commissioned, 26, officials, to, travel, the, empire, and, uphold, similar, investigatory, and, patrimonial, duties, by, 1430, these, xunfu, assignments, became, institutionalized, as, grand, coordinators, hence, the, censorate, was, reinstalled, and, first, staffed, with, investigating, censors, later, with, censors, in, chief, by, 1453, the, grand, coordinators, were, granted, the, title, vice, censor, in, chief, or, assistant, censor, in, chief, and, were, allowed, direct, access, to, the, emperor, as, in, prior, dynasties, the, provincial, administrations, were, monitored, by, a, travelling, inspector, from, the, censorate, censors, had, the, power, to, impeach, officials, on, an, irregular, basis, unlike, the, senior, officials, who, were, to, do, so, only, in, triennial, evaluations, of, junior, officials, although, decentralization, of, state, power, within, the, provinces, occurred, in, the, early, ming, the, trend, of, central, government, officials, delegated, to, the, provinces, as, virtual, provincial, governors, began, in, the, 1420s, by, the, late, ming, dynasty, there, were, central, government, officials, delegated, to, two, or, more, provinces, as, supreme, commanders, and, viceroys, a, system, which, reined, in, the, power, and, influence, of, the, military, by, the, civil, establishment, governmental, institutions, in, china, conformed, to, a, similar, pattern, for, some, two, thousand, years, but, each, dynasty, installed, special, offices, and, bureaus, reflecting, its, own, particular, interests, the, ming, administration, utilized, grand, secretaries, to, assist, the, emperor, handling, paperwork, under, the, reign, of, the, yongle, emperor, and, later, appointed, as, top, officials, of, agencies, and, grand, preceptor, a, top, ranking, non, functional, civil, service, post, under, the, hongxi, emperor, r, 1424, 25, the, grand, secretariat, drew, its, members, from, the, hanlin, academy, and, were, considered, part, of, the, imperial, authority, not, the, ministerial, one, hence, being, at, odds, with, both, the, emperor, and, ministers, at, times, the, secretariat, operated, as, a, coordinating, agency, whereas, the, six, ministries, personnel, revenue, rites, war, justice, and, public, works, were, direct, administrative, organs, of, the, state, the, imperial, household, was, staffed, almost, entirely, by, eunuchs, and, ladies, with, their, own, bureaus, female, servants, were, organized, into, the, bureau, of, palace, attendance, bureau, of, ceremonies, bureau, of, apparel, bureau, of, foodstuffs, bureau, of, the, bedchamber, bureau, of, handicrafts, and, office, of, staff, surveillance, starting, in, the, 1420s, eunuchs, began, taking, over, these, ladies, positions, until, only, the, bureau, of, apparel, with, its, four, subsidiary, offices, remained, hongwu, had, his, eunuchs, organized, into, the, directorate, of, palace, attendants, but, as, eunuch, power, at, court, increased, so, did, their, administrative, offices, with, eventual, twelve, directorates, four, offices, and, eight, bureaus, the, dynasty, had, a, vast, imperial, household, staffed, with, thousands, of, eunuchs, who, were, headed, by, the, directorate, of, palace, attendants, the, eunuchs, were, divided, into, different, directorates, in, charge, of, staff, surveillance, ceremonial, rites, food, utensils, documents, stables, seals, apparel, and, so, on, the, offices, were, in, charge, of, providing, fuel, music, paper, and, baths, the, bureaus, were, in, charge, of, weapons, silverwork, laundering, headgear, bronze, work, textile, manufacture, wineries, and, gardens, at, times, the, most, influential, eunuch, in, the, directorate, of, ceremonial, acted, as, a, de, facto, dictator, over, the, state, although, the, imperial, household, was, staffed, mostly, by, eunuchs, and, palace, ladies, there, was, a, civil, service, office, called, the, seal, office, which, cooperated, with, eunuch, agencies, in, maintaining, imperial, seals, tallies, and, stamps, there, were, also, civil, service, offices, to, oversee, the, affairs, of, imperial, princes, the, hongwu, emperor, from, 1373, to, 1384, staffed, his, bureaus, with, officials, gathered, through, recommendations, only, after, that, the, scholar, officials, who, populated, the, many, ranks, of, bureaucracy, were, recruited, through, a, rigorous, examination, system, that, was, initially, established, by, the, sui, dynasty, 581, 618, theoretically, the, system, of, exams, allowed, anyone, to, join, the, ranks, of, imperial, officials, although, it, was, frowned, upon, for, merchants, to, join, in, reality, the, time, and, funding, needed, to, support, the, study, in, preparation, for, the, exam, generally, limited, participants, to, those, already, coming, from, the, landholding, class, however, the, government, did, exact, provincial, quotas, while, drafting, officials, this, was, an, effort, to, curb, monopolization, of, power, by, landholding, gentry, who, came, from, the, most, prosperous, regions, where, education, was, the, most, advanced, the, expansion, of, the, printing, industry, since, song, times, enhanced, the, spread, of, knowledge, and, number, of, potential, exam, candidates, throughout, the, provinces, for, young, schoolchildren, there, were, printed, multiplication, tables, and, primers, for, elementary, vocabulary, for, adult, examination, candidates, there, were, mass, produced, inexpensive, volumes, of, confucian, classics, and, successful, examination, answers, as, in, earlier, periods, the, focus, of, the, examination, was, classical, confucian, texts, while, the, bulk, of, test, material, centered, on, the, four, books, outlined, by, zhu, xi, in, the, 12th, century, ming, era, examinations, were, perhaps, more, difficult, to, pass, since, the, 1487, requirement, of, completing, the, eight, legged, essay, a, departure, from, basing, essays, off, progressing, literary, trends, the, exams, increased, in, difficulty, as, the, student, progressed, from, the, local, level, and, appropriate, titles, were, accordingly, awarded, successful, applicants, officials, were, classified, in, nine, hierarchic, grades, each, grade, divided, into, two, degrees, with, ranging, salaries, nominally, paid, in, piculs, of, rice, according, to, their, rank, while, provincial, graduates, who, were, appointed, to, office, were, immediately, assigned, to, low, ranking, posts, like, the, county, graduates, those, who, passed, the, palace, examination, were, awarded, a, jinshi, presented, scholar, degree, and, assured, a, high, level, position, in, 276, years, of, ming, rule, and, ninety, palace, examinations, the, number, of, doctoral, degrees, granted, by, passing, the, palace, examinations, was, 24, 874, ebrey, states, that, there, were, only, two, to, four, thousand, of, these, jinshi, at, any, given, time, on, the, order, of, one, out, of, 10, 000, adult, males, this, was, in, comparison, to, the, 100, 000, shengyuan, government, students, the, lowest, tier, of, graduates, by, the, 16th, century, the, maximum, tenure, in, office, was, nine, years, but, every, three, years, officials, were, graded, on, their, performance, by, senior, officials, if, they, were, graded, as, superior, then, they, were, promoted, if, graded, adequate, then, they, retained, their, ranks, and, if, graded, inadequate, they, were, demoted, one, rank, in, extreme, cases, officials, would, be, dismissed, or, punished, only, capital, officials, of, grade, 4, and, above, were, exempt, from, the, scrutiny, of, recorded, evaluation, although, they, were, expected, to, confess, any, of, their, faults, there, were, over, 4, 000, school, instructors, in, county, and, prefectural, schools, who, were, subject, to, evaluations, every, nine, years, the, chief, instructor, on, the, prefectural, level, was, classified, as, equal, to, a, second, grade, county, graduate, the, supervisorate, of, imperial, instruction, oversaw, the, education, of, the, heir, apparent, to, the, throne, this, office, was, headed, by, a, grand, supervisor, of, instruction, who, was, ranked, as, first, class, of, grade, three, historians, debate, whether, the, examination, system, expanded, or, contracted, upward, social, mobility, on, the, one, hand, the, exams, were, graded, without, regard, to, a, candidate, s, social, background, and, were, theoretically, open, to, everyone, in, actual, practice, the, successful, candidates, had, years, of, a, very, expensive, sophisticated, tutoring, of, the, sort, that, wealthy, gentry, families, specialized, in, providing, their, talented, sons, in, practice, 90, percent, of, the, population, was, ineligible, due, to, lack, of, education, but, the, upper, 10, percent, had, equal, chances, for, moving, to, the, top, to, be, successful, young, men, had, to, have, extensive, expensive, training, in, classical, chinese, the, use, of, mandarin, in, spoken, conversation, calligraphy, and, had, to, master, the, intricate, poetic, requirements, of, the, eight, legged, essay, not, only, did, the, traditional, gentry, dominated, the, system, they, also, learned, that, conservatism, and, resistance, to, new, ideas, was, the, path, to, success, for, centuries, critics, had, pointed, out, these, problems, but, the, examination, system, only, became, more, abstract, and, less, relevant, to, the, needs, of, china, the, consensus, of, scholars, is, that, the, eight, legged, essay, can, be, blamed, as, a, major, cause, of, china, s, cultural, stagnation, and, economic, backwardness, however, benjamin, ellman, argues, there, were, some, positive, features, since, the, essay, form, was, capable, of, fostering, abstract, thinking, persuasiveness, and, prosodic, form, and, that, its, elaborate, structure, discouraged, a, wandering, unfocused, narrative, scholar, officials, who, entered, civil, service, through, examinations, acted, as, executive, officials, to, a, much, larger, body, of, non, ranked, personnel, called, lesser, functionaries, they, outnumbered, officials, by, four, to, one, charles, hucker, estimates, that, they, were, perhaps, as, many, as, 100, 000, throughout, the, empire, these, lesser, functionaries, performed, clerical, and, technical, tasks, for, government, agencies, yet, they, should, not, be, confused, with, lowly, lictors, runners, and, bearers, lesser, functionaries, were, given, periodic, merit, evaluations, like, officials, and, after, nine, years, of, service, might, be, accepted, into, a, low, civil, service, rank, the, one, great, advantage, of, the, lesser, functionaries, over, officials, was, that, officials, were, periodically, rotated, and, assigned, to, different, regional, posts, and, had, to, rely, on, the, good, service, and, cooperation, of, the, local, lesser, functionaries, eunuchs, gained, unprecedented, power, over, state, affairs, during, the, ming, dynasty, one, of, the, most, effective, means, of, control, was, the, secret, service, stationed, in, what, was, called, the, eastern, depot, at, the, beginning, of, the, dynasty, later, the, western, depot, this, secret, service, was, overseen, by, the, directorate, of, ceremonial, hence, this, state, organ, s, often, totalitarian, affiliation, eunuchs, had, ranks, that, were, equivalent, to, civil, service, ranks, only, theirs, had, four, grades, instead, of, nine, descendants, of, the, first, ming, emperor, were, made, princes, and, given, typically, nominal, military, commands, annual, stipends, and, large, estates, the, title, used, was, king, w, ng, but, unlike, the, princes, in, the, han, and, jin, dynasties, these, estates, were, not, feudatories, the, princes, did, not, serve, any, administrative, function, and, they, partook, in, military, affairs, only, during, the, reigns, of, the, first, two, emperors, the, rebellion, of, the, prince, of, yan, was, justified, in, part, as, upholding, the, rights, of, the, princes, but, once, the, yongle, emperor, was, enthroned, he, continued, his, nephew, s, policy, of, disarming, his, brothers, and, moved, their, fiefs, away, from, the, militarized, northern, border, although, princes, served, no, organ, of, state, administration, the, princes, consorts, of, the, imperial, princesses, and, ennobled, relatives, did, staff, the, imperial, clan, court, which, supervised, the, imperial, genealogy, like, scholar, officials, military, generals, were, ranked, in, a, hierarchic, grading, system, and, were, given, merit, evaluations, every, five, years, as, opposed, to, three, years, for, officials, however, military, officers, had, less, prestige, than, officials, this, was, due, to, their, hereditary, service, instead, of, solely, merit, based, and, confucian, values, that, dictated, those, who, chose, the, profession, of, violence, wu, over, the, cultured, pursuits, of, knowledge, wen, although, seen, as, less, prestigious, military, officers, were, not, excluded, from, taking, civil, service, examinations, and, after, 1478, the, military, even, held, their, own, examinations, to, test, military, skills, in, addition, to, taking, over, the, established, bureaucratic, structure, from, the, yuan, period, the, ming, emperors, established, the, new, post, of, the, travelling, military, inspector, in, the, early, half, of, the, dynasty, men, of, noble, lineage, dominated, the,

poetry, music, and, chinese, opera, of, various, types, flourished, during, the, ming, dynasty, especially, in, the, economically, prosperous, lower, yangzi, valley, although, short, fiction, had, been, popular, as, far, back, as, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, and, the, works, of, contemporaneous, authors, such, as, xu, guangqi, xu, xiake, and, song, yingxing, were, often, technical, and, encyclopedic, the, most, striking, literary, development, was, the, vernacular, novel, while, the, gentry, elite, were, educated, enough, to, fully, comprehend, the, language, of, classical, chinese, those, with, rudimentary, education, such, as, women, in, educated, families, merchants, and, shop, clerks, became, a, large, potential, audience, for, literature, and, performing, arts, that, employed, vernacular, chinese, literati, scholars, edited, or, developed, major, chinese, novels, into, mature, form, in, this, period, such, as, water, margin, and, journey, to, the, west, jin, ping, mei, published, in, 1610, although, incorporating, earlier, material, marks, the, trend, toward, independent, composition, and, concern, with, psychology, in, the, later, years, of, the, dynasty, feng, menglong, and, ling, mengchu, innovated, with, vernacular, short, fiction, theater, scripts, were, equally, imaginative, the, most, famous, the, peony, pavilion, was, written, by, tang, xianzu, 1550, 1616, with, its, first, performance, at, the, pavilion, of, prince, teng, in, 1598, informal, essay, and, travel, writing, was, another, highlight, xu, xiake, 1587, 1641, a, travel, literature, author, published, his, travel, diaries, in, 404, 000, written, characters, with, information, on, everything, from, local, geography, to, mineralogy, the, first, reference, to, the, publishing, of, private, newspapers, in, beijing, was, in, 1582, by, 1638, the, peking, gazette, switched, from, using, woodblock, print, to, movable, type, printing, the, new, literary, field, of, the, moral, guide, to, business, ethics, was, developed, during, the, late, ming, period, for, the, readership, of, the, merchant, class, in, contrast, to, xu, xiake, who, focused, on, technical, aspects, in, his, travel, literature, the, chinese, poet, and, official, yuan, hongdao, 1568, 1610, used, travel, literature, to, express, his, desires, for, individualism, as, well, as, autonomy, from, and, frustration, with, confucian, court, politics, yuan, desired, to, free, himself, from, the, ethical, compromises, that, were, inseparable, from, the, career, of, a, scholar, official, this, anti, official, sentiment, in, yuan, s, travel, literature, and, poetry, was, actually, following, in, the, tradition, of, the, song, dynasty, poet, and, official, su, shi, 1037, 1101, yuan, hongdao, and, his, two, brothers, yuan, zongdao, 1560, 1600, and, yuan, zhongdao, 1570, 1623, were, the, founders, of, the, gong, an, school, of, letters, this, highly, individualistic, school, of, poetry, and, prose, was, criticized, by, the, confucian, establishment, for, its, association, with, intense, sensual, lyricism, which, was, also, apparent, in, ming, vernacular, novels, such, as, the, jin, ping, mei, yet, even, gentry, and, scholar, officials, were, affected, by, the, new, popular, romantic, literature, seeking, gejis, as, soulmates, to, re, enact, the, heroic, love, stories, that, arranged, marriages, often, could, not, provide, or, accommodate, during, the, ming, dynasty, some, gentry, dated, well, educated, gejis, outside, of, marriage, and, the, concubine, system, g, j, culture, of, the, ming, dynasty, reshaped, the, purely, sexual, relationship, with, prostitutes, into, a, cultural, relationship, and, men, could, even, become, friends, with, like, minded, gejis, famous,

styles, and, complexity, in, painting, achieved, by, their, song, and, yuan, predecessors, but, added, techniques, and, styles, well, known, ming, artists, could, make, a, living, simply, by, painting, due, to, the, high, prices, they, demanded, for, their, artworks, and, the, great, demand, by, the, highly, cultured, community, to, collect, precious, works, of, art, the, artist, qiu,

gathered, an, entourage, of, followers, some, who, were, amateurs, who, painted, while, pursuing, an, official, career, and, others, who, were, full, time, painters, the, period, was, also, renowned, for, ceramics, and, porcelains, the, major, production, center, for, porcelain, was, the, imperial, kilns, at, jingdezhen, in, jiangxi, province, most, famous, in, the, period, for, blue, and, white, porcelain, but, also, producing, other, styles, the, dehua, porcelain, factories, in, fujian, catered, to, european, tastes, by, creating, chinese, export, porcelain, by, the, late, 16th, century, individual, potters, also, became, known, such, as, he, chaozong, who, became, famous, in, the, early, 17th, century, for, his, style, of, white, porcelain, sculpture, in, the, ceramic, trade, in, asia, chuimei, ho, estimates, that, about, 16, of, late, ming, era, chinese, ceramic, exports, were, sent, to, europe, while, the, rest, were, destined, for, japan, and, south, east, asia, carved, designs, in, lacquerware, and, designs, glazed, onto, porcelain, wares, displayed, intricate, scenes, similar, in, complexity, to, those, in, painting, these, items, could, be, found, in, the, homes, of, the, wealthy, alongside, embroidered, silks, and, wares, in, jade, ivory, and, cloisonn, the, houses, of, the, rich, were, also, furnished, with, rosewood, furniture, and, feathery, latticework, the, writing, materials, in, a, scholar, s, private, study, including, elaborately, carved, brush, holders, made, of, stone, or, wood, were, designed, and, arranged, ritually, to, give, an, aesthetic, appeal, connoisseurship, in, the, late, ming, period, centered, on, these, items, of, refined, artistic, taste, which, provided, work, for, art, dealers, and, even, underground, scammers, who, themselves, made, imitations, and, false, attributions, the, jesuit, matteo, ricci, while, staying, in, nanjing, wrote, that, chinese, scam, artists, were, ingenious, at, making, forgeries, and, huge, profits, however, there, were, guides, to, help, the, wary, new, connoisseur, liu, tong, died, 1637, wrote, a, book, printed, in, 1635, that, told, his, readers, how, to, spot, fake, and, authentic, pieces, of, art, he, revealed, that, a, xuande, era, 1426, 1435, bronze, work, could, be, authenticated, by, judging, its, sheen, porcelain, wares, from, the, yongle, era, 1402, 1424, could, be, judged, authentic, by, their, thickness, the, dominant, religious, beliefs, during, the, ming, dynasty, were, the, various, forms, of, chinese, folk, religion, and, the, three, teachings, confucianism, taoism, and, buddhism, the, yuan, supported, tibetan, lamas, fell, from, favor, and, the, early, ming, emperors, particularly, favored, taoism, granting, its, practitioners, many, positions, in, the, state, s, ritual, offices, the, hongwu, emperor, curtailed, the, cosmopolitan, culture, of, the, mongol, yuan, dynasty, and, the, prolific, prince, of, ning, zhu, quan, even, composed, one, encyclopedia, attacking, buddhism, as, a, foreign, mourning, cult, deleterious, to, the, state, and, another, encyclopedia, that, subsequently, joined, the, taoist, canon, the, yongle, emperor, and, later, emperors, strongly, patronised, tibetan, buddhism, by, supporting, construction, printing, of, sutras, ceremonies, etc, to, seek, legitimacy, among, foreign, audiences, yongle, tried, to, portray, himself, as, a, buddhist, ideal, king, a, cakravartin, there, is, evidence, that, this, portrayal, was, successful, in, persuading, foreign, audiences, islam, was, also, well, established, throughout, china, with, a, history, said, to, have, begun, with, sa, d, ibn, abi, waqqas, during, the, tang, dynasty, and, strong, official, support, during, the, yuan, although, the, ming, sharply, curtailed, this, support, there, were, still, several, prominent, muslim, figures, early, on, including, the, yongle, emperor, s, powerful, eunuch, zheng, he, the, hongwu, emperor, s, generals, chang, yuqun, lan, yu, ding, dexing, and, mu, ying, have, also, been, identified, as, muslim, by, hui, scholars, though, this, is, doubted, by, non, muslim, sources, regardless, the, presence, of, muslims, in, the, armies, that, drove, the, mongols, northwards, caused, a, gradual, shift, in, the, chinese, perception, of, muslims, transitioning, from, foreigners, to, familiar, strangers, the, hongwu, emperor, wrote, a, 100, character, praise, of, islam, and, the, prophet, muhammad, the, ming, emperors, strongly, sponsored, the, construction, of, mosques, and, granted, generous, liberties, for, the, practice, of, islam, the, advent, of, the, ming, was, initially, devastating, to, christianity, in, his, first, year, the, hongwu, emperor, declared, the, eighty, year, old, franciscan, missions, among, the, yuan, heterodox, and, illegal, the, centuries, old, church, of, the, east, in, china, also, disappeared, during, the, later, ming, a, new, wave, of, christian, missionaries, arrived, particularly, jesuits, who, employed, new, western, science, and, technology, in, their, arguments, for, conversion, they, were, educated, in, chinese, language, and, culture, at, st, paul, s, college, on, macau, after, its, founding, in, 1579, the, most, influential, was, matteo, ricci, whose, map, of, the, myriad, countries, of, the, world, upended, traditional, geography, throughout, east, asia, and, whose, work, with, the, convert, xu, guangqi, led, to, the, first, chinese, translation, of, euclid, s, elements, in, 1607, the, discovery, of, a, xi, an, stele, at, xi, an, in, 1625, also, permitted, christianity, to, be, treated, as, an, old, and, established, faith, rather, than, as, a, new, and, dangerous, cult, however, there, were, strong, disagreements, about, the, extent, to, which, converts, could, continue, to, perform, rituals, to, the, emperor, confucius, or, their, ancestors, ricci, had, been, very, accommodating, and, an, attempt, by, his, successors, to, backtrack, from, this, policy, led, to, the, nanjing, incident, of, 1616, which, exiled, four, jesuits, to, macau, and, forced, the, others, out, of, public, life, for, six, years, a, series, of, spectacular, failures, by, the, chinese, astronomers, including, missing, an, eclipse, easily, computed, by, xu, guangqi, and, sabatino, de, ursis, and, a, return, by, the, jesuits, to, presenting, themselves, as, educated, scholars, in, the, confucian, mold, restored, their, fortunes, however, by, the, end, of, the, ming, the, dominicans, had, begun, the, chinese, rites, controversy, in, rome, that, would, eventually, lead, to, a, full, ban, of, christianity, under, the, qing, dynasty, during, his, mission, ricci, was, also, contacted, in, beijing, by, one, of, the, approximately, 5, 000, kaifeng, jews, and, introduced, them, and, their, long, history, in, china, to, europe, however, the, 1642, flood, caused, by, kaifeng, s, ming, governor, devastated, the, community, which, lost, five, of, its, twelve, families, its, synagogue, and, most, of, its, torah, during, the, ming, dynasty, the, neo, confucian, doctrines, of, the, song, scholar, zhu, xi, were, embraced, by, the, court, and, the, chinese, literati, at, large, although, the, direct, line, of, his, school, was, destroyed, by, the, yongle, emperor, s, extermination, of, the, ten, degrees, of, kinship, of, fang, xiaoru, in, 1402, the, ming, scholar, most, influential, upon, subsequent, generations, however, was, wang, yangming, 1472, 1529, whose, teachings, were, attacked, in, his, own, time, for, their, similarity, to, chan, buddhism, building, upon, zhu, xi, s, concept, of, the, extension, of, knowledge, or, gaining, understanding, through, careful, and, rational, investigation, of, things, and, events, wang, argued, that, universal, concepts, would, appear, in, the, minds, of, anyone, therefore, he, claimed, that, anyone, no, matter, their, pedigree, or, education, could, become, as, wise, as, confucius, and, mencius, had, been, and, that, their, writings, were, not, sources, of, truth, but, merely, guides, that, might, have, flaws, when, carefully, examined, a, peasant, with, a, great, deal, of, experience, and, intelligence, would, then, be, wiser, than, an, official, who, had, memorized, the, classics, but, not, experienced, the, real, world, other, scholar, bureaucrats, were, wary, of, wang, s, heterodoxy, the, increasing, number, of, his, disciples, while, he, was, still, in, office, and, his, overall, socially, rebellious, message, to, curb, his, influence, he, was, often, sent, out, to, deal, with, military, affairs, and, rebellions, far, away, from, the, capital, yet, his, ideas, penetrated, mainstream, chinese, thought, and, spurred, new, interest, in, taoism, and, buddhism, furthermore, people, began, to, question, the, validity, of, the, social, hierarchy, and, the, idea, that, the, scholar, should, be, above, the, farmer, wang, yangming, s, disciple, and, salt, mine, worker, wang, gen, gave, lectures, to, commoners, about, pursuing, education, to, improve, their, lives, while, his, follower, he, xinyin, challenged, the, elevation, and, emphasis, of, the, family, in, chinese, society, his, contemporary, li, zhi, even, taught, that, women, were, the, intellectual, equals, of, men, and, should, be, given, a, better, education, both, li, and, he, eventually, died, in, prison, jailed, on, charges, of, spreading, dangerous, ideas, yet, these, dangerous, ideas, of, educating, women, had, long, been, embraced, by, some, mothers, and, by, courtesans, who, were, as, literate, and, skillful, in, calligraphy, painting, and, poetry, as, their, male, guests, the, liberal, views, of, wang, yangming, were, opposed, by, the, censorate, and, by, the, donglin, academy, re, established, in, 1604, these, conservatives, wanted, a, revival, of, orthodox, confucian, ethics, conservatives, such, as, gu, xiancheng, 1550, 1612, argued, against, wang, s, idea, of, innate, moral, knowledge, stating, that, this, was, simply, a, legitimization, for, unscrupulous, behavior, such, as, greedy, pursuits, and, personal, gain, these, two, strands, of, confucian, thought, hardened, by, chinese, scholars, notions, of, obligation, towards, their, mentors, developed, into, pervasive, factionalism, among, the, ministers, of, state, who, used, any, opportunity, to, impeach, members, of, the, other, faction, from, court, wang, gen, was, able, to, give, philosophical, lectures, to, many, commoners, from, different, regions, because, following, the, trend, already, apparent, in, the, song, dynasty, communities, in, ming, society, were, becoming, less, isolated, as, the, distance, between, market, towns, was, shrinking, schools, descent, groups, religious, associations, and, other, local, voluntary, organizations, were, increasing, in, number, and, allowing, more, contact, between, educated, men, and, local, villagers, jonathan, spence, writes, that, the, distinction, between, what, was, town, and, country, was, blurred, in, ming, china, since, suburban, areas, with, farms, were, located, just, outside, and, in, some, cases, within, the, walls, of, a, city, not, only, was, the, blurring, of, town, and, country, evident, but, also, of, socioeconomic, class, in, the, traditional, four, occupations, sh, n, ng, g, ng, sh, ng, since, artisans, sometimes, worked, on, farms, in, peak, periods, and, farmers, often, traveled, into, the, city, to, find, work, during, times, of, dearth, a, variety, of, occupations, could, be, chosen, or, inherited, from, a, father, s, line, of, work, this, would, include, but, was, not, limited, to, coffin, makers, ironworkers, and, blacksmiths, tailors, cooks, and, noodle, makers, retail, merchants, tavern, teahouse, or, winehouse, managers, shoemakers, seal, cutters, pawnshop, owners, brothel, heads, and, merchant, bankers, engaging, in, a, proto, banking, system, involving, notes, of, exchange, virtually, every, town, had, a, brothel, where, female, and, male, prostitutes, could, be, had, male, catamites, fetched, a, higher, price, than, female, concubines, since, pederasty, with, a, teenage, boy, was, seen, as, a, mark, of, elite, status, regardless, of, sodomy, being, repugnant, to, sexual, norms, public, bathing, became, much, more, common, than, in, earlier, periods, urban, shops, and, retailers, sold, a, variety, of, goods, such, as, special, paper, money, to, burn, at, ancestral, sacrifices, specialized, luxury, goods, headgear, fine, cloth, teas, and, others, smaller, communities, and, townships, too, poor, or, scattered, to, support, shops, and, artisans, obtained, their, goods, from, periodic, market, fairs, and, traveling, peddlers, a, small, township, also, provided, a, place, for, simple, schooling, news, and, gossip, matchmaking, religious, festivals, traveling, theater, groups, tax, collection, and, bases, of, famine, relief, distribution, farming, villagers, in, the, north, spent, their, days, harvesting, crops, like, wheat, and, millet, while, farmers, south, of, the, huai, river, engaged, in, intensive, rice, cultivation, and, had, lakes, and, ponds, where, ducks, and, fish, could, be, raised, the, cultivation, of, mulberry, trees, for, silkworms, and, tea, bushes, could, be, found, mostly, south, of, the, yangzi, river, even, further, south, sugarcane, and, citrus, were, grown, as, basic, crops, some, people, in, the, mountainous, southwest, made, a, living, by, selling, lumber, from, hard, bamboo, besides, cutting, down, trees, to, sell, wood, the, poor, also, made, a, living, by, turning, wood, into, charcoal, and, by, burning, oyster, shells, to, make, lime, and, fired, pots, and, weaving, mats, and, baskets, in, the, north, traveling, by, horse, and, carriage, was, most, common, while, in, the, south, the, myriad, of, rivers, canals, and, lakes, provided, cheap, and, easy, water, transport, although, the, south, had, the, characteristic, of, the, wealthy, landlord, and, tenant, farmers, there, were, on, average, many, more, owner, cultivators, north, of, the, huai, river, due, to, harsher, climate, living, not, far, above, subsistence, level, early, ming, dynasty, saw, the, strictest, sumptuary, laws, in, chinese, history, it, was, illegal, for, commoners, to, wear, fine, silk, or, dress, in, bright, red, dark, green, or, yellow, colors, nor, could, they, wear, boots, or, guan, hats, women, could, not, use, ornaments, made, from, gold, jade, pearl, or, emerald, merchants, and, their, families, were, further, banned, from, using, silk, however, these, laws, were, no, longer, enforced, from, the, middle, ming, period, onwards, after, the, flourishing, of, science, and, technology, in, the, song, dynasty, the, ming, dynasty, perhaps, saw, fewer, advancements, in, science, and, technology, compared, to, the, pace, of, discovery, in, the, western, world, in, fact, key, advances, in, chinese, science, in, the, late, ming, were, spurred, by, contact, with, europe, in, 1626, johann, adam, schall, von, bell, wrote, the, first, chinese, treatise, on, the, telescope, the, yuanjingshuo, far, seeing, optic, glass, in, 1634, the, chongzhen, emperor, acquired, the, telescope, of, the, late, johann, schreck, 1576, 1630, the, heliocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, was, rejected, by, the, catholic, missionaries, in, china, but, johannes, kepler, and, galileo, galilei, s, ideas, slowly, trickled, into, china, starting, with, the, polish, jesuit, michael, boym, 1612, 1659, in, 1627, adam, schall, von, bell, s, treatise, in, 1640, and, finally, joseph, edkins, alex, wylie, and, john, fryer, in, the, 19th, century, catholic, jesuits, in, china, would, promote, copernican, theory, at, court, yet, at, the, same, time, embrace, the, ptolemaic, system, in, their, writing, it, was, not, until, 1865, that, catholic, missionaries, in, china, sponsored, the, heliocentric, model, as, their, protestant, peers, did, although, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, and, guo, shoujing, 1231, 1316, had, laid, the, basis, for, trigonometry, in, china, another, important, work, in, chinese, trigonometry, would, not, be, published, again, until, 1607, with, the, efforts, of, xu, guangqi, and, matteo, ricci, ironically, some, inventions, which, had, their, origins, in, ancient, china, were, reintroduced, to, china, from, europe, during, the, late, ming, for, example, the, field, mill, by, the, 16th, century, the, chinese, calendar, was, in, need, of, reform, although, the, ming, had, adopted, guo, shoujing, s, shoushi, calendar, of, 1281, which, was, just, as, accurate, as, the, gregorian, calendar, the, ming, directorate, of, astronomy, failed, to, periodically, readjust, it, this, was, perhaps, due, to, their, lack, of, expertise, since, their, offices, had, become, hereditary, in, the, ming, and, the, statutes, of, the, ming, prohibited, private, involvement, in, astronomy, a, sixth, generation, descendant, of, the, hongxi, emperor, the, prince, zhu, zaiyu, 1536, 1611, submitted, a, proposal, to, fix, the, calendar, in, 1595, but, the, ultra, conservative, astronomical, commission, rejected, it, this, was, the, same, zhu, zaiyu, who, discovered, the, system, of, tuning, known, as, equal, temperament, a, discovery, made, simultaneously, by, simon, stevin, 1548, 1620, in, europe, in, addition, to, publishing, his, works, on, music, he, was, able, to, publish, his, findings, on, the, calendar, in, 1597, a, year, earlier, the, memorial, of, xing, yunlu, suggesting, a, calendar, improvement, was, rejected, by, the, supervisor, of, the, astronomical, bureau, due, to, the, law, banning, private, practice, of, astronomy, xing, would, later, serve, with, xu, guangqi, in, reforming, the, calendar, chinese, in, 1629, according, to, western, standards, when, the, ming, founder, hongwu, came, upon, the, mechanical, devices, housed, in, the, yuan, dynasty, s, palace, at, khanbaliq, such, as, fountains, with, balls, dancing, on, their, jets, self, operating, tiger, automata, dragon, headed, devices, that, spouted, mists, of, perfume, and, mechanical, clocks, in, the, tradition, of, yi, xing, 683, 727, and, su, song, 1020, 1101, he, associated, all, of, them, with, the, decadence, of, mongol, rule, and, had, them, destroyed, this, was, described, in, full, length, by, the, divisional, director, of, the, ministry, of, works, xiao, xun, who, also, carefully, preserved, details, on, the, architecture, and, layout, of, the, yuan, dynasty, palace, later, european, jesuits, such, as, matteo, ricci, and, nicolas, trigault, would, briefly, mention, indigenous, chinese, clockworks, that, featured, drive, wheels, however, both, ricci, and, trigault, were, quick, to, point, out, that, 16th, century, european, clockworks, were, far, more, advanced, than, the, common, time, keeping, devices, in, china, which, they, listed, as, water, clocks, incense, clocks, and, other, instruments, with, wheels, rotated, by, sand, as, if, by, water, chinese, chinese, records, namely, the, yuan, shi, describe, the, five, wheeled, sand, clock, a, mechanism, pioneered, by, zhan, xiyuan, fl, 1360, 80, which, featured, the, scoop, wheel, of, su, song, s, earlier, astronomical, clock, and, a, stationary, dial, face, over, which, a, pointer, circulated, similar, to, european, models, of, the, time, this, sand, driven, wheel, clock, was, improved, upon, by, zhou, shuxue, fl, 1530, 58, who, added, a, fourth, large, gear, wheel, changed, gear, ratios, and, widened, the, orifice, for, collecting, sand, grains, since, he, criticized, the, earlier, model, for, clogging, up, too, often, the, chinese, were, intrigued, with, european, technology, but, so, were, visiting, europeans, of, chinese, technology, in, 1584, abraham, ortelius, 1527, 1598, featured, in, his, atlas, theatrum, orbis, terrarum, the, peculiar, chinese, innovation, of, mounting, masts, and, sails, onto, carriages, just, like, chinese, ships, gonzales, de, mendoza, also, mentioned, this, a, year, later, noting, even, the, designs, of, them, on, chinese, silken, robes, while, gerardus, mercator, 1512, 1594, featured, them, in, his, atlas, john, milton, 1608, 1674, in, one, of, his, famous, poems, and, andreas, everardus, van, braam, houckgeest, 1739, 1801, in, the, writings, of, his, travel, diary, in, china, the, encyclopedist, song, yingxing, 1587, 1666, documented, a, wide, array, of, technologies, metallurgic, and, industrial, processes, in, his, tiangong, kaiwu, encyclopedia, of, 1637, this, includes, mechanical, and, hydraulic, powered, devices, for, agriculture, and, irrigation, nautical,

an, interest, in, irrigation, fertilizers, famine, relief, economic, and, textile, crops, and, empirical, observation, of, the, elements, that, gave, insight, into, early, understandings, of, chemistry, there, were, many, advances, and, new, designs, in, gunpowder, weapons, during, the, beginning, of, the, dynasty, but, by, the, mid, to, late, ming, the, chinese, began, to, frequently, employ, european, style, artillery, and, firearms, the, huolongjing, compiled, by, jiao, yu, and, liu, bowen, sometime, before, the, latter, s, death, on, 16, may, 1375, with, a, preface, added, by, jiao, in, 1412, featured, many, types, of, cutting, edge, gunpowder, weaponry, for, the, time, this, includes, hollow, gunpowder, filled, exploding, cannonballs, land, mines, that, used, a, complex, trigger, mechanism, of, falling, weights, pins, and, a, steel, wheellock, to, ignite, the, train, of, fuses, naval, mines, fin, mounted, winged, rockets, for, aerodynamic, control, multistage, rockets, propelled, by, booster, rockets, before, igniting, a, swarm, of, smaller, rockets, issuing, forth, from, the, end, of, the, missile, shaped, like, a, dragon, s, head, and, hand, cannons, that, had, up, to, ten, barrels, li, shizhen, 1518, 1593, one, of, the, most, renowned, pharmacologists, and, physicians, in, chinese, history, belonged, to, the, late, ming, period, his, bencao, gangmu, is, a, medical, text, with, 1, 892, entries, each, entry, with, its, own, name, called, a, gang, the, mu, in, the, title, refers, to, the, synonyms, of, each, name, inoculation, although, it, can, be, traced, to, earlier, chinese, folk, medicine, was, detailed, in, chinese, texts, by, the, sixteenth, century, throughout, the, ming, dynasty, around, fifty, texts, were, published, on, the, treatment, of, smallpox, in, regards, to, oral, hygiene, the, ancient, egyptians, had, a, primitive, toothbrush, of, a, twig, frayed, at, the, end, but, the, chinese, were, the, first, to, invent, the, modern, bristle, toothbrush, in, 1498, although, it, used, stiff, pig, hair, sinologist, historians, debate, the, population, figures, for, each, era, in, the, ming, dynasty, the, historian, timothy, brook, notes, that, the, ming, government, census, figures, are, dubious, since, fiscal, obligations, prompted, many, families, to, underreport, the, number, of, people, in, their, households, and, many, county, officials, to, underreport, the, number, of, households, in, their, jurisdiction, children, were, often, underreported, especially, female, children, as, shown, by, skewed, population, statistics, throughout, the, ming, even, adult, women, were, underreported, for, example, the, daming, prefecture, in, north, zhili, reported, a, population, of, 378, 167, males, and, 226, 982, females, in, 1502, the, government, attempted, to, revise, the, census, figures, using, estimates, of, the, expected, average, number, of, people, in, each, household, but, this, did, not, solve, the, widespread, problem, of, tax, registration, some, part, of, the, gender, imbalance, may, be, attributed, to, the, practice, of, female, infanticide, the, practice, is, well, documented, in, china, going, back, over, two, thousand, years, and, it, was, described, as, rampant, and, practiced, by, almost, every, family, by, contemporary, authors, however, the, dramatically, skewed, sex, ratios, which, many, counties, reported, exceeding, 2, 1, by, 1586, cannot, likely, be, explained, by, infanticide, alone, the, number, of, people, counted, in, the, census, of, 1381, was, 59, 873, 305, however, this, number, dropped, significantly, when, the, government, found, that, some, 3, million, people, were, missing, from, the, tax, census, of, 1391, even, though, underreporting, figures, was, made, a, capital, crime, in, 1381, the, need, for, survival, pushed, many, to, abandon, the, tax, registration, and, wander, from, their, region, where, hongwu, had, attempted, to, impose, rigid, immobility, on, the, populace, the, government, tried, to, mitigate, this, by, creating, their, own, conservative, estimate, of, 60, 545, 812, people, in, 1393, in, his, studies, on, the, population, of, china, ho, ping, ti, suggests, revising, the, 1393, census, to, 65, million, people, noting, that, large, areas, of, north, china, and, frontier, areas, were, not, counted, in, that, census, brook, states, that, the, population, figures, gathered, in, the, official, censuses, after, 1393, ranged, between, 51, and, 62, million, while, the, population, was, in, fact, increasing, even, the, hongzhi, emperor, r, 1487, 1505, remarked, that, the, daily, increase, in, subjects, coincided, with, the, daily, dwindling, number, of, registered, civilians, and, soldiers, william, atwell, states, that, around, 1400, the, population, of, china, was, perhaps, 90, million, people, citing, heijdra, and, mote, historians, are, now, turning, to, local, gazetteers, of, ming, china, for, clues, that, would, show, consistent, growth, in, population, using, the, gazetteers, brook, estimates, that, the, overall, population, under, the, chenghua, emperor, r, 1464, 87, was, roughly, 75, million, despite, mid, ming, census, figures, hovering, around, 62, million, while, prefectures, across, the, empire, in, the, mid, ming, period, were, reporting, either, a, drop, in, or, stagnant, population, size, local, gazetteers, reported, massive, amounts, of, incoming, vagrant, workers, with, not, enough, good, cultivated, land, for, them, to, till, so, that, many, would, become, drifters, conmen, or, wood, cutters, that, contributed, to, deforestation, the, hongzhi, and, zhengde, emperors, lessened, the, penalties, against, those, who, had, fled, their, home, region, while, the, jiajing, emperor, r, 1521, 67, finally, had, officials, register, migrants, wherever, they, had, moved, or, fled, in, order, to, bring, in, more, revenues, even, with, the, jiajing, reforms, to, document, migrant, workers, and, merchants, by, the, late, ming, era, the, government, census, still, did, not, accurately, reflect, the, enormous, growth, in, population, gazetteers, across, the, empire, noted, this, and, made, their, own, estimations, of, the, overall, population, in, the, ming, some, guessing, that, it, had, doubled, tripled, or, even, grown, fivefold, since, 1368, fairbank, estimates, that, the, population, was, perhaps, 160, million, in, the, late, ming, dynasty, while, brook, estimates, 175, million, and, ebrey, states, perhaps, as, large, as, 200, million, however, a, great, epidemic, that, started, in, shanxi, province, in, 1633, ravaged, the, densely, populated, areas, along, the, grand, canal, a, gazetteer, in, northern, zhejiang, noted, more, than, half, the, population, fell, ill, that, year, and, that, 90, of, the, local, populace, in, one, area, was, dead, by, 1642
