an, archaeological, culture, is, a, recurring, assemblage, of, types, of, artifacts, buildings, and, monuments, from, a, specific, period, and, region, that, may, constitute, the, material, culture, remains, of, a, particular, past, human, society, the, connection, between, these, types, is, an, empirical, observation, their, interpretation, in, terms, of, ethnic, or, political, groups, is, based, on, archaeologists, understanding, however, this, is, often, subject, to, long, unresolved, debates, the, concept, of, the, archaeological, culture, is, fundamental, to, culture, historical, archaeology, different, cultural, groups, have, material, culture, items, that, differ, both, functionally, and, aesthetically, due, to, varying, cultural, and, social, practices, this, notion, is, observably, true, on, the, broadest, scales, for, example, the, equipment, associated, with, the, brewing, of, tea, varies, greatly, across, the, world, social, relations, to, material, culture, often, include, notions, of, identity, and, status, advocates, of, culture, historical, archaeology, use, the, notion, to, argue, that, sets, of, material, culture, can, be, used, to, trace, ancient, groups, of, people, that, were, either, self, identifying, societies, or, ethnic, groups, archaeological, culture, is, a, classifying, device, to, order, archaeological, data, focused, on, artifacts, as, an, expression, of, culture, rather, than, people, the, classic, definition, of, this, idea, comes, from, gordon, childe, we, find, certain, types, of, remains, pots, implements, ornaments, burial, rites, and, house, forms, constantly, recurring, together, such, a, complex, of, associated, traits, we, shall, call, a, cultural, group, or, just, a, culture, we, assume, that, such, a, complex, is, the, material, expression, of, what, today, we, would, call, a, people, the, concept, of, an, archaeological, culture, was, crucial, to, linking, the, typological, analysis, of, archaeological, evidence, to, mechanisms, that, attempted, to, explain, why, they, change, through, time, the, key, explanations, favoured, by, culture, historians, were, the, diffusion, of, forms, from, one, group, to, another, or, the, migration, of, the, peoples, themselves, a, simplistic, example, of, the, process, might, be, that, if, one, pottery, type, had, handles, very, similar, to, those, of, a, neighbouring, type, but, decoration, similar, to, a, different, neighbour, the, idea, for, the, two, features, might, have, diffused, from, the, neighbours, conversely, if, one, pottery, type, suddenly, replaces, a, great, diversity, of, pottery, types, in, an, entire, region, that, might, be, interpreted, as, a, new, group, migrating, in, with, this, new, style, this, idea, of, culture, is, known, as, normative, culture, it, relies, on, the, assumption, found, in, the, view, of, archaeological, culture, that, artifacts, found, are, an, expression, of, cultural, norms, and, that, these, norms, define, culture, this, view, is, also, required, to, be, polythetic, multiple, artifacts, must, be, found, for, a, site, to, be, classified, under, a, specific, archaeological, culture, one, trait, alone, does, not, result, in, a, culture, rather, a, combination, of, traits, are, required, this, view, culture, gives, life, to, the, artifacts, themselves, once, cultures, are, regarded, as, things, it, is, possible, to, attribute, behavior, to, them, and, to, talk, about, them, as, if, they, were, living, organisms, archaeological, cultures, were, generally, equated, with, separate, peoples, ethnic, groups, or, races, leading, in, some, cases, to, distinct, nationalist, archaeologies, most, archaeological, cultures, are, named, after, either, the, type, artifact, or, type, site, that, defines, the, culture, for, example, cultures, may, be, named, after, pottery, types, such, as, linear, pottery, culture, or, funnelbeaker, culture, more, frequently, they, are, named, after, the, site, at, which, the, culture, was, first, defined, such, as, the, hallstatt, culture, or, clovis, culture, since, the, term, culture, has, many, different, meanings, scholars, have, also, coined, a, more, specific, term, paleoculture, as, a, specific, designation, for, prehistoric, cultures, critics, argue, that, cultural, taxonomies, lack, a, strong, consensus, on, the, epistemological, aims, of, cultural, taxonomy, the, use, of, the, term, culture, entered, archaeology, through, 19th, century, german, ethnography, where, the, kultur, of, tribal, groups, and, rural, peasants, was, distinguished, from, the, zivilisation, of, urbanised, peoples, in, contrast, to, the, broader, use, of, the, word, that, was, introduced, to, english, language, anthropology, by, edward, burnett, tylor, kultur, was, used, by, german, ethnologists, to, describe, the, distinctive, ways, of, life, of, a, particular, people, or, volk, in, this, sense, equivalent, to, the, french, civilisation, works, of, kulturgeschichte, culture, history, were, produced, by, a, number, of, german, scholars, particularly, gustav, klemm, from, 1780, onwards, reflecting, a, growing, interest, in, ethnicity, in, 19th, century, europe, the, first, use, of, culture, in, an, archaeological, context, was, in, christian, thomsen, s, 1836, work, ledetraad, til, nordisk, oldkyndighed, norwegian, guide, to, northern, antiquity, in, the, later, half, of, the, 19th, century, archaeologists, in, scandinavia, and, central, europe, increasingly, made, use, of, the, german, concept, of, culture, to, describe, the, different, groups, they, distinguished, in, the, archaeological, record, of, particular, sites, and, regions, often, alongside, and, as, a, synonym, of, civilisation, it, was, not, until, the, 20th, century, and, the, works, of, german, prehistorian, and, fervent, nationalist, gustaf, kossinna, that, the, idea, of, archaeological, cultures, became, central, to, the, discipline, kossinna, saw, the, archaeological, record, as, a, mosaic, of, clearly, defined, cultures, or, kultur, gruppen, culture, groups, that, were, strongly, associated, with, race, he, was, particularly, interested, in, reconstructing, the, movements, of, what, he, saw, as, the, direct, prehistoric, ancestors, of, germans, slavs, celts, and, other, major, indo, european, ethnic, groups, in, order, to, trace, the, aryan, race, to, its, homeland, or, urheimat, the, strongly, racist, character, of, kossinna, s, work, meant, it, had, little, direct, influence, outside, of, germany, at, the, time, the, nazi, party, enthusiastically, embraced, his, theories, or, at, all, after, world, war, ii, however, the, more, general, culture, history, approach, to, archaeology, that, he, began, did, replace, social, evolutionism, as, the, dominant, paradigm, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, kossinna, s, basic, concept, of, the, archaeological, culture, stripped, of, its, racial, aspects, was, adopted, by, vere, gordon, childe, and, franz, boas, at, the, time, the, most, influential, archaeologists, in, britain, and, america, respectively, childe, in, particular, was, responsible, for, formulating, the, definition, of, archaeological, culture, that, is, still, largely, applies, today, he, defined, archaeological, culture, as, artifacts, and, remains, that, consistently, occur, together, this, introduced, a, new, and, discrete, usage, of, the, term, which, was, significantly, different, from, current, anthropological, usage, his, definition, in, particular, was, purely, a, classifying, device, to, order, the, archaeological, data, though, he, was, sceptical, about, identifying, particular, ethnicities, in, the, archaeological, record, and, inclined, much, more, to, diffusionism, than, migrationism, to, explain, culture, change, childe, and, later, culture, historical, archaeologists, like, kossinna, still, equated, separate, archaeological, cultures, with, separate, peoples, later, archaeologists, have, questioned, the, straightforward, relationship, between, material, culture, and, human, societies, the, definition, of, archaeological, cultures, and, their, relationship, to, past, people, has, become, less, clear, in, some, cases, what, was, believed, to, be, a, monolithic, culture, is, shown, by, further, study, to, be, discrete, societies, for, example, the, windmill, hill, culture, now, serves, as, a, general, label, for, several, different, groups, that, occupied, southern, great, britain, during, the, neolithic, conversely, some, archaeologists, have, argued, that, some, supposedly, distinctive, cultures, are, manifestations, of, a, wider, culture, but, they, show, local, differences, based, on, environmental, factors, such, as, those, related, to, clactonian, man, conversely, archaeologists, may, make, a, distinction, between, material, cultures, that, actually, belonged, to, a, single, cultural, group, it, has, been, highlighted, for, example, that, village, dwelling, and, nomadic, bedouin, arabs, have, radically, different, material, cultures, even, if, in, other, respects, they, are, very, similar, in, the, past, such, synchronous, findings, were, often, interpreted, as, representing, intrusion, by, other, groups, the, concept, of, archaeological, cultures, is, itself, a, divisive, subject, within, the, archaeological, field, when, first, developed, archaeologic, culture, was, viewed, as, a, reflection, of, actual, human, culture, in, the, traditional, view, we, translate, present, into, past, by, collecting, artifacts, into, groups, and, naming, those, groups, as, archaeological, cultures, we, then, make, the, equation, between, an, archaeological, and, a, human, culture, by, making, the, assumption, that, artifacts, are, the, expressions, of, cultural, ideas, or, norms, this, approach, was, termed, culture, history, by, many, this, view, of, culture, would, be, entirely, satisfactory, if, the, aim, of, archaeology, was, solely, the, definition, and, description, of, these, entities, however, as, the, 1960s, rolled, around, and, archaeology, sought, to, be, more, scientific, archaeologists, wanted, to, do, more, than, just, describe, artifacts, and, the, archaeological, culture, found, accusations, came, that, archaeological, culture, was, idealist, as, it, assumes, that, norms, and, ideas, are, seen, as, being, important, in, the, definition, of, cultural, identity, it, stresses, the, particularity, of, cultures, why, and, how, they, are, different, from, the, adjacent, group, processualists, and, other, subsequently, critics, of, cultural, historical, archaeology, argued, that, archaeological, culture, treated, culture, as, just, a, rag, tag, assemblage, of, ideas, archaeological, culture, is, presently, useful, for, sorting, and, assembling, artifacts, especially, in, european, archaeology, that, often, falls, towards, culture, historical, archaeology
