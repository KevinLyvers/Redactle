the, bronze, age, was, a, historical, period, lasting, from, approximately, 3300, to, 1200, bc, it, was, characterized, by, the, use, of, bronze, the, use, of, writing, in, some, areas, and, other, features, of, early, urban, civilization, the, bronze, age, is, the, middle, principal, period, of, the, three, age, system, between, the, stone, and, iron, ages, worldwide, the, bronze, age, generally, followed, the, neolithic, period, with, the, chalcolithic, serving, as, a, transition, the, bronze, age, is, generally, considered, to, have, ended, with, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, a, time, of, widespread, societal, collapse, between, c, 1200, and, 1150, bc, this, collapse, affected, a, large, area, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, including, north, africa, and, southeast, europe, as, well, as, the, near, east, in, particular, egypt, eastern, libya, the, balkans, the, aegean, anatolia, and, the, caucasus, it, was, sudden, violent, and, culturally, disruptive, for, many, bronze, age, civilizations, and, it, brought, a, sharp, economic, decline, to, regional, powers, most, notably, ushering, in, the, greek, dark, ages, an, ancient, civilization, is, deemed, to, be, part, of, the, bronze, age, if, it, either, produced, bronze, by, smelting, its, own, copper, and, alloying, it, with, tin, arsenic, or, other, metals, or, traded, other, items, for, bronze, from, producing, areas, elsewhere, bronze, age, cultures, were, the, first, to, develop, writing, according, to, archaeological, evidence, cultures, in, mesopotamia, which, used, cuneiform, script, and, egypt, which, used, hieroglyphs, developed, the, earliest, practical, writing, systems, bronze, age, civilizations, gained, a, technological, advantage, due, to, bronze, s, harder, and, more, durable, properties, than, other, metals, available, at, the, time, while, terrestrial, iron, is, naturally, abundant, the, higher, temperature, required, for, smelting, 1, 250, c, 2, 280, f, in, addition, to, the, greater, difficulty, of, working, with, it, placed, it, out, of, reach, of, common, use, until, the, end, of, the, second, millennium, bc, tin, s, lower, melting, point, of, 232, c, 450, f, and, copper, s, moderate, melting, point, of, 1, 085, c, 1, 985, f, placed, both, these, metals, within, the, capabilities, of, neolithic, pottery, kilns, which, date, back, to, 6, 000, bc, and, were, able, to, produce, temperatures, of, at, least, 900, c, 1, 650, f, copper, and, tin, ores, are, rare, since, there, were, no, tin, bronzes, in, west, asia, before, trading, in, bronze, began, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, the, bronze, age, is, characterized, by, the, widespread, use, of, bronze, even, if, only, by, elites, in, the, early, years, though, the, introduction, and, development, of, bronze, technology, were, not, universally, synchronous, tin, bronze, technology, requires, systematic, techniques, tin, must, be, mined, mainly, as, the, tin, ore, cassiterite, and, smelted, separately, then, added, to, hot, copper, to, make, bronze, alloy, the, bronze, age, was, a, time, of, extensive, use, of, metals, and, the, development, of, trade, networks, a, 2013, report, suggests, that, the, earliest, tin, alloy, bronze, was, a, foil, dated, to, the, mid, 5th, millennium, bc, from, a, vin, a, culture, site, in, plo, nik, serbia, although, this, culture, is, not, conventionally, considered, part, of, the, bronze, age, however, the, dating, of, the, foil, has, been, disputed, west, asia, and, the, near, east, were, the, first, regions, to, enter, the, bronze, age, beginning, with, the, rise, of, the, mesopotamian, civilization, of, sumer, in, the, mid, 4th, millennium, bc, cultures, in, the, ancient, near, east, practised, intensive, year, round, agriculture, developed, writing, systems, invented, the, potter, s, wheel, created, centralized, governments, usually, in, the, form, of, hereditary, monarchies, written, law, codes, city, states, and, nation, states, and, empires, embarked, on, advanced, architectural, projects, and, introduced, social, stratification, economic, and, civil, administration, slavery, and, practised, organized, warfare, medicine, and, religion, societies, in, the, region, laid, the, foundations, for, astronomy, mathematics, and, astrology, the, following, dates, are, approximate, for, details, consult, linked, articles, the, bronze, age, in, the, near, east, can, be, conveniently, divided, into, early, middle, and, late, periods, the, dates, and, phases, below, apply, solely, to, the, near, east, not, universally, however, some, archaeologists, propose, a, high, chronology, which, extends, periods, such, as, the, intermediate, bronze, age, by, 300, to, 500, 600, years, based, on, material, analysis, of, southern, levant, in, cities, such, as, hazor, jericho, and, beit, she, an, the, hittite, empire, was, established, during, the, 18th, century, bc, in, hattusa, northern, anatolia, at, its, height, in, the, 14th, century, bc, the, hittite, kingdom, encompassed, central, anatolia, southwestern, syria, as, far, as, ugarit, and, upper, mesopotamia, after, 1180, bc, amid, general, turmoil, in, the, levant, which, is, conjectured, to, have, been, associated, with, the, sudden, arrival, of, the, sea, peoples, the, kingdom, disintegrated, into, several, independent, neo, hittite, city, states, some, of, which, survived, into, the, 8th, century, bc, arzawa, in, western, anatolia, during, the, second, half, of, the, second, millennium, bc, likely, extended, along, southern, anatolia, in, a, belt, from, near, the, turkish, lakes, region, to, the, aegean, coast, arzawa, was, the, western, neighbor, of, the, middle, and, new, hittite, kingdoms, at, times, a, rival, and, at, other, times, a, vassal, the, assuwa, league, was, a, confederation, of, states, in, western, anatolia, defeated, by, the, hittites, under, the, earlier, tudhaliya, i, around, 1400, bc, arzawa, has, been, associated, with, the, much, more, obscure, assuwa, generally, located, to, its, north, it, probably, bordered, it, and, may, even, have, been, an, alternative, term, for, it, at, least, during, some, periods, in, ancient, egypt, the, bronze, age, began, in, the, protodynastic, period, c, 3150, bc, the, archaic, early, bronze, age, of, egypt, known, as, the, early, dynastic, period, of, egypt, immediately, followed, the, unification, of, lower, and, upper, egypt, c, 3100, bc, it, is, generally, taken, to, include, the, first, and, second, dynasties, lasting, from, the, protodynastic, period, until, about, 2686, bc, or, the, beginning, of, the, old, kingdom, with, the, first, dynasty, the, capital, moved, from, abydos, to, memphis, with, a, unified, egypt, ruled, by, an, egyptian,

dynastic, period, memphis, in, the, early, bronze, age, was, the, largest, city, of, the, time, the, old, kingdom, of, the, regional, bronze, age, is, the, name, given, to, the, period, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, when, egyptian, civilization, attained, its, first, continuous, peak, of, complexity, and, achievement, the, first, of, three, kingdom, periods, which, marked, the, high, points, of, civilization, in, the, lower, nile, valley, the, others, being, the, middle, kingdom, and, the, new, kingdom, the, first, intermediate, period, of, egypt, often, described, as, a, dark, period, in, ancient, egyptian, history, spanned, about, 100, years, after, the, end, of, the, old, kingdom, from, about, 2181, to, 2055, bc, very, little, monumental, evidence, survives, from, this, period, especially, from, the, early, part, of, it, the, first, intermediate, period, was, a, dynamic, time, when, the, rule, of, egypt, was, roughly, divided, between, two, areas, heracleopolis, in, lower, egypt, and, thebes, in, upper, egypt, these, two, kingdoms, eventually, came, into, conflict, and, the, theban, kings, conquered, the, north, reunifying, egypt, under, a, single, ruler, during, the, second, part, of, the, eleventh, dynasty, the, bronze, age, in, nubia, started, as, early, as, 2300, bc, egyptians, introduced, copper, smelting, to, the, nubian, city, of, mero, in, modern, day, sudan, around, 2600, bc, a, furnace, for, bronze, casting, found, in, kerma, dated, back, to, 2300, 1900, bc, the, middle, kingdom, of, egypt, lasted, from, 2055, to, 1650, bc, during, this, period, the, osiris, funerary, cult, rose, to, dominate, egyptian, popular, religion, the, period, comprises, two, phases, the, 11th, dynasty, which, ruled, from, thebes, and, the, 12th, and, 13th, dynasties, centred, on, el, lisht, the, unified, kingdom, was, previously, considered, to, comprise, the, 11th, and, 12th, dynasties, but, historians, now, consider, at, least, part, of, the, 13th, dynasty, to, have, belonged, to, the, middle, kingdom, during, the, second, intermediate, period, ancient, egypt, fell, into, disarray, a, second, time, between, the, end, of, the, middle, kingdom, and, the, start, of, the, new, kingdom, best, known, for, the, hyksos, whose, reign, comprised, the, 15th, and, 16th, dynasties, the, hyksos, first, appeared, in, egypt, during, the, 11th, dynasty, began, their, climb, to, power, in, the, 13th, dynasty, and, emerged, from, the, second, intermediate, period, in, control, of, avaris, and, the, delta, by, the, 15th, dynasty, they, ruled, lower, egypt, and, they, were, expelled, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, dynasty, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, also, referred, to, as, the, egyptian, empire, lasted, from, the, 16th, to, the, 11th, century, bc, the,

population, the, aramaeans, never, had, a, unified, empire, they, were, divided, into, independent, kingdoms, all, across, the, near, east, after, the, bronze, age, collapse, their, political, influence, was, confined, to, syro, hittite, states, which, were, entirely, absorbed, into, the, neo, assyrian, empire, by, the, 8th, century, bc, the, mesopotamian, bronze, age, began, about, 3500,

people, ur, kish, isin, larsa, and, nippur, in, the, middle, bronze, age, and, babylon, calah, and, assur, in, the, late, bronze, age, similarly, had, large, populations, the, akkadian, empire, 2335, 2154, bc, became, the, dominant, power, in, the, region, after, its, fall, the, sumerians, enjoyed, a, renaissance, with, the, neo, sumerian, empire, assyria, along, with, the, old, assyrian, empire, c, 1800, 1600, bc, became, a, regional, power, under, the, amorite, king, shamshi, adad, i, the, earliest, mention, of, babylon, then, a, small, administrative, town, appears, on, a, tablet, from, the, reign, of, sargon, of, akkad, in, the, 23rd, century, bc, the, amorite, dynasty, established, the, city, state, of, babylon, in, the, 19th, century, bc, over, 100, years, later, it, briefly, took, over, the, other, city, states, and, formed, the, short, lived, first, babylonian, empire, during, what, is, also, called, the, old, babylonian, period, akkad, assyria, and, babylonia, all, used, the, written, east, semitic, akkadian, language, for, official, use, and, as, a, spoken, language, by, that, time, the, sumerian, language, was, no, longer, spoken, but, was, still, in, religious, use, in, assyria, and, babylonia, and, would, remain, so, until, the, 1st, century, ad, the, akkadian, and, sumerian, traditions, played, a, major, role, in, later, assyrian, and, babylonian, culture, despite, this, babylonia, unlike, the, more, militarily, powerful, assyria, was, founded, by, non, native, amorites, and, often, ruled, by, other, non, indigenous, peoples, such, as, the, kassites, aramaeans, and, chaldeans, as, well, as, by, its, assyrian, neighbours, for, many, decades, scholars, made, superficial, reference, to, central, asia, as, the, pastoral, realm, or, alternatively, the, nomadic, world, in, what, researchers, have, come, to, call, the, central, asian, void, a, 5, 000, year, span, that, was, neglected, in, studies, of, the, origins, of, agriculture, foothill, regions, and, glacial, melt, streams, supported, bronze, age, agropastoralists, who, developed, complex, east, west, trade, routes, between, central, asia, and, china, that, introduced, wheat, and, barley, to, china, and, millet, to, central, asia, the, bactria, margiana, archaeological, complex, bmac, also, known, as, the, oxus, civilization, was, a, bronze, age, civilization, in, central, asia, dated, to, c, 2400, 1600, bc, located, in, present, day, northern, afghanistan, eastern, turkmenistan, southern, uzbekistan, and, western, tajikistan, centred, on, the, upper, amu, darya, oxus, river, its, sites, were, discovered, and, named, by, the, soviet, archaeologist, viktor, sarianidi, 1976, bactria, was, the, greek, name, for, the, area, of, bactra, modern, balkh, in, what, is, now, northern, afghanistan, and, margiana, was, the, greek, name, for, the, persian, satrapy, of, margu, the, capital, of, which, was, merv, in, modern, day, southeastern, turkmenistan, a, wealth, of, information, indicates, that, the, bmac, had, close, international, relations, with, the, indus, valley, the, iranian, plateau, and, possibly, even, indirectly, with, mesopotamia, all, civilizations, were, very, familiar, with, lost, wax, casting, according, to, a, 2019, study, the, bmac, was, not, a, primary, contributor, to, later, south, asian, genetics, the, altai, mountains, in, what, is, now, southern, russia, and, central, mongolia, have, been, identified, as, the, point, of, origin, of, a, cultural, enigma, termed, the, seima, turbino, phenomenon, it, is, conjectured, that, changes, in, climate, in, this, region, around, 2000, bc, and, the, ensuing, ecological, economic, and, political, changes, triggered, a, rapid, and, massive, migration, westward, into, northeast, europe, eastward, into, china, and, southward, into, vietnam, and, thailand, across, a, frontier, of, some, 4, 000, mi, 6, 000, km, this, migration, took, place, in, just, five, to, six, generations, and, led, to, peoples, from, finland, in, the, west, to, thailand, in, the, east, employing, the, same, metalworking, technology, and, in, some, areas, horse, breeding, and, riding, however, recent, genetic, testings, of, sites, in, south, siberia, and, kazakhstan, andronovo, horizon, would, rather, support, spreading, of, the, bronze, technology, via, indo, european, migrations, eastwards, as, this, technology, had, been, well, known, for, quite, a, while, in, western, regions, it, is, further, conjectured, that, the, same, migrations, spread, the, uralic, group, of, languages, across, europe, and, asia, some, 39, languages, of, this, group, still, exist, including, hungarian, finnish, and, estonian, in, china, the, earliest, bronze, artefacts, have, been, found, in, the, majiayao, culture, site, between, 3100, and, 2700, bc, the, term, bronze, age, has, been, transferred, to, the, archaeology, of, china, from, that, of, western, eurasia, and, there, is, no, consensus, or, universally, used, convention, delimiting, the, bronze, age, in, the, context, of, chinese, prehistory, early, bronze, age, in, china, is, sometimes, taken, as, equivalent, to, the, shang, dynasty, period, 16th, to, 11th, centuries, bc, and, the, later, bronze, age, as, equivalent, to, the, zhou, dynasty, period, 11th, to, 3rd, centuries, bc, from, the, 5th, century, also, called, iron, age, although, there, is, an, argument, to, be, made, that, the, bronze, age, proper, never, ended, in, china, as, there, is, no, recognizable, transition, to, an, iron, age, significantly, together, with, the, jade, art, that, precedes, it, bronze, was, seen, as, a, fine, material, for, ritual, art, when, compared, with, iron, or, stone, bronze, metallurgy, in, china, originated, in, what, is, referred, to, as, the, erlitou, wade, giles, erh, li, t, ou, period, which, some, historians, argue, places, it, within, the, shang, dynasty, others, believe, the, erlitou, sites, belong, to, the, preceding, xia, wade, giles, hsia, dynasty, the, u, s, national, gallery, of, art, defines, the, chinese, bronze, age, as, the, period, between, about, 2000, bc, and, 771, bc, a, period, that, begins, with, the, erlitou, culture, and, ends, abruptly, with, the, disintegration, of, western, zhou, rule, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, bronze, work, developed, inside, of, china, apart, from, outside, influence, however, the, discovery, of, europoid, mummies, in, xinjiang, has, caused, some, archaeologists, such, as, johan, gunnar, andersson, jan, romgard, and, an, zhimin, to, suggest, a, possible, route, of, transmission, from, the, west, eastwards, according, to, an, zhimin, it, can, be, imagined, that, initially, bronze, and, iron, technology, took, its, rise, in, west, asia, first, influenced, the, xinjiang, region, and, then, reached, the, yellow, river, valley, providing, external, impetus, for, the, rise, of, the, shang, and, zhou, civilizations, according, to, jan, romgard, bronze, and, iron, tools, seem, to, have, traveled, from, west, to, east, as, well, as, the, use, of, wheeled, wagons, and, the, domestication, of, the, horse, there, are, also, possible, links, to, seima, turbino, culture, a, transcultural, complex, across, northern, eurasia, the, eurasian, steppe, and, the, urals, however, the, oldest, bronze, objects, found, in, china, so, far, were, discovered, at, the, majiayao, site, in, gansu, rather, than, at, xinjiang, the, shang, dynasty, also, known, as, the, yin, dynasty, of, the, yellow, river, valley, rose, to, power, after, the, xia, dynasty, around, 1600, bc, while, some, direct, information, about, the, shang, dynasty, comes, from, shang, era, inscriptions, on, bronze, artefacts, most, comes, from, oracle, bones, turtle, shells, cattle, scapulae, or, other, bones, which, bear, glyphs, that, form, the, first, significant, corpus, of, recorded, chinese, characters, the, production, of, erlitou, in, henan, represents, the, earliest, large, scale, metallurgy, industry, in, the, central, plains, of, china, the, influence, of, the, saima, turbino, metalworking, tradition, from, the, north, is, supported, by, a, series, of, recent, discoveries, in, china, of, many, unique, perforated, spearheads, with, downward, hooks, and, small, loops, on, the, same, or, opposite, side, of, the, socket, which, could, be, associated, with, the, seima, turbino, visual, vocabulary, of, southern, siberia, the, metallurgical, centres, of, northwestern, china, especially, qijia, in, gansu, and, kexingzhuang, culture, in, shaanxi, played, an, intermediary, role, in, this, process, iron, has, been, found, from, the, zhou, dynasty, but, its, use, was, minimal, chinese, literature, dating, to, the, 6th, century, bc, attests, to, knowledge, of, iron, smelting, yet, bronze, continues, to, occupy, the, seat, of, significance, in, the, archaeological, and, historical, record, for, some, time, after, this, historian, w, c, white, argues, that, iron, did, not, supplant, bronze, at, any, period, before, the, end, of, the, zhou, dynasty, 256, bc, and, that, bronze, vessels, make, up, the, majority, of, metal, vessels, through, the, later, han, period, or, to, 221, bc, the, chinese, bronze, artefacts, generally, are, either, utilitarian, like, spear, points, or, adze, heads, or, ritual, bronzes, which, are, more, elaborate, versions, in, precious, materials, of, everyday, vessels, as, well, as, tools, and, weapons, examples, are, the, numerous, large, sacrificial, tripods, known, as, dings, in, chinese, there, are, many, other, distinct, shapes, surviving, identified, chinese, ritual, bronzes, tend, to, be, highly, decorated, often, with, the, taotie, motif, which, involves, highly, stylised, animal, faces, these, appear, in, three, main, motif, types, those, of, demons, symbolic, animals, and, abstract, symbols, many, large, bronzes, also, bear, cast, inscriptions, that, are, the, great, bulk, of, the, surviving, body, of, early, chinese, writing, and, have, helped, historians, and, archaeologists, piece, together, the, history, of, china, especially, during, the, zhou, dynasty, 1046, 256, bc, the, bronzes, of, the, western, zhou, dynasty, document, large, portions, of, history, not, found, in, the, extant, texts, that, were, often, composed, by, persons, of, varying, rank, and, possibly, even, social, class, further, the, medium, of, cast, bronze, lends, the, record, they, preserve, a, permanence, not, enjoyed, by, manuscripts, these, inscriptions, can, commonly, be, subdivided, into, four, parts, a, reference, to, the, date, and, place, the, naming, of, the, event, commemorated, the, list, of, gifts, given, to, the, artisan, in, exchange, for, the, bronze, and, a, dedication, the, relative, points, of, reference, these, vessels, provide, have, enabled, historians, to, place, most, of, the, vessels, within, a, certain, time, frame, of, the, western, zhou, period, allowing, them, to, trace, the, evolution, of, the, vessels, and, the, events, they, record, the, japanese, archipelago, saw, the, introduction, of, bronze, during, the,

the, pottery, assemblage, over, the, entire, length, of, the, period, but, especially, 850, 550, bc, the, mumun, period, is, known, for, the, origins, of, intensive, agriculture, and, complex, societies, in, both, the, korean, peninsula, and, the, japanese, archipelago, the, middle, mumun, pottery, period, culture, of, the, southern, korean, peninsula, gradually, adopted, bronze,

c, 900, 700, bc, the, bronze, daggers, lent, prestige, and, authority, to, the, personages, who, wielded, and, were, buried, with, them, in, high, status, megalithic, burials, at, south, coastal, centres, such, as, the, igeum, dong, site, bronze, was, an, important, element, in, ceremonies, and, for, mortuary, offerings, until, 100, bc, dates, are, approximate, consult, linked, articles, for, details, the, bronze, age, on, the, indian, subcontinent, began, around, 3300, bc, with, the, beginning, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, inhabitants, of, the, indus, valley, the, harappans, developed, new, techniques, in, metallurgy, and, produced, copper, bronze, lead, and, tin, the, late, harappan, culture, which, dates, from, 1900, to, 1400, bc, overlapped, the, transition, from, the, bronze, age, to, the, iron, age, thus, it, is, difficult, to, date, this, transition, accurately, it, has, been, claimed, that, a, 6, 000, year, old, copper, amulet, manufactured, in, mehrgarh, in, the, shape, of, a, wheel, spoke, is, the, earliest, example, of, lost, wax, casting, in, the, world, the, civilization, s, cities, were, noted, for, their, urban, planning, baked, brick, houses, elaborate, drainage, systems, water, supply, systems, clusters, of, large, non, residential, buildings, and, new, techniques, in, handicraft, carnelian, products, seal, carving, and, metallurgy, copper, bronze, lead, and, tin, the, large, cities, of, mohenjo, daro, and, harappa, very, likely, grew, to, contain, between, 30, 000, and, 60, 000, people, and, the, civilization, itself, during, its, florescence, may, have, contained, between, one, and, five, million, people, the, vilabouly, complex, in, laos, is, a, significant, archaeological, site, for, dating, the, origin, of, bronze, metallurgy, in, southeast, asia, in, ban, chiang, thailand, southeast, asia, bronze, artefacts, have, been, discovered, dating, to, 2100, bc, however, according, to, the, radiocarbon, dating, on, the, human, and, pig, bones, in, ban, chiang, some, scholars, propose, that, the, initial, bronze, age, in, ban, chiang, was, in, the, late, 2nd, millennium, in, nyaunggan, burma, bronze, tools, have, been, excavated, along, with, ceramics, and, stone, artefacts, dating, is, still, currently, broad, 3500, 500, bc, ban, non, wat, excavated, by, charles, higham, was, a, rich, site, with, over, 640, graves, excavated, that, gleaned, many, complex, bronze, items, that, may, have, had, social, value, connected, to, them, ban, chiang, however, is, the, most, thoroughly, documented, site, and, has, the, clearest, evidence, of, metallurgy, when, in, southeast, asia, with, a, rough, date, range, from, the, late, 3rd, millennium, bc, to, the, first, millennium, ad, this, site, alone, has, artefacts, such, as, burial, pottery, dating, from, 2100, to, 1700, bc, and, fragments, of, bronze, and, copper, base, bangles, this, technology, suggested, on, site, casting, from, the, very, beginning, the, on, site, casting, supports, the, theory, that, bronze, was, first, introduced, in, southeast, asia, from, a, different, country, some, scholars, believe, that, copper, based, metallurgy, was, disseminated, from, northwest, and, central, china, south, and, southwest, via, areas, such, as, guangdong, province, and, yunnan, province, and, finally, into, southeast, asia, around, 1000, bc, archaeology, also, suggests, that, bronze, age, metallurgy, may, not, have, been, as, significant, a, catalyst, in, social, stratification, and, warfare, in, southeast, asia, as, in, other, regions, and, that, social, distribution, shifted, away, from, chiefdom, states, to, a, heterarchical, network, data, analyses, of, sites, such, as, ban, lum, khao, ban, na, di, non, nok, tha, khok, phanom, di, and, nong, nor, have, consistently, led, researchers, to, conclude, that, there, was, no, entrenched, hierarchy, dating, back, to, the, neolithic, age, the, first, bronze, drums, called, the, dong, son, drums, were, uncovered, in, and, around, the, red, river, delta, regions, of, northern, vietnam, and, southern, china, these, relate, to, the, dong, son, culture, of, vietnam, archaeological, research, in, northern, vietnam, indicates, an, increase, in, rates, of, infectious, disease, following, the, advent, of, metallurgy, skeletal, fragments, in, sites, dating, to, the, early, and, mid, bronze, age, evidence, a, greater, proportion, of, lesions, than, in, sites, of, earlier, periods, there, are, a, few, possible, implications, of, this, one, is, the, increased, contact, with, bacterial, and, or, fungal, pathogens, due, to, increased, population, density, and, land, clearing, cultivation, the, other, one, is, decreased, levels, of, immunocompetence, in, the, metal, age, due, to, changes, in, diet, caused, by, agriculture, the, last, is, that, there, may, have, been, an, emergence, of, infectious, diseases, that, evolved, into, a, more, virulent, form, in, the, metal, period, a, few, examples, of, named, bronze, age, cultures, in, europe, in, roughly, relative, order, dates, are, approximate, consult, linked, articles, for, details, radivojevic, et, al, 2013, reported, the, discovery, of, a, tin, bronze, foil, from, the, plo, nik, archaeological, site, securely, dated, to, c, 4650, bc, as, well, as, 14, other, artefacts, from, serbia, and, bulgaria, dated, to, before, 4000, bc, showing, that, early, tin, bronze, was, more, common, than, previously, thought, and, developed, independently, in, europe, 1500, years, before, the, first, tin, bronze, alloys, in, the, near, east, the, production, of, complex, tin, bronzes, lasted, for, about, 500, years, in, the, balkans, the, authors, reported, that, evidence, for, the, production, of, such, complex, bronzes, disappears, at, the, end, of, the, 5th, millennium, coinciding, with, the, collapse, of, large, cultural, complexes, in, north, eastern, bulgaria, and, thrace, in, the, late, fifth, millennium, bc, tin, bronzes, using, cassiterite, tin, were, reintroduced, to, the, area, some, 1500, years, later, the, oldest, golden, artefacts, in, the, world, 4600, 4200, bc, were, found, in, the, necropolis, of, varna, these, artefacts, are, on, display, in, the, varna, archaeological, museum, the, dabene, treasure, was, unearthed, from, 2004, to, 2007, near, karlovo, plovdiv, province, central, bulgaria, the, whole, treasure, consists, of, 20, 000, gold, jewellery, items, from, 18, to, 23, carats, the, most, important, of, them, was, a, dagger, made, of, gold, and, platinum, with, an, unusual, edge, the, treasure, was, dated, to, the, end, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, scientists, suggest, that, the, karlovo, valley, used, to, be, a, major, crafts, centre, that, exported, golden, jewellery, all, over, europe, it, is, considered, one, of, the, largest, prehistoric, golden, treasures, in, the, world, the, aegean, bronze, age, began, around, 3200, bc, when, civilizations, first, established, a, far, ranging, trade, network, this, network, imported, tin, and, charcoal, to, cyprus, where, copper, was, mined, and, alloyed, with, tin, to, produce, bronze, bronze, objects, were, then, exported, far, and, wide, and, supported, the, trade, isotopic, analysis, of, tin, in, some, mediterranean, bronze, artefacts, suggests, that, they, may, have, originated, from, great, britain, knowledge, of, navigation, was, well, developed, by, this, time, and, reached, a, peak, of, skill, not, exceeded, except, perhaps, by, polynesian, sailors, until, 1730, when, the, invention, of, the, chronometer, enabled, the, precise, determination, of, longitude, the, minoan, civilization, based, in, knossos, on, the, island, of, crete, appears, to, have, coordinated, and, defended, its, bronze, age, trade, ancient, empires, valued, luxury, goods, in, contrast, to, staple, foods, leading, to, famine, bronze, age, collapse, theories, have, described, aspects, of, the, end, of, the, bronze, age, in, this, region, at, the, end, of, the, bronze, age, in, the, aegean, region, the, mycenaean, administration, of, the, regional, trade, empire, followed, the, decline, of, minoan, primacy, several, minoan, client, states, lost, much, of, their, population, to, famine, and, pestilence, this, would, indicate, that, the, trade, network, may, have, failed, preventing, the, trade, that, would, previously, have, relieved, such, famines, and, prevented, illness, caused, by, malnutrition, it, is, also, known, that, in, this, era, the, breadbasket, of, the, minoan, empire, the, area, north, of, the, black, sea, also, suddenly, lost, much, of, its, population, and, thus, probably, some, capacity, to, cultivate, crops, drought, and, famine, in, anatolia, may, have, also, led, to, the, aegean, collapse, by, disrupting, trade, networks, therefore, preventing, the, aegean, from, accessing, bronze, and, luxury, goods, the, aegean, collapse, has, been, attributed, to, the, exhaustion, of, the, cypriot, forests, causing, the, end, of, the, bronze, trade, these, forests, are, known, to, have, existed, in, later, times, and, experiments, have, shown, that, charcoal, production, on, the, scale, necessary, for, the, bronze, production, of, the, late, bronze, age, would, have, exhausted, them, in, less, than, fifty, years, the, aegean, collapse, has, also, been, attributed, to, the, fact, that, as, iron, tools, became, more, common, the, main, justification, for, the, tin, trade, ended, and, that, trade, network, ceased, to, function, as, it, did, formerly, the, colonies, of, the, minoan, empire, then, suffered, drought, famine, war, or, some, combination, of, the, three, and, had, no, access, to, the, distant, resources, of, an, empire, by, which, they, could, easily, recover, the, thera, eruption, occurred, c, 1600, bc, 110, km, 68, mi, north, of, crete, speculation, includes, that, a, tsunami, from, thera, more, commonly, known, today, as, santorini, destroyed, cretan, cities, a, tsunami, may, have, destroyed, the, cretan, navy, in, its, home, harbour, which, then, lost, crucial, naval, battles, so, that, in, the, lmib, lmii, event, c, 1450, bc, the, cities, of, crete, burned, and, the, mycenaean, civilization, took, knossos, over, if, the, eruption, occurred, in, the, late, 17th, century, bc, as, most, chronologists, now, believe, then, its, immediate, effects, belong, to, the, middle, to, late, bronze, age, transition, and, not, to, the, end, of, the, late, bronze, age, but, it, could, have, triggered, the, instability, that, led, to, the, collapse, first, of, knossos, and, then, of, bronze, age, society, overall, one, such, theory, highlights, the, role, of, cretan, expertise, in, administering, the, empire, post, thera, if, this, expertise, was, concentrated, in, crete, then, the, mycenaeans, may, have, made, political, and, commercial, mistakes, in, administering, the, cretan, empire, archaeological, findings, including, some, on, the, island, of, thera, suggest, that, the, centre, of, the, minoan, civilization, at, the, time, of, the, eruption, was, actually, on, thera, rather, than, on, crete, according, to, this, theory, the, catastrophic, loss, of, the, political, administrative, and, economic, centre, due, to, the, eruption, as, well, as, the, damage, wrought, by, the, tsunami, to, the, coastal, towns, and, villages, of, crete, precipitated, the, decline, of, the, minoans, a, weakened, political, entity, with, a, reduced, economic, and, military, capability, and, fabled, riches, would, have, then, been, more, vulnerable, to, conquest, indeed, the, santorini, eruption, is, usually, dated, to, c, 1630, bc, while, the, mycenaean, greeks, first, enter, the, historical, record, a, few, decades, later, c, 1600, bc, the, later, mycenaean, assaults, on, crete, c, 1450, bc, and, troy, c, 1250, bc, would, have, been, a, continuation, of, the, steady, encroachment, of, the, greeks, upon, the, weakened, minoan, world, in, central, europe, the, early, bronze, age, unetice, culture, 2300, 1600, bc, includes, numerous, smaller, groups, like, the, straubing, adlerberg, and, hatvan,

copper, was, alloyed, with, tin, and, used, to, manufacture, ballybeg, type, flat, axes, and, associated, metalwork, the, preceding, period, is, known, as, the, copper, age, and, is, characterised, by, the, production, of, flat, axes, daggers, halberds, and, awls, in, copper, the, period, is, divided, into, three, phases, early, bronze, age, 2000, 1500, bc, middle, bronze, age, 1500, 1200, bc, and, late, bronze, age, 1200, c, 500, bc, ireland, is, known, for, a, relatively, large, number, of, early, bronze, age, burials, the, country, s, stone, circles, and, stone, rows, were, built, during, this, period, one, of, the, characteristic, types, of, artefacts, of, the, early, bronze, age, in, ireland, is, the, flat, axe, there, are, five, main, types, of, flat, axes, lough, ravel, crannog, c, 2200, bc, ballybeg, c, 2000, bc, killaha, c, 2000, bc, ballyvalley, c, 2000, 1600, bc, derryniggin, c, 1600, bc, and, a, number, of, metal, ingots, in, the, shape, of, axes, the, bronze, age, in, northern, europe, spans, the, entire, 2nd, millennium, bc, unetice, culture, urnfield, culture, tumulus, culture, terramare, culture, and, lusatian, culture, lasting, until, c, 600, bc, the, northern, bronze, age, was, both, a, period, and, a, bronze, age, culture, in, scandinavian, pre, history, c, 1700, 500, bc, with, sites, as, far, east, as, estonia, succeeding, the, late, neolithic, culture, its, ethnic, and, linguistic, affinities, are, unknown, in, the, absence, of, written, sources, it, was, followed, by, the, pre, roman, iron, age, even, though, northern, european, bronze, age, cultures, came, relatively, late, and, came, into, existence, via, trade, sites, present, rich, and, well, preserved, objects, made, of, wool, wood, and, imported, central, european, bronze, and, gold, many, rock, carvings, depict, ships, and, the, large, stone, burial, monuments, known, as, stone, ships, suggest, that, shipping, played, an, important, role, thousands, of, rock, carvings, depict, ships, most, probably, representing, sewn, plank, built, canoes, for, warfare, fishing, and, trade, these, may, have, a, history, as, far, back, as, the, neolithic, period, and, continue, into, the, pre, roman, iron, age, as, shown, by, the, hjortspring, boat, there, are, many, mounds, and, rock, carving, sites, from, the, period, numerous, artefacts, of, bronze, and, gold, are, found, no, written, language, existed, in, the, nordic, countries, during, the, bronze, age, the, rock, carvings, have, been, dated, through, comparison, with, depicted, artefacts, the, yamnaya, culture, c, 3300, 2600, bc, was, a, late, copper, age, early, bronze, age, culture, of, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, and, is, associated, with, early, indo, europeans, it, was, followed, on, the, steppe, by, the, catacomb, culture, c, 2800, 2200, bc, and, the, poltavka, culture, c, 2800, 2200, bc, the, closely, related, corded, ware, culture, in, the, forest, steppe, region, to, the, north, c, 3000, 2350, bc, spread, eastwards, with, the, fatyanovo, culture, c, 2900, 2050, bc, which, subsequently, developed, into, the, abashevo, culture, c, 2200, 1850, bc, and, the, sintashta, culture, c, 2200, 1750, bc, the, earliest, known, chariots, have, been, found, in, sintashta, burials, and, there, is, earlier, evidence, for, chariot, use, in, the, abashevo, culture, the, sintashta, culture, expanded, further, eastwards, into, central, asia, becoming, the, andronovo, culture, whilst, the, srubnaya, culture, c, 1900, 1200, bc, continued, the, use, of, chariots, in, eastern, europe, arsenical, bronze, artefacts, of, the, maykop, culture, in, the, north, caucasus, have, been, dated, to, around, the, 4th, millennium, bc, this, innovation, resulted, in, the, circulation, of, arsenical, bronze, technology, through, southern, and, eastern, europe, iron, and, copper, smelting, appeared, around, the, same, time, in, most, parts, of, africa, as, such, most, african, civilizations, outside, egypt, did, not, experience, a, distinct, bronze, age, evidence, for, iron, smelting, appears, earlier, or, at, the, same, time, as, copper, smelting, in, nigeria, c, 900, 800, bc, rwanda, and, burundi, c, 700, 500, bc, and, tanzania, c, 300, bc, there, is, a, longstanding, debate, about, whether, both, copper, and, iron, metallurgy, were, independently, developed, in, sub, saharan, africa, or, introduced, from, the, outside, across, the, sahara, desert, from, north, africa, or, the, indian, ocean, evidence, for, theories, of, independent, development, and, outside, introduction, are, scarce, and, the, subject, of, active, scholarly, debate, scholars, have, suggested, that, both, the, relative, dearth, of, archeological, research, in, sub, saharan, africa, as, well, as, long, standing, prejudices, have, limited, or, biased, our, understanding, of, pre, historic, metallurgy, on, the, continent, one, scholar, characterized, the, state, of, historical, knowledge, to, say, that, the, history, of, metallurgy, in, sub, saharan, africa, is, complicated, is, perhaps, an, understatement, copper, smelting, took, place, in, west, africa, prior, to, the, appearance, of, iron, smelting, in, the, region, evidence, for, copper, smelting, furnaces, was, found, near, agadez, niger, that, has, been, dated, as, early, as, 2200, bc, however, evidence, for, copper, production, in, this, region, before, 1000, bc, is, debated, evidence, of, copper, mining, and, smelting, has, been, found, at, akjoujt, mauretania, that, suggests, small, scale, production, c, 800, to, 400, bc, the, moche, civilization, of, south, america, independently, discovered, and, developed, bronze, smelting, bronze, technology, was, developed, further, by, the, incas, and, widely, used, both, for, utilitarian, objects, and, for, sculpture, a, later, appearance, of, limited, bronze, smelting, in, western, mexico, suggests, either, contact, of, that, region, with, andean, cultures, or, separate, discovery, of, the, technology, the, calchaqu, people, of, northwestern, argentina, had, bronze, technology, trade, and, industry, played, a, major, role, in, the, development, of, bronze, age, civilizations, with, artefacts, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, found, in, ancient, mesopotamia, and, egypt, it, is, clear, that, these, civilizations, were, not, only, in, touch, with, one, another, but, also, trading, early, long, distance, trade, was, limited, almost, exclusively, to, luxury, goods, like, spices, textiles, and, precious, metals, not, only, did, this, make, cities, with, ample, amounts, of, these, products, extremely, rich, but, it, also, led, to, an, intermingling, of, cultures, for, the, first, time, in, history, trade, routes, were, not, just, on, land, the, first, and, most, extensive, trade, routes, were, along, rivers, such, as, the, nile, the, tigris, and, the, euphrates, which, led, to, the, growth, of, cities, on, the, banks, of, these, rivers, the, later, domestication, of, camels, also, helped, encourage, trade, routes, overland, linking, the, indus, valley, with, the, mediterranean, this, further, led, to, towns, sprouting, up, everywhere, there, was, a, pit, stop, or, caravan, to, ship, port
