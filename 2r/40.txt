player, in, middle, eastern, and, global, geopolitics, the, earliest, archaeological, artifacts, in, iran, were, found, in, the, kashafrud, and, ganj, par, sites, that, are, thought, to, date, back, to, 10, 000, years, ago, in, the, middle, paleolithic, mousterian, stone, tools, made, by, neanderthals, have, also, been, found, there, are, more, cultural, remains, of, neanderthals, dating, back, to, the, middle, paleolithic, period, which, mainly, have, been, found, in, the, zagros, region, and, fewer, in, central, iran, at, sites, such, as, kobeh, kunji, bisitun, cave, tamtama, warwasi, and, yafteh, cave, in, 1949, a, neanderthal, radius, was, discovered, by, carleton, s, coon, in, bisitun, cave, evidence, for, upper, paleolithic, and, epipaleolithic, periods, are, known, mainly, from, the, zagros, mountains, in, the, caves, of, kermanshah, and, khorramabad, and, a, few, number, of, sites, in, piranshahr, and, alborz, and, central, iran, during, this, time, people, began, creating, rock, art, early, agricultural, communities, such, as, chogha, golan, in, 10, 000, bc, along, with, settlements, such, as, chogha, bonut, the, earliest, village, in, elam, in, 8000, bc, began, to, flourish, in, and, around, the, zagros, mountains, region, in, western, iran, around, about, the, same, time, the, earliest, known, clay, vessels, and, modelled, human, and, animal, terracotta, figurines, were, produced, at, ganj, dareh, also, in, western, iran, there, are, also, 10, 000, year, old, human, and, animal, figurines, from, tepe, sarab, in, kermanshah, province, among, many, other, ancient, artefacts, the, south, western, part, of, iran, was, part, of, the, fertile, crescent, where, most, of, humanity, s, first, major, crops, were, grown, in, villages, such, as, susa, where, a, settlement, was, first, founded, possibly, as, early, as, 4395, cal, bc, 46, 47, and, settlements, such, as, chogha, mish, dating, back, to, 6800, bc, there, are, 7, 000, year, old, jars, of, wine, excavated, in, the, zagros, mountains, now, on, display, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, and, ruins, of, 7000, year, old, settlements, such, as, tepe, sialk, are, further, testament, to, that, the, two, main, neolithic, iranian, settlements, were, ganj, dareh, and, the, hypothetical, zayandeh, river, culture, parts, of, what, is, modern, day, northwestern, iran, was, part, of, the, kura, araxes, culture, circa, 3400, bc, ca, 2000, bc, that, stretched, up, into, the, neighbouring, regions, of, the, caucasus, and, anatolia, susa, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, settlements, of, iran, and, the, world, based, on, c14, dating, the, time, of, the, foundation, of, the, city, is, as, early, as, 4395, bc, 45, 46, a, time, right, after, the, establishment, of, the, ancient, sumerian, city, of, uruk, in, 4500, bc, the, general, perception, among, archaeologists, is, that, susa, was, an, extension, of, the, sumerian, city, state, of, uruk, hence, incorporating, many, aspects, of, mesopotamian, culture, in, its, later, history, susa, became, the, capital, of, elam, which, emerged, as, a, state, founded, 4000, bc, 45, 46, there, are, also, dozens, of, prehistoric, sites, across, the, iranian, plateau, pointing, to, the, existence, of, ancient, cultures, and, urban, settlements, in, the, fourth, millennium, bc, one, of, the, earliest, civilizations, on, the, iranian, plateau, was, the, jiroft, culture, in, southeastern, iran, in, the, province, of, kerman, it, is, one, of, the, most, artefact, rich, archaeological, sites, in, the, middle, east, archaeological, excavations, in, jiroft, led, to, the, discovery, of, several, objects, belonging, to, the, 4th, millennium, bc, there, is, a, large, quantity, of, objects, decorated, with, highly, distinctive, engravings, of, animals, mythological, figures, and, architectural, motifs, the, objects, and, their, iconography, are, considered, unique, many, are, made, from, chlorite, a, grey, green, soft, stone, others, are, in, copper, bronze, terracotta, and, even, lapis, lazuli, recent, excavations, at, the, sites, have, produced, the, world, s, earliest, inscription, which, pre, dates, mesopotamian, inscriptions, there, are, records, of, numerous, other, ancient, civilizations, on, the, iranian, plateau, before, the, emergence, of, iranian, peoples, during, the, early, iron, age, the, early, bronze, age, saw, the, rise, of, urbanization, into, organized, city, states, and, the, invention, of, writing, the, uruk, period, in, the, near, east, while, bronze, age, elam, made, use, of, writing, from, an, early, time, the, proto, elamite, script, remains, undeciphered, and, records, from, sumer, pertaining, to, elam, are, scarce, russian, historian, igor, m, diakonoff, stated, that, the, modern, inhabitants, of, iran, are, descendants, of, mainly, non, indo, european, groups, more, specifically, of, pre, iranic, inhabitants, of, the, iranian, plateau, it, is, the, autochthones, of, the, iranian, plateau, and, not, the, proto, indo, european, tribes, of, europe, which, are, in, the, main, the, ancestors, in, the, physical, sense, of, the, word, of, the, present, day, iranians, records, become, more, tangible, with, the, rise, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, and, its, records, of, incursions, from, the, iranian, plateau, as, early, as, the, 20th, century, bc, tribes, came, to, the, iranian, plateau, from, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, the, arrival, of, iranians, on, the, iranian, plateau, forced, the, elamites, to, relinquish, one, area, of, their, empire, after, another, and, to, take, refuge, in, elam, khuzestan, and, the, nearby, area, which, only, then, became, coterminous, with, elam, bahman, firuzmandi, say, that, the, southern, iranians, might, be, intermixed, with, the, elamite, peoples, living, in, the, plateau, by, the, mid, first, millennium, bc, medes, persians, and, parthians, populated, the, iranian, plateau, until, the, rise, of, the, medes, they, all, remained, under, assyrian, domination, like, the, rest, of, the, near, east, in, the, first, half, of, the, first, millennium, bc, parts, of, what, is, now, iranian, azerbaijan, were, incorporated, into, urartu, in, 646, bc, assyrian, king, ashurbanipal, sacked, susa, which, ended, elamite, supremacy, in, the, region, for, over, 150, years, assyrian, kings, of, nearby, northern, mesopotamia, had, been, wanting, to, conquer, median, tribes, of, western, iran, under, pressure, from, assyria, the, small, kingdoms, of, the, western, iranian, plateau, coalesced, into, increasingly, larger, and, more, centralized, states, in, the, second, half, of, the, seventh, century, bc, the, medes, gained, their, independence, and, were, united, by, deioces, in, 612, bc, cyaxares, deioces, grandson, and, the, babylonian, king, nabopolassar, invaded, assyria, and, laid, siege, to, and, eventually, destroyed, nineveh, the, assyrian, capital, which, led, to, the, fall, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, urartu, was, later, on, conquered, and, dissolved, as, well, by, the, medes, the, medes, are, credited, with, founding, iran, as, a, nation, and, empire, and, established, the, first, iranian, empire, the, largest, of, its, day, until, cyrus, the, great, established, a, unified, empire, of, the, medes, and, persians, leading, to, the, achaemenid, empire, c, 550, 330, bc, cyrus, the, great, overthrew, in, turn, the, median, lydian, and, neo, babylonian, empires, creating, an, empire, far, larger, than, assyria, he, was, better, able, through, more, benign, policies, to, reconcile, his, subjects, to, persian, rule, the, longevity, of, his, empire, was, one, result, the, persian, king, like, the, assyrian, was, also, king, of, kings, x, ya, iya,

of, greece, at, a, crucial, moment, in, the, war, about, half, of, mainland, greece, was, overrun, by, the, persians, including, all, territories, to, the, north, of, the, isthmus, of, corinth, however, this, was, also, turned, out, in, a, greek, victory, following, the, battles, of, plataea, and, salamis, by, which, persia, lost, its, footholds, in, europe, and, eventually, withdrew, from, it, during, the, greco, persian, wars, the, persians, gained, major, territorial, advantages, they, captured, and, razed, athens, twice, once, in, 480, bc, and, again, in, 479, bc, however, after, a,

attack, the, empire, after, many, gains, the, sassanians, were, defeated, at, issus, constantinople, and, finally, nineveh, resulting, in, peace, with, the, conclusion, of, the, over, 700, years,

considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, and, influential, historical, periods, in, iran, and, had, a, major, impact, on, the, world, in, many, ways, the, sassanian, period, witnessed, the, highest, achievement, of, persian, civilization, and, constitutes, the, last, great, iranian, empire, before, the, adoption, of, islam, persia, influenced, roman, civilization, considerably, during, sassanian, times, their, cultural, influence, extending, far, beyond, the, empire, s, territorial, borders, reaching, as, far, as, western, europe, africa, china, and, india, and, also, playing, a, prominent, role, in, the, formation, of, both, european, and, asiatic, medieval, art, this, influence, carried, forward, to, the, muslim, world, the, dynasty, s, unique, and, aristocratic, culture, transformed, the, islamic, conquest, and, destruction, of, iran, into, a, persian, renaissance, much, of, what, later, became, known, as, islamic, culture, architecture, writing, and, other, contributions, to, civilization, were, taken, from, the, sassanian, persians, into, the, broader, muslim, world, in, 633, when, the, sasanian, king, yazdegerd, iii, was, ruling, over, iran, the, muslims, under, umar, invaded, the, country, right, after, it, had, been, in, a, bloody, civil, war, several, iranian, nobles, and, families, such, as, king, dinar, of, the, house, of, karen, and, later, kanarangiyans, of, khorasan, mutinied, against, their, sasanian, overlords, although, the, house, of, mihran, had, claimed, the, sasanian, throne, under, the, two, prominent, generals, bahr, m, ch, bin, and, shahrbaraz, it, remained, loyal, to, the, sasanians, during, their, struggle, against, the, arabs, but, the, mihrans, were, eventually, betrayed, and, defeated, by, their, own, kinsmen, the, house, of, ispahbudhan, under, their, leader, farrukhzad, who, had, mutinied, against, yazdegerd, iii, yazdegerd, iii, fled, from, one, district, to, another, until, a, local, miller, killed, him, for, his, purse, at, merv, in, 651, by, 674, muslims, had, conquered, greater, khorasan, which, included, modern, iranian, khorasan, province, and, modern, afghanistan, and, parts, of, transoxiana, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, ended, the, sasanian, empire, and, led, to, the, eventual, decline, of, the, zoroastrian, religion, in, persia, over, time, the, majority, of, iranians, converted, to, islam, most, of, the, aspects, of, the, previous, persian, civilizations, were, not, discarded, but, were, absorbed, by, the, new, islamic, polity, as, bernard, lewis, has, commented, these, events, have, been, variously, seen, in, iran, by, some, as, a, blessing, the, advent, of, the, true, faith, the, end, of, the, age, of, ignorance, and, heathenism, by, others, as, a, humiliating, national, defeat, the, conquest, and, subjugation, of, the, country, by, foreign, invaders, both, perceptions, are, of, course, valid, depending, on, one, s, angle, of, vision, after, the, fall, of, the, sasanian, empire, in, 651, the, arabs, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, adopted, many, persian, customs, especially, the, administrative, and, the, court, mannerisms, arab, provincial, governors, were, undoubtedly, either, persianized, arameans, or, ethnic, persians, certainly, persian, remained, the, language, of, official, business, of, the, caliphate, until, the, adoption, of, arabic, toward, the, end, of, the, seventh, century, when, in, 692, minting, began, at, the, capital, damascus, the, new, islamic, coins, evolved, from, imitations, of, sasanian, coins, as, well, as, byzantine, and, the, pahlavi, script, on, the, coinage, was, replaced, with, arabic, alphabet, during, the, umayyad, caliphate, the, arab, conquerors, imposed, arabic, as, the, primary, language, of, the, subject, peoples, throughout, their, empire, al, hajjaj, ibn, yusuf, who, was, not, happy, with, the, prevalence, of, the, persian, language, in, the, divan, ordered, the, official, language, of, the, conquered, lands, to, be, replaced, by, arabic, sometimes, by, force, in, al, biruni, s, from, the, remaining, signs, of, past, centuries, for, example, it, is, written, when, qutaibah, bin, muslim, under, the, command, of, al, hajjaj, bin, yousef, was, sent, to, khwarazmia, with, a, military, expedition, and, conquered, it, for, the, second, time, he, swiftly, killed, whoever, wrote, the, khwarazmian, native, language, that, knew, of, the, khwarazmian, heritage, history, and, culture, he, then, killed, all, their, zoroastrian, priests, and, burned, and, wasted, their, books, until, gradually, the, illiterate, only, remained, who, knew, nothing, of, writing, and, hence, their, history, was, mostly, forgotten, there, are, a, number, of, historians, who, see, the, rule, of, the, umayyads, as, setting, up, the, dhimmah, to, increase, taxes, from, the, dhimmis, to, benefit, the, muslim, arab, community, financially, and, by, discouraging, conversion, governors, lodged, complaints, with, the, caliph, when, he, enacted, laws, that, made, conversion, easier, depriving, the, provinces, of, revenues, in, the, 7th, century, when, many, non, arabs, such, as, persians, entered, islam, they, were, recognized, as, mawali, clients, and, treated, as, second, class, citizens, by, the, ruling, arab, elite, until, the, end, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, during, this, era, islam, was, initially, associated, with, the, ethnic, identity, of, the, arab, and, required, formal, association, with, an, arab, tribe, and, the, adoption, of, the, client, status, of, mawali, the, half, hearted, policies, of, the, late, umayyads, to, tolerate, non, arab, muslims, and, shias, had, failed, to, quell, unrest, among, these, minorities, however, all, of, iran, was, still, not, under, arab, control, and, the, region, of, daylam, was, under, the, control, of, the, daylamites, while, tabaristan, was, under, dabuyid, and, paduspanid, control, and, the, mount, damavand, region, under, masmughans, of, damavand, the, arabs, had, invaded, these, regions, several, times, but, achieved, no, decisive, result, because, of, the, inaccessible, terrain, of, the, regions, the, most, prominent, ruler, of, the, dabuyids, known, as, farrukhan, the, great, r, 712, 728, managed, to, hold, his, domains, during, his, long, struggle, against, the, arab, general, yazid, ibn, al, muhallab, who, was, defeated, by, a, combined, dailamite, dabuyid, army, and, was, forced, to, retreat, from, tabaristan, with, the, death, of, the, umayyad, caliph, hisham, ibn, abd, al, malik, in, 743, the, islamic, world, was, launched, into, civil, war, abu, muslim, was, sent, to, khorasan, by, the, abbasid, caliphate, initially, as, a, propagandist, and, then, to, revolt, on, their, behalf, he, took, merv, defeating, the, umayyad, governor, there, nasr, ibn, sayyar, he, became, the, de, facto, abbasid, governor, of, khurasan, during, the, same, period, the, dabuyid, ruler, khurshid, declared, independence, from, the, umayyads, but, was, shortly, forced, to, recognize, abbasid, authority, in, 750, abu, muslim, became, the, leader, of, the, abbasid, army, and, defeated, the, umayyads, at, the, battle, of, the, zab, abu, muslim, stormed, damascus, the, capital, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, later, that, year, the, abbasid, army, consisted, primarily, of, khorasanians, and, was, led, by, an, iranian, general, abu, muslim, khorasani, it, contained, both, iranian, and, arab, elements, and, the, abbasids, enjoyed, both, iranian, and, arab, support, the, abbasids, overthrew, the, umayyads, in, 750, according, to, amir, arjomand, the, abbasid, revolution, essentially, marked, the, end, of, the, arab, empire, and, the, beginning, of, a, more, inclusive, multi, ethnic, state, in, the, middle, east, one, of, the, first, changes, the, abbasids, made, after, taking, power, from, the, umayyads, was, to, move, the, empire, s, capital, from, damascus, in, the, levant, to, iraq, the, latter, region, was, influenced, by, persian, history, and, culture, and, moving, the, capital, was, part, of, the, persian, mawali, demand, for, arab, influence, in, the, empire, the, city, of, baghdad, was, constructed, on, the, tigris, river, in, 762, to, serve, as, the, new, abbasid, capital, the, abbasids, established, the, position, of, vizier, like, barmakids, in, their, administration, which, was, the, equivalent, of, a, vice, caliph, or, second, in, command, eventually, this, change, meant, that, many, caliphs, under, the, abbasids, ended, up, in, a, much, more, ceremonial, role, than, ever, before, with, the, vizier, in, real, power, a, new, persian, bureaucracy, began, to, replace, the, old, arab, aristocracy, and, the, entire, administration, reflected, these, changes, demonstrating, that, the, new, dynasty, was, different, in, many, ways, from, the, umayyads, by, the, 9th, century, abbasid, control, began, to, wane, as, regional, leaders, sprang, up, in, the, far, corners, of, the, empire, to, challenge, the, central, authority, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, the, abbasid, caliphs, began, enlisting, mamluks, turkic, speaking, warriors, who, had, been, moving, out, of, central, asia, into, transoxiana, as, slave, warriors, as, early, as, the, 9th, century, shortly, thereafter, the, real, power, of, the, abbasid, caliphs, began, to, wane, eventually, they, became, religious, figureheads, while, the, warrior, slaves, ruled, the, 9th, century, also, saw, the, revolt, by, native, zoroastrians, known, as, the, khurramites, against, oppressive, arab, rule, the, movement, was, led, by, a, persian, freedom, fighter, babak, khorramdin, babak, s, iranianizing, rebellion, from, its, base, in, azerbaijan, in, northwestern, iran, called, for, a, return, of, the, political, glories, of, the, iranian, past, the, khorramdin, rebellion, of, babak, spread, to, the, western, and, central, parts, of, iran, and, lasted, more, than, twenty, years, before, it, was, defeated, when, babak, was, betrayed, by, afshin, a, senior, general, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, as, the, power, of, the, abbasid, caliphs, diminished, a, series, of, dynasties, rose, in, various, parts, of, iran, some, with, considerable, influence, and, power, among, the, most, important, of, these, overlapping, dynasties, were, the, tahirids, in, khorasan, 821, 873, the, saffarids, in, sistan, 861, 1003, their, rule, lasted, as, maliks, of, sistan, until, 1537, and, the, samanids, 819, 1005, originally, at, bukhara, the, samanids, eventually, ruled, an, area, from, central, iran, to, pakistan, by, the, early, 10th, century, the, abbasids, almost, lost, control, to, the, growing, persian, faction, known, as, the, buyid, dynasty, 934, 1062, since, much, of, the, abbasid, administration, had, been, persian, anyway, the, buyids, were, quietly, able, to, assume, real, power, in, baghdad, the, buyids, were, defeated, in, the, mid, 11th, century, by, the, seljuq, turks, who, continued, to, exert, influence, over, the, abbasids, while, publicly, pledging, allegiance, to, them, the, balance, of, power, in, baghdad, remained, as, such, with, the, abbasids, in, power, in, name, only, until, the, mongol, invasion, of, 1258, sacked, the, city, and, definitively, ended, the, abbasid, dynasty, during, the, abbasid, period, an, enfranchisement, was, experienced, by, the, mawali, and, a, shift, was, made, in, political, conception, from, that, of, a, primarily, arab, empire, to, one, of, a, muslim, empire, and, c, 930, a, requirement, was, enacted, that, required, all, bureaucrats, of, the, empire, be, muslim, islamization, was, a, long, process, by, which, islam, was, gradually, adopted, by, the, majority, population, of, iran, richard, bulliet, s, conversion, curve, indicates, that, only, about, 10, of, iran, converted, to, islam, during, the, relatively, arab, centric, umayyad, period, beginning, in, the, abbasid, period, with, its, mix, of, persian, as, well, as, arab, rulers, the, muslim, percentage, of, the, population, rose, as, persian, muslims, consolidated, their, rule, of, the, country, the, muslim, population, rose, from, approximately, 40, in, the, mid, 9th, century, to, close, to, 90, by, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, seyyed, hossein, nasr, suggests, that, the, rapid, increase, in, conversion, was, aided, by, the, persian, nationality, of, the, rulers, although, persians, adopted, the, religion, of, their, conquerors, over, the, centuries, they, worked, to, protect, and, revive, their, distinctive, language, and, culture, a, process, known, as, persianization, arabs, and, turks, participated, in, this, attempt, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, non, arab, subjects, of, the, ummah, created, a, movement, called, shu, ubiyyah, in, response, to, the, privileged, status, of, arabs, most, of, those, behind, the, movement, were, persian, but, references, to, egyptians, berbers, and, aramaeans, are, attested, citing, as, its, basis, islamic, notions, of, equality, of, races, and, nations, the, movement, was, primarily, concerned, with, preserving, persian, culture, and, protecting, persian, identity, though, within, a, muslim, context, the, samanid, dynasty, led, the, revival, of, persian, culture, and, the, first, important, persian, poet, after, the, arrival, of, islam, rudaki, was, born, during, this, era, and, was, praised, by, samanid, kings, the, samanids, also, revived, many, ancient, persian, festivals, their, successor, the, ghaznawids, who, were, of, non, iranian, turkic, origin, also, became, instrumental, in, the, revival, of, persian, culture, the, culmination, of, the, persianization, movement, was, the, shahnameh, the, national, epic, of, iran, written, almost, entirely, in, persian, this, voluminous, work, reflects, iran, s, ancient, history, its, unique, cultural, values, its, pre, islamic, zoroastrian, religion, and, its, sense, of, nationhood, according, to, bernard, lewis, iran, was, indeed, islamized, but, it, was, not, arabized, persians, remained, persians, and, after, an, interval, of, silence, iran, re, emerged, as, a, separate, different, and, distinctive, element, within, islam, eventually, adding, a, new, element, even, to, islam, itself, culturally, politically, and, most, remarkable, of, all, even, religiously, the, iranian, contribution, to, this, new, islamic, civilization, is, of, immense, importance, the, work, of, iranians, can, be, seen, in, every, field, of, cultural, endeavour, including, arabic, poetry, to, which, poets, of, iranian, origin, composing, their, poems, in, arabic, made, a, very, significant, contribution, in, a, sense, iranian, islam, is, a, second, advent, of, islam, itself, a, new, islam, sometimes, referred, to, as, islam, i, ajam, it, was, this, persian, islam, rather, than, the, original, arab, islam, that, was, brought, to, new, areas, and, new, peoples, to, the, turks, first, in, central, asia, and, then, in, the, middle, east, in, the, country, which, came, to, be, called, turkey, and, of, course, to, india, the, ottoman, turks, brought, a, form, of, iranian, civilization, to, the, walls, of, vienna, the, islamization, of, iran, was, to, yield, deep, transformations, within, the, cultural, scientific, and, political, structure, of, iran, s, society, the, blossoming, of, persian, literature, philosophy, medicine, and, art, became, major, elements, of, the, newly, forming, muslim, civilization, inheriting, a, heritage, of, thousands, of, years, of, civilization, and, being, at, the, crossroads, of, the, major, cultural, highways, contributed, to, persia, emerging, as, what, culminated, into, the, islamic, golden, age, during, this, period, hundreds, of, scholars, and, scientists, vastly, contributed, to, technology, science, and, medicine, later, influencing, the, rise, of, european, science, during, the, renaissance, the, most, important, scholars, of, almost, all, of, the, islamic, sects, and, schools, of, thought, were, persian, or, lived, in, iran, including, the, most, notable, and, reliable, hadith, collectors, of, shia, and, sunni, like, shaikh, saduq, shaikh, kulainy, hakim, al, nishaburi, imam, muslim, and, imam, bukhari, the, greatest, theologians, of, shia, and, sunni, like, shaykh, tusi, imam, ghazali,

and, established, a, dynasty, the, ghaznavids, that, lasted, to, 1186, the, ghaznavid, empire, grew, by, taking, all, of, the, samanid, territories, south, of, the, amu, darya, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 10th, century, and, eventually, occupied, parts, of, eastern, iran, afghanistan, pakistan, and, north, west, india, the, ghaznavids, are, generally, credited, with, launching, islam, into, a, mainly, hindu, india, the, invasion, of, india, was, undertaken, in, 1000, by, the, ghaznavid, ruler, mahmud, and, continued, for, several, years, they, were, unable, to, hold, power, for, long, however, particularly, after, the, death, of, mahmud, in, 1030, by, 1040, the, seljuqs, had, taken, over, the, ghaznavid, lands, in, iran, the, seljuqs, who, like, the, ghaznavids, were, persianate, in, nature, and, of, turkic, origin, slowly, conquered, iran, over, the, course, of, the, 11th, century, the, dynasty, had, its, origins, in, the, turcoman, tribal, confederations, of, central, asia, and, marked, the, beginning, of, turkic, power, in, the, middle, east, they, established, a, sunni, muslim, rule, over, parts, of, central, asia, and, the, middle, east, from, the, 11th, to, 14th, centuries, they, set, up, an, empire, known, as, great, seljuq, empire, that, stretched, from, anatolia, in, the, west, to, western, afghanistan, in, the, east, and, the, western, borders, of, modern, day, china, in, the, north, east, and, was, the, target, of, the, first, crusade, today, they, are, regarded, as, the, cultural, ancestors, of, the, western, turks, the, present, day, inhabitants, of, turkey, azerbaijan, and, turkmenistan, and, they, are, remembered, as, great, patrons, of, persian, culture, art, literature, and, language, the, founder, of, the, dynasty, tughril, beg, turned, his,

officials, several, of, the, various, theories, on, the, etymology, of, the, word, assassin, derive, from, these, killers, parts, of, northwestern, iran, were, conquered, in, the, early, 13th, century, ad, by, the, kingdom, of, georgia, led, by, tamar, the, great, the, khwarazmian, dynasty, only, lasted, for, a, few, decades, until, the, arrival, of, the, mongols, genghis, khan, had, unified, the, mongols, and, under, him, the, mongol, empire, quickly, expanded, in, several, directions, in, 1218, it, bordered, khwarezm, at, that, time, the, khwarazmian, empire, was, ruled, by, ala, ad, din, muhammad, 1200, 1220, muhammad, like, genghis, was, intent, on, expanding, his, lands, and, had, gained, the, submission, of, most, of, iran, he, declared, himself, shah, and, demanded, formal, recognition, from, the, abbasid, caliph, al, nasir, when, the, caliph, rejected, his, claim, ala, ad, din, muhammad, proclaimed, one, of, his, nobles, caliph, and, unsuccessfully, tried, to,

chinese, who, were, familiar, with, gunpowder, were, serving, in, genghis, s, army, whole, regiments, entirely, made, out, of, chinese, were, used, by, the, mongols, to, command, bomb, hurling, trebuchets, during, the, invasion, of, iran, historians, have, suggested, that, the, mongol, invasion, had, brought, chinese, gunpowder, weapons, to, central, asia, one, of, these, was, the, huochong, a, chinese, mortar, books, written, around, the, area, afterward, depicted, gunpowder, weapons, which, resembled, those, of, china, before, his, death, in, 1227, genghis, had, reached, western, azerbaijan, pillaging, and, burning, many, cities, along, the, way, after, entering, into, iran, from, its, north, east, the, mongol, invasion, was, by, and, large, disastrous, to, the, iranians,

civilians, destruction, of, qanat, irrigation, systems, in, the, north, east, of, iran, destroyed, the, pattern, of, relatively, continuous, settlements, producing, many, abandoned, towns, which, were, relatively, quite, good, with, irrigation, and, agriculture, after, genghis, s, death, iran, was, ruled, by, several, mongol, commanders, genghis, grandson, hulagu, khan, was, tasked, with, the, westward, expansion, of, mongol, dominion, however, by, the, time, he, ascended, to, power, the, mongol, empire, had, already, dissolved, dividing, into, different, factions, arriving, with, an, army, he, established, himself, in, the, region, and, founded, the, ilkhanate, a, breakaway, state, of, the, mongol, empire, which, would, rule, iran, for, the, next, eighty, years, and, become, persian, in, the, process, hulagu, khan, seized, baghdad, in, 1258, and, put, the, last, abbasid, caliph, to, death, the, westward, advance, of, his, forces, was, stopped, by, the, mamelukes, however, at, the,

and, iran, passed, easily, across, the, asian, steppes, and, these, contacts, culturally, enriched, iran, for, example, iranians, developed, a, new, style, of, painting, based, on, a, unique, fusion, of, solid, two, dimensional, mesopotamian, painting, with, the, feathery, light, brush, strokes, and, other, motifs, characteristic, of, china, after, ghazan, s, nephew, abu, said, died, in, 1335,

ismail, i, founded, the, safavid, dynasty, and, initiated, a, religious, policy, to, recognize, shi, a, islam, as, the, official, religion, of, the, safavid, empire, and, the, fact, that, modern, iran, remains, an, officially, shi, ite, state, is, a, direct, result, of, ismail, s, actions, iran, remained, divided, until, the, arrival, of, timur, a, turco, mongol, belonging, to, the, timurid,

by, tyranny, and, bloodshed, but, also, by, its, inclusion, of, iranians, in, administrative, roles, and, its, promotion, of, architecture, and, poetry, his, successors, the, timurids, maintained, a,

language, of, sufism, developed, over, hundreds, of, years, in, his, own, work, and, he, is, sometimes, credited, with, having, brought, it, to, perfection, his, work, was, imitated, by, jami, whose,

school, of, shi, a, islam, as, the, official, religion, of, their, empire, marking, one, of, the, most, important, turning, points, in, muslim, history, the, safavids, ruled, from, 1501, to, 1722, experiencing, a, brief, restoration, from, 1729, to, 1736, and, at, their, height, they, controlled, all, of, modern, iran, azerbaijan, and, armenia, most, of, georgia, the, north, caucasus, iraq,

its, archrival, and, principal, enemy, the, ottoman, empire, as, well, as, the, mughal, empire, the, safavid, ruling, dynasty, was, founded, by, ism, il, who, styled, himself, sh, h, ism, il, i, practically, worshipped, by, his, qizilb, sh, followers, ism, il, invaded, shirvan, to, avenge, the, death, of, his, father, shaykh, haydar, who, had, been, killed, during, his, siege, of, derbent, in, dagestan, afterwards, he, went, on, a, campaign, of, conquest, and, following, the, capture, of, tabriz, in, july, 1501, he, enthroned, himself, as, the, sh, h, of, iran, 324, minted, coins, in, this, name, and, proclaimed, shi, ism, the, official, religion, of, his, domain, although, initially, the, masters, of, azerbaijan, and, southern, dagestan, only, the, safavids, had, in, fact, won, the, struggle, for, power, in, persia, which, had, been, going, on, for, nearly, a, century, between, various, dynasties, and, political, forces, following, the, fragmentation, of, the, kara, koyunlu, and, the, aq, qoyunlu, a, year, after, his, victory, in, tabriz, ism, il, proclaimed, most, of, persia, as, his, domain, and, quickly, conquered, and, unified, iran, under, his, rule, soon, afterwards, the, new, safavid, empire, rapidly, conquered, regions, nations, and, peoples, in, all, directions, including, armenia, azerbaijan, parts, of, georgia, mesopotamia, iraq, kuwait, syria, dagestan, large, parts, of, what, is, now, afghanistan, parts, of, turkmenistan, and, large, chunks, of, anatolia, laying, the, foundation, of, its, multi, ethnic, character, which, would, heavily, influence, the, empire, itself, most, notably, the, caucasus, and, its, peoples, tahmasp, i, the, son, and, successor, of, ismail, i, carried, out, multiple, invasions, in, the, caucasus, which, had, been, incorporated, in, the, safavid, empire, since, shah, ismail, i, and, for, many, centuries, afterwards, and, started, with, the, trend, of, deporting, and, moving, hundreds, of, thousands, of, circassians, georgians, and, armenians, to, iran, s, heartlands, initially, only, solely, put, in, the, royal, harems, royal, guards, and, minor, other, sections, of, the, empire, tahmasp, believed, he, could, eventually, reduce, the, power, of, the, qizilbash, by, creating, and, fully, integrating, a, new, layer, in, iranian, society, as, encyclop, dia, iranica, states, for, tahmasp, the, problem, circled, around, the, military, tribal, elite, of, the, empire, the, qizilbash, who, believed, that, physical, proximity, to, and, control, of, a, member, of, the, immediate, safavid, family, guaranteed, spiritual, advantages, political, fortune, and, material, advancement, with, this, new, caucasian, layer, in, iranian, society, the, undisputed, might, of, the, qizilbash, who, functioned, much, like, the, ghazis, of, the, neighbouring, ottoman, empire, would, be, questioned, and, fully, diminished, as, society, would, become, fully, meritocratic, shah, abbas, i, and, his, successors, would, significantly, expand, this, policy, and, plan, initiated, by, tahmasp, deporting, during, his, reign, alone, around, some, 200, 000, georgians, 300, 000, armenians, and, 100, 000, 150, 000, circassians, to, iran, completing, the, foundation, of, a, new, layer, in, iranian, society, with, this, and, the, complete, systematic, disorganisation, of, the, qizilbash, by, his, personal, orders, he, eventually, fully, succeeded, in, replacing, the, power, of, the, qizilbash, with, that, of, the, caucasian, ghulams, these, new, caucasian, elements, the, so, called, ghilman, servants, almost, always, after, conversion, to, shi, ism, depending, on, given, function, would, be, unlike, the, qizilbash, fully, loyal, only, to, the, shah, the, other, masses, of, caucasians, were, deployed, in, all, other, possible, functions, and, positions, available, in, the, empire, as, well, as, in, the, harem, regular, military, craftsmen, farmers, etc, this, system, of, mass, usage, of, caucasian, subjects, remained, to, exist, until, the, fall, of, the, qajar, dynasty, the, greatest, of, the, safavid, monarchs, shah, abbas, i, the, great, 1587, 1629, came, to, power, in, 1587, aged, 16, abbas, i, first, fought, the, uzbeks, recapturing, herat, and, mashhad, in, 1598, which, had, been, lost, by, his, predecessor, mohammad, khodabanda, by, the, ottoman, safavid, war, 1578, 1590, then, he, turned, against, the, ottomans, the, archrivals, of, the, safavids, recapturing, baghdad, eastern, iraq, the, caucasian, provinces, and, beyond, by, 1618, between, 1616, and, 1618, following, the, disobedience, of, his, most, loyal, georgian, subjects, teimuraz, i, and, luarsab, ii, abbas, carried, out, a, punitive, campaign, in, his, territories, of, georgia, devastating, kakheti, and, tbilisi, and, carrying, away, 130, 000, 200, 000, georgian, captives, towards, mainland, iran, his, new, army, which, had, dramatically, been, improved, with, the, advent, of, robert, shirley, and, his, brothers, following, the, first, diplomatic, mission, to, europe, pitted, the, first, crushing, victory, over, the, safavids, archrivals, the, ottomans, in, the, above, mentioned, 1603, 1618, war, and, would, surpass, the, ottomans, in, military, strength, he, also, used, his, new, force, to, dislodge, the, portuguese, from, bahrain, 1602, and, hormuz, 1622, with, aid, of, the, english, navy, in, the, persian, gulf, he, expanded, commercial, links, with, the, dutch, east, india, company, and, established, firm, links, with, the, european, royal, houses, which, had, been, initiated, by, ismail, i, earlier, on, by, the, habsburg, persian, alliance, thus, abbas, i, was, able, to, break, the, dependence, on, the, qizilbash, for, military, might, and, therefore, was, able, to, centralize, control, the, safavid, dynasty, had, already, established, itself, during, shah, ismail, i, but, under, abbas, i, it, really, became, a, major, power, in, the, world, along, with, its, archrival, the, ottoman, empire, against, whom, it, became, able, to, compete, with, on, equal, foot, it, also, started, the, promotion, of, tourism, in, iran, under, their, rule, persian, architecture, flourished, again, and, saw, many, new, monuments, in, various, iranian, cities, of, which, isfahan, is, the, most, notable, example, except, for, shah, abbas, the, great, shah, ismail, i, shah, tahmasp, i, and, shah, abbas, ii, many, of, the, safavid, rulers, were, ineffectual, often, being, more, interested, in, their, women, alcohol, and, other, leisure, activities, the, end, of, abbas, ii, s, reign, in, 1666, marked, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, the, safavid, dynasty, despite, falling, revenues, and, military, threats, many, of, the, later, shahs, had, lavish, lifestyles, shah, soltan, hosain, 1694, 1722, in, particular, was, known, for, his, love, of, wine, and, disinterest, in, governance, the, declining, country, was, repeatedly, raided, on, its, frontiers, finally, ghilzai, pashtun, chieftain, named, mir, wais, khan, began, a, rebellion, in, kandahar, and, defeated, the, safavid, army, under, the, iranian, georgian, governor, over, the, region, gurgin, khan, in, 1722, peter, the, great, of, neighbouring, imperial, russia, launched, the, russo, persian, war, 1722, 1723, capturing, many, of, iran, s, caucasian, territories, including, derbent, shaki, baku, but, also, gilan, mazandaran, and, astrabad, in, the, midst, of, chaos, in, the, same, year, of, 1722, an, afghan, army, led, by, mir, wais, son, mahmud, marched, across, eastern, iran, besieged, and, took, isfahan, mahmud, proclaimed, himself, shah, of, persia, meanwhile, persia, s, imperial, rivals, the, ottomans, and, the, russians, took, advantage, of, the, chaos, in, the, country, to, seize, more, territory, for, themselves, by, these, events, the, safavid, dynasty, had, effectively, ended, in, 1724, conform, the, treaty, of, constantinople, the, ottomans, and, the, russians, agreed, to, divide, the, newly, conquered, territories, of, iran, amongst, themselves, iran, s, territorial, integrity, was, restored, by, a, native, iranian, turkic, afshar, warlord, from, khorasan, nader, shah, he, defeated, and, banished, the, afghans, defeated, the, ottomans, reinstalled, the, safavids, on, the, throne, and, negotiated, russian, withdrawal, from, iran, s, caucasian, territories, with, the, treaty, of, resht, and, treaty, of, ganja, by, 1736, nader, had, become, so, powerful, he, was, able, to, depose, the, safavids, and, have, himself, crowned, shah, nader, was, one, of, the, last, great, conquerors, of, asia, and, briefly, presided, over, what, was, probably, the, most, powerful, empire, in, the, world, to, financially, support, his, wars, against, persia, s, arch, rival, the, ottoman, empire, he, fixed, his, sights, on, the, weak, but, rich, mughal, empire, to, the, east, in, 1739, accompanied, by, his, loyal, caucasian, subjects, including, erekle, ii, 55, he, invaded, mughal, india, defeated, a, numerically, superior, mughal, army, in, less, than, three, hours, and, completely, sacked, and, looted, delhi, bringing, back, immense, wealth, to, persia, on, his, way, back, he, also, conquered, all, the, uzbek, khanates, except, for, kokand, and, made, the, uzbeks, his, vassals, he, also, firmly, re, established, persian, rule, over, the, entire, caucasus, bahrain, as, well, as, large, parts, of, anatolia, and, mesopotamia, undefeated, for, years, his, defeat, in, dagestan, following, guerrilla, rebellions, by, the, lezgins, and, the, assassination, attempt, on, him, near, mazandaran, is, often, considered, the, turning, point, in, nader, s, impressive, career, to, his, frustration, the, dagestanis, resorted, to, guerrilla, warfare, and, nader, with, his, conventional, army, could, make, little, headway, against, them, at, the, battle, of, andalal, and, the, battle, of, avaria, nader, s, army, was, crushingly, defeated, and, he, lost, half, of, his, entire, force, as, well, forcing, him, to, flee, for, the, mountains, though, nader, managed, to, take, most, of, dagestan, during, his, campaign, the, effective, guerrilla, warfare, as, deployed, by, the, lezgins, but, also, the, avars, and, laks, made, the, iranian, re, conquest, of, the, particular, north, caucasian, region, this, time, a, short, lived, one, several, years, later, nader, was, forced, to, withdraw, around, the, same, time, the, assassination, attempt, was, made, on, him, near, mazandaran, which, accelerated, the, course, of, history, he, slowly, grew, ill, and, megalomaniac, blinding, his, sons, whom, he, suspected, of, the, assassination, attempts, and, showing, increasing, cruelty, against, his, subjects, and, officers, in, his, later, years, this, eventually, provoked, multiple, revolts, and, ultimately, nader, s, assassination, in, 1747, nader, s, death, was, followed, by, a, period, of, anarchy, in, iran, as, rival, army, commanders, fought, for, power, nader, s, own, family, the, afsharids, were, soon, reduced, to, holding, on, to, a, small, domain, in, khorasan, many, of, the, caucasian, territories, broke, away, in, various, caucasian, khanates, ottomans, regained, lost, territories, in, anatolia, and, mesopotamia, oman, and, the, uzbek, khanates, of, bukhara, and, khiva, regained, independence, ahmad, shah, durrani, one, of, nader, s, officers, founded, an, independent, state, which, eventually, became, modern, afghanistan, erekle, ii, and, teimuraz, ii, who, in, 1744, had, been, made, the, kings, of, kakheti, and, kartli, respectively, by, nader, himself, for, their, loyal, service, 55, capitalized, on, the, eruption, of, instability, and, declared, de, facto, independence, erekle, ii, assumed, control, over, kartli, after, teimuraz, ii, s, death, thus, unifying, the, two, as, the, kingdom, of, kartli, kakheti, becoming, the, first, georgian, ruler, in, three, centuries, to, preside, over, a, politically, unified, eastern, georgia, and, due, to, the, frantic, turn, of, events, in, mainland, iran, he, would, be, able, to, remain, de, facto, autonomous, through, the, zand, period, from, his, capital, shiraz, karim, khan, of, the, zand, dynasty, ruled, an, island, of, relative, calm, and, peace, in, an, otherwise, bloody, and, destructive, period, however, the, extent, of, zand, power, was, confined, to, contemporary, iran, and, parts, of, the, caucasus, karim, khan, s, death, in, 1779, led, to, yet, another, civil, war, in, which, the, qajar, dynasty, eventually, triumphed, and, became, kings, of, iran, during, the, civil, war, iran, permanently, lost, basra, in, 1779, to, the, ottomans, which, had, been, captured, during, the, ottoman, persian, war, 1775, 76, and, bahrain, to, al, khalifa, family, after, bani, utbah, invasion, in, 1783, agha, mohammad, khan, emerged, victorious, out, of, the, civil, war, that, commenced, with, the, death, of, the, last, zand, king, his, reign, is, noted, for, the, reemergence, of, a, centrally, led, and, united, iran, after, the, death, of, nader, shah, and, the, last, of, the, zands, most, of, iran, s, caucasian, territories, had, broken, away, into, various, caucasian, khanates, agha, mohammad, khan, like, the, safavid, kings, and, nader, shah, before, him, viewed, the, region, as, no, different, from, the, territories, in, mainland, iran, therefore, his, first, objective, after, having, secured, mainland, iran, was, to, reincorpate, the, caucasus, region, into, iran, georgia, was, seen, as, one, of, the, most, integral, territories, for, agha, mohammad, khan, the, resubjugation, and, reintegration, of, georgia, into, the, iranian, empire, was, part, of, the, same, process, that, had, brought, shiraz, isfahan, and, tabriz, under, his, rule, as, the, cambridge, history, of, iran, states, its, permanent, secession, was, inconceivable, and, had, to, be, resisted, in, the, same, way, as, one, would, resist, an, attempt, at, the, separation, of, fars, or, gilan, it, was, therefore, natural, for, agha, mohammad, khan, to, perform, whatever, necessary, means, in, the, caucasus, in, order, to, subdue, and, reincorporate, the, recently, lost, regions, following, nader, shah, s, death, and, the, demise, of, the, zands, including, putting, down, what, in, iranian, eyes, was, seen, as, treason, on, the, part, of, the, wali, viceroy, of, georgia, namely, the, georgian, king, erekle, ii, heraclius, ii, who, was, appointed, viceroy, of, georgia, by, nader, shah, himself, agha, mohammad, khan, subsequently, demanded, that, heraclius, ii, renounce, its, 1783, treaty, with, russia, and, to, submit, again, to, persian, suzerainty, in, return, for, peace, and, the, security, of, his, kingdom, the, ottomans, iran, s, neighboring, rival, recognized, the, latter, s, rights, over, kartli, and, kakheti, for, the, first, time, in, four, centuries, heraclius, appealed, then, to, his, theoretical, protector, empress, catherine, ii, of, russia, pleading, for, at, least, 3, 000, russian, troops, but, he, was, ignored, leaving, georgia, to, fend, off, the, persian, threat, alone, nevertheless, heraclius, ii, still, rejected, the, khan, s, ultimatum, as, a, response, agha, mohammad, khan, invaded, the, caucasus, region, after, crossing, the, aras, river, and, while, on, his, way, to, georgia, he, re, subjugated, iran, s, territories, of, the, erivan, khanate, shirvan, nakhchivan, khanate, ganja, khanate, derbent, khanate, baku, khanate, talysh, khanate, shaki, khanate, karabakh, khanate, which, comprise, modern, day, armenia, azerbaijan, dagestan, and, igdir, having, reached, georgia, with, his, large, army, he, prevailed, in, the, battle, of, krtsanisi, which, resulted, in, the, capture, and, sack, of, tbilisi, as, well, as, the, effective, resubjugation, of, georgia, upon, his, return, from, his, successful, campaign, in, tbilisi, and, in, effective, control, over, georgia, together, with, some, 15, 000, georgian, captives, that, were, moved, back, to, mainland, iran, agha, mohammad, was, formally, crowned, shah, in, 1796, in, the, mughan, plain, just, as, his, predecessor, nader, shah, was, about, sixty, years, earlier, agha, mohammad, shah, was, later, assassinated, while, preparing, a, second, expedition, against, georgia, in, 1797, in, shusha, now, part, of, the, republic, of, azerbaijan, and, the, seasoned, king, heraclius, died, early, in, 1798, the, reassertion, of, iranian, hegemony, over, georgia, did, not, last, long, in, 1799, the, russians, marched, into, tbilisi, the, russians, were, already, actively, occupied, with, an, expansionist, policy, towards, its, neighboring, empires, to, its, south, namely, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, successive, iranian, kingdoms, since, the, late, 17th, early, 18th, century, the, next, two, years, following, russia, s, entrance, into, tbilisi, were, a, time, of, confusion, and, the, weakened, and, devastated, georgian, kingdom, with, its, capital, half, in, ruins, was, easily, absorbed, by, russia, in, 1801, as, iran, could, not, permit, or, allow, the, cession, of, transcaucasia, and, dagestan, which, had, been, an, integral, part, of, iran, for, centuries, this, would, lead, directly, to, the, wars, of, several, years, later, namely, the, russo, persian, wars, of, 1804, 1813, and, 1826, 1828, the, outcome, of, these, two, wars, in, the, treaty, of, gulistan, and, the, treaty, of, turkmenchay, respectively, proved, for, the, irrevocable, forced, cession, and, loss, of, what, is, now, eastern, georgia, dagestan, armenia, and, azerbaijan, to, imperial, russia, the, area, to, the, north, of, the, river, aras, among, which, the, territory, of, the, contemporary, republic, of, azerbaijan, eastern, georgia, dagestan, and, armenia, were, iranian, territory, until, they, were, occupied, by, russia, in, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, following, the, official, loss, of, vast, territories, in, the, caucasus, major, demographic, shifts, were, bound, to, take, place, following, the, 1804, 1814, war, but, also, per, the, 1826, 1828, war, which, ceded, the, last, territories, large, migrations, so, called, caucasian, muhajirs, set, off, to, migrate, to, mainland, iran, some, of, these, groups, included, the, ayrums, qarapapaqs, circassians, shia, lezgins, and, other, transcaucasian, muslims, after, the, battle, of, ganja, of, 1804, during, the, russo, persian, war, 1804, 1813, many, thousands, of, ayrums, and, qarapapaqs, were, settled, in, tabriz, during, the, remaining, part, of, the, 1804, 1813, war, as, well, as, through, the, 1826, 1828, war, a, large, number, of, the, ayrums, and, qarapapaqs, that, were, still, remaining, in, newly, conquered, russian, territories, were, settled, in, and, migrated, to, solduz, in, modern, day, iran, s, west, azerbaijan, province, as, the, cambridge, history, of, iran, states, the, steady, encroachment, of, russian, troops, along, the, frontier, in, the, caucasus, general, yermolov, s, brutal, punitive, expeditions, and, misgovernment, drove, large, numbers, of, muslims, and, even, some, georgian,

leader, ayatollah, ali, khamenei, led, to, an, uneasy, alliance, between, him, and, president, akbar, hashemi, rafsanjani, through, this, alliance, they, attempted, to, hinder, the, ulama, s, ability, to, gain, further, control, of, the, state, in, 1989, they, created, a, sequence, of, constitutional, amendments, that, removed, the, office, of, prime, minister, and, increased, the, scope, of, presidential, power, however, these, new, amendments, did, not, curtail, the, powers, of, the, supreme, leader, of, iran, in, any, way, this, position, still, contained, the, ultimate, authority, over, the, armed, forces, the, making, of, war, and, peace, the, final, say, in, foreign, policy, and, the, right, to, intervene, in, the, legislative, process, whenever, he, deemed, it, necessary, president, rafsanjani, s, economic, policies, led, to, stronger, relations, with, the, outside, world, but, his, government, s, relaxation, of, the, enforcement, of, certain, regulations, on, social, behavior, were, met, with, some, responses, of, widespread, disenchantment, among, the, general, population, with, the, ulama, as, rulers, of, the, country, this, led, to, the, defeat, of, the, government, s, candidate, for, president, in, 1997, who, had, the, backing, of, the, supreme, islamic, jurist, he, was, beaten, by, an, independent, candidate, from, the, reformists, mohammad, khatami, he, received, 69, of, the, vote, and, enjoyed, particular, support, from, two, groups, of, the, population, that, had, felt, ostracized, by, the, practices, of, the, state, women, and, youth, the, younger, generations, in, the, country, had, been, too, young, to, experience, the, shah, s, regime, or, the, revolution, that, ended, it, and, now, they, resented, the, restrictions, placed, on, their, daily, lives, under, the, islamic, republic, mohammad, khatami, s, presidency, was, soon, marked, by, tensions, between, the, reform, minded, government, and, an, increasingly, conservative, and, vocal, clergy, this, rift, reached, a, climax, in, july, 1999, when, massive, anti, government, protests, erupted, in, the, streets, of, tehran, the, disturbances, lasted, over, a, week, before,

conservative, elements, within, iran, s, government, moved, to, undermine, the, reformist, movement, banning, liberal, newspapers, and, disqualifying, candidates, for, parliamentary, elections, this, clampdown, on, dissent, combined, with, the, failure, of, khatami, to, reform, the, government, led, to, growing, political, apathy, among, iran, s, youth, in, june, 2003, anti, government, protests,
