the, cold, war, was, a, period, of, geopolitical, tension, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, and, their, respective, allies, the, western, bloc, and, the, eastern, bloc, that, started, in, 1947, two, years, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, and, lasted, until, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, the, term, cold, war, is, used, because, there, was, no, large, scale, fighting, directly, between, the, two, superpowers, but, they, each, supported, opposing, sides, in, major, regional, conflicts, known, as, proxy, wars, the, cold, war, was, based, on, an, ideological, and, geopolitical, struggle, for, global, influence, by, these, two, superpowers, following, their, roles, as, the, allies, of, world, war, ii, that, led, to, victory, against, nazi, germany, and, imperial, japan, in, 1945, aside, from, the, nuclear, arms, race, and, conventional, military, deployment, the, struggle, for, dominance, was, expressed, indirectly, such, as, psychological, warfare, propaganda, campaigns, espionage, far, reaching, embargoes, sports, diplomacy, and, technological, competitions, like, the, space, race, the, cold, war, began, with, the, announcement, of, the, truman, doctrine, in, 1947, started, a, gradual, winding, down, with, the, sino, soviet, split, between, the, soviets, and, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1961, and, ended, with, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, the, western, bloc, was, led, by, the, united, states, as, well, as, a, number, of, first, world, nations, that, were, generally, capitalist, and, liberal, democratic, but, tied, to, a, network, of, often, authoritarian, third, world, states, most, of, which, were, the, european, powers, former, colonies, the, eastern, bloc, was, led, by, the, soviet, union, and, its, communist, party, which, had, an, influence, across, the, second, world, and, was, also, tied, to, a, network, of, authoritarian, states, the, soviet, union, had, a, command, economy, and, installed, similarly, communist, regimes, in, its, satellite, states, united, states, involvement, in, regime, change, during, the, cold, war, included, support, for, anti, communist, and, right, wing, dictatorships, governments, and, uprisings, across, the, world, while, soviet, involvement, in, regime, change, included, the, funding, of, left, wing, parties, wars, of, independence, revolutions, and, dictatorships, around, the, world, as, nearly, all, the, colonial, states, underwent, decolonization, and, achieved, independence, in, the, period, from, 1945, to, 1960, many, became, third, world, battlefields, in, the, cold, war, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, english, writer, george, orwell, used, cold, war, as, a, general, term, in, his, essay, you, and, the, atomic, bomb, published, 19, october, 1945, in, the, british, newspaper, tribune, contemplating, a, world, living, in, the, shadow, of, the, threat, of, nuclear, warfare, orwell, looked, at, james, burnham, s, predictions, of, a, polarized, world, writing, looking, at, the, world, as, a, whole, the, drift, for, many, decades, has, been, not, towards, anarchy, but, towards, the, reimposition, of, slavery, james, burnham, s, theory, has, been, much, discussed, but, few, people, have, yet, considered, its, ideological, implications, that, is, the, kind, of, world, view, the, kind, of, beliefs, and, the, social, structure, that, would, probably, prevail, in, a, state, which, was, at, once, unconquerable, and, in, a, permanent, state, of, cold, war, with, its, neighbours, in, the, observer, of, 10, march, 1946, orwell, wrote, after, the, moscow, conference, last, december, russia, began, to, make, a, cold, war, on, britain, and, the, british, empire, the, first, use, of, the, term, to, describe, the, specific, post, war, geopolitical, confrontation, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, came, in, a, speech, by, bernard, baruch, an, influential, advisor, to, democratic, presidents, on, 16, april, 1947, the, speech, written, by, journalist, herbert, bayard, swope, proclaimed, let, us, not, be, deceived, we, are, today, in, the, midst, of, a, cold, war, newspaper, columnist, walter, lippmann, gave, the, term, wide, currency, with, his, book, the, cold, war, when, asked, in, 1947, about, the, source, of, the, term, lippmann, traced, it, to, a, french, term, from, the, 1930s, la, guerre, froide, the, first, phase, of, the, cold, war, began, shortly, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1945, the, united, states, and, its, western, european, allies, sought, to, strengthen, their, bonds, and, used, the, policy, of, containment, against, soviet, influence, they, accomplished, this, most, notably, through, the, formation, of, nato, which, was, essentially, a, defensive, agreement, in, 1949, the, soviet, union, countered, with, the, warsaw, pact, in, 1955, which, had, similar, results, with, the, eastern, bloc, as, by, that, time, the, soviet, union, already, had, an, armed, presence, and, political, domination, all, over, its, eastern, satellite, states, the, pact, has, been, long, considered, superfluous, although, nominally, a, defensive, alliance, the, warsaw, pact, s, primary, function, was, to, safeguard, soviet, hegemony, over, its, eastern, european, satellites, with, the, pact, s, only, direct, military, actions, having, been, the, invasions, of, its, own, member, states, to, keep, them, from, breaking, away, in, the, 1960s, the, pact, evolved, into, a, multilateral, alliance, in, which, the, non, soviet, warsaw, pact, members, gained, significant, scope, to, pursue, their, own, interests, in, 1961, soviet, allied, east, germany, constructed, the, berlin, wall, to, prevent, the, citizens, of, east, berlin, from, fleeing, to, west, berlin, at, the, time, part, of, united, states, allied, west, germany, major, crises, of, this, phase, included, the, berlin, blockade, of, 1948, 1949, the, chinese, communist, revolution, of, 1945, 1949, the, korean, war, of, 1950, 1953, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1956, and, the, suez, crisis, of, that, same, year, the, berlin, crisis, of, 1961, the, cuban, missile, crisis, of, 1962, and, the, vietnam, war, of, 1964, 1975, both, superpowers, competed, for, influence, in, latin, america, and, the, middle, east, and, the, decolonising, states, of, africa, asia, and, oceania, following, the, cuban, missile, crisis, the, fourth, phase, of, the, cold, war, saw, the, sino, soviet, split, between, china, and, the, soviet, union, s, complicated, relations, within, the, communist, sphere, leading, to, the, sino, soviet, border, conflict, while, france, a, western, bloc, state, began, to, demand, greater, autonomy, of, action, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, occurred, to, suppress, the, prague, spring, of, 1968, while, the, united, states, experienced, internal, turmoil, from, the, civil, rights, movement, and, opposition, to, united, states, involvement, in, the, vietnam, war, in, the, 1960s, 1970s, an, international, peace, movement, took, root, among, citizens, around, the, world, movements, against, nuclear, weapons, testing, and, for, nuclear, disarmament, took, place, with, large, anti, war, protests, by, the, 1970s, both, sides, had, started, making, allowances, for, peace, and, security, ushering, in, a, period, of, d, tente, that, saw, the, strategic, arms, limitation, talks, and, the, 1972, visit, by, richard, nixon, to, china, that, opened, relations, with, china, as, a, strategic, counterweight, to, the, soviet, union, a, number, of, self, proclaimed, marxist, leninist, governments, were, formed, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1970s, in, developing, countries, including, angola, mozambique, ethiopia, cambodia, afghanistan, and, nicaragua, d, tente, collapsed, at, the, end, of, the, decade, with, the, beginning, of, the, soviet, afghan, war, in, 1979, beginning, in, the, 1980s, the, fifth, phase, of, the, cold, war, was, another, period, of, elevated, tension, the, reagan, doctrine, led, to, increased, diplomatic, military, and, economic, pressures, on, the, soviet, union, which, at, the, time, was, undergoing, the, era, of, stagnation, the, sixth, phase, of, the, cold, war, saw, the, new, soviet, leader, mikhail, gorbachev, introducing, the, liberalizing, reforms, of, glasnost, openness, and, perestroika, reorganization, and, ending, soviet, involvement, in, afghanistan, in, 1989, pressures, for, national, sovereignty, grew, stronger, in, eastern, europe, and, gorbachev, refused, to, further, support, the, communist, governments, militarily, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, after, the, pan, european, picnic, and, the, revolutions, of, 1989, which, represented, a, peaceful, revolutionary, wave, with, the, exception, of, the, romanian, revolution, and, the, afghan, civil, war, 1989, 1992, overthrew, almost, all, of, the, marxist, leninist, regimes, of, the, eastern, bloc, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, itself, lost, control, in, the, country, and, was, banned, following, the, 1991, soviet, coup, attempt, that, august, this, in, turn, led, to, the, formal, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, december, 1991, and, the, collapse, of, communist, governments, across, much, of, africa, and, asia, the, russian, federation, became, the, soviet, union, s, successor, state, while, many, of, the, other, republics, emerged, from, the, soviet, union, s, collapse, as, fully, independent, post, soviet, states, the, united, states, was, left, as, the, world, s, sole, superpower, the, cold, war, has, left, a, significant, legacy, its, effects, include, references, of, the, culture, during, the, war, particularly, with, themes, of, espionage, and, the, threat, of, nuclear, warfare, the, cold, war, is, generally, followed, by, the, categorization, of, international, relations, since, 1989, and, post, cold, war, era, to, underline, its, impact, the, cold, war, emerged, from, the, breakdown, of, relations, between, two, of, the, primary, victors, of, world, war, ii, the, united, states, and, soviet, union, along, with, their, respective, allies, in, the, western, bloc, and, eastern, bloc, this, ideological, and, political, rivalry, solidified, between, 1945, 49, the, roots, of, the, cold, war, can, be, traced, back, to, diplomatic, and, military, tensions, preceding, world, war, ii, the, 1917, russian, revolution, and, the, subsequent, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, where, soviet, russia, ceded, vast, territories, to, germany, deepened, distrust, among, the, western, allies, allied, intervention, in, the, russian, civil, war, further, complicated, relations, and, although, the, soviet, union, later, allied, with, western, powers, to, defeat, nazi, germany, this, cooperation, was, strained, by, mutual, suspicions, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, disagreements, about, the, future, of, europe, particularly, eastern, europe, became, central, the, soviet, union, s, establishment, of, communist, regimes, in, the, countries, it, had, liberated, from, nazi, control, enforced, by, the, presence, of, the, red, army, alarmed, the, us, and, uk, western, leaders, saw, this, as, a, clear, instance, of, soviet, expansionism, clashing, with, their, vision, of, a, democratic, europe, economically, the, divide, was, sharpened, with, the, introduction, of, the, marshall, plan, in, 1947, a, us, initiative, to, provide, financial, aid, to, rebuild, europe, and, prevent, the, spread, of, communism, by, stabilizing, capitalist, economies, the, soviet, union, rejected, the, marshall, plan, seeing, it, as, an, effort, by, the, us, to, impose, its, influence, on, europe, in, response, the, soviet, union, established, comecon, council, for, mutual, economic, assistance, to, foster, economic, cooperation, among, communist, states, the, first, major, military, confrontation, of, the, cold, war, came, with, the, berlin, blockade, of, 1948, 49, when, the, soviets, attempted, to, cut, off, western, access, to, berlin, the, us, and, its, allies, responded, with, the, berlin, airlift, supplying, west, berlin, by, air, this, marked, a, turning, point, shifting, the, cold, war, from, diplomatic, tensions, to, the, brink, of, direct, military, conflict, further, entrenching, the, division, of, europe, by, 1949, the, cold, war, was, firmly, in, place, the, creation, of, nato, in, 1949, formalized, military, alliances, within, the, western, bloc, signalling, the, start, of, a, long, period, of, geopolitical, confrontation, outside, europe, cold, war, tensions, manifested, differently, particularly, in, southeast, asia, where, the, us, sought, to, counter, soviet, influence, conflicts, such, as, the, korean, war, and, vietnam, war, became, key, battlegrounds, in, the, ideological, struggle, between, capitalism, and, communism, in, late, february, 1946, george, f, kennan, s, long, telegram, from, moscow, to, washington, helped, to, articulate, the, us, government, s, increasingly, hard, line, against, the, soviets, which, would, become, the, basis, for, us, strategy, toward, the, soviet, union, for, the, duration, of, the, cold, war, the, telegram, galvanized, a, policy, debate, that, would, eventually, shape, the, truman, administration, s, soviet, policy, washington, s, opposition, to, the, soviets, accumulated, after, broken, promises, by, stalin, and, molotov, concerning, europe, and, iran, following, the, world, war, ii, anglo, soviet, invasion, of, iran, the, country, was, occupied, by, the, red, army, in, the, far, north, and, the, british, in, the, south, iran, was, used, by, the, united, states, and, british, to, supply, the, soviet, union, and, the, allies, agreed, to, withdraw, from, iran, within, six, months, after, the, cessation, of, hostilities, however, when, this, deadline, came, the, soviets, remained, in, iran, under, the, guise, of, the, azerbaijan, people, s, government, and, kurdish, republic, of, mahabad, shortly, thereafter, on, 5, march, former, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, delivered, his, famous, iron, curtain, speech, in, fulton, missouri, the, speech, called, for, an, anglo, american, alliance, against, the, soviets, whom, he, accused, of, establishing, an, iron, curtain, dividing, europe, from, stettin, in, the, baltic, to, trieste, in, the, adriatic, a, week, later, on, 13, march, stalin, responded, vigorously, to, the, speech, saying, that, churchill, could, be, compared, to, adolf, hitler, insofar, as, he, advocated, the, racial, superiority, of, english, speaking, nations, so, that, they, could, satisfy, their, hunger, for, world, domination, and, that, such, a, declaration, was, a, call, for, war, on, the, ussr, the, soviet, leader, also, dismissed, the, accusation, that, the, ussr, was, exerting, increasing, control, over, the, countries, lying, in, its, sphere, he, argued, that, there, was, nothing, surprising, in, the, fact, that, the, soviet, union, anxious, for, its, future, safety, trying, to, see, to, it, that, governments, loyal, in, their, attitude, to, the, soviet, union, should, exist, in, these, countries, soviet, territorial, demands, to, turkey, regarding, the, dardanelles, in, the, turkish, straits, crisis, and, black, sea, border, disputes, were, also, a, major, factor, in, increasing, tensions, in, september, the, soviet, side, produced, the, novikov, telegram, sent, by, the, soviet, ambassador, to, the, us, but, commissioned, and, co, authored, by, vyacheslav, molotov, it, portrayed, the, us, as, being, in, the, grip, of, monopoly, capitalists, who, were, building, up, military, capability, to, prepare, the, conditions, for, winning, world, supremacy, in, a, new, war, on, 6, september, 1946, james, f, byrnes, delivered, a, speech, in, germany, repudiating, the, morgenthau, plan, a, proposal, to, partition, and, de, industrialize, post, war, germany, and, warning, the, soviets, that, the, us, intended, to, maintain, a, military, presence, in, europe, indefinitely, as, byrnes, stated, a, month, later, the, nub, of, our, program, was, to, win, the, german, people, it, was, a, battle, between, us, and, russia, over, minds, in, december, the, soviets, agreed, to, withdraw, from, iran, after, persistent, us, pressure, an, early, success, of, containment, policy, by, 1947, us, president, harry, s, truman, was, outraged, by, the, perceived, resistance, of, the, soviet, union, to, american, demands, in, iran, turkey, and, greece, as, well, as, soviet, rejection, of, the, baruch, plan, on, nuclear, weapons, in, february, 1947, the, british, government, announced, that, it, could, no, longer, afford, to, finance, the, kingdom, of, greece, in, its, civil, war, against, communist, led, insurgents, in, the, same, month, stalin, conducted, the, rigged, 1947, polish, legislative, election, which, constituted, an, open, breach, of, the, yalta, agreement, the, us, government, responded, to, this, announcement, by, adopting, a, policy, of, containment, with, the, goal, of, stopping, the, spread, of, communism, truman, delivered, a, speech, calling, for, the, allocation, of, 400, million, to, intervene, in, the, war, and, unveiled, the, truman, doctrine, which, framed, the, conflict, as, a, contest, between, free, peoples, and, totalitarian, regimes, american, policymakers, accused, the, soviet, union, of, conspiring, against, the, greek, royalists, in, an, effort, to, expand, soviet, influence, even, though, stalin, had, told, the, communist, party, to, cooperate, with, the, british, backed, government, the, insurgents, were, helped, by, josip, broz, tito, s, socialist, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, against, stalin, s, wishes, enunciation, of, the, truman, doctrine, marked, the, beginning, of, a, us, bipartisan, defense, and, foreign, policy, consensus, between, republicans, and, democrats, focused, on, containment, and, deterrence, that, weakened, during, and, after, the, vietnam, war, but, ultimately, persisted, thereafter, moderate, and, conservative, parties, in, europe, as, well, as, social, democrats, gave, virtually, unconditional, support, to, the, western, alliance, while, european, and, american, communists, financed, by, the, kgb, and, involved, in, its, intelligence, operations, adhered, to, moscow, s, line, although, dissent, began, to, appear, after, 1956, other, critiques, of, the, consensus, policy, came, from, anti, vietnam, war, activists, the, campaign, for, nuclear, disarmament, and, the, anti, nuclear, movement, in, early, 1947, france, britain, and, the, united, states, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, reach, an, agreement, with, the, soviet, union, for, a, plan, envisioning, an, economically, self, sufficient, germany, including, a, detailed, accounting, of, the, industrial, plants, goods, and, infrastructure, already, taken, by, the, soviets, in, june, 1947, in, accordance, with, the, truman, doctrine, the, united, states, enacted, the, marshall, plan, a, pledge, of, economic, assistance, for, all, european, countries, willing, to, participate, including, the, soviet, union, under, the, plan, which, president, harry, s, truman, signed, on, 3, april, 1948, the, us, government, gave, to, western, european, countries, over, 13, billion, equivalent, to, 189, 39, billion, in, 2016, to, rebuild, the, economy, of, europe, later, the, program, led, to, the, creation, of, the, oecd, the, plan, s, aim, was, to, rebuild, the, democratic, and, economic, systems, of, europe, and, to, counter, perceived, threats, to, the, european, balance, of, power, such, as, communist, parties, seizing, control, through, revolutions, or, elections, the, plan, also, stated, that, european, prosperity, was, contingent, upon, german, economic, recovery, one, month, later, truman, signed, the, national, security, act, of, 1947, creating, a, unified, department, of, defense, the, central, intelligence, agency, cia, and, the, national, security, council, nsc, these, would, become, the, main, bureaucracies, for, us, defense, policy, in, the, cold, war, stalin, believed, that, economic, integration, with, the, west, would, allow, eastern, bloc, countries, to, escape, soviet, control, and, that, the, us, was, trying, to, buy, a, pro, us, re, alignment, of, europe, stalin, therefore, prevented, eastern, bloc, nations, from, receiving, marshall, plan, aid, the, soviet, union, s, alternative, to, the, marshall, plan, which, was, purported, to, involve, soviet, subsidies, and, trade, with, central, and, eastern, europe, became, known, as, the, molotov, plan, later, institutionalized, in, january, 1949, as, the, council, for, mutual, economic, assistance, stalin, was, also, fearful, of, a, reconstituted, germany, his, vision, of, a, post, war, germany, did, not, include, the, ability, to, rearm, or, pose, any, kind, of, threat, to, the, soviet, union, in, early, 1948, following, reports, of, strengthening, reactionary, elements, czech, communists, executed, a, coup, d, tat, in, czechoslovakia, resulting, in, the, formation, of, the, czechoslovak, socialist, republic, 9, may, 1948, the, only, eastern, bloc, state, that, the, soviets, had, permitted, to, retain, democratic, structures, the, public, brutality, of, the, coup, shocked, western, powers, more, than, any, event, up, to, that, point, set, in, motion, a, brief, scare, that, war, would, occur, and, swept, away, the, last, vestiges, of, opposition, to, the, marshall, plan, in, the, united, states, congress, in, an, immediate, aftermath, of, the, crisis, the, london, six, power, conference, was, held, resulting, in, the, soviet, boycott, of, the, allied, control, council, and, its, incapacitation, an, event, marking, the, beginning, of, the, full, blown, cold, war, and, the, end, of, its, prelude, as, well, as, ending, any, hopes, at, the, time, for, a, single, german, government, and, leading, to, formation, in, 1949, of, the, federal, republic, of, germany, and, german, democratic, republic, the, twin, policies, of, the, truman, doctrine, and, the, marshall, plan, led, to, billions, in, economic, and, military, aid, for, western, europe, greece, and, turkey, with, the, us, assistance, the, greek, military, won, its, civil, war, under, the, leadership, of, alcide, de, gasperi, the, italian, christian, democrats, defeated, the, powerful, communist, socialist, alliance, in, the, elections, of, 1948, all, major, powers, engaged, in, espionage, using, a, great, variety, of, spies, double, agents, moles, and, new, technologies, such, as, the, tapping, of, telephone, cables, the, soviet, kgb, committee, for, state, security, the, bureau, responsible, for, foreign, espionage, and, internal, surveillance, was, famous, for, its, effectiveness, the, most, famous, soviet, operation, involved, its, atomic, spies, that, delivered, crucial, information, from, the, united, states, manhattan, project, leading, the, ussr, to, detonate, its, first, nuclear, weapon, in, 1949, four, years, after, the, american, detonation, and, much, sooner, than, expected, a, massive, network, of, informants, throughout, the, soviet, union, was, used, to, monitor, dissent, from, official, soviet, politics, and, morals, although, to, an, extent, disinformation, had, always, existed, the, term, itself, was, invented, and, the, strategy, formalized, by, a, black, propaganda, department, of, the, soviet, kgb, based, on, the, amount, of, top, secret, cold, war, archival, information, that, has, been, released, historian, raymond, l, garthoff, concludes, there, probably, was, parity, in, the, quantity, and, quality, of, secret, information, obtained, by, each, side, however, the, soviets, probably, had, an, advantage, in, terms, of, humint, human, intelligence, or, interpersonal, espionage, and, sometimes, in, its, reach, into, high, policy, circles, in, terms, of, decisive, impact, however, he, concludes, according, to, historian, robert, l, benson, washington, s, forte, was, signals, intelligence, the, procurement, and, analysis, of, coded, foreign, messages, leading, to, the, venona, project, or, venona, intercepts, which, monitored, the, communications, of, soviet, intelligence, agents, moynihan, wrote, that, the, venona, project, contained, overwhelming, proof, of, the, activities, of, soviet, spy, networks, in, america, complete, with, names, dates, places, and, deeds, the, venona, project, was, kept, highly, secret, even, from, policymakers, until, the, moynihan, commission, in, 1995, despite, this, the, decryption, project, had, already, been, betrayed, and, dispatched, to, the, ussr, by, kim, philby, and, bill, weisband, in, 1946, as, was, discovered, by, the, us, by, 1950, nonetheless, the, soviets, had, to, keep, their, discovery, of, the, program, secret, too, and, continued, leaking, their, own, information, some, of, which, was, still, useful, to, the, american, program, according, to, moynihan, even, president, truman, may, not, have, been, fully, informed, of, venona, which, may, have, left, him, unaware, of, the, extent, of, soviet, espionage, clandestine, atomic, spies, from, the, soviet, union, who, infiltrated, the, manhattan, project, at, various, points, during, wwii, played, a, major, role, in, increasing, tensions, that, led, to, the, cold, war, in, addition, to, usual, espionage, the, western, agencies, paid, special, attention, to, debriefing, eastern, bloc, defectors, edward, jay, epstein, describes, that, the, cia, understood, that, the, kgb, used, provocations, or, fake, defections, as, a, trick, to, embarrass, western, intelligence, and, establish, soviet, double, agents, as, a, result, from, 1959, to,

home, radio, station, an, alternative, to, the, controlled, and, party, dominated, domestic, press, in, the, soviet, bloc, radio, free, europe, was, a, product, of, some, of, the, most, prominent, architects, of, america, s, early, cold, war, strategy, especially, those, who, believed, that, the, cold, war, would, eventually, be, fought, by, political, rather, than, military, means, such, as, george, f, kennan, soviet, and, eastern, bloc, authorities, used, various, methods, to, suppress, western, broadcasts, including, radio, jamming, american, policymakers, including, kennan, and, john, foster, dulles, acknowledged, that, the, cold, war, was, in, its, essence, a, war, of, ideas, the, united, states, acting, through, the, cia, funded, a, long, list, of, projects, to, counter, the, communist, appeal, among, intellectuals, in, europe, and, the, developing, world, the, cia, also, covertly, sponsored, a, domestic, propaganda, campaign, called, crusade, for, freedom, the, rearmament, of, west, germany, was, achieved, in, the, early, 1950s, its, main, promoter, was, konrad, adenauer, the, chancellor, of, west, germany, with, france, the, main, opponent, washington, had, the, decisive, voice, it, was, strongly, supported, by, the, pentagon, the, us, military, leadership, and, weakly, opposed, by, president, truman, the, state, department, was, ambivalent, the, outbreak, of, the, korean, war, in, june, 1950, changed, the, calculations, and, washington, now, gave, full, support, that, also, involved, naming, dwight, d, eisenhower, in, charge, of, nato, forces, and, sending, more, american, troops, to, west, germany, there, was, a, strong, promise, that, west, germany, would, not, develop, nuclear, weapons, widespread, fears, of, another, rise, of, german, militarism, necessitated, the, new, military, to, operate, within, an, alliance, framework, under, nato, command, in, 1955, washington, secured, full, german, membership, of, nato, in, may, 1953, lavrentiy, beria, by, then, in, a, government, post, had, made, an, unsuccessful, proposal, to, allow, the, reunification, of, a, neutral, germany, to, prevent, west, germany, s, incorporation, into, nato, but, his, attempts, were, cut, short, after, he, was, executed, several, months, later, during, a, soviet, power, struggle, the, events, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, bundeswehr, the, west, german, military, in, 1955, in, 1949, mao, zedong, s, people, s, liberation, army, defeated, chiang, kai, shek, s, united, states, backed, kuomintang, kmt, nationalist, government, in, china, the, kmt, controlled, territory, was, now, restricted, to, the, island, of, taiwan, the, nationalist, government, of, which, exists, to, this, day, the, kremlin, promptly, created, an, alliance, with, the, newly, formed, people, s, republic, of, china, according, to, norwegian, historian, odd, arne, westad, the, communists, won, the, civil, war, because, they, made, fewer, military, mistakes, than, chiang, kai, shek, made, and, because, in, his, search, for, a, powerful, centralized, government, chiang, antagonized, too, many, interest, groups, in, china, moreover, his, party, was, weakened, during, the, war, against, japan, meanwhile, the, communists, told, different, groups, such, as, the, peasants, exactly, what, they, wanted, to, hear, and, they, cloaked, themselves, under, the, cover, of, chinese, nationalism, confronted, with, the, communist, revolution, in, china, and, the, end, of, the, american, atomic, monopoly, in, 1949, the, truman, administration, quickly, moved, to, escalate, and, expand, its, containment, doctrine, in, nsc, 68, a, secret, 1950, document, the, national, security, council, proposed, reinforcing, pro, western, alliance, systems, and, quadrupling, spending, on, defense, truman, under, the, influence, of, advisor, paul, nitze, saw, containment, as, implying, complete, rollback, of, soviet, influence, in, all, its, forms, united, states, officials, moved, to, expand, this, version, of, containment, into, asia, africa, and, latin, america, in, order, to, counter, revolutionary, nationalist, movements, often, led, by, communist, parties, financed, by, the, ussr, in, this, way, this, us, would, exercise, preponderant, power, oppose, neutrality, and, establish, global, hegemony, in, the, early, 1950s, a, period, sometimes, known, as, the, pactomania, the, us, formalized, a, series, of, alliances, with, japan, a, former, wwii, enemy, south, korea, taiwan, australia, new, zealand, thailand, and, the, philippines, notably, anzus, in, 1951, and, seato, in, 1954, thereby, guaranteeing, the, united, states, a, number, of, long, term, military, bases, one, of, the, more, significant, examples, of, the, implementation, of, containment, was, the, united, nations, us, led, intervention, in, the, korean, war, in, june, 1950, after, years, of, mutual, hostilities, kim, il, sung, s, north, korean, people, s, army, invaded, south, korea, at, the, 38th, parallel, stalin, had, been, reluctant, to, support, the, invasion, but, ultimately, sent, advisers, to, stalin, s, surprise, the, united, nations, security, council, resolution, 82, and, 83, backed, the, defense, of, south, korea, although, the, soviets, were, then, boycotting, meetings, in, protest, of, the, fact, that, taiwan, republic, of, china, not, the, people, s, republic, of, china, held, a, permanent, seat, on, the, council, a, un, force, of, sixteen, countries, faced, north, korea, although, 40, percent, of, troops, were, south, korean, and, about, 50, percent, were, from, the, united, states, the, us, initially, seemed, to, follow, containment, when, it, first, entered, the, war, this, directed, the, us, s, action, to, only, push, back, north, korea, across, the, 38th, parallel, and, restore, south, korea, s, sovereignty, while, allowing, north, korea, s, survival, as, a, state, however, the, success, of, the, inchon, landing, inspired, the, us, un, forces, to, pursue, a, rollback, strategy, instead, and, to, overthrow, communist, north, korea, thereby, allowing, nationwide, elections, under, u, n, auspices, general, douglas, macarthur, then, advanced, across, the, 38th, parallel, into, north, korea, the, chinese, fearful, of, a, possible, us, invasion, sent, in, a, large, army, and, defeated, the, u, n, forces, pushing, them, back, below, the, 38th, parallel, truman, publicly, hinted, that, he, might, use, his, ace, in, the, hole, of, the, atomic, bomb, but, mao, was, unmoved, the, episode, was, used, to, support, the, wisdom, of, the, containment, doctrine, as, opposed, to, rollback, the, communists, were, later, pushed, to, roughly, around, the, original, border, with, minimal, changes, among, other, effects, the, korean, war, galvanised, nato, to, develop, a, military, structure, public, opinion, in, countries, involved, such, as, great, britain, was, divided, for, and, against, the, war, after, the, korean, armistice, agreement, was, approved, in, july, 1953, north, korean, leader, kim, il, sung, created, a, highly, centralized, totalitarian, dictatorship, that, accorded, his, family, unlimited, power, while, generating, a, pervasive, cult, of, personality, in, the, south, the, american, backed, dictator, syngman, rhee, ran, an, authoritarian, regime, that, engaged, in, anti, communist, mass, killings, while, rhee, was, overthrown, in, 1960, south, korea, continued, to, be, ruled, by, a, military, government, of, former, japanese, collaborators, until, the, re, establishment, of, a, multi, party, system, in, the, late, 1980s, subsequently, south, korea, experienced, an, economic, boom, and, became, one, of, the, most, advanced, countries, on, the, planet, in, 1953, changes, in, political, leadership, on, both, sides, shifted, the, dynamic, of, the, cold, war, dwight, d, eisenhower, was, inaugurated, president, that, january, during, the, last, 18, months, of, the, truman, administration, the, american, defense, budget, had, quadrupled, and, eisenhower, moved, to, reduce, military, spending, by, a, third, while, continuing, to, fight, the, cold, war, effectively, joseph, stalin, died, in, 1953, without, a, mutually, agreeable, successor, the, highest, communist, party, officials, initially, opted, to, rule, the, soviet, union, jointly, through, a, troika, headed, by, georgy, malenkov, this, did, not, last, however, and, nikita, khrushchev, eventually, won, the, ensuing, power, struggle, by, the, mid, 1950s, in, 1956, he, denounced, joseph, stalin, and, proceeded, to, ease, controls, over, the, party, and, society, this, was, known, as, de, stalinization, on, 18, november, 1956, while, addressing, western, dignitaries, at, a, reception, in, moscow, s, polish, embassy, khrushchev, infamously, declared, whether, you, like, it, or, not, history, is, on, our, side, we, will, bury, you, shocking, everyone, present, he, would, later, claim, he, had, not, been, referring, to, nuclear, war, but, the, historically, fated, victory, of, communism, over, capitalism, in, 1961, khrushchev, boasted, that, even, if, the, soviet, union, was, currently, behind, the, west, its, housing, shortage, would, disappear, within, ten, years, consumer, goods, would, be, made, abundant, and, the, construction, of, a, communist, society, would, be, completed, in, the, main, within, no, more, than, two, decades, eisenhower, s, secretary, of, state, john, foster, dulles, initiated, a, new, look, for, the, containment, strategy, calling, for, a, greater, reliance, on, nuclear, weapons, against, us, enemies, in, wartime, dulles, also, enunciated, the, doctrine, of, massive, retaliation, threatening, a, severe, us, response, to, any, soviet, aggression, possessing, nuclear, superiority, for, example, allowed, eisenhower, to, face, down, soviet, threats, to, intervene, in, the, middle, east, during, the, 1956, suez, crisis, the, declassified, us, plans, for, retaliatory, nuclear, strikes, in, the, late, 1950s, included, the, systematic, destruction, of, 1, 200, major, urban, centers, in, the, soviet, bloc, and, china, including, moscow, east, berlin, and, beijing, in, spite, of, these, events, there, were, substantial, hopes, for, d, tente, when, an, upswing, in, diplomacy, took, place, in, 1959, including, a, two, week, visit, by, khrushchev, to, the, us, and, plans, for, a, two, power, summit, for, may, 1960, the, latter, was, disturbed, by, the, u, 2, spy, plane, scandal, however, in, which, eisenhower, was, caught, lying, about, the, intrusion, of, american, surveillance, aircraft, into, soviet, territory, while, stalin, s, death, in, 1953, slightly, relaxed, tensions, the, situation, in, europe, remained, an, uneasy, armed, truce, the, soviets, who, had, already, created, a, network, of, mutual, assistance, treaties, in, the, eastern, bloc, by, 1949, established, a, formal, alliance, therein, the, warsaw, pact, in, 1955, it, stood, opposed, to, nato, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1956, occurred, shortly, after, khrushchev, arranged, the, removal, of, hungary, s, stalinist, leader, m, ty, s, r, kosi, in, response, to, a, popular, anti, communist, uprising, the, new, regime, formally, disbanded, the, secret, police, declared, its, intention, to, withdraw, from, the, warsaw, pact, and, pledged, to, re, establish, free, elections, the, soviet, army, invaded, thousands, of, hungarians, were, killed, and, arrested, imprisoned, and, deported, to, the, soviet, union, and, approximately, 200, 000, hungarians, fled, hungary, in, the, chaos, hungarian, leader, imre, nagy, and, others, were, executed, following, secret, trials, from, 1957, through, 1961, khrushchev, openly, and, repeatedly, threatened, the, west, with, nuclear, annihilation, he, claimed, that, soviet, missile, capabilities, were, far, superior, to, those, of, the, united, states, capable, of, wiping, out, any, american, or, european, city, according, to, john, lewis, gaddis, khrushchev, rejected, stalin, s, belief, in, the, inevitability, of, war, however, the, new, leader, declared, his, ultimate, goal, was, peaceful, coexistence, in, khrushchev, s, formulation, peace, would, allow, capitalism, to, collapse, on, its, own, as, well, as, giving, the, soviets, time, to, boost, their, military, capabilities, which, remained, for, decades, until, gorbachev, s, later, new, thinking, envisioning, peaceful, coexistence, as, an, end, in, itself, rather, than, a, form, of, class, struggle, the, events, in, hungary, produced, ideological, fractures, within, the, communist, parties, of, the, world, particularly, in, western, europe, with, great, decline, in, membership, as, many, in, both, western, and, socialist, countries, felt, disillusioned, by, the, brutal, soviet, response, the, communist, parties, in, the, west, would, never, recover, from, the, effect, the, hungarian, revolution, had, on, their, membership, a, fact, that, was, immediately, recognized, by, some, such, as, the, yugoslavian, politician, milovan, ilas, who, shortly, after, the, revolution, was, crushed, said, that, the, wound, which, the, hungarian, revolution, inflicted, on, communism, can, never, be, completely, healed, in, 1957, polish, foreign, minister, adam, rapacki, proposed, the, rapacki, plan, for, a, nuclear, free, zone, in, central, europe, public, opinion, tended, to, be, favourable, in, the, west, but, it, was, rejected, by, leaders, of, west, germany, britain, france, and, the, united, states, they, feared, it, would, leave, the, powerful, conventional, armies, of, the, warsaw, pact, dominant, over, the, weaker, nato, armies, during, november, 1958, khrushchev, made, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, turn, all, of, berlin, into, an, independent, demilitarized, free, city, he, gave, the, united, states, great, britain, and, france, a, six, month, ultimatum, to, withdraw, their, troops, from, the, sectors, of, west, berlin, or, he, would, transfer, control, of, western, access, rights, to, the, east, germans, khrushchev, earlier, explained, to, mao, zedong, that, berlin, is, the, testicles, of, the, west, every, time, i, want, to, make, the, west, scream, i, squeeze, on, berlin, nato, formally, rejected, the, ultimatum, in, mid, december, and, khrushchev, withdrew, it, in, return, for, a, geneva, conference, on, the, german, question, john, f, kennedy, s, foreign, policy, was, dominated, by, american, confrontations, with, the, soviet, union, manifested, by, proxy, contests, like, truman, and, eisenhower, kennedy, supported, containment, to, stop, the, spread, of, communism, president, eisenhower, s, new, look, policy, had, emphasized, the, use, of, less, expensive, nuclear, weapons, to, deter, soviet, aggression, by, threatening, massive, nuclear, attacks, on, all, of, the, soviet, union, nuclear, weapons, were, much, cheaper, than, maintaining, a, large, standing, army, so, eisenhower, cut, conventional, forces, to, save, money, kennedy, implemented, a, new, strategy, known, as, flexible, response, this, strategy, relied, on, conventional, arms, to, achieve, limited, goals, as, part, of, this, policy, kennedy, expanded, the, united, states, special, operations, forces, elite, military, units, that, could, fight, unconventionally, in, various, conflicts, kennedy, hoped, that, the, flexible, response, strategy, would, allow, the, us, to, counter, soviet, influence, without, resorting, to, nuclear, war, to, support, his, new, strategy, kennedy, ordered, a, massive, increase, in, defense, spending, he, sought, and, congress, provided, a, rapid, build, up, of, the, nuclear, arsenal, to, restore, the, lost, superiority, over, the, soviet, union, he, claimed, in, 1960, that, eisenhower, had, lost, it, because, of, excessive, concern, with, budget, deficits, in, his, inaugural, address, kennedy, promised, to, bear, any, burden, in, the, defense, of, liberty, and, he, repeatedly, asked, for, increases, in, military, spending, and, authorization, of, new, weapons, systems, from, 1961, to, 1964, the, number, of, nuclear, weapons, increased, by, 50, percent, as, did, the, number, of, b, 52, bombers, to, deliver, them, the, new, icbm, force, grew, from, 63, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, to, 424, he, authorized, 23, new, polaris, submarines, each, of, which, carried, 16, nuclear, missiles, kennedy, also, called, on, cities, to, construct, fallout, shelters, nationalist, movements, in, some, countries, and, regions, notably, guatemala, indonesia, and, indochina, were, often, allied, with, communist, groups, or, otherwise, perceived, to, be, unfriendly, to, western, interests, in, this, context, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, increasingly, competed, for, influence, by, proxy, in, the, third, world, as, decolonization, gained, momentum, in, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, both, sides, were, selling, armaments, to, gain, influence, the, kremlin, saw, continuing, territorial, losses, by, imperial, powers, as, presaging, the, eventual, victory,

post, world, war, ii, germany, by, the, early, 1950s, the, soviet, approach, to, restricting, emigration, movement, was, emulated, by, most, of, the, rest, of, the, eastern, bloc, however, hundreds, of, thousands, of, east, germans, annually, emigrated, to, free, and, prosperous, west, germany, through, a, loophole, in, the, system, that, existed, between, east, berlin, and, west, berlin, the, emigration, resulted, in, a, massive, brain, drain, from, east, germany, to, west, germany, of, younger, educated, professionals, such, that, nearly, 20, of, east, germany, s, population, had, migrated, to, west, germany, by, 1961, that, june, the, soviet, union, issued, a, new, ultimatum, demanding, the, withdrawal, of, allied, forces, from, west, berlin, the, request, was, rebuffed, but, the, united, states, now, limited, its, security, guarantees, to, west, berlin, on, 13, august, east, germany, erected, a, barbed, wire, barrier, that, would, eventually, be, expanded, through,

of, the, project, in, february, 1962, and, preparations, to, install, soviet, nuclear, missiles, in, cuba, were, undertaken, in, response, alarmed, kennedy, considered, various, reactions, he, ultimately, responded, to, the, installation, of, nuclear, missiles, in, cuba, with, a, naval, blockade, and, he, presented, an, ultimatum, to, the, soviets, khrushchev, backed, down, from, a, confrontation, and, the, soviet, union, removed, the, missiles, in, return, for, a, public, american, pledge, not, to, invade, cuba, again, as, well, as, a, covert, deal, to, remove, us, missiles, from, turkey, castro, later, admitted, that, i, would, have, agreed, to, the, use, of, nuclear, weapons, we, took, it, for, granted, that, it, would, become, a, nuclear, war, anyway, and, that, we, were, going, to, disappear, the, cuban, missile, crisis, october, november, 1962, brought, the, world, closer, to, nuclear, war, than, ever, before, the, aftermath, led, to, efforts, in, the, nuclear, arms, race, at, nuclear, disarmament, and, improving, relations, although, the, cold, war, s, first, arms, control, agreement, the, antarctic, treaty, had, come, into, force, in, 1961, the, compromise, embarrassed, khrushchev, and, the, soviet, union, because, the, withdrawal, of, us, missiles, from, italy, and, turkey, was, a, secret, deal, between, kennedy, and, khrushchev, and, the, soviets, were, seen, as, retreating, from, circumstances, that, they, had, started, in, 1964, khrushchev, s, kremlin, colleagues, managed, to, oust, him, but, allowed, him, a, peaceful, retirement, he, was, accused, of, rudeness, and, incompetence, and, john, lewis, gaddis, argues, that, he, was, also, blamed, with, ruining, soviet, agriculture, bringing, the, world, to, the, brink, of, nuclear, war, and, becoming, an, international, embarrassment, when, he, authorized, construction, of, the, berlin, wall, according, to, dobrynin, the, top, soviet, leadership, took, the, cuban, outcome, as, a, blow, to, its, prestige, bordering, on, humiliation, in, the, course, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, cold, war, participants, struggled, to, adjust, to, a, new, more, complicated, pattern, of, international, relations, in, which, the, world, was, no, longer, divided, into, two, clearly, opposed, blocs, from, the, beginning, of, the, post, war, period, with, american, help, western, europe, and, japan, rapidly, recovered, from, the, destruction, of, world, war, ii, and, sustained, strong, economic, growth, through, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, with, per, capita, gdps, approaching, those, of, the, united, states, while, eastern, bloc, economies, stagnated, the, vietnam, war, descended, into, a, quagmire, for, the, united, states, leading, to, a, decline, in, international, prestige, and, economic, stability, derailing, arms, agreements, and, provoking, domestic, unrest, america, s, withdrawal, from, the, war, led, it, to, embrace, a, policy, of, d, tente, with, both, china, and, the, soviet, union, in, the, 1973, oil, crisis, organization, of, petroleum, exporting, countries, opec, cut, their, petroleum, output, this, raised, oil, prices, and, hurt, western, economies, but, helped, the, soviet, union, by, generating, a, huge, flow, of, money, from, its, oil, sales, as, a, result, of, the, oil, crisis, combined, with, the, growing, influence, of, third, world, alignments, such, as, opec, and, the, non, aligned, movement, less, powerful, countries, had, more, room, to, assert, their, independence, and, often, showed, themselves, resistant, to, pressure, from, either, superpower, meanwhile, moscow, was, forced, to, turn, its, attention, inward, to, deal, with, the, soviet, union, s, deep, seated, domestic, economic, problems, during, this, period, soviet, leaders,

presence, deploying, ground, combat, units, for, the, first, time, and, increasing, troop, levels, to, 184, 000, soviet, leader, leonid, brezhnev, responded, by, reversing, khrushchev, s, policy, of, disengagement, and, increasing, aid, to, the, north, vietnamese, hoping, to, entice, the, north, from, its, pro, chinese, position, the, ussr, discouraged, further, escalation, of, the, war, however, providing, just, enough, military, assistance, to, tie, up, american, forces, from, this, point, the, people, s, army, of, vietnam, pavn, also, known, as, the, north, vietnamese, army, nva, engaged, in, more, conventional, warfare, with, us, and, south, vietnamese, forces, the, tet, offensive, of, 1968, proved, to, be, the, turning, point, of, the, war, despite, years, of, american, tutelage, and, aid, the, south, vietnamese, forces, were, unable, to, withstand, the, communist, offensive, and, the, task, fell, to, us, forces, instead, tet, showed, that, the, end, of, us, involvement, was, not, in, sight, increasing, domestic, skepticism, of, the, war, and, giving, rise, to, what, was, referred, to, as, the, vietnam, syndrome, a, public, aversion, to, american, overseas, military, involvements, nonetheless, operations, continued, to, cross, international, boundaries, bordering, areas, of, laos, and, cambodia, were, used, by, north, vietnam, as, supply, routes, and, were,

was, breached, early, in, its, history, with, a, crisis, occurring, during, charles, de, gaulle, s, presidency, of, france, de, gaulle, protested, at, the, strong, role, of, the, united, states, in, the, organization, and, what, he, perceived, as, a, special, relationship, between, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, in, a, memorandum, sent, to, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, and, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, on, 17, september, 1958, he, argued, for, the, creation, of, a, tripartite, directorate, that, would, put, france, on, an, equal, footing, with, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, and, also, for, the, expansion, of, nato, s, coverage, to, include, geographical, areas, of, interest, to, france, most, notably, french, algeria, where, france, was, waging, a, counter, insurgency, and, sought, nato, assistance, de, gaulle, considered, the, response, he, received, to, be, unsatisfactory, and, began, the, development, of, an, independent, french, nuclear, deterrent, in, 1966, he, withdrew, france, from, nato, s, military, structures, and, expelled, nato, troops, from, french, soil, officially, claiming, to, be, neutral, finland, lay, in, the, grey, zone, between, the, western, countries, and, the, soviet, union, the, yya, treaty, finno, soviet, pact, of, friendship, cooperation, and, mutual, assistance, gave, the, soviet, union, some, leverage, in, finnish, domestic, politics, which, was, later, used, as, the, term, finlandization, by, the, west, german, press, meaning, to, become, like, finland, this, meant, among, other, things, the, soviet, adaptation, spread, to, the, editors, of, mass, media, sparking, strong, forms, of, self, control, self, censorship, which, included, the, banning, of, anti, soviet, books, and, pro, soviet, attitudes, most, of, the, elite, of, media, and, politics, shifted, their, attitudes, to, match, the, values, that, the, soviets, were, thought, to, favor, and, approve, only, after, the, ascent, of, mikhail, gorbachev, to, soviet, leadership, in, 1985, did, mass, media, in, finland, gradually, begin, to, criticise, the, soviet, union, more, when, the, soviet, union, allowed, non, communist, governments, to, take, power, in, eastern, europe, gorbachev, suggested, they, could, look, to, finland, as, an, example, to, follow, for, west, german, conservative, politicians, especially, the, bavarian, prime, minister, franz, josef, strauss, the, case, of, finlandization, served, as, a, warning, for, example, about, how, a, great, power, dictates, its, much, smaller, neighbor, in, its, internal, affairs, and, the, neighbor, s, independence, becomes, formal, during, the, cold, war, finlandization, was, seen, not, only, in, bavaria, but, also, in, western, intelligence, services, as, a, threat, that, completely, free, states, had, to, be, warned, about, in, advance, to, combat, finlandization, propaganda, books, and, newspaper, articles, were, published, through, cia, funded, research, institutes, and, media, companies, which, denigrated, finnish, neutrality, policy, and, its, pro, soviet, president, urho, kekkonen, this, was, one, factor, in, making, room, for, the, east, west, espionage, on, finnish, soil, between, the, two, great, powers, however, finland, maintained, capitalism, unlike, most, other, countries, bordering, the, soviet, union, even, though, being, a, neighbor, to, the, soviet, union, sometimes, resulted, in, overcautious, concern, in, foreign, policy, finland, developed, closer, co, operation, with, the, other, nordic, countries, and, declared, itself, even, more, neutral, in, superpower, politics, although, in, the, later, years, support, for, capitalism, was, even, more, widespread, in, 1968, a, period, of, political, liberalization, took, place, in, czechoslovakia, called, the, prague, spring, an, action, program, of, reforms, included, increasing, freedom, of, the, press, freedom, of,

000, the, invasion, sparked, intense, protests, from, yugoslavia, romania, china, and, from, western, european, countries, in, september, 1968, during, a, speech, at, the, fifth, congress, of, the, polish, united, workers, party, one, month, after, the, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, brezhnev, outlined, the, brezhnev, doctrine, in, which, he, claimed, the, right, to, violate, the, sovereignty, of, any, country, attempting, to, replace, marxism, leninism, with, capitalism, during, the, speech, brezhnev, stated, when, forces, that, are, hostile, to, socialism, try, to, turn, the, development, of, some, socialist, country, towards, capitalism, it, becomes, not, only, a, problem, of, the, country, concerned, but, a, common, problem, and, concern, of, all, socialist, countries, the, doctrine, found, its, origins, in, the, failures, of, marxism, leninism, in, states, like, poland, hungary, and, east, germany, which, were, facing, a, declining, standard, of, living, contrasting, with, the, prosperity, of, west, germany, and, the, rest, of, western, europe, under, the, lyndon, b, johnson, administration, the, us, took, a, more, hardline, stance, on, latin, america, sometimes, called,

fled, to, china, with, the, establishment, of, the, grunk, in, beijing, american, and, south, vietnamese, forces, responded, to, these, actions, with, a, bombing, campaign, and, a, ground, incursion, which, contributed, to, the, violence, of, the, civil, war, that, soon, enveloped, all, of, cambodia, us, carpet, bombing, lasted, until, 1973, and, while, it, prevented, the, khmer, rouge, from,

war, communist, adversary, the, soviet, union, was, unable, to, protect, its, vietnamese, ally, former, u, s, secretary, of, state, henry, kissinger, wrote, that, china, succeeded, in, exposing, the, limits, of, strategic, reach, and, speculated, that, the, desire, to, compensate, for, their, ineffectuality, contributed, to, the, soviets, decision, to, intervene, in, afghanistan, a, year, later, as, a, result, of, the, sino, soviet, split, tensions, along, the, chinese, soviet, border, reached, their, peak, in, 1969, united, states, president, richard, nixon, decided, to, use, the, conflict, to, shift, the, balance, of, power, towards, the, west, in, the, cold, war, through, a, policy, of, rapproachment, with, china, which, began, with, his, 1972, visit, to, china, and, culminated, in, 1979, with, the, signing, of, the, joint, communiqu, on, the, establishment, of, diplomatic, relations, by, president, carter, and, chinese, president, deng, xiaoping, although, indirect, conflict, between, cold, war, powers, continued, through, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, tensions, were, beginning, to, ease, following, the, ousting, of, khrushchev, another, period, of, collective, leadership, ensued, consisting, of, leonid, brezhnev, as, general, secretary, alexei, kosygin, as, premier, and, nikolai, podgorny, as, chairman, of, the, presidium, lasting, until, brezhnev, established, himself, in, the, early, 1970s, as, the, preeminent, soviet, leader, following, his, visit, to, china, nixon, met, with, soviet, leaders, including, brezhnev, in, moscow, these, strategic, arms, limitation, talks, resulted, in, two, landmark, arms, control, treaties, salt, i, the, first, comprehensive, limitation, pact, signed, by, the, two, superpowers, and, the, anti, ballistic, missile, treaty, which, banned, the, development, of, systems, designed, to, intercept, incoming, missiles, these, aimed, to, limit, the, development, of, costly, anti, ballistic, missiles, and, nuclear, missiles, nixon, and, brezhnev, proclaimed, a, new, era, of, peaceful, coexistence, and, established, the, groundbreaking, new, policy, of, d, tente, or, cooperation, between, the, two, superpowers, meanwhile, brezhnev, attempted, to, revive, the, soviet, economy, which, was, declining, in, part, because, of, heavy, military, expenditures, the, soviet, union, s, military, budget, in, the, 1970s, was, gigantic, forming, 40, 60, of, the, entire, federal, budget, and, accounting, to, 15, of, the, ussr, s, gdp, 13, in, the, 1980s, between, 1972, and, 1974, the, two, sides, also, agreed, to, strengthen, their, economic, ties, including, agreements, for, increased, trade, as, a, result, of, their, meetings, d, tente, would, replace, the, hostility, of, the, cold, war, and, the, two, countries, would, live, mutually, these, developments, coincided, with, bonn, s, ostpolitik, policy, formulated, by, the, west, german, chancellor, willy, brandt, an, effort, to, normalize, relations, between, west, germany, and, eastern, europe, other, agreements, were, concluded, to, stabilize, the, situation, in, europe, culminating, in, the, helsinki, accords, signed, at, the, conference, on, security, and, co, operation, in, europe, in, 1975, the, helsinki, accords, in, which, the, soviets, promised, to, grant, free, elections, in, europe, has, been, called, a, major, concession, to, ensure, peace, by, the, soviets, in, practice, the, soviet, government, significantly, curbed, the, rule, of, law, civil, liberties, protection, of, law, and, guarantees, of, property, which, were, considered, examples, of, bourgeois, morality, by, soviet, legal, theorists, such, as, andrey, vyshinsky, the, soviet, union, signed, legally, binding, human, rights, documents, such, as, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, in, 1973, and, the, helsinki, accords, in, 1975, but, they, were, neither, widely, known, or, accessible, to, people, living, under, communist, rule, nor, were, they, taken, seriously, by, the, communist, authorities, human, rights, activists, in, the, soviet, union, were, regularly, subjected, to, harassment, repressions, and, arrests, the, pro, soviet, american, business, magnate, armand, hammer, of, occidental, petroleum, often, mediated, trade, relations, author, daniel, yergin, in, his, book, the, prize, writes, that, hammer, ended, up, as, a, go, between, for, five, soviet, general, secretaries, and, seven, u, s, presidents, hammer, had, extensive, business, relationship, in, the, soviet, union, stretching, back, to, the, 1920s, with, lenin, s, approval, according, to, christian, science, monitor, in, 1980, although, his, business, dealings, with, the, soviet, union, were, cut, short, when, stalin, came, to, power, he, had, more, or, less, single, handedly, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, state, of, western, trade, with, the, soviet, union, in, 1974, brezhnev, publicly, recognized, hammer, s, role, in, facilitating, east, west, trade, by, 1981, according, to, the, new, york, times, in, that, year, hammer, was, on, a, first, name, basis, with, leonid, brezhnev, kissinger, and, nixon, were, realists, who, deemphasized, idealistic, goals, like, anti, communism, or, promotion, of, democracy, worldwide, because, those, goals, were, too, expensive, in, terms, of, america, s, economic, capabilities, instead, of, a, cold, war, they, wanted, peace, trade, and, cultural, exchanges, they, realized, that, americans, were, no, longer, willing, to, tax, themselves, for, idealistic, foreign, policy, goals, especially, for, containment, policies, that, never, seemed, to, produce, positive, results, instead, nixon, and, kissinger, sought, to, downsize, america, s, global, commitments, in, proportion, to, its, reduced, economic, moral, and, political, power, they, rejected, idealism, as, impractical, and, too, expensive, and, neither, man, showed, much, sensitivity, to, the, plight, of, people, living, under, communism, kissinger, s, realism, fell, out, of, fashion, as, idealism, returned, to, american, foreign, policy, with, carter, s, moralism, emphasizing, human, rights, and, reagan, s, rollback, strategy, aimed, at, destroying, communism, in, the, 1970s, the, kgb, led, by, yuri, andropov, continued, to, persecute, distinguished, soviet, dissidents, such, as, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, and, andrei, sakharov, who, were, criticising, the, soviet, leadership, in, harsh, terms, indirect, conflict, between, the, superpowers, continued, through, this, period, of, d, tente, in, the, third, world, particularly, during, political, crises, in, the, middle, east, chile, ethiopia, and, angola, in, 1973, nixon, announced, his, administration, was, committed, to, seeking, most, favored, nation, trade, status, with, the, ussr, which, was, challenged, by, congress, in, the, jackson, vanik, amendment, the, united, states, had, long, linked, trade, with, the, soviet, union, to, its, foreign, policy, toward, the, soviet, union, and, especially, since, the, early, 1980s, to, soviet, human, rights, policies, the, jackson, vanik, amendment, which, was, attached, to, the, 1974, trade, act, linked, the, granting, of, most, favored, nation, to, the, ussr, to, the, right, of, persecuted, soviet, jews, to, emigrate, because, the, soviet, union, refused, the, right, of, emigration, to, jewish, refuseniks, the, ability, of, the, president, to, apply, most, favored, nation, trade, status, to, the, soviet, union, was, restricted, although, president, jimmy, carter, tried, to, place, another, limit, on, the, arms, race, with, a, salt, ii, agreement, in, 1979, his, efforts, were, undermined, by, the, other, events, that, year, including, the, iranian, revolution, and, the, nicaraguan, revolution, which, both, ousted, pro, us, governments, and, his, retaliation, against, the, soviet, coup, in, afghanistan, in, december, the, term, new, cold, war, refers, to, the, period, of, intensive, reawakening, of, cold, war, tensions, and, conflicts, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, tensions, greatly, increased, between, the, major, powers, with, both, sides, becoming, more, militant, diggins, says, reagan, went, all, out, to, fight, the, second, cold, war, by, supporting, counterinsurgencies, in, the, third, world, cox, says, the, intensity, of, this, second, cold, war, was, as, great, as, its, duration, was, short, in, april, 1978, the, communist, people, s, democratic, party, of, afghanistan, pdpa, seized, power, in, afghanistan, in, the, saur,

against, government, forces, countrywide, the, islamic, unity, of, afghanistan, mujahideen, insurgents, received, military, training, and, weapons, in, neighboring, pakistan, and, china, while, the, soviet, union, sent, thousands, of, military, advisers, to, support, the, pdpa, government, meanwhile, increasing, friction, between, the, competing, factions, of, the, pdpa, the, dominant, khalq, and, the, more, moderate, parcham, resulted, in, the, dismissal, of, parchami, cabinet, members, and, the, arrest, of, parchami, military, officers, under, the, pretext, of, a, parchami, coup, by,

following, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, the, 1990s, revealed, that, the, soviet, leadership, believed, amin, had, secret, contacts, within, the, american, embassy, in, kabul, and, was, capable, of, reaching, an, agreement, with, the, united, states, however, allegations, of, amin, colluding, with, the, americans, have, been, widely, discredited, the, pdba, was, tasked, to, fill, the, vacuum, and, carried, out, a, purge, of, amin, supporters, soviet, troops, were, deployed, to, put, afghanistan, under, soviet, control, with, karmal, in, more, substantial, numbers, although, the, soviet, government, did, not, expect, to, do, most, of, the, fighting, in, afghanistan, as, a, result, however, the, soviets, were, now, directly, involved, in, what, had, been, a, domestic, war, in, afghanistan, carter, responded, to, the, soviet, invasion, by, withdrawing, the, salt, ii, treaty, from, ratification, imposing, embargoes, on, grain, and, technology, shipments, to, the, ussr, and, demanding, a, significant, increase, in, military, spending, and, further, announced, the, boycott, of, the, 1980, summer, olympics, in, moscow, which, was, joined, by, 65, other, nations, he, described, the, soviet, incursion, as, the, most, serious, threat, to, the, peace, since, the, second, world, war, in, january, 1977, four, years, prior, to, becoming, president, ronald, reagan, bluntly, stated, in, a, conversation, with, richard, v, allen, his, basic, expectation, in, relation, to, the, cold, war, my, idea, of, american, policy, toward, the, soviet, union, is, simple, and, some, would, say, simplistic, he, said, it, is, this, we, win, and, they, lose, what, do, you, think, of, that, in, 1980, ronald, reagan, defeated, jimmy, carter, in, the, 1980, presidential, election, vowing, to, increase, military, spending, and, confront, the, soviets, everywhere, both, reagan, and, new, british, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, denounced, the, soviet, union, and, its, ideology, reagan, labeled, the, soviet, union, an, evil, empire, and, predicted, that, communism, would, be, left, on, the, ash, heap, of, history, while, thatcher, inculpated, the, soviets, as, bent, on, world, dominance, in, 1982, reagan, tried, to, cut, off, moscow, s, access, to, hard, currency, by, impeding, its, proposed, gas, line, to, western, europe, it, hurt, the, soviet, economy, but, it, also, caused, ill, will, among, american, allies, in, europe, who, counted, on, that, revenue, reagan, retreated, on, this, issue, by, early, 1985, reagan, s, anti, communist, position, had, developed, into, a, stance, known, as, the, new, reagan, doctrine, which, in, addition, to, containment, formulated, an, additional, right, to, subvert, existing, communist, governments, besides, continuing, carter, s, policy, of, supporting, the, islamic, opponents, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, soviet, backed, pdpa, government, in, afghanistan, the, cia, also, sought, to, weaken, the, soviet, union, itself, by, promoting, islamism, in, the, majority, muslim, central, asian, soviet, union, additionally, the, cia, encouraged, anti, communist, pakistan, s, isi, to, train, muslims, from, around, the, world, to, participate, in, the, jihad, against, the, soviet, union, pope, john, paul, ii, provided, a, moral, focus, for, anti, communism, a, visit, to, his, native, poland, in, 1979, stimulated, a, religious, and, nationalist, resurgence, centered, on, the, solidarity, movement, trade, union, that, galvanized, opposition, and, may, have, led, to, his, attempted, assassination, two, years, later, in, december, 1981, poland, s, wojciech, jaruzelski, reacted, to, the, crisis, by, imposing, a, period, of, martial, law, reagan, imposed, economic, sanctions, on, poland, in, response, mikhail, suslov, the, kremlin, s, top, ideologist, advised, soviet, leaders, not, to, intervene, if, poland, fell, under, the, control, of, solidarity, for, fear, it, might, lead, to, heavy, economic, sanctions, resulting, in, a, catastrophe, for, the, soviet, economy, the, soviet, union, had, built, up, a, military, that, consumed, as, much, as, 25, percent, of, its, gross, national, product, at, the, expense, of, consumer, goods, and, investment, in, civilian, sectors, soviet, spending, on, the, arms, race, and, other, cold, war, commitments, both, caused, and, exacerbated, deep, seated, structural, problems, in, the, soviet, system, which, experienced, at, least, a, decade, of, economic, stagnation, during, the, late, brezhnev, years, soviet, investment, in, the, defense, sector, was, not, driven, by, military, necessity, but, in, large, part, by, the, interests, of, the, nomenklatura, which, was, dependent, on, the, sector, for, their, own, power, and, privileges, the, soviet, armed, forces, became, the, largest, in, the, world, in, terms, of, the, numbers, and, types, of, weapons, they, possessed, in, the, number, of, troops, in, their, ranks, and, in, the, sheer, size, of, their, military, industrial, base, however, the, quantitative, advantages, held, by, the, soviet, military, often, concealed, areas, where, the, eastern, bloc, dramatically, lagged, behind, the, west, for, example, the, persian, gulf, war, demonstrated, how, the, armor, fire, control, systems, and, firing, range, of, the, soviet, union, s, most, common, main, battle, tank, the, t, 72, were, drastically, inferior, to, the, american, m1, abrams, yet, the, ussr, fielded, almost, three, times, as, many, t, 72s, as, the, us, deployed, m1s, by, the, early, 1980s, the, ussr, had, built, up, a, military, arsenal, and, army, surpassing, that, of, the, united, states, soon, after, the, soviet, invasion, of, afghanistan, president, carter, began, massively, building, up, the, united, states, military, this, buildup, was, accelerated, by, the, reagan, administration, which, increased, the, military, spending, from, 5, 3, percent, of, gnp, in, 1981, to, 6, 5, percent, in, 1986, the, largest, peacetime, defense, buildup, in, united, states, history, the, american, soviet, tensions, present, during, 1983, was, defined, by, some, as, the, start, of, cold, war, ii, whilst, in, retrospective, this, phase, of, the, cold, war, was, generally, defined, as, a, war, of, words, the, soviet, s, peace, offensive, was, largely, rejected, by, the, west, tensions, continued, to, intensify, as, reagan, revived, the, b, 1, lancer, program, which, had, been, canceled, by, the, carter, administration, produced, lgm, 118, peacekeeper, missiles, installed, us, cruise, missiles, in, europe, and, announced, the, experimental, strategic, defense, initiative, dubbed, star, wars, by, the, media, a, defense, program, to, shoot, down, missiles, in, mid, flight, the, soviets, deployed, rsd, 10, pioneer, ballistic, missiles, targeting, western, europe, and, nato, decided, under, the, impetus, of, the, carter, presidency, to, deploy, mgm, 31, pershing, and, cruise, missiles, in, europe, primarily, west, germany, this, deployment, placed, missiles, just, 10, minutes, striking, distance, from, moscow, after, reagan, s, military, buildup, the, soviet, union, did, not, respond, by, further, building, its, military, because, the, enormous, military, expenses, along, with, inefficient, planned, manufacturing, and, collectivized, agriculture, were, already, a, heavy, burden, for, the, soviet, economy, at, the, same, time, saudi, arabia, increased, oil, production, even, as, other, non, opec, nations, were, increasing, production, these, developments, contributed, to, the, 1980s, oil, glut, which, affected, the, soviet, union, as, oil, was, the, main, source, of, soviet, export, revenues, issues, with, command, economics, oil, price, decreases, and, large, military, expenditures, gradually, brought, the, soviet, economy, to, stagnation, on, 1, september, 1983, the, soviet, union, shot, down, korean, air, lines, flight, 007, a, boeing, 747, with, 269, people, aboard, including, sitting, congressman, larry, mcdonald, an, action, which, reagan, characterized, as, a, massacre, the, airliner, was, en,

past, the, west, coast, of, sakhalin, island, near, moneron, island, the, soviet, air, force, treated, the, unidentified, aircraft, as, an, intruding, u, s, spy, plane, and, destroyed, it, with, air, to, air, missiles, the, soviet, union, found, the, wreckage, under, the, sea, two, weeks, later, on, 15, september, and, found, the, flight, recorders, in, october, but, this, information, was, kept, secret, by, the, soviet, authorities, until, after, the, country, s, collapse, the, incident, increased, support, for, military, deployment, overseen, by, reagan, which, stood, in, place, until, the, later, accords, between, reagan, and, mikhail, gorbachev, during, the, early, hours, of, 26, september, 1983, the, 1983, soviet, nuclear, false, alarm, incident, occurred, systems, in, serpukhov, 15, underwent, a, glitch, that, claimed, several, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, were, heading, towards, russia, but, officer, stanislav, petrov, correctly, suspected, it, was, a, false, alarm, ensuring, the, soviets, did, not, respond, to, the, non, existent, attack, as, such, he, has, been, credited, as, the, man, who, saved, the, world, the, able, archer, 83, exercise, in, november, 1983, a, realistic, simulation, of, a, coordinated, nato, nuclear, release, was, perhaps, the, most, dangerous, moment, since, the, cuban, missile, crisis, as, the, soviet, leadership, feared, that, a, nuclear, attack, might, be, imminent, american, domestic, public, concerns, about, intervening, in, foreign, conflicts, persisted, from, the, end, of, the, vietnam, war, the, reagan, administration, emphasized, the, use, of, quick, low, cost, counterinsurgency, tactics, to, intervene, in, foreign, conflicts, in, 1983, the, reagan, administration, intervened, in, the, multisided, lebanese, civil, war, invaded, grenada, bombed, libya, and, backed, the, central, american, contras, anti, communist, paramilitaries, seeking, to, overthrow, the, soviet, aligned, sandinista, government, in, nicaragua, while, reagan, s, interventions, against, grenada, and, libya, were, popular, in, the, united, states, his, backing, of, the, contra, rebels, was, mired, in, controversy, the, reagan, administration, s, backing, of, the, military, government, of, guatemala, during, the, guatemalan, civil, war, in, particular, the, regime, of, efra, n, r, os, montt, was, also, controversial, meanwhile, the, soviets, incurred, high, costs, for, their, own, foreign, interventions, although, brezhnev, was, convinced, in, 1979, that, the, soviet, war, in, afghanistan, would, be, brief, muslim, guerrillas, aided, by, the, us, china, britain, saudi, arabia, and, pakistan, waged, a, fierce, resistance, against, the, invasion, the, kremlin, sent, nearly, 100, 000, troops, to, support, its, puppet, regime, in, afghanistan, leading, many, outside, observers, to, dub, the, war, the, soviets, vietnam, however, moscow, s, quagmire, in, afghanistan, was, far, more, disastrous, for, the, soviets, than, vietnam, had, been, for, the, americans, because, the, conflict, coincided, with, a, period, of, internal, decay, and, domestic, crisis, in, the, soviet, system, a, senior, us, state, department, official, predicted, such, an, outcome, as, early, as, 1980, positing, that, the, invasion, resulted, in, part, from, a, domestic, crisis, within, the, soviet, system, it, may, be, that, the, thermodynamic, law, of, entropy, has, caught, up, with, the, soviet, system, which, now, seems, to, expend, more, energy, on, simply, maintaining, its, equilibrium, than, on, improving, itself, we, could, be, seeing, a, period, of, foreign, movement, at, a, time, of, internal, decay, by, the, time, the, comparatively, youthful, mikhail, gorbachev, became, general, secretary, in, 1985, the, soviet, economy, was, stagnant, and, faced, a, sharp, fall, in, foreign, currency, earnings, as, a, result, of, the, downward, slide, in, oil, prices, in, the, 1980s, these, issues, prompted, gorbachev, to, investigate, measures, to, revive, the, ailing, state, an, ineffectual, start, led, to, the, conclusion, that, deeper, structural, changes, were, necessary, and, in, june, 1987, gorbachev, announced, an, agenda, of, economic, reform, called, perestroika, or, restructuring, perestroika, relaxed, the, production, quota, system, allowed, cooperative, ownership, of, small, businesses, and, paved, the, way, for, foreign, investment, these, measures, were, intended, to, redirect, the, country, s, resources, from, costly, cold, war, military, commitments, to, more, productive, areas, in, the, civilian, sector, despite, initial, skepticism, in, the, west, the, new, soviet, leader, proved, to, be, committed, to, reversing, the, soviet, union, s, deteriorating, economic, condition, instead, of, continuing, the, arms, race, with, the, west, partly, as, a, way, to, fight, off, internal, opposition, from, party, cliques, to, his, reforms, gorbachev, simultaneously, introduced, glasnost, or, openness, which, increased, freedom, of, the, press, and, the, transparency, of, state, institutions, glasnost, was, intended, to, reduce, the, corruption, at, the, top, of, the, communist, party, and, moderate, the, abuse, of, power, in, the, central, committee, glasnost, also, enabled, increased, contact, between, soviet, citizens, and, the, western, world, particularly, with, the, united, states, contributing, to, the, accelerating, d, tente, between, the, two, nations, in, response, to, the, kremlin, s, military, and, political, concessions, reagan, agreed, to, renew, talks, on, economic, issues, and, the, scaling, back, of, the, arms, race, the, first, summit, was, held, in, november, 1985, in, geneva, switzerland, a, second, summit, was, held, in, october, 1986, in, reykjav, k, iceland, talks, went, well, until, the, focus, shifted, to, reagan, s, proposed, strategic, defense, initiative, sdi, which, gorbachev, wanted, to, be, eliminated, reagan, refused, the, negotiations, failed, but, the, third, summit, washington, summit, 1987, 8, 10, december, 1987, led, to, a, breakthrough, with, the, signing, of, the, intermediate, range, nuclear, forces, treaty, inf, the, inf, treaty, eliminated, all, nuclear, armed, ground, launched, ballistic, and, cruise, missiles, with, ranges, between, 500, and, 5, 500, kilometers, 310, and, 3, 420, mi, and, their, infrastructure, during, 1988, it, became, apparent, to, the, soviets, that, oil, and, gas, subsidies, along, with, the, cost, of, maintaining, massive, troops, levels, represented, a, substantial, economic, drain, in, addition, the, security, advantage, of, a, buffer, zone, was, recognised, as, irrelevant, and, the, soviets, officially, declared, that, they, would, no, longer, intervene, in, the, affairs, of, satellite, states, in, central, and, eastern, europe, george, h, w, bush, and, gorbachev, met, at, the, moscow, summit, in, may, 1988, and, the, governors, island, summit, in, december, 1988, in, 1989, soviet, forces, withdrew, from, afghanistan, without, achieving, their, objectives, later, that, year, the, berlin, wall, the, inner, german, border, and, the, iron, curtain, fell, on, 3, december, 1989, gorbachev, and, bush, declared, the, cold, war, over, at, the, malta, summit, in, february, 1990, gorbachev, agreed, with, the, us, proposed, treaty, on, the, final, settlement, with, respect, to, germany, and, signed, it, on, 12, september, 1990, paving, the, way, for, the, german, reunification, when, the, berlin, wall, came, down, gorbachev, s, common, european, home, concept, began, to, take, shape, the, two, former, adversaries, were, partners, in, the, gulf, war, against, iraq, august, 1990, february, 1991, during, the, final, summit, in, moscow, in, july, 1991, gorbachev, and, bush, signed, the, start, i, arms, control, treaty, two, developments, dominated, the, decade, that, followed, the, increasingly, apparent, crumbling, of, the, soviet, union, s, economic, and, political, structures, and, the, patchwork, attempts, at, reforms, to, reverse, that, process, kenneth, s, deffeyes, argued, in, beyond, oil, that, the, reagan, administration, encouraged, saudi, arabia, to, lower, the, price, of, oil, to, the, point, where, the, soviets, could, not, make, a, profit, selling, their, oil, and, resulted, in, the, depletion, of, the, country, s, hard, currency, reserves, brezhnev, s, next, two, successors, transitional, figures, with, deep, roots, in, his, tradition, did, not, last, long, yuri, andropov, was, 68, years, old, and, konstantin, chernenko, 72, when, they, assumed, power, both, died, in, less, than, two, years, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, a, third, short, lived, leader, in, 1985, the, soviets, turned, to, the, next, generation, and, selected, mikhail, gorbachev, he, made, significant, changes, in, the, economy, and, party, leadership, called, perestroika, his, policy, of, glasnost, freed, public, access, to, information, after, decades, of, heavy, government, censorship, gorbachev, also, moved, to, end, the, cold, war, in, 1988, the, ussr, abandoned, its, war, in, afghanistan, and, began, to, withdraw, its, forces, in, the, following, year, gorbachev, refused, to, interfere, in, the, internal, affairs, of, the, soviet, satellite, states, which, paved, the, way, for, the, revolutions, of, 1989, in, particular, the, standstill, of, the, soviet, union, at, the, pan, european, picnic, in, august, 1989, then, set, a, peaceful, chain, reaction, in, motion, at, the, end, of, which, the, eastern, bloc, collapsed, with, the, tearing, down, of, the, berlin, wall, and, with, east, and, west, germany, pursuing, re, unification, the, iron, curtain, between, the, west, and, soviet, occupied, regions, came, down, by, 1989, the, soviet, alliance, system, was, on, the, brink, of, collapse, and, deprived, of, soviet, military, support, the, communist, leaders, of, the, warsaw, pact, states, were, losing, power, grassroots, organizations, such, as, poland, s, solidarity, movement, rapidly, gained, ground, with, strong, popular, bases, the, pan, european, picnic, in, august, 1989, in, hungary, finally, started, a, peaceful, movement, that, the, rulers, in, the, eastern, bloc, could, not, stop, it, was, the, largest, movement, of, refugees, from, east, germany, since, the, berlin, wall, was, built, in, 1961, and, ultimately, brought, about, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, the, patrons, of, the, picnic, otto, von, habsburg, and, the, hungarian, minister, of, state, imre, pozsgay, saw, the, planned, event, as, an, opportunity, to, test, mikhail, gorbachev, s, reaction, the, austrian, branch, of, the, paneuropean, union, which, was, then, headed, by, karl, von, habsburg, distributed, thousands, of, brochures, inviting, the, gdr, holidaymakers, in, hungary, to, a, picnic, near, the, border, at, sopron, but, with, the, mass, exodus, at, the, pan, european, picnic, the, subsequent, hesitant, behavior, of, the, ruling, socialist, unity, party, of, east, germany, and, the, non, interference, of, the, soviet, union, broke, the, dams, now, tens, of, thousands, of, media, informed, east, germans, made, their, way, to, hungary, which, was, no, longer, willing, to, keep, its, borders, completely, closed, or, to, oblige, its, border, troops, to, use, armed, force, on, the, one, hand, this, caused, disagreement, among, the, eastern, european, states, and, on, the, other, hand, it, was, clear, to, the, eastern, european, population, that, the, governments, no, longer, had, absolute, power, in, 1989, the, communist, governments, in, poland, and, hungary, became, the, first, to, negotiate, the, organization, of, competitive, elections, in, czechoslovakia, and, east, germany, mass, protests, unseated, entrenched, communist, leaders, the, communist, regimes, in, bulgaria, and, romania, also, crumbled, in, the, latter, case, as, the, result, of, a, violent, uprising, attitudes, had, changed, enough, that, us, secretary, of, state, james, baker, suggested, that, the, american, government, would, not, be, opposed, to, soviet, intervention, in, romania, on, behalf, of, the, opposition, to, prevent, bloodshed, the, tidal, wave, of, change, culminated, with, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, in, november, 1989, which, symbolized, the, collapse, of, european, communist, governments, and, graphically, ended, the, iron, curtain, divide, of, europe, the, 1989, revolutionary, wave, swept, across, central, and, eastern, europe, and, peacefully, overthrew, all, of, the, soviet, style, marxist, leninist, states, east, germany, poland, hungary, czechoslovakia, and, bulgaria, romania, was, the, only, eastern, bloc, country, to, topple, its, communist, regime, violently, and, execute, its, head, of, state, at, the, same, time, the, soviet, republics, started, legal, moves, towards, potentially, declaring, sovereignty, over, their, territories, citing, the, freedom, to, secede, in, article, 72, of, the, ussr, constitution, on, 7, april, 1990, a, law, was, passed, allowing, a, republic, to, secede, if, more, than, two, thirds, of, its, residents, voted, for, it, in, a, referendum, many, held, their, first, free, elections, in, the, soviet, era, for, their, own, national, legislatures, in, 1990, many, of, these, legislatures, proceeded, to, produce, legislation, contradicting, the, union, laws, in, what, was, known, as, the, war, of, laws, in, 1989, the, russian, sfsr, convened, a, newly, elected, congress, of, people, s, deputies, boris, yeltsin, was, elected, its, chairman, on, 12, june, 1990, the, congress, declared, russia, s, sovereignty, over, its, territory, and, proceeded, to, pass, laws, that, attempted, to, supersede, some, of, the, soviet, laws, after, a, landslide, victory, of, s, j, dis, in, lithuania, that, country, declared, its, independence, restored, on, 11, march, 1990, citing, the, illegality, of, the, soviet, occupation, of, the, baltic, states, soviet, forces, attempted, to, halt, the, secession, by, crushing, popular, demonstrations, in, lithuania, bloody, sunday, and, latvia, the, barricades, as, a, result, numerous, civilians, were, killed, or, wounded, however, these, actions, only, bolstered, international, support, for, the, secessionists, a, referendum, for, the, preservation, of, the, ussr, was, held, on, 17, march, 1991, in, nine, republics, the, remainder, having, boycotted, the, vote, with, the, majority, of, the, population, in, those, republics, voting, for, preservation, of, the, union, in, the, form, of, a, new, federation, the, referendum, gave, gorbachev, a, minor, boost, in, the, summer, of, 1991, the, new, union, treaty, which, would, have, turned, the, country, into, a, much, looser, union, was, agreed, upon, by, eight, republics, the, signing, of, the, treaty, however, was, interrupted, by, the, august, coup, an, attempted, coup, d, tat, by, hardline, members, of, the, government, and, the, kgb, who, sought, to, reverse, gorbachev, s, reforms, and, reassert, the, central, government, s, control, over, the, republics, after, the, coup, collapsed, russian, president, yeltsin, was, seen, as, a, hero, for, his, decisive, actions, while, gorbachev, s, power, was, effectively, ended, the, balance, of, power, tipped, significantly, towards, the, republics, in, august, 1991, latvia, and, estonia, immediately, declared, the, restoration, of, their, full, independence, following, lithuania, s, 1990, example, gorbachev, resigned, as, general, secretary, in, late, august, and, soon, afterwards, the, party, s, activities, were, indefinitely, suspended, effectively, ending, its, rule, by, the, fall, gorbachev, could, no, longer, influence, events, outside, moscow, and, he, was, being, challenged, even, there, by, yeltsin, who, had, been, elected, president, of, russia, in, july, 1991, later, in, august, gorbachev, resigned, as, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, and, russian, president, boris, yeltsin, ordered, the, seizure, of, soviet, property, gorbachev, clung, to, power, as, the, president, of, the, soviet, union, until, 25, december, 1991, when, the, ussr, dissolved, fifteen, states, emerged, from, the, soviet, union, with, by, far, the, largest, and, most, populous, one, which, also, was, the, founder, of, the, soviet, state, with, the, october, revolution, in, petrograd, the, russian, federation, taking, full, responsibility, for, all, the, rights, and, obligations, of, the, ussr, under, the, charter, of, the, united, nations, including, the, financial, obligations, as, such, russia, assumed, the, soviet, union, s, un, membership, and, permanent, membership, on, the, security, council, nuclear, stockpile, and, the, control, over, the, armed, forces, soviet, embassies, abroad, became, russian, embassies, in, his, 1992, state, of,

god, america, won, the, cold, war, bush, and, yeltsin, met, in, february, 1992, declaring, a, new, era, of, friendship, and, partnership, in, january, 1993, bush, and, yeltsin, agreed, to, start, ii, which, provided, for, further, nuclear, arms, reductions, on, top, of, the, original, start, treaty, in, summing, up, the, international, ramifications, of, these, events, vladislav, zubok, stated, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, empire, was, an, event, of, epochal, geopolitical, military, ideological, and, economic, significance, after, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, russia, drastically, cut, military, spending, and, restructuring, the, economy, left, millions, unemployed, according, to, western, analysis, the, neoliberal, reforms, in, russia, culminated, in, a, recession, in, the, early, 1990s, more, severe, than, the, great, depression, as, experienced, by, the, united, states, and, germany, western, analysts, suggest, that, in, the, 25, years, following, the, end, of, the, cold, war, only, five, or, six, of, the, post, communist, states, are, on, a, path, to, joining, the, rich, and, capitalist, world, while, most, are, falling, behind, some, to, such, an, extent, that, it, will, take, several, decades, to, catch, up, to, where, they, were, before, the, collapse, of, communism, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, consider, themselves, as, revivals, of, the, three, independent, countries, that, existed, prior, to, their, occupation, and, annexation, by, the, soviet, union, in, 1940, they, maintain, that, the, process, by, which, they, were, incorporated, into, the, soviet, union, violated, both, international, law, and, their, own, law, and, that, in, 1990, 1991, they, were, reasserting, an, independence, that, still, legally, existed, communist, parties, outside, the, baltic, states, were, not, outlawed, and, their, members, were, not, prosecuted, just, a, few, places, attempted, to, exclude, members, of, communist, secret, services, from, decision, making, in, some, countries, the, communist, party, changed, its, name, and, continued, to, function, stephen, holmes, of, the, university, of, chicago, argued, in, 1996, that, decommunization, after, a, brief, active, period, quickly, ended, in, near, universal, failure, after, the, introduction, of, lustration, demand, for, scapegoats, has, become, relatively, low, and, former, communists, have, been, elected, for, high, governmental, and, other, administrative, positions, holmes, notes, that, the, only, real, exception, was, former, east, germany, where, thousands, of, former, stasi, informers, have, been, fired, from, public, positions, holmes, suggests, the, following, reasons, for, the, failure, of, decommunization, compared, with, the, decommunization, efforts, of, the, other, former, constituents, of, the, eastern, bloc, and, the, soviet, union, decommunization, in, russia, has, been, restricted, to, half, measures, if, conducted, at, all, notable, anti, communist, measures, in, the, russian, federation, include, the, banning, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, creation, of, the, communist, party, of, the, russian, federation, as, well, as, changing, the, names, of, some, russian, cities, back, to, what, they, were, before, the, 1917, october, revolution, leningrad, to, saint, petersburg, sverdlovsk, to, yekaterinburg, and, gorky, to, nizhny, novgorod, though, others, were, maintained, with, ulyanovsk, former, simbirsk, tolyatti, former, stavropol, and, kirov, former, vyatka, being, examples, even, though, leningrad, and, sverdlovsk, were, renamed, regions, that, were, named, after, them, are, still, officially, called, leningrad, and, sverdlovsk, oblasts, nostalgia, for, the, soviet, union, is, gradually, on, the, rise, in, russia, communist, symbols, continue, to, form, an, important, part, of, the, rhetoric, used, in, state, controlled, media, as, banning, on, them, in, other, countries, is, seen, by, the, russian, foreign, ministry, as, sacrilege, and, a, perverse, idea, of, good, and, evil, the, process, of, decommunization, in, ukraine, a, neighbouring, post, soviet, state, was, met, with, fierce, criticism, by, russia, who, regularly, dismisses, soviet, war, crimes, the, state, anthem, of, the, russian, federation, adopted, in, 2000, the, same, year, vladimir, putin, began, his, first, term, as, president, of, russia, uses, the, exact, same, music, as, the, state, anthem, of, the, soviet, union, but, with, new, lyrics, written, by, sergey,

period, for, the, removal, of, communist, monuments, excluding, world, war, ii, monuments, and, renaming, of, public, places, named, after, communist, related, themes, at, the, time, this, meant, that, 22, cities, and, 44, villages, were, set, to, get, new, names, until, 21, november, 2015, municipal, governments, had, the, authority, to, implement, this, if, they, failed, to, do, so, the, oblasts, of, ukraine, had, until, 21, may, 2016, to, change, the, names, if, after, that, date, the, settlement, had, retained, its, old, name, the, cabinet, of, ministers, of, ukraine, would, wield, authority, to, assign, a, new, name, to, the, settlement, in, 2016, 51, 493, streets, and, 987, cities, and, villages, were, renamed, and, 1, 320, lenin, monuments, and, 1, 069, monuments, to, other,
