linked, by, the, interior, mass, of, the, eurasian, steppe, see, history, of, the, middle, east, and, history, of, the, indian, subcontinent, for, further, details, on, those, regions, the, coastal, periphery, was, the, home, to, some, of, the, world, s, earliest, known, civilizations, and, religions, with, each, of, three, regions, developing, early, civilizations, around, fertile, river, valleys, these, valleys, were, fertile, because, the, soil, there, was, rich, and, could, bear, many, root, crops, the, civilizations, in, mesopotamia, ancient, india, and, ancient, china, shared, many, similarities, and, likely, exchanged, technologies, and, ideas, such, as, mathematics, and, the, wheel, other, notions, such, as, that, of, writing, likely, developed, individually, in, each, area, cities, states, and, then, empires, developed, in, these, lowlands, the, steppe, region, had, long, been, inhabited, by, mounted, nomads, and, from, the, central, steppes, they, could, reach, all, areas, of, the, asian, continent, the, northern, part, of, the, continent, covering, much, of, siberia, was, also, inaccessible, to, the, steppe, nomads, due, to, the, dense, forests, and, the, tundra, these, areas, in, siberia, were, very, sparsely, populated, the, centre, and, periphery, were, kept, separate, by, mountains, and, deserts, the, caucasus, himalaya, karakum, desert, and, gobi, desert, formed, barriers, that, the, steppe, horsemen, could, only, cross, with, difficulty, while, technologically, and, culturally, the, city, dwellers, were, more, advanced, they, could, do, little, militarily, to, defend, against, the, mounted, hordes, of, the, steppe, however, the, lowlands, did, not, have, enough, open, grasslands, to, support, a, large, horsebound, force, thus, the, nomads, who, conquered, states, in, the, middle, east, were, soon, forced, to, adapt, to, the, local, societies, the, spread, of, islam, waved, the, islamic, golden, age, and, the, timurid,

the, 580s, amongst, the, divided, factions, of, china, this, was, started, when, an, aristocrat, named, yang, jian, married, his, daughter, into, the, northern, zhou, dynasty, he, proclaimed, himself,

buddhism, was, empress, wu, who, additionally, claimed, an, unofficial, zhou, dynasty, and, displayed, china, s, tolerance, of, a, woman, ruler, which, was, rare, at, the, time, however, buddhism, would, also, experience, some, backlash, especially, from, confucianists, and, taoists, this, would, usually, involve, criticism, about, how, it, was, costing, the, state, money, since, the, government, was, unable, to, tax, buddhist, monasteries, and, additionally, sent, many, grants, and, gifts, to, them, p, 273, the, tang, dynasty, began, to, decline, under, the, rule, of, emperor,

khitan, people, from, then, on, the, song, would, have, to, pay, tribute, to, avoid, invasion, and, thus, set, the, precedent, for, other, nomadic, kingdoms, to, oppress, them, the, song, also, saw, the, revival, of, confucianism, in, the, form, of, neo, confucianism, this, had, the, effect, of, putting, the, confucian, scholars, at, a, higher, status, than, aristocrats, or, buddhists, and, also, intensified, the, reduction, of, power, in, women, the, infamous, practice, of, foot, binding, developed, in, this, period, as, a, result, eventually, the, liao, dynasty, in, the, north, was, overthrown, by, the, jin, dynasty, of, the, manchu, related, jurchen, people, the, new, jin, kingdom, invaded, northern, china, leaving, the, song, to, flee, farther, south, and, creating, the,

under, control, of, the, mongols, marking, the, first, time, they, were, ever, completely, conquered, by, a, foreign, invader, the, new, capital, was, established, at, khanbaliq, modern, day, beijing, kublai, khan, segregated, mongol, culture, from, chinese, culture, by, discouraging, interactions, between, the, two, peoples, separating, living, spaces, and, places, of, worship, and, reserving, top, administrative, positions, to, mongols, thus, preventing, confucian, scholars, to, continue, the, bureaucratic, system, nevertheless, kublai, remained, fascinated, with, chinese, thinking, surrounding, himself, with, chinese, buddhist, taoist, or, confucian, advisors, mongol, women, displayed, a, contrasting, independent, nature, compared, to, the, chinese, women, who, continued, to, be, suppressed, mongol, women, often, rode, out, on, hunts, or, even, to, war, kublai, s, wife, chabi, was, a, perfect, example, of, this, chabi, advised, her, husband, on, several, political, and, diplomatic, matters, she, convinced, him, that, the, chinese, were, to, be, respected, and, well, treated, in, order, to, make, them, easier, to, rule, p, 327, however, this, was, not, enough, to, affect, chinese, women, s, position, and, the, increasingly, neo, confucian, successors, of, kublai, further, repressed, chinese, and, even, mongol, women, the, black, death, which, would, later, ravage, western, europe, had, its, beginnings, in, asia, where, it, wiped, out, large, populations, in, china, in, 1331, japan, s, medieval, history, began, with, the, asuka, period, from, around, 600, to, 710, the, time, was, characterized, by, the, taika, reform, and, imperial, centralization, both, of, which, were, a, direct, result, of, growing, chinese, contact, and, influences, in, 603, prince, sh, toku, of, the, yamato, dynasty, began, significant, political, and, cultural, changes, he, issued, the, seventeen, article, constitution, in, 604, centralizing, power, towards, the, emperor, under, the, title, tenno, or, heavenly, sovereign, and, removing, the, power, to, levy, taxes, from, provincial, lords, sh, toku, was, also, a, patron, of, buddhism, and, he, encouraged, building, temples, competitively, sh, toku, s, reforms, transitioned, japan, to, the, nara, period, c, 710, to, c, 794, with, the, moving, of, the, japanese, capital, to, nara, in, honshu, this, period, saw, the, culmination, of, chinese, style, writing, etiquette, and, architecture, in, japan, along, with, confucian, ideals, to, supplement, the, already, present, buddhism, peasants, revered, both, confucian, scholars, and, buddhist, monks, however, in, the, wake, of, the, 735, 737, japanese, smallpox, epidemic, buddhism, gained, the, status, of, state, religion, and, the, government, ordered, the, construction, of, numerous, buddhist, temples, monasteries, and, statues, the, lavish, spending, combined, with, the, fact, that, many, aristocrats, did, not, pay, taxes, put, a, heavy, burden, on, peasantry, that, caused, poverty, and, famine, eventually, the, buddhist, position, got, out, of, control, threatening, to, seize, imperial, power, and, causing, emperor, kanmu, to, move, the, capital, to, heian, ky, to, avoid, a, buddhist, takeover, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, heian, period, and, the, end, of, taika, reform, with, the, heian, period, from, 794, to, 1185, came, a, decline, of, imperial, power, chinese, influence, also, declined, as, a, result, of, its, correlation, with, imperial, centralization, and, the, heavenly, mandate, which, came, to, be, regarded, as, ineffective, by, 838, the, japanese, court, discontinued, its, embassies, in, china, only, traders, and, buddhist, monks, continued, to, travel, to, china, buddhism, itself, came, to, be, considered, more, japanese, than, chinese, and, persisted, to, be, popular, in, japan, buddhists, monks, and, monasteries, continued, their, attempts, to, gather, personal, power, in, courts,

the, imperial, court, regional, lords, also, began, to, build, their, own, armies, these, warriors, were, loyal, only, their, local, lords, and, not, the, emperor, although, the, imperial, government, increasingly, called, them, in, to, protect, the, capital, the, regional, warrior, class, developed, into, the, samurai, which, created, its, own, culture, including, specialized, weapons, such, as, the, katana, and, a, form, of, chivalry, bushido, the, imperial, government, s, loss, of, control, in, the, second, half, of, the, heian, period, allowed, banditry, to, grow, requiring, both, feudal, lords, and, buddhist, monasteries, to, procure, warriors, for, protection, as, imperial, control, over, japan, declined, feudal, lords, also, became, more, independent, and, seceded, from, the,

samurai, class, being, physically, set, off, by, dress, and, weapon, restrictions, as, a, result, of, their, oppression, many, peasants, turned, to, buddhism, as, a, hope, for, reward, in, the, afterlife, for, upright, behavior, with, the, increase, of, feudalism, families, in, the, imperial, court, began, to, depend, on, alliances, with, regional, lords, the, fujiwara, clan, declined, from, power, replaced, by, a, rivalry, between, the, taira, clan, and, the, minamoto, clan, this, rivalry, grew, into, the, genpei, war, in, the, early, 1180s, this, war, saw, the, use, of, both, samurai, and, peasant, soldiers, for, the, samurai, battle, was, ritual, and, they, often, easily, cut, down, the, poorly, trained, peasantry, the, minamoto, clan, proved, successful, due, to, their, rural,

asia, from, the, 17th, century, and, would, eventually, take, control, of, all, of, siberia, and, most, of, central, asia, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, ottoman, empire, controlled, anatolia, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, the, balkans, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, in, the, 17th, century, the, manchu, conquered, china, and, established, the, qing, dynasty, in, the, 16th, century, the, mughal, empire, controlled, much, of, india, and, initiated, the, second, golden, age, for, india, china, was, the, largest, economy, in, the, world, for, much, of, the, time, followed, by, india, until, the, 18th, century, by, 1368, zhu, yuanzhang, had, claimed, himself, hongwu, emperor, and, established, the, ming, dynasty, of, china, immediately, the, new, emperor, and, his, followers, drove, the, mongols, and, their, culture, out, of, china, and, beyond, the, great, wall, p, 503, the, new, emperor, was, somewhat, suspicious, of, the, scholars, that, dominated, china, s, bureaucracy, for, he, had, been, born, a, peasant, and, was, uneducated, p, 503, nevertheless, confucian, scholars, were, necessary, to, china, s, bureaucracy, and, were, reestablished, as, well, as, reforms, that, would, improve, the, exam, systems, and, make, them, more, important, in, entering, the, bureaucracy, than, ever, before, the, exams, became, more, rigorous, cut, down, harshly, on, cheating, and, those, who, excelled, were, more, highly, appraised, finally, hongwu, also, directed, more, power, towards, the, role, of, emperor, so, as, to, end, the, corrupt, influences, of, the, bureaucrats, the, hongwu, emperor, perhaps, for, his, sympathy, of, the, common, folk, had, built, many, irrigation, systems, and, other, public, projects, that, provided, help, for, the, peasant, farmers, p, 504, they, were, also, allowed, to, cultivate, and, claim, unoccupied, land, without, having, to, pay, any, taxes, and, labor, demands, were, lowered, p, 504, however, none, of, this, was, able, to, stop, the, rising, landlord, class, that, gained, many, privileges, from, the, government, and, slowly, gained, control, of, the, peasantry, moneylenders, foreclosed, on, peasant, debt, in, exchange, for, mortgages, and, bought, up, farmer, land, forcing, them, to, become, the, landlords, tenants, or, to, wander, elsewhere, for, work, also, during, this, time, neo, confucianism, intensified, even, more, than, the, previous, two, dynasties, the, song, and, yuan, focus, on, the, superiority, of, elders, over, youth, men, over, women, and, teachers, over, students, resulted, in, minor, discrimination, of, the, inferior, classes, the, fine, arts, grew, in, the, ming, era, with, improved, techniques, in, brush, painting, that, depicted, scenes, of, court, city, or, country, life, people, such, as, scholars, or, travelers, or, the, beauty, of, mountains, lakes, or, marshes, the, chinese, novel, fully, developed, in, this, era, with, such, classics, written, such, as, water, margin, journey, to, the, west, and, jin, ping, mei, economics, grew, rapidly, in, the, ming, dynasty, as, well, the, introduction, of, american, crops, such, as, maize, sweet, potatoes, and, peanuts, allowed, for, cultivation, of, crops, in, infertile, land, and, helped, prevent, famine, the, population, boom, that, began, in, the, song, dynasty, accelerated, until, china, s, population, went, from, 80, or, 90, million, to, 150, million, in, three, centuries, culminating, in, 1600, p, 507, this, paralleled, the, market, economy, that, was, growing, both, internally, and, externally, silk, tea, ceramics, and, lacquer, ware, were, produced, by, artisans, that, traded, them, in, asia, and, to, europeans, westerners, began, to, trade, with, some, chinese, assigned, limits, primarily, in, the, port, towns, of, macau, and, canton, although, merchants, benefited, greatly, from, this, land, remained, the, primary, symbol, of, wealth, in, china, and, traders, riches, were, often, put, into, acquiring, more, land, p, 507, therefore, little, of, these, riches, were, used, in, private, enterprises, that, could, ve, allowed, for, china, to, develop, the, market, economy, that, often, accompanied, the, highly, successful, western, countries, in, the, interest, of, national, glory, the, chinese, began, sending, impressive, junk, ships, across, the, south, china, sea, and, the, indian, ocean, from, 1403, to, 1433, the, yongle, emperor, commissioned, expeditions, led, by, the, admiral, zheng, he, a, muslim, eunuch, from, china, chinese, junks, carrying, hundreds, of, soldiers, goods, and, animals, for, zoos, traveled, to, southeast, asia, persia, southern, arabia, and, east, africa, to, show, off, chinese, power, their, prowess, exceeded, that, of, current, europeans, at, the, time, and, had, these, expeditions, not, ended, the, world, economy, may, be, different, from, today, p, 339, in, 1433, the, chinese, government, decided, that, the, cost, of, a, navy, was, an, unnecessary, expense, the, chinese, navy, was, slowly, dismantled, and, focus, on, interior, reform, and, military, defense, began, it, was, china, s, longstanding, priority, that, they, protect, themselves, from, nomads, and, they, have, accordingly, returned, to, it, the, growing, limits, on, the, chinese, navy, would, leave, them, vulnerable, to, foreign, invasion, by, sea, later, on, as, was, inevitable, westerners, arrived, on, the, chinese, east, coast, primarily, jesuit, missionaries, which, reached, the, mainland, in, 1582, they, attempted, to, convert, the, chinese, people, to, christianity, by, first, converting, the, top, of, the, social, hierarchy, and, allowing, the, lower, classes, to, subsequently, convert, to, further, gain, support, many, jesuits, adopted, chinese, dress, customs, and, language, p, 508, some, chinese, scholars, were, interested, in, certain, western, teachings, and, especially, in, western, technology, by, the, 1580s, jesuit, scholars, like, matteo, ricci, and, adam, schall, amazed, the, chinese, elite, with, technological, advances, such, as, european, clocks, improved, calendars, and, cannons, and, the, accurate, prediction, of, eclipses, p, 508, although, some, the, scholar, gentry, converted, many, were, suspicious, of, the, westerners, whom, they, called, barbarians, and, even, resented, them, for, the, embarrassment, they, received, at, the, hand, of, western, correction, nevertheless, a, small, group, of, jesuit, scholars, remained, at, the, court, to, impress, the, emperor, and, his, advisors, near, the, end, of, the, 1500s, the, extremely, centralized, government, that, gave, so, much, power, to, the, emperor, had, begun, to, fail, as, more, incompetent, rulers, took, the, mantle, along, with, these, weak, rulers, came, increasingly, corrupt, officials, who, took, advantage, of, the, decline, once, more, the, public, projects, fell, into, disrepair, due, to, neglect, by, the, bureaucracy, and, resulted, in, floods, drought, and, famine, that, rocked, the, peasantry, the, famine, soon, became, so, terrible, that, some, peasants, resorted, to, selling, their, children, to, slavery, to, save, them, from, starvation, or, to, eating, bark, the, feces, of, geese, or, other, people, p, 509, many, landlords, abused, the, situation, by, building, large, estates, where, desperate, farmers, would, work, and, be, exploited, in, turn, many, of, these, farmers, resorted, to, flight, banditry, and, open, rebellion, all, of, this, corresponded, with, the, usual, dynastic, decline, of, china, seen, before, as, well, as, the, growing, foreign, threats, in, the, mid, 16th, century, japanese, and, ethnic, chinese, pirates, began, to, raid, the, southern, coast, and, neither, the, bureaucracy, nor, the, military, were, able, to, stop, them, p, 510, the, threat, of, the, northern, manchu, people, also, grew, the, manchu, were, an, already, large, state, north, of, china, when, in, the, early, 17th, century, a, local, leader, named, nurhaci, suddenly, united, them, under, the, eight, banners, armies, that, the, opposing, families, were, organized, into, the, manchus, adopted, many, chinese, customs, specifically, taking, after, their, bureaucracy, nevertheless, the, manchus, still, remained, a, chinese, vassal, in, 1644, chinese, administration, became, so, weak, the, 16th, and, last, emperor, the, chongzhen, emperor, did, not, respond, to, the, severity, of, an, ensuing, rebellion, by, local, dissenters, until, the, enemy, had, invaded, the, forbidden, city, his, personal, estate, he, soon, hanged, himself, in, the, imperial, gardens, p, 510, for, a, brief, amount, of, time, the, shun, dynasty, was, claimed, until, a, loyalist, ming, official, called, support, from, the, manchus, to, put, down, the, new, dynasty, the, shun, dynasty, ended, within, a, year, and, the, manchu, were, now, within, the, great, wall, taking, advantage, of, the, situation, the, manchus, marched, on, the, chinese, capital, of, beijing, within, two, decades, all, of, china, belonged, to, the, manchu, and, the, qing, dynasty, was, established, in, early, modern, korea, the, 500, year, old, kingdom, goryeo, fell, and, new, dynasty, joseon, rose, in, august, 5, 1392, taejo, of, joseon, changed, the, country, s, name, from, goryeo, to, joseon, sejong, the, great, created, hangul, the, modern, korean, alphabet, in, 1443, likewise, the, joseon, dynasty, saw, several, improvements, in, science, and, technology, like, sun, clocks, water, clocks, rain, measuring, systems, star, maps, and, detailed, records, of, korean, small, villages, the, ninth, king, seongjong, accomplished, the, first, complete, korean, law, code, in, 1485, so, the, culture, and, people, s, lives, were, improved, again, in, 1592, japan, under, toyotomi, hideyoshi, invaded, korea, that, war, is, imjin, war, before, that, war, joseon, was, in, a, long, peace, like, pax, romana, so, joseon, was, not, ready, for, the, war, joseon, had, lost, again, and, again, japanese, army, conquered, seoul, the, whole, korean, peninsula, was, in, danger, but, yi, sun, sin, the, most, renowned, general, of, korea, defeated, japanese, fleet, in, southern, korea, coast, even, 13, ships, vs, 133, ships, this, incredible, battle, is, called, battle, of, myeongnyang, after, that, ming, dynasty, helped, joseon, and, japan, lost, the, battle, so, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, campaign, in, korea, failed, and, the, tokugawa, shogunate, has, later, began, korea, was, hurt, a, lot, at, imjin, war, not, long, after, manchurian, people, invaded, joseon, again, it, is, called, qing, invasion, of, joseon, the, first, invasion, was, for, sake, because, qing, was, at, war, between, ming, so, ming, s, alliance, with, joseon, was, threatening, and, the, second, invasion, was, for, joseon, to, obey, qing, after, that, qing, defeated, ming, and, took, the, whole, chinese, territories, joseon, also, had, to, obey, qing, because, joseon, lose, the, second, war, against, qing, after, the, qing, invasion, the, princes, of, the, joseon, dynasty, lived, their, childhood, in, china, the, son, of, king, injo, met, adam, schall, in, beijing, so, he, wanted, to, introduce, western, technologies, to, korean, people, when, he, becomes, a, king, he, died, before, he, could, take, the, throne, after, then, the, alternative, prince, became, the, 17th, king, of, the, joseon, dynasty, hyojong, trying, to, revenge, for, his, kingdom, and, fallen, ming, dynasty, to, qing, later, kings, such, as, yeongjo, and, jeongjo, tried, to, improve, their, people, s, lives, and, stop, the, governors, unreasonable, competition, from, the, 17th, century, to, the, 18th, century, joseon, sent, diplomats, and, artists, to, japan, more, than, 10, times, this, group, was, called, tongshinsa, they, were, sent, to, japan, to, teach, japan, about, advanced, korean, culture, japanese, people, liked, to, receive, poems, from, korean, nobles, at, that, time, korea, was, more, powerful, than, japan, but, that, relationship, between, joseon, and, japan, was, reversed, after, the, 19th, century, because, japan, became, more, powerful, than, korea, and, china, either, so, joseon, sent, diplomats, called, sooshinsa, to, learn, japanese, advanced, technologies, after, king, jeongjo, s, death, some, noble, families, controlled, the, whole, kingdom, in, the, early, 19th, century, at, the, end, of, that, period, western, people, invaded, joseon, in, 1876, joseon, was, set, free, from, qing, so, they, did, not, have, to, obey, qing, but, japanese, empire, was, happy, because, joseon, became, a, perfect, independent, kingdom, so, japan, could, intervene, in, the, kingdom, more, after, this, joseon, traded, with, the, united, states, and, sent, sooshinsa, to, japan, youngshinsa, to, qing, and, bobingsa, to, the, us, and, europe, these, groups, took, many, modern, things, to, the, korean, peninsula, in, early, modern, japan, following, the, sengoku, period, of, warring, states, central, government, had, been, largely, reestablished, by, oda, nobunaga, and, toyotomi, hideyoshi, during, the, azuchi, momoyama, period, after, the, battle, of, sekigahara, in, 1600, central, authority, fell, to, tokugawa, ieyasu, who, completed, this, process, and, received, the, title, of, sh, gun, in, 1603, society, in, the, japanese, tokugawa, period, see, edo, society, unlike, the, shogunates, before, it, was, based, on, the, strict, class, hierarchy, originally, established, by, toyotomi, hideyoshi, the, daimy, s, feudal, lords, were, at, the, top, followed, by, the, warrior, caste, of, samurai, with, the, farmers, artisans, and, merchants, ranking, below, the, country, was, strictly, closed, to, foreigners, with, few, exceptions, with, the, sakoku, policy, literacy, rose, in, the, two, centuries, of, isolation, in, some, parts, of, the, country, particularly, smaller, regions, daimy, s, and, samurai, were, more, or, less, identical, since, daimy, s, might, be, trained, as, samurai, and, samurai, might, act, as, local, lords, otherwise, the, largely, inflexible, nature, of, this, social, stratification, system, unleashed, disruptive, forces, over, time, taxes, on, the, peasantry, were, set, at, fixed, amounts, which, did, not, account, for, inflation, or, other, changes, in, monetary, value, as, a, result, the, tax, revenues, collected, by, the, samurai, landowners, were, worth, less, and, less, over, time, this, often, led, to, numerous, confrontations, between, noble, but, impoverished, samurai, and, well, to, do, peasants, none, however, proved, compelling, enough, to, seriously, challenge, the, established, order, until, the, arrival, of, foreign, powers, in, the, indian, subcontinent, the, mughal, empire, ruled, most, of, india, in, the, early, 18th, century, during, emperor, shah, jahan, and, his, son, aurangzeb, s, islamic, sharia, reigns, the, empire, reached, its, architectural, and, economic, zenith, and, became, the, world, s, largest, economy, worth, over, 25, of, world, gdp, in, the, mid, 18th, century, it, was, a, major, proto, industrializing, region, following, major, events, such, as, the, nader, shah, s, invasion, of, the, mughal, empire, battle, of, plassey, battle, of, buxar, and, the, long, anglo, mysore, wars, most, of, south, asia, was, colonised, and, governed, by, the, british, empire, thus, establishing, the, british, raj, the, classic, period, ended, with, the, death, of, mughal, emperor, aurangzeb, although, the, dynasty, continued, for, another, 150, years, during, this, period, the, empire, was, marked, by, a, highly, centralized, administration, connecting, the, different, regions, all, the, significant, monuments, of, the, mughals, their, most, visible, legacy, date, to, this, period, which, was, characterised, by, the, expansion, of, persian, cultural, influence, in, the, indian, subcontinent, with, brilliant, literary, artistic, and, architectural, results, the, maratha, empire, was, located, in, the, south, west, of, present, day, india, and, expanded, greatly, under, the, rule, of, the, peshwas, the, prime, ministers, of, the, maratha, empire, in, 1761, the, maratha, army, lost, the, third, battle, of, panipat, against, ahmad, shah, durrani, king, of, afghanistan, which, halted, imperial, expansion, and, the, empire, was, then, divided, into, a, confederacy, of, maratha, states, the, european, economic, and, naval, powers, pushed, into, asia, first, to, do, trading, and, then, to, take, over, major, colonies, the, dutch, led, the, way, followed, by, the, british, portugal, had, arrived, first, but, was, too, weak, to, maintain, its, small, holdings, and, was, largely, pushed, out, retaining, only, goa, and, macau, the, british, set, up, a, private, organization, the, east, india, company, which, handled, both, trade, and, imperial, control, of, much, of, india, the, commercial, colonization, of, india, commenced, in, 1757, after, the, battle, of, plassey, when, the, nawab, of, bengal, surrendered, his, dominions, to, the, british, east, india, company, in, 1765, when, the, company, was, granted, the, diwani, or, the, right, to, collect, revenue, in, bengal, and, bihar, or, in, 1772, when, the, company, established, a, capital, in, calcutta, appointed, its, first, governor, general, warren, hastings, and, became, directly, involved, in, governance, the, maratha, states, following, the, anglo, maratha, wars, eventually, lost, to, the, british, east, india, company, in, 1818, with, the, third, anglo, maratha, war, the, rule, lasted, until, 1858, when, after, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, and, consequent, of, the, government, of, india, act, 1858, the, british, government, assumed, the, task, of, directly, administering, india, in, the, new, british, raj, in, 1819, stamford, raffles, established, singapore, as, a, key, trading, post, for, britain, in, their, rivalry, with, the, dutch, however, their, rivalry, cooled, in, 1824, when, an, anglo, dutch, treaty, demarcated, their, respective, interests, in, southeast, asia, from, the, 1850s, onwards, the, pace, of, colonization, shifted, to, a, significantly, higher, gear, the, dutch, east, india, company, 1800, and, british, east, india, company, 1858, were, dissolved, by, their, respective, governments, who, took, over, the, direct, administration, of, the, colonies, only, thailand, was, spared, the, experience, of, foreign, rule, although, thailand, itself, was, also, greatly, affected, by, the, power, politics, of, the, western, powers, colonial, rule, had, a, profound, effect, on, southeast, asia, while, the, colonial, powers, profited, much, from, the, region, s, vast, resources, and, large, market, colonial, rule, did, develop, the, region, to, a, varying, extent, the, great, game, was, a, political, and, diplomatic, confrontation, between, great, britain, and, russia, over, afghanistan, and, neighbouring, territories, in, central, and, south, asia, it, lasted, from, 1828, to, 1907, there, was, no, war, but, there, were, many, threats, russia, was, fearful, of, british, commercial, and, military, inroads, into, central, asia, and, britain, was, fearful, of, russia, threatening, its, largest, and, most, important, possession, india, this, resulted, in, an, atmosphere, of, distrust, and, the, constant, threat, of, war, between, the, two, empires, britain, made, it, a, high, priority, to, protect, all, the, approaches, to, india, and, the, great, game, is, primarily, how, the, british, did, this, in, terms, of, a, possible, russian, threat, historians, with, access, to, the, archives, have, concluded, that, russia, had, no, plans, involving, india, as, the, russians, repeatedly, stated, the, great, game, began, in, 1838, when, britain, decided, to, gain, control, over, the, emirate, of, afghanistan, and, make, it, a, protectorate, and, to, use, the, ottoman, empire, the, persian, empire, the, khanate, of, khiva, and, the, emirate, of, bukhara, as, buffer, states, between, both, empires, this, would, protect, india, and, also, key, british, sea, trade, routes, by, stopping, russia, from, gaining, a, port, on, the, persian, gulf, or, the, indian, ocean, russia, proposed, afghanistan, as, the, neutral, zone, and, the, final, result, was, diving, up, afghanistan, with, a, neutral, zone, in, the, middle, between, russian, areas, in, the, north, and, british, in, the, south, important, episodes, included, the, failed, first, anglo, afghan, war, of, 1838, the, first, anglo, sikh, war, of, 1845, the, second, anglo, sikh, war, of, 1848, the, second, anglo, afghan, war, of, 1878, and, the, annexation, of, kokand, by, russia, the, 1901, novel, kim, by, rudyard, kipling, made, the, term, popular, and, introduced, the, new, implication, of, great, power, rivalry, it, became, even, more, popular, after, the, 1979, advent, of, the, soviet, afghan, war, by, 1644, the, northern, manchu, people, had, conquered, ming, dynasty, and, established, a, foreign, dynasty, the, qing, dynasty, once, more, the, manchu, qing, emperors, especially, confucian, scholar, kangxi, remained, largely, conservative, retaining, the, bureaucracy, and, the, scholars, within, it, as, well, as, the, confucian, ideals, present, in, chinese, society, however, changes, in, the, economy, and, new, attempts, at, resolving, certain, issues, occurred, too, these, included, increased, trade, with, western, countries, that, brought, large, amounts, of, silver, into, the, chinese, economy, in, exchange, for, tea, porcelain, and, silk, textiles, this, allowed, for, a, new, merchant, class, the, compradors, to, develop, in, addition, repairs, were, done, on, existing, dikes, canals, roadways, and, irrigation, works, this, combined, with, the, lowering, of, taxes, and, government, assigned, labor, was, supposed, to, calm, peasant, unrest, however, the, qing, failed, to, control, the, growing, landlord, class, which, had, begun, to, exploit, the, peasantry, and, abuse, their, position, by, the, late, 18th, century, both, internal, and, external, issues, began, to, arise, in, qing, china, s, politics, society, and, economy, the, exam, system, with, which, scholars, were, assigned, into, the, bureaucracy, became, increasingly, corrupt, bribes, and, other, forms, of, cheating, allowed, for, inexperienced, and, inept, scholars, to, enter, the, bureaucracy, and, this, eventually, caused, rampant, neglect, of, the, peasantry, military, and, the, previously, mentioned, infrastructure, projects, poverty, and, banditry, steadily, rose, especially, in, rural, areas, and, mass, migrations, looking, for, work, throughout, china, occurred, the, perpetually, conservative, government, refused, to, make, reforms, that, could, resolve, these, issues, china, saw, its, status, reduced, by, what, it, perceived, as, parasitic, trade, with, westerners, originally, european, traders, were, at, a, disadvantage, because, the, chinese, cared, little, for, their, goods, while, european, demand, for, chinese, commodities, such, as, tea, and, porcelain, only, grew, in, order, to, tip, the, trade, imbalance, in, their, favor, british, merchants, began, to, sell, indian, opium, to, the, chinese, not, only, did, this, sap, chinese, bullion, reserves, it, also, led, to, widespread, drug, addiction, amongst, the, bureaucracy, and, society, in, general, a, ban, was, placed, on, opium, as, early, as, 1729, by, the, yongzheng, emperor, but, little, was, done, to, enforce, it, by, the, early, 19th, century, under, the, new, daoguang, emperor, the, government, began, serious, efforts, to, eradicate, opium, from, chinese, society, leading, this, endeavour, were, respected, scholar, officials, including, imperial, commissioner, lin, zexu, after, lin, destroyed, more, than, 20, 000, chests, of, opium, in, the, summer, of, 1839, europeans, demanded, compensation, for, what, they, saw, as, unwarranted, chinese,
