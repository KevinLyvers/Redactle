and, the, european, reformation, was, a, major, theological, movement, in, western, christianity, in, 16th, century, europe, that, posed, a, religious, and, political, challenge, to, the, papacy, and, the, authority, of, the, catholic, church, towards, the, end, of, the, renaissance, the, reformation, marked, the, beginning, of, protestantism, and, in, turn, resulted, in, a, major, schism, within, western, christianity, it, is, considered, one, of, the, events, that, signified, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, and, the, beginning, of, the, early, modern, period, in, europe, when, the, reformation, era, ended, is, disputed, among, modern, scholars, prior, to, martin, luther, and, other, protestant, reformers, there, were, earlier, reform, movements, within, western, christianity, the, protestant, reformation, however, is, usually, considered, to, have, started, on, 31, october, 1517, with, the, publication, of, the, ninety, five, theses, authored, by, martin, luther, over, three, years, later, on, 3, january, 1521, luther, was, excommunicated, by, pope, leo, x, on, 25, may, 1521, at, the, diet, of, worms, luther, was, condemned, by, the, holy, roman, empire, which, officially, banned, citizens, from, defending, or, propagating, luther, s, ideas, luther, survived, after, being, declared, an, outlaw, due, to, the, protection, of, elector, frederick, the, wise, the, spread, of, gutenberg, s, printing, press, provided, the, means, for, the, rapid, dissemination, of, religious, materials, in, the, vernacular, the, initial, movement, in, germany, diversified, and, nearby, other, reformers, such, as, huldrych, zwingli, and, john, calvin, with, different, theologies, arose, in, general, the, reformers, argued, that, salvation, in, christianity, was, a, completed, status, based, on, faith, in, jesus, alone, and, not, a, process, that, could, involve, good, works, as, in, the, catholic, view, protestantism, also, introduced, new, ecclesiology, the, counter, reformation, was, the, catholic, reform, efforts, initiated, in, response, to, the, protestant, reformation, and, its, causes, in, the, 16th, century, context, the, term, mainly, covers, four, major, movements, lutheranism, calvinism, the, radical, reformation, and, the, catholic, reformation, historian, john, bossy, criticized, the, term, reformation, for, wrongly, implying, that, bad, religion, was, giving, way, to, good, but, also, because, it, has, little, application, to, actual, social, behaviour, and, little, or, no, sensitivity, to, thought, feeling, or, culture, some, historians, have, also, suggested, a, persisting, erasmian, reformation, anglican, theologian, alister, mcgrath, explains, the, term, reformation, as, an, interpretative, category, a, way, of, mapping, out, a, slice, of, history, in, which, certain, ideas, attitudes, and, values, were, developed, explored, and, applied, those, who, write, of, the, protestant, reformation, exclude, the, early, modern, catholic, reform, movements, magisterial, reformation, has, a, narrower, sense, as, it, refers, only, to, mainstream, protestantism, primarily, lutheranism, and, calvinism, contrasting, it, with, more, radical, ideas, catholic, reformation, is, distinguished, by, the, historian, massimo, firpo, from, counter, reformation, in, his, view, catholic, reformation, was, centered, on, the, care, of, souls, episcopal, residence, the, renewal, of, the, clergy, together, with, the, charitable, and, educational, roles, of, the, new, religious, orders, whereas, counter, reformation, was, founded, upon, the, defence, of, orthodoxy, the, repression, of, dissent, the, reassertion, of, ecclesiastical, authority, from, the, late, 20th, century, historians, often, use, the, plural, of, the, term, writing, of, reformations, to, emphasize, that, the, reformation, was, not, a, uniform, and, coherent, historical, phenomenon, but, the, result, of, parallel, movements, several, aspects, of, the, reformation, such, as, the, reformation, of, arts, music, rituals, and, communities, are, frequently, presented, in, specialised, studies, the, historian, peter, marshall, emphasizes, that, the, call, for, reform, within, christianity, is, about, as, old, as, the, religion, itself, and, in, every, age, there, have, been, urgent, attempts, to, bring, it, about, charlemagne, employed, a, rhetoric, of, reform, medieval, examples, include, the, cluniac, reform, in, the, 10th, 11th, centuries, and, the, 11th, century, gregorian, reform, both, striving, against, lay, influence, over, church, affairs, when, demanding, a, church, reform, medieval, authors, mainly, adopted, a, conservative, and, utopian, approach, expressing, their, admiration, for, a, previous, golden, age, or, apostolic, age, when, the, church, had, allegedly, been, perfect, and, free, of, abuses, both, the, starting, and, ending, date, of, the, reformation, have, always, been, debated, the, most, commonly, used, starting, date, is, 31, october, 1517, the, day, when, the, german, theologian, martin, luther, d, 1546, allegedly, nailed, up, a, copy, of, his, disputation, paper, on, indulgences, and, papal, power, known, as, the, ninety, five, theses, to, the, door, of, the, castle, church, in, wittenberg, in, electoral, saxony, calvinist, historians, often, propose, that, the, reformation, started, when, the, swiss, priest, huldrych, zwingli, d, 1531, first, preached, against, abuses, in, the, church, in, 1516, the, end, date, of, the, reformation, is, even, more, disputed, with, 25, september, 1555, when, the, peace, of, augsburg, was, accepted, 23, may, 1618, and, 24, october, 1648, when, the, thirty, years, war, began, and, ended, respectively, being, the, most, commonly, mentioned, terminuses, the, reformation, has, always, been, presented, as, one, of, the, most, crucial, episodes, of, the, early, modern, period, or, even, regarded, as, the, event, separating, the, modern, era, from, the, middle, ages, the, term, protestant, though, initially, purely, political, in, nature, later, acquired, a, broader, sense, referring, to, a, member, of, any, western, church, that, subscribed, to, the, main, reformation, or, anti, catholic, principles, six, princes, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, rulers, of, fourteen, imperial, free, cities, who, issued, a, protest, or,

revolts, that, often, ended, with, a, compromise, the, constant, fear, of, unexpected, death, was, mirrored, by, popular, artistic, motifs, such, as, the, allegory, of, danse, macabre, dance, of, death, the, fear, also, contributed, to, the, growing, popularity, of, masses, for, the, dead, already, detectable, among, early, christians, these, ceremonies, indicated, a, widespread, belief, in, purgatory, a, transitory, state, for, souls, that, needed, purification, before, entering, heaven, fear, of, malevolent, magical, practice, was, also, growing, and, witch, hunts, intensified, from,

world, and, the, purgatory, to, sinners, from, an, allegedly, inexhaustible, treasury, of, merit, the, popes, also, granted, dispensations, to, institutions, or, individuals, exempting, them, from,

the, fate, of, both, the, saved, and, the, damned, justification, before, god, and, the, timing, of, grace, was, also, the, subject, of, controversy, many, theologians, such, as, scotus, ockham, and, gabriel, biel, d, 1495, 470, taught, that, god, established, rules, how, the, faithful, could, gain, divine, grace, other, theologians, such, as, rimini, and, hugolino, of, orvieto, d, 1374, proposed,

women, alike, to, preach, the, western, schism, reinforced, a, general, desire, for, church, reform, the, oxford, theologian, john, wycliffe, d, 1384, was, one, of, the, most, radical, critics, he, attacked, pilgrimages, the, veneration, of, saints, and, the, doctrine, of, transubstantiation, he, regarded, the, church, as, an, exclusive, community, of, those, chosen, by, god, to, salvation, and, argued, that, the, state, could, seize, the, corrupt, clerics, endowments, known, as, lollards, wycliffe, s, followers, rejected, clerical, celibacy, and, the, grant, of, indulgences, the, parliament, of, england, passed, a, law, against, heretics, but, lollard, communities, survived, the, purges, wycliffe, s, theology, had, a, marked, impact, on, the, prague, academic, jan, hus, d, 1415, he, delivered, popular, sermons, against, the, clerics, wealth, and, temporal, powers, for, which, he, was, summoned, to, the, council, of, constance, although, the, german, king, sigismund, of, luxemburg, r, 1410, 1437, had, granted, him, safe, conduct, hus, was, sentenced, to, death, for, heresy, and, burned, at, the, stake, on, 6, july, 1415, his, execution, led, to, a, nationwide, religious, movement, in, bohemia, and, the, papacy, called, for, a, series, of, crusades, against, hus, s, followers, the, moderate, hussites, mainly, czech, aristocrats, and, academics, were, known, as, utraquists, for, they, taught, that, the, eucharist, was, to, be, administered, sub, utraque, specie, in, both, kinds, to, the, laity, the, most, radical, hussites, called, taborites, after, their, new, town, of, t, bor, held, their, property, in, common, their, millenarianism, shocked, the, utraquists, who, destroyed, them, in, the, battle, of, lipany, in, 1434, by, this, time, the, remaining, catholic, communities, in, bohemia, were, almost, exclusively, german, speaking, the, lack, of, a, hussite, church, hierarchy, enabled, the, czech, aristocrats, and, urban, magistrates, to, assume, control, of, the, hussite, clergy, from, the, 1470s, the, radical, hussites, set, up, their, own, church, known, as, the, union, of, bohemian, brethren, they, rejected, the, separation, of, clergy, and, laity, and, condemned, all, forms, of, violence, and, oath, taking, marshall, writes, that, the, lollards, hussites, and, conciliarist, theologians, collectively, give, the, lie, to, any, suggestion, that, torpor, and, complacency, were, the, hallmarks, of, religious, life, in, the, century, before, martin, luther, historians, customarily, refer, to, wycliffe, and, hus, as, forerunners, of, the, reformation, the, two, reformers, emphasis, on, the, bible, is, often, regarded, as, an, early, example, of, one, of, the, basic, principles, of, the, reformation, the, idea, sola, scriptura, by, the, scriptures, alone, although, prominent, scholastic, theologians, were, also, convinced, that, scripture, interpreted, reasonably, and, in, accord, with, the, church, and, the, fathers, contained, all, knowledge, necessary, for, salvation, a, new, intellectual, movement, known, as, humanism, emerged, in, the, late, middle, ages, the, humanists, slogan, ad, fontes, back, to, the, sources, demonstrated, their, enthusiasm, for, classical, texts, and, textual, criticism, the, rise, of, the, ottoman, empire, led, to, the, mass, immigration, of, byzantine, scholars, to, western, europe, and, many, of, them, brought, manuscripts, previously, unknown, to, western, scholarship, this, led, to, the, rediscovery, of, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, plato, 347, 348, bc, plato, s, ideas, about, an, ultimate, reality, lying, beyond, visible, reality, posed, a, serious, challenge, to, scholastic, theologians, rigorous, definitions, textual, criticism, called, into, question, the, reliability, of, some, of, the, fundamental, texts, of, papal, privilege, humanist, scholars, like, nicholas, of, cusa, d, 1464, proved, that, one, of, the, basic, documents, of, papal, authority, the, allegedly, 4th, century, donation, of, constantine, was, a, medieval, forgery, new, religious, movements, promoted, the, deeper, involvement, of, laity, in, religious, practices, the, brethren, of, the, common, life, dissuaded, their, members, priestly, ordination, and, often, placed, their, houses, under, the, protection, of, urban, authorities, they, were, closely, associated,

the, scriptural, proof, texts, for, some, catholic, dogmas, the, necessity, of, a, church, reform, in, capite, et, membris, in, head, and, limbs, was, frequently, discussed, at, the, ecumenical, councils, from, the, late, 13th, century, however, most, stakeholders, popes, prelates, and, kings, preferred, the, status, quo, because, they, did, not, want, to, lose, privileges, or, revenues, the, system, of, papal, dispensations, was, a, principal, obstacle, to, the, implementation, of, reform, measures, as, the, holy, see, regularly, granted, immunities, to, those, who, did, not, want, to, execute, them, within, regular, clergy, the, so, called, congregations, of, strict, observance, spread, these, were, monastic, communities, that, returned, to, the, strict, interpretation, of, their,

institutions, such, as, cathedral, chapters, neither, could, they, exercise, authority, over, non, resident, clerics, who, had, received, their, benefice, from, the, papacy, on, the, eve, of, the, reformation, the, fifth, council, of, the, lateran, was, the, last, occasion, when, efforts, to, introduce, a, far, reaching, reform, from, above, could, have, achieved, but, it, was, dissolved, in, 1517, without, making, decisions, on, the, issues, that, would, soon, come, to, the, fore, pope, leo, x, r, 1513, 1521, decided, to, complete, the, construction, of, the, new, st, peter, s, basilica, in, rome, as, the, sale, of, certificates, of, indulgences, had, been, a, well, established, method, of, papal, fund, raising, he, announced, new, indulgences, in, the, papal, bull, sacrosanctis, in, 1515, on, the, advice, of, the, banker, jakob, fugger, d, 1525, he, appointed, the, pluralist, prelate, albert, of, brandenburg, d, 1545, to, supervise, the, sale, campaign, in, germany, the, dominican, friar, johann, tetzel, d, 1519, a, leading, figure, in, the, campaign, applied, unusually, aggressive, marketing, methods, a, slogan, attributed, to, him, famously, claimed, that, as, soon, as, the, coin, into, the, box, rings, a, soul, from, purgatory, to, heaven, springs, frederick, the, wise, prince, elector, of, saxony, r, 1486, 1525, forbade, the, campaign, because, the, sacrosanctis, suspended, the, sale, of, previous, indulgences, depriving, him, of, revenues, that, he, had, spent, on, his, collection, of, relics, the, campaign, s, vulgarity, shocked, many, serious, minded, believers, among, them, martin, luther, a, theology, professor, at, the, university, of, wittenberg, in, saxony, born, into, a, middle, class, family, luther, entered, an, augustinian, monastery, after, a, heavy, thunderstorm, dreadfully, reminded, him, the, risk, of, sudden, death, and, eternal, damnation, but, his, anxiety, about, his, sinfulness, did, not, abate, his, studies, on, the, works, of, the, late, roman, theologian, augustine, of, hippo, d, 430, convinced, him, that, those, whom, god, chose, as, his, elect, received, a, gift, of, faith, independently, of, their, acts, he, first, denounced, the, idea, of, justification, through, human, efforts, in, his, disputatio, contra, scholasticam, theologiam, disputation, against, scholastic, theology, in, september, 1517, on, 31, october, 1517, luther, addressed, a, letter, to, albert, of, brandenburg, stating, that, the, clerics, preaching, the, st, peter, s, indulgences, were, deceiving, the, faithful, and, attached, his, ninety, five, theses, to, it, he, questioned, the, efficacy, of, indulgences, for, the, dead, although, also, stated, if, indulgences, were, preached, according, to, the, spirit, and, intention, of, the, pope, all, doubts, would, be, readily, resolved, archbishop, albert, ordered, the, theologians, at, the, university, of, mainz, to, examine, the, document, tetzel, and, the, theologians, konrad, wimpina, d, 1531, and, johann, eck, d, 1543, were, the, first, to, associate, some, of, luther, s, propositions, with, hussitism, the, case, was, soon, forwarded, to, the, roman, curia, for, judgement, pope, leo, remained, uninterested, and, mentioned, the, case, as, a, quarrel, among, friars, christians, should, be, exhorted, to, seek, earnestly, to, follow, christ, their, head, through, penalties, deaths, hells, and, let, them, thus, be, more, confident, of, entering, heaven, through, many, tribulations, rather, than, through, a, false, assurance, of, peace, martin, luther, ninety, five, theses, as, the, historian, lyndal, roper, notes, the, reformation, proceeded, by, a, set, of, debates, and, arguments, luther, presented, his, views, in, public, at, the, observant, augustinians, assembly, in, heidelberg, on, 26, april, 1518, here, he, explained, his, theology, of, the, cross, about, a, loving, god, who, had, become, frail, to, save, fallen, humanity, contrasting, it, with, the, scholastic, theology, of, glory, that, in, his, view, celebrated, erudition, and, human, acts, it, is, uncertain, when, luther, s, concept, of, justification, by, faith, alone, a, central, element, of, his, theology, crystallised, he, would, later, attribute, it, to, his, tower, experience, when, he, comprehended, that, god, could, freely, declare, even, sinners, righteous, while, he, was, thinking, about, the, words, of, paul, the, apostle, d, 64, or, 65, the, just, shall, live, by, faith, urged, by, luther, s, opponents, pope, leo, appointed, the, jurist, girolamo, ghinucci, d, 1541, and, the, theologian, sylvester, mazzolini, d, 1527, to, inspect, luther, s, teaching, mazzolini, argued, that, luther, had, questioned, papal, authority, by, attacking, the, indulgences, while, luther, concluded, that, only, a, fundamental, reform, could, put, an, end, to, the, abuse, of, indulgences, pope, leo, did, not, excommunicate, luther, because, leo, did, not, want, to, alienate, luther, s, patron, frederick, the, wise, instead, he, appointed, cardinal, thomas, cajetan, d, 1534, to, convince, luther, to, withdraw, some, of, his, theses, cajetan, met, with, luther, at, augsburg, in, october, 1518, the, historian, berndt, hamm, says, that, the, meeting, was, the, historical, point, at, which, the, opposition, between, the, reformation, and, catholicism, first, emerged, as, cajetan, thought, that, believers, accepting, luther, s, views, of, justification, would, no, more, obey, clerical, guidance, luther, first, expressed, his, sympathy, for, jan, hus, at, a, disputation, in, leipzig, in, june, 1519, his, case, was, reopened, at, the, roman, curia, cajetan, eck, and, other, papal, officials, drafted, the, papal, bull, exsurge, domine, arise, o, lord, which, was, published, on, 15, june, 1520, it, condemned, luther, s, forty, one, theses, and, offered, a, sixty, day, long, grace, period, to, him, to, recant, luther, s, theology, quickly, developed, in, a, latin, treatise, on, the, babylonian, captivity, of, the, church, he, stated, that, only, baptism, and, the, eucharist, could, be, regarded, as, sacraments, and, priests, were, not, members, of, a, privileged, class, but, servants, of, the, community, hence, they, became, called, ministers, from, the, latin, word, for, servant, his, german, manifesto, to, the, christian, nobility, of, the, german, nation, associated, the, papacy, with, the, antichrist, and, described, the, holy, see, as, the, worst, whorehouse, of, all, whorehouses, in, reference, to, the, funds, flowing, to, the, roman, curia, it, also, challenged, the, biblical, justification, of, clerical, celibacy, luther, s, study, on, the, freedom, of, a, christian, consolidated, his, thoughts, about, the, believers, inner, freedom, with, their, obligation, to, care, for, their, neighbours, although, he, rejected, the, traditional, teaching, about, good, works, the, study, is, a, characteristic, example, of, luther, s, enthusiasm, for, paradoxes, the, papal, nuncio, girolamo, aleandro, d, 1542, ordered, the, burning, of, luther, s, books, in, response, luther, and, his, followers, burned, the, papal, bull, along, with, a, copy, of, the, corpus, juris, canonici, the, fundamental, document, of, medieval, ecclesiastic, law, at, wittenberg, the, papal, bull, excommunicating, luther, was, published, on, 3, january, 1521, the, newly, elected, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, r, 1519, 1556, wanted, to, outlaw, luther, at, the, diet, of, worms, but, could, not, make, the, decision, alone, the, holy, roman, empire, was, a, confederation, of, autonomous, states, and, authority, rested, with, the, imperial, diets, where, the, imperial, estates, assembled, frederick, the, wise, vetoed, the, imperial, ban, against, luther, and, luther, was, summoned, to, worms, to, defend, his, case, at, the, diet, in, april, 1521, here, he, refused, to, recant, stating, that, only, arguments, from, the, bible, could, convince, him, that, his, works, contained, errors, after, luther, and, his, supporters, left, the, diet, those, who, remained, sanctioned, the, imperial, ban, threatening, luther, s, supporters, with, imprisonment, and, confiscation, of, their, property, to, save, luther, s, life, but, also, to, hide, his, involvement, frederick, arranged, luther, s, abduction, on, 4, may, during, his, ten, month, long, staged, captivity, at, frederick, s, castle, of, wartburg, luther, translated, the, new, testament, to, high, german, the, historian, diarmaid, macculloch, describes, the, translation, as, an, extraordinary, achievement, that, has, shaped, the, german, language, ever, since, adding, that, luther, s, gift, was, for, seizing, the, emotion, with, sudden, urgent, phrases, the, translation, would, be, published, at, the, 1522, leipzig, book, fair, along, with, luther, s, treatise, on, monastic, vows, that, laid, the, theological, foundations, of, the, dissolution, of, monasteries, luther, also, composed, religious, hymns, in, wartburg, they, would, be, first, published, in, collections, in, 1524, during, luther, s, absence, his, co, workers, primarily, philip, melanchthon, d, 1560, and, andreas, karlstadt, d, 1541, assumed, the, leadership, of, reformation, in, wittenberg, melanchthon, consolidated, luther, s, thoughts, into, a, coherent, theological, work, titled, loci, communes, common, places, roper, argues, that, the, most, important, reason, why, luther, did, not, meet, with, hus, s, fate, was, technology, the, new, medium, of, print, luther, was, publishing, his, views, in, short, but, pungent, treatises, that, gained, unexpected, popularity, he, was, responsible, for, about, one, fifth, of, all, works, printed, in, germany, in, the, first, third, of, the, 16th, century, german, printing, presses, were, scattered, in, many, urban, centers, which, prevented, their, control, by, central, authorities, statistical, analysis, indicates, a, significant, correlation, between, the, presence, of, a, printing, press, in, a, german, city, and, the, adoption, of, reformation, reformation, spread, through, the, activities, of, enthusiastic, preachers, such, as, johannes, oecolampadius, d, 1531, and, konrad, k, rsner, d, 1556, in, basel, sebastian, hofmeister, d, 1533, in, schaffhausen, and, matth, us, zell, d, 1548, and, martin, bucer, d, 1551, in, strasbourg, they, were, called, evangelicals, due, to, their, insistence, on, teaching, in, accordance, with, the, gospels, or, evangelion, luther, and, many, of, his, followers, worked, with, the, artist, lucas, cranach, the, elder, d, 1553, who, had, a, keen, sense, of, visualising, their, message, he, produced, luther, s, idealised, portrait, setting, a, template, for, further, popular, images, printed, on, the, covers, of, books, cranach, s, woodcuts, together, with, itinerant, preachers, explanations, helped, the, mainly, illiterate, people, to, understand, luther, s, teaching, the, illustrated, pamphlets, were, carried, from, place, to, place, typically, by, peddlers, and, merchants, laypeople, started, to, discuss, various, aspects, of, religion, in, both, private, and, public, all, over, germany, the, self, governing, free, imperial, cities, were, the, first, centers, of, the, reformation, the, evangelical, preachers, emphasized, that, many, of, the, well, established, church, practices, had, no, precedent, in, the, bible, they, offered, the, eucharist, to, the, laity, in, both, kinds, and, denied, the, clerics, monopolies, which, resonated, with, popular, anti, clericalism, it, was, not, unusual, that, their, supporters, attacked, clerics, and, church, buildings, violent, iconoclasm, was, common, in, some, cities, such, as, strasbourg, and, ulm, the, urban, magistrates, supported, the, reformation, in, the, cities, of, the, hanseatic, league, the, affluent, middle, classes, enforced, changes, in, church, life, cities, located, closer, to, the, most, important, ideological, centers, of, the, reformation, wittenberg, and, basel, adopted, its, ideas, more, likely, than, other, towns, this, indicates, the, significance, either, of, student, networks, or, of, neighbours, who, had, rejected, catholicism, the, sociologist, steven, pfaff, underlines, that, ecclesiastical, and, liturgical, reform, was, not, simply, a, religious, question, since, the, sort, of, reforms, demanded, by, evangelicals, could, not, be, accommodated, within, existing, institutions, prevailing, customs, or, established, law, after, their, triumph, the, reformers, expelled, their, leading, opponents, dissolved, the, monasteries, and, convents, secured, the, urban, magistrates, control, of, the, appointment, of, priests, and, established, new, civic, institutions, evangelical, town, councils, usually, prohibited, begging, but, established, a, common, chest, for, poverty, relief, by, expropriating, the, property, of, dissolved, ecclesiastic, institutions, the, funds, were, used, for, the, daily, support, of, orphans, old, people, and, the, sick, but, also, for, low, interest, loans, to, the, impoverished, to, start, a, business, luther, was, convinced, that, only, educated, people, could, effectively, serve, both, god, and, the, community, under, his, auspices, public, schools, and, libraries, were, opened, in, many, towns, offering, education, to, more, children, than, the, traditional, monastic, and, cathedral, schools, resistance, to, evangelical, preaching, was, significant, in, flanders, the, rhineland, bavaria, and, austria, here, the, veneration, of, local, saints, was, strong, and, statistical, analysis, indicates, that, cities, where, indigenous, saints, shrines, served, as, centers, of, vivid, communal, cults, less, likely, adopted, reformation, likewise, cities, with, an, episcopal, see, or, monasteries, more, likely, resisted, evangelical, proselytism, luther, s, ideas, were, rejected, by, most, representatives, of, the, previous, generation, of, humanists, erasmus, stated, that, luther, s, unrestrained, enthusiasm, carries, him, beyond, what, is, right, jacob, van, hoogstraaten, d, 1527, compared, luther, s, theology, of, salvation, as, if, christ, takes, to, himself, the, most, foul, bride, and, is, unconcerned, about, her, cleanliness, luther, s, works, were, burned, in, most, european, countries, emperor, charles, initiated, the, execution, of, the, first, evangelical, martyrs, the, augustinian, monks, jan, van, essen, and, hendrik, vos, they, were, burned, in, brussels, on, 1, july, 1523, charles, was, determined, to, protect, the, catholic, church, but, the, ottoman, turks, expansion, towards, central, europe, often, thwarted, him, the, english, king, henry, viii, r, 1509, 1547, commissioned, a, team, of, theologians, to, defend, the, catholic, dogmas, against, luther, s, attacks, their, treatise, titled, the, assertion, of, the, seven, sacraments, was, published, under, henry, s, name, and, the, grateful, pope, awarded, him, with, the, title, defender, of, the, faith, in, scotland, the, first, evangelical, preacher, patrick, hamilton, d, 1528, was, burned, for, heresy, in, france, the, theologians, of, the, sorbonne, stated, that, luther, vomited, up, a, doctrine, of, pestilence, guillaume, bri, onnet, d, 1534, bishop, of, meaux, also, condemned, luther, but, employed, reform, minded, clerics, like, jacques, lef, vre, d, taples, d, c, 1536, and, william, farel, d, 1565, to, renew, religious, life, in, his, diocese, they, enjoyed, the, protection, of, marguerite, of, angoul, me, d, 1549, the, well, educated, sister, of, the, french, king, francis, i, r, 1515, 1547, the, parlement, of, paris, only, took, actions, against, them, after, francis, was, captured, in, the, battle, of, pavia, in, 1525, forcing, many, of, them, into, exile, the, spanish, inquisition, prevented, the, spread, of, evangelical, literature, in, that, country, and, suppressed, the, spiritual, movement, of, the, alumbrados, illuminists, who, put, a, special, emphasis, on, personal, faith, some, italian, men, of, letters, such, as, the, venetian, nobleman, gasparo, contarini, d, 1542, and, the, augustinian, friar, peter, martyr, vermigli, d, 1562, expressed, ideas, resembling, luther, s, theology, of, salvation, but, did, not, break, with, catholicism, they, were, known, as, spirituali, correspondence, between, luke, of, prague, d, 1528, leader, of, the, bohemian, brethren, and, luther, made, it, clear, that, their, theologies, were, incompatible, even, if, their, views, about, justification, were, similar, in, bohemia, hungary, and, poland, luther, s, theology, spread,

infant, baptism, luther, defended, art, as, a, proof, of, the, beauty, of, the, creation, maintained, that, christ, s, body, and, blood, were, physically, present, in, the, eucharist, and, regarded, infant, baptism, as, a, sign, of, membership, in, the, christian, community, to, put, an, end, to, the, anarchy, frederick, the, wise, released, luther, in, march, 1522, luther, achieved, the, zwickau, prophets, removal, from, wittenberg, calling, them, fanatics, karlstadt, voluntarily, left, wittenberg, for, orlam, nde, where, the, local, congregation, elected, him, its, minister, luther, visited, most, parishes, in, the, region, to, prevent, radical, reforms, but, he, was, often, received, by, verbal, or, physical, abuses, when, he, wanted, to, dismiss, karlstadt, the, parishioners,

regarded, the, eucharist, as, a, commemorative, ceremony, in, honor, of, the, crucified, jesus, the, disagreement, caused, a, bitter, pamphlet, war, between, luther, and, zwingli, they, both, rejected, intermediary, eucharistic, formulas, coined, by, bucer, zwingli, s, cautious, magisterial, reformation, outraged, the, more, radical, reformers, among, them, conrad, grebel, d, 1526, a, z,

and, theologians, of, the, 16th, century, especially, luther, calvin, and, zwingli, their, ideas, were, studied, in, depth, however, the, rise, of, the, new, social, history, in, the, 1960s, led, to, looking, at, history, from, the, bottom, up, not, from, the, top, down, historians, began, to, concentrate, on, the, values, beliefs, and, behavior, of, the, people, at, large, she, finds, in, contemporary, scholarship, the, reformation, is, now, seen, as, a, vast, cultural, upheaval, a, social, and, popular, movement, textured, and, rich, because, of, its, diversity, for, example, historian, john, bossy, characterized, the, reformation, as, a, period, where, christianity, was, re, cast, not, as, a, community, sustained, by, ritual, acts, but, as, a, teaching, enforced, by, institutional, structures, for, catholics, as, well, as, protestants, and, sin, was, re, cast, from, the, seven, deadly, sins, wrong, because, antisocial, to, transgressions, of, the, ten, commandments, wrong, as, affronts, to, god, painting, and, sculpture, building, literature, musical, forms, liturgies, hymnals, secular, music, partly, due, to, martin, luther, s, love, for, music, music, became, important, in, lutheranism, the, study, and, practice, of, music, was, encouraged, in, protestant, majority, countries, songs, such, as, the, lutheran, hymns, or, the, calvinist, psalter, became, tools, for, the, spread, of, protestant, ideas, and, beliefs, as, well, as, identity, flags, similar, attitudes, developed, among, catholics, who, in, turn, encouraged, the, creation, and, use, of, music, for, religious, purposes
