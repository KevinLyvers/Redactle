the, history, of, peru, spans, 15, millennia, extending, back, through, several, stages, of, cultural, development, along, the, country, s, desert, coastline, and, in, the, andes, mountains, peru, s, coast, was, home, to, the, norte, chico, civilization, the, oldest, civilization, in, the, americas, and, one, of, the, six, cradles, of, civilization, in, the, world, when, the, spanish, arrived, in, the, sixteenth, century, peru, was, the, homeland, of, the, highland, inca, empire, the, largest, and, most, advanced, state, in, pre, columbian, america, after, the, conquest, of, the, incas, the, spanish, empire, established, a, viceroyalty, with, jurisdiction, over, most, of, its, south, american, domains, peru, declared, independence, from, spain, in, 1821, but, achieved, independence, only, after, the, battle, of, ayacucho, three, years, later, modern, historiography, of, peru, divides, its, history, into, three, main, periods, hunting, tools, dating, back, to, more, than, 11, 000, years, ago, have, been, found, inside, the, caves, of, pachacamac, telarmachay, junin, and, lauricocha, some, of, the, oldest, civilizations, appeared, circa, 6000, bc, in, the, coastal, provinces, of, chilca, and, paracas, and, in, the, highland, province, of, callej, n, de, huaylas, over, the, next, three, thousand, years, inhabitants, switched, from, nomadic, lifestyles, to, cultivating, land, as, evidenced, from, sites, such, as, jiskairumoko, kotosh, and, huaca, prieta, cultivation, of, plants, such, as, corn, and, cotton, gossypium, barbadense, began, as, well, as, the, domestication, of, animals, such, as, the, wild, ancestors, of, the, llama, the, alpaca, and, the, guinea, pig, as, seen, in, the, 6000, bc, dated, camelid, relief, paintings, in, the, mollepunko, caves, in, callalli, inhabitants, practiced, spinning, and, knitting, of, cotton, and, wool, basketry, and, pottery, as, these, inhabitants, became, sedentary, farming, allowed, them, to, build, settlements, as, a, result, new, societies, emerged, along, the, coast, and, in, the, andean, mountains, the, first, known, city, in, the, americas, was, caral, located, in, the, supe, valley, 200, km, north, of, lima, it, was, built, in, approximately, 2500, bc, the, remnants, of, this, civilization, also, known, as, norte, chico, consists, of, approximately, 30, pyramidal, structures, built, up, in, receding, terraces, ending, in, a, flat, roof, some, of, them, measuring, up, to, 20, meters, in, height, caral, is, regarded, as, one, of, several, cradles, of, civilization, around, the, world, where, civilization, emerged, independent, of, other, civilizations, in, the, early, 21st, century, archeologists, discovered, new, evidence, of, ancient, pre, ceramic, complex, cultures, three, irrigation, canals, that, were, 5400, years, old, and, a, possible, fourth, that, was, 6700, years, old, in, the, za, a, valley, in, northern, peru, this, was, the, evidence, of, community, agricultural, improvements, that, occurred, at, a, much, earlier, date, than, previously, believed, in, 2006, a, research, team, discovered, a, 4200, year, old, observatory, at, buena, vista, a, site, in, the, andes, several, kilometers, north, of, present, day, lima, they, believe, the, observatory, was, related, to, the, society, s, reliance, on, agriculture, and, understanding, of, the, seasons, the, site, includes, the, oldest, three, dimensional, sculptures, found, thus, far, in, south, america, in, 2007, the, archaeologist, walter, alva, and, his, team, found, a, 4000, year, old, temple, with, painted, murals, at, ventarr, n, in, the, northwest, lambayeque, region, the, temple, contained, ceremonial, offerings, gained, from, an, exchange, with, peruvian, jungle, societies, as, well, as, those, from, the, ecuador, a, coast, such, finds, show, sophisticated, monumental, construction, requiring, large, scale, organization, of, labor, suggesting, that, hierarchical, complex, cultures, arose, in, south, america, much, earlier, than, previously, thought, many, other, civilizations, developed, and, were, absorbed, by, the, most, powerful, ones, such, as, kotosh, chavin, paracas, lima, nasca, moche, tiwanaku, wari, lambayeque, chimu, and, chincha, among, others, the, paracas, culture, emerged, on, the, southern, coast, around, 300, bc, they, are, known, for, their, use, of, vicu, a, fibers, instead, of, just, cotton, to, produce, fine, textiles, innovations, that, did, not, reach, the, northern, coast, of, peru, until, centuries, later, coastal, cultures, such, as, the, moche, and, nazca, flourished, from, about, 100, bc, to, about, ad, 700, the, moche, produced, impressive, metalwork, as, well, as, some, of, the, finest, pottery, seen, in, the, ancient, world, while, the, nazca, are, known, for, their, textiles, and, the, enigmatic, nazca, lines, these, coastal, cultures, eventually, began, to, decline, as, a, result, of, recurring, el, ni, o, floods, and, droughts, in, consequence, the, huari, and, tiwanaku, who, dwelt, inland, in, the, andes, became, the, predominant, cultures, of, the, region, encompassing, much, of, modern, day, peru, and, bolivia, they, were, succeeded, by, powerful, city, states, such, as, chancay, sip, n, and, cajamarca, and, two, empires, chimor, and, chachapoyas, these, cultures, developed, relatively, advanced, techniques, of, cultivation, gold, and, silver, craft, pottery, metallurgy, and, knitting, around, 700, bc, they, appear, to, have, developed, systems, of, social, organization, that, were, the, precursors, of, the, inca, civilization, in, the, highlands, both, the, tiahuanaco, culture, near, lake, titicaca, in, both, peru, and, bolivia, and, the, wari, culture, near, the, present, day, city, of, ayacucho, developed, large, urban, settlements, and, wide, ranging, state, systems, between, 500, and, 1000, ad, while, in, the, forested, region, of, the, amazon, architectural, excavations, from, the, chachapoya, and, the, wari, culture, allow, for, the, evidence, of, complex, societal, presences, prior, to, the, conquest, of, amazonas, region, by, the, incan, empire, as, the, incan, empire, expanded, it, defeated, and, assimilated, uncooperative, andean, cultures, like, the, chachapoyas, culture, archaeologists, revealed, the, largest, mass, child, sacrifice, with, more, than, 140, children, skeleton, and, 200, llamas, dating, to, the, chim, culture, children, s, faces, were, smeared, with, a, red, pigment, during, the, ceremony, before, their, chests, had, been, cut, open, most, likely, to, remove, their, hearts, remains, showed, that, these, kids, came, from, different, regions, and, when, the, children, and, llamas, were, sacrificed, the, area, was, drenched, with, water, in, september, 2021, archaeologists, announced, the, remains, of, eight, 800, year, old, bodies, nearby, ancient, town, of, chilca, bodies, included, adults, and, children, who, were, covered, in, plant, material, before, being, buried, some, dishes, and, musical, instruments, were, uncovered, as, well, researchers, think, remains, belong, to, the, chilca, culture, which,

international, attention, by, yale, archaeologist, hiram, bingham, iii, bingham, often, cited, as, the, inspiration, for, indiana, jones, scientifically, rediscovered, the, site, in, 1911, and, brought, international, attention, to, the, site, with, his, best, selling, book, lost, city, of, the, incas, however, agust, n, liz, rraga, already, reached, the, site, on, july, 14, 1902, and, left,

sold, to, the, current, owners, at, yale, university, an, alternative, history, is, provided, by, the, contemporary, writer, inca, garcilasco, de, la, vega, son, of, an, inca, princess, and, a, conquistador, he, says, the, name, bir, was, that, of, a, common, indian, happened, upon, by, the, crew, of, a, ship, on, an, exploratory, mission, for, governor, pedro, arias, de, vila, and, goes, on, to, relate, many, more, instances, of, misunderstandings, due, to, the, lack, of, a, common, language, the, spanish, crown, gave, the, name, legal, status, with, the, 1529, capitulaci, n, de, toledo, which, designated, the, newly, encountered, inca, empire, as, the, province, of, peru, under, spanish, rule, the, country, adopted, the, denomination, viceroyalty, of, peru, which, became, republic, of, peru, after, independence, when, the, spanish, landed, in, 1531, peru, s, territory, was, the, nucleus, of, the, highly, developed, inca, civilization, centered, at, cuzco, the, inca, empire, extended, over, a, vast, region, stretching, from, southwest, ecuador, to, northern, chile, francisco, pizarro, and, his, brothers, were, attracted, by, the, news, of, a, rich, and, fabulous, kingdom, in, 1532, they, arrived, in, the, country, which, they, called, peru, the, forms, biru, pir, and, ber, are, also, seen, in, early, records, according, to, ra, l, porras, barrenechea, peru, is, not, a, quechuan, nor, caribbean, word, but, indo, hispanic, or, hybrid, in, the, years, between, 1524, and, 1526, smallpox, introduced, from, the, conquistadors, in, panama, and, preceding, the, spanish, conquerors, in, peru, through, transmission, among, natives, had, swept, through, the, inca, empire, smallpox, caused, the, death, of, the, inca, ruler, huayna, capac, as, well, as, most, of, his, family, including, his, heir, caused, the, fall, of, the, inca, political, structure, and, contributed, to, the, civil, war, between, the, brothers, atahualpa, and, hu, scar, taking, advantage, of, this, pizarro, carried, out, a, coup, d, tat, on, 16, november, 1532, while, the, atahualpa, s, victorious, army, was, in, an, unarmed, celebration, in, cajamarca, the, spanish, lured, atahualpa, into, a, trap, during, the, battle, of, cajamarca, the, well, armed, 168, spaniards, killed, thousands, of, barely, armed, inca, soldiers, and, captured, the, newly, minted, inca, ruler, causing, a, great, consternation, among, the, natives, and, conditioning, the, future, course, of, the, fight, when, hu, scar, was, killed, the, spanish, tried, and, convicted, atahualpa, of, the, murder, executing, him, by, strangulation, for, a, period, pizarro, maintained, the, ostensible, authority, of, the, inca, recognizing, t, pac, huallpa, as, the, sapa, inca, after, atahualpa, s, death, but, the, conqueror, s, abuses, made, this, facade, too, obvious, spanish, domination, consolidated, itself, as, successive, indigenous, rebellions, were, bloodily, repressed, by, 23, march, 1534, pizarro, and, the, spanish, had, re, founded, the, inca, city, of, cuzco, as, a, new, spanish, colonial, settlement, establishing, a, stable, colonial, government, was, delayed, for, some, time, by, native, revolts, and, bands, of, the, conquistadores, led, by, pizarro, and, diego, de, almagro, fighting, among, themselves, a, long, civil, war, developed, from, which, pizarro, emerged, victorious, at, the, battle, of, las, salinas, in, 1541, pizarro, was, assassinated, by, a, faction, led, by, diego, de, almagro, ii, el, mozo, and, the, stability, of, the, original, colonial, regime, was, shaken, up, in, the, ensuing, civil, war, despite, this, the, spaniards, did, not, neglect, the, colonizing, process, its, most, significant, milestone, was, the, foundation, of, lima, in, january, 1535, from, which, the, political, and, administrative, institutions, were, organized, the, new, rulers, instituted, the, encomienda, system, by, which, the, spanish, extracted, tribute, from, the, local, population, part, of, which, was, forwarded, to, seville, in, return, for, converting, the, natives, to, christianity, title, to, the, land, itself, remained, with, the, king, of, spain, as, governor, of, peru, pizarro, used, the, encomienda, system, to, grant, virtually, unlimited, authority, over, groups, of, native, peruvians, to, his, soldier, companions, thus, forming, the, colonial, land, tenure, structure, the, indigenous, inhabitants, of, peru, were, now, expected, to, raise, old, world, cattle, poultry, and, crops, for, their, landlords, resistance, was, punished, severely, giving, rise, to, the, black, legend, the, necessity, of, consolidating, spanish, royal, authority, over, these, territories, led, to, the, creation, of, a, real, audiencia, royal, audience, in, 1542, or, 1543, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, virreinato, del, per, was, established, with, authority, over, most, of, spanish, ruled, south, america, colombia, ecuador, panam, after, 1571, and, venezuela, were, split, off, as, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, virreinato, de, nueva, granada, in, 1717, and, argentina, bolivia, paraguay, and, uruguay, were, set, up, as, the, viceroyalty, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, in, 1776, after, pizarro, s, death, there, were, numerous, internal, problems, and, spain, finally, sent, blasco, n, ez, vela, to, be, peru, s, first, viceroy, in, 1544, he, was, later, killed, by, pizarro, s, brother, gonzalo, pizarro, but, a, new, viceroy, pedro, de, la, gasca, eventually, managed, to, restore, order, he, captured, and, executed, gonzalo, pizarro, a, census, taken, by, the, last, quipucamayoc, indicated, that, there, were, 12, million, inhabitants, of, inca, peru, 45, years, later, under, viceroy, toledo, the, census, figures, amounted, to, only, 1, 100, 000, inca, historian, david, n, cook, estimates, that, their, population, decreased, from, an, estimated, 9, million, in, the, 1520s, to, around, 600, 000, in, 1620, mainly, because, of, infectious, diseases, while, the, attrition, was, not, an, organized, attempt, at, genocide, the, results, were, similar, scholars, now, believe, that, among, the, various, contributing, factors, epidemic, disease, such, as, smallpox, unlike, the, spanish, the, amerindians, had, no, immunity, to, the, disease, was, the, overwhelming, cause, of, the, population, decline, of, the, american, natives, inca, cities, were, given, spanish, christian, names, and, rebuilt, as, spanish, towns, centered, around, a, plaza, with, a, church, or, cathedral, facing, an, official, residence, a, few, inca, cities, like, cuzco, retained, native, masonry, for, the, foundations, of, their, walls, other, inca, sites, like, huanuco, viejo, were, abandoned, for, cities, at, lower, altitudes, more, hospitable, to, the, spanish, in, 1542, the, spanish, crown, created, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, which, was, reorganized, after, the, arrival, of, viceroy, francisco, de, toledo, in, 1572, he, put, an, end, to, the, indigenous, neo, inca, state, in, vilcabamba, and, executed, tupac, amaru, i, he, also, sought, economic, development, through, commercial, monopoly, and, mineral, extraction, mainly, from, the, silver, mines, of, potos, he, reused, the, inca, mita, a, forced, labor, program, to, mobilize, native, communities, for, mining, work, this, organization, transformed, peru, into, the, principal, source, of, spanish, wealth, and, power, in, south, america, the, town, of, lima, founded, by, pizarro, on, 18, january, 1535, as, the, ciudad, de, reyes, city, of, kings, became, the, seat, of, the, new, viceroyalty, it, grew, into, a, powerful, city, with, jurisdiction, over, most, of, spanish, south, america, precious, metals, passed, through, lima, on, their, way, to, the, isthmus, of, panama, and, from, there, to, seville, spain, for, the, atlantic, route, for, the, pacific, it, passed, to, mexico, and, disembarked, from, the, port, of, acapulco, and, eventually, arrived, at, the, philippines, by, the, 18th, century, lima, had, become, a, distinguished, and, aristocratic, colonial, capital, seat, of, a, university, and, the, chief, spanish, stronghold, in, the, americas, peru, was, thus, wealthy, and, highly, populated, sebastian, hurtado, de, corcuera, governor, of, panama, settled, zamboanga, city, in, the, philippines, where, residents, now, speak, a, spanish, creole, by, employing, soldiers, and, colonists, recruited, from, the, towns, of, peru, nevertheless, throughout, the, eighteenth, century, further, away, from, lima, in, the, provinces, the, spanish, did, not, have, complete, control, the, spanish, could, not, govern, the, provinces, without, the, help, of, local, elite, this, local, elite, who, governed, under, the, title, of, curaca, took, pride, in, their, incan, history, additionally, throughout, the, eighteenth, century, indigenous, people, rebelled, against, the, spanish, two, of, the, most, important, rebellions, were, that, of, juan, santos, atahualpa, in, 1742, in, the, andean, jungle, provinces, of, tarma, and, jauja, which, expelled, the, spanish, from, a, large, area, and, the, rebellion, of, t, pac, amaru, ii, in, 1780, around, the, highlands, near, cuzco, at, the, time, an, economic, crisis, was, developing, due, to, creation, of, the, viceroyalties, of, new, granada, and, rio, de, la, plata, at, the, expense, of, its, territory, the, duty, exemptions, that, moved, the, commercial, center, from, lima, to, caracas, and, buenos, aires, and, the, decrease, of, the, mining, and, textile, production, this, crisis, proved, favorable, for, the, indigenous, rebellion, of, t, pac, amaru, ii, and, determined, the, progressive, decay, of, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, in, 1808, napoleon, invaded, the, iberian, peninsula, and, took, the, king, ferdinand, vii, hostage, later, in, 1812, the, cad, z, cortes, the, national, legislative, assembly, of, spain, promulgated, a, liberal, constitution, of, cadiz, these, events, inspired, emancipating, ideas, between, the, spanish, criollo, people, throughout, the, spanish, america, in, peru, the, creole, rebellion, of, hu, nuco, arose, in, 1812, and, the, rebellion, of, cuzco, arose, between, 1814, and, 1816, despite, these, rebellions, the, criollo, oligarchy, in, peru, remained, mostly, spanish, loyalist, which, accounts, for, the, fact, that, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, became, the, last, redoubt, of, the, spanish, dominion, in, south, america, peru, s, movement, toward, independence, was, launched, by, an, uprising, of, spanish, american, landowners, and, their, forces, led, by, jos, de, san, mart, n, of, argentina, and, sim, n, bol, var, of, venezuela, san, mart, n, who, had, displaced, the, royalists, of, chile, after, the, battle, of, chacabuco, and, who, had, disembarked, in, paracas, in, 1819, led, the, military, campaign, of, 4, 200, soldiers, the, expedition, which, included, warships, was, organized, and, financed, by, chile, which, sailed, from, valpara, so, in, august, 1820, san, martin, proclaimed, the, independence, of, peru, in, lima, on, 28, july, 1821, with, the, words, from, this, moment, on, peru, is, free, and, independent, by, the, general, will, of, the, people, and, the, justice, of, its, cause, that, god, defends, long, live, the, homeland, long, live, freedom, long, live, our, independence, san, mart, n, received, the, title, of, protector, of, peruvian, freedom, in, august, 1821, after, partially, liberating, peru, from, the, spanish, 295, on, 26, and, 27, july, 1822, bol, var, held, the, guayaquil, conference, with, san, mart, n, and, attempted, to, decide, the, political, fate, of, peru, san, mart, n, opted, for, a, constitutional, monarchy, whilst, bolivar, head, of, the, northern, expedition, favored, a, republic, nonetheless, they, both, followed, the, notion, that, it, was, to, be, independent, of, spain, following, the, interview, san, martin, abandoned, peru, on, 22, september, 1822, and, left, the, whole, command, of, the, independence, movement, to, simon, bolivar, the, peruvian, congress, named, bolivar, dictator, of, peru, on, 10, february, 1824, which, allowed, him, to, reorganize, the, political, and, military, administration, completely, assisted, by, general, antonio, jos, de, sucre, bol, var, decisively, defeated, the, spanish, cavalry, at, the, battle, of, jun, n, on, 6, august, 1824, sucre, destroyed, the, still, numerically, superior, remnants, of, the, spanish, forces, at, ayacucho, on, 9, december, 1824, the, war, would, not, end, until, the, last, royalist, holdouts, surrendered, the, real, felipe, fortress, in, 1826, the, victory, brought, about, political, independence, but, there, remained, indigenous, and, mestizo, supporters, of, the, monarchy, and, in, huanta, province, they, rebelled, in, 1825, 28, which, is, known, as, the, war, of, the, punas, or, the, huanta, rebellion, spain, made, futile, attempts, to, regain, its, former, colonies, such, as, the, battle, of, callao, 1866, and, only, in, 1879, finally, recognized, peruvian, independence, the, republican, era, of, peru, is, usually, considered, to, begin, after, the, declaration, of, independence, or, the, battle, of, ayacucho, in, 1824, and, its, periods, are, modelled, after, jorge, basadre, s, work, historia, de, la, rep, blica, del, per, after, the, battle, of, ayacucho, spanish, general, jos, de, canterac, signed, the, final, capitulation, of, the, royalist, army, in, peru, despite, the, spanish, capitulation, relations, between, both, states, would, not, be, established, until, 1879, during, this, era, the, first, militarism, spanish, primer, militarismo, a, period, where, several, military, figures, held, control, of, the, country, started, in, 1827, with, jos, de, la, mar, s, presidency, by, the, time, the, capitulation, had, been, signed, the, royalist, forces, in, peru, occupied, the, southern, provinces, slowly, surrendering, to, the, rebels, despite, the, apparent, end, of, the, successful, patriot, campaigns, two, spanish, figures, refused, to, accept, the, capitulation, and, established, themselves, in,

royalist, troops, until, the, arrival, of, reinforcements, for, the, patriot, side, this, led, to, rodil, s, forces, being, besieged, from, december, 5, 1824, to, january, 23, 1826, and, becoming, the, final, spanish, stronghold, in, south, america, the, deteriorating, conditions, of, the, besieged, fortress, eventually, led, to, the, surrender, of, rodil, and, his, forces, due, to, their,

continuation, of, the, war, an, event, that, was, prevented, by, the, political, instability, in, peru, that, led, to, the, deposition, of, la, mar, by, agust, n, gamarra, who, signed, a, peace, treaty, with, colombia, a, civil, war, broke, out, in, 1834, by, revolutionaries, who, opposed, orbegoso, as, a, successor, of, gamarra, orbegoso, proved, popular, with, the, population, and, the,

lower, and, upper, peru, eventually, led, to, the, salaverry, santa, cruz, war, which, itself, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, republic, of, south, peru, on, march, 17, 1836, and, the, republic, of, north, peru, on, august, 11, 1836, with, andr, s, de, santa, cruz, appointing, himself, the, supreme, protector, of, both, states, the, establishment, of, these, states, later, ended, with, the,

government, being, authoritarian, and, conservative, as, circumstances, required, after, several, years, of, civil, war, he, faced, the, challenge, of, pacifying, the, country, having, to, face, the, regenerative, revolution, that, manuel, ignacio, de, vivanco, led, in, arequipa, where, he, proclaimed, himself, supreme, chief, of, the, republic, in, january, 1841, to, combat, it, gamarra, sent, his, war, minister, ram, n, castilla, who, after, first, suffering, a, defeat, in, cachamarca, triumphed, over, the, vivanquistas, in, cuevillas, after, his, defeat, vivanco, fled, to, bolivia, gamarra, s, desire, to, unite, bolivia, and, peru, dovetailed, into, an, attempt, to, annex, bolivia, that, ultimately, failed, and, turned, into, a, protracted, war, after, reaching, la, paz, without, resistance, gamarra, participated, in, the, battle, of, ingavi, where, he, was, killed, in, action, in, the, aftermath, of, this, battle, bolivia, occupied, the, south, of, peru, until, a, peruvian, resistance, was, established, which, led, to, a, counterattack, that, was, ultimately, successful, due, to, the, limited, number, of, bolivian, troops, the, two, nations, signed, the, treaty, of, puno, on, june, 7, 1842, officially, ending, the, war, both, countries, agreed, to, remain, as, separate, sovereign, states, and, the, retreat, of, troops, in, peruvian, territory, was, accomplished, eight, days, later, bolivia, unconditionally, renounced, all, claims, in, southern, peruvian, territory, but, nevertheless, the, treaty, did, not, manage, to, solve, the, border, problem, or, the, unionist, movement, between, the, two, states, the, conflict, ended, with, a, return, to, the, situation, before, the, war, despite, this, peruvian, historiography, argues, that, the, victories, seen, in, all, the, battles, in, peruvian, soil, overshadow, the, defeat, at, ingavi, leaving, peru, in, a, more, favorable, outcome, after, the, end, of, the, war, after, gamarra, s, death, manuel, men, ndez, was, recognized, as, provisional, president, however, several, military, leaders, became, involved, in, a, struggle, for, power, in, the, north, juan, cris, stomo, torrico, in, the, south, antonio, guti, rrez, de, la, fuente, domingo, nieto, and, juan, francisco, de, vidal, and, in, arequipa, manuel, ignacio, de, vivanco, men, ndez, could, not, maintain, power, as, he, was, deposed, by, torrico, the, anarchy, led, to, the, peruvian, civil, war, of, 1843, 1844, by, then, a, government, had, been, established, by, vivanco, known, as, the, directory, spanish, el, directorio, in, contrast, to, this, new, government, a, rebellion, led, by, domingo, nieto, also, sought, to, establish, itself, as, the, legitimate, government, on, september, 3, 1843, the, revolutionaries, constituted, a, provisional, government, junta, of, the, free, departments, in, cuzco, spanish, junta, de, gobierno, provisional, de, los, departamentos, libres, whose, presidency, was, assumed, by, domingo, nieto, who, would, be, succeeded, by, castilla, after, his, death, in, 1844, the, civil, war, reached, its, end, in, the, battle, of, carmen, alto, of, july, 22, 1844, between, vivanco, and, castilla, s, troops, near, arequipa, after, the, defeat, of, vivanco, s, troops, vivanco, himself, arrived, in, callao, on, july, 27, being, arrested, by, prefect, of, lima, domingo, el, as, and, exiled, to, chile, a, few, days, later, with, castilla, as, the, country, s, new, leader, the, anarchy, came, to, an, end, after, castilla, assumed, the, presidency, of, peru, peru, entered, a, period, of, peace, and, economic, prosperity, as, the, anarchic, period, had, been, put, to, an, end, and, peru, established, a, virtual, international, monopoly, in, the, trade, of, guano, this, allowed, the, government, to, repay, its, external, debt, earning, it, international, economic, prestige, several, reforms, including, education, were, put, into, place, and, the, economy, continued, to, grow, until, the, 1860s, castilla, was, replaced, by, his, advisor, jos, rufino, echenique, in, 1851, who, continued, his, work, as, the, economy, continued, to, grow, his, government, was, of, a, conservative, nature, which, eventually, led, to, conflict, with, the, liberals, on, october, 23, 1851, peru, signed, its, first, border, treaty, with, brazil, where, it, ceded, territory, in, the, amazon, rainforest, disputed, by, ecuador, who, claimed, the, territory, as, its, own, echenique, was, accused, of, corruption, by, its, opponents, with, some, pointing, out, a, lavish, party, that, had, been, hosted, by, his, wife, victoria, trist, n, as, proof, of, his, reckless, spending, which, appeared, as, an, insult, to, the, general, poverty, of, the, country, others, such, as, domingo, el, as, made, the, accusation, on, the, basis, of, echenique, being, too, generous, regarding, his, payment, of, the, country, s, external, debt, amid, the, growing, conflict, between, the, conservative, government, and, the, liberal, opposition, the, liberal, revolution, of, 1854, broke, out, with, the, liberals, soon, headed, by, castilla, defeating, the, government, at, the, battle, of, la, palma, and, castilla, being, reinstated, as, president, castilla, summoned, a, national, convention, whose, representatives, were, elected, by, direct, and, universal, suffrage, settling, on, july, 14, 1855, this, convention, authored, the, liberal, constitution, of, 1856, dissatisfied, with, the, liberal, regime, that, was, being, established, the, conservatives, rose, up, in, arequipa, led, by, the, caudillo, manuel, ignacio, de, vivanco, an, old, rival, of, castilla, a, bloody, civil, war, broke, out, culminating, in, the, triumph, of, castilla, after, the, capture, of, arequipa, on, march, 7, 1858, between, 1857, and, 1860, a, war, broke, out, against, ecuador, over, disputed, territories, in, the, amazon, that, ecuador, had, allegedly, sold, to, british, companies, to, pay, for, its, foreign, debt, the, peruvian, victory, in, the, war, prevented, the, ecuadorian, claims, to, settle, in, the, area, in, 1865, civil, war, broke, out, waged, by, the, forces, headed, by, colonel, mariano, ignacio, prado, against, the, government, of, president, juan, antonio, pezet, due, to, the, weakness, that, he, was, alleged, to, have, shown, in, solving, the, crisis, caused, by, the, spanish, occupation, of, the, chincha, islands, most, specifically, due, to, the, signing, of, the, vivanco, pareja, treaty, as, a, result, pezet, was, overthrown, and, prado, declared, an, alliance, against, spain, alongside, chile, bolivia, and, ecuador, also, declaring, war, on, spain, on, may, 2, 1866, the, battle, of, callao, took, place, and, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, in, 1879, the, expenses, caused, by, the, war, severely, affected, the, peruvian, economy, which, began, to, decline, with, prado, as, provisional, and, later, constitutional, president, a, new, constitution, was, adopted, its, extremely, liberal, nature, led, to, a, civil, war, headed, by, pedro, diez, canseco, and, jos, balta, which, ended, prado, s, presidency, and, re, established, the, 1860, constitution, the, new, balta, government, appointed, a, young, nicol, s, de, pi, rola, as, minister, of, economy, who, signed, a, treaty, with, the, jewish, french, businessman, auguste, dreyfus, for, its, part, the, house, of, dreyfus, paid, s, two, million, in, advance, and, undertook, to, pay, at, a, rate, of, s, 700, thousand, each, month, and, to, cover, the, interest, on, the, peruvian, foreign, debt, as, a, result, of, the, income, from, the, dreyfus, contract, peru, embarked, on, a, railroad, building, program, the, american, entrepreneur, henry, meiggs, built, a, standard, gauge, line, from, callao, across, the, andes, to, the, interior, huancayo, he, built, the, line, and, controlled, its, politics, for, a, while, in, the, end, he, bankrupted, himself, and, the, country, financial, problems, forced, the, government, to, take, over, in, 1874, the, labor, conditions, were, complex, with, conflicts, arising, from, different, levels, of, skill, and, organization, among, the, north, americans, europeans, blacks, and, the, chinese, conditions, were, very, brutal, for, the, chinese, and, led, to, strikes, and, violent, suppression, elections, were, held, in, 1872, with, manuel, pardo, of, the, civilista, party, being, elected, as, the, first, civilian, president, of, peru, the, ascension, of, a, civil, government, disturbed, many, members, of, the, military, who, believed, they, would, lose, the, privileges, that, they, had, enjoyed, until, then, among, the, concerned, were, the, guti, rrez, brothers, originally, from, huancarqui, the, brothers, headed, by, colonel, tom, s, guti, rrez, carried, out, a, coup, d, tat, against, balta, on, july, 22, 1872, the, new, government, lasted, until, the, 26th, when, the, brothers, were, overthrown, with, three, of, them, being, killed, and, only, one, surviving, pardo, became, president, on, august, 2, ending, the, first, militarism, that, had, existed, since, 1827, under, his, government, the, treaty, of, defensive, alliance, was, signed, with, bolivia, which, would, lead, peru, to, fight, against, chile, 7, years, later, in, 1879, peru, entered, the, war, of, the, pacific, after, bolivia, invoked, its, alliance, with, peru, against, chile, the, peruvian, government, tried, to, mediate, the, dispute, by, sending, a, diplomatic, team, to, negotiate, with, the, chilean, government, but, the, committee, concluded, that, war, was, inevitable, on, 14, march, 1879, bolivia, declared, war, and, chile, in, response, declared, war, on, bolivia, and, peru, on, 5, april, 1879, with, peru, following, with, its, own, declaration, of, war, the, next, day, the, chilean, land, campaigns, in, tarapac, tacna, and, arica, lima, and, bre, a, eventually, led, to, the, chilean, occupation, of, these, territories, which, were, administered, from, occupied, lima, in, parallel, with, the, occupying, administration, a, collaborationist, government, was, also, established, in, lima, under, the, protection, of, chile, the, government, was, initially, based, in, la, magdalena, and, then, in, cajamarca, this, government, s, legitimacy, was, disputed, by, the, peruvian, resistance, which, continued, fighting, in, the, sierra, the, chilean, naval, campaign, also, proved, crucial, and, allowed, for, attacks, in, the, northern, coast, of, the, country, one, notable, figure, of, this, campaign, who, is, held, in, high, esteem, by, peruvians, and, chileans, alike, was, miguel, grau, who, was, killed, in, action, during, the, battle, of, angamos, and, whose, ship, the, hu, scar, was, captured, by, the, chilean, navy, the, war, reached, its, peak, after, the, battle, of, tacna, which, effectively, destroyed, the, peruvian, bolivian, alliance, and, ended, with, a, chilean, victory, over, peru, and, bolivia, with, the, former, s, government, in, lima, signing, the, treaty, of, anc, n, in, 1883, where, the, department, of, tarapac, was, ceded, to, chile, and, the, fates, of, the, provinces, of, tacna, and, arica, were, to, be, decided, by, a, plebiscite, that, was, meant, to, take, place, ten, years, after, the, treaty, but, would, eventually, never, take, place, the, question, over, the, peruvian, provinces, of, tacna, and, arica, would, manifest, itself, as, the, chilean, peruvian, territorial, dispute, while, the, bolivian, reaction, to, the, loss, of, its, litoral, department, and, thus, its, access, to, the, sea, would, manifest, itself, as, the, bolivian, chilean, territorial, dispute, and, commemorated, annually, with, the, d, a, del, mar, after, the, war, of, the, pacific, an, extraordinary, effort, of, rebuilding, began, and, military, figures, once, again, assumed, control, of, the, government, due, to, the, perceived, weakness, of, civilian, heads, of, state, in, a, period, of, constant, war, beginning, the, second, militarism, spanish, segundo, militarismo, in, contrast, to, the, first, militarism, the, military, leaders, returned, to, the, political, arena, but, no, longer, as, triumphant, heroes, but, as, the, defeated, the, government, started, to, initiate, a, number, of, social, and, economic, reforms, in, order, to, recover, from, the, damage, of, the, war, during, this, period, the, occupied, provinces, of, tacna, and, arica, were, subject, to, a, process, known, as, chilenization, where, chilean, culture, was, promoted, in, order, to, replace, peruvian, culture, groups, known, as, patriotic, leagues, were, also, established, in, order, to, encourage, peruvians, to, leave, while, chilean, families, soon, began, to, emigrate, to, the, region, those, who, left, established, themselves, mainly, in, callao, or, participated, in, the, colonization, project, carried, out, by, the, local, government, in, loreto, to, counter, colombian, claims, over, the, region, establishing, the, settlements, of, puerto, arica, and, tarapac, after, the, signing, of, the, salom, n, lozano, treaty, in, 1922, these, settlements, would, be, ceded, to, colombia, with, some, settlers, moving, to, peru, and, establishing, the, settlements, of, nuevo, tarapac, and, puerto, arica, due, to, iglesias, re, establishment, of, the, indigenous, tribute, and, abuses, committed, against, indians, by, landowners, on, march, 1, 1885, a, rebellion, in, huaraz, headed, by, pedro, pablo, atuspar, a, began, with, the, conflict, coming, to, an, end, only, in, 1887, miguel, iglesias, regenerator, government, that, had, been, established, under, chilean, occupation, and, signed,

known, as, the, hero, of, bre, a, opposed, iglesias, and, received, more, popular, support, than, iglesias, government, iglesias, attempted, to, negotiate, with, c, ceres, for, his, support, eventually, negotiations, failed, and, he, demanded, his, unconditional, submission, for, his, part, c, ceres, proceeded, to, proclaim, himself, president, on, july, 16, 1884, arguing, the, breakdown, of, the, constitutional, order, this, disagreement, led, to, the, peruvian, civil, war, of, 1884, 1885, the, forces, of, iglesias, and, c, ceres, initially, clashed, in, lima, and, later, in, trujillo, faced, with, his, defeats, on, the, north, coast, c, ceres, withdrew, to, the, south, center, cuzco, arequipa, apur, mac, and, ayacucho, where, he, was, able, to, reorganize, his, army, to, attack, again, he, ordered, his, troops, to, be, defeated, near, jauja, while, he, moved, his, best, troops, to, huaripampa, who, cut, off, bridges, that, would, ve, allowed, iglesias, troops, return, and, eventually, moved, to, lima, where, they, carried, out, a, successful, offensive, against, iglesias, ending, the, civil, war, iglesias, would, be, exiled, to, spain, only, returning, in, 1895, after, being, elected, as, senator, for, cajamarca, dying, later, in, 1909, c, ceres, assumed, the, presidency, for, the, second, time, on, august, 10, 1894, but, he, lacked, legitimacy, and, popularity, the, anti, cacerists, formed, the, national, coalition, made, up, of, democrats, and, civil, supporters, who, elected, nicol, s, de, pi, rola, as, leader, then, exiled, in, chile, throughout, peru, groups, of, montoneros, arose, that, joined, the, cause, of, the, coalition, pi, rola, returned, to, peru, disembarked, in, puerto, caballas, in, ica, and, went, to, chincha, where, he, gave, a, manifesto, to, the, nation, taking, the, title, of, national, delegate, and, immediately, campaigning, on, lima, leading, the, montoneros, they, attacked, the, capital, from, march, 17, to, 19, 1895, seeing, himself, deprived, of, the, support, of, the, people, turned, massively, towards, the, coalition, partners, c, ceres, resigned, and, went, into, exile, a, government, board, was, installed, after, the, victory, in, lima, of, pi, rola, s, montoneros, and, the, departure, of, c, ceres, into, exile, and, manuel, candamo, was, elected, president, of, a, government, board, to,

pierola, s, election, in, 1895, his, second, term, was, successfully, completed, in, 1899, and, was, marked, by, his, reconstruction, of, a, devastated, peru, by, initiating, fiscal, military, religious, and, civil, reforms, with, the, county, in, a, delicate, state, political, stability, was, achieved, only, in, the, early, 1900s, with, de, pi, rola, elected, president, of, peru, the, country, began, its, period, known, as, the, aristocratic, republic, spanish, rep, blica, aristocr, tica, owing, its, name, to, the, fact, that, most, of, the, presidents, that, ruled, the, country, during, this, period, were, from, the, country, s, social, elite, economic, dependence, on, english, and, american, capitalism, was, accentuated, and, new, economic, activities, were, developed, agro, export, sugar, and, cotton, rubber, extraction, and, oil, extraction, however, the, country, did, not, industrialize, due, to, the, fact, that, a, purely, economistic, development, perspective, was, formed, through, a, rentier, and, primary, exporter, state, which, increased, discrimination, and, exploitation, of, indigenous, peoples, through, correr, os, yanaconajes, and, enganches, one, such, example, was, the, putumayo, genocide, which, took, place, during, the, amazon, rubber, boom, the, discomfort, of, the, popular, classes, was, manifested, in, the, emergence, of, the, anarcho, syndicalist, labor, movement, and, the, outbreak, of, strikes, this, period, of, history, soon, saw, its, first, conflicts, with, its, first, one, taking, place, in, 1896, separatists, in, loreto, revolted, against, the, government, seceded, from, peru, and, established, the, short, lived, federal, state, of, loreto, the, government, s, response, was, to, send, troops, to, the, area, in, order,

with, ecuador, and, in, 1911, with, colombia, the, latter, of, which, became, known, as, the, la, pedrera, conflict, due, to, chile, s, continuing, chilenization, policies, in, tacna, and, arica,

years, of, his, government, an, acute, economic, crisis, manifested, itself, motivated, by, accelerated, internal, indebtedness, national, defense, expenses, and, the, budget, deficit, guillermo, billinghurst, wanted, to, favor, the, working, class, which, earned, him, opposition, from, conservative, elements, he, had, a, tenacious, struggle, with, congress, dominated, by, civilistas, and, leguiistas, his, political, enemies, it, was, then, proposed, to, dissolve, parliament, and, summon, the, people, to, carry, out, fundamental, constitutional, reforms, which, provoked, the, military, uprising, of, colonel, scar, r, benavides, known, as, the, hero, of, la, pedrera, who, overthrew, billinghurst, on, february, 4, 1914, after, assuming, control, of, the, government, benavides, faced, the, monetary, problem, and, promised, to, restore, the, legal, order, in, 1915, he, convened, a, convention, of, the, civilist, liberal, and, constitutional, parties, so, that, they, could, launch, a, unified, candidacy, the, chosen, one, was, former, president, jos, pardo, y, barreda, of, the, civilista, party, who, overwhelmingly, won, the, elections, that, year, defeating, the, symbolic, candidacy, of, carlos, de, pi, rola, of, the, democratic, party, the, second, government, of, jos, pardo, was, characterized, by, political, and, social, violence, a, symptom, of, the, exhaustion, of, civil, society, and, the, world, crisis, as, a, result, of, the, first, world, war, the, economic, condition, of, the, working, class, worsened, and, the, field, was, prepared, for, the, development, of, trade, union, action, there, were, successive, strikes, that, demanded, the, reduction, of, subsistence, prices, and, the, implementation, of, the, 8, hour, work, day, the, latter, was, finally, granted, by, decree, of, january, 15, 1919, in, the, southern, andes, the, abuses, of, landowners, and, gamonales, on, the, native, and, peasant, population, motivated, many, indigenous, uprisings, such, as, the, one, led, in, 1915, by, teodomiro, guti, rrez, cuevas, also, known, by, his, pseudonym, rumi, maqui, pardo, called, for, elections, in, 1919, in, which, former, president, augusto, b, legu, a, ran, who, faced, the, official, candidacy, represented, by, ntero, asp, llaga, the, elections, which, were, not, deemed, very, fair, declared, legu, a, the, winner, but, numerous, votes, were, annulled, in, the, official, recount, faced, with, the, danger, that, the, elections, would, be, annulled, and, that, they, would, be, transferred, to, congress, where, the, civilistas, had, a, majority, legu, a, and, his, supporters, staged, a, coup, with, the, support, of, the, gendarmerie, on, july, 4, 1919, thus, ended, the, aristocratic, republic, and, began, what, would, become, legu, a, s, oncenio, as, had, happened, with, his, previous, government, the, entrance, of, american, capital, became, general, and, the, bourgeoisie, was, favored, this, policy, along, with, increased, dependence, on, foreign, investment, focused, opposition, from, the, most, progressive, sectors, of, peruvian, society, against, the, landowner, oligarchy, the, presidency, of, legu, a, coincided, with, the, centennial, celebrations, of, peru, s, independence, on, july, 28, 1921, and, in, 1924, commemorating, the, battle, of, ayacucho, legu, a, referred, to, his, government, as, the, new, motherland, spanish, la, nueva, patria, which, became, known, for, its, urban, transformation, of, lima, to, coincide, with, the, aforementioned, centennial, a, final, peace, treaty, was, signed, between, peru, and, chile, in, 1929, known, as, the, treaty, of, lima, as, per, the, treaty, tacna, returned, to, peru, and, peru, yielded, permanently, the, formerly, rich, provinces, of, arica, and, tarapac, but, kept, certain, rights, to, the, port, activities, in, arica, and, restrictions, on, what, chile, can, do, on, those, territories, the, treaty, was, controversial, in, peru, but, nevertheless, put, a, major, end, to, the, chilean, peruvian, territorial, dispute, in, 1921, peruvian, captain, guillermo, cervantes, declared, the, federal, state, of, loreto, which, existed, as, a, de, facto, autonomous, region, of, the, country, the, rebel, authorities, authorized, the, distribution, of, provisional, banknotes, made, out, of, cardboard, used, by, locals, as, currency, and, local, ports, were, ordered, shut, with, local, trade, and, navigation, being, tightly, controlled, the, revolution, was, quickly, accepted, by, the, local, population, but, was, met, negatively, by, peru, s, president, augusto, legu, a, who, sent, a, few, troops, to, the, area, and, shut, down, trade, to, the, region, the, local, guerrillas, military, inferiority, soon, became, apparent, and, by, early, 1922, a, famished, iquitos, had, been, occupied, by, peruvian, troops, headed, by, peruvian, captain, genaro, matos, while, cervantes, had, escaped, on, january, 9, and, sought, refuge, in, the, ecuadorian, jungle, and, his, army, soon, became, little, more, than, an, insurgency, in, 1922, another, treaty, the, salom, n, lozano, treaty, was, signed, between, peru, and, colombia, with, the, united, states, acting, as, a, mediator, where, a, large, amount, of, territory, was, ceded, to, colombia, allowing, them, access, to, the, amazon, river, further, reducing, peru, s, territory, with, the, exception, of, a, de, jure, exclave, in, sucumb, os, this, treaty, also, proved, controversial, most, notably, in, loreto, as, protests, took, place, and, local, dissatisfaction, would, eventually, lead, to, the, leticia, incident, in, 1932, nevertheless, the, treaty, also, ended, the, colombian, peruvian, territorial, dispute, although, it, was, also, disputed, by, ecuador, in, 1924, from, mexico, university, reform, leaders, in, peru, who, had, been, forced, into, exile, by, the, government, founded, the, american, people, s, revolutionary, alliance, apra, which, had, a, major, influence, on, the, country, s, political, life, apra, is, largely, a, political, expression, of, the, university, reform, and, workers, struggles, of, the, years, 1918, 1920, the, movement, draws, its, influences, from, the, mexican, revolution, and, its, 1917, constitution, particularly, on, issues, of, agrarianism, and, indigenism, and, to, a, lesser, extent, from, the, russian, revolution, close, to, marxism, its, leader, haya, de, la, torre, declares, that, apra, is, the, marxist, interpretation, of, the, american, reality, it, nevertheless, moves, away, from, it, on, the, question, of, class, struggle, and, on, the, importance, given, to, the, struggle, for, the, political, unity, of, latin, america, in, 1928, the, peruvian, socialist, party, was, founded, notably, under, the, leadership, of, jos, carlos, mari, tegui, himself, a, former, member, of, apra, shortly, afterwards, in, 1929, the, party, created, the, general, confederation, of, workers, after, the, worldwide, crisis, of, 1929, numerous, brief, governments, followed, one, another, the, apra, party, had, the, opportunity, to, cause, system, reforms, by, means, of, political, actions, but, it, was, not, successful, this, was, a, nationalistic, movement, populist, and, anti, imperialist, headed, by, v, ctor, ra, l, haya, de, la, torre, in, 1924, the, socialist, party, of, peru, later, the, peruvian, communist, party, was, created, four, years, later, and, it, was, led, by, jos, carlos, mari, tegui, this, period, would, come, to, an, end, after, a, coup, d, tat, carried, out, by, lieutenant, colonel, luis, miguel, s, nchez, cerro, and, his, sympathizers, with, general, manuel, mar, a, ponce, brousset, assuming, the, interim, presidency, for, two, days, until, s, nchez, cerro, s, return, to, lima, from, arequipa, with, legu, a, overthrown, the, country, entered, its, third, militarism, spanish, tercer, militarismo, as, military, figures, once, again, took, control, of, the, government, a, military, junta, was, established, and, manuel, mar, a, ponce, brousset, was, the, first, to, assume, the, presidency, being, succeeded, by, the, more, popular, luis, miguel, s, nchez, cerro, who, was, the, first, peruvian, president, to, have, indigenous, peruvian, ancestry, as, well, as, allegedly, also, being, of, afro, peruvian, malagasy, descent, based, on, a, rumour, he, was, from, a, part, of, piura, populated, by, descendants, of, malagasy, slaves, other, major, events, of, this, period, were, the, beginning, of, the, irruption, of, the, organized, masses, in, politics, and, the, growth, of, the, middle, classes, s, nchez, cerro, called, for, elections, while, in, power, intending, to, run, as, a, candidate, due, to, this, a, revolt, took, place, in, arequipa, where, s, nchez, cerro, was, forced, to, resign, as, a, result, then, archbishop, of, lima, monsignor, mariano, holgu, n, took, over, the, junta, on, april, 1, 1931, after, a, few, hours, holgu, n, transferred, his, power, to, leoncio, el, as, el, as, had, called, a, meeting, where, it, was, agreed, that, david, samanez, ocampo, would, become, the, new, head, of, state, but, arrangements, for, this, never, took, place, as, he, was, overthrown, by, gustavo, jim, nez, who, had, returned, from, arequipa, where, he, had, travelled, to, stop, the, revolt, nevertheless, samanez, ocampo, who, was, chosen, due, to, his, popularity, assumed, the, presidency, on, march, 11, 1931, and, called, for, elections, on, october, 11, of, the, same, year, as, a, result, s, nchez, cerro, was, elected, president, of, peru, s, nchez, cerro, s, government, was, opposed, by, the, left, wing, american, popular, revolutionary, alliance, and, as, a, result, political, repression, was, brutal, in, the, early, 1930s, with, tens, of, thousands, of, apristas, were, executed, or, imprisoned, a, revolt, that, took, place, in, trujillo, and, was, brutally, repressed, was, one, such, example, this, period, was, also, characterized, by, a, sudden, population, growth, and, an, increase, in, urbanization, according, to, alberto, flores, galindo, by, the, 1940, census, the, last, that, utilized, racial, categories, mestizos, were, grouped, with, whites, and, the, two, constituted, more, than, 53, percent, of, the, population, mestizos, likely, outnumbered, the, indigenous, peoples, and, were, the, largest, population, group, under, s, nchez, cerro, s, constitutional, government, a, new, constitution, would, be, adopted, and, works, such, as, the, construction, of, the, carretera, central, which, connected, lima, with, la, oroya, tarma, and, la, merced, and, the, investment, in, the, peruvian, armed, forces, took, place, the, latter, proved, to, be, an, important, part, of, the, government, as, all, three, branches, of, the, armed, forces, would, soon, become, involved, in, the, conflict, with, colombia, that, would, erupt, into, armed, conflict, in, september, 1932, the, foreign, policy, of, s, nchez, cerro, s, government, was, initially, intended, to, respect, the, border, treaties, signed, up, to, that, point, but, public, opposition, to, the, salom, n, lozano, treaty, eventually, led, to, a, civilian, takeover, of, the, port, town, of, leticia, which, ended, up, being, supported, by, the, government, the, event, led, to, protests, in, colombia, and, the, beginning, of, the, colombia, peru, war, on, september, 1, 1932, on, april, 30, 1933, while, reviewing, troops, in, the, santa, beatriz, hipodrome, s, nchez, cerro, was, assassinated, by, abelardo, gonz, lez, leiva, who, shot, him, three, times, it, was, later, publicized, that, gonz, lez, was, a, member, of, the, apra, party, leading, to, speculation, on, whether, he, had, been, ordered, to, carry, out, the, attack, or, had, acted, alone, s, nchez, cerro, s, was, succeeded, as, supreme, chief, of, his, political, party, revolutionary, union, by, luis, a, flores, who, reconstructed, the, party, into, a, more, fascist, direction, modelling, it, after, the, national, fascist, party, of, italy, scar, r, benavides, assumed, the, presidency, as, a, result, of, s, nchez, cerro, s, assassination, and, upheld, the, salom, n, lozano, treaty, with, colombia, leading, to, the, end, of, the, war, he, also, signed, the, general, amnesty, law, on, august, 9, 1933, which, favored, the, apristas, but, after, a, revolutionary, attempt, in, el, agustino, the, anti, aprista, persecution, resumed, the, apristas, responded, with, terrorist, acts, throughout, the, country, including, the, assassination, of, antonio, mir, quesada, owner, of, el, comercio, and, his, wife, on, may, 15, 1935, under, benavides, government, new, ministries, were, created, and, tourism, was, promoted, the,

rooms, and, sewers, during, this, period, the, spanish, civil, war, began, in, 1936, as, a, result, pro, republican, and, pro, nationalist, factions, were, established, by, the, spanish, residents, in, peru, as, well, as, their, peruvian, sympathizers, the, former, was, more, popular, among, left, leaning, groups, including, the, apristas, while, the, latter, was, more, popular, among, the, aristocracy, and, the, spanish, expatriates, living, in, peru, evoking, the, feeling, of, the, hispanidad, a, spanish, peruvian, clothing, fund, spanish, ropero, peruano, espa, ol, was, established, in, lima, which, was, nominally, in, charge, of, delivering, clothing, to, the, children, of, both, factions, but, ended, up, assisting, the, nationalist, faction, almost, exclusively, as, a, result, of, its, support, of, the, francoist, side, peru, did, not, receive, republican, exiles, after, the, war, instead, continuing, its, relations, with, the, new, government, in, spain, the, conflict, increased, the, divide, between, the, right, and, left, leaning, sectors, of, society, most, notably, in, cities, such, as, arequipa, during, the, last, years, of, the, benavides, government, the, weariness, of, the, population, became, noticeable, on, february, 19, 1939, general, antonio, rodr, guez, ram, rez, attempted, a, coup, apparently, with, great, support, from, various, sectors,

despite, the, new, civilian, government, this, era, would, be, characterized, by, two, major, military, conflicts, the, ecuadorian, peruvian, war, and, world, war, ii, manuel, prado, assumed, the, presidency, on, december, 8, 1939, beginning, what, would, be, his, first, government, a, previously, largely, unknown, politician, he, was, predicted, to, not, last, long, in, office, but, he, displayed, a, strategic, flexibility, that, eventually, earned, him, support, his, government, largely, continued, the, work, started, by, general, benavides, maintaining, strong, links, with, the, oligarchy, it, was, a, relative, democracy, he, kept, the, aprista, party, outlawed, and, received, the, support, of, the, communist, party, during, his, tenure, as, president, skirmishes, took,

and, peru, which, was, accomplished, with, the, exception, of, a, small, part, of, the, border, that, eventually, continued, the, dispute, as, a, result, of, the, delimitation, of, the, border, in, the, coast, integration, between, both, countries, continued, to, grow, during, the, following, years, peru, remained, neutral, during, world, war, ii, continuing, its, relations, with, countries, in,

tackled, the, social, and, economic, problems, of, the, country, although, mari, tegui, died, at, a, young, age, president, bustamante, y, rivero, hoped, to, create, a, more, democratic, government, by, limiting, the, power, of, the, military, and, the, oligarchy, elected, with, the, cooperation, of, the, apra, conflict, soon, arose, between, the, president, and, haya, de, la, torre, without, the, support, of, the, apra, party, bustamante, y, rivero, found, his, presidency, severely, limited, the, president, disbanded, his, aprista, cabinet, and, replaced, it, with, a, mostly, military, one, in, 1948, minister, manuel, a, odr, a, and, other, right, wing, elements, of, the, cabinet, urged, bustamante, y, rivero, to, ban, the, apra, but, when, the, president, refused, odr, a, resigned, his, post, in, a, military, coup, on, 27, october, gen, manuel, a, odr, a, became, the, new, president, odr, a, s, presidency, was, known, as, the, ochenio, he, cracked, down, on, apra, members, and, sympathizers, momentarily, pleasing, the, oligarchy, and, all, others, on, the, right, but, followed, a, populist, course, that, won, him, great, favor, with, the, poor, and, lower, classes, a, thriving, economy, allowed, him, to, indulge, in, expensive, but, crowd, pleasing, social, policies, at, the, same, time, however, civil, rights, were, severely, restricted, and, corruption, was, rampant, throughout, his, r, gime, it, was, feared, that, his, dictatorship, would, run, indefinitely, so, it, came, as, a, surprise, when, odr, a, allowed, new, elections, during, this, time, fernando, bela, nde, terry, started, his, political, career, and, led, the, slate, submitted, by, the, national, front, of, democratic, youth, after, the, national, election, board, refused, to, accept, his, candidacy, he, led, a, massive, protest, and, the, striking, image, of, bela, nde, walking, with, the, flag, was, featured, by, news, magazine, caretas, the, following, day, in, an, article, entitled, as, nacen, los, lideres, thus, are, leaders, born, bela, nde, s, 1956, candidacy, was, ultimately, unsuccessful, as, the, dictatorship, favored, right, wing, candidacy, of, manuel, prado, ugarteche, took, first, place, bela, nde, ran, for, president, once, again, in, the, national, elections, of, 1962, this, time, with, his, own, party, acci, n, popular, popular, action, the, results, were, very, tight, he, ended, in, second, place, following, v, ctor, ra, l, haya, de, la, torre, apra, by, less, than, 14, 000, votes, since, none, of, the, candidates, managed, to, get, the, constitutionally, established, minimum, of, one, third, of, the, vote, required, to, win, outright, selection, of, the, president, should, have, fallen, to, congress, the, long, held, antagonistic, relationship, between, the, military, and, apra, prompted, haya, de, la, torre, to, make, a, deal, with, former, dictator, odria, who, had, come, in, third, which, would, have, resulted, in, odria, taking, the, presidency, in, a, coalition, government, however, widespread, allegations, of, fraud, prompted, the, peruvian, military, to, depose, prado, and, install, a, military, junta, led, by, ricardo, perez, godoy, godoy, ran, a, short, transitional, government, and, held, new, elections, in, 1963, which, were, won, by, bela, nde, by, a, more, comfortable, but, still, narrow, five, percent, margin, bela, nde, took, office, on, july, 28, of, the, same, year, his, presidency, would, continue, until, its, interruption, in, 1968, throughout, latin, america, in, the, 1960s, communist, movements, inspired, by, the, cuban, revolution, sought, to, win, power, through, guerrilla, warfare, the, revolutionary, left, movement, or, mir, launched, an, insurrection, that, had, been, crushed, by, 1965, but, peru, s, internal, strife, would, only, accelerate, until, its, climax, in, the, 1990s, after, a, crisis, involving, the, missing, last, page, of, a, document, signed, between, the, peruvian, government, and, the, international, petroleum, company, general, juan, velasco, alvarado, overthrew, elected, president, fernando, bela, nde, terry, in, a, successful, coup,
