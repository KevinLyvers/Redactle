the, haitian, revolution, french, r, volution, ha, tienne, or, french, la, guerre, de, l, ind, pendance, french, pronunciation, haitian, creole, lag, d, lendependans, was, a, successful, insurrection, by, self, liberated, slaves, against, french, colonial, rule, in, saint, domingue, now, the, sovereign, state, of, haiti, the, revolt, began, on, 22, august, 1791, and, ended, in, 1804, with, the, former, colony, s, independence, it, involved, black, biracial, french, spanish, british, and, polish, participants, with, the, ex, slave, toussaint, louverture, emerging, as, haiti, s, most, prominent, general, the, revolution, was, the, only, known, slave, uprising, in, human, history, that, led, to, the, founding, of, a, state, which, was, both, free, from, slavery, though, not, from, forced, labour, and, ruled, by, non, whites, and, former, captives, the, successful, revolution, was, a, defining, moment, in, the, history, of, the, atlantic, world, and, the, revolution, s, effects, on, the, institution, of, slavery, were, felt, throughout, the, americas, the, end, of, french, rule, and, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, former, colony, was, followed, by, a, successful, defense, of, the, freedoms, the, former, slaves, had, won, and, with, the, collaboration, of, already, free, people, of, color, of, their, independence, from, white, europeans, the, revolution, was, the, largest, slave, uprising, since, spartacus, unsuccessful, revolt, against, the, roman, republic, nearly, 1, 900, years, earlier, and, challenged, long, held, european, beliefs, about, alleged, black, inferiority, and, about, slaves, ability, to, achieve, and, maintain, their, own, freedom, the, rebels, organizational, capacity, and, tenacity, under, pressure, inspired, stories, that, shocked, and, frightened, slave, owners, in, the, hemisphere, compared, to, other, atlantic, revolutions, the, events, in, haiti, have, received, comparatively, little, public, attention, in, retrospect, historian, michel, rolph, trouillot, characterizes, the, historiography, of, the, haitian, revolution, as, being, silenced, by, that, of, the, french, revolution, much, of, caribbean, economic, development, in, the, 18th, century, was, contingent, on, europeans, demand, for, sugar, plantation, owners, produced, sugar, as, a, commodity, crop, from, cultivation, of, sugarcane, which, required, extensive, labor, the, colony, of, saint, domingue, also, had, extensive, coffee, cocoa, and, indigo, plantations, but, these, were, smaller, and, less, profitable, than, the, sugar, plantations, the, commodity, crops, were, traded, for, european, goods, starting, in, the, 1730s, french, engineers, constructed, complex, irrigation, systems, to, increase, sugarcane, production, by, the, 1740s, saint, domingue, together, with, the, british, colony, of, jamaica, had, become, the, main, suppliers, of, the, world, s, sugar, production, of, sugar, depended, on, extensive, manual, labor, provided, by, enslaved, africans, an, average, of, 600, ships, engaged, every, year, in, shipping, products, from, saint, domingue, to, bordeaux, and, the, value, of, the, colony, s, crops, and, goods, was, almost, equal, in, value, to, all, of, the, products, shipped, from, the, thirteen, colonies, to, great, britain, the, livelihood, of, 1, million, of, the, approximately, 25, million, people, who, lived, in, france, in, 1789, depended, directly, upon, the, agricultural, imports, from, saint, domingue, and, several, million, indirectly, depended, upon, trade, from, the, colony, to, maintain, their, standard, of, living, saint, domingue, was, the, most, profitable, french, colony, in, the, world, indeed, one, of, the, most, profitable, of, all, the, european, colonies, in, the, 18th, century, slavery, sustained, sugar, production, under, harsh, conditions, diseases, such, as, malaria, brought, from, africa, and, yellow, fever, caused, high, mortality, thriving, in, the, tropical, caribbean, climate, in, 1787, alone, the, french, imported, about, 20, 000, slaves, from, africa, into, saint, domingue, while, the, british, imported, about, 38, 000, slaves, total, to, all, of, their, caribbean, colonies, the, death, rate, from, yellow, fever, was, such, that, at, least, 50, of, the, slaves, from, africa, died, within, a, year, of, arriving, so, while, the, white, planters, preferred, to, work, their, slaves, as, hard, as, possible, providing, them, only, the, bare, minimum, of, food, and, shelter, they, calculated, that, it, was, better, to, get, the, most, work, out, of, their, slaves, with, the, lowest, expense, possible, since, they, were, probably, going, to, die, of, yellow, fever, anyway, the, death, rate, was, so, high, that, polyandry, one, woman, being, married, to, several, men, at, the, same, time, developed, as, a, common, form, of, marriage, among, the, slaves, as, slaves, had, no, legal, rights, rape, by, planters, their, unmarried, sons, or, overseers, was, a, common, occurrence, on, the, plantations, the, largest, sugar, plantations, and, concentrations, of, slaves, were, in, the, north, of, the, island, and, whites, lived, in, fear, of, slave, rebellion, even, by, the, standards, of, the, caribbean, french, slave, masters, were, extremely, cruel, in, their, treatment, of, slaves, they, used, the, threat, and, acts, of, physical, violence, to, maintain, control, and, suppress, efforts, at, rebellion, when, slaves, left, the, plantations, or, disobeyed, their, masters, they, were, subject, to, whipping, or, to, more, extreme, torture, such, as, castration, or, burning, the, punishment, being, both, a, personal, lesson, and, a, warning, for, other, slaves, king, louis, xiv, of, france, passed, the, code, noir, in, 1685, in, an, attempt, to, regulate, such, violence, and, the, treatment, of, slaves, in, general, in, the, colony, but, masters, openly, and, consistently, broke, the, code, during, the, 18th, century, local, legislation, reversed, parts, of, it, in, 1758, the, planters, began, passing, legislation, restricting, the, rights, of, other, groups, of, people, until, a, rigid, caste, system, was, defined, most, historians, classify, the, people, of, the, era, into, three, groups, the, first, group, were, white, colonists, or, les, blancs, this, group, was, generally, subdivided, into, the, plantation, owners, and, a, lower, class, of, whites, who, often, served, as, overseers, or, day, laborers, as, well, as, artisans, and, shopkeepers, the, second, group, were, free, people, of, color, or, gens, de, couleur, libres, who, were, usually, mixed, race, sometimes, referred, to, as, mulattoes, being, of, both, african, and, french, descent, these, gens, de, couleur, tended, to, be, educated, and, literate, and, the, men, often, served, in, the, army, or, as, administrators, on, plantations, many, were, children, of, white, planters, and, enslaved, mothers, or, free, women, of, color, others, had, purchased, their, freedom, from, their, owners, through, the, sale, of, their, own, produce, or, artistic, works, they, often, received, education, or, artisan, training, and, sometimes, inherited, freedom, or, property, from, their, fathers, some, gens, de, couleur, owned, and, operated, their, own, plantations, and, became, slave, owners, the, third, group, outnumbering, the, others, by, a, ratio, of, ten, to, one, was, made, up, of, mostly, african, born, slaves, a, high, rate, of, mortality, among, them, meant, that, planters, continually, had, to, import, new, slaves, this, kept, their, culture, more, african, and, separate, from, other, people, on, the, island, many, plantations, had, large, concentrations, of, slaves, from, a, particular, region, of, africa, and, it, was, therefore, somewhat, easier, for, these, groups, to, maintain, elements, of, their, culture, religion, and, language, this, also, separated, new, slaves, from, africa, from, creoles, slaves, born, in, the, colony, who, already, had, kin, networks, and, often, had, more, prestigious, roles, on, plantations, and, more, opportunities, for, emancipation, most, slaves, spoke, a, patois, of, the, french, language, known, as, haitian, creole, which, was, also, used, by, island, born, mulattoes, and, whites, for, communication, with, the, workers, the, majority, of, the, slaves, were, yoruba, from, what, is, now, modern, nigeria, fon, from, what, is, now, benin, and, kongo, from, the, kingdom, of, kongo, in, what, is, now, modern, northern, angola, and, the, western, congo, the, kongolese, at, 40, were, the, largest, of, the, african, ethnic, groups, represented, amongst, the, slaves, the, slaves, developed, their, own, religion, a, syncretic, mixture, of, catholicism, and, west, african, religions, known, as, vodou, usually, called, voodoo, in, english, this, belief, system, implicitly, rejected, the, africans, status, as, slaves, saint, domingue, was, a, society, seething, with, hatred, with, white, colonists, and, black, slaves, frequently, coming, into, violent, conflict, the, french, historian, paul, fregosi, wrote, whites, mulattos, and, blacks, loathed, each, other, the, poor, whites, couldn, t, stand, the, rich, whites, the, rich, whites, despised, the, poor, whites, the, middle, class, whites, were, jealous, of, the, aristocratic, whites, the, whites, born, in, france, looked, down, upon, the, locally, born, whites, mulattoes, envied, the, whites, despised, the, blacks, and, were, despised, by, the, whites, free, negroes, brutalized, those, who, were, still, slaves, haitian, born, blacks, regarded, those, from, africa, as, savages, everyone, quite, rightly, lived, in, terror, of, everyone, else, haiti, was, hell, but, haiti, was, rich, many, of, these, conflicts, involved, slaves, who, had, escaped, the, plantations, many, runaway, slaves, called, maroons, hid, on, the, margins, of, large, plantations, living, off, the, land, and, what, they, could, steal, from, their, former, masters, others, fled, to, towns, to, blend, in, with, urban, slaves, and, freed, blacks, who, often, migrated, to, those, areas, for, work, if, caught, these, runaway, slaves, would, be, severely, and, violently, punished, however, some, masters, tolerated, petit, marronages, or, short, term, absences, from, plantations, knowing, these, allowed, release, of, tensions, the, larger, groups, of, runaway, slaves, who, lived, in, the, hillside, woods, away, from, white, control, often, conducted, violent, raids, on, the, island, s, sugar, and, coffee, plantations, although, the, numbers, in, these, bands, grew, large, sometimes, into, the, thousands, they, generally, lacked, the, leadership, and, strategy, to, accomplish, large, scale, objectives, the, first, effective, maroon, leader, to, emerge, was, the, charismatic, haitian, vodou, priest, fran, ois, mackandal, who, inspired, his, people, by, drawing, on, african, traditions, and, religions, he, united, the, maroon, bands, and, established, a, network, of, secret, organizations, among, plantation, slaves, leading, a, rebellion, from, 1751, through, 1757, although, mackandal, was, captured, by, the, french, and, burned, at, the, stake, in, 1758, large, armed, maroon, bands, persisted, in, raids, and, harassment, after, his, death, french, writer, guillaume, raynal, attacked, slavery, in, his, history, of, european, colonization, he, warned, the, africans, only, want, a, chief, sufficiently, courageous, to, lead, them, on, to, vengeance, and, slaughter, raynal, s, enlightenment, philosophy, went, deeper, than, a, prediction, and, reflected, many, similar, philosophies, including, those, of, rousseau, and, diderot, raynal, s, admonition, was, written, thirteen, years, before, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, which, highlighted, freedom, and, liberty, but, did, not, abolish, slavery, in, addition, to, raynal, s, influence, toussaint, louverture, a, free, black, who, was, familiar, with, enlightenment, ideas, within, the, context, of, european, colonialism, would, become, a, key, enlightened, actor, in, the, haitian, revolution, enlightened, thought, divided, the, world, into, enlightened, leaders, and, ignorant, masses, louverture, sought, to, bridge, this, divide, between, the, popular, masses, and, the, enlightened, few, by, striking, a, balance, between, western, enlightened, thought, as, a, necessary, means, of, winning, liberation, and, not, propagating, the, notion, that, it, was, morally, superior, to, the, experiences, and, knowledge, of, people, of, color, on, saint, domingue, louverture, wrote, a, constitution, for, a, new, society, in, saint, domingue, that, abolished, slavery, the, existence, of, slavery, in, enlightened, society, was, an, incongruity, that, had, been, left, unaddressed, by, european, scholars, prior, to, the, french, revolution, louverture, took, on, this, inconsistency, directly, in, his, constitution, in, addition, he, exhibited, a, connection, to, enlightenment, scholars, through, the, style, language, and, accent, of, this, text, like, louverture, jean, baptiste, belley, was, an, active, participant, in, the, insurrection, the, portrait, of, belley, by, anne, louis, girodet, de, roussy, trioson, depicts, a, man, who, encompasses, the, french, view, of, its, colonies, creating, a, stark, dichotomy, between, the, refinement, of, enlightenment, thought, and, the, reality, of, the, situation, in, saint, domingue, through, the, bust, of, raynal, and, the, figure, of, belley, respectively, while, distinguished, the, portrait, still, portrays, a, man, trapped, by, the, confines, of, race, girodet, s, portrayal, of, the, former, national, convention, deputy, is, telling, of, the, french, opinion, of, colonial, citizens, by, emphasizing, the, subject, s, sexuality, and, including, an, earring, both, of, these, racially, charged, symbols, reveal, the, desire, to, undermine, the, colony, s, attempts, at, independent, legitimacy, as, citizens, of, the, colonies, were, not, able, to, access, the, elite, class, of, french, revolutionaries, because, of, their, race, in, 1789, saint, domingue, produced, 60, of, the, world, s, coffee, and, 40, of, the, sugar, imported, by, france, and, britain, the, colony, was, not, only, the, most, profitable, possession, of, the, french, colonial, empire, but, it, was, the, wealthiest, and, most, prosperous, colony, in, the, caribbean, the, colony, s, white, population, numbered, 40, 000, mulattoes, and, free, blacks, 28, 000, and, black, slaves, an, estimated, 452, 000, this, was, almost, half, the, total, slave, population, in, the, caribbean, estimated, at, one, million, that, year, enslaved, blacks, regarded, as, the, lowest, class, of, colonial, society, outnumbered, whites, and, free, people, of, color, by, a, margin, of, almost, eight, to, one, two, thirds, of, the, slaves, were, african, born, and, they, tended, to, be, less, submissive, than, those, born, in, the, americas, and, raised, in, slave, societies, the, death, rate, in, the, caribbean, exceeded, the, birth, rate, so, imports, of, enslaved, africans, were, necessary, to, maintain, the, numbers, required, to, work, the, plantations, the, slave, population, declined, at, an, annual, rate, of, two, to, five, percent, due, to, overwork, inadequate, food, and, shelter, insufficient, clothing, and, medical, care, and, an, imbalance, between, the, sexes, with, more, men, than, women, some, slaves, were, of, a, creole, elite, class, of, urban, slaves, and, domestics, who, worked, as, cooks, personal, servants, and, artisans, around, the, plantation, house, this, relatively, privileged, class, was, chiefly, born, in, the, americas, while, the, under, class, born, in, africa, labored, hard, and, often, under, abusive, and, brutal, conditions, among, saint, domingue, s, 40, 000, white, colonists, european, born, frenchmen, monopolized, administrative, posts, the, sugar, planters, or, grands, blancs, literally, big, whites, were, chiefly, minor, aristocrats, most, returned, to, france, as, soon, as, possible, hoping, to, avoid, the, dreaded, yellow, fever, which, regularly, swept, the, colony, the, lower, class, whites, petits, blancs, literally, small, whites, included, artisans, shopkeepers, slave, dealers, overseers, and, day, laborers, saint, domingue, s, free, people, of, color, or, gens, de, couleur, libres, numbered, more, than, 28, 000, around, that, time, colonial, legislations, concerned, with, this, growing, and, strengthening, population, passed, discriminatory, laws, that, required, these, freedmen, to, wear, distinctive, clothing, and, limited, where, they, could, live, these, laws, also, barred, them, from, occupying, many, public, offices, many, freedmen, were, also, artisans, and, overseers, or, domestic, servants, in, the, plantation, houses, le, cap, fran, ais, le, cap, a, northern, port, had, a, large, population, of, free, people, of, color, including, freed, slaves, these, men, would, become, important, leaders, in, the, slave, rebellion, and, later, revolution, saint, domingue, s, northern, province, was, the, center, of, shipping, and, trading, and, had, the, largest, population, of, grands, blancs, the, plaine, du, nord, on, the, northern, shore, of, saint, domingue, was, the, most, fertile, area, having, the, largest, sugar, plantations, and, therefore, the, most, slaves, it, was, the, area, of, greatest, economic, importance, especially, as, most, of, the, colony, s, trade, went, through, these, ports, the, largest, and, busiest, port, was, le, cap, the, former, capital, of, saint, domingue, enslaved, africans, in, this, region, lived, in, large, groups, of, workers, in, relative, isolation, separated, from, the, rest, of, the, colony, by, the, high, mountain, range, known, as, the, massif, du, nord, the, western, province, however, grew, significantly, after, the, colonial, capital, was, moved, to, port, au, prince, in, 1751, becoming, increasingly, wealthy, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, southern, province, lagged, in, population, and, wealth, because, it, was, geographically, separated, from, the, rest, of, the, colony, however, this, isolation, allowed, freed, slaves, to, find, profit, in, trade, with, jamaica, and, they, gained, power, and, wealth, here, in, addition, to, these, interregional, tensions, there, were, conflicts, between, proponents, of, independence, those, loyal, to, france, and, allies, of, britain, and, spain, who, coveted, control, of, the, valuable, colony, after, the, establishment, of, the, french, first, republic, the, national, assembly, made, radical, changes, to, french, laws, and, on, 26, august, 1789, published, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, declaring, all, men, free, and, equal, the, declaration, was, ambiguous, as, to, whether, this, equality, applied, to, women, slaves, or, citizens, of, the, colonies, and, thus, influenced, the, desire, for, freedom, and, equality, in, saint, domingue, white, planters, saw, it, as, an, opportunity, to, gain, independence, from, france, which, would, allow, them, to, take, control, of, the, island, and, create, trade, regulations, that, would, further, their, own, wealth, and, power, however, the, haitian, revolution, quickly, became, a, test, of, the, new, french, republic, as, it, radicalized, the, slavery, question, and, forced, french, leaders, to, recognize, the, full, meaning, of, their, stated, ideology, the, african, population, on, the, island, began, to, hear, of, the, agitation, for, independence, by, the, planters, who, had, resented, france, s, limitations, on, the, island, s, foreign, trade, the, africans, mostly, allied, with, the, royalists, and, the, british, as, they, understood, that, if, saint, domingue, s, independence, were, to, be, led, by, white, slave, masters, it, would, probably, mean, even, harsher, treatment, and, increased, injustice, for, the, african, population, the, planters, would, be, free, to, operate, slavery, as, they, pleased, without, the, existing, minimal, accountability, to, their, french, peers, saint, domingue, s, free, people, of, color, most, notably, julien, raimond, had, been, actively, appealing, to, france, for, full, civil, equality, with, whites, since, the, 1780s, raimond, used, the, french, revolution, to, make, this, the, major, colonial, issue, before, the, national, assembly, in, october, 1790, another, wealthy, free, man, of, color, vincent, og, demanded, the, right, to, vote, under, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, when, the, colonial, governor, refused, og, led, a, brief, 300, man, insurgency, in, the, area, around, le, cap, fighting, to, end, racial, discrimination, in, the, area, he, was, captured, in, early, 1791, and, brutally, executed, by, being, broken, on, the, wheel, before, being, beheaded, while, og, was, not, fighting, against, slavery, his, treatment, was, cited, by, later, slave, rebels, as, one, of, the, factors, in, their, decision, to, rise, up, in, august, 1791, and, resist, treaties, with, the, colonists, the, conflict, up, to, this, point, was, between, factions, of, whites, and, between, whites, and, free, blacks, enslaved, blacks, watched, from, the, sidelines, leading, 18th, century, french, writer, count, mirabeau, had, once, said, the, saint, domingue, whites, slept, at, the, foot, of, vesuvius, suggesting, the, grave, threat, they, faced, should, the, majority, of, slaves,

raynal, attacked, slavery, in, the, 1780, edition, of, his, history, of, european, colonization, he, also, predicted, a, general, slave, revolt, in, the, colonies, saying, that, there, were, signs, of, the, impending, storm, one, such, sign, was, the, action, of, the, french, revolutionary, government, to, grant, citizenship, to, wealthy, free, people, of, color, in, may, 1791, since, white, planters, refused, to, comply, with, this, decision, within, two, months, isolated, fighting, broke, out, between, the, former, slaves, and, the, whites, this, added, to, the, tense, climate, between, slaves, and, grands, blancs, raynal, s, prediction, came, true, on, the, night, of, 21, august, 1791, when, the, slaves, of, saint, domingue, rose, in, revolt, thousands, of, slaves, attended, a, secret, vodou, ceremony, as, a, tropical, storm, came, in, the, lightning, and, the, thunder, were, taken, as, auspicious, omens, and, later, that, night, the, slaves, began, to, kill, their, masters, and, plunged, the, colony, into, civil, war, the, signal, to, begin, the, revolt, had, been, given, by, dutty, boukman, a, high, priest, of, vodou, and, leader, of, the, maroon, slaves, and, cecile, fatiman, during, a, religious, ceremony, at, bois, ca, man, on, the, night, of, 14, august, within, the, next, ten, days, slaves, had, taken, control, of, the, entire, northern, province, in, an, unprecedented, slave, revolt, whites, kept, control, of, only, a, few, isolated, fortified, camps, the, slaves, sought, revenge, on, their, masters, through, pillage, rape, torture, mutilation, and, death, the, long, years, of, oppression, by, the, planters, had, left, many, blacks, with, a, hatred, of, all, whites, and, the, revolt, was, marked, by, extreme, violence, from, the, very, start, the, masters, and, mistresses, were, dragged, from, their, beds, to, be, killed, and, the, heads, of, french, children, were, placed, on, pikes, that, were, carried, at, the, front, of, the, rebel, columns, in, the, south, beginning, in, september, thirteen, thousand, slaves, and, rebels, led, by, romaine, la, proph, tesse, based, in, trou, coffy, took, supplies, from, and, burned, plantations, freed, slaves, and, occupied, and, burned, the, area, s, two, major, cities, l, og, ne, and, jacmel, the, planters, had, long, feared, such, a, revolt, and, were, well, armed, with, some, defensive, preparations, but, within, weeks, the, number, of, slaves, who, joined, the, revolt, in, the, north, reached, 100, 000, within, the, next, two, months, as, the, violence, escalated, the, slaves, killed, 4, 000, whites, and, burned, or, destroyed, 180, sugar, plantations, and, hundreds, of, coffee, and, indigo, plantations, at, least, 900, coffee, plantations, were, destroyed, and, the, total, damage, inflicted, over, the, next, two, weeks, amounted, to, 2, million, francs, in, september, 1791, the, surviving, whites, organized, into, militias, and, struck, back, killing, about, 15, 000, blacks, though, demanding, freedom, from, slavery, the, rebels, did, not, demand, independence, from, france, at, this, point, most, of, the, rebel, leaders, professed, to, be, fighting, for, the, king, of, france, who, they, believed, had, issued, a, decree, freeing, the, slaves, which, had, been, suppressed, by, the, colonial, governor, as, such, they, were, demanding, their, rights, as, frenchmen, which, had, been, granted, by, the, king, by, 1792, slave, rebels, controlled, a, third, of, saint, domingue, the, success, of, the, rebellion, caused, the, national, assembly, to, realize, it, was, facing, an, ominous, situation, the, assembly, granted, civil, and, political, rights, to, free, men, of, color, in, the, colonies, in, march, 1792, countries, throughout, europe, as, well, as, the, united, states, were, shocked, by, the, decision, but, the, assembly, was, determined, to, stop, the, revolt, apart, from, granting, rights, to, free, people, of, color, the, assembly, dispatched, 6, 000, french, soldiers, to, the, island, a, new, governor, sent, by, paris, l, ger, f, licit, sonthonax, abolished, slavery, in, the, northern, province, and, had, hostile, relations, with, the, planters, whom, he, saw, as, royalists, the, same, month, a, coalition, of, whites, and, conservative, free, blacks, and, forces, under, french, commissaire, nationale, edmond, de, saint, l, ger, put, down, the, trou, coffy, uprising, in, the, south, after, andr, rigaud, then, based, near, port, au, prince, declined, to, ally, with, them, meanwhile, in, 1793, france, declared, war, on, great, britain, the, grands, blancs, in, saint, domingue, unhappy, with, sonthonax, arranged, with, britain, to, declare, british, sovereignty, over, the, colony, believing, that, the, british, would, maintain, slavery, the, british, prime, minister, william, pitt, the, younger, believed, that, the, success, of, the, slave, revolt, in, saint, domingue, would, inspire, insurrections, in, the, british, caribbean, colonies, he, further, thought, that, taking, saint, domingue, the, richest, of, the, french, colonies, would, be, a, useful, bargaining, chip, in, eventual, peace, negotiations, with, france, and, in, the, interim, occupying, saint, domingue, would, mean, diverting, its, great, wealth, into, the, british, treasury, henry, dundas, 1st, viscount, melville, who, was, pitt, s, secretary, of, state, for, war, instructed, sir, adam, williamson, the, lieutenant, governor, of, the, colony, of, jamaica, to, sign, an, agreement, with, representatives, of, the, french, colonists, that, promised, to, restore, the, ancien, r, gime, slavery, and, discrimination, against, mixed, race, colonists, a, move, that, drew, criticism, from, abolitionists, william, wilberforce, and, thomas, clarkson, the, troops, who, came, to, saint, domingue, from, britain, had, an, extremely, low, survival, rate, often, dying, to, diseases, such, as, yellow, fever, the, british, government, would, send, less, trained, adolescents, to, maintain, strong, regiments, the, incompetence, of, the, new, soldiers, combined, with, the, ravaging, of, disease, upon, the, army, led, to, a, very, unsuccessful, campaign, in, saint, domingue, the, american, journalist, james, perry, notes, that, the, great, irony, of, the, british, campaign, in, saint, domingue, was, that, it, ended, as, a, complete, debacle, costing, the, british, treasury, millions, of, pounds, and, the, british, military, thousands, upon, thousands, of, dead, all, for, nothing, spain, which, controlled, the, rest, of, the, island, of, hispaniola, santo, domingo, also, joined, the, conflict, and, fought, with, britain, against, france, the, proportion, of, slaves, was, not, as, high, in, the, spanish, portion, of, the, island, spanish, forces, invaded, saint, domingue, and, were, joined, by, the, rebels, for, most, of, the, conflict, the, british, and, spanish, supplied, the, rebels, with, food, ammunition, arms, medicine, naval, support, and, military, advisors, by, august, 1793, there, were, only, 3, 500, french, soldiers, on, the, island, on, 20, september, 1793, about, 600, british, soldiers, from, jamaica, landed, at, j, r, mie, to, be, greeted, with, shouts, of, vivent, les, anglais, from, the, french, population, on, 22, september, 1793, mole, st, nicolas, the, main, french, naval, base, in, saint, domingue, surrendered, to, the, royal, navy, peacefully, however, everywhere, the, british, went, they, restored, slavery, which, made, them, hated, by, the, mass, of, common, people, to, prevent, military, disaster, and, secure, the, colony, for, republican, france, as, opposed, to, britain, spain, and, french, royalists, separately, or, in, combination, the, french, commissioners, sonthonax, and, tienne, polverel, offered, freedom, to, the, slaves, who, would, agree, to, fight, alongside, them, then, under, pressure, they, gradually, emancipated, all, the, slaves, of, the, colony, on, 29, august, 1793, sonthonax, proclaimed, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, northern, province, on, 31, october, tienne, polverel, did, the, same, in, the, other, two, western, and, southern, provinces, sonthonax, sent, three, of, his, deputies, namely, the, colonist, louis, duffay, the, free, black, army, officer, jean, baptiste, belley, and, a, free, man, of, color, jean, baptiste, mills, to, seek, the, national, convention, s, endorsement, for, the, emancipation, of, slaves, near, the, end, of, january, 1794, on, 4, february, dufay, gave, a, speech, to, the, convention, arguing, that, abolishing, slavery, was, the, only, way, to, keep, the, colony, in, control, of, the, french, and, that, former, slaves, would, willingly, work, to, restore, the, colony, the, convention, deputies, agreed, and, made, the, dramatic, decree, that, slavery, of, the, blacks, is, abolished, in, all, the, colonies, consequently, it, decrees, that, all, men, living, in, the, colonies, without, distinction, of, color, are, french, citizens, and, enjoy, all, the, rights, guaranteed, by, the, constitution, the, national, convention, abolished, slavery, by, law, in, france, and, all, its, colonies, and, granted, civil, and, political, rights, to, all, black, men, in, the, colonies, the, french, constitutions, of, 1793, and, 1795, both, included, the, abolition, of, slavery, the, constitution, of, 1793, never, went, into, effect, but, that, of, 1795, did, it, lasted, until, it, was, replaced, by, the, consular, and, imperial, constitutions, under, napoleon, bonaparte, despite, racial, tensions, in, saint, domingue, the, french, revolutionary, government, at, the, time, welcomed, abolition, with, a, show, of, idealism, and, optimism, the, emancipation, of, slaves, was, viewed, as, an, example, of, liberty, for, other, countries, much, as, the, american, revolution, was, meant, to, serve, as, the, first, of, many, liberation, movements, georges, danton, one, of, the, frenchmen, present, at, the, meeting, of, the, national, convention, expressed, this, sentiment, representatives, of, the, french, people, until, now, our, decrees, of, liberty, have, been, selfish, and, only, for, ourselves, but, today, we, proclaim, it, to, the, universe, and, generations, to, come, will, glory, in, this, decree, we, are, proclaiming, universal, liberty, we, are, working, for, future, generations, let, us, launch, liberty, into, the, colonies, the, english, are, dead, today, in, nationalistic, terms, the, abolition, of, slavery, also, served, as, a, moral, triumph, of, france, over, england, as, seen, in, the, latter, half, of, the, above, quote, yet, toussaint, louverture, did, not, stop, working, with, the, spanish, army, until, sometime, later, as, he, was, suspicious, of, the, french, the, british, force, that, landed, in, saint, domingue, in, 1793, was, too, small, to, conquer, the, colony, being, capable, only, of, holding, only, few, coastal, enclaves, the, french, planters, were, disappointed, as, they, had, hoped, to, regain, power, sonthonax, was, relieved, as, he, had, twice, refused, ultimatums, from, commodore, john, ford, to, surrender, port, au, prince, in, the, meantime, a, spanish, force, under, captain, general, joaqu, n, garc, a, y, moreno, had, marched, into, the, northern, province, louverture, the, ablest, of, the, haitian, generals, had, joined, the, spanish, accepting, an, officer, s, commission, in, the, spanish, army, and, being, made, a, knight, in, the, order, of, st, isabella, the, main, british, force, for, the, conquest, of, saint, domingue, under, general, charles, grey, nicknamed, no, flint, grey, and, admiral, sir, john, jervis, set, sail, from, portsmouth, on, 26, november, 1793, which, was, in, defiance, of, the, well, known, rule, that, the, only, time, that, one, could, campaign, in, the, west, indies, was, from, september, to, november, when, the, mosquitoes, that, carried, malaria, and, yellow, fever, were, scarce, after, arriving, in, the, west, indies, in, february, 1794, grey, chose, to, conquer, martinique, saint, lucia, and, guadeloupe, troops, under, the, command, of, john, whyte, did, not, arrive, in, saint, domingue, until, 19, may, 1794, rather, than, attacking, the, main, french, bases, at, le, cap, and, port, de, paix, whyte, chose, to, march, towards, port, au, prince, whose, harbour, was, reported, to, have, forty, five, ships, loaded, with, sugar, whyte, took, port, au, prince, but, sonthonax, and, the, french, forces, were, allowed, to, leave, in, exchange, for, not, burning, the, sugar, loaded, ships, by, may, 1794, the, french, forces, were, severed, in, two, by, toussaint, with, sonthonax, commanding, in, the, north, and, andr, rigaud, leading, in, the, south, in, may, 1794, toussaint, suddenly, joined, the, french, and, turned, against, the, spanish, ambushing, his, allies, as, they, emerged, from, attending, mass, in, a, church, at, san, raphael, on, 6, may, 1794, the, haitians, soon, expelled, the, spanish, from, saint, domingue, toussaint, proved, to, be, forgiving, of, the, whites, insisting, that, he, was, fighting, to, assert, the, rights, of, the, slaves, as, black, french, people, to, be, free, he, said, he, did, not, seek, independence, from, france, and, urged, the, surviving, whites, including, the, former, slave, masters, to, stay, and, work, with, him, in, rebuilding, saint, domingue, rigaud, had, checked, the, british, in, the, south, taking, the, town, of, l, og, ne, by, storm, and, driving, the, british, back, to, port, au, prince, during, the, course, of, 1794, most, of, the, british, forces, were, killed, by, yellow, fever, the, dreaded, black, vomit, as, the, british, called, it, within, two, months, of, arriving, in, saint, domingue, the, british, lost, 40, officers, and, 600, men, to, yellow, fever, of, grey, s, 7, 000, men, about, 5, 000, died, of, yellow, fever, while, the, royal, navy, reported, losing, forty, six, masters, and, eleven, hundred, men, dead, chiefly, of, yellow, fever, the, british, historian, sir, john, fortescue, wrote, it, is, probably, beneath, the, mark, to, say, that, twelve, thousand, englishmen, were, buried, in, the, west, indies, in, 1794, rigaud, failed, in, attempt, to, retake, port, au, prince, but, on, christmas, day, 1794, he, stormed, and, retook, tiburon, in, a, surprise, attack, the, british, lost, about, 300, soldiers, and, rigaud, s, forces, took, no, prisoners, executing, any, british, soldier, or, sailor, who, surrendered, at, this, point, pitt, decided, to, launch, what, he, called, the, great, push, to, conquer, saint, domingue, and, the, rest, of, the, french, west, indies, sending, out, the, largest, expedition, britain, had, yet, mounted, in, its, history, a, force, of, about, 30, 000, men, to, be, carried, in, 200, ships, fortescue, wrote, that, the, aim, of, the, british, in, the, first, expedition, had, been, to, destroy, the, power, of, france, in, these, pestilent, islands, only, to, discover, when, it, was, too, late, that, they, practically, destroyed, the, british, army, by, this, point, it, was, well, known, that, service, in, the, west, indies, was, virtually, a, death, sentence, in, dublin, and, cork, soldiers, from, the, 104th, 105th, 111th, and, 112th, regiments, rioted, when, they, learned, that, they, were, being, sent, to, saint, domingue, the, fleet, for, the, great, push, left, portsmouth, on, 16, november, 1795, and, was, wrecked, by, a, storm, before, sending, out, again, on, 9, december, the, overall, forces, in, st, domingue, was, at, that, time, under, the, command, of, the, lieutenant, governor, of, jamaica, sir, adam, williamson, he, was, optimistically, given, the, title, governor, of, st, domingue, and, among, his, british, forces, were, jamaican, black, shot, militias, general, ralph, abercromby, the, commander, of, the, forces, committed, to, the, great, push, hesitated, over, which, island, to, attack, when, he, arrived, in, barbados, on, 17, march, 1796, he, dispatched, a, force, under, major, general, gordon, forbes, to, port, au, prince, forbes, s, attempt, to, take, the, french, held, city, of, l, og, ne, ended, in, disaster, the, french, had, built, a, deep, defensive, ditch, with, palisades, and, forbes, had, neglected, to, bring, along, heavy, artillery, the, french, commander, the, mulatto, general, alexandre, p, tion, proved, to, be, an, excellent, artilleryman, who, used, the, guns, of, his, fort, to, sink, two, of, the, three, ships, of, the, line, under, admiral, hyde, parker, in, the, harbour, before, turning, his, guns, to, the, british, forces, a, french, sortie, led, to, a, rout, of, the, british, and, forbes, retreated, back, to, port, au, prince, as, more, ships, arrived, with, british, troops, more, soldiers, died, of, yellow, fever, by, 1, june, 1796, of, the, 1, 000, from, the, 66th, regiment, only, 198, had, not, been, infected, with, yellow, fever, and, of, the, 1, 000, men, of, the, 69th, regiment, only, 515, were, not, infected, with, yellow, fever, abercromby, predicted, that, at, the, current, rate, of, yellow, fever, infection, all, of, the, men, from, the, two, regiments, were, dead, by, november, ultimately, 10, 000, british, soldiers, arrived, in, saint, domingue, by, june, but, aside, from, some, skirmishing, near, bombarde, the, british, remained, in, port, au, prince, and, other, coastal, enclaves, while, yellow, fever, continued, to, kill, them, all, off, the, government, attracted, criticism, in, the, house, of, commons, about, the, mounting, costs, of, the, expedition, to, saint, domingue, in, february, 1797, general, john, graves, simcoe, arrived, to, replace, forbes, with, orders, to, pull, back, the, british, forces, to, port, au, prince, as, the, human, and, financial, costs, of, the, expedition, mounted, people, in, britain, demanded, a, withdrawal, from, saint, domingue, which, was, devouring, money, and, soldiers, while, failing, to, produce, the, expected, profits, on, 11, april, 1797, colonel, thomas, maitland, of, the, 62nd, regiment, of, foot, landed, in, port, au, prince, and, wrote, in, a, letter, to, his, brother, that, british, forces, in, saint, domingue, had, been, annihilated, by, the, yellow, fever, service, in, saint, domingue, was, extremely, unpopular, in, the, british, army, owing, to, the, terrible, death, toll, caused, by, yellow, fever, one, british, officer, wrote, of, his, horror, of, seeing, his, friends, drowned, in, their, own, blood, while, some, died, raving, mad, simcoe, used, the, new, british, troops, to, push, back, the, haitians, under, toussaint, but, in, a, counter, offensive, toussaint, and, rigaud, stopped, the, offensive, toussaint, retook, the, fortress, at, mirebalais, on, 7, june, 1797, toussaint, attacked, fort, churchill, in, an, assault, that, was, as, noted, for, its, professionalism, as, for, its, ferocity, under, a, storm, of, artillery, the, haitians, placed, ladders, on, the, walls, and, were, driven, back, four, times, with, heavy, losses, even, though, toussaint, had, been, repulsed, the, british, were, astonished, that, he, had, turned, a, group, of, former, slaves, with, no, military, experience, into, troops, whose, skills, were, the, equal, of, a, european, army, in, july, 1797, simcoe, and, maitland, sailed, to, london, to, advise, a, total, withdrawal, from, saint, domingue, in, march, 1798, maitland, returned, with, a, mandate, to, withdraw, at, least, from, port, au, prince, on, 10, may, 1798, maitland, met, with, toussaint, to, agree, to, an, armistice, and, on, 18, may, the, british, left, port, au, prince, the, british, forces, were, reduced, to, only, holding, the, western, peninsular, towns, of, mole, st, nicholas, in, the, north, and, jeremie, in, the, south, the, new, governor, of, jamaica, alexander, lindsay, 6th, earl, of, balcarres, urged, maitland, not, to, withdraw, from, mole, st, nicholas, however, toussaint, sent, a, message, to, balcarres, warning, him, that, if, he, persisted, to, remember, that, jamaica, was, not, far, from, st, domingue, and, could, be, invaded, maitland, knew, that, his, forces, could, not, defeat, toussaint, and, that, he, had, to, take, action, to, protect, jamaica, from, invasion, british, morale, had, collapsed, with, the, news, that, toussaint, had, taken, port, au, prince, and, maitland, decided, to, abandon, all, of, saint, domingue, writing, that, the, expedition, had, become, such, a, complete, disaster, that, withdrawal, was, the, only, sensible, thing, to, do, even, though, he, did, not, have, the, authority, to, do, so, on, 31, august, maitland, and, toussaint, signed, an, agreement, whereby, in, exchange, for, the, british, pulling, out, of, all, of, saint, domingue, toussaint, promised, to, not, support, any, slave, revolts, in, jamaica, rigaud, took, control, of, jeremie, without, any, cost, to, his, forces, as, maitland, withdrew, his, southern, forces, to, jamaica, in, the, end, of, 1798, maitland, withdrew, the, last, of, his, forces, from, mole, st, nicholas, as, toussaint, took, command, of, the, fortress, maitland, disbanded, his, black, shot, troops, and, left, them, in, st, domingue, fearing, they, might, return, to, jamaica, and, start, a, revolution, to, overthrow, slavery, in, the, british, colony, many, of, them, joined, toussaint, s, army, after, the, departure, of, the, british, toussaint, turned, his, attention, to, rigaud, who, was, conspiring, against, him, in, the, south, of, saint, domingue, in, june, 1799, rigaud, initiated, the, war, of, knives, against, toussaint, s, rule, sending, a, brutal, offensive, at, petit, go, ve, and, grand, go, ve, taking, no, prisoners, rigaud, s, predominantly, mulatto, forces, put, blacks, and, whites, to, the, sword, though, the, united, states, was, hostile, towards, toussaint, the, u, s, navy, agreed, to, support, toussaint, s, forces, with, the, frigate, uss, general, greene, commanded, by, captain, christopher, perry, providing, fire, support, to, the, blacks, as, toussaint, laid, siege, to, the, city, of, jacmel, held, by, mulatto, forces, under, the, command, of, rigaud, to, the, united, states, rigaud, s, ties, to, france, represented, a, threat, to, american, commerce, on, 11, march, 1800, toussaint, took, jacmel, and, rigaud, fled, on, the, french, schooner, la, diana, though, toussaint, maintained, he, was, still, loyal, to, france, to, all, intents, and, purposes, he, ruled, saint, domingue, as, its, dictator, toussaint, louverture, although, a, self, educated, former, domestic, slave, was, one, of, the, most, successful, black, commanders, like, jean, fran, ois, and, biassou, he, initially, fought, for, the, spanish, crown, after, the, british, had, invaded, saint, domingue, louverture, decided, to, fight, for, the, french, if, they, would, agree, to, free, all, the, slaves, sonthonax, had, proclaimed, an, end, to, slavery, on, 29, august, 1792, louverture, worked, with, a, french, general, tienne, laveaux, to, ensure, that, all, slaves, would, be, freed, louverture, abandoned, the, spanish, army, in, the, east, and, brought, his, forces, over, to, the, french, side, on, 6, may, 1794, after, the, spanish, refused, to, take, steps, to, end, slavery, under, the, military, leadership, of, toussaint, the, former, slaves, succeeded, in, winning, concessions, from, the, british, and, expelled, the, spanish, forces, in, the, end, toussaint, essentially, restored, control, of, saint, domingue, to, france, having, made, himself, master, of, the, island, however, toussaint, did, not, wish, to, surrender, too, much, power, to, france, he, began, to, rule, the, country, as, an, effectively, autonomous, entity, louverture, overcame, a, succession, of, local, rivals, including, the, commissioner, sonthonax, a, french, white, man, who, gained, support, from, many, haitians, angering, louverture, andr, rigaud, a, free, man, of, color, who, fought, to, keep, control, of, the, south, in, the, war, of, knives, and, comte, d, h, douville, who, forced, a, fatal, wedge, between, rigaud, and, louverture, before, escaping, to, france, toussaint, defeated, a, british, expeditionary, force, in, 1798, in, addition, he, led, an, invasion, of, neighboring, santo, domingo, december, 1800, and, freed, the, slaves, there, on, 3, january, 1801, in, 1801, louverture, issued, a, constitution, for, saint, domingue, that, decreed, he, would, be, governor, for, life, and, called, for, black, autonomy, and, a, sovereign, black, state, in, response, napoleon, bonaparte, dispatched, a, large, expeditionary, force, of, french, soldiers, and, warships, to, the, island, led, by, bonaparte, s, brother, in, law, charles, leclerc, to, restore, french, rule, they, were, under, secret, instructions, to, restore, slavery, at, least, in, the, formerly, spanish, held, part, of, the, island, bonaparte, ordered, that, toussaint, was, to, be, treated, with, respect, until, the, french, forces, were, established, once, that, was, done, toussaint, was, to, be, summoned, to, le, cap, and, arrested, if, he, failed, to, show, leclerc, was, to, wage, a, war, to, the, death, with, no, mercy, and, all, of, toussaint, s, followers, to, be, shot, when, captured, once, that, was, completed, slavery, would, be, ultimately, restored, the, numerous, french, soldiers, were, accompanied, by, mulatto, troops, led, by, alexandre, p, tion, and, andr, rigaud, mulatto, leaders, who, had, been, defeated, by, toussaint, three, years, earlier, the, french, arrived, on, 2, february, 1802, at, le, cap, with, the, haitian, commander, henri, christophe, being, ordered, by, leclerc, to, turn, over, the, city, to, the, french, when, christophe, refused, the, french, assaulted, le, cap, and, the, haitians, set, the, city, afire, rather, than, surrender, it, leclerc, sent, toussaint, letters, promising, him, have, no, worries, about, your, personal, fortune, it, will, be, safeguarded, for, you, since, it, has, been, only, too, well, earned, by, your, own, efforts, do, not, worry, about, the, liberty, of, your, fellow, citizens, when, toussaint, still, failed, to, appear, at, le, cap, leclerc, issued, a, proclamation, on, 17, february, 1802, general, toussaint, and, general, christophe, are, outlawed, all, citizens, are, ordered, to, hunt, them, down, and, treat, them, as, rebels, against, the, french, republic, captain, marcus, rainsford, a, british, army, officer, who, visited, saint, domingue, observed, the, training, of, the, haitian, army, writing, at, a, whistle, a, whole, brigade, ran, three, or, four, hundred, yards, and, then, separating, threw, themselves, flat, on, the, ground, changing, to, their, backs, and, sides, and, all, the, time, keeping, up, a, strong, fire, until, recalled, this, movement, is, executed, with, such, facility, and, precision, as, totally, to, prevent, cavalry, from, charging, them, in, bushy, and, hilly, country, in, a, letter, to, jean, jacques, dessalines, toussaint, outlined, his, plans, for, defeating, the, french, using, scorched, earth, do, not, forget, while, waiting, for, the, rainy, reason, which, will, rid, us, of, our, foes, that, we, have, no, other, resource, than, destruction, and, fire, bear, in, mind, that, the, soil, bathed, with, our, sweat, must, not, furnish, our, enemies, with, the, smallest, sustenance, tear, up, the, roads, with, shot, throw, corpses, and, horses, into, all, the, foundations, burn, and, annihilate, everything, in, order, that, those, who, have, come, to, reduce, us, to, slavery, may, have, before, their, eyes, the, image, of, the, hell, which, they, deserve, dessalines, never, received, the, letter, as, he, had, already, taken, to, the, field, evaded, a, french, column, sent, to, capture, him, and, stormed, l, og, ne, the, haitians, burned, down, l, og, ne, and, killed, all, of, the, french, with, the, trinidadian, historian, c, l, r, james, writing, of, dessalines, s, actions, at, l, og, ne, men, women, and, children, indeed, all, the, whites, who, came, into, his, hands, he, massacred, and, forbidding, burial, he, left, stacks, of, corpses, rotting, in, the, sun, to, strike, terror, into, the, french, detachments, as, they, toiled, behind, his, flying, columns, the, french, had, been, expecting, the, haitians, to, happily, go, back, to, being, their, slaves, as, they, believed, it, was, natural, for, blacks, to, be, the, slaves, of, whites, and, were, stunned, to, learn, how, much, the, haitians, hated, them, for, wanting, to, reduce, them, back, to, a, life, in, chains, a, visibly, shocked, general, pamphile, de, lacroix, after, seeing, the, ruins, of, l, og, ne, wrote, they, heaped, up, bodies, which, still, had, their, attitudes, they, were, bent, over, their, hands, outstretched, and, beseeching, the, ice, of, death, had, not, effaced, the, look, on, their, faces, leclerc, ordered, four, french, columns, to, march, on, gonaives, which, was, the, main, haitian, base, one, of, the, french, columns, was, commanded, by, general, donatien, de, rochambeau, a, proud, white, supremacist, and, a, supporter, of, slavery, who, detested, the, haitians, for, wanting, to, be, free, toussaint, tried, to, stop, rochambeau, at, ravine, couleuvre, a, very, narrow, gully, up, in, the, mountains, that, the, haitians, had, filled, with, chopped, down, trees, in, the, ensuring, battle, of, ravine, couleuvres, after, six, hours, of, fierce, hand, to, hand, fighting, with, no, quarter, given, on, either, side, the, french, finally, broke, through, albeit, with, heavy, losses, during, the, battle, toussaint, personally, took, part, in, the, fighting, to, lead, his, men, in, charges, against, the, french, after, losing, 800, men, toussaint, ordered, a, retreat, the, haitians, next, tried, to, stop, the, french, at, a, british, built, fort, up, in, the, mountains, called, cr, te, pierrot, a, battle, that, is, remembered, as, a, national, epic, in, haiti, while, toussaint, took, to, the, field, he, left, dessalines, in, command, of, cr, te, pierrot, who, from, his, fastness, could, see, three, french, columns, converging, on, the, fort, dessalines, appeared, before, his, men, standing, atop, of, a, barrel, of, gunpowder, holding, a, lit, torch, saying, we, are, going, to, be, attacked, and, if, the, french, put, their, feet, in, here, i, shall, blow, everything, up, leading, his, men, to, reply, we, shall, die, for, liberty, the, first, of, the, french, columns, to, appear, before, the, fort, was, commanded, by, general, jean, boudet, whose, men, were, harassed, by, skirmishers, until, they, reached, a, deep, ditch, the, haitians, had, dug, as, the, french, tried, to, cross, the, ditch, dessalines, ordered, his, men, who, were, hiding, to, come, out, and, open, fire, hitting, the, french, with, a, tremendous, volley, of, artillery, and, musket, fire, inflicting, heavy, losses, on, the, attackers, general, boudet, himself, was, wounded, and, as, the, french, dead, and, wounded, started, to, pile, up, in, the, ditch, the, french, retreated, the, next, french, commander, who, tried, to, assault, the, ditch, was, general, charles, dugua, joined, shortly, afterwards, by, the, column, commanded, by, leclerc, all, of, the, french, assaults, ended, in, total, failure, and, after, the, failure, of, their, last, attack, the, haitians, charged, the, french, cutting, down, any, frenchmen, general, dugua, was, killed, leclerc, was, wounded, and, the, french, lost, about, 800, dead, the, final, french, column, to, arrive, was, the, one, commanded, by, rochambeau, who, brought, along, heavy, artillery, that, knocked, out, the, haitian, artillery, though, his, attempt, to, storm, the, ditch, also, ended, in, failure, with, about, 300, of, his, men, killed, over, the, following, days, the, french, kept, on, bombarding, and, assaulting, the, fort, only, to, be, repulsed, every, time, while, the, haitians, defiantly, sang, songs, of, the, french, revolution, celebrating, the, right, of, all, men, to, be, equal, and, free, the, haitian, psychological, warfare, was, successful, with, many, french, soldiers, asking, why, they, were, fighting, to, enslave, the, haitians, who, were, only, asserting, the, rights, promised, by, the, revolution, to, make, all, men, free, despite, bonaparte, s, attempt, to, keep, his, intention, to, restore, slavery, a, secret, it, was, widely, believed, by, both, sides, that, was, why, the, french, had, returned, to, haiti, as, a, sugar, plantation, could, only, be, profitable, with, slave, labour, finally, after, twenty, days, of, siege, with, food, and, ammunition, running, out, dessalines, ordered, his, men, to, abandon, the, fort, on, the, night, of, 24, march, 1802, and, the, haitians, slipped, out, of, the, fort, to, fight, another, day, even, rochambeau, who, hated, all, blacks, was, forced, to, admit, in, a, report, their, retreat, this, miraculous, retreat, from, our, trap, was, an, incredible, feat, of, arms, the, french, had, won, but, they, had, lost, 2, 000, dead, against, an, opponent, whom, they, held, in, contempt, on, racial, grounds, believing, all, blacks, to, be, stupid, and, cowardly, and, furthermore, that, it, was, shortages, of, food, and, ammunition, that, forced, the, haitians, to, retreat, not, because, of, any, feats, of, arms, by, the, french, army, after, the, battle, of, cr, te, pierrot, the, haitians, abandoned, conventional, warfare, and, reverted, to, guerrilla, tactics, making, the, french, hold, over, much, of, the, countryside, from, le, cap, down, to, the, artibonite, valley, very, tenuous, with, march, the, rainy, season, came, to, saint, domingue, and, as, stagnant, water, collected, the, mosquitoes, began, to, breed, leading, to, yet, another, outbreak, of, yellow, fever, by, the, end, of, march, 5, 000, french, soldiers, had, died, of, yellow, fever, and, another, 5, 000, were, hospitalized, with, yellow, fever, leading, to, a, worried, leclerc, to, write, in, his, diary, the, rainy, season, has, arrived, my, troops, are, exhausted, with, fatigue, and, sickness, on, 25, april, 1802, the, situation, suddenly, changed, when, christophe, defected, along, with, much, of, the, haitian, army, to, the, french, louverture, was, promised, his, freedom, if, he, agreed, to, integrate, his, remaining, troops, into, the, french, army, louverture, agreed, to, this, on, 6, may, 1802, just, what, motivated, toussaint, to, give, up, the, fight, has, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, with, most, probable, explanation, being, that, he, was, just, tired, after, 11, years, of, war, under, the, terms, of, surrender, leclerc, gave, his, solemn, word, that, slavery, would, not, be, restored, in, saint, domingue, that, blacks, could, be, officers, in, the, french, army, and, that, the, haitian, army, would, be, allowed, to, integrate, into, the, french, army, leclerc, also, gave, toussaint, a, plantation, at, ennery, toussaint, was, later, deceived, seized, by, the, french, and, shipped, to, france, he, died, months, later, in, prison, at, fort, de, joux, in, the, jura, mountains, shortly, afterwards, the, ferocious, dessalines, rode, into, le, cap, to, submit, to, france, and, was, rewarded, by, being, made, the, governor, of, saint, marc, a, place, that, dessalines, ruled, with, his, customary, cruelty, however, the, surrender, of, christophe, toussaint, and, dessalines, did, not, mean, the, end, of, haitian, resistance, throughout, the, countryside, guerrilla, warfare, continued, and, the, french, staged, mass, executions, via, firing, squads, hanging, and, drowning, haitians, in, bags, rochambeau, invented, a, new, means, of, mass, execution, which, he, called, fumigational, sulphurous, baths, killing, hundreds, of, haitians, in, the, holds, of, ships, by, burning, sulphur, to, make, sulphur, dioxide, to, gas, them, for, a, few, months, the, island, was, quiet, under, napoleonic, rule, but, when, it, became, apparent, that, the, french, intended, to, re, establish, slavery, because, they, had, nearly, done, so, on, guadeloupe, black, cultivators, revolted, in, the, summer, of, 1802, yellow, fever, had, decimated, the, french, by, the, middle, of, july, 1802, the, french, lost, about, 10, 000, dead, to, yellow, fever, by, september, leclerc, wrote, in, his, diary, that, he, had, only, 8, 000, fit, men, left, as, yellow, fever, had, killed, the, others, in, 1802, napoleon, added, a, polish, legion, of, around, 5, 200, to, the, forces, sent, to, saint, domingue, to, fight, off, the, slave, rebellion, however, the, poles, were, told, that, there, was, a, revolt, of, prisoners, in, saint, domingue, upon, arrival, and, the, first, fights, the, polish, soldiers, soon, discovered, that, what, was, actually, taking, place, in, the, colony, was, a, rebellion, of, slaves, fighting, off, their, french, masters, for, their, freedom, during, this, time, there, was, a, familiar, situation, going, on, back, in, their, homeland, as, these, polish, soldiers, were, fighting, for, their, liberty, from, the, occupying, forces, of, russia, prussia, and, austria, that, began, in, 1772, many, poles, believed, that, if, they, fought, for, france, bonaparte, would, reward, them, by, restoring, polish, independence, which, had, been, ended, with, the, third, partition, of, poland, in, 1795, as, hopeful, as, the, haitians, many, poles, were, seeking, union, amongst, themselves, to, win, back, their, freedom, and, independence, by, organizing, an, uprising, as, a, result, many, polish, soldiers, admired, their, opponents, to, eventually, turn, on, the, french, army, and, join, the, haitian, slaves, polish, soldiers, participated, in, the, haitian, revolution, of, 1804, contributing, to, the, establishment, of, the, world, s, first, free, black, republic, and, the, first, independent, caribbean, state, haiti, s, first, head, of, state, jean, jacques, dessalines, called, polish, people, the, white, negroes, of, europe, which, was, then, regarded, a, great, honor, as, it, meant, brotherhood, between, poles, and, haitians, many, years, later, fran, ois, duvalier, the, president, of, haiti, who, was, known, for, his, black, nationalist, and, pan, african, views, used, the, same, concept, of, european, white, negroes, while, referring, to, polish, people, and, glorifying, their, patriotism, after, haiti, gained, its, independence, the, poles, acquired, haitian, citizenship, for, their, loyalty, and, support, in, overthrowing, the, french, colonialists, and, were, called, black, by, the, haitian, constitution, dessalines, and, p, tion, remained, allied, with, france, until, they, switched, sides, again, in, october, 1802, and, fought, against, the, french, as, leclerc, lay, dying, of, yellow, fever, and, heard, that, christophe, and, dessalines, had, joined, the, rebels, he, reacted, by, ordering, all, of, the, blacks, living, in, le, cap, to, be, killed, by, drowning, in, the, harbour, in, november, leclerc, died, of, yellow, fever, like, much, of, his, army, his, successor, the, vicomte, de, rochambeau, fought, an, even, more, brutal, campaign, rochambeau, waged, a, near, genocidal, campaign, against, the, haitians, killing, everyone, who, was, black, rochambeau, imported, about, 15, 000, attack, dogs, from, jamaica, who, had, been, trained, to, savage, blacks, and, mulattoes, other, sources, suggest, the, dogs, may, have, been, dogo, cubanos, sourced, in, their, hundreds, from, cuba, rather, than, jamaica, at, the, bay, of, le, cap, rochambeau, had, blacks, drowned, no, one, would, eat, fish, from, the, bay, for, months, afterward, as, no, one, wished, to, eat, the, fish, that, had, eaten, human, flesh, bonaparte, hearing, that, most, of, his, army, in, saint, domingue, had, died, of, yellow, fever, and, the, french, held, only, port, au, prince, le, cap, and, les, cayes, sent, about, 20, 000, reinforcements, to, rochambeau, dessalines, matched, rochambeau, in, his, vicious, cruelty, at, le, cap, when, rochambeau, hanged, 500, blacks, dessalines, replied, by, killing, 500, whites, and, sticking, their, heads, on, spikes, all, around, le, cap, so, that, the, french, could, see, what, he, was, planning, on, doing, to, them, rochambeau, s, atrocities, helped, rally, many, former, french, loyalists, to, the, rebel, cause, many, on, both, sides, had, come, to, see, the, war, as, a, race, war, where, no, mercy, was, to, be, given, the, haitians, burned, french, prisoners, alive, cut, them, up, with, axes, or, tied, them, to, a, board, and, sawed, them, into, two, with, napoleon, s, inability, to, send, the, requested, massive, reinforcements, after, the, outbreak, of, war, on, 18, may, 1803, with, the, british, the, royal, navy, immediately, despatched, a, squadron, under, sir, john, duckworth, from, jamaica, to, cruise, in, the, region, seeking, to, eliminate, communication, between, the, french, outposts, and, to, capture, or, destroy, the, french, warships, based, in, the, colony, the, blockade, of, saint, domingue, not, only, cut, the, french, forces, out, from, reinforcements, and, supplies, from, france, but, also, meant, that, the, british, began, to, supply, arms, to, the, haitians, trapped, engaged, in, a, vicious, race, war, and, with, much, of, his, army, dying, of, yellow, fever, rochambeau, fell, to, pieces, he, lost, interest, in, commanding, his, army, and, as, james, wrote, he, amused, himself, with, sexual, pleasures, military, balls, banquets, and, the, amassing, of, a, personal, fortune, the, royal, navy, squadrons, soon, blockaded, the, french, held, ports, of, cap, fran, ais, and, m, le, saint, nicolas, on, the, northern, coast, of, the, french, colony, in, the, summer, of, 1803, when, war, broke, out, between, the, united, kingdom, and, the, french, consulate, saint, domingue, had, been, almost, completely, overrun, by, haitian, forces, under, the, command, of, jean, jacques, dessalines, in, the, north, of, the, country, the, french, forces, were, isolated, in, the, two, large, ports, of, cap, fran, ais, and, m, le, saint, nicolas, and, a, few, smaller, settlements, all, supplied, by, a, french, naval, force, based, primarily, at, cap, fran, ais, on, 28, june, the, squadron, encountered, a, french, convoy, from, les, cayes, off, m, le, saint, nicolas, capturing, one, ship, although, the, other, escaped, two, days, later, an, independently, sailing, french, frigate, was, chased, down, and, captured, in, the, same, waters, on, 24, july, another, british, squadron, intercepted, the, main, french, squadron, from, cap, fran, ais, which, was, attempting, to, break, past, the, blockade, and, reach, france, the, british, led, by, commodore, john, loring, gave, chase, but, one, french, ship, of, the, line, and, a, frigate, escaped, another, ship, of, the, line, was, trapped, against, the, coast, and, captured, after, coming, under, fire, from, haitian, shore, batteries, the, remainder, of, the, squadron, was, forced, to, fight, two, more, actions, on, their, return, to, europe, but, did, eventually, reach, the, spanish, port, of, corunna, on, 8, october, 1803, the, french, abandoned, port, au, prince, as, rochambeau, decided, to, concentrate, what, was, left, of, his, army, at, le, cap, dessalines, marched, into, port, au, prince, where, he, was, welcomed, as, a, hero, by, the, 100, whites, who, had, chosen, to, stay, behind, dessalines, thanked, them, all, for, their, kindness, and, belief, in, racial, equality, but, then, he, said, that, the, french, had, treated, him, as, less, than, human, when, he, was, a, slave, and, so, to, avenge, his, mistreatment, he, promptly, had, the, 100, whites, all, hanged, on, 3, november, the, frigate, hms, blanche, captured, a, supply, schooner, near, cap, fran, ais, the, last, hope, in, supplying, the, french, forces, on, 16, november, 1803, dessalines, began, attacking, the, french, blockhouses, outside, of, le, cap, the, last, battle, on, land, of, the, haitian, revolution, the, battle, of, verti, res, occurred, on, 18, november, 1803, near, cap, ha, tien, fought, between, dessalines, army, and, the, remaining, french, colonial, army, under, the, vicomte, de, rochambeau, the, slave, rebels, and, freed, revolutionary, soldiers, won, the, battle, by, this, point, perry, observed, that, both, sides, were, a, little, mad, as, the, pressures, of, the, war, and, yellow, fever, had, taken, their, toll, and, both, the, french, and, the, haitians, fought, with, a, reckless, courage, seeing, death, in, battle, as, preferable, to, a, slow, death, by, yellow, fever, or, being, tortured, to, death, by, the, enemy, rochambeau, seeing, defeat, inevitable, procrastinated, until, the, last, possible, moment, but, eventually, was, forced, to, surrender, to, the, british, commander, by, the, end, of, the, month, the, garrison, was, starving, having, reached, the, conclusion, at, a, council, of, war, that, surrender, was, the, only, way, to, escape, from, this, place, of, death, commodore, loring, however, refused, the, french, permission, to, sail, and, agreed, terms, with, dessalines, that, permitted, them, to, safely, evacuate, provided, they, had, left, the, port, by, 1, december, on, the, night, of, 30, november, 1803, 8, 000, french, soldiers, and, hundreds, of, white, civilians, boarded, the, british, ships, to, take, them, away, one, of, rochambeau, s, ships, was, almost, wrecked, while, leaving, the, harbour, but, was, saved, by, a, british, lieutenant, acting, alone, who, not, only, rescued, the, 900, people, on, board, but, also, refloated, the, ship, at, m, le, saint, nicolas, general, louis, de, noailles, refused, to, surrender, and, instead, sailed, to, havana, cuba, in, a, fleet, of, small, vessels, on, 3, december, but, was, intercepted, and, mortally, wounded, by, a, royal, navy, frigate, soon, after, the, few, remaining, french, held, towns, in, saint, domingue, surrendered, to, the, royal, navy, to, prevent, massacres, by, the, haitian, army, meanwhile, dessalines, led, the, rebellion, until, its, completion, when, the, french, forces, were, finally, defeated, by, the, end, of, 1803, on, 1, january, 1804, from, the, city, of, gona, ves, dessalines, officially, declared, the, former, colony, s, independence, renaming, it, haiti, after, the, indigenous, arawak, name, although, he, lasted, from, 1804, to, 1806, several, changes, began, taking, place, in, haiti, the, independence, of, haiti, was, a, major, blow, to, france, and, its, colonial, empire, but, the, french, state, would, take, several, decades, to, recognize, the, loss, of, the, colony, as, the, french, retreated, haiti, which, had, once, been, called, the, pearl, of, the, antilles, the, richest, french, colony, in, the, world, was, impoverished, as, its, economy, was, in, ruins, after, the, revolution, haiti, struggled, to, recover, economically, from, the, war, the, haitians, had, paid, a, high, price, for, their, freedom, losing, about, 200, 000, dead, between, 1791, and, 1803, and, unlike, the, majority, of, the, european, dead, who, were, killed, by, yellow, fever, the, majority, of, the, haitian, dead, were, the, victims, of, violence, in, the, early, 21st, century, historian, robert, l, scheina, estimated, that, the, slave, rebellion, resulted, in, the, death, of, 350, 000, haitians, and, 50, 000, european, troops, according, to, the, encyclopedia, of, african, american, politics, between, 1791, and, independence, in, 1804, nearly, 200, 000, blacks, died, as, did, thousands, of, mulattoes, and, as, many, as, 100, 000, french, and, british, soldiers, yellow, fever, caused, the, most, deaths, geggus, points, out, that, at, least, 3, of, every, 5, british, troops, sent, there, in, 1791, 1797, died, of, disease, there, has, been, considerable, debate, over, whether, the, number, of, deaths, caused, by, disease, was, exaggerated, an, estimated, 37, 000, french, soldiers, were, killed, in, action, during, the, haitian, revolution, exceeding, the, total, french, soldiers, killed, in, action, across, various, 19th, century, colonial, campaigns, in, algeria, mexico, indochina, tunisia, and, west, africa, which, resulted, in, approximately, 10, 000, french, soldiers, killed, in, action, combined, between, 1793, and, 1798, the, expedition, to, saint, domingue, had, cost, the, british, treasury, four, million, pounds, in, 1798, money, and, 100, 000, men, either, dead, wounded, or, permanently, disabled, from, the, effects, of, yellow, fever, on, 1, january, 1804, dessalines, the, new, leader, under, the, dictatorial, 1805, constitution, declared, haiti, a, free, republic, in, the, name, of, the, haitian, people, which, was, followed, by, the, massacre, of, the, remaining, whites, his, secretary, boisrond, tonnerre, stated, for, our, declaration, of, independence, we, should, have, the, skin, of, a, white, man, for, parchment, his, skull, for, an, inkwell, his, blood, for, ink, and, a, bayonet, for, a, pen, haiti, was, the, first, independent, nation, in, latin, america, the, first, post, colonial, independent, black, led, nation, in, the, world, and, the, only, nation, whose, independence, was, gained, as, part, of, a, successful, slave, rebellion, the, country, was, damaged, from, years, of, war, its, agriculture, devastated, its, formal, commerce, nonexistent, the, country, therefore, had, to, be, rebuilt, to, realise, this, goal, dessalines, adopted, the, economic, organisation, of, serfdom, he, proclaimed, that, every, citizen, would, belong, to, one, of, two, categories, laborer, or, soldier, furthermore, he, proclaimed, the, mastery, of, the, state, over, the, individual, and, consequently, ordered, that, all, laborers, would, be, bound, to, a, plantation, those, that, possessed, skills, outside, of, plantation, work, like, craftsmanship, and, artisans, were, exempt, from, this, ordinance, to, avoid, the, appearance, of, slavery, however, dessalines, abolished, the, ultimate, symbol, of, slavery, the, whip, likewise, the, working, day, was, shortened, by, a, third, his, chief, motivator, nonetheless, was, production, and, to, this, aim, he, granted, much, freedom, to, the, plantations, overseers, barred, from, using, the, whip, many, instead, turned, to, lianes, which, were, thick, vines, abundant, throughout, the, island, to, persuade, the, laborers, to, keep, working, many, of, the, workers, likened, the, new, labor, system, to, slavery, much, like, toussaint, l, ouverture, s, system, which, caused, resentment, between, dessalines, and, his, people, workers, were, given, a, fourth, of, all, wealth, produced, from, their, labor, nevertheless, he, succeeded, in, rebuilding, much, of, the, country, and, in, raising, production, levels, thus, slowly, rebuilding, the, economy, dessalines, paid, large, sums, of, money, to, liberate, slaves, on, slave, ships, near, the, haitian, coast, he, paid, for, the, expenses, of, the, returns, of, the, thousands, of, haitian, refugees, that, left, during, the, revolution, fearing, a, return, of, french, forces, dessalines, first, expanded, and, maintained, a, significant, military, force, during, his, reign, nearly, 10, of, able, bodied, men, were, in, active, service, resulting, in, a, military, force, of, up, to, 37, 000, men, furthermore, dessalines, ordered, the, construction, of, massive, fortifications, throughout, the, island, like, the, citadelle, laferri, re, the, largest, fortress, in, the, western, hemisphere, cities, and, commercial, centers, were, moved, to, the, interior, of, the, country, while, less, important, ones, were, kept, to, the, coast, so, they, could, be, burnt, down, completely, to, discourage, the, french, many, commentators, believe, that, this, over, militarization, contributed, to, many, of, haiti, s, future, problems, in, fact, because, young, fit, men, were, the, most, likely, to, be, drafted, into, the, army, the, plantations, were, thus, deprived, of, the, workforce, needed, to, function, properly, there, was, growing, frustration, between, the, workers, the, elites, and, dessalines, a, conspiracy, led, by, the, mulatto, elites, ultimately, led, to, dessalines, assassination, and, two, separate, sovereign, states, of, haiti, the, 1804, massacre, was, carried, out, against, the, remaining, white, population, of, french, colonists, and, loyalists, both, enemies, and, traitors, of, the, revolution, by, the, black, population, of, haiti, on, the, order, of, jean, jacques, dessalines, who, declared, the, french, as, barbarians, demanding, their, expulsion, and, vengeance, for, their, crimes, the, massacre, which, took, place, in, the, entire, territory, of, haiti, was, carried, out, from, early, february, 1804, until, 22, april, 1804, during, february, and, march, dessalines, traveled, among, the, cities, of, haiti, to, assure, himself, that, his, orders, were, carried, out, despite, his, orders, the, massacres, were, often, not, carried, out, until, he, personally, visited, the, cities, the, course, of, the, massacre, showed, an, almost, identical, pattern, in, every, city, he, visited, before, his, arrival, there, were, only, a, few, killings, despite, his, orders, when, dessalines, arrived, he, first, spoke, about, the, atrocities, committed, by, former, french, authorities, such, as, rochambeau, and, leclerc, after, which, he, demanded, that, his, orders, about, mass, killings, of, the, area, s, french, population, be, carried, out, reportedly, he, also, ordered, the, unwilling, to, take, part, in, the, killings, especially, men, of, mixed, race, so, that, blame, would, not, rest, solely, on, the, black, population, mass, killings, then, took, place, on, the, streets, and, on, places, outside, the, cities, in, parallel, to, the, killings, plundering, and, rape, also, occurred, women, and, children, were, generally, killed, last, white, women, were, often, raped, or, pushed, into, forced, marriages, under, threat, of, death, by, the, end, of, april, 1804, some, 3, 000, to, 5, 000, people, had, been, killed, practically, eradicating, the, country, s, white, population, dessalines, had, specifically, stated, that, france, is, the, real, enemy, of, the, new, nation, this, allowed, certain, categories, of, whites, to, be, excluded, from, massacre, who, had, to, pledge, their, rejection, to, france, the, polish, soldiers, who, deserted, from, the, french, army, the, group, of, german, colonists, of, nord, ouest, who, were, inhabitants, before, the, revolution, french, widows, who, were, allowed, to, keep, their, property, select, male, frenchmen, and, a, group, of, medical, doctors, and, professionals, reportedly, also, people, with, connections, to, haitian, notables, were, spared, as, well, as, the, women, who, agreed, to, marry, non, white, men, in, the, 1805, constitution, that, declared, all, its, citizens, as, black, it, specifically, mentions, the, naturalizations, of, german, and, polish, peoples, enacted, by, the, government, as, being, exempt, from, article, xii, that, prohibited, whites, non, haitians, foreigners, from, owning, land, an, independent, government, was, created, in, haiti, but, the, country, s, society, remained, deeply, affected, by, patterns, established, under, french, colonial, rule, as, in, other, french, colonial, societies, a, class, of, free, people, of, color, had, developed, after, centuries, of, french, rule, here, many, planters, or, young, unmarried, men, had, relations, with, african, or, afro, caribbean, women, sometimes, providing, for, their, freedom, and, that, of, their, children, as, well, as, providing, for, education, of, the, mixed, race, children, especially, the, boys, some, were, sent, to, france, for, education, and, training, and, some, joined, the, french, military, the, mulattoes, who, returned, to, saint, domingue, became, the, elite, of, the, people, of, color, as, an, educated, class, used, to, the, french, political, system, they, became, the, elite, of, haitian, society, after, the, war, s, end, many, of, them, had, used, their, social, capital, to, acquire, wealth, and, some, already, owned, land, some, had, identified, more, with, the, french, colonists, than, the, slaves, many, of, the, free, people, of, color, by, contrast, were, raised, in, french, culture, had, certain, rights, within, colonial, society, and, generally, spoke, french, and, practiced, catholicism, with, syncretic, absorption, of, african, religions, following, dessaline, s, assassination, another, of, toussaint, s, black, generals, henri, christophe, succeeded, his, in, control, of, the, north, while, alexandre, p, tion, presided, over, mulatto, rule, in, the, south, there, were, large, differences, in, governance, between, petion, s, republic, and, what, would, eventually, become, christophe, s, kingdom, while, the, southern, republic, did, not, have, as, much, focus, on, economic, development, and, put, more, attention, on, liberal, land, distribution, and, education, the, northern, kingdom, went, on, to, become, relatively, wealthy, though, wealth, distribution, was, disputed, as, a, result, of, temporary, trade, agreements, between, christophe, the, united, states, and, british, colonies, christophe, was, able, to, rebuild, the, northern, region, there, were, large, investments, in, education, and, public, works, military, infrastructure, and, many, chateaux, the, most, notable, being, the, sans, souci, palace, in, milot, however, much, like, his, predecessors, this, was, achieved, through, forced, labor, which, ultimately, led, to, his, downfall, contrarily, petion, was, beloved, by, his, people, but, despised, by, his, northern, counterpart, a, major, effort, by, christophe, to, take, port, au, prince, in, mid, 1812, failed, the, mulattoes, were, harassed, by, a, pocket, of, black, rebellion, in, their, rear, from, february, 1807, to, may, 1819, a, black, leader, named, goman, kept, alive, the, angry, spirit, of, dessalines, in, the, southern, mountains, of, the, grand, anse, resisting, several, mulatto, punitive, expeditions, finally, in, 1819, the, new, mulatto, leader, jean, pierre, boyer, sent, six, regiments, into, the, grand, anse, to, ferret, out, goman, the, black, rebel, was, trapped, and, shot, off, a, 1, 000, foot, high, cliff, in, 1820, the, island, nation, was, finally, reunified, when, christophe, ill, and, surrounded, by, new, rebellions, killed, himself, boyer, with, 20, 000, troops, marched, into, cap, ha, tien, the, northern, capital, shortly, afterward, to, establish, his, power, over, all, of, haiti, not, too, long, after, boyer, was, able, to, secure, cooperation, with, the, general, of, the, neighboring, spanish, haiti, and, in, february, 1822, began, a, 22, year, long, unification, with, the, eastern, state, the, nascent, state, s, future, was, hobbled, in, 1825, when, france, under, charles, x, forced, it, with, french, warships, anchored, off, the, coast, during, the, negotiations, to, pay, 150, million, gold, francs, in, reparations, to, french, ex, slaveholders, as, a, condition, of, french, political, recognition, and, to, end, the, newly, formed, state, s, political, and, economic, isolation, by, an, order, of, 17, april, 1825, the, king, of, france, renounced, his, rights, of, sovereignty, over, santo, domingo, and, recognized, the, independence, of, haiti, president, jean, pierre, boyer, believed, that, the, constant, threat, of, a, french, invasion, was, stymieing, the, haitian, economy, and, thus, felt, the, need, to, settle, the, matter, once, and, for, all, though, the, amount, of, the, reparations, was, reduced, to, 90, million, francs, in, 1838, haiti, was, unable, to, finish, paying, off, its, debt, until, 1947, the, indemnity, bankrupted, the, haitian, treasury, and, left, the, country, s, government, deeply, impoverished, causing, long, term, instability, haiti, was, therefore, forced, to, take, out, a, loan, from, french, banks, who, provided, the, funds, for, the, large, first, installment, severely, affecting, haiti, s, ability, to, prosper, while, haiti, suffered, major, economic, setbacks, during, the, early, years, of, the, post, revolutionary, era, the, ideals, of, freedom, and, anti, colonialism, never, ceased, to, be, part, of, the, haitian, consciousness, citizenship, was, offered, to, any, slave, or, oppressed, person, that, made, it, to, haiti, s, shores, as, mandated, by, dessaline, s, constitution, all, four, of, haiti, s, earlier, rulers, dessalines, christophe, petion, and, boyer, all, had, programs, that, involved, swaying, african, americans, to, resettle, there, and, assure, their, freedom, slave, boats, that, were, captured, and, brought, to, haiti, s, shores, resulted, in, the, liberation, and, integration, of, all, captives, on, board, into, haitian, society, on, one, occasion, president, alexandre, petion, protected, jamaican, slaves, from, re, enslavement, after, they, escaped, their, plantation, and, landed, in, the, southern, city, of, j, r, mie, on, multiple, occasions, haiti, s, leaders, offered, asylum, to, liberal, revolutionaries, globally, one, of, the, more, notable, examples, of, this, included, haiti, s, involvement, with, gran, colombia, where, dessalines, and, petion, both, offered, aid, ammunitions, and, asylum, to, francisco, de, miranda, and, sim, n, bol, var, who, even, went, as, far, as, to, credit, haiti, for, the, liberation, of, his, country, dessalines, offered, citizenship, and, assistance, to, slaves, in, martinique, and, guadeloupe, so, that, they, could, start, their, own, uprisings, mexican, nationalists, francisco, javier, mina, and, jos, joaqu, n, de, herrera, took, asylum, in, les, cayes, and, were, welcomed, by, petion, during, mexico, s, war, of, independence, the, greeks, later, received, support, from, president, boyer, during, their, fight, against, the, ottomans, the, end, of, the, haitian, revolution, in, 1804, marked, the, end, of, french, colonialism, on, the, island, however, the, social, conflict, cultivated, under, slavery, continued, to, affect, the, population, for, years, to, come, mulatto, domination, of, politics, and, economics, and, urban, life, after, the, revolution, created, a, different, kind, of, two, caste, society, as, most, haitians, were, rural, subsistence, farmers, the, affranchi, lite, who, continued, to, rule, haiti, while, the, formidable, haitian, army, kept, them, in, power, france, continued, the, slavery, system, in, french, guiana, martinique, and, guadeloupe, historians, continue, to, debate, the, importance, of, the, haitian, revolution, david, geggus, asks, how, much, of, a, difference, did, it, make, a, limited, amount, he, concludes, for, slavery, flourished, in, the, western, hemisphere, for, many, more, decades, in, the, opposing, camp, african, american, historian, w, e, b, du, bois, said, that, the, haitian, revolution, was, an, economic, pressure, without, which, the, british, parliament, would, not, have, accepted, abolitionism, as, readily, other, historians, say, the, haitian, revolution, influenced, slave, rebellions, in, the, u, s, as, well, as, in, british, colonies, the, biggest, slave, revolt, in, u, s, history, was, the, 1811, german, coast, uprising, in, louisiana, this, slave, rebellion, was, put, down, and, the, punishment, the, slaves, received, was, so, severe, that, no, contemporary, news, reports, about, it, exist, the, neighboring, revolution, brought, the, slavery, question, to, the, forefront, of, u, s, politics, and, though, inspiring, to, the, enslaved, themselves, the, resulting, intensification, of, racial, divides, and, sectional, politics, ended, the, idealism, of, the, revolutionary, period, the, american, president, thomas, jefferson, who, was, a, slaveholder, himself, refused, to, establish, diplomatic, relations, with, haiti, the, united, states, did, not, recognize, haiti, until, 1862, and, imposed, an, economic, embargo, on, trade, with, haiti, that, also, lasted, until, 1862, in, an, attempt, to, ensure, the, economic, failure, of, the, new, republic, as, jefferson, wanted, haiti, to, fail, regarding, a, successful, slave, revolt, in, the, west, indies, as, a, dangerous, example, for, american, slaves, beginning, during, the, slave, insurrections, of, 1791, white, refugees, from, saint, domingue, fled, to, the, united, states, particularly, to, philadelphia, baltimore, new, york, and, charleston, the, immigration, intensified, after, the, journ, e, crisis, of, 20, june, 1793, and, soon, american, families, began, to, raise, money, and, open, up, their, homes, to, help, exiles, in, what, became, the, united, states, first, refugee, crisis, while, some, white, refugees, blamed, the, french, revolutionary, government, for, sparking, the, violence, in, haiti, many, supported, the, republican, regime, and, openly, expressed, their, support, of, the, jacobins, there, is, also, some, historical, evidence, suggesting, that, displaying, solidarity, with, the, french, revolution, was, the, easiest, way, for, the, refugees, to, earn, the, support, and, sympathy, of, the, americans, who, had, just, recently, lived, through, their, own, revolution, american, slaveholders, in, particular, commiserated, with, the, french, planters, who, had, been, forcibly, removed, from, their, plantations, in, saint, domingue, while, the, exiles, found, themselves, in, a, peaceful, situation, in, the, united, states, safe, from, the, violence, raging, in, both, france, and, haiti, their, presence, complicated, the, already, precarious, diplomatic, relations, among, britain, france, and, the, u, s, many, of, the, whites, and, free, people, of, color, who, left, saint, domingue, for, the, united, states, settled, in, southern, louisiana, adding, many, new, members, to, its, french, speaking, mixed, race, and, black, populations, the, exiles, causing, the, most, alarm, were, the, african, slaves, who, came, with, their, refugee, owners, some, southern, planters, grew, concerned, that, the, presence, of, these, slaves, who, had, witnessed, the, revolution, in, haiti, would, ignite, similar, revolts, in, the, united, states, other, planters, however, were, confident, they, had, the, situation, under, control, in, 1807, haiti, was, divided, into, two, parts, the, republic, of, haiti, in, the, south, and, the, kingdom, of, haiti, in, the, north, land, could, not, be, privately, owned, it, reverted, to, the, state, through, biens, nationaux, national, bonds, and, no, french, whites, could, own, land, the, remaining, french, settlers, were, forced, to, leave, the, island, those, who, refused, were, slaughtered, the, haitian, state, owned, up, to, 90, of, the, land, and, the, other, 10, was, leased, in, 5, year, intervals, since, the, resistance, and, the, murderous, disease, environment, made, it, impossible, for, napoleon, to, regain, control, over, haiti, he, gave, up, hope, of, rebuilding, a, french, new, world, empire, he, decided, to, sell, louisiana, to, the, u, s, the, haitian, revolution, brought, about, two, unintended, consequences, the, creation, of, a, continental, america, and, the, virtual, end, of, napoleonic, rule, in, the, americas, there, never, again, was, such, a, large, scale, slave, rebellion, napoleon, reversed, the, french, abolition, of, slavery, in, law, constitution, and, practice, which, had, occurred, between, 1793, and, 1801, and, reinstated, slavery, in, the, french, colonies, in, 1801, 1803, which, lasted, until, 1848, the, haitian, revolution, was, a, revolution, ignited, from, below, by, the, underrepresented, majority, of, the, population, a, huge, majority, of, the, supporters, of, the, haitian, revolution, were, slaves, and, freed, africans, who, were, severely, discriminated, against, by, colonial, society, and, the, law, despite, the, idealist, rational, and, utopian, thinking, surrounding, both, uprisings, extreme, brutality, was, a, fundamental, aspect, of, both, uprisings, besides, initial, cruelty, that, created, the, precarious, conditions, that, bred, the, revolution, there, was, violence, from, both, sides, throughout, the, revolution, the, period, of, violence, during, the, french, revolution, is, known, as, the, reign, of, terror, waves, of, suspicion, meant, that, the, government, rounded, up, and, killed, thousands, of, suspects, ranging, from, known, aristocrats, to, people, thought, to, oppose, the, leaders, they, were, killed, by, guillotine, breaking, at, the, wheel, mobs, and, other, death, machines, death, toll, estimates, range, from, 18, 000, to, 40, 000, total, casualties, for, the, french, revolution, are, estimated, at, 2, million, in, the, caribbean, total, casualties, totaled, approximately, 162, 000, violence, in, haiti, was, largely, characterized, by, military, confrontations, riots, killing, of, slave, owners, and, their, families, and, guerrilla, warfare, the, revolution, in, haiti, did, not, wait, on, the, revolution, in, france, the, call, for, modification, of, society, was, influenced, by, the, revolution, in, france, but, once, the, hope, for, change, found, a, place, in, the, hearts, of, the, haitian, people, there, was, no, stopping, the, radical, reformation, that, was, occurring, the, enlightenment, ideals, and, the, initiation, of, the, french, revolution, were, enough, to, inspire, the, haitian, revolution, which, evolved, into, the, most, successful, and, comprehensive, slave, rebellion, in, history, just, as, the, french, were, successful, in, transforming, their, society, so, were, the, haitians, on, 4, april, 1792, the, french, legislative, assembly, granted, freedom, to, slaves, in, saint, domingue, the, revolution, culminated, in, 1804, haiti, was, an, independent, state, solely, of, freed, peoples, the, activities, of, the, revolutions, sparked, change, across, the, world, france, s, transformation, was, most, influential, in, europe, and, haiti, s, influence, spanned, every, location, that, continued, to, practice, slavery, john, e, baur, honors, haiti, as, home, of, the, most, influential, revolution, in, history, while, acknowledging, the, cross, influences, most, contemporary, historians, distinguish, the, haitian, revolution, from, the, french, revolution, some, also, separate, it, from, the, earlier, armed, conflicts, by, free, men, of, color, who, were, seeking, expansion, of, political, rights, for, themselves, but, not, the, abolition, of, slavery, these, scholars, show, that, if, the, agency, of, the, enslaved, blacks, becomes, the, focus, of, studies, the, revolution, s, opening, and, closing, dates, are, certain, from, this, premise, the, narrative, began, with, the, enslaved, blacks, bid, for, freedom, through, armed, struggle, and, concluded, with, their, victory, over, slavery, powers, and, the, creation, of, an, independent, state, in, april, 1791, a, massive, black, insurgency, in, the, north, of, the, island, rose, violently, against, the, plantation, system, setting, a, precedent, of, resistance, to, racial, slavery, in, cooperation, with, their, former, mulatto, rivals, blacks, ended, the, revolution, in, november, 1803, when, they, decidedly, defeated, the, french, army, at, the, battle, of, verti, res, the, french, had, already, lost, a, high, proportion, of, their, troops, to, yellow, fever, and, other, diseases, after, acknowledging, defeat, in, saint, domingue, napoleon, withdrew, from, north, america, agreeing, to, the, louisiana, purchase, by, the, united, states, although, the, series, of, events, during, these, years, is, known, under, the, name, of, haitian, revolution, alternative, views, suggest, that, the, entire, affair, was, an, assorted, number, of, coincidental, conflicts, that, ended, with, a, fragile, truce, between, free, men, of, color, and, blacks, historians, debate, whether, the, victorious, haitians, were, intrinsically, revolutionary, force, one, thing, is, certain, haiti, became, an, independent, country, on, 1, january, 1804, when, the, council, of, generals, chose, jean, jacques, dessalines, to, assume, the, office, of, governor, general, one, of, the, state, s, first, significant, documents, was, dessaliness, liberty, or, death, speech, which, circulated, broadly, in, the, foreign, press, in, it, the, new, head, of, state, made, the, case, for, the, new, nation, s, objective, the, permanent, abolition, of, slavery, in, haiti, the, role, of, women, in, the, haitian, revolution, was, for, a, long, time, given, little, attention, by, historians, but, has, in, recent, years, garnered, significant, attention, the, revolution, of, african, slaves, brought, many, fears, to, colonies, surrounding, haiti, and, the, caribbean, prominent, wealthy, american, slave, owners, reading, about, the, revolution, also, read, speculation, about, what, might, come, in, their, own, states, anti, abolitionist, critics, of, the, revolution, dubbed, it, the, horrors, of, santo, domingo, however, newspapers, like, the, columbian, centinel, took, extra, steps, to, support, the, revolution, comparing, it, to, the, american, revolution, the, french, media, also, played, an, important, role, in, the, haitian, revolution, with, contributions, that, made, many, french, upstarts, quite, interested, in, the, young, passionate, toussaint, s, writings, of, freedom, there, were, many, written, discussions, about, the, events, in, haiti, during, the, revolution, in, both, france, and, england, however, they, were, generally, written, by, anonymous, authors, these, texts, also, generally, fell, into, two, camps, one, being, proslavery, authors, who, warned, of, a, repetition, of, the, violence, of, st, domingue, wherever, abolition, occurred, and, the, other, being, abolitionist, authors, who, countered, that, white, owners, had, sown, the, seeds, of, revolution, however, all, was, not, simple, in, the, press, a, top, critic, who, significantly, drove, toussaint, into, fear, of, backlash, from, france, was, sonthonax, who, was, responsible, for, many, outlooks, of, haiti, in, the, french, newspapers, yet, sonthonax, was, one, of, the, few, contenders, who, truly, pushed, for, the, independence, of, the, african, slaves, and, became, a, major, factor, in, toussaint, s, decision, of, declaring, independence, from, france
