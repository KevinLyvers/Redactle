death, of, henry, ii, of, france, in, july, 1559, initiated, a, prolonged, struggle, for, power, between, his, widow, catherine, de, medici, and, powerful, nobles, these, included, a, fervently,

edict, of, nantes, along, with, french, wars, of, religion, and, huguenot, wars, the, wars, have, also, been, variously, described, as, the, eight, wars, of, religion, or, simply, the, wars, of, religion, only, within, france, the, exact, number, of, wars, and, their, respective, dates, are, subject, to, continued, debate, by, historians, some, assert, that, the, edict, of, nantes, 13, april, 1598, and, the, peace, of, vervins, 2, may, 1598, concluded, the, wars, while, the, ensuing, 1620s, huguenot, rebellions, lead, others, to, believe, the, peace, of, al, s, in, 1629, is, the, actual, conclusion, however, the, agreed, upon, beginning, of, the, wars, is, the, massacre, of, wassy, in, 1562, and, the, edict, of, nantes, at, least, ended, this, series, of, conflicts, during, this, time, complex, diplomatic, negotiations, and, agreements, of, peace, were, followed, by, renewed, conflict, and, power, struggles, american, military, historians, kiser, drass, brustein, 1994,

different, periodisation, from, 1562, to, 1629, writing, of, civil, wars, rather, than, wars, of, religion, dating, the, sixth, war, to, march, september, 1577, and, dating, the, eight, war, from,

renaissance, humanism, began, during, the, 14th, century, in, italy, and, arrived, in, france, in, the, early, 16th, coinciding, with, the, rise, of, protestantism, in, france, the, movement, emphasised, the, importance, of, ad, fontes, or, study, of, original, sources, and, initially, focused, on, the, reconstruction, of, secular, greek, and, latin, texts, it, later, expanded, into, the, reading, study, and, translation, of, works, by, the, church, fathers, and, the, new, testament, with, a, view, to, religious, renewal, and, reform, humanist, scholars, argued, interpretation, of, the, bible, required, an, ability, to, read, the, new, testament, and, old, testaments, in, the, original, greek, and, hebrew, rather, than, relying, on, the, 4th, century, latin, translation, known, as, the, vulgate, bible, in, 1495, the, venetian, aldus, manutius, began, using, the, newly, invented, printing, press, to, produce, small, inexpensive, pocket, editions, of, greek, latin, and, vernacular, literature, making, knowledge, in, all, disciplines, available, for, the, first, time, to, a, wide, audience, cheap, pamphlets, and, broadsides, allowed, theological, and, religious, ideas, to, be, disseminated, at, an, unprecedented, pace, in, 1519, john, froben, published, a, collection, of, works, by, martin, luther, and, noted, in, his, correspondence, that, 600, copies, were, being, shipped, to, france, and, spain, and, sold, in, paris, in, 1521, a, group, of, reformers, including, jacques, lef, vre, and, guillaume, bri, onnet, recently, appointed, bishop, of, meaux, formed, the, circle, of, meaux, aiming, to, improve, the, quality, of, preaching, and, religious, life, in, general, they, were, joined, by, fran, ois, vatable, an, expert, in, hebrew, along, with, guillaume, bud, a, classicist, and, royal, librarian, lef, vre, s, fivefold, psalter, and, his, commentary, on, the, epistle, to, the, romans, emphasised, the, literal, interpretation, of, the, bible, and, the, centrality, of, jesus, christ, many, of, the, tenets, behind, lutheranism, first, appeared, in, luther, s, lectures, which, in, turn, contained, many, of, the, ideas, expressed, in, the, works, of, lef, vre, other, members, of, the, circle, included, marguerite, de, navarre, sister, of, francis, i, and, mother, of, jeanne, d, albret, as, well, as, guillaume, farel, who, was, exiled, to, geneva, in, 1530, due, to, his, reformist, views, and, persuaded, john, calvin, to, join, him, there, both, men, were, banished, from, geneva, in, 1538, for, opposing, what, they, viewed, as, government, interference, with, religious, affairs, although, the, two, fell, out, over, the, nature, of, the, eucharist, calvin, s, return, to, geneva, in, 1541, allowed, him, to, forge, the, doctrine, of, calvinism, a, key, driver, behind, the, reform, movement, was, corruption, among, the, clergy, which, luther, and, others, attacked, and, sought, to, change, such, criticisms, were, not, new, but, the, printing, press, allowed, them, to, be, widely, shared, such, as, the, heptameron, by, marguerite, a, collection, of, stories, about, clerical, immorality, another, complaint, was, the, reduction, of, salvation, to, a, business, scheme, based, on, the, sale, of, indulgences, which, added, to, general, unrest, and, increased, the, popularity, of, works, such, as, farel, s, translation, of, the, lord, s, prayer, the, true, and, perfect, prayer, this, focused, on, sola, fide, or, the, idea, salvation, was, a, free, gift, from, god, emphasised, the, importance, of, understanding, in, prayer, and, criticised, the, clergy, for, hampering, the, growth, of, true, faith, the, italian, revival, of, classical, learning, appealed, to, francis, i, 1494, 1547, who, set, up, royal, professorships, in, paris, to, better, understand, ancient, literature, however, this, did, not, extend, to, religion, especially, after, the, 1516, concordat, of, bologna, when, pope, leo, x, increased, royal, control, of, the, gallican, church, allowing, francis, to, nominate, french, clergy, and, levy, taxes, on, church, property, unlike, germany, the, french, nobility, also, generally, supported, the, status, quo, and, existing, policies, despite, his, personal, opposition, francis, tolerated, martin, luther, s, ideas, when, they, entered, france, in, the, late, 1520s, largely, because, the, definition, of, catholic, orthodoxy, was, unclear, making, it, hard, to, determine, precisely, what, was, or, was, not, heresy, he, tried, to, steer, a, middle, course, in, the, developing, religious, schism, but, in, january, 1535, catholic, authorities, made, a, definitive, ruling, by, classifying, lutherans, as, heretical, zwinglians, calvin, originally, from, noyon, in, picardy, went, into, exile, in, 1535, to, escape, persecution, and, settled, in, basel, where, he, published, the, institutes, of, the, christian, religion, in, 1538, this, work, contained, the, key, principles, of, calvinism, which, became, immensely, popular, in, france, and, other, european, countries, while, lutheranism, was, widespread, within, the, french, commercial, class, the, rapid, growth, of, calvinism, was, driven, by, the, nobility, it, is, believed, to, have, started, when, cond, passed, through, geneva, while, returning, home, from, a, military, campaign, and, heard, a, calvinist, sermon, jeanne, d, albret, queen, of, navarre, converted, to, calvinism, in, 1560, possibly, due, to, the, influence, of, theodore, de, beze, along, with, cond, and, her, husband, antoine, of, navarre, she, and, their, son, henry, of, navarre, became, huguenot, leaders, the, crown, continued, efforts, to, remain, neutral, in, the, religious, debate, until, the, affair, of, the, placards, in, october, 1534, when, protestant, radicals, put, up, posters, in, paris, and, other, provincial, towns, that, rejected, the, catholic, doctrine, of, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, this, allowed, protestantism, to, be, clearly, defined, as, heresy, while, francis, was, furious, at, the, breach, of, security, which, had, allowed, one, of, the, posters, to, be, placed, on, the, door, of, his, bedchamber, having, been, severely, criticised, for, his, initial, tolerance, he, was, now, encouraged, to, punish, those, responsible, on, 21, february, 1535, a, number, of, those, implicated, in, the, affair, were, executed, in, front, of, notre, dame, de, paris, an, event, attended, by, francis, and, members, of, the, ottoman, embassy, to, france, the, fight, against, heresy, intensified, in, the, 1540s, forcing, protestants, to, worship, in, secret, in, october, 1545, francis, ordered, the, punishment, of, waldensians, based, in, the, south, eastern, village, of, m, rindol, a, long, standing, proto, protestantism, tradition, dating, back, to, the, 13th, century, the, waldensians, had, recently, affiliated, with, the, reformed, church, and, became, increasingly, militant, in, their, activities, in, what, became, known, as, the, massacre, of, m, rindol, proven, al, troops, killed, numerous, residents, and, destroyed, another, 22, to, 28, nearby, villages, while, hundreds, of, men, were, forced, to, become, galley, slaves, francis, i, died, on, 31, march, 1547, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, henry, ii, who, continued, the, religious, repression, pursued, by, his, father, in, the, last, years, of, his, reign, his, policies, were, even, more, severe, since, he, sincerely, believed, all, protestants, were, heretics, on, 27, june, 1551, the, edict, of, ch, teaubriant, sharply, curtailed, their, right, to, worship, prohibitions, were, placed, upon, the, distribution, of, heretical, literature, with, the, property, of, heretics, seizable, by, the, crown, from, his, base, in, geneva, calvin, provided, leadership, and, organisational, structures, for, the, reformed, church, of, france, calvinism, proved, attractive, to, people, from, across, the, social, hierarchy, and, occupational, divides, and, was, highly, regionalised, with, no, coherent, pattern, of, geographical, spread, despite, persecution, their, numbers, and, power, increased, markedly, driven, by, the, conversion, to, calvinism, of, large, sections, of, the, nobility, historians, estimate, that, by, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1562, there, were, around, two, million, french, calvinists, including, more, than, half, of, the, nobility, backed, by, 1, 200, 1, 250, churches, this, constituted, a, substantial, threat, to, the, monarchy, the, death, of, henry, ii, in, july, 1559, created, a, political, vacuum, and, an, internal, struggle, for, power, between, rival, factions, which, the, 15, year, old, francis, ii, lacked, the, ability, to, control, francis, duke, of, guise, whose, niece, mary, queen, of, scots, was, married, to, the, king, exploited, the, situation, to, establish, dominance, over, their, rivals, the, house, of, montmorency, within, days, of, the, king, s, accession, the, english, ambassador, reported, the, house, of, guise, ruleth, and, doth, all, about, the, french, king, on, 10, march, 1560, a, group, of, disaffected, nobles, led, by, jean, du, barry, attempted, to, break, the, power, of, the, guise, by, abducting, the, young, king, their, plans, were, discovered, before, being, carried, out, and, hundreds, of, suspected, plotters, executed, including, du, barry, the, guise, suspected, cond, of, involvement, in, the, plot, and, he, was, arrested, and, sentenced, to, death, before, being, freed, in, the, political, chaos, that, followed, the, sudden, death, of, francis, ii, adding, to, the, tensions, of, the, period, in, the, aftermath, of, the, plot, the, term, huguenot, for, france, s, protestants, came, into, widespread, usage, shortly, afterwards, the, first, instances, of, protestant, iconoclasm, or, the, destruction, of, images, and, statues, in, catholic, churches, occurred, in, rouen, and, la, rochelle, this, continued, throughout, 1561, in, more, than, 20, cities, and, towns, sparking, attacks, on, protestants, by, catholic, mobs, in, sens, cahors, carcassonne, tours, and, elsewhere, when, francis, ii, died, on, 5, december, 1560, his, mother, catherine, de, medici, became, regent, for, her, second, son, the, nine, year, old, charles, ix, with, the, state, financially, exhausted, by, the, italian, wars, catherine, had, to, preserve, the, independence, of, the, monarchy, from, a, range, of, competing, factions, led, by, powerful, nobles, each, of, whom, controlled, what, were, essentially, private, armies, to, offset, the, guise, or, guisard, she, agreed, a, deal, in, which, antoine, of, navarre, renounced, any, claim, to, the, regency, in, return, for, cond, s, release, and, the, position, of, lieutenant, general, of, france, catherine, had, several, options, for, dealing, with, heresy, including, continuing, henry, s, ii, s, failed, policy, of, eradication, an, approach, backed, by, catholic, ultras, such, as, fran, ois, de, tournon, or, converting, the, monarchy, to, calvinism, as, preferred, by, de, b, ze, a, middle, path, between, these, two, extremes, was, allowing, both, religions, to, be, openly, practised, in, france, at, least, temporarily, or, the, guisard, compromise, of, scaling, back, persecution, but, not, permitting, toleration, for, the, moment, she, held, to, the, guisard, line, before, his, death, francis, ii, had, called, the, first, estates, general, held, since, 1484, which, in, december, 1560, assembled, in, orl, ans, to, discuss, topics, which, included, taxation, and, religion, it, made, little, progress, on, the, latter, other, than, agreeing, to, pardon, those, convicted, of, religious, offences, in, the, prior, year, since, this, was, clearly, unacceptable, to, cond, and, his, followers, catherine, bypassed, the, estates, and, enacted, conciliatory, measures, such, as, the, edict, of, 19, april, 1561, and, the, edict, of, july, this, recognised, catholicism, as, the, state, religion, but, confirmed, previous, measures, reducing, penalties, for, heresy, the, estates, then, approved, the, colloquy, of, poissy, which, began, its, session, on, 8, september, 1561, with, the, protestants, led, by, de, b, ze, and, the, catholics, by, charles, cardinal, of, lorraine, brother, of, the, duke, of, guise, the, two, sides, initially, sought, to, accommodate, protestant, forms, of, worship, within, the, existing, church, but, this, proved, impossible, by, the, time, the, colloquy, ended, on, 8, october, it, was, clear, the, divide, between, catholic, and, protestant, theology, was, too, wide, to, be, bridged, with, their, options, narrowing, the, government, attempted, to, quell, escalating, disorder, in, the, provinces, by, passing, the, edict, of, saint, germain, which, allowed, protestants, to, worship, in, public, outside, towns, and, in, private, inside, them, on, 1, march, guise, family, retainers, attacked, a, calvinist, service, in, champagne, leading, to, what, became, known, as, the, massacre, of, vassy, this, seemed, to, confirm, huguenot, fears, that, the, guisards, had, no, intention, of, compromising, and, is, generally, seen, as, the, spark, which, led, to, open, hostilities, between, the, two, religions, guyenne, was, the, epicentre, of, the, turn, to, religious, violence, in, late, 16th, century, france, many, explanations, have, been, proffered, for, the, rise, of, violence, traditional, explanations, focus, on, the, influence, of, jeanne, d, albret, and, antoine, of, navarre, other, explanations, focus, on, the, rise, of, seigneurialism, in, the, 1550s, and, see, the, turn, to, violence, as, a, response, of, the, peasant, class, the, murder, of, the, baron, of, ch, teau, de, fumel, by, a, protestant, mob, in, 1561, is, often, cited, as, an, example, recent, analyses, on, the, other, hand, have, turned, the, focus, on, religious, explanations, denis, crouzet, fingers, the, fiery, eschatological, preaching, of, the, franciscan, thomas, illyricus, who, toured, the, region, in, the, 1510s, and, 1520s, stuart, carroll, however, argues, for, politicization, the, violence, was, directly, caused, by, politicized, factions, and, was, not, the, result, of, a, spontaneous, intercommunal, eruption, although, the, huguenots, had, begun, mobilising, for, war, before, the, vassy, massacre, many, claimed, that, the, massacre, confirmed, claims, that, they, could, not, rely, on, the, edict, of, saint, germain, in, response, a, group, of, nobles, led, by, cond, proclaimed, their, intention, of, liberating, the, king, from, evil, councillors, and, seized, orl, ans, on, 2, april, 1562, this, example, was, quickly, followed, by, protestant, groups, around, france, who, seized, and, garrisoned, angers, blois, and, tours, along, the, loire, and, assaulted, valence, in, the, rh, ne, river, after, capturing, lyon, on, 30, april, the, attackers, first, sacked, then, demolished, all, catholic, institutions, in, the, city, hoping, to, turn, toulouse, over, to, cond, local, huguenots, seized, the, h, tel, de, ville, but, met, resistance, from, angry, catholic, mobs, which, resulted, in, street, battles, and, over, 3, 000, deaths, mostly, huguenots, on, 12, april, 1562, there, were, massacres, of, huguenots, at, sens, as, well, as, at, tours, in, july, as, the, conflict, escalated, the, crown, revoked, the, edict, under, pressure, from, the, guise, faction, the, major, engagements, of, the, war, occurred, at,

mediate, a, truce, resulting, in, the, edict, of, amboise, on, 19, march, 1563, the, edict, of, amboise, was, generally, regarded, as, unsatisfactory, by, all, concerned, and, the, guise, faction, was, particularly, opposed, to, what, they, saw, as, dangerous, concessions, to, heretics, the, crown, tried, to, re, unite, the, two, factions, in, its, efforts, to, re, capture, le, havre, which, had, been, occupied, by, the, english, in, 1562, as, part, of, the, treaty, of, hampton, court, between, its, huguenot, leaders, and, elizabeth, i, of, england, that, july, the, french, expelled, the,

france, to, support, his, fellow, protestants, but, the, army, being, poorly, paid, he, accepted, the, crown, s, offer, of, money, and, free, passage, to, leave, the, country, the, huguenots, gathered, a, formidable, army, under, the, command, of, cond, aided, by, forces, from, south, east, france, led, by, paul, de, mouvans, and, a, contingent, of, fellow, protestant, militias, from, germany, including, 14, 000, mercenary, reiters, led, by, the, calvinist, duke, of, zweibr, cken, after, the, duke, was, killed, in, action, his, troops, remained, under, the, employ, of, the, huguenots, who, had, raised, a, loan, from, england, against, the, security, of, jeanne, d, albret, s, crown, jewels, much, of, the, huguenots, financing, came, from, queen, elizabeth, of, england, who, was, likely, influenced, in, the, matter, by, sir, francis, walsingham, the, catholics, were, commanded, by, the, duke, d, anjou, later, king, henry, iii, and, assisted, by, troops, from, spain, the, papal, states, and, the, grand, duchy, of, tuscany, the, protestant, army, laid, siege, to, several, cities, in, the, poitou, and, saintonge, regions, to, protect, la, rochelle, and, then, angoul, me, and, cognac, at, the, battle, of, jarnac, 16, march, 1569, the, prince, of, cond, was, killed, forcing, admiral, de, coligny, to, take, command, of, the, protestant, forces, nominally, on, behalf, of, cond, s, 16, year, old, son, henry, and, the, 15, year, old, henry, of, navarre, who, were, presented, by, jeanne, d, albret, as, the, legitimate, leaders, of, the, huguenot, cause, against, royal, authority, the, battle, of, la, roche, l, abeille, was, a, nominal, victory, for, the, huguenots, but, they, were, unable, to, seize, control, of, poitiers, and, were, soundly, defeated, at, the, battle, of, moncontour, 30, october, 1569, coligny, and, his, troops, retreated, to, the, south, west, and, regrouped, with, gabriel, comte, de, montgomery, and, in, spring, of, 1570, they, pillaged, toulouse, cut, a, path, through, the, south, of, france, and, went, up, the, rhone, valley, up, to, la, charit, sur, loire, the, staggering, royal, debt, and, charles, ix, s, desire, to, seek, a, peaceful, solution, led, to, the, peace, of, saint, germain, en, laye, 8, august, 1570, negotiated, by, jeanne, d, albret, which, once, more, allowed, some, concessions, to, the, huguenots, with, the, kingdom, once, more, at, peace, the, crown, began, seeking, a, policy, of, reconciliation, to, bring, the, fractured, polity, back, together, one, key, part, of, this, was, to, be, a, marriage, between, navarre, the, son, of, jeanne, d, albret, and, antoine, of, navarre, and, margaret, of, valois, the, king, s, sister, albret, was, hesitant, worried, it, might, lead, to, the, abjuration, of, her, son, and, it, took, until, march, 1572, for, the, contract, to, be, signed, coligny, who, had, a, price, on, his, head, during, the, third, civil, war, was, restored, to, favour, through, the, peace, and, received, lavishly, at, court, in, august, 1571, he, firmly, believed, that, france, should, invade, the, spanish, netherlands, to, unify, the, catholics, and, huguenots, behind, the, king, charles, however, was, unwilling, to, provide, more, than, covert, support, to, this, project, not, wanting, open, war, with, spain, the, council, was, unanimous, in, rejecting, coligny, s, policy, and, he, left, court, not, finding, it, welcoming, in, august, the, wedding, was, finally, held, and, all, the, most, powerful, huguenot, aristocracy, had, entered, paris, for, the, occasion, a, few, days, after, the, wedding, coligny, was, shot, on, his, way, home, from, council, the, outraged, huguenot, nobility, demanded, justice, which, the, king, promised, to, provide, catherine, guise, anjou, and, alba, were, all, variously, suspected, though, the, huguenot, nobility, directed, their, anger, primarily, at, guise, threatening, to, kill, him, in, front, of, the, king, the, court, increasingly, alarmed, at, the, possibility, of, protestant, forces, marching, on, the, capital, or, a, new, civil, war, decided, to, pre, emptively, strike, at, the, huguenot, leadership, on, the, morning, of, 24, august, several, kill, squads, were, formed, one, going, out, under, guise, which, killed, coligny, around, 4am, leaving, his, body, on, the, street, where, it, was, mutilated, by, parisians, and, thrown, into, the, seine, by, dawn, it, was, clear, the, assassinations, had, not, gone, according, to, plan, with, militant, factions, of, the, population, slaughtering, their, huguenot, neighbours, under, the, claim, that, the, king, willed, it, for, the, next, five, days, the, violence, continued, as, catholics, massacred, calvinist, men, women, and, children, and, looted, their, houses, king, charles, ix, informed, ambassadors, that, he, had, ordered, the, assassinations, to, prevent, a, huguenot, coup, and, proclaimed, a, day, of, jubilee, in, celebration, even, as, the, killings, continued, over, the, next, few, weeks, the, disorder, spread, to, more, than, a, dozen, cities, across, france, historians, estimate, that, 2, 000, huguenots, were, killed, in, paris, and, thousands, more, in, the, provinces, in, all, perhaps, 10, 000, people, were, killed, henry, of, navarre, and, his, cousin, the, young, prince, of, cond, managed, to, avoid, death, by, agreeing, to, convert, to, catholicism, both, repudiated, their, conversions, after, they, escaped, paris, the, massacre, provoked, horror, and, outrage, among, protestants, throughout, europe, but, both, philip, ii, of, spain, and, pope, gregory, xiii, following, the, official, version, that, a, huguenot, coup, had, been, thwarted, celebrated, the, outcome, in, france, huguenot, opposition, to, the, crown, was, seriously, weakened, by, the, deaths, of, many, of, the, leaders, many, huguenots, emigrated, to, protestant, countries, others, reconverted, to, catholicism, for, survival, and, the, remainder, concentrated, in, a, small, number, of, cities, where, they, formed, a, majority, the, massacres, provoked, further, military, action, which, included, catholic, sieges, of, the, cities, of, sommi, res, by, troops, led, by, henri, i, de, montmorency, sancerre, and, la, rochelle, by, troops, led, by, the, duke, of, anjou, the, end, of, hostilities, was, brought, on, by, the, election, 11, 15, may, 1573, of, the, duke, of, anjou, to, the, throne, of, poland, and, by, the, edict, of, boulogne, signed, in, july, 1573, which, severely, curtailed, many, of, the, rights, previously, granted, to, french, protestants, based, on, the, terms, of, the, treaty, all, huguenots, were, granted, amnesty, for, their, past, actions, and, the, freedom, of, belief, however, they, were, permitted, the, freedom, to, worship, only, within, the, three, towns, of, la, rochelle, montauban, and, n, mes, and, even, then, only, within, their, own, residences, protestant, aristocrats, with, the, right, of, high, justice, were, permitted, to, celebrate, marriages, and, baptisms, but, only, before, an, assembly, limited, to, ten, persons, outside, of, their, family, in, the, absence, of, the, duke, of, anjou, disputes, between, charles, and, his, youngest, brother, the, duke, of, alen, on, led, to, many, huguenots, congregating, around, alen, on, for, patronage, and, support, a, failed, coup, at, saint, germain, february, 1574, allegedly, aiming, to, release, cond, and, navarre, who, had, been, held, at, court, since, st, bartholemew, s, coincided, with, rather, successful, huguenot, uprisings, in, other, parts, of, france, such, as, lower, normandy, poitou, and, the, rh, ne, valley, which, reinitiated, hostilities, three, months, after, henry, of, anjou, s, coronation, as, king, of, poland, his, brother, charles, ix, died, may, 1574, and, his, mother, declared, herself, regent, until, his, return, henry, secretly, left, poland, and, returned, via, venice, to, france, where, he, faced, the, defection, of, montmorency, damville, ex, commander, in, the, midi, november, 1574, despite, having, failed, to, have, established, his, authority, over, the, midi, he, was, crowned, king, henry, iii, at, rheims, february, 1575, marrying, louise, vaud, mont, a, kinswoman, of, the, guise, the, following, day, by, april, the, crown, was, already, seeking, to, negotiate, and, the, escape, of, alen, on, from, court, in, september, prompted, the, possibility, of, an, overwhelming, coalition, of, forces, against, the, crown, as, john, casimir, of, the, palatinate, invaded, champagne, the, crown, hastily, negotiated, a, truce, of, seven, months, with, alen, on, and, promised, casimir, s, forces, 500, 000, livres, to, stay, east, of, the, rhine, but, neither, action, secured, a, peace, by, may, 1576, the, crown, was, forced, to, accept, the, terms, of, alen, on, and, the, huguenots, who, supported, him, in, the, edict, of, beaulieu, known, as, the, peace, of, monsieur, the, edict, of, beaulieu, granted, many, concessions, to, the, calvinists, but, these, were, short, lived, in, the, face, of, the, catholic, league, which, the, ultra, catholic, henry, i, duke, of, guise, had, formed, in, opposition, to, it, the, house, of, guise, had, long, been, identified, with, the, defense, of, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, duke, of, guise, and, his, relations, the, duke, of, mayenne, duke, of, aumale, duke, of, elbeuf, duke, of, merc, ur, and, the, duke, of, lorraine, controlled, extensive, territories, that, were, loyal, to, the, league, the, league, also, had, a, large, following, among, the, urban, middle, class, king, henry, iii, at, first, tried, to, co, opt, the, head, of, the, catholic, league, and, steer, it, towards, a, negotiated, settlement, this, was, anathema, to, the, guise, leaders, who, wanted, to, bankrupt, the, huguenots, and, divide, their, considerable, assets, with, the, king, a, test, of, king, henry, iii, s, leadership, occurred, at, the, meeting, of, the, estates, general, at, blois, in, december, 1576, at, the, meeting, of, the, estates, general, there, was, only, one, huguenot, delegate, present, among, all, of, the, three, estates, the, rest, of, the, delegates, were, catholics, with, the, catholic, league, heavily, represented, accordingly, the, estates, general, pressured, henry, iii, into, conducting, a, war, against, the, huguenots, in, response, henry, said, he, would, reopen, hostilities, with, the, huguenots, but, wanted, the, estates, general, to, vote, him, the, funds, to, carry, out, the, war, yet, the, third, estate, refused, to, vote, for, the, necessary, taxes, to, fund, this, war, the, estates, general, of, 1576, failed, to, resolve, matters, and, by, december, the, huguenots, had, already, taken, up, arms, in, poitou, and, guyenne, while, the, guise, faction, had, the, unwavering, support, of, the, spanish, crown, the, huguenots, had, the, advantage, of, a, strong, power, base, in, the, southwest, they, were, also, discreetly, supported, by, foreign, protestant, governments, but, in, practice, england, or, the, german, states, could, provide, few, troops, in, the, ensuing, conflict, after, much, posturing, and, negotiations, henry, iii, rescinded, most, of, the, concessions, that, had, been, made, to, the, protestants, in, the, edict, of, beaulieu, with, the, treaty, of, bergerac, september, 1577, confirmed, in, the, edict, of, poitiers, passed, six, days, later, despite, henry, according, his, youngest, brother, francis, the, title, of, duke, of, anjou, the, prince, and, his, followers, continued, to, create, disorder, at, court, through, their, involvement, in, the, dutch, revolt, meanwhile, the, regional, situation, disintegrated, into, disorder, as, both, catholics, and, protestants, armed, themselves, in, self, defence, in, november, 1579, cond, seized, the, town, of, la, f, re, leading, to, another, round, of, military, action, which, was, brought, to, an, end, by, the, treaty, of, fleix, november, 1580, negotiated, by, anjou, the, fragile, compromise, came, to, an, end, in, 1584, when, the, duke, of, anjou, the, king, s, youngest, brother, and, heir, presumptive, died, as, henry, iii, had, no, son, under, salic, law, the, next, heir, to, the, throne, was, the, calvinist, prince, henry, of, navarre, a, descendant, of, louis, ix, when, it, became, clear, that, henry, of, navarre, would, not, renounce, his, protestantism, the, duke, of, guise, signed, the, treaty, of, joinville, 31, december, 1584, on, behalf, of, the, league, with, philip, ii, of, spain, who, supplied, a, considerable, annual, grant, to, the, league, over, the, following, decade, to, maintain, the, civil, war, in, france, with, the, hope, of, destroying, the, french, calvinists, under, pressure, from, the, guise, henry, iii, reluctantly, issued, the, treaty, of, nemours, 7, july, 1585, and, an, edict, suppressing, protestantism, 18, july, 1585, and, annulling, henry, of, navarre, s, right, to, the, throne, the, situation, degenerated, into, open, warfare, even, without, the, king, having, the, necessary, funds, henry, of, navarre, again, sought, foreign, aid, from, the, german, princes, and, elizabeth, i, of, england, meanwhile, the, solidly, catholic, people, of, paris, under, the, influence, of, the, committee, of, sixteen, were, becoming, dissatisfied, with, henry, iii, and, his, failure, to, defeat, the, calvinists, on, 12, may, 1588, the, day, of, the, barricades, a, popular, uprising, raised, barricades, on, the, streets, of, paris, to, defend, the, duke, of, guise, against, the, alleged, hostility, of, the, king, and, henry, iii, fled, the, city, the, committee, of, sixteen, took, complete, control, of, the, government, while, the, guise, protected, the, surrounding, supply, lines, the, mediation, of, catherine, de, medici, led, to, the, edict, of, union, in, which, the, crown, accepted, almost, all, the, league, s, demands, reaffirming, the, treaty, of, nemours, recognizing, cardinal, de, bourbon, as, heir, and, making, henry, of, guise, lieutenant, general, refusing, to, return, to, paris, henry, iii, called, for, an, estates, general, to, meet, at, blois, during, the, estates, general, henry, iii, suspected, that, the, members, of, the, third, estate, were, being, manipulated, by, the, league, and, became, convinced, that, guise, had, encouraged, the, duke, of, savoy, s, invasion, of, saluzzo, in, october, 1588, viewing, the, house, of, guise, as, a, dangerous, threat, to, the, power, of, the, crown, henry, iii, decided, to, strike, first, on, 23, december, 1588, at, the, ch, teau, de, blois, henry, of, guise, and, his, brother, the, cardinal, de, guise, were, lured, into, a, trap, by, the, king, s, guards, the, duke, arrived, in, the, council, chamber, where, his, brother, the, cardinal, waited, the, duke, was, told, that, the, king, wished, to, see, him, in, the, private, room, adjoining, the, royal, chambers, there, guardsmen, seized, the, duke, and, stabbed, him, in, the, heart, while, others, arrested, the, cardinal, who, later, died, on, the, pikes, of, his, escort, to, make, sure, that, no, contender, for, the, french, throne, was, free, to, act, against, him, the, king, had, the, duke, s, son, imprisoned, the, duke, of, guise, had, been, highly, popular, in, france, and, the, catholic, league, declared, open, war, against, king, henry, iii, the, sorbonne, declared, henri, deposed, henri, for, his, part, now, joined, forces, with, his, cousin, the, huguenot, henry, of, navarre, to, war, against, the, league, it, thus, fell, upon, the, younger, brother, of, the, duke, of, guise, the, duke, of, mayenne, to, lead, the, catholic, league, the, league, presses, began, printing, anti, royalist, tracts, under, a, variety, of, pseudonyms, while, the, sorbonne, proclaimed, on, 7, january, 1589, that, it, was, just, and, necessary, to, depose, henry, iii, and, that, any, private, citizen, was, morally, free, to, commit, regicide, in, july, 1589, in, the, royal, camp, at, saint, cloud, a, dominican, friar, named, jacques, cl, ment, gained, an, audience, with, the, king, and, drove, a, long, knife, into, his, spleen, cl, ment, was, killed, on, the, spot, taking, with, him, the, information, of, who, if, anyone, had, hired, him, on, his, deathbed, henry, iii, called, for, henry, of, navarre, and, begged, him, in, the, name, of, statecraft, to, become, a, catholic, citing, the, brutal, warfare, that, would, ensue, if, he, refused, in, keeping, with, salic, law, he, named, henry, as, his, heir, however, many, catholics, considered, navarre, s, protestantism, to, be, unacceptable, navarre, later, declared, that, he, would, uphold, the, catholic, faith, without, changes, the, state, of, affairs, in, 1589, was, that, henry, of, navarre, now, henry, iv, of, france, held, the, south, and, west, and, the, catholic, league, the, north, and, east, the, leadership, of, the, catholic, league, had, devolved, to, the, duke, de, mayenne, who, was, appointed, lieutenant, general, of, the, kingdom, he, and, his, troops, controlled, most, of, rural, normandy, however, in, september, 1589, henry, inflicted, a, severe, defeat, on, the, duke, at, the, battle, of, arques, henry, s, army, swept, through, normandy, taking, town, after, town, throughout, the, winter, the, king, knew, that, he, had, to, take, paris, if, he, stood, any, chance, of, ruling, all, of, france, this, however, was, no, easy, task, the, catholic, league, s, presses, and, supporters, continued, to, spread, stories, about, atrocities, committed, against, catholic, priests, and, the, laity, in, protestant, england, see, forty, martyrs, of, england, and, wales, the, city, prepared, to, fight, to, the, death, rather, than, accept, a, calvinist, king, the, battle, of, ivry, fought, on, 14, march, 1590, was, another, decisive, victory, for, henry, against, forces, led, by, the, duke, of, mayenne, henry, s, forces, then, went, on, to, besiege, paris, but, after, a, long, and, desperately, fought, resistance, by, the, parisians, henry, s, siege, was, lifted, by, a, spanish, army, under, the, command, of, the, duke, of, parma, then, what, had, happened, at, paris, was, repeated, at, rouen, november, 1591, march, 1592, parma, was, subsequently, wounded, in, the, hand, during, the, siege, of, caudebec, whilst, trapped, by, henry, s, army, having, then, made, a, miraculous, escape, from, there, he, withdrew, into, flanders, but, with, his, health, quickly, declining, farnese, called, his, son, ranuccio, to, command, his, troops, he, was, however, removed, from, the, position, of, governor, by, the, spanish, court, and, died, in, arras, on, 3, december, for, henry, and, the, protestant, army, at, least, parma, was, no, longer, a, threat, meanwhile, philippe, emmanuel, duke, of, merc, ur, whom, henry, iii, had, made, governor, of, brittany, in, 1582, was, endeavouring, to, make, himself, independent, in, that, province, a, leader, of, the, catholic, league, he, invoked, the, hereditary, rights, of, his, wife, marie, de, luxembourg, who, was, a, descendant, of, the, dukes, of, brittany, and, heiress, of, the, blois, brosse, claim, to, the, duchy, as, well, as, duchess, of, penthi, vre, in, brittany, and, organized, a, government, at, nantes, proclaiming, his, son, prince, and, duke, of, brittany, he, allied, with, philip, ii, of, spain, who, sought, to, place, his, own, daughter, infanta, isabella, clara, eugenia, on, the, throne, of, brittany, with, the, aid, of, the, spanish, under, juan, del, guila, merc, ur, defeated, henry, iv, s, forces, under, the, duke, of, montpensier, at, the, battle, of, craon, in, 1592, but, the, royal, troops, reinforced, by, english, contingents, soon, recovered, the, advantage, in, september, 1594, martin, frobisher, and, john, norris, with, eight, warships, and, 4, 000, men, besieged, fort, crozon, also, known, as, the, fort, of, the, lion, el, le, n, near, brest, and, captured, it, on, november, 7, killing, 400, spaniards, including, women, and, children, as, only, 13, survived, despite, the, campaigns, between, 1590, and, 1592, henry, iv, was, no, closer, to, capturing, paris, realising, that, henry, iii, had, been, right, and, that, there, was, no, prospect, of, a, protestant, king, succeeding, in, resolutely, catholic, paris, henry, agreed, to, convert, reputedly, stating, paris, vaut, bien, une, messe, paris, is, well, worth, a, mass, he, was, formally, received, into, the, catholic, church, in, 1593, and, was, crowned, at, chartres, in, 1594, as, league, members, maintained, control, of, the, cathedral, of, reims, and, sceptical, of, henry, s, sincerity, continued, to, oppose, him, he, was, finally, received, into, paris, in, march, 1594, and, 120, league, members, in, the, city, who, refused, to, submit, were, banished, from, the, capital, paris, capitulation, encouraged, the, same, of, many, other, towns, while, others, returned, to, support, the, crown, after, pope, clement, viii, absolved, henry, revoking, his, excommunication, in, return, for, the, publishing, of, the, tridentine, decrees, the, restoration, of, catholicism, in, b, arn, and, appointing, only, catholics, to, high, office, evidently, henry, s, conversion, worried, protestant, nobles, many, of, whom, had, until, then, hoped, to, win, not, just, concessions, but, a, complete, reformation, of, the, french, church, and, their, acceptance, of, henry, was, by, no, means, a, foregone, conclusion, by, the, end, of, 1594, certain, league, members, still, worked, against, henry, across, the, country, but, all, relied, on, spain, s, support, in, january, 1595, the, king, declared, war, on, spain, to, show, catholics, that, spain, was, using, religion, as, a, cover, for, an, attack, on, the, french, state, and, to, show, protestants, that, his, conversion, had, not, made, him, a, puppet, of, spain, also, he, hoped, to, reconquer, large, parts, of, northern, france, from, the, franco, spanish, catholic, forces, the, conflict, mostly, consisted, of, military, action, aimed, at, league, members, such, as, the, battle, of, fontaine, fran, aise, though, the, spanish, launched, a, concerted, offensive, in, 1595, taking, le, catelet, doullens, and, cambrai, the, latter, after, a, fierce, bombardment, and, in, the, spring, of, 1596, capturing, calais, by, april, following, the, spanish, capture, of, amiens, in, march, 1597, the, french, crown, laid, siege, until, its, surrender, in, september, with, that, victory, henry, s, concerns, then, turned, to, the, situation, in, brittany, where, he, promulgated, the, edict, of, nantes, and, sent, belli, vre, and, brulart, de, sillery, to, negotiate, a, peace, with, spain, the, war, was, drawn, to, an, official, close, after, the, edict, of, nantes, with, the, peace, of, vervins, in, may, 1598, in, early, 1598, the, king, marched, against, merc, ur, in, person, and, received, his, submission, at, angers, on, 20, march, 1598, merc, ur, subsequently, went, to, exile, in, hungary, merc, ur, s, daughter, and, heiress, was, married, to, the, duke, of, vend, me, an, illegitimate, son, of, henry, iv, henry, iv, was, faced, with, the, task, of, rebuilding, a, shattered, and, impoverished, kingdom, and, uniting, it, under, a, single, authority, henry, and, his, advisor, the, duke, of, sully, saw, that, the, essential, first, step, in, this, was, the, negotiation, of, the, edict, of, nantes, which, to, promote, civil, unity, granted, the, huguenots, substantial, rights, but, rather, than, being, a, sign, of, genuine, toleration, was, in, fact, a, kind, of, grudging, truce, between, the, religions, with, guarantees, for, both, sides, the, edict, can, be, said, to, mark, the, end, of, the, wars, of,
