https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals
the, vandals, were, a, germanic, people, who, first, inhabited, what, is, now, southern, poland, they, established, vandal, kingdoms, on, the, iberian, peninsula, mediterranean, islands, and, north, africa, in, the, fifth, century, the, vandals, migrated, to, the, area, between, the, lower, oder, and, vistula, rivers, in, the, second, century, bc, and, settled, in, silesia, from, around, 120, bc, they, are, associated, with, the, przeworsk, culture, and, were, possibly, the, same, people, as, the, lugii, expanding, into, dacia, during, the, marcomannic, wars, and, to, pannonia, during, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, the, vandals, were, confined, to, pannonia, by, the, goths, around, 330, ad, where, they, received, permission, to, settle, from, constantine, the, great, around, 400, raids, by, the, huns, from, the, east, forced, many, germanic, tribes, to, migrate, west, into, the, territory, of, the, roman, empire, and, fearing, that, they, might, be, targeted, next, the, vandals, were, also, pushed, westwards, crossing, the, rhine, into, gaul, along, with, other, tribes, in, 406, in, 409, the, vandals, crossed, the, pyrenees, into, the, iberian, peninsula, where, the, hasdingi, and, the, silingi, settled, in, gallaecia, northwest, iberia, and, baetica, south, central, iberia, on, the, orders, of, the, romans, the, visigoths, invaded, iberia, in, 418, they, almost, wiped, out, the, alans, and, silingi, vandals, who, voluntarily, subjected, themselves, to, the, rule, of, hasdingian, leader, gunderic, gunderic, was, then, pushed, from, gallaecia, to, baetica, by, a, roman, suebi, coalition, in, 419, in, 429, under, king, genseric, reigned, 428, 477, the, vandals, entered, north, africa, by, 439, they, established, a, kingdom, which, included, the, roman, province, of, africa, as, well, as, sicily, corsica, sardinia, malta, and, the, balearic, islands, they, fended, off, several, roman, attempts, to, recapture, the, african, province, and, sacked, the, city, of, rome, in, 455, their, kingdom, collapsed, in, the, vandalic, war, of, 533, 34, in, which, emperor, justinian, i, s, forces, reconquered, the, province, for, the, eastern, roman, empire, as, the, vandals, plundered, rome, for, fourteen, days, renaissance, and, early, modern, writers, characterized, the, vandals, as, prototypical, barbarians, this, led, to, the, use, of, the, term, vandalism, to, describe, any, pointless, destruction, particularly, the, barbarian, defacing, of, artwork, however, some, modern, historians, have, emphasised, the, role, of, vandals, as, continuators, of, aspects, of, roman, culture, in, the, transitional, period, from, late, antiquity, to, the, early, middle, ages, the, ethnonym, is, attested, as, wandali, and, wendilenses, by, saxo, as, vendill, in, old, norse, and, as, wend, e, las, in, old, english, all, going, back, to, a, proto, germanic, form, reconstructed, as, wan, ilaz, the, etymology, of, the, name, remains, unclear, according, to, linguist, vladimir, orel, it, may, stem, from, the, proto, germanic, adjective, wan, az, turned, twisted, itself, derived, from, the, verb, wen, anan, or, win, anan, meaning, to, wind, alternatively, it, has, been, derived, from, a, root, wan, meaning, water, based, on, the, idea, that, the, tribe, was, originally, located, near, the, limfjord, a, sea, inlet, in, denmark, the, stem, can, also, be, found, in, old, high, german, wentils, o, and, old, english, wendels, both, literally, meaning, vandal, sea, and, designating, the, mediterranean, sea, the, germanic, mythological, figure, of, aurvandill, has, been, interpreted, by, rudolf, much, to, mean, shining, vandal, much, forwarded, the, theory, that, the, tribal, name, vandal, reflects, worship, of, aurvandil, or, the, divine, twins, possibly, involving, an, origin, myth, that, the, vandalic, kings, were, descended, from, aurvandil, comparable, to, the, case, of, many, other, germanic, tribal, names, some, medieval, authors, equated, two, classical, ethnonyms, vandals, and, veneti, and, applied, both, to, west, slavs, leading, to, the, term, wends, which, has, been, used, for, various, slavic, speaking, groups, and, is, still, used, for, lusatians, however, modern, scholars, derive, wend, from, veneti, and, do, not, equate, the, veneti, and, vandals, the, name, of, the, vandals, has, been, connected, to, that, of, vendel, the, name, of, a, province, in, uppland, sweden, which, is, also, eponymous, of, the, vendel, period, of, swedish, prehistory, corresponding, to, the, late, germanic, iron, age, leading, up, to, the, viking, age, the, connection, is, considered, tenuous, at, best, and, more, plausibly, the, result, of, chance, though, scandinavia, is, considered, the, probable, homeland, of, the, tribe, prior, to, the, migration, period, as, the, vandals, eventually, came, to, live, outside, of, germania, they, were, not, considered, germani, by, ancient, roman, authors, neither, another, east, germanic, speaking, group, the, goths, nor, norsemen, early, scandinavians, were, counted, among, the, germani, by, the, romans, since, the, vandals, spoke, a, germanic, language, mainly, vandalic, and, belonged, to, early, germanic, culture, they, are, classified, as, a, germanic, people, by, modern, scholars, the, earliest, mention, of, the, vandals, is, from, pliny, the, elder, who, used, the, term, vandili, in, a, broad, way, to, define, one, of, the, major, groupings, of, all, germanic, peoples, tribes, within, this, category, who, he, mentions, are, the, burgundiones, varini, carini, otherwise, unknown, and, the, gutones, tacitus, mentioned, the, vandilii, but, only, in, a, passage, explaining, legends, about, the, origins, of, the, germanic, peoples, he, names, them, as, one, of, the, groups, sometimes, thought, to, be, one, of, the, oldest, divisions, of, these, peoples, along, with, the, marsi, gambrivii, suebi, but, does, not, say, where, they, live, or, which, peoples, are, within, this, category, on, the, other, hand, tacitus, and, ptolemy, give, information, about, the, position, of, varini, burgundians, and, gutones, in, this, period, and, these, indications, suggest, that, the, vandals, in, this, period, lived, between, the, oder, and, vistula, rivers, ptolemy, furthermore, mentioned, the, silingi, who, were, later, counted, as, vandals, as, living, south, of, the, semnones, who, were, suebians, living, on, the, elbe, and, stretching, to, the, oder, the, hasdingi, who, later, led, the, invasion, of, carthage, do, not, appear, in, written, records, until, the, 2nd, century, and, the, time, of, the, marcomannic, wars, the, lacringi, appear, in, 3rd, century, records, the, lugii, who, were, also, mentioned, in, early, classical, sources, in, the, same, region, are, likely, to, have, been, the, same, people, as, the, vandals, the, lugii, are, mentioned, by, strabo, tacitus, and, ptolemy, as, a, large, group, of, tribes, between, the, vistula, and, the, oder, strabo, and, ptolemy, do, not, mention, the, vandals, at, all, only, the, lugii, tacitus, mentions, them, in, a, passage, about, the, ancestry, of, the, germanic, peoples, without, saying, where, they, lived, and, pliny, the, elder, in, contrast, mentions, the, vandals, but, not, the, lugii, walter, pohl, and, walter, goffart, have, noted, that, ptolemy, seems, to, distinguish, the, silingi, from, the, lugii, and, in, the, 2nd, century, the, hasdings, when, they, appear, in, the, roman, record, are, also, distinguished, from, the, lugii, herwig, wolfram, notes, that, in, all, likelihood, the, lugians, and, the, vandals, were, one, cultic, community, that, lived, in, the, same, region, of, the, oder, in, silesia, where, it, was, first, under, celtic, and, then, under, germanic, domination, this, may, account, for, the, differentiation, between, the, celtic, lugii, and, their, more, germanic, successors, the, vandals, in, archaeology, the, vandals, are, associated, with, the, przeworsk, culture, but, the, culture, probably, extended, over, several, central, and, eastern, european, peoples, their, origin, ethnicity, and, linguistic, affiliation, are, heavily, debated, the, bearers, of, the, przeworsk, culture, mainly, practiced, cremation, and, occasionally, inhumation, very, little, is, known, about, the, vandalic, language, itself, but, it, is, believed, to, be, of, the, extinct, east, germanic, linguistic, branch, like, gothic, the, goths, left, behind, the, only, text, corpus, of, the, east, germanic, language, type, especially, a, 4th, century, translation, of, the, gospels, in, the, 2nd, century, two, or, three, distinct, vandal, peoples, came, to, the, attention, of, roman, authors, the, silingi, the, hasdingi, and, possibly, the, lacringi, who, appear, together, with, the, hasdingi, only, the, silingi, had, been, mentioned, in, early, roman, works, and, are, associated, with, silesia, these, peoples, appeared, during, the, marcomannic, wars, which, resulted, in, widespread, destruction, and, the, first, invasion, of, italy, in, the, roman, empire, period, during, the, marcomannic, wars, 166, 180, the, hasdingi, or, astingi, led, by, the, kings, raus, and, rapt, or, rhaus, and, raptus, moved, south, entering, dacia, as, allies, of, rome, however, they, eventually, caused, problems, in, dacia, and, moved, further, south, towards, the, lower, danube, area, together, with, the, hasdingi, were, the, lacringi, who, were, possibly, also, vandals, in, about, 271, ad, the, roman, emperor, aurelian, was, obliged, to, protect, the, middle, course, of, the, danube, against, vandals, they, made, peace, and, stayed, on, the, eastern, bank, of, the, danube, in, 278, zosimus, reported, that, emperor, probus, had, defeated, the, vandals, and, burgundians, near, a, river, sometimes, proposed, to, be, the, lech, and, sent, many, of, them, to, britain, during, this, same, period, the, 11th, panegyric, to, maximian, delivered, in, 291, reported, two, different, conflicts, outside, the, empire, wherein, burgundians, were, associated, with, alamanni, and, other, vandals, probably, hasdingi, in, the, carpathian, region, were, associated, with, gepids, according, to, jordanes, getica, the, hasdingi, came, into, conflict, with, the, goths, around, the, time, of, constantine, the, great, at, the, time, these, vandals, were, living, in, lands, later, inhabited, by, the, gepids, where, they, were, surrounded, on, the, east, the, goths, on, the, west, the, marcomanni, on, the, north, the, hermanduri, and, on, the, south, the, hister, danube, the, vandals, were, attacked, by, the, gothic, king, geberic, and, their, king, visimar, was, killed, the, vandals, then, migrated, to, neighbouring, pannonia, where, after, constantine, the, great, in, about, 330, granted, them, lands, on, the, right, bank, of, the, danube, they, lived, for, the, next, sixty, years, in, the, late, 4th, century, and, early, 5th, the, famous, magister, militum, stilicho, died, 408, the, chief, minister, of, the, emperor, honorius, was, described, as, being, of, vandal, descent, vandals, raided, the, roman, province, of, raetia, in, the, winter, of, 401, 402, from, this, historian, peter, heather, concludes, that, at, this, time, the, vandals, were, located, in, the, region, around, the, middle, and, upper, danube, it, is, possible, that, such, middle, danubian, vandals, were, part, of, the, gothic, king, radagaisus, invasion, of, italy, in, 405, 406, ad, while, the, hasdingian, vandals, were, already, established, in, the, middle, danube, for, centuries, it, is, less, clear, where, the, silingian, vandals, had, been, living, though, it, may, have, been, in, silesia, in, ad, 278, emperor, probus, on, defeating, the, vandals, and, burgundians, transferred, many, of, them, to, britain, it, is, unknown, where, they, were, settled, though, silchester, seems, to, be, a, likely, candidate, the, city, bears, the, name, of, the, silingi, is, only, one, of, six, that, existed, in, roman, britain, that, did, not, survive, the, sub, roman, era, and, appears, to, have, been, ritually, cursed, likely, by, the, anglo, saxons, before, being, abandoned, in, 405, ad, the, vandals, advanced, from, pannonia, travelling, west, along, the, danube, without, much, difficulty, but, when, they, reached, the, rhine, they, met, resistance, from, the, franks, who, populated, and, controlled, romanized, regions, in, northern, gaul, according, to, the, frigeridus, fragment, cited, by, gregory, of, tours, around, 20, 000, vandals, including, godigisel, himself, died, in, this, vandal, frankish, war, but, then, with, the, help, of, the, alans, they, managed, to, defeat, the, franks, and, on, december, 31, 405, the, vandals, crossed, the, rhine, probably, while, it, was, frozen, to, invade, gaul, which, they, devastated, terribly, under, godigisel, s, son, gunderic, the, vandals, plundered, their, way, westward, and, southward, through, aquitaine, on, october, 13, 409, they, crossed, the, pyrenees, into, the, iberian, peninsula, there, the, hasdingi, received, land, from, the, romans, as, foederati, in, asturia, northwest, and, the, silingi, in, hispania, baetica, south, while, the, alans, got, lands, in, lusitania, west, and, the, region, around, carthago, nova, the, suebi, also, controlled, part, of, gallaecia, the, visigoths, who, invaded, iberia, on, the, orders, of, the, romans, before, receiving, lands, in, septimania, southern, france, crushed, the, silingi, vandals, in, 417, and, the, alans, in, 418, killing, the, western, alan, king, attaces, the, remainder, of, his, people, and, the, remnants, of, the, silingi, who, were, nearly, wiped, out, subsequently, appealed, to, the, vandal, king, gunderic, to, accept, the, alan, crown, later, vandal, kings, in, north, africa, styled, themselves, rex, wandalorum, et, alanorum, king, of, the, vandals, and, alans, in, 419, ad, the, hasdingi, vandals, were, defeated, by, a, joint, roman, suebi, coalition, gunderic, fled, to, baetica, where, he, was, also, proclaimed, king, of, the, silingi, vandals, in, 422, gunderic, decisively, defeated, a, roman, suebi, gothic, coalition, led, by, the, roman, patrician, castinus, at, the, battle, of, tarraco, it, is, likely, that, many, roman, and, gothic, troops, deserted, to, gunderic, following, the, battle, for, the, next, five, years, according, to, hydatius, gunderic, created, widespread, havoc, in, the, western, mediterranean, in, 425, the, vandals, pillaged, the, balearic, islands, hispania, and, mauritania, sacking, cartagena, and, seville, in, 425, the, capture, of, the, maritime, city, of, cartagena, enabled, the, vandals, to, engage, in, widespread, naval, activities, in, 428, gunderic, captured, seville, for, a, second, time, but, died, while, laying, siege, to, the, city, s, church, he, was, succeeded, by, his, half, brother, genseric, who, although, he, was, illegitimate, his, mother, was, a, slave, had, held, a, prominent, position, at, the, vandal, court, rising, to, the, throne, unchallenged, in, 429, the, vandals, departed, spain, which, remained, almost, totally, in, roman, hands, until, 439, when, the, sueves, confined, to, gallaecia, moved, south, and, captured, emerita, augusta, m, rida, the, see, city, of, roman, administration, for, the, whole, peninsula, genseric, is, often, regarded, by, historians, as, the, most, able, barbarian, leader, of, the, migration, period, michael, frassetto, writes, that, he, probably, contributed, more, to, the, destruction, of, rome, than, any, of, his, contemporaries, although, the, barbarians, controlled, hispania, they, still, comprised, a, tiny, minority, among, a, much, larger, hispano, roman, population, approximately, 200, 000, out, of, 6, 000, 000, shortly, after, seizing, the, throne, genseric, was, attacked, from, the, rear, by, a, large, force, of, suebi, under, the, command, of, heremigarius, who, had, managed, to, take, lusitania, this, suebi, army, was, defeated, near, m, rida, and, its, leader, hermigarius, drowned, in, the, guadiana, river, while, trying, to, flee, it, is, possible, that, the, name, al, andalus, and, its, derivative, andalusia, is, derived, from, the, arabic, adoption, of, the, name, of, the, vandals, the, vandals, under, genseric, also, known, as, geiseric, crossed, to, africa, in, 429, although, numbers, are, unknown, and, some, historians, debate, the, validity, of, estimates, based, on, procopius, assertion, that, the, vandals, and, alans, numbered, 80, 000, when, they, moved, to, north, africa, peter, heather, estimates, that, they, could, have, fielded, an, army, of, around, 15, 000, 20, 000, according, to, procopius, the, vandals, came, to, africa, at, the, request, of, bonifacius, the, military, ruler, of, the, region, seeking, to, establish, himself, as, an, independent, ruler, in, africa, or, even, become, roman, emperor, bonifacius, had, defeated, several, roman, attempts, to, subdue, him, until, he, was, mastered, by, the, newly, appointed, gothic, count, of, africa, sigisvult, who, captured, both, hippo, regius, and, carthage, it, is, possible, that, bonifacius, had, sought, genseric, as, an, ally, against, sigisvult, promising, him, a, part, of, africa, in, return, advancing, eastwards, along, the, coast, the, vandals, were, confronted, on, the, numidian, border, in, may, june, 430, by, bonifacius, negotiations, broke, down, and, bonifacius, was, soundly, defeated, bonifacius, subsequently, barricaded, himself, inside, hippo, regius, with, the, vandals, besieging, the, city, inside, saint, augustine, and, his, priests, prayed, for, relief, from, the, invaders, knowing, full, well, that, the, fall, of, the, city, would, spell, conversion, or, death, for, many, roman, christians, on, 28, august, 430, three, months, into, the, siege, st, augustine, who, was, 75, years, old, died, perhaps, from, starvation, or, stress, as, the, wheat, fields, outside, the, city, lay, dormant, and, unharvested, the, death, of, augustine, shocked, the, regent, of, the, western, roman, empire, galla, placidia, who, feared, the, consequences, if, her, realm, lost, its, most, important, source, of, grain, she, raised, a, new, army, in, italy, and, convinced, her, nephew, in, constantinople, the, eastern, roman, emperor, theodosius, ii, to, send, an, army, to, north, africa, led, by, aspar, around, july, august, 431, genseric, raised, the, siege, of, hippo, regius, which, enabled, bonifacius, to, retreat, from, hippo, regius, to, carthage, where, he, was, joined, by, aspar, s, army, during, the, summer, of, 432, genseric, soundly, defeated, the, joint, forces, of, both, bonifacius, and, aspar, which, enabled, him, to, seize, hippo, regius, unopposed, genseric, and, aspar, subsequently, negotiated, a, peace, treaty, of, some, sorts, upon, seizing, hippo, regius, genseric, made, it, the, first, capital, of, the, vandal, kingdom, the, romans, and, the, vandals, concluded, a, treaty, in, 435, giving, the, vandals, control, of, the, mauretania, and, the, western, half, of, numidia, genseric, chose, to, break, the, treaty, in, 439, when, he, invaded, the, province, of, africa, proconsularis, and, seized, carthage, on, october, 19, the, city, was, captured, without, a, fight, the, vandals, entered, the, city, while, most, of, the, inhabitants, were, attending, the, races, at, the, hippodrome, genseric, made, it, his, capital, and, styled, himself, the, king, of, the, vandals, and, alans, to, denote, the, inclusion, of, the, alans, of, northern, africa, into, his, alliance, his, forces, also, occupied, sardinia, corsica, and, the, balearic, islands, his, siege, of, palermo, in, 440, was, a, failure, as, was, the, second, attempt, to, invade, sicily, near, agrigento, in, 442, the, vandals, occupied, the, island, from, 468, to, 476, when, it, was, ceded, to, odovacer, historian, cameron, suggests, that, the, new, vandal, rule, may, not, have, been, unwelcomed, by, the, population, of, north, africa, as, the, great, landowners, were, generally, unpopular, the, impression, given, by, ancient, sources, such, as, victor, of, vita, quodvultdeus, and, fulgentius, of, ruspe, was, that, the, vandal, take, over, of, carthage, and, north, africa, led, to, widespread, destruction, however, recent, archaeological, investigations, have, challenged, this, assertion, although, carthage, s, odeon, was, destroyed, the, street, pattern, remained, the, same, and, some, public, buildings, were, renovated, the, political, centre, of, carthage, was, the, byrsa, hill, new, industrial, centres, emerged, within, towns, during, this, period, historian, andy, merrills, uses, the, large, amounts, of, african, red, slip, ware, discovered, across, the, mediterranean, dating, from, the, vandal, period, of, north, africa, to, challenge, the, assumption, that, the, vandal, rule, of, north, africa, was, a, time, of, economic, instability, when, the, vandals, raided, sicily, in, 440, the, western, roman, empire, was, too, preoccupied, with, war, with, gaul, to, react, theodosius, ii, emperor, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, dispatched, an, expedition, to, deal, with, the, vandals, in, 441, however, it, only, progressed, as, far, as, sicily, the, western, empire, under, valentinian, iii, secured, peace, with, the, vandals, in, 442, under, the, treaty, the, vandals, gained, byzacena, tripolitania, and, the, eastern, half, of, numidia, and, were, confirmed, in, control, of, proconsular, africa, as, well, as, the, vandal, kingdom, as, the, first, barbarian, kingdom, was, officially, recognized, as, an, independent, kingdom, in, former, roman, territory, instead, of, foederati, the, empire, retained, western, numidia, and, the, two, mauretanian, provinces, until, 455, during, the, next, thirty, five, years, with, a, large, fleet, genseric, looted, the, coasts, of, the, eastern, and, western, empires, vandal, activity, in, the, mediterranean, was, so, substantial, that, the, sea, s, name, in, old, english, was, wendels, i, e, sea, of, the, vandals, after, attila, the, hun, s, death, however, the, romans, could, afford, to, turn, their, attention, back, to, the, vandals, who, were, in, control, of, some, of, the, richest, lands, of, their, former, empire, in, an, effort, to, bring, the, vandals, into, the, fold, of, the, empire, valentinian, iii, offered, his, daughter, s, hand, in, marriage, to, genseric, s, son, before, this, treaty, could, be, carried, out, however, politics, again, played, a, crucial, part, in, the, blunders, of, rome, petronius, maximus, killed, valentinian, iii, and, claimed, the, western, throne, petronius, then, forced, valentinian, iii, s, widow, empress, licinia, eudoxia, to, marry, him, diplomacy, between, the, two, factions, broke, down, and, in, 455, with, a, letter, from, licinia, eudoxia, begging, genseric, s, son, to, rescue, her, the, vandals, took, rome, along, with, the, empress, and, her, daughters, eudocia, and, placidia, the, chronicler, prosper, of, aquitaine, offers, the, only, fifth, century, report, that, on, 2, june, 455, pope, leo, the, great, received, genseric, and, implored, him, to, abstain, from, murder, and, destruction, by, fire, and, to, be, satisfied, with, pillage, whether, the, pope, s, influence, saved, rome, is, however, questioned, the, vandals, departed, with, countless, valuables, eudoxia, and, her, daughter, eudocia, were, taken, to, north, africa, in, 456, a, vandal, fleet, of, 60, ships, threatening, both, gaul, and, italy, was, ambushed, and, defeated, at, agrigentum, and, corsica, by, the, western, roman, general, ricimer, in, 457, a, mixed, vandal, berber, army, returning, with, loot, from, a, raid, in, campania, were, soundly, defeated, in, a, surprise, attack, by, western, emperor, majorian, at, the, mouth, of, the, garigliano, river, as, a, result, of, the, vandal, sack, of, rome, and, piracy, in, the, mediterranean, it, became,

denomination, coins, the, high, denomination, imperial, money, was, retained, demonstrating, in, the, words, of, merrills, reluctance, to, usurp, the, imperial, prerogative, although, the, vandals, had, fended, off, attacks, from, the, romans, and, established, hegemony, over, the, islands, of, the, western, mediterranean, they, were, less, successful, in, their, conflict, with, the, berbers, situated, south, of, the, vandal, kingdom, the, berbers, inflicted, two, major, defeats, on, the, vandals, in, the, period, 496, 530, differences, between, the, arian, vandals, and, their,

laymen, were, excluded, from, office, and, frequently, suffered, confiscation, of, their, property, he, protected, his, catholic, subjects, when, his, relations, with, rome, and, constantinople, were, friendly, as, during, the, years, 454, 57, when, the, catholic, community, at, carthage, being, without, a, head, elected, deogratias, bishop, the, same, was, also, the, case, during, the, years, 476, 477, when, bishop, victor, of, cartenna, sent, him, during, a, period, of, peace, a, sharp, refutation, of, arianism, and, suffered, no, punishment, huneric, genseric, s, successor, issued, edicts, against, catholics, in, 483, and, 484, in, an, effort, to, marginalise, them, and, make, arianism, the, primary, religion, in, north, africa, generally, most, vandal, kings, except, hilderic, persecuted, trinitarian, christians, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, banning, conversion, for, vandals, exiling, bishops, and, generally, making, life, difficult, for, trinitarians, according, to, the, 1913, catholic, encyclopedia, genseric, one, of, the, most, powerful, personalities, of, the, era, of, the, migrations, died, on, 25, january, 477, at, the, great, age, of, around, 88, years, according, to, the, law, of, succession, which, he, had, promulgated, the, oldest, male, member, of, the, royal, house, was, to, succeed, thus, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, huneric, 477, 484, who, at, first, tolerated, catholics, owing, to, his, fear, of, constantinople, but, after, 482, began, to, persecute, manichaeans, and, catholics, gunthamund, 484, 496, his, cousin, and, successor, sought, internal, peace, with, the, catholics, and, ceased, persecution, once, more, externally, the, vandal, power, had, been, declining, since, genseric, s, death, and, gunthamund, lost, early, in, his, reign, all, but, a, small, wedge, of, western, sicily, to, the, ostrogoths, which, was, lost, in, 491, and, had, to, withstand, increasing, pressure, from, the, autochthonous, moors, according, to, the, 1913, catholic, encyclopedia, while, thrasamund, 496, 523, owing, to, his, religious, fanaticism, was, hostile, to, catholics, he, contented, himself, with, bloodless, persecutions, hilderic, 523, 530, was, the, vandal, king, most, tolerant, towards, the, catholic, church, he, granted, it, religious, freedom, consequently, catholic, synods, were, once, more, held, in, north, africa, however, he, had, little, interest, in, war, and, left, it, to, a, family, member, hoamer, when, hoamer, suffered, a, defeat, against, the, moors, the, arian, faction, within, the, royal, family, led, a, revolt, raising, the, banner, of, national, arianism, and, his, cousin, gelimer, 530, 534, became, king, hilderic, hoamer, and, their, relatives, were, thrown, into, prison, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, declared, war, with, the, stated, intention, of, restoring, hilderic, to, the, vandal, throne, the, deposed, hilderic, was, murdered, in, 533, on, gelimer, s, orders, while, an, expedition, was, en, route, a, large, part, of, the, vandal, army, and, navy, was, led, by, tzazo, gelimer, s, brother, to, sardinia, to, deal, with, a, rebellion, as, a, result, the, armies, of, the, byzantine, empire, commanded, by, belisarius, were, able, to, land, unopposed, 10, miles, 16, km, from, carthage, gelimer, quickly, assembled, an, army, and, met, belisarius, at, the, battle, of, ad, decimum, the, vandals, were, winning, the, battle, until, gelimer, s, brother, ammatas, and, nephew, gibamund, fell, in, battle, gelimer, then, lost, heart, and, fled, belisarius, quickly, took, carthage, while, the, surviving, vandals, fought, on, on, december, 15, 533, gelimer, and, belisarius, clashed, again, at, the, battle, of, tricamarum, some, 20, miles, 32, km, from, carthage, again, the, vandals, fought, well, but, broke, this, time, when, gelimer, s, brother, tzazo, fell, in, battle, belisarius, quickly, advanced, to, hippo, second, city, of, the, vandal, kingdom, and, in, 534, gelimer, surrendered, to, the, byzantine, conqueror, ending, the, kingdom, of, the, vandals, north, africa, comprising, north, tunisia, and, eastern, algeria, in, the, vandal, period, became, a, roman, province, again, from, which, the, vandals, were, expelled, many, vandals, went, to, saldae, today, called, b, ja, a, in, north, algeria, where, they, integrated, themselves, with, the, berbers, many, others, were, put, into, imperial, service, or, fled, to, the, two, gothic, kingdoms, ostrogothic, kingdom, and, visigothic, kingdom, some, vandal, women, married, byzantine, soldiers, and, settled, in, north, algeria, and, tunisia, the, choicest, vandal, warriors, were, formed, into, five, cavalry, regiments, known, as, vandali, iustiniani, stationed, on, the, persian, frontier, some, entered, the, private, service, of, belisarius, the, 1913, catholic, encyclopedia, states, that, gelimer, was, honourably, treated, and, received, large, estates, in, galatia, he, was, also, offered, the, rank, of, a, patrician, but, had, to, refuse, it, because, he, was, not, willing, to, change, his, arian, faith, in, the, words, of, historian, roger, collins, the, remaining, vandals, were, then, shipped, back, to, constantinople, to, be, absorbed, into, the, imperial, army, as, a, distinct, ethnic, unit, they, disappeared, some, of, the, few, vandals, remained, at, north, africa, while, more, migrated, back, to, spain, in, 546, the, vandalic, dux, of, numidia, guntarith, defected, from, the, byzantines, and, raised, a, rebellion, with, moorish, support, he, was, able, to, capture, carthage, but, was, assassinated, by, the, byzantines, shortly, afterwards, known, kings, of, the, vandals, all, vandals, that, modern, historians, know, about, were, able, to, speak, latin, which, also, remained, the, official, language, of, the, vandal, administration, most, of, the, staff, seems, to, have, been, native, berber, roman, levels, of, literacy, in, the, ancient, world, are, uncertain, but, writing, was, integral, to, administration, and, business, studies, of, literacy, in, north, africa, have, tended, to, centre, around, the, administration, which, was, limited, to, the, social, elite, however, the, majority, of, the, population, of, north, africa, did, not, live, in, urban, centres, judith, george, explains, that, analysis, of, the, poems, in, their, context, holds, up, a, mirror, to, the, ways, and, values, of, the, times, very, little, work, of, the, poets, of, vandal, north, africa, survives, but, what, does, is, found, in, the, latin, anthology, apart, from, their, names, little, is, known, about, the, poets, themselves, not, even, when, they, were, writing, their, work, drew, on, earlier, roman, traditions, modern, scholars, generally, hold, the, view, that, the, vandals, allowed, the, romans, in, north, africa, to, carry, on, with, their, way, of, life, with, only, occasional, interference, since, the, middle, ages, kings, of, denmark, were, styled, king, of, denmark, the, goths, and, the, wends, the, wends, being, a, group, of, west, slavs, formerly, living, in, mecklenburg, and, eastern, holstein, in, modern, germany, the, title, king, of, the, wends, is, translated, as, vandalorum, rex, in, latin, the, title, was, shortened, to, king, of, denmark, in, 1972, starting, in, 1540, swedish, kings, following, denmark, were, styled, suecorum, gothorum, et, vandalorum, rex, king, of, the, swedes, geats, and, wends, carl, xvi, gustaf, dropped, the, title, in, 1973, and, now, styles, himself, simply, as, king, of, sweden, the, modern, term, vandalism, stems, from, the, vandals, reputation, as, the, barbarian, people, who, sacked, and, looted, rome, in, ad, 455, the, vandals, were, probably, not, any, more, destructive, than, other, invaders, of, ancient, times, but, writers, who, idealized, rome, often, blamed, them, for, its, destruction, for, example, english, restoration, poet, john, dryden, wrote, till, goths, and, vandals, a, rude, northern, race, did, all, the, matchless, monuments, deface, the, term, vandalisme, was, coined, in, 1794, by, henri, gr, goire, bishop, of, blois, to, describe, the, destruction, of, artwork, following, the, french, revolution, the, term, was, quickly, adopted, across, europe, this, new, use, of, the, term, was, important, in, colouring, the, perception, of, the, vandals, from, later, late, antiquity, popularizing, the, pre, existing, idea, that, they, were, a, barbaric, group, with, a, taste, for, destruction, vandals, and, other, barbarian, groups, had, long, been, blamed, for, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, by, writers, and, historians, attribution
