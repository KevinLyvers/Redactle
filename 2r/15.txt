history, but, east, asian, studies, scholars, maintain, that, the, region, is, also, characterized, by, a, distinct, pattern, of, historical, development, this, is, evident, in, the, relationships, among, traditional, east, asian, civilizations, which, not, only, involve, the, sum, total, of, historical, patterns, but, also, a, specific, set, of, patterns, that, has, affected, all, or, most, of,

the, northern, zhou, and, northern, qi, in, the, south, the, dynasties, were, much, less, stable, than, the, northern, dynasties, the, four, southern, dynasties, were, weakened, by, conflicts, between, the, ruling, families, buddhism, also, one, of, the, major, religions, in, east, asia, was, introduced, into, china, during, the, han, dynasty, from, nepal, in, the, 1st, century, bc, buddhism, was, originally, introduced, to, korea, from, china, in, 372, and, eventually, arrived, in, japan, around, the, turn, of, the, 6th, century, for, a, long, time, buddhism, remained, a, foreign, religion, with, a, few, believers, in, china, during, the, tang, dynasty, a, fair, amount, of, translations, from, sanskrit, into, chinese, were, done, by, chinese, priests, and, buddhism, became, one, of, the, major, religions, of, the, chinese, along, with, the, other, two, indigenous, religions, in, korea, buddhism, was, not, seen, to, conflict, with, the, rites, of, nature, worship, it, was, allowed, to, blend, in, with, shamanism, thus, the, mountains, that, were, believed, to, be, the, residence, of, spirits, in, pre, buddhist, times, became, the, sites, of, buddhist, temples, though, buddhism, initially, enjoyed, wide, acceptance, even, being, supported, as, the, state, ideology, during, the, goguryeo, silla, baekje, balhae, and, goryeo, periods, buddhism, in, korea, suffered, extreme, repression, during, the, joseon, dynasty, in, japan, buddhism, and, shinto, were, combined, using, the, theological, theory, ry, bushint, which, says, shinto, deities, are, avatars, of, various, buddhist, entities, including, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, shinbutsu, sh, g, this, became, the, mainstream, notion, of, japanese, religion, in, fact, until, the, meiji, government,

designed, to, draw, the, best, talents, into, government, but, perhaps, an, even, greater, consideration, for, the, tang, rulers, aware, that, imperial, dependence, on, powerful, aristocratic, families, and, warlords, would, have, destabilizing, consequences, was, to, create, a, body, of, career, officials, having, no, autonomous, territorial, or, functional, power, base, as, it, turned, out, these, scholar, officials, acquired, status, in, their, local, communities, family, ties, and, shared, values, that, connected, them, to, the, imperial, court, from, tang, times, until, the,
