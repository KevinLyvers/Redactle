the, history, of, biology, traces, the, study, of, the, living, world, from, ancient, to, modern, times, although, the, concept, of, biology, as, a, single, coherent, field, arose, in, the, 19th, century, the, biological, sciences, emerged, from, traditions, of, medicine, and, natural, history, reaching, back, to, ayurveda, ancient, egyptian, medicine, and, the, works, of, aristotle, theophrastus, and, galen, in, the, ancient, greco, roman, world, this, ancient, work, was, further, developed, in, the, middle, ages, by, muslim, physicians, and, scholars, such, as, avicenna, during, the, european, renaissance, and, early, modern, period, biological, thought, was, revolutionized, in, europe, by, a, renewed, interest, in, empiricism, and, the, discovery, of, many, novel, organisms, prominent, in, this, movement, were, vesalius, and, harvey, who, used, experimentation, and, careful, observation, in, physiology, and, naturalists, such, as, linnaeus, and, buffon, who, began, to, classify, the, diversity, of, life, and, the, fossil, record, as, well, as, the, development, and, behavior, of, organisms, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, revealed, by, means, of, microscopy, the, previously, unknown, world, of, microorganisms, laying, the, groundwork, for, cell, theory, the, growing, importance, of, natural, theology, partly, a, response, to, the, rise, of, mechanical, philosophy, encouraged, the, growth, of, natural, history, although, it, entrenched, the, argument, from, design, over, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, biological, sciences, such, as, botany, and, zoology, became, increasingly, professional, scientific, disciplines, lavoisier, and, other, physical, scientists, began, to, connect, the, animate, and, inanimate, worlds, through, physics, and, chemistry, explorer, naturalists, such, as, alexander, von, humboldt, investigated, the, interaction, between, organisms, and, their, environment, and, the, ways, this, relationship, depends, on, geography, laying, the, foundations, for, biogeography, ecology, and, ethology, naturalists, began, to, reject, essentialism, and, consider, the, importance, of, extinction, and, the, mutability, of, species, cell, theory, provided, a, new, perspective, on, the, fundamental, basis, of, life, these, developments, as, well, as, the, results, from, embryology, and, paleontology, were, synthesized, in, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, saw, the, fall, of, spontaneous, generation, and, the, rise, of, the, germ, theory, of, disease, though, the, mechanism, of, inheritance, remained, a, mystery, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, rediscovery, of, mendel, s, work, in, botany, by, carl, correns, led, to, the, rapid, development, of, genetics, applied, to, fruit, flies, by, thomas, hunt, morgan, and, his, students, and, by, the, 1930s, the, combination, of, population, genetics, and, natural, selection, in, the, neo, darwinian, synthesis, new, disciplines, developed, rapidly, especially, after, watson, and, crick, proposed, the, structure, of, dna, following, the, establishment, of, the, central, dogma, and, the, cracking, of, the, genetic, code, biology, was, largely, split, between, organismal, biology, the, fields, that, deal, with, whole, organisms, and, groups, of, organisms, and, the, fields, related, to, cellular, and, molecular, biology, by, the, late, 20th, century, new, fields, like, genomics, and, proteomics, were, reversing, this, trend, with, organismal, biologists, using, molecular, techniques, and, molecular, and, cell, biologists, investigating, the, interplay, between, genes, and, the, environment, as, well, as, the, genetics, of, natural, populations, of, organisms, the, earliest, humans, must, have, had, and, passed, on, knowledge, about, plants, and, animals, to, increase, their, chances, of, survival, this, may, have, included, knowledge, of, human, and, animal, anatomy, and, aspects, of, animal, behavior, such, as, migration, patterns, however, the, first, major, turning, point, in, biological, knowledge, came, with, the, neolithic, revolution, about, 10, 000, years, ago, humans, first, domesticated, plants, for, farming, then, livestock, animals, to, accompany, the, resulting, sedentary, societies, between, around, 3000, and, 1200, bce, the, ancient, egyptians, and, mesopotamians, made, contributions, to, astronomy, mathematics, and, medicine, which, later, entered, and, shaped, greek, natural, philosophy, of, classical, antiquity, a, period, that, profoundly, influenced, the, development, of, what, came, to, be, known, as, biology, over, a, dozen, medical, papyri, have, been, preserved, most, notably, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, the, oldest, extant, surgical, handbook, and, the, ebers, papyrus, a, handbook, of, preparing, and, using, materia, medica, for, various, diseases, both, from, around, 1600, bce, ancient, egypt, is, also, known, for, developing, embalming, which, was, used, for, mummification, in, order, to, preserve, human, remains, and, forestall, decomposition, the, mesopotamians, seem, to, have, had, little, interest, in, the, natural, world, as, such, preferring, to, study, how, the, gods, had, ordered, the, universe, animal, physiology, was, studied, for, divination, including, especially, the, anatomy, of, the, liver, seen, as, an, important, organ, in, haruspicy, animal, behavior, too, was, studied, for, divinatory, purposes, most, information, about, the, training, and, domestication, of, animals, was, probably, transmitted, orally, but, one, text, dealing, with, the, training, of, horses, has, survived, the, ancient, mesopotamians, had, no, distinction, between, rational, science, and, magic, when, a, person, became, ill, doctors, prescribed, both, magical, formulas, to, be, recited, and, medicinal, treatments, the, earliest, medical, prescriptions, appear, in, sumerian, during, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, c, 2112, c, 2004, bce, the, most, extensive, babylonian, medical, text, however, is, the, diagnostic, handbook, written, by, the, umm, n, or, chief, scholar, esagil, kin, apli, of, borsippa, during, the, reign, of, the, babylonian, king, adad, apla, iddina, 1069, 1046, bce, in, east, semitic, cultures, the, main, medicinal, authority, was, an, exorcist, healer, known, as, an, ipu, the, profession, was, passed, down, from, father, to, son, and, was, held, in, high, regard, of, less, frequent, recourse, was, the, asu, a, healer, who, treated, physical, symptoms, using, remedies, composed, of, herbs, animal, products, and, minerals, as, well, as, potions, enemas, and, ointments, or, poultices, these, physicians, who, could, be, either, male, or, female, also, dressed, wounds, set, limbs, and, performed, simple, surgeries, the, ancient, mesopotamians, also, practiced, prophylaxis, and, took, measures, to, prevent, the, spread, of, disease, observations, and, theories, regarding, nature, and, human, health, separate, from, western, traditions, had, emerged, independently, in, other, civilizations, such, as, those, in, china, and, the, indian, subcontinent, in, ancient, china, earlier, conceptions, can, be, found, dispersed, across, several, different, disciplines, including, the, work, of, herbologists, physicians, alchemists, and, philosophers, the, taoist, tradition, of, chinese, alchemy, for, example, emphasized, health, with, the, ultimate, goal, being, the, elixir, of, life, the, system, of, classical, chinese, medicine, usually, revolved, around, the, theory, of, yin, and, yang, and, the, five, phases, taoist, philosophers, such, as, zhuangzi, in, the, 4th, century, bce, also, expressed, ideas, related, to, evolution, such, as, denying, the, fixity, of, biological, species, and, speculating, that, species, had, developed, differing, attributes, in, response, to, differing, environments, one, of, the, oldest, organised, systems, of, medicine, is, known, from, ancient, india, in, the, form, of, ayurveda, which, originated, around, 1500, bce, from, atharvaveda, one, of, the, four, most, ancient, books, of, indian, knowledge, wisdom, and, culture, the, ancient, indian, ayurveda, tradition, independently, developed, the, concept, of, three, humours, resembling, that, of, the, four, humours, of, ancient, greek, medicine, though, the, ayurvedic, system, included, further, complications, such, as, the, body, being, composed, of, five, elements, and, seven, basic, tissues, ayurvedic, writers, also, classified, living, things, into, four, categories, based, on, the, method, of, birth, from, the, womb, eggs, heat, moisture, and, seeds, and, explained, the, conception, of, a, fetus, in, detail, they, also, made, considerable, advances, in, the, field, of, surgery, often, without, the, use, of, human, dissection, or, animal, vivisection, one, of, the, earliest, ayurvedic, treatises, was, the, sushruta, samhita, attributed, to, sushruta, in, the, 6th, century, bce, it, was, also, an, early, materia, medica, describing, 700, medicinal, plants, 64, preparations, from, mineral, sources, and, 57, preparations, based, on, animal, sources, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, asked, many, questions, about, life, but, produced, little, systematic, knowledge, of, specifically, biological, interest, though, the, attempts, of, the, atomists, to, explain, life, in, purely, physical, terms, would, recur, periodically, through, the, history, of, biology, however, the, medical, theories, of, hippocrates, and, his, followers, especially, humorism, had, a, lasting, impact, the, philosopher, aristotle, was, the, most, influential, scholar, of, the, living, world, from, classical, antiquity, though, his, early, work, in, natural, philosophy, was, speculative, aristotle, s, later, biological, writings, were, more, empirical, focusing, on, biological, causation, and, the, diversity, of, life, he, made, countless, observations, of, nature, especially, the, habits, and, attributes, of, plants, and, animals, in, the, world, around, him, which, he, devoted, considerable, attention, to, categorizing, in, all, aristotle, classified, 540, animal, species, and, dissected, at, least, 50, he, believed, that, intellectual, purposes, formal, causes, guided, all, natural, processes, aristotle, s, successor, at, the, lyceum, theophrastus, wrote, a, series, of, books, on, botany, the, history, of, plants, which, survived, as, the, most, important, contribution, of, antiquity, to, botany, even, into, the, middle, ages, many, of, theophrastus, names, survive, into, modern, times, such, as, karp, s, for, fruit, and, perik, rpion, for, seed, vessel, dioscorides, wrote, a, pioneering, and, encyclopedic, pharmacopoeia, de, materia, medica, incorporating, descriptions, of, some, 600, plants, and, their, uses, in, medicine, pliny, the, elder, in, his, natural, history, assembled, a, similarly, encyclopaedic, account, of, things, in, nature, including, accounts, of, many, plants, and, animals, aristotle, and, nearly, all, western, scholars, after, him, until, the, 18th, century, believed, that, creatures, were, arranged, in, a, graded, scale, of, perfection, rising, from, plants, on, up, to, humans, the, scala, naturae, or, great, chain, of, being, a, few, scholars, in, the, hellenistic, period, under, the, ptolemies, particularly, herophilus, of, chalcedon, and, erasistratus, of, chios, amended, aristotle, s, physiological, work, even, performing, dissections, and, vivisections, claudius, galen, became, the, most, important, authority, on, medicine, and, anatomy, though, a, few, ancient, atomists, such, as, lucretius, challenged, the, teleological, aristotelian, viewpoint, that, all, aspects, of, life, are, the, result, of, design, or, purpose, teleology, and, after, the, rise, of, christianity, natural, theology, would, remain, central, to, biological, thought, essentially, until, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, ernst, w, mayr, argued, that, nothing, of, any, real, consequence, happened, in, biology, after, lucretius, and, galen, until, the, renaissance, the, ideas, of, the, greek, traditions, of, natural, history, and, medicine, survived, but, they, were, generally, taken, unquestioningly, in, medieval, europe, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, led, to, the, disappearance, or, destruction, of, much, knowledge, though, physicians, still, incorporated, many, aspects, of, the, greek, tradition, into, training, and, practice, in, byzantium, and, the, islamic, world, many, of, the, greek, works, were, translated, into, arabic, and, many, of, the, works, of, aristotle, were, preserved, during, the, high, middle, ages, a, few, european, scholars, such, as, hildegard, of, bingen, albertus, magnus, and, frederick, ii, wrote, on, natural, history, the, rise, of, european, universities, though, important, for, the, development, of, physics, and, philosophy, had, little, impact, on, biological, scholarship, the, european, renaissance, brought, expanded, interest, in, both, empirical, natural, history, and, physiology, in, 1543, andreas, vesalius, inaugurated, the, modern, era, of, western, medicine, with, his, seminal, human, anatomy, treatise, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, which, was, based, on, dissection, of, corpses, vesalius, was, the, first, in, a, series, of, anatomists, who, gradually, replaced, scholasticism, with, empiricism, in, physiology, and, medicine, relying, on, first, hand, experience, rather, than, authority, and, abstract, reasoning, via, herbalism, medicine, was, also, indirectly, the, source, of, renewed, empiricism, in, the, study, of, plants, otto, brunfels, hieronymus, bock, and, leonhart, fuchs, wrote, extensively, on, wild, plants, the, beginning, of, a, nature, based, approach, to, the, full, range, of, plant, life, bestiaries, a, genre, that, combines, both, the, natural, and, figurative, knowledge, of, animals, also, became, more, sophisticated, especially, with, the, work, of, william, turner, pierre, belon, guillaume, rondelet, conrad, gessner, and, ulisse, aldrovandi, artists, such, as, albrecht, d, rer, and, leonardo, da, vinci, often, working, with, naturalists, were, also, interested, in, the, bodies, of, animals, and, humans, studying, physiology, in, detail, and, contributing, to, the, growth, of, anatomical, knowledge, the, traditions, of, alchemy, and, natural, magic, especially, in, the, work, of, paracelsus, also, laid, claim, to, knowledge, of, the, living, world, alchemists, subjected, organic, matter, to, chemical, analysis, and, experimented, liberally, with, both, biological, and, mineral, pharmacology, this, was, part, of, a, larger, transition, in, world, views, the, rise, of, the, mechanical, philosophy, that, continued, into, the, 17th, century, as, the, traditional, metaphor, of, nature, as, organism, was, replaced, by, the, nature, as, machine, metaphor, systematizing, naming, and, classifying, dominated, natural, history, throughout, much, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, carl, linnaeus, published, a, basic, taxonomy, for, the, natural, world, in, 1735, variations, of, which, have, been, in, use, ever, since, and, in, the, 1750s, introduced, scientific, names, for, all, his, species, while, linnaeus, conceived, of, species, as, unchanging, parts, of, a, designed, hierarchy, the, other, great, naturalist, of, the, 18th, century, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, treated, species, as, artificial, categories, and, living, forms, as, malleable, even, suggesting, the, possibility, of, common, descent, though, he, was, opposed, to, evolution, buffon, is, a, key, figure, in, the, history, of, evolutionary, thought, his, work, would, influence, the, evolutionary, theories, of, both, lamarck, and, darwin, the, discovery, and, description, of, new, species, and, the, collection, of, specimens, became, a, passion, of, scientific, gentlemen, and, a, lucrative, enterprise, for, entrepreneurs, many, naturalists, traveled, the, globe, in, search, of, scientific, knowledge, and, adventure, extending, the, work, of, vesalius, into, experiments, on, still, living, bodies, of, both, humans, and, animals, william, harvey, and, other, natural, philosophers, investigated, the, roles, of, blood, veins, and, arteries, harvey, s, de, motu, cordis, in, 1628, was, the, beginning, of, the, end, for, galenic, theory, and, alongside, santorio, santorio, s, studies, of, metabolism, it, served, as, an, influential, model, of, quantitative, approaches, to, physiology, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, micro, world, of, biology, was, just, beginning, to, open, up, a, few, lensmakers, and, natural, philosophers, had, been, creating, crude, microscopes, since, the, late, 16th, century, and, robert, hooke, published, the, seminal, micrographia, based, on, observations, with, his, own, compound, microscope, in, 1665, but, it, was, not, until, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, s, dramatic, improvements, in, lensmaking, beginning, in, the, 1670s, ultimately, producing, up, to, 200, fold, magnification, with, a, single, lens, that, scholars, discovered, spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria, and, the, sheer, strangeness, and, diversity, of, microscopic, life, similar, investigations, by, jan, swammerdam, led, to, a, new, interest, in, entomology, and, built, the, basic, techniques, of, microscopic, dissection, and, staining, as, the, microscopic, world, was, expanding, the, macroscopic, world, was, shrinking, botanists, such, as, john, ray, worked, to, incorporate, the, flood, of, newly, discovered, organisms, shipped, from, across, the, globe, into, a, coherent, taxonomy, and, a, coherent, theology, natural, theology, debate, over, another, flood, the, noachian, catalyzed, the, development, of, paleontology, in, 1669, nicholas, steno, published, an, essay, on, how, the, remains, of, living, organisms, could, be, trapped, in, layers, of, sediment, and, mineralized, to, produce, fossils, although, steno, s, ideas, about, fossilization, were, well, known, and, much, debated, among, natural, philosophers, an, organic, origin, for, all, fossils, would, not, be, accepted, by, all, naturalists, until, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, due, to, philosophical, and, theological, debate, about, issues, such, as, the, age, of, the, earth, and, extinction, up, through, the, 19th, century, the, scope, of, biology, was, largely, divided, between, medicine, which, investigated, questions, of, form, and, function, i, e, physiology, and, natural, history, which, was, concerned, with, the, diversity, of, life, and, interactions, among, different, forms, of, life, and, between, life, and, non, life, by, 1900, much, of, these, domains, overlapped, while, natural, history, and, its, counterpart, natural, philosophy, had, largely, given, way, to, more, specialized, scientific, disciplines, cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, geography, and, geology, the, term, biology, in, its, modern, sense, appears, to, have, been, introduced, independently, by, thomas, beddoes, in, 1799, karl, friedrich, burdach, in, 1800, gottfried, reinhold, treviranus, biologie, oder, philosophie, der, lebenden, natur, 1802, and, jean, baptiste, lamarck, hydrog, ologie, 1802, the, word, itself, appears, in, the, title, of, volume, 3, of, michael, christoph, hanow, s, philosophiae, naturalis, sive, physicae, dogmaticae, geologia, biologia, phytologia, generalis, et, dendrologia, published, in, 1766, the, term, biology, derives, from, the, greek, b, os, life, and, logia, branch, of, study, before, biology, there, were, several, terms, used, for, the, study, of, animals, and, plants, natural, history, referred, to, the, descriptive, aspects, of, biology, though, it, also, included, mineralogy, and, other, non, biological, fields, from, the, middle, ages, through, the, renaissance, the, unifying, framework, of, natural, history, was, the, scala, naturae, or, great, chain, of, being, natural, philosophy, and, natural, theology, encompassed, the, conceptual, and, metaphysical, basis, of, plant, and, animal, life, dealing, with, problems, of, why, organisms, exist, and, behave, the, way, they, do, though, these, subjects, also, included, what, is, now, geology, physics, chemistry, and, astronomy, physiology, and, botanical, pharmacology, were, the, province, of, medicine, botany, zoology, and, in, the, case, of, fossils, geology, replaced, natural, history, and, natural, philosophy, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, before, biology, was, widely, adopted, to, this, day, botany, and, zoology, are, widely, used, although, they, have, been, joined, by, other, sub, disciplines, of, biology, widespread, travel, by, naturalists, in, the, early, to, mid, 19th, century, resulted, in, a, wealth, of, new, information, about, the, diversity, and, distribution, of, living, organisms, of, particular, importance, was, the, work, of, alexander, von, humboldt, which, analyzed, the, relationship, between, organisms, and, their, environment, i, e, the, domain, of, natural, history, using, the, quantitative, approaches, of, natural, philosophy, i, e, physics, and, chemistry, humboldt, s, work, laid, the, foundations, of, biogeography, and, inspired, several, generations, of, scientists, the, emerging, discipline, of, geology, also, brought, natural, history, and, natural, philosophy, closer, together, the, establishment, of, the, stratigraphic, column, linked, the, spatial, distribution, of, organisms, to, their, temporal, distribution, a, key, precursor, to, concepts, of, evolution, georges, cuvier, and, others, made, great, strides, in, comparative, anatomy, and, paleontology, in, the, late, 1790s, and, early, 19th, century, in, a, series, of, lectures, and, papers, that, made, detailed, comparisons, between, living, mammals, and, fossil, remains, cuvier, was, able, to, establish, that, the, fossils, were, remains, of, species, that, had, become, extinct, rather, than, being, remains, of, species, still, alive, elsewhere, in, the, world, as, had, been, widely, believed, fossils, discovered, and, described, by, gideon, mantell, william, buckland, mary, anning, and, richard, owen, among, others, helped, establish, that, there, had, been, an, age, of, reptiles, that, had, preceded, even, the, prehistoric, mammals, these, discoveries, captured, the, public, imagination, and, focused, attention, on, the, history, of, life, on, earth, most, of, these, geologists, held, to, catastrophism, but, charles, lyell, s, influential, principles, of, geology, 1830, popularised, hutton, s, uniformitarianism, a, theory, that, explained, the, geological, past, and, present, on, equal, terms, the, most, significant, evolutionary, theory, before, darwin, s, was, that, of, jean, baptiste, lamarck, based, on, the, inheritance, of, acquired, characteristics, an, inheritance, mechanism, that, was, widely, accepted, until, the, 20th, century, it, described, a, chain, of, development, stretching, from, the, lowliest, microbe, to, humans, the, british, naturalist, charles, darwin, combining, the, biogeographical, approach, of, humboldt, the, uniformitarian, geology, of, lyell, thomas, malthus, s, writings, on, population, growth, and, his, own, morphological, expertise, created, a, more, successful, evolutionary, theory, based, on, natural, selection, similar, evidence, led, alfred, russel, wallace, to, independently, reach, the, same, conclusions, the, 1859, publication, of, darwin, s, theory, in, on, the, origin, of, species, by, means, of, natural, selection, or, the, preservation, of, favoured, races, in, the, struggle, for, life, is, often, considered, the, central, event, in, the, history, of, modern, biology, darwin, s, established, credibility, as, a, naturalist, the, sober, tone, of, the, work, and, most, of, all, the, sheer, strength, and, volume, of, evidence, presented, allowed, origin, to, succeed, where, previous, evolutionary, works, such, as, the, anonymous, vestiges, of, creation, had, failed, most, scientists, were, convinced, of, evolution, and, common, descent, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, however, natural, selection, would, not, be, accepted, as, the, primary, mechanism, of, evolution, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, as, most, contemporary, theories, of, heredity, seemed, incompatible, with, the, inheritance, of, random, variation, wallace, following, on, earlier, work, by, de, candolle, humboldt, and, darwin, made, major, contributions, to, zoogeography, because, of, his, interest, in, the, transmutation, hypothesis, he, paid, particular, attention, to, the, geographical, distribution, of, closely, allied, species, during, his, field, work, first, in, south, america, and, then, in, the, malay, archipelago, while, in, the, archipelago, he, identified, the, wallace, line, which, runs, through, the, spice, islands, dividing, the, fauna, of, the, archipelago, between, an, asian, zone, and, a, new, guinea, australian, zone, his, key, question, as, to, why, the, fauna, of, islands, with, such, similar, climates, should, be, so, different, could, only, be, answered, by, considering, their, origin, in, 1876, he, wrote, the, geographical, distribution, of, animals, which, was, the, standard, reference, work, for, over, half, a, century, and, a, sequel, island, life, in, 1880, that, focused, on, island, biogeography, he, extended, the, six, zone, system, developed, by, philip, sclater, for, describing, the, geographical, distribution, of, birds, to, animals, of, all, kinds, his, method, of, tabulating, data, on, animal, groups, in, geographic, zones, highlighted, the, discontinuities, and, his, appreciation, of, evolution, allowed, him, to, propose, rational, explanations, which, had, not, been, done, before, the, scientific, study, of, heredity, grew, rapidly, in, the, wake, of, darwin, s, origin, of, species, with, the, work, of, francis, galton, and, the, biometricians, the, origin, of, genetics, is, usually, traced, to, the, 1866, work, of, the, monk, gregor, mendel, who, would, later, be, credited, with, the, laws, of, inheritance, however, his, work, was, not, recognized, as, significant, until, 35, years, afterward, in, the, meantime, a, variety, of, theories, of, inheritance, based, on, pangenesis, orthogenesis, or, other, mechanisms, were, debated, and, investigated, vigorously, embryology, and, ecology, also, became, central, biological, fields, especially, as, linked, to, evolution, and, popularized, in, the, work, of, ernst, haeckel, most, of, the, 19th, century, work, on, heredity, however, was, not, in, the, realm, of, natural, history, but, that, of, experimental, physiology, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, the, scope, of, physiology, expanded, greatly, from, a, primarily, medically, oriented, field, to, a, wide, ranging, investigation, of, the, physical, and, chemical, processes, of, life, including, plants, animals, and, even, microorganisms, in, addition, to, man, living, things, as, machines, became, a, dominant, metaphor, in, biological, and, social, thinking, advances, in, microscopy, also, had, a, profound, impact, on, biological, thinking, in, the, early, 19th, century, a, number, of, biologists, pointed, to, the, central, importance, of, the, cell, in, 1838, and, 1839, schleiden, and, schwann, began, promoting, the, ideas, that, 1, the, basic, unit, of, organisms, is, the, cell, and, 2, that, individual, cells, have, all, the, characteristics, of, life, though, they, opposed, the, idea, that, 3, all, cells, come, from, the, division, of, other, cells, thanks, to, the, work, of, robert, remak, and, rudolf, virchow, however, by, the, 1860s, most, biologists, accepted, all, three, tenets, of, what, came, to, be, known, as, cell, theory, cell, theory, led, biologists, to, re, envision, individual, organisms, as, interdependent, assemblages, of, individual, cells, scientists, in, the, rising, field, of, cytology, armed, with, increasingly, powerful, microscopes, and, new, staining, methods, soon, found, that, even, single, cells, were, far, more, complex, than, the, homogeneous, fluid, filled, chambers, described, by, earlier, microscopists, robert, brown, had, described, the, nucleus, in, 1831, and, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, cytologists, identified, many, of, the, key, cell, components, chromosomes, centrosomes, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and, other, structures, made, visible, through, staining, between, 1874, and, 1884, walther, flemming, described, the, discrete, stages, of, mitosis, showing, that, they, were, not, artifacts, of, staining, but, occurred, in, living, cells, and, moreover, that, chromosomes, doubled, in, number, just, before, the, cell, divided, and, a, daughter, cell, was, produced, much, of, the, research, on, cell, reproduction, came, together, in, august, weismann, s, theory, of, heredity, he, identified, the, nucleus, in, particular, chromosomes, as, the, hereditary, material, proposed, the, distinction, between, somatic, cells, and, germ, cells, arguing, that, chromosome, number, must, be, halved, for, germ, cells, a, precursor, to, the, concept, of, meiosis, and, adopted, hugo, de, vries, s, theory, of, pangenes, weismannism, was, extremely, influential, especially, in, the, new, field, of, experimental, embryology, by, the, mid, 1850s, the, miasma, theory, of, disease, was, largely, superseded, by, the, germ, theory, of, disease, creating, extensive, interest, in, microorganisms, and, their, interactions, with, other, forms, of, life, by, the, 1880s, bacteriology, was, becoming, a, coherent, discipline, especially, through, the, work, of, robert, koch, who, introduced, methods, for, growing, pure, cultures, on, agar, gels, containing, specific, nutrients, in, petri, dishes, the, long, held, idea, that, living, organisms, could, easily, originate, from, nonliving, matter, spontaneous, generation, was, attacked, in, a, series, of, experiments, carried, out, by, louis, pasteur, while, debates, over, vitalism, vs, mechanism, a, perennial, issue, since, the, time, of, aristotle, and, the, greek, atomists, continued, apace, in, chemistry, one, central, issue, was, the, distinction, between, organic, and, inorganic, substances, especially, in, the, context, of, organic, transformations, such, as, fermentation, and, putrefaction, since, aristotle, these, had, been, considered, essentially, biological, vital, processes, however, friedrich, w, hler, justus, liebig, and, other, pioneers, of, the, rising, field, of, organic, chemistry, building, on, the, work, of, lavoisier, showed, that, the, organic, world, could, often, be, analyzed, by, physical, and, chemical, methods, in, 1828, w, hler, showed, that, the, organic, substance, urea, could, be, created, by, chemical, means, that, do, not, involve, life, providing, a, powerful, challenge, to, vitalism, cell, extracts, ferments, that, could, effect, chemical, transformations, were, discovered, beginning, with, diastase, in, 1833, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, concept, of, enzymes, was, well, established, though, equations, of, chemical, kinetics, would, not, be, applied, to, enzymatic, reactions, until, the, early, 20th, century, physiologists, such, as, claude, bernard, explored, through, vivisection, and, other, experimental, methods, the, chemical, and, physical, functions, of, living, bodies, to, an, unprecedented, degree, laying, the, groundwork, for, endocrinology, a, field, that, developed, quickly, after, the, discovery, of, the, first, hormone, secretin, in, 1902, biomechanics, and, the, study, of, nutrition, and, digestion, the, importance, and, diversity, of, experimental, physiology, methods, within, both, medicine, and, biology, grew, dramatically, over, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, control, and, manipulation, of, life, processes, became, a, central, concern, and, experiment, was, placed, at, the, center, of, biological, education, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, biological, research, was, largely, a, professional, endeavour, most, work, was, still, done, in, the, natural, history, mode, which, emphasized, morphological, and, phylogenetic, analysis, over, experiment, based, causal, explanations, however, anti, vitalist, experimental, physiologists, and, embryologists, especially, in, europe, were, increasingly, influential, the, tremendous, success, of, experimental, approaches, to, development, heredity, and, metabolism, in, the, 1900s, and, 1910s, demonstrated, the, power, of, experimentation, in, biology, in, the, following, decades, experimental, work, replaced, natural, history, as, the, dominant, mode, of, research, in, the, early, 20th, century, naturalists, were, faced, with, increasing, pressure, to, add, rigor, and, preferably, experimentation, to, their, methods, as, the, newly, prominent, laboratory, based, biological, disciplines, had, done, ecology, had, emerged, as, a, combination, of, biogeography, with, the, biogeochemical, cycle, concept, pioneered, by, chemists, field, biologists, developed, quantitative, methods, such, as, the, quadrat, and, adapted, laboratory, instruments, and, cameras, for, the, field, to, further, set, their, work, apart, from, traditional, natural, history, zoologists, and, botanists, did, what, they, could, to, mitigate, the, unpredictability, of, the, living, world, performing, laboratory, experiments, and, studying, semi, controlled, natural, environments, such, as, gardens, new, institutions, like, the, carnegie, station, for, experimental, evolution, and, the, marine, biological, laboratory, provided, more, controlled, environments, for, studying, organisms, through, their, entire, life, cycles, the, ecological, succession, concept, pioneered, in, the, 1900s, and, 1910s, by, henry, chandler, cowles, and, frederic, clements, was, important, in, early, plant, ecology, alfred, lotka, s, predator, prey, equations, g, evelyn, hutchinson, s, studies, of, the, biogeography, and, biogeochemical, structure, of, lakes, and, rivers, limnology, and, charles, elton, s, studies, of, animal, food, chains, were, pioneers, among, the, succession, of, quantitative, methods, that, colonized, the, developing, ecological, specialties, ecology, became, an, independent, discipline, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, after, eugene, p, odum, synthesized, many, of, the, concepts, of, ecosystem, ecology, placing, relationships, between, groups, of, organisms, especially, material, and, energy, relationships, at, the, center, of, the, field, in, the, 1960s, as, evolutionary, theorists, explored, the, possibility, of, multiple, units, of, selection, ecologists, turned, to, evolutionary, approaches, in, population, ecology, debate, over, group, selection, was, brief, but, vigorous, by, 1970, most, biologists, agreed, that, natural, selection, was, rarely, effective, above, the, level, of, individual, organisms, the, evolution, of, ecosystems, however, became, a, lasting, research, focus, ecology, expanded, rapidly, with, the, rise, of, the, environmental, movement, the, international, biological, program, attempted, to, apply, the, methods, of, big, science, which, had, been, so, successful, in, the, physical, sciences, to, ecosystem, ecology, and, pressing, environmental, issues, while, smaller, scale, independent, efforts, such, as, island, biogeography, and, the, hubbard, brook, experimental, forest, helped, redefine, the, scope, of, an, increasingly, diverse, discipline, 1900, marked, the, so, called, rediscovery, of, mendel, by, carl, correns, who, arrived, at, mendel, s, laws, which, were, not, actually, present, in, mendel, s, work, soon, after, cytologists, cell, biologists, proposed, that, chromosomes, were, the, hereditary, material, this, was, taken, up, by, carl, correns, and, others, between, 1910, and, 1915, as, the, mendelian, chromosome, theory, of, heredity, thomas, hunt, morgan, and, the, drosophilists, in, his, fly, lab, applied, this, to, a, new, model, organism, they, hypothesized, crossing, over, to, explain, linkage, and, constructed, genetic, maps, of, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, which, became, a, widely, used, model, organism, hugo, de, vries, tried, to, link, the, new, genetics, with, evolution, building, on, his, work, with, heredity, and, hybridization, he, proposed, a, theory, of, mutationism, which, was, widely, accepted, in, the, early, 20th, century, lamarckism, or, the, theory, of, inheritance, of, acquired, characteristics, also, had, many, adherents, darwinism, was, seen, as, incompatible, with, the, continuously, variable, traits, studied, by, biometricians, which, seemed, only, partially, heritable, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, following, the, acceptance, of, the, mendelian, chromosome, theory, the, emergence, of, the, discipline, of, population, genetics, with, the, work, of, r, a, fisher, j, b, s, haldane, and, sewall, wright, unified, the, idea, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, with, mendelian, genetics, producing, the, modern, synthesis, the, inheritance, of, acquired, characters, was, rejected, while, mutationism, gave, way, as, genetic, theories, matured, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, the, ideas, of, population, genetics, began, to, be, applied, in, the, new, discipline, of, the, genetics, of, behavior, sociobiology, and, especially, in, humans, evolutionary, psychology, in, the, 1960s, w, d, hamilton, and, others, developed, game, theory, approaches, to, explain, altruism, from, an, evolutionary, perspective, through, kin, selection, the, possible, origin, of, higher, organisms, through, endosymbiosis, and, contrasting, approaches, to, molecular, evolution, in, the, gene, centered, view, which, held, selection, as, the, predominant, cause, of, evolution, and, the, neutral, theory, which, made, genetic, drift, a, key, factor, spawned, perennial, debates, over, the, proper, balance, of, adaptationism, and, contingency, in, evolutionary, theory, in, the, 1970s, stephen, jay, gould, and, niles, eldredge, proposed, the, theory, of, punctuated, equilibrium, which, holds, that, stasis, is, the, most, prominent, feature, of, the, fossil, record, and, that, most, evolutionary, changes, occur, rapidly, over, relatively, short, periods, of, time, in, 1980, luis, alvarez, and, walter, alvarez, proposed, the, hypothesis, that, an, impact, event, was, responsible, for, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, also, in, the, early, 1980s, statistical, analysis, of, the, fossil, record, of, marine, organisms, published, by, jack, sepkoski, and, david, m, raup, led, to, a, better, appreciation, of, the, importance, of, mass, extinction, events, to, the, history, of, life, on, earth, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, all, of, the, major, pathways, of, drug, metabolism, had, been, discovered, along, with, the, outlines, of, protein, and, fatty, acid, metabolism, and, urea, synthesis, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, the, minor, components, of, foods, in, human, nutrition, the, vitamins, began, to, be, isolated, and, synthesized, improved, laboratory, techniques, such, as, chromatography, and, electrophoresis, led, to, rapid, advances, in, physiological, chemistry, which, as, biochemistry, began, to, achieve, independence, from, its, medical, origins, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, biochemists, led, by, hans, krebs, and, carl, and, gerty, cori, began, to, work, out, many, of, the, central, metabolic, pathways, of, life, the, citric, acid, cycle, glycogenesis, and, glycolysis, and, the, synthesis, of, steroids, and, porphyrins, between, the, 1930s, and, 1950s, fritz, lipmann, and, others, established, the, role, of, atp, as, the, universal, carrier, of, energy, in, the, cell, and, mitochondria, as, the, powerhouse, of, the, cell, such, traditionally, biochemical, work, continued, to, be, very, actively, pursued, throughout, the, 20th, century, and, into, the, 21st, following, the, rise, of, classical, genetics, many, biologists, including, a, new, wave, of, physical, scientists, in, biology, pursued, the, question, of, the, gene, and, its, physical, nature, warren, weaver, head, of, the, science, division, of, the, rockefeller, foundation, issued, grants, to, promote, research, that, applied, the, methods, of, physics, and, chemistry, to, basic, biological, problems, coining, the, term, molecular, biology, for, this, approach, in, 1938, many, of, the, significant, biological, breakthroughs, of, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, were, funded, by, the, rockefeller, foundation, like, biochemistry, the, overlapping, disciplines, of, bacteriology, and, virology, later, combined, as, microbiology, situated, between, science, and, medicine, developed, rapidly, in, the, early, 20th, century, f, lix, d, herelle, s, isolation, of, bacteriophage, during, world, war, i, initiated, a, long, line, of, research, focused, on, phage, viruses, and, the, bacteria, they, infect, the, development, of, standard, genetically, uniform, organisms, that, could, produce, repeatable, experimental, results, was, essential, for, the, development, of, molecular, genetics, after, early, work, with, drosophila, and, maize, the, adoption, of, simpler, model, systems, like, the, bread, mold, neurospora, crassa, made, it, possible, to, connect, genetics, to, biochemistry, most, importantly, with, beadle, and, tatum, s, one, gene, one, enzyme, hypothesis, in, 1941, genetics, experiments, on, even, simpler, systems, like, tobacco, mosaic, virus, and, bacteriophage, aided, by, the, new, technologies, of, electron, microscopy, and, ultracentrifugation, forced, scientists, to, re, evaluate, the, literal, meaning, of, life, virus, heredity, and, reproducing, nucleoprotein, cell, structures, outside, the, nucleus, plasmagenes, complicated, the, accepted, mendelian, chromosome, theory, oswald, avery, showed, in, 1943, that, dna, was, likely, the, genetic, material, of, the, chromosome, not, its, protein, the, issue, was, settled, decisively, with, the, 1952, hershey, chase, experiment, one, of, many, contributions, from, the, so, called, phage, group, centered, around, physicist, turned, biologist, max, delbr, ck, in, 1953, james, watson, and, francis, crick, building, on, the, work, of, maurice, wilkins, and, rosalind, franklin, suggested, that, the, structure, of, dna, was, a, double, helix, in, their, famous, paper, molecular, structure, of, nucleic, acids, watson, and, crick, noted, coyly, it, has, not, escaped, our, notice, that, the, specific, pairing, we, have, postulated, immediately, suggests, a, possible, copying, mechanism, for, the, genetic, material, after, the, 1958, meselson, stahl, experiment, confirmed, the, semiconservative, replication, of, dna, it, was, clear, to, most, biologists, that, nucleic, acid, sequence, must, somehow, determine, amino, acid, sequence, in, proteins, physicist, george, gamow, proposed, that, a, fixed, genetic, code, connected, proteins, and, dna, between, 1953, and, 1961, there, were, few, known, biological, sequences, either, dna, or, protein, but, an, abundance, of, proposed, code, systems, a, situation, made, even, more, complicated, by, expanding, knowledge, of, the, intermediate, role, of, rna, in, 1961, it, was, demonstrated, that, when, a, gene, encodes, a, protein, three, sequential, bases, of, a, gene, s, dna, specify, each, successive, amino, acid, of, the, protein, thus, the, genetic, code, is, a, triplet, code, where, each, triplet, called, a, codon, specifies, a, particular, amino, acid, furthermore, it, was, shown, that, the, codons, do, not, overlap, with, each, other, in, the, dna, sequence, encoding, a, protein, and, that, each, sequence, is, read, from, a, fixed, starting, point, to, actually, decipher, the, code, it, took, an, extensive, series, of, experiments, in, biochemistry, and, bacterial, genetics, between, 1961, and, 1966, most, importantly, the, work, of, nirenberg, and, khorana, during, 1962, 1964, numerous, conditional, lethal, mutants, of, a, bacterial, virus, were, isolated, these, mutants, were, used, in, several, different, labs, to, advance, fundamental, understanding, of, the, functions, and, interactions, of, the, proteins, employed, in, the, machinery, of, dna, replication, dna, repair, dna, recombination, and, in, the, assembly, of, molecular, structures, in, addition, to, the, division, of, biology, at, caltech, the, laboratory, of, molecular, biology, and, its, precursors, at, cambridge, and, a, handful, of, other, institutions, the, pasteur, institute, became, a, major, center, for, molecular, biology, research, in, the, late, 1950s, scientists, at, cambridge, led, by, max, perutz, and, john, kendrew, focused, on, the, rapidly, developing, field, of, structural, biology, combining, x, ray, crystallography, with, molecular, modelling, and, the, new, computational, possibilities, of, digital, computing, benefiting, both, directly, and, indirectly, from, the, military, funding, of, science, a, number, of, biochemists, led, by, frederick, sanger, later, joined, the, cambridge, lab, bringing, together, the, study, of, macromolecular, structure, and, function, at, the, pasteur, institute, fran, ois, jacob, and, jacques, monod, followed, the, 1959, pajamo, experiment, with, a, series, of, publications, regarding, the, lac, operon, that, established, the, concept, of, gene, regulation, and, identified, what, came, to, be, known, as, messenger, rna, by, the, mid, 1960s, the, intellectual, core, of, molecular, biology, a, model, for, the, molecular, basis, of, metabolism, and, reproduction, was, largely, complete, the, late, 1950s, to, the, early, 1970s, was, a, period, of, intense, research, and, institutional, expansion, for, molecular, biology, which, had, only, recently, become, a, somewhat, coherent, discipline, in, what, organismic, biologist, e, o, wilson, called, the, molecular, wars, the, methods, and, practitioners, of, molecular, biology, spread, rapidly, often, coming, to, dominate, departments, and, even, entire, disciplines, molecularization, was, particularly, important, in, genetics, immunology, embryology, and, neurobiology, while, the, idea, that, life, is, controlled, by, a, genetic, program, a, metaphor, jacob, and, monod, introduced, from, the, emerging, fields, of, cybernetics, and, computer, science, became, an, influential, perspective, throughout, biology, immunology, in, particular, became, linked, with, molecular, biology, with, innovation, flowing, both, ways, the, clonal, selection, theory, developed, by, niels, jerne, and, frank, macfarlane, burnet, in, the, mid, 1950s, helped, shed, light, on, the, general, mechanisms, of, protein, synthesis, resistance, to, the, growing, influence, of, molecular, biology, was, especially, evident, in, evolutionary, biology, protein, sequencing, had, great, potential, for, the, quantitative, study, of, evolution, through, the, molecular, clock, hypothesis, but, leading, evolutionary, biologists, questioned, the, relevance, of, molecular, biology, for, answering, the, big, questions, of, evolutionary, causation, departments, and, disciplines, fractured, as, organismic, biologists, asserted, their, importance, and, independence, theodosius, dobzhansky, made, the, famous, statement, that, nothing, in, biology, makes, sense, except, in, the, light, of, evolution, as, a, response, to, the, molecular, challenge, the, issue, became, even, more, critical, after, 1968, motoo, kimura, s, neutral, theory, of, molecular, evolution, suggested, that, natural, selection, was, not, the, ubiquitous, cause, of, evolution, at, least, at, the, molecular, level, and, that, molecular, evolution, might, be, a, fundamentally, different, process, from, morphological, evolution, resolving, this, molecular, morphological, paradox, has, been, a, central, focus, of, molecular, evolution, research, since, the, 1960s, biotechnology, in, the, general, sense, has, been, an, important, part, of, biology, since, the, late, 19th, century, with, the, industrialization, of, brewing, and, agriculture, chemists, and, biologists, became, aware, of, the, great, potential, of, human, controlled, biological, processes, in, particular, fermentation, proved, a, great, boon, to, chemical, industries, by, the, early, 1970s, a, wide, range, of, biotechnologies, were, being, developed, from, drugs, like, penicillin, and, steroids, to, foods, like, chlorella, and, single, cell, protein, to, gasohol, as, well, as, a, wide, range, of, hybrid, high, yield, crops, and, agricultural, technologies, the, basis, for, the, green, revolution, biotechnology, in, the, modern, sense, of, genetic, engineering, began, in, the, 1970s, with, the, invention, of, recombinant, dna, techniques, restriction, enzymes, were, discovered, and, characterized, in, the, late, 1960s, following, on, the, heels, of, the, isolation, then, duplication, then, synthesis, of, viral, genes, beginning, with, the, lab, of, paul, berg, in, 1972, aided, by, ecori, from, herbert, boyer, s, lab, building, on, work, with, ligase, by, arthur, kornberg, s, lab, molecular, biologists, put, these, pieces, together, to, produce, the, first, transgenic, organisms, soon, after, others, began, using, plasmid, vectors, and, adding, genes, for, antibiotic, resistance, greatly, increasing, the, reach, of, the, recombinant, techniques, wary, of, the, potential, dangers, particularly, the, possibility, of, a, prolific, bacteria, with, a, viral, cancer, causing, gene, the, scientific, community, as, well, as, a, wide, range, of, scientific, outsiders, reacted, to, these, developments, with, both, enthusiasm, and, fearful, restraint, prominent, molecular, biologists, led, by, berg, suggested, a, temporary, moratorium, on, recombinant, dna, research, until, the, dangers, could, be, assessed, and, policies, could, be, created, this, moratorium, was, largely, respected, until, the, participants, in, the, 1975, asilomar, conference, on, recombinant, dna, created, policy, recommendations, and, concluded, that, the, technology, could, be, used, safely, following, asilomar, new, genetic, engineering, techniques, and, applications, developed, rapidly, dna, sequencing, methods, improved, greatly, pioneered, by, frederick, sanger, and, walter, gilbert, as, did, oligonucleotide, synthesis, and, transfection, techniques, researchers, learned, to, control, the, expression, of, transgenes, and, were, soon, racing, in, both, academic, and, industrial, contexts, to, create, organisms, capable, of, expressing, human, genes, for, the, production, of, human, hormones, however, this, was, a, more, daunting, task, than, molecular, biologists, had, expected, developments, between, 1977, and, 1980, showed, that, due, to, the, phenomena, of, split, genes, and, splicing, higher, organisms, had, a, much, more, complex, system, of, gene, expression, than, the, bacteria, models, of, earlier, studies, the, first, such, race, for, synthesizing, human, insulin, was, won, by, genentech, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, biotech, boom, and, with, it, the, era, of, gene, patents, with, an, unprecedented, level, of, overlap, between, biology, industry, and, law, by, the, 1980s, protein, sequencing, had, already, transformed, methods, of, scientific, classification, of, organisms, especially, cladistics, but, biologists, soon, began, to, use, rna, and, dna, sequences, as, characters, this, expanded, the, significance, of, molecular, evolution, within, evolutionary, biology, as, the, results, of, molecular, systematics, could, be, compared, with, traditional, evolutionary, trees, based, on, morphology, following, the, pioneering, ideas, of, lynn, margulis, on, endosymbiotic, theory, which, holds, that, some, of, the, organelles, of, eukaryotic, cells, originated, from, free, living, prokaryotic, organisms, through, symbiotic, relationships, even, the, overall, division, of, the, tree, of, life, was, revised, into, the, 1990s, the, five, domains, plants, animals, fungi, protists, and, monerans, became, three, the, archaea, the, bacteria, and, the, eukarya, based, on, carl, woese, s, pioneering, molecular, systematics, work, with, 16s, rrna, sequencing, the, development, and, popularization, of, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, in, mid, 1980s, by, kary, mullis, and, others, at, cetus, corp, marked, another, watershed, in, the, history, of, modern, biotechnology, greatly, increasing, the, ease, and, speed, of, genetic, analysis, coupled, with, the, use, of, expressed, sequence, tags, pcr, led, to, the, discovery, of, many, more, genes, than, could, be, found, through, traditional, biochemical, or, genetic, methods, and, opened, the, possibility, of, sequencing, entire, genomes, the, unity, of, much, of, the, morphogenesis, of, organisms, from, fertilized, egg, to, adult, began, to, be, unraveled, after, the, discovery, of, the, homeobox, genes, first, in, fruit, flies, then, in, other, insects, and, animals, including, humans, these, developments, led, to, advances, in, the, field, of, evolutionary, developmental, biology, towards, understanding, how, the, various, body, plans, of, the, animal, phyla, have, evolved, and, how, they, are, related, to, one, another, the, human, genome, project, the, largest, most, costly, single, biological, study, ever, undertaken, began, in, 1988, under, the, leadership, of, james, d, watson, after, preliminary, work, with, genetically, simpler, model, organisms, such, as, e, coli, s, cerevisiae, and, c, elegans, shotgun, sequencing, and, gene, discovery, methods, pioneered, by, craig, venter, and, fueled, by, the, financial, promise, of, gene, patents, with, celera, genomics, led, to, a, public, private, sequencing, competition, that, ended, in, compromise, with, the, first, draft, of, the, human, dna, sequence, announced, in, 2000, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, biological, sciences, converged, with, previously, differentiated, new, and, classic, disciplines, like, physics, into, research, fields, like, biophysics, advances, were, made, in, analytical, chemistry, and, physics, instrumentation, including, improved, sensors, optics, tracers, instrumentation, signal, processing, networks, robots, satellites, and, compute, power, for, data, collection, storage, analysis, modeling, visualization, and, simulations, these, technological, advances, allowed, theoretical, and, experimental, research, including, internet, publication, of, molecular, biochemistry, biological, systems, and, ecosystems, science, this, enabled, worldwide, access, to, better, measurements, theoretical, models, complex, simulations, theory, predictive, model, experimentation, analysis, worldwide, internet, observational, data, reporting, open, peer, review, collaboration, and, internet, publication, new, fields, of, biological, sciences, research, emerged, including, bioinformatics, neuroscience, theoretical, biology, computational, genomics, astrobiology, and, synthetic, biology, as, far, as, biology, as, a, whole, is, concerned, it, was, not, until, the, late, eighteenth, and, early, nineteenth, century, that, the, universities, became, centers, of, biological, research
