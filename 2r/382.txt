korean, peninsula, and, china, proper, which, were, ruled, by, the, joseon, and, ming, dynasties, respectively, japan, quickly, succeeded, in, occupying, large, portions, of, the, korean, peninsula, but, the, contribution, of, reinforcements, by, the, ming, as, well, as, the, disruption, of, japanese, supply, fleets, along, the, western, and, southern, coasts, by, the, joseon, navy, forced, the,

japan, renewed, its, offensive, by, invading, korea, a, second, time, the, pattern, of, the, second, invasion, largely, mirrored, that, of, the, first, the, japanese, had, initial, successes, on,

relations, in, korean, the, first, invasion, 1592, 1593, is, called, the, japanese, disturbance, of, imjin, where, 1592, is, an, imjin, year, in, the, sexagenary, cycle, the, second, invasion, 1597, 1598, is, called, the, second, war, of, jeong, yu, collectively, the, invasions, are, referred, to, as, the, imjin, war, in, chinese, the, wars, are, referred, to, as, the, wanli, korean, campaign, after, the, reigning, chinese, emperor, in, japanese, the, war, is, called, bunroku, no, eki, bunroku, referring, to, the, japanese, era, name, spanning, the, period, from, 1592, to, 1596, the, second, invasion, 1597, 1598, is, called, keich, no, eki, during, the, edo, period, 17, 19th, centuries, the, war, was, also, called, kara, iri, entry, into, china, or, more, accurately, entry, into, tang, the, dynasty, whose, name, is, synonymous, with, china, japan, s, ultimate, purpose, was, the, invasion, of, ming, china, however, during, the, war, as, the, reality, that, the, conflict, was, largely, confined, to, the, korean, peninsula, seeped, in, toyotomi, hideyoshi, would, soon, alter, his, original, objectives, in, 1592, with, an, army, of, approximately, 158, 000, soldiers, toyotomi, hideyoshi, launched, what, would, end, up, being, the, first, of, two, invasions, of, korea, with, the, intent, of, conquering, joseon, korea, and, eventually, ming, china, initially, the, japanese, forces, saw, overwhelming, success, on, land, capturing, both, hanseong, the, capital, of, korea, and, pyongyang, and, completing, the, occupation, of, large, portions, of, the, korean, peninsula, in, three, months, the, japanese, forces, well, trained, confident, and, experienced, after, the, numerous, battles, and, conflicts, of, the, sengoku, period, typically, held, the, field, in, most, land, engagements, this, success, on, land, however, was, constrained, by, the, naval, campaigns, of, the, korean, navy, which, would, continue, to, raid, japanese, supply, fleets, in, its, coastal, waters, hampering, the, japanese, advances, as, supply, lines, were, disrupted, along, the, western, korean, coast, and, japanese, naval, reinforcements, were, repelled, these, trends, with, some, exceptions, on, both, sides, held, true, throughout, much, of, the, conflict, under, the, rule, of, the, wanli, emperor, ming, china, quickly, interpreted, the, japanese, invasions, as, a, challenge, and, threat, to, the, imperial, chinese, tributary, system, the, ming, s, interest, was, also, to, keep, the, war, confined, to, the, korean, peninsula, and, out, of, its, own, territory, they, entered, into, the, conflict, by, dispatching, reinforcements, to, attack, from, the, north, in, the, engagements, that, followed, the, majority, of, the, joseon, army, was, focused, on, defending, the, northern, provinces, from, japanese, offensives, while, also, supporting, ming, army, campaigns, to, recapture, territory, occupied, by, the, japanese, consequently, it, was, the, combination, of, these, ming, led, land, campaigns, and, joseon, led, naval, warfare, that, eventually, forced, the, japanese, army, to, withdraw, from, pyongyang, to, the, south, where, the, japanese, continued, to, occupy, hanseong, and, the, southern, regions, with, the, exception, of, the, southwestern, jeolla, province, the, pursuing, ming, and, joseon, armies, attempted, to, advance, further, into, the, south, but, were, halted, by, the, japanese, army, at, the, battle, of, byeokjegwan, subsequently, the, japanese, armies, launched, a, counterattack, in, an, attempt, to, reoccupy, the, northern, provinces, but, were, repelled, by, the, defending, joseon, army, at, haengju, fortress, additionally, joseon, s, civilian, led, armies, actively, waged, guerrilla, warfare, against, the, japanese, forces, in, the, south, which, weakened, the, japanese, hold, in, the, cities, they, occupied, afterwards, with, supply, difficulties, hampering, both, sides, neither, the, japanese, nor, the, combined, ming, and, joseon, forces, were, able, to, mount, a, successful, offensive, or, gain, any, additional, territory, resulting, in, a, military, stalemate, in, the, areas, between, hanseong, and, kaesong, the, war, continued, in, this, manner, for, five, years, and, was, followed, by, a, brief, interlude, between, 1596, and, 1597, during, which, japan, and, the, ming, engaged, in, ultimately, unsuccessful, peace, talks, in, 1597, japan, renewed, its, offensive, by, invading, korea, a, second, time, the, pattern, of, the, second, invasion, largely, mirrored, that, of, the, first, the, japanese, had, initial, successes, on, land, but, the, contribution, of, the, ming, forces, as, well, as, the, joseon, navy, s, disruption, of, japanese, supply, fleets, resulted, in, a, withdrawal, of, japanese, forces, towards, the, coastal, regions, of, the, peninsula, the, pursuing, ming, and, joseon, forces, however, failed, to, dislodge, the, japanese, from, their, fortresses, and, entrenched, positions, in, the, southern, coastal, areas, where, both, sides, became, locked, in, a, ten, month, long, military, stalemate, with, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, death, in, september, 1598, limited, progress, on, land, and, continued, disruption, of, supply, lines, along, the, western, and, southern, coasts, by, the, joseon, navy, the, remaining, japanese, forces, in, korea, were, ordered, to, withdraw, back, to, japan, by, the, new, governing, council, of, five, elders, final, peace, negotiations, between, the, parties, followed, afterwards, and, continued, for, several, years, ultimately, resulting, in, the, normalization, of, relations, in, 1392, general, yi, seonggye, led, a, successful, coup, to, take, political, power, in, korea, from, u, of, goryeo, seonggye, s, followers, forced, him, to, take, the, crown, as, taejo, of, joseon, thus, establishing, a, new, dynasty, in, search, of, a, justification, for, its, rule, given, the, lack, of, a, royal, bloodline, the, new, regime, received, recognition, from, china, and, integration, into, the, imperial, chinese, tributary, system, within, the, context, of, the, mandate, of, heaven, within, this, tributary, system, china, assumed, the, role, of, a, big, brother, with, korea, maintaining, the, highest, position, among, the, tributary, states, which, also, included, countries, such, as, the, ryukyu, kingdom, lan, xang, i, vi, t, and, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, in, return, for, accepting, the, subservient, tributary, role, of, a, younger, brother, in, 1402, the, japanese, shogun, ashikaga, yoshimitsu, despite, not, being, the, emperor, of, japan, was, conferred, the, title, of, king, of, japan, by, the, chinese, emperor, and, through, this, title, had, similarly, accepted, a, position, in, the, imperial, tributary, system, as, of, 1404, this, relationship, ended, in, 1408, when, japan, unlike, korea, chose, to, end, its, recognition, of, china, s, regional, hegemony, and, cancel, any, further, tribute, missions, membership, in, the, tributary, system, was, a, prerequisite, for, any, economic, exchange, with, china, in, exiting, the, system, japan, relinquished, its, trade, relationship, with, china, one, thousand, years, earlier, the, sui, and, tang, dynasties, of, china, had, complicated, political, and, trading, relations, with, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, ming, china, on, the, other, hand, had, close, trading, and, diplomatic, relations, with, the, joseon, which, remained, integrated, in, the, imperial, tributary, system, but, also, received, tribute, and, trade, from, s, clan, of, tsushima, japan, ming, china, and, joseon, korea, shared, much, in, common, both, emerged, during, the, 14th, century, after, the, end, of, the, yuan, dynasty, embraced, confucian, ideals, in, society, and, faced, similar, threats, jurchen, raiders, and, wokou, both, had, competing, internal, political, factions, which, would, influence, decisions, made, prior, to, and, during, the, war, because, of, close, trade, and, common, enemies, joseon, and, ming, had, a, friendly, alliance, by, the, last, decade, of, the, 16th, century, toyotomi, hideyoshi, the, most, preeminent, daimy, had, unified, all, of, japan, in, a, brief, period, of, peace, since, he, came, to, hold, power, in, the, absence, of, a, legitimate, successor, of, the, minamoto, lineage, necessary, for, the, imperial, sh, gun, commission, he, sought, military, power, to, legitimize, his, rule, and, to, decrease, his, dependence, on, the, imperial, family, it, is, also, suggested, that, hideyoshi, planned, an, invasion, of, china, to, fulfill, the, dreams, of, his, late, lord, oda, nobunaga, and, to, mitigate, the, possible, threat, of, civil, disorder, or, rebellion, posed, by, the, large, number, of, now, idle, samurai, and, soldiers, in, unified, japan, it, is, also, possible, that, hideyoshi, might, have, set, a, more, realistic, goal, of, subjugating, the, smaller, neighbouring, states, the, ryukyu, islands, taiwan, and, korea, and, treating, the, larger, or, more, distant, countries, as, trading, partners, because, throughout, the, invasion, of, korea, hideyoshi, sought, for, legal, tally, trade, with, china, hideyoshi, s, need, for, military, supremacy, as, a, justification, for, his, rule, which, lacked, sh, gunal, background, could, have, on, an, international, level, been, eventually, transformed, into, an, order, with, japan, s, neighboring, countries, below, japan, hideyoshi, did, not, take, the, title, of, sh, gun, on, the, grounds, that, he, lacked, the, necessary, minamoto, descent, but, since, it, was, very, common, in, 16th, century, japan, for, genealogists, to, discover, that, someone, had, illustrious, ancestry, for, the, right, price, that, suggests, that, hideyoshi, was, planning, on, creating, a, new, office, for, himself, to, replace, the, bakufu, hideyoshi, was, also, tempted, by, an, external, conflict, to, prevent, internal, rebellion, within, japan, which, would, keep, his, newly, formed, state, united, against, a, common, enemy, and, prevent, the, daimy, s, from, acting, on, any, ambitions, against, his, rule, fighting, a, war, away, from, japanese, territory, would, also, prevent, territorial, destruction, and, maintain, the, infrastructure, of, the, state, such, considerations, would, be, consistent, with, the, fact, that, hideyoshi, was, not, sh, gun, and, had, no, links, with, the, imperial, bloodline, stephen, turnbull, also, suggests, personal, ambition, and, megalomania, of, hideyoshi, as, reasons, for, the, invasion, hideyoshi, had, in, a, series, of, wars, conquered, japan, and, now, wanted, to, turn, to, bigger, things, noting, that, he, spoke, not, only, of, his, desire, to, slash, his, way, into, korea, to, invade, china, but, also, the, philippines, and, india, furthermore, for, thousands, of, years, china, had, been, the, intellectual, economic, military, and, political, center, of, east, asia, and, traditionally, the, states, of, east, asia, had, acknowledged, the, emperors, of, china, as, their, overlords, and, paid, tribute, in, exchange, for, being, allowed, to, trade, with, china, japan, had, usually, resisted, the, demand, to, pay, tribute, to, china, but, sh, gun, ashikaga, yoshimitsu, had, acknowledged, the, emperor, of, china, as, his, overlord, in, return, for, access, to, the, huge, chinese, market, japan, s, right, to, pay, tribute, and, with, it, the, right, to, trade, with, china, was, ended, in, the, 1540s, by, the, ming, court, in, response, to, raids, by, sino, japanese, pirates, known, as, the, wak, by, seeking, to, invade, china, hideyoshi, was, in, effect, claiming, for, japan, the, role, traditionally, played, by, china, in, east, asia, as, the, center, of, the, east, asian, international, order, he, rallied, support, in, japan, as, a, man, of, relatively, humble, origins, who, owed, his, position, to, his, military, might, finally, during, the, 1540s, 1550s, the, wak, had, staged, a, series, of, samurai, raids, into, korea, some, of, which, were, so, large, as, to, be, mini, invasions, hideyoshi, mistakenly, thought, his, enemies, were, weak, hideyoshi, planned, for, a, possible, war, with, korea, long, before, he, had, completed, the, unification, of, japan, he, made, preparations, on, many, fronts, as, early, as, 1578, hideyoshi, then, fighting, under, oda, nobunaga, against, m, ri, terumoto, for, control, of, the, ch, goku, region, informed, terumoto, of, nobunaga, s, plan, to, invade, china, in, 1585, hideyoshi, told, the, portuguese, jesuit, father, gaspar, coelho, of, his, wish, to, conquer, all, of, east, asia, hideyoshi, asked, coelho, to, send, a, message, to, his, master, king, philip, ii, of, spain, who, was, also, king, philip, i, of, portugal, asking, that, he, make, his, navy, available, to, help, japan, ming, china, spain, and, portugal, were, the, main, naval, powers, of, the, time, however, philip, refused, hideyoshi, preferring, not, to, upset, china, the, defeat, of, the, odawara, based, h, j, clan, in, 1590, finally, brought, about, the, second, unification, of, japan, and, hideyoshi, began, preparing, for, the, next, war, beginning, in, march, 1591, the, ky, sh, daimy, s, and, their, labor, forces, constructed, nagoya, castle, in, nagoya, saga, modern, day, karatsu, saga, not, to, be, confused, with, present, day, nagoya, city, in, aichi, prefecture, as, the, center, for, the, mobilization, of, the, invasion, forces, in, 1592, hideyoshi, sent, a, letter, to, the, philippines, demanding, tribute, from, the, spanish, governor, general, and, stating, that, japan, had, already, received, tribute, from, korea, which, was, a, misunderstanding, and, the, ryukyus, as, for, the, military, preparations, the, construction, of, as, many, as, 2, 000, ships, may, have, begun, as, early, as, 1586, to, estimate, the, strength, of, the, korean, military, hideyoshi, sent, an, assault, force, of, 26, ships, to, the, southern, coast, of, korea, in, 1587, on, the, diplomatic, front, hideyoshi, began, to, establish, friendly, relations, with, china, long, before, he, had, completed, the, unification, of, japan, he, also, helped, to, police, the, trade, routes, against, the, wokou, in, 1587, hideyoshi, sent, his, first, envoy, yutani, yasuhiro, to, korea, which, was, during, the, rule, of, king, seonjo, to, re, establish, diplomatic, relations, between, korea, and, japan, broken, since, the, wokou, raid, in, 1555, hideyoshi, hoped, to, use, this, as, a, foundation, to, induce, the, korean, court, to, join, japan, in, a, war, against, china, yasuhiro, with, his, warrior, background, and, an, attitude, disdainful, of, the, korean, officials, and, their, customs, failed, to, receive, the, promise, of, future, ambassadorial, missions, from, korea, around, may, 1589, hideyoshi, s, second, embassy, consisting, of, s, yoshitoshi, yanagawa, shigenobu, and, buddhist, monk, genso, reached, korea, and, secured, the, promise, of, a, korean, embassy, to, japan, in, exchange, for, a, group, of, korean, rebels, which, had, taken, refuge, in, japan, in, 1587, hideyoshi, had, ordered, the, adopted, father, of, yoshitoshi, and, the, daimy, of, tsushima, island, s, yoshishige, to, offer, the, joseon, dynasty, an, ultimatum, of, submitting, to, japan, and, participating, in, the, conquest, of, china, or, facing, the, prospect, of, open, war, with, japan, however, as, tsushima, island, enjoyed, a, special, trading, position, as, the, single, checkpoint, to, korea, for, all, japanese, ships, and, had, permission, from, korea, to, trade, with, as, many, as, 50, of, its, own, vessels, the, s, family, had, a, vested, interest, in, preventing, conflict, with, korea, and, delayed, the, talks, for, nearly, two, years, even, when, hideyoshi, renewed, his, order, s, yoshitoshi, reduced, the, visit, to, the, korean, court, to, a, campaign, to, better, relations, between, the, two, countries, near, the, end, of, the, ambassadorial, mission, yoshitoshi, presented, king, seonjo, a, brace, of, peafowl, and, matchlock, guns, the, first, advanced, firearms, to, come, to, korea, ryu, seong, ryong, a, high, ranking, scholar, official, suggested, that, the, military, put, the, arquebus, a, matchlock, firearm, into, production, and, use, but, the, korean, court, failed, to, appreciate, its, merits, this, lack, of, interest, and, underestimation, of, the, power, of, the, arquebus, greatly, contributed, to, the, failures, of, the, korean, army, early, in, the, war, in, april, 1590, the, korean, ambassadors, including, hwang, yun, gil, and, kim, saung, il, left, for, kyoto, where, they, waited, for, two, months, while, hideyoshi, was, finishing, his, campaign, against, the, hojo, clan, upon, his, return, they, exchanged, ceremonial, gifts, and, delivered, king, seonjo, s, letter, to, hideyoshi, hideyoshi, mistakenly, assumed, that, the, koreans, had, come, to, pay, a, tributary, homage, to, japan, for, this, reason, the, ambassadors, were, not, given, the, formal, treatment, that, was, due, to, diplomatic, representatives, in, the, end, the, korean, ambassadors, asked, for, hideyoshi, to, write, a, reply, to, the, korean, king, for, which, they, waited, 20, days, at, the, port, of, sakai, the, letter, redrafted, as, requested, by, the, ambassadors, on, the, ground, that, it, was, too, discourteous, invited, korea, to, submit, to, japan, and, join, in, a, war, against, china, upon, the, ambassadors, return, the, joseon, court, held, serious, discussions, concerning, japan, s, invitation, while, hwang, yun, gil, reported, conflicting, estimates, of, japanese, military, strength, and, intentions, they, nonetheless, pressed, that, a, war, was, imminent, kim, saung, il, claimed, that, hideyoshi, s, letter, was, nothing, but, a, bluff, moreover, the, court, aware, only, that, japan, was, in, turmoil, with, various, clan, armies, fighting, each, other, substantially, underrated, the, combined, strength, and, abilities, of, many, japanese, armies, at, the, time, some, including, king, seonjo, argued, that, ming, should, be, informed, about, the, dealings, with, japan, as, failure, to, do, so, could, make, ming, suspect, korea, s, allegiance, but, the, court, finally, concluded, to, wait, further, until, the, appropriate, course, of, action, became, definite, in, the, end, hideyoshi, s, diplomatic, negotiations, did, not, produce, the, desired, result, with, korea, the, joseon, court, approached, japan, as, a, country, inferior, to, korea, and, saw, itself, as, superior, according, to, its, favored, position, within, the, chinese, tributary, system, it, mistakenly, evaluated, hideyoshi, s, threats, of, invasions, to, be, no, better, than, the, common, wokou, japanese, pirate, raids, the, korean, court, handed, to, shigenobu, and, genso, hideyoshi, s, third, embassy, king, seonjo, s, letter, rebuking, hideyoshi, for, challenging, the, chinese, tributary, system, hideyoshi, replied, with, another, letter, but, since, it, was, not, presented, by, a, diplomat, in, person, as, expected, by, custom, the, court, ignored, it, after, this, denial, of, his, second, request, hideyoshi, proceeded, to, launch, his, armies, against, korea, in, 1592, at, the, core, of, the, japanese, military, were, the, samurai, the, military, caste, of, japan, who, dominated, japanese, society, japanese, society, was, divided, into, four, castes, samurai, peasants, artisans, and, merchants, in, that, order, the, samurai, caste, owned, most, of, the, land, in, japan, had, the, sole, right, to, carry, swords, and, to, execute, on, the, spot, any, commoner, who, was, insufficiently, deferential, and, were, allowed, to, own, horses, and, ride, into, battle, the, standard, samurai, weapon, by, 1592, was, the, yari, a, spear, meant, to, stab, often, with, a, cross, blade, that, allowed, a, samurai, to, pull, his, opponent, from, his, horse, if, samurai, wished, to, cut, his, opponent, rather, than, stab, the, weapons, were, the, dachi, an, extremely, long, sword, with, a, huge, handle, or, the, naginata, a, polearm, with, very, sharp, curved, blade, the, most, famous, of, all, the, samurai, weapons, was, the, katana, a, sword, described, by, the, british, military, historian, stephen, turnbull, as, the, finest, edged, weapon, in, the, history, of, warfare, samurai, never, carried, shields, with, the, katana, being, used, to, deflect, blows, by, 1592, the, armor, of, the, samurai, was, lamellae, made, from, iron, or, leather, scales, tied, together, which, had, been, modified, to, include, solid, plate, to, help, protect, the, samurai, from, bullets, samurai, engaged, in, psychological, warfare, by, wearing, an, iron, mask, into, battle, with, a, mustache, made, of, horsehair, and, a, sinister, grin, attached, to, the, outside, overall, 158, 800, soldiers, laborers, and, transport, troops, of, whom, a, quarter, had, firearms, were, prepared, to, take, part, in, the, invasion, with, roughly, a, third, of, the, force, being, armed, fighting, units, samurai, their, attendants, and, ashigaru, conscripts, while, the, other, two, thirds, filled, a, support, ion, doctors, priests, secretaries, boatmen, and, labourers, the, following, table, shows, the, forces, of, got, sumiharu, who, held, the, fief, of, fukue, assessed, at, 140, 000, koku, on, the, got, archipelago, family, records, show, he, led, a, force, of, 705, with, 27, horses, 220, of, which, were, fighting, men, while, 485, filled, a, support, role, the, breakdown, of, the, fighting, contingent, was, the, following, another, daimy, whose, military, service, quota, has, been, preserved, in, a, written, record, is, shimazu, yoshihiro, whose, contribution, consisted, of, the, majority, of, the, japanese, fighting, troops, sent, into, korea, were, ashigaru, light, infantry, who, were, usually, conscripted, peasants, armed, with, spears, tanegashima, japanese, arquebuses, or, yumi, japanese, bows, unlike, the, samurai, with, their, expensive, suits, of, armor, the, ashigaru, wore, cheap, suits, of, iron, armour, around, their, chests, the, ashigaru, armed, with, arquebuses, were, trained, to, fight, in, the, european, style, with, the, men, trained, to, fire, their, guns, in, formation, to, create, a, volley, of, fire, then, to, go, down, on, their, knees, to, reload, while, the, men, behind, them, fired, and, the, cycle, repeated, over, and, over, again, the, commander, of, the, japanese, first, division, and, overall, commander, of, the, invasion, force, was, konishi, yukinaga, a, daimy, of, uto, from, higo, province, in, kyushu, chosen, as, commander, of, the, invasion, force, more, because, of, his, diplomatic, skills, than, military, skills, as, toyotomi, hideyoshi, did, not, expect, the, koreans, to, resist, konishi, had, converted, to, catholicism, in, 1583, and, was, known, to, the, spanish, and, portuguese, as, dom, agostinho, kat, kiyomasa, who, led, the, second, division, into, korea, was, known, in, japan, as, toranosuke, the, young, tiger, and, to, the, koreans, as, the, devil, general, on, account, of, his, ferocity, kat, was, one, of, the, seven, spears, of, shizugatake, a, group, of, seven, samurai, who, distinguished, themselves, in, combat, at, the, battle, of, shizugatake, in, 1583, where, samurai, had, fought, one, another, mano, a, mano, and, where, kat, demonstrated, his, skills, with, a, cross, bladed, spear, with, great, effect, by, cutting, so, many, men, whose, severed, and, salted, heads, were, thereafter, tied, to, a, stalk, of, green, bamboo, and, carried, by, one, of, kat, s, attendants, into, battle, kat, was, a, devoted, follower, of, nichiren, buddhism, a, type, of, buddhism, closely, associated, with, militarism, and, ultra, nationalism, in, japan, and, his, relations, with, the, catholic, konishi, were, extremely, unfriendly, to, the, extent, that, the, two, men, almost, never, met, during, the, campaign, in, korea, kat, s, battle, standard, was, a, white, pennant, which, carried, a, message, alleged, to, have, been, written, by, nichiren, himself, reading, namu, my, h, renge, ky, hail, to, the, lotus, of, the, divine, law, the, naval, commander, was, wakisaka, yasuharu, another, of, the, seven, spears, of, shizugatake, who, had, been, named, daimy, of, the, island, of, awaji, in, the, seto, inland, sea, in, 1585, where, he, learned, much, about, seafaring, as, the, island, is, located, close, to, whirlpools, which, are, notoriously, dangerous, for, sailors, toyotomi, hideyoshi, never, left, japan, remaining, near, kyoto, however, the, idea, of, conquering, china, was, his, obsession, and, throughout, the, war, he, refused, to, accept, defeat, treating, the, war, as, simply, a, question, of, willpower, believing, if, only, his, samurai, fought, hard, enough, he, could, take, china, turnbull, writes, in, a, tactical, sense, therefore, hideyoshi, cannot, be, considered, as, one, of, the, commanders, but, as, his, will, drove, the, whole, project, along, until, he, died, his, political, influence, cannot, be, underestimated, the, ming, chinese, army, was, the, largest, in, asia, with, a, total, of, around, 845, 000, troops, however, in, 1592, the, imperial, army, was, engaged, in, wars, with, the, mongols, and, in, crushing, a, rebellion, in, the, northwest, the, ming, army, was, capable, of, considerable, feats, of, organization, for, example, bringing, 400, artillery, guns, across, 480, km, of, harsh, landscape, to, provide, firepower, against, the, mongols, the, core, of, the, ming, army, was, the, infantry, divided, into, five, sections, those, armed, with, guns, swords, archers, with, fire, arrows, archers, with, ordinary, arrows, and, spearmen, backed, up, by, the, cavalry, and, artillery, the, basic, weapons, for, the, chinese, infantry, were, the, crossbow, and, the, arquebus, while, the, cavalry, were, usually, mounted, archers, chinese, infantry, wore, conical, iron, helmets, and, suits, of, armor, made, from, leather, or, iron, according, to, turnbull, chinese, field, artillery, and, siege, cannon, were, the, finest, in, the, region, chinese, artillery, was, made, from, cast, iron, and, were, divided, into, several, types, the, most, important, being, the, great, general, gun, and, the, folang, zhi, the, latter, being, breech, loaded, artillery, guns, one, of, the, chinese, commanders, was, li, rusong, a, man, who, has, been, traditionally, disparaged, in, japanese, accounts, in, turnbull, s, estimate, he, was, one, of, ming, china, s, most, accomplished, generals, although, li, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, pyokjeyek, his, defeat, was, temporary, he, was, an, able, strategist, who, achieved, his, goal, of, forcing, the, japanese, out, of, korea, and, japanese, accounts, focusing, on, his, defeat, at, pyokjeyek, served, to, distract, from, his, achievements, another, chinese, naval, commander, was, chen, lin, a, native, of, guangdong, who, proved, pivotal, in, defeating, japan, and, defending, korea, after, helping, win, the, war, chen, was, celebrated, as, a, hero, in, korea, and, china, chen, subsequently, became, the, founder, of, the, gwangdong, jin, clan, of, korea, and, today, his, descendants, are, spread, across, china, and, korea, chen, was, given, the, nickname, guangdong, master, for, his, naval, and, military, accomplishments, officers, in, the, joseon, army, and, navy, came, exclusively, from, the, aristocracy, but, unlike, the, high, militarist, japanese, aristocracy, trained, to, be, soldiers, from, their, youth, onward, for, the, joseon, aristocracy, scholarship, was, valued, and, war, was, disparaged, as, something, unworthy, of, a, confucian, gentleman, scholar, the, quality, of, korean, generalship, was, very, variable, with, some, korean, officers, being, able, and, others, being, men, who, had, not, devoted, much, time, to, the, study, of, war, preferring, archery, writing, practicing, their, calligraphy, and, reading, confucian, classics, at, the, end, of, the, period, of, chaos, after, the, collapse, of, the, yuan, dynasty, joseon, was, mainly, focused, on, dealing, with, the, looting, of, the, jurchen, people, and, japanese, pirates, in, the, north, during, the, reign, of, king, jeongjong, in, 1400, the, private, army, system, was, overthrown, and, during, the, reign, of, king, sejo, in, 1457, a, unit, called, five, guards, owi, was, formed, which, continued, until, the, imjin, war, in, the, early, days, of, the, war, joseon, had, a, conscripted, light, infantry, standing, army, and, an, elite, cavalry, oriented, organization, especially, horse, archer, it, was, specialized, in, dealing, with, nomadic, looters, however, as, the, joseon, army, was, easily, defeated, in, the, early, days, of, the, imjin, war, the, joseon, government, felt, limited, in, the, five, guard, system, and, switched, to, the, five, army, camps, system, light, infantry, protected, their, chests, by, wearing, eomsimgap, which, was, made, of, leather, over, a, cloth, robe, that, served, a, similar, function, to, the, gambeson, or, by, wearing, scale, armour, pengbaesu, heavy, infantry, specializing, in, hand, to, hand, combat, were, the, mainstay, of, early, joseon, infantry, wearing, chain, mail, or, mail, and, plate, armour, and, armed, with, a, round, shield, and, sword, they, responded, to, nomadic, raids, with, shields, and, knives, in, mountain, warfare, and, in, the, plains, they, built, a, shield, wall, to, deter, the, cavalry, s, attacks, the, elite, troops, and, officers, made, up, of, noblemen, s, sons, called, gapsa, they, had, to, have, more, than, a, certain, amount, of, wealth, to, take, the, qualification, exam, instead, of, being, treated, as, a, bureaucrat, of, a, certain, class, and, receiving, a, salary, from, the, state, the, military, horses, and, servants, food, expenses, were, all, on, their, own, for, this, reason, the, joseon, government, which, had, to, save, the, budget, tried, to, increase, the, number, of, gapsa, by, increasing, the, lower, ranks, as, a, result, the, number, of, gapsa, increases, to, 14000, by, 1475, but, the, standing, army, which, actually, has, to, maintain, a, certain, number, is, not, managed, causing, a, problem, that, most, of, the, numbers, are, falsely, stated, just, before, the, war, they, wore, brigandine, armor, which, was, popular, in, manchuria, and, mongolia, at, the, time, this, is, called, dujeong, gap, it, is, often, misunderstood, that, they, are, not, wearing, korean, military, armor, due, to, the, influence, of, paintings, or, media, made, after, the, war, but, this, is, not, true, as, an, example, lu, s, fr, is, wrote, in, the, historia, de, japam, that, the, joseon, army, wore, solid, leather, armor, and, european, style, steel, caps, some, of, which, wore, cast, iron, or, iron, armor, records, of, distributing, or, inspecting, the, armor, of, joseon, soldiers, during, the, war, can, be, found, in, the, annals, of, the, joseon, dynasty, and, the, nanjung, ilgi, but, no, records, have, been, confirmed, that, the, joseon, army, fought, without, armor, the, wrongly, known, identity, of, the, joseon, army, is, a, terminal, police, officer, belonging, to, the, podocheong, a, secuization, of, the, joseon, dynasty, the, standard, korean, sword, was, the, hwando, a, curved, sword, commonly, used, by, joseon, soldiers, during, peacetime, that, is, shorter, but, lighter, than, its, japanese, counterpart, a, uniquely, korean, weapon, was, the, flail, a, 1, 5, metre, long, 4, 9, ft, hardwood, stick, painted, red, acting, as, the, handle, for, a, chain, attached, to, a, shaft, with, iron, nails, joseon, infantrymen, often, fought, as, archers, and, a, japanese, source, from, 1592, commented, koreans, were, superior, as, soldiers, to, the, japanese, only, as, archers, because, their, bows, had, a, range, of, 450, metres, 1, 480, ft, against, the, 300, metres, 980, ft, of, japanese, archers, turnbull, wrote, that, korea, s, salvation, was, its, navy, the, standard, korean, ship, was, the, panokseon, a, warship, that, was, not, much, different, in, appearance, from, the, standard, japanese, warships, except, for, the, fact, that, korean, ships, were, larger, and, carried, heavy, cannons, while, the, japanese, ships, did, not, the, famous, turtle, ships, that, were, heavily, armored, and, armed, and, that, were, to, wreak, havoc, on, the, japanese, ships, were, a, minority, of, the, korean, navy, s, ships, korean, and, japanese, accounts, both, talk, much, of, the, turtle, ships, but, no, such, ship, has, survived, and, historians, still, debate, about, what, turtle, ships, looked, like, though, most, now, agree, that, they, were, in, fact, turtle, shaped, admiral, yi, sun, sin, who, began, the, war, as, the, left, naval, commander, of, jeolla, province, was, to, become, the, commander, of, the, korean, navy, and, was, described, by, turnbull, as, korea, s, greatest, hero, and, one, of, the, outstanding, naval, commanders, in, the, entire, history, of, the, world, the, two, major, security, threats, to, joseon, and, ming, china, at, the, time, were, the, jurchen, people, who, raided, along, the, northern, borders, and, the, wokou, who, pillaged, the, coastal, villages, and, trade, ships, this, defensive, stance, within, an, environment, of, relative, peace, pushed, the, koreans, to, depend, on, the, strength, of, their, fortresses, and, warships, with, the, transmission, of, gunpowder, and, firearms, technology, from, china, during, goryeo, korea, improved, upon, the, original, chinese, firearm, designs, the, thunder, crash, bomb, and, developed, advanced, cannon, which, were, used, with, great, efficiency, at, sea, even, though, china, was, the, main, source, of, new, military, technologies, in, asia, korea, was, a, manufacturing, base, for, both, cannon, and, shipbuilding, during, this, era, japan, on, the, other, hand, had, been, in, a, state, of, civil, war, for, over, a, century, which, had, the, result, of, turning, the, island, nation, into, a, very, proficient, warlike, society, when, traders, from, the, portuguese, empire, arrived, in, japan, and, introduced, arquebuses, and, muskets, the, japanese, warlords, were, quick, to, adapt, to, this, disruptive, innovation, producing, en, masse, the, tanegashima, matchlock, in, the, ongoing, civil, strife, the, japanese, refined, the, drills, and, tactics, to, make, best, use, of, the, new, weapon, thus, giving, them, a, great, advantage, over, the, korean, armies, korean, cannon, were, not, adapted, for, effective, use, on, land, and, firearms, were, of, a, less, advanced, design, the, small, arms, carried, by, japanese, soldiers, proved, to, be, particularly, effective, during, land, engagements, and, sieges, this, strategic, difference, in, weapons, development, and, implementation, contributed, to, the, trend, during, the, war, of, japanese, dominance, on, land, and, korean, dominance, at, sea, as, japan, had, been, at, war, since, the, mid, 15th, century, toyotomi, hideyoshi, had, 500, 000, battle, hardened, soldiers, at, his, disposal, to, form, a, remarkable, professional, army, in, asia, for, the, invasion, of, korea, while, japan, s, chaotic, state, had, left, the, koreans, with, a, very, low, estimate, of, japan, as, a, military, threat, there, was, a, new, sense, of, unity, among, the, different, political, factions, in, japan, as, indicated, by, the, sword, hunt, in, 1588, the, confiscation, of, all, weapons, from, the, peasants, along, with, the, hunt, came, the, separation, edict, in, 1591, which, effectively, put, an, end, to, all, japanese, wokou, piracy, by, prohibiting, the, daimy, s, from, supporting, the, pirates, within, their, fiefs, ironically, the, koreans, believed, that, hideyoshi, s, invasion, would, be, just, an, extension, of, the, previous, pirate, raids, that, had, been, repelled, before, as, for, the, military, situation, in, joseon, the, korean, scholar, official, ryu, seong, ryong, observed, not, one, in, a, hundred, knew, the, methods, of, drilling, soldiers, rising, in, rank, depended, far, more, on, social, connections, than, military, knowledge, korean, soldiers, were, disorganized, ill, trained, and, ill, equipped, and, they, had, been, used, mostly, in, construction, projects, such, as, building, castle, walls, there, were, several, defects, with, the, organization, of, the, joseon, era, korean, military, defense, system, one, example, was, a, policy, that, stated, that, local, officers, could, not, individually, respond, to, a, foreign, invasion, outside, of, their, jurisdiction, until, a, higher, ranking, general, appointed, by, the, king, s, court, arrived, with, a, newly, mobilized, army, this, arrangement, was, highly, inefficient, since, the, nearby, forces, would, remain, stationary, until, the, mobile, border, commander, arrived, on, the, scene, and, took, control, secondly, as, the, appointed, general, often, came, from, an, outside, region, he, was, likely, to, be, unfamiliar, with, the, natural, environment, the, available, technology, and, manpower, of, the, invaded, region, finally, as, a, main, army, was, never, maintained, new, and, ill, trained, recruits, conscripted, during, war, constituted, a, significant, part, of, the, army, the, korean, court, managed, to, carry, out, some, reforms, but, they, remained, problematic, for, example, the, military, training, center, established, in, 1589, in, gyeongsang, province, recruited, mostly, men, either, too, young, or, too, old, to, be, good, soldiers, augmented, by, some, adventure, seeking, aristocrats, and, slaves, buying, their, freedom, because, able, bodied, men, of, the, right, age, targeted, by, the, policy, had, higher, priorities, such, as, farming, and, other, economic, activities, the, dominant, form, of, the, korean, fortresses, was, the, sanseong, mountain, fortress, which, consisted, of, a, stone, wall, that, continued, around, a, mountain, in, a, serpentine, fashion, these, walls, were, poorly, designed, with, little, use, of, towers, and, cross, fire, positions, usually, seen, in, european, fortifications, and, were, mostly, low, in, height, it, was, a, wartime, policy, for, these, fortresses, to, serve, as, refuge, castles, and, for, everyone, to, evacuate, to, one, with, those, who, failed, to, do, so, being, assumed, to, be, collaborators, with, the, enemy, however, the, policy, never, held, any, great, effect, because, the, fortresses, were, out, of, reach, for, most, refugees, toyotomi, hideyoshi, mobilized, his, army, at, nagoya, castle, located, in, the, old, hizen, province, on, kyushu, newly, built, for, the, sole, purpose, of, housing, the, invasion, forces, and, the, reserves, none, of, the, original, structures, remain, but, the, castle, s, ruined, foundations, survive, in, the, formerly, separate, town, of, chinzei, now, part, of, the, city, of, karatsu, in, saga, prefecture, the, first, invasion, consisted, of, nine, divisions, totaling, 158, 800, men, of, which, the, last, two, of, 21, 500, were, stationed, as, reserves, on, tsushima, island, and, iki, island, respectively, the, japanese, used, a, total, of, 320, 000, troops, throughout, the, entire, war, on, the, other, side, joseon, maintained, only, a, few, military, units, with, no, field, army, and, its, defense, depended, heavily, on, the, mobilization, of, the, citizen, soldiers, in, case, of, emergency, during, the, first, invasion, joseon, deployed, a, total, of, 84, 500, regular, troops, throughout, assisted, by, 22, 000, irregular, volunteers, ming, troops, never, numbered, more, than, 60, 000, troops, in, korea, at, any, point, of, the, war, over, the, course, of, the, war, the, ming, sent, in, total, 166, 700, troops, and, also, sent, 17, million, liang, worth, of, silver, and, supplies, to, korea, equivalent, to, about, half, a, year, of, revenue, for, the, ming, empire, since, its, introduction, by, the, portuguese, traders, on, the, island, of, tanegashima, in, 1543, the, arquebus, had, become, widely, used, in, japan, while, both, korea, and, china, had, also, been, introduced, to, firearms, similar, to, the, portuguese, arquebus, most, were, older, models, the, korean, soldiers, small, arms, were, hand, cannons, with, a, simple, mechanism, and, with, either, a, gunstock, or, wooden, shaft, attached, after, the, japanese, diplomats, presented, the, korean, court, arquebuses, as, gifts, the, korean, scholar, official, ryu, seong, ryong, advocated, the, use, of, the, new, weapon, but, the, korean, court, failed, to, realize, its, potency, in, contrast, the, japanese, often, deployed, the, arquebus, in, combination, with, archery, in, war, during, siege, actions, chinese, deployed, rattan, shields, and, iron, pavises, large, shields, reputed, to, be, musket, proof, the, chinese, used, a, variety, of, weapons, including, the, short, bow, swords, firearms, early, kinds, of, land, mines, and, early, hand, grenades, the, koreans, also, demonstrated, massive, use, of, hwacha, multiple, rocket, propelled, arrows, notably, during, the, siege, of, pyongyang, in, january, 1593, it, had, the, ability, to, fire, up, to, 200, singijeon, a, type, of, rocket, arrow, all, at, one, time, the, hwacha, consisted, of, a, two, wheeled, cart, carrying, a, board, filled, with, holes, into, which, the, singijeon, were, inserted, although, the, chinese, had, their, own, rocket, arrows, the, chinese, opted, for, hand, carried, hu, dun, pao, or, crouching, tiger, cannons, the, japanese, defeated, successive, korean, armies, with, a, combination, of, muskets, spears, and, swords, while, muskets, used, by, the, japanese, were, superior, to, korean, bows, in, terms, of, penetration, and, range, the, former, lacked, the, fire, rate, of, the, latter, numerous, battle, accounts, from, the, annal, of, joseon, dynasty, and, various, essays, diaries, of, korean, officials, and, korean, sword, show, that, musket, alone, could, not, ensure, victory, by, employing, both, musket, and, arme, blanche, white, weapons, i, e, metal, swords, lances, spears, and, the, like, the, japanese, were, able, to, achieve, success, during, the, early, phase, of, the, war, indeed, the, ferocious, charge, of, japanese, troops, with, spears, and, swords, were, often, more, decisive, than, with, muskets, this, was, because, the, koreans, were, poorly, trained, in, close, combat, and, lacked, battlefield, experience, and, discipline, thus, korean, soldiers, were, unable, to, hold, their, line, against, charging, japanese, soldiers, the, following, words, from, a, korean, military, official, named, shi, eon, lee, to, the, korean, king, discusses, this, weakness, the, king, asked, him, you, have, already, told, me, about, the, low, accuracy, of, japanese, muskets, why, then, are, korean, armies, having, great, problem, with, defeating, them, then, answered, the, korean, soldiers, cower, before, the, enemy, and, flee, for, their, lives, even, before, they, have, engaged, the, enemy, as, for, the, commanders, they, seldom, leave, their, positions, because, they, fear, that, they, might, be, executed, for, deserting, however, there, is, a, limit, to, executing, deserting, soldiers, since, there, are, so, many, of, them, truly, the, japanese, aren, t, good, musketeers, but, they, advance, so, rapidly, that, they, appear, right, in, front, of, the, koreans, in, the, time, koreans, can, shoot, only, two, arrows, it, is, said, that, koreans, are, good, archers, but, they, seldom, hit, the, targets, when, the, enemy, is, too, far, away, and, are, too, scared, to, shoot, when, the, enemy, is, near, because, they, fear, japanese, swords, archery, often, becomes, useless, because, koreans, fearing, the, japanese, arme, blanche, can, barely, shoot, the, japanese, are, reputed, to, be, good, swordsmen, but, it, is, possible, for, koreans, to, draw, swords, and, hold, their, ground, however, the, koreans, seldom, do, this, and, merely, run, for, their, lives, however, another, korean, official, yu, song, nyong, claims, that, the, japanese, arquebusiers, had, undeniable, superiority, over, long, distances, which, along, with, low, discipline, and, combat, experience, of, the, korean, army, was, the, main, cause, of, defeats, in, the, 1592, invasion, everything, was, swept, away, within, a, fortnight, or, a, month, the, cities, and, fortresses, were, lost, and, everything, in, the, eight, directions, had, crumbled, although, it, was, due, to, there, having, been, a, century, of, peace, and, the, people, not, being, familiar, with, warfare, that, this, happened, it, was, really, because, the, japanese, had, the, use, of, muskets, that, could, reach, beyond, several, hundred, paces, that, always, pierced, what, they, struck, that, came, like, the, wind, and, the, hail, and, with, which, bows, and, arrows, could, not, compare, today, the, japanese, exclusively, use, muskets, to, attack, fortifications, they, can, reach, from, several, hundred, paces, away, our, country, s, bows, and, arrows, cannot, reach, them, at, any, flat, spot, outside, the, walls, the, japanese, will, build, earthen, mounds, and, flying, towers, they, look, down, into, the, fortifications, and, fire, their, bullets, so, that, the, people, inside, the, fortifications, cannot, conceal, themselves, in, the, end, the, fortifications, are, taken, one, cannot, blame, for, their, situation, japanese, soldiers, also, relied, on, their, advantage, in, ranged, combat, one, of, the, japanese, commanders, wrote, home, in, 1592, please, arrange, to, send, us, guns, and, ammunition, there, is, absolutely, no, use, for, spears, it, is, vital, that, you, arrange, somehow, to, obtain, a, number, of, guns, furthermore, you, should, certainly, see, to, it, that, those, person, departing, understand, this, situation, the, arrangements, for, guns, should, receive, your, closest, attention, the, japanese, commander, asano, yoshinaga, wrote, home, to, his, father, when, the, troops, come, from, the, province, of, kai, have, them, bring, as, many, guns, as, possible, for, no, other, equipment, is, needed, give, strict, orders, that, all, men, even, the, samurai, carry, guns, the, koreans, seldom, employed, field, artillery, with, cannon, being, mainly, used, in, siege, action, and, for, defending, castles, there, were, only, very, few, instances, of, koreans, employing, artillery, in, the, field, with, largely, ineffective, results, some, irregular, korean, units, with, government, supplied, weapons, fired, explosive, shells, from, mortars, but, this, occurred, only, in, isolated, instances, the, chinese, were, more, active, in, employing, field, artillery, than, the, koreans, one, of, the, notable, chinese, field, guns, was, the, great, general, cannon, a, large, breech, loading, cannon, with, a, two, wheeled, cart, shooting, an, iron, ball, weighing, about, 10, kilograms, the, japanese, employed, field, artillery, only, where, strategically, advantageous, in, both, siege, and, field, warfare, situations, often, using, captured, pieces, where, available, the, koreans, actively, deployed, their, cavalry, divisions, in, action, but, the, terrain, was, often, mountainous, which, was, not, generally, suitable, for, cavalry, the, farmland, tended, to, have, many, ditches, and, it, was, often, barren, and, lacked, grass, essential, for, feeding, the, horses, in, addition, japanese, use, of, the, arquebus, at, long, range, and, in, concentrated, volleys, negated, any, possibility, of, effective, cavalry, tactics, the, korean, cavalrymen, s, primary, weapons, were, bows, with, swords, and, lances, holding, only, subsidiary, positions, most, cavalry, action, for, the, koreans, took, place, in, the, battle, of, chungju, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, where, they, were, outnumbered, and, wiped, out, by, japanese, infantry, although, the, japanese, divisions, also, fielded, cavalry, they, usually, dismounted, when, engaged, in, action, acting, more, as, mounted, infantry, while, specialized, firearms, were, used, on, horseback, most, cavalrymen, preferred, the, conventional, yari, spear, but, its, use, was, limited, by, the, increasing, use, of, firearms, by, the, koreans, and, chinese, in, contrast, to, the, japanese, advantages, on, land, the, koreans, possessed, an, advantage, at, sea, because, of, advanced, artillery, and, shipbuilding, technology, along, with, an, extensive, naval, history, against, japanese, pirates, the, korean, navies, fielded, highly, advanced, and, formidable, ships, by, the, time, of, the, japanese, invasion, korea, employed, the, panokseon, a, powerful, galley, type, ship, armed, with, cannon, that, outranged, most, japanese, vessels, the, korean, navy, used, this, naval, superiority, to, disrupt, the, japanese, logistical, network, off, the, west, coast, of, the, korean, peninsula, this, advantage, however, did, not, affect, japan, s, ability, to, continuously, reinforce, its, armies, through, the, supply, route, from, tsushima, in, japan, to, busan, in, korea, especially, once, korean, naval, bases, in, the, immediate, area, were, neutralized, by, japanese, ground, forces, the, korean, navy, led, by, yi, sun, sin, would, withdraw, and, re, base, in, the, northern, border, of, jeolla, province, while, not, able, to, entirely, prevent, reinforcement, the, korean, navy, continued, to, harass, and, inflict, losses, on, the, japanese, supply, fleets, throughout, the, duration, of, the, war, as, virtually, all, japanese, ships, in, the, first, phase, of, the, war, lacked, cannon, artillery, korean, ships, outranged, and, bombarded, japanese, ships, with, impunity, outside, the, range, of, the, japanese, muskets, arrows, and, catapults, when, the, japanese, attempted, to, outfit, cannon, to, their, ships, their, lightweight, ship, design, prohibited, using, more, than, a, few, per, vessel, and, vessels, usually, lacked, the, firepower, or, range, of, their, korean, counterparts, in, order, to, bolster, their, fleet, the, japanese, considered, employing, two, portuguese, galleons, in, the, invasion, in, addition, to, a, lack, of, effective, naval, armament, most, japanese, ships, were, modified, merchant, vessels, more, suited, for, transportation, of, troops, and, equipment, than, fielding, artillery, weapons, during, the, period, between, the, first, and, second, invasions, the, korean, government, had, a, chance, to, examine, the, reasons, why, they, had, been, easily, overrun, by, the, japanese, ryu, seong, ryong, the, prime, minister, spoke, out, about, the, korean, disadvantages, ryu, pointed, out, that, korean, castle, defenses, were, extremely, weak, a, fact, which, he, had, pointed, out, before, the, war, he, noted, how, korean, castles, had, incomplete, fortifications, and, walls, that, were, too, easy, to, scale, he, also, wanted, cannons, set, up, in, the, walls, ryu, proposed, building, strong, towers, with, gun, turrets, for, cannons, besides, castles, ryu, wanted, to, form, a, line, of, defenses, in, korea, in, this, kind, of, defense, the, enemy, would, have, to, scale, many, walls, in, order, to, reach, the, capital, hanseong, ryu, also, pointed, out, how, efficient, the, japanese, army, was, since, it, took, them, only, one, month, to, reach, hanseong, and, how, well, organized, the, japanese, were, he, noted, how, the, japanese, moved, their, units, in, complex, maneuvers, often, weakening, their, enemy, with, the, use, of, arquebuses, then, attacking, with, melee, weapons, king, seonjo, and, the, korean, court, finally, began, to, reform, the, military, in, september, 1593, the, military, training, agency, korean, alternately, translated, as, military, training, command, was, established, the, agency, carefully, divided, the, army, into, units, and, companies, within, the, companies, were, squads, of, archers, arquebusiers, swordsmen, and, spear, infantry, the, agency, set, up, divisional, units, in, each, region, of, korea, and, garrisoned, battalions, at, castles, the, agency, which, originally, had, less, than, 80, troops, soon, grew, to, about, 10, 000, one, of, the, most, important, changes, was, that, both, upper, class, citizens, and, slaves, were, subject, to, the, draft, all, males, had, to, enter, military, service, to, be, trained, and, familiarized, with, weapons, it, was, also, around, this, time, that, the, military, officer, and, military, scholar, han, gyo, korean, wrote, the, martial, arts, manual, muyejebo, based, on, the, book, jixiao, xinshu, by, the, famous, chinese, general, qi, jiguang, on, may, 23, 1592, the, first, division, of, the, japanese, invasion, army, consisting, of, 7, 000, men, led, by, konishi, yukinaga, left, tsushima, in, the, morning, and, arrived, outside, the, port, city, of, busan, in, the, evening, korean, naval, intelligence, had, detected, the, japanese, fleet, but, won, gyun, the, right, naval, commander, of, gyeongsang, province, misidentified, the, fleet, as, trading, vessels, on, a, mission, a, later, report, of, the, arrival, of, an, additional, 100, japanese, vessels, raised, his, suspicions, but, he, did, nothing, about, it, s, yoshitoshi, landed, alone, on, the, busan, shore, to, ask, the, koreans, for, safe, passage, to, china, one, last, time, the, koreans, refused, as, they, had, previously, done, and, s, yoshitoshi, laid, siege, to, the, city, konishi, yukinaga, attacked, the, nearby, fort, of, dadaejin, the, next, morning, japanese, accounts, claim, that, the, battles, resulted, in, the, complete, annihilation, of, korean, forces, one, claims, 8, 500, deaths, and, another, 30, 000, heads, while, a, korean, account, claims, that, the, japanese, themselves, took, significant, losses, before, sacking, the, city, of, busan, jeong, bal, the, korean, commander, at, busan, was, killed, by, a, japanese, bullet, and, with, his, death, korean, morale, collapsed, in, the, meantime, konishi, took, the, fort, of, dadaejin, where, under, heavy, volleys, of, supporting, fire, the, japanese, were, able, to, place, ladders, against, the, walls, and, took, the, fort, konishi, ordered, that, no, prisoners, be, taken, and, the, entire, garrison, was, massacred, konishi, and, the, first, division, then, turned, north, marching, to, take, hanseong, the, disciplined, japanese, brought, down, a, rain, of, bullets, that, was, lethal, to, anyone, not, taking, cover, on, the, morning, of, may, 25, 1592, the, first, division, arrived, at, the, dongnae, fortress, konishi, sent, a, message, to, song, sang, hyeon, the, commander, of, the, fortress, explaining, to, him, that, his, objective, was, the, conquest, of, china, and, if, the, koreans, would, just, submit, their, lives, would, be, spared, song, replied, it, is, easy, for, me, to, die, but, difficult, to, let, you, pass, which, led, konishi, to, order, that, no, prisoners, be, taken, to, punish, song, for, his, defiance, the, resulting, siege, of, dongnae, lasted, twelve, hours, killed, 3, 000, and, resulted, in, a, japanese, victory, the, japanese, took, no, prisoners, and, killed, everyone, at, dongnae, civilian, and, military, even, killing, all, of, the, cats, and, dogs, there, konishi, s, intention, was, to, terrify, the, koreans, into, submission, by, showing, them, what, the, price, of, resisting, japan, was, but, he, instead, stimulated, korean, resistance, as, ordinary, koreans, were, enraged, at, an, enemy, who, invaded, without, provocation, and, behaved, so, brutally, after, taking, dongnae, konishi, took, the, castle, of, miryang, which, he, followed, up, by, taking, daegu, which, surrendered, without, opposition, as, the, koreans, were, concentrating, their, army, further, north, having, crossed, the, nakdong, river, konishi, learned, that, the, koreans, were, concentrating, their, troops, at, sangju, in, the, meantime, desperate, korean, envoys, had, been, sent, to, the, forbidden, city, in, beijing, to, ask, the, wanli, emperor, to, protect, his, loyal, tributaries, in, korea, by, sending, an, army, to, drive, out, the, japanese, the, chinese, assured, the, koreans, that, an, army, would, be, sent, but, they, were, engaged, in, a, major, war, in, ningxia, and, the, koreans, would, have, to, wait, for, the, arrival, of, their, assistance, kat, kiyomasa, s, second, division, landed, in, busan, on, may, 27, and, kuroda, nagamasa, s, third, division, west, of, nakdong, river, on, may, 28, the, second, division, took, the, abandoned, city, of, tongdo, on, may, 28, and, captured, gyeongju, on, may, 30, the, third, division, upon, landing, captured, nearby, gimhae, castle, by, keeping, the, defenders, under, pressure, with, gunfire, while, building, ramps, up, to, the, walls, with, bundles, of, crops, by, june, 3, the, third, division, captured, unsan, changnyeong, hyeonpung, and, seongju, meanwhile, konishi, yukinaga, s, first, division, passed, the, yangsan, mountain, fortress, captured, on, the, night, of, the, siege, of, dongnae, when, its, defenders, fled, after, the, japanese, scouting, parties, fired, their, arquebuses, and, captured, miryang, castle, on, the, afternoon, of, may, 26, the, first, division, secured, the, cheongdo, fortress, in, the, next, few, days, and, destroyed, the, city, of, daegu, by, june, 3, the, first, division, crossed, the, nakdong, river, and, stopped, at, seonsan, mountain, upon, receiving, news, of, the, japanese, attacks, the, joseon, government, appointed, general, yi, il, as, the, mobile, border, commander, as, was, the, established, policy, general, yi, headed, to, mungyeong, near, the, beginning, of, the, strategically, important, choryong, pass, to, gather, troops, but, he, had, to, travel, further, south, to, meet, the, troops, assembled, at, the, city, of, daegu, there, general, yi, moved, all, troops, back, to, sangju, except, for, the, survivors, of, the, siege, of, dongnae, who, were, to, be, stationed, as, a, rearguard, at, the, choryong, pass, on, june, 4, general, yi, deployed, a, force, of, less, than, 1, 000, men, on, two, small, hills, to, face, the, approaching, first, division, assuming, that, the, sight, of, rising, smoke, was, from, the, burning, of, buildings, by, a, nearby, japanese, force, general, yi, sent, an, officer, to, scout, on, horseback, however, as, he, neared, a, bridge, the, officer, was, ambushed, by, japanese, musket, fire, from, below, the, bridge, and, was, beheaded, the, korean, troops, watching, him, fall, were, greatly, demoralized, soon, the, japanese, began, the, battle, of, sangju, with, their, arquebuses, the, koreans, replied, with, their, arrows, which, fell, short, of, their, targets, the, japanese, forces, having, been, divided, into, three, attacked, the, korean, lines, from, both, the, front, and, the, two, flanks, the, battle, ended, with, general, yi, il, s, retreat, and, 700, korean, casualties, general, yi, il, then, planned, to, use, the, joryeong, pass, the, only, path, through, the, western, end, of, the, sobaek, mountain, range, to, check, the, japanese, advance, however, another, commander, appointed, by, the, joseon, government, sin, rip, had, arrived, in, the, area, with, a, cavalry, division, and, moved, 100, 000, combined, troops, to, the, chungju, fortress, located, above, joryeong, pass, rather, than, face, a, siege, sin, rip, decided, to, fight, a, battle, in, the, open, fields, of, tangeumdae, which, he, felt, ideal, for, the, deployment, of, his, cavalry, unit, since, the, cavalry, consisted, mostly, of, new, recruits, however, sin, rip, was, concerned, that, his, troops, may, easily, be, tempted, to, flee, the, battle, as, a, result, he, felt, the, need, to, trap, his, forces, in, the, triangular, area, formed, by, the, convergence, of, the, tancheon, and, han, rivers, in, the, shape, of, a, y, this, field, however, was, dotted, with, flooded, rice, paddies, and, was, generally, not, suitable, for, cavalry, action, on, june, 5, 1592, the, first, division, of, approximately, 18, 000, men, led, by, konishi, yukinaga, left, sangju, and, reached, an, abandoned, fortress, at, mungyeong, by, nightfall, the, next, day, the, first, division, arrived, at, tangeumdae, in, the, early, afternoon, where, they, faced, the, korean, cavalry, unit, at, the, battle, of, chungju, konishi, divided, his, forces, into, three, and, attacked, with, arquebuses, from, both, flanks, as, well, as, the, front, the, korean, arrows, fell, short, of, the, japanese, troops, which, were, beyond, their, range, and, general, sin, s, two, charges, failed, to, break, the, japanese, lines, general, sin, then, killed, himself, in, the, river, and, the, koreans, that, tried, to, escape, by, the, river, either, drowned, or, were, decapitated, by, the, pursuing, japanese, the, second, division, led, by, kat, kiyomasa, arrived, at, chungju, with, the, third, division, camped, not, far, behind, there, kat, expressed, his, anger, against, konishi, yukinaga, for, not, waiting, at, busan, as, planned, and, attempting, to, take, all, of, the, glory, for, himself, nabeshima, naoshige, then, proposed, a, compromise, of, dividing, the, japanese, troops, into, two, separate, groups, to, follow, two, different, routes, to, hanseong, the, capital, and, present, day, seoul, and, allowing, kat, kiyomasa, to, choose, the, route, that, the, second, division, would, take, to, reach, hanseong, the, division, of, the, japanese, forces, was, mainly, due, to, the, rivalry, between, kat, and, konishi, but, there, was, a, certain, strategic, merit, in, dividing, their, forces, in, that, kat, s, advance, into, northeastern, korea, would, protect, the, japanese, from, any, attempt, by, the, jurchen, leader, nurhaci, to, attack, their, eastern, flank, however, the, division, of, the, japanese, forces, also, meant, that, konishi, would, have, to, take, on, the, chinese, alone, when, their, army, arrived, in, korea, the, two, divisions, began, the, race, to, capture, hanseong, on, june, 8, and, kat, took, the, shorter, route, across, the, han, river, while, konishi, went, further, upstream, where, smaller, waters, posed, a, lesser, barrier, konishi, arrived, at, hanseong, first, on, june, 10, while, the, second, division, was, halted, at, the, river, with, no, boats, with, which, to, cross, the, first, division, found, the, castle, undefended, with, its, gates, tightly, locked, as, king, seonjo, had, fled, the, day, before, the, japanese, broke, into, a, small, floodgate, located, in, the, castle, wall, and, opened, the, capital, city, s, gate, from, within, kat, s, second, division, arrived, at, the, capital, the, next, day, having, taken, the, same, route, as, the, first, division, and, the, third, and, fourth, divisions, the, day, after, meanwhile, the, fifth, sixth, seventh, and, eighth, divisions, had, landed, on, busan, with, the, ninth, division, kept, in, reserve, on, the, island, of, iki, parts, of,

rely, on, farm, animals, in, every, village, the, king, s, party, was, met, by, inhabitants, lined, up, by, the, road, grieving, that, their, king, was, abandoning, them, and, neglecting, their, duty, of, paying, homage, parts, of, the, southern, shore, of, the, imjin, river, were, burnt, to, deprive, the, japanese, troops, of, materials, with, which, to, make, their, crossing, and, general, gim,

to, be, delayed, for, two, weeks, by, the, imjin, river, the, japanese, sent, a, message, to, the, koreans, on, the, other, bank, requesting, them, to, open, the, way, to, china, but, the, koreans, rejected, this, afterwards, the, japanese, commanders, withdrew, their, main, forces, to, the, safety, of, the, paju, fortress, the, koreans, saw, this, as, a, retreat, and, 13, 000, korean, troops, launched, an, attack, at, dawn, against, the, remaining, japanese, troops, on, the, southern, shore, of, the, imjin, river, the, main, japanese, body, counterattacked, against, the, isolated, korean,

battle, of, cheongju, on, 6, september, 1592, after, the, victory, the, korean, leaders, began, to, quarrel, among, themselves, over, who, was, most, responsible, and, it, was, that, when, the, koreans, took, the, offensive, the, regulars, under, yun, songak, refused, to, take, part, while, the, righteous, army, under, jo, heon, and, the, warrior, monks, under, abbot, yeonggyu, marched,

kobayakawa, at, the, third, battle, of, geumsan, who, likewise, suffered, the, same, fate, total, annihilation, however, as, the, geumsan, salient, had, taken, three, successive, korean, attacks, in, a, row, in, a, single, month, the, 6th, division, under, kobayakawa, was, pulled, back, as, toyotomi, hideyoshi, decided, the, salient, was, not, worth, the, trouble, to, hold, it, and, to, the,

hurled, over, the, walls, of, the, japanese, held, town, of, gyeongju, which, caused, the, robbers, as, korean, accounts, always, called, the, japanese, to, go, examine, it, the, object, turned, out,

was, a, strategic, stronghold, that, defended, gyeongsang, province, the, japanese, commanders, knew, that, control, of, jinju, would, mean, easy, access, to, the, ricebelts, of, jeolla, province, accordingly, a, large, army, under, hosokawa, tadaoki, approached, jinju, jinju, was, defended, by, gim, si, min, one, of, the, better, generals, in, korea, commanding, a, korean, garrison, of, 3, 000, men, gim, had, recently, acquired, about, 170, new, arquebuses, that, were, equal, in, strength, to, the, japanese, guns, as, customary, the, japanese, began, to, collect, heads, with, the, taik, ki, mentioning, how, a, samurai, named, jir, za, emon, took, the, first, head, and, raised, it, aloft, the, other, five, men, also, attacked, and, took, some, excellent, heads, the, japanese, had, usually, had, little, trouble, with, taking, korean, castles, and, towns, and, a, certain, contempt, for, the, fighting, abilities, of, the, koreans, was, common, among, the, samurai, so, it, was, a, great, surprise, for, the, japanese, when, they, assaulted, jinju, to, be, hit, with, a, barrage, of, fire, as, gim, s, men, dropped, heavy, stones, and, bombs, while, firing, their, arquebuses, stopping, their, assault, cold, hosokawa, ordered, a, new, assault, with, the, samurai, advancing, this, time, under, bamboo, shields, with, covering, fire, from, their, arquebuses, which, allowed, them, to, place, ladders, across, the, walls, of, jinju, a, scene, of, carnage, occurred, with, the, koreans, dumping, rocks, and, delayed, action, bombs, down, on, the, japanese, the, taik, ki, reported, as, we, try, to, become, ichiban, nori, they, climbed, up, as, in, a, swarm, because, of, this, the, ladders, almost, broke, and, comrades, fell, down, from, their, climb, so, they, could, not, use, the, ladders, hosokawa, tadaoki, s, brother, sadaoki, was, one, such, accompanied, by, foot, soldiers, on, ladders, on, his, right, and, left, and, strictly, ordered, until, i, have, personally, climbed, into, the, castle, this, ladder, is, for, one, person, to, climb, if, anyone, climbs, i, will, take, his, head, then, he, climbed, because, of, this, the, ladder, did, not, break, and, the, men, who, saw, him, were, loud, in, their, praise, consequently, before, long, he, placed, his, hands, on, the, wall, but, when, he, tried, to, make, his, entry, from, within, the, castle, spears, and, naginata, were, thrust, at, him, to, try, to, make, him, fall, and, lamentably, he, fell, to, the, bottom, of, the, moat, for, three, days, the, japanese, attacked, jinju, fruitlessly, with, the, moats, becoming, full, of, their, dead, on, 11, november, 1592, a, force, of, korean, guerrillas, led, by, gwak, jae, u, arrived, as, the, relief, force, and, to, fool, the, japanese, into, thinking, his, force, was, much, larger, than, it, was, gwak, ordered, his, men, to, light, fires, at, night, on, the, hills, while, blowing, their, conch, shells, on, 12, november, hosokawa, tadaoki, ordered, a, final, attempt, to, storm, jinju, with, heavy, fighting, on, the, northern, gates, with, general, gim, being, killed, when, a, japanese, bullet, went, through, his, head, but, the, korean, arquebus, fire, drove, off, the, japanese, at, that, time, another, korean, relief, force, bringing, badly, needed, ammunition, arrived, up, the, nam, river, causing, hosokawa, to, break, off, the, siege, who, argued, that, with, the, japanese, deep, in, enemy, territory, and, no, reserves, to, cover, his, rear, that, it, was, too, dangerous, to, continue, the, siege, toyotomi, hideyoshi, was, enraged, when, he, heard, of, the, defeat, saying, the, japanese, should, never, be, defeated, by, koreans, and, vowed, vengeance, with, the, help, of, arquebuses, cannon, and, mortars, the, koreans, were, able, to, drive, the, japanese, from, jeolla, province, the, result, of, the, battle, at, jinju, prevented, the, japanese, from, entering, jeolla, province, unable, to, repel, the, japanese, invasion, korea, ultimately, had, to, rely, on, the, intervention, of, ming, china, to, halt, the, japanese, advance, despite, the, various, logistical, and, organizational, difficulties, suffered, by, the, japanese, korean, court, historian, and, politician, ryu, seong, ryong, stated, that, the, korean, naval, victory, stalled, the, entire, strategy, of, the, invaders, by, cutting, off, one, of, the, arms, with, which, japan, tried, to, envelop, korea, isolating, konishi, yukinaga, s, army, at, pyongyang, and, securing, chinese, waters, from, the, feared, japanese, attack, such, that, the, celestial, army, could, come, by, land, to, the, assistance, of, korea, viewing, the, crisis, in, joseon, the, wanli, emperor, and, the, ming, court, were, initially, filled, with, confusion, and, skepticism, as, to, how, their, tributary, could, have, been, overrun, so, quickly, the, korean, court, was, at, first, hesitant, to, call, for, help, from, the, ming, dynasty, and, began, a, withdrawal, to, pyongyang, after, repeated, requests, by, king, seonjo, and, after, the, japanese, army, had, already, reached, korea, s, border, with, china, china, finally, came, to, the, aid, of, korea, china, was, also, somewhat, obligated, to, come, to, the, assistance, of, korea, because, korea, was, a, tributary, state, of, china, and, the, ming, dynasty, did, not, tolerate, the, possibility, of, a, japanese, invasion, of, china, the, local, governor, at, liaodong, eventually, acted, upon, king, seonjo, s, request, for, aid, following, the, capture, of, pyongyang, by, sending, a, small, force, of, 5, 000, soldiers, led, by, zu, chengxun, zu, a, general, who, had, fought, successfully, against, the, mongols, and, the, jurchens, was, over, confident, holding, the, japanese, in, contempt, this, cavalry, force, advanced, almost, unhindered, and, managed, to, enter, pyongyang, but, was, promptly, and, decisively, defeated, by, the, japanese, troops, in, the, city, on, 23, august, 1592, the, chinese, attacked, under, the, cover, of, a, heavy, rainstorm, taking, the, japanese, by, surprise, once, the, japanese, realized, that, they, outnumbered, the, chinese, by, six, to, one, they, allowed, the, chinese, cavalry, to, spread, out, over, the, streets, of, pyongyang, and, counter, attacked, using, their, superior, numbers, to, annihilate, the, chinese, as, the, chinese, retreated, into, the, muddy, fields, outside, of, pyongyang, the, samurai, cut, them, down, in, the, hundreds, one, of, their, leading, generals, shi, ru, was, killed, in, this, engagement, the, japanese, were, elated, at, having, defeated, an, army, from, china, the, foremost, power, in, east, asia, but, konishi, yukinaga, grew, despondent, over, the, fall, of, 1592, as, it, became, clear, that, no, reinforcements, would, arrive, from, japan, the, fleet, of, admiral, yi, sun, sin, was, preventing, any, japanese, ships, from, landing, while, the, attacks, of, the, korean, righteous, army, guerrillas, left, the, japanese, forces, in, northern, korea, largely, cut, off, from, the, forces, in, southern, korea, at, conference, in, hanseong, konishi, told, ukita, hideie, that, he, was, not, certain, if, pyongyang, could, be, held, if, the, chinese, were, to, attack, again, with, greater, numbers, during, the, later, half, of, 1592, the, ming, sent, investigation, teams, into, pyongyang, to, clarify, the, situation, the, ming, became, fully, aware, of, the, situation, and, made, the, decision, for, a, full, reinforcement, by, september, 1592, with, the, victory, in, ningxia, the, chinese, finally, had, the, forces, available, for, korea, and, li, rusong, the, general, who, crushed, the, ningxia, revolt, was, sent, to, expel, the, japanese, from, korea, by, then, it, had, become, clear, that, this, was, a, situation, much, more, serious, than, something, that, could, be, handled, by, local, forces, thus, the, ming, emperor, mobilized, and, dispatched, a, larger, force, in, january, 1593, under, the, general, li, rusong, and, imperial, superintendent, song, yingchang, the, former, being, one, of, the, sons, of, ming, dynasty, s, liaodong, military, magistrate, li, chengliang, and, the, latter, being, a, bureaucratic, officer, ming, military, law, stipulated, that, any, military, officer, would, have, an, accompanying, bureaucrat, appointed, by, the, imperial, court, acting, as, the, general, s, superior, according, to, the, collection, of, letters, left, by, song, yingchang, the, strength, of, the, ming, army, was, around, 40, 000, composed, mostly, of, garrisons, from, the, north, including, around, 3, 000, men, with, experience, against, japanese, pirates, under, qi, jiguang, li, wanted, a, winter, campaign, as, the, frozen, ground, would, allow, his, artillery, train, to, move, more, easily, than, it, would, under, the, roads, turned, into, mud, by, the, fall, rains, on, 5, january, 1593, wu, weizhong, led, an, advance, force, of, 3, 000, men, across, the, yalu, river, into, korea, followed, by, two, battalions, of, 2, 000, men, each, later, the, same, day, at, uiju, king, seonjo, and, the, korean, court, formally, welcomed, li, and, the, other, chinese, generals, to, korea, where, strategy, was, discussed, thailand, a, longtime, faithful, tributary, state, of, the, chinese, dynasties, offered, to, directly, attack, japan, to, intervene, in, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, plans, but, ming, did, not, accept, instead, ordering, thailand, to, attack, burma, on, february, 5, 1593, the, ming, expeditionary, army, arrived, outside, pyongyang, accompanied, by, a, group, of, korean, soldiers, ming, general, li, rusong, was, appointed, the, supreme, commander, of, all, armies, in, korea, after, initial, attempts, to, negotiate, with, the, japanese, defenders, under, konishi, yukinaga, broke, down, the, two, sides, began, skirmishing, on, the, outskirts, over, the, next, couple, of, days, with, li, rusong, attempting, to, dislodge, a, japanese, garrison, on, the, hills, north, of, the, city, while, konishi, yukinaga, attempted, a, night, raid, on, the, ming, camp, the, japanese, night, attack, was, beaten, off, by, the, chinese, fire, archers, and, li, ordered, a, feigned, retreat, leading, the, over, confident, samurai, to, fall, into, a, trap, resulting, in, their, annihilation, the, sino, korean, force, consisted, of, 43, 000, chinese, 10, 000, koreans, plus, righteous, army, guerrillas, and, about, 5, 000, warrior, monks, li, admitted, that, the, japanese, infantry, were, better, equipped, with, guns, but, assured, his, officers, japanese, weapons, have, a, range, of, a, few, hundred, paces, while, my, great, cannon, have, a, range, of, five, to, six, li, how, can, we, not, be, victorious, the, city, of, pyongyang, was, one, of, the, most, powerful, fortresses, in, korea, and, to, take, it, li, s, plans, called, for, surrounding, the, city, on, all, four, sides, starting, a, fierce, bombardment, under, which, his, infantry, would, advance, the, korean, warrior, monks, led, by, abbot, hyujeong, attacked, the, headquarters, of, konishi, yuninaga, on, moranbong, coming, under, heavy, japanese, arquebus, fire, taking, hundreds, of, dead, but, they, persevered, later, that, same, day, the, chinese, under, wu, weizhong, joined, the, attack, and, with, a, real, danger, that, konishi, would, be, cut, off, from, the, rest, of, his, army, so, yoshitoshi, led, a, counterattack, that, rescued, the, japanese, forces, from, moranbong, after, the, fall, of, moranbong, after, two, days, fighting, li, rusong, ordered, his, cannons, to, open, fire, while, fire, arrows, and, incendiary, bombs, set, much, of, the, city, on, fire, on, the, morning, of, february, 6, li, ordered, an, all, out, assault, on, three, sides, of, the, city, the, chinese, took, heavy, losses, as, the, japanese, fire, was, withering, but, li, whose, horse, was, killed, was, able, to, bring, up, the, siege, ladders, called, cloud, ladders, by, the, chinese, li, had, offered, 5, 000, ounces, of, silver, for, the, first, man, to, get, over, the, wall, an, honor, that, was, claimed, by, an, infantryman, from, zhejiang, province, named, luo, shangzhi, who, got, up, unto, the, wall, while, using, his, halberd, to, great, effect, japanese, defenders, were, forced, off, the, walls, fairly, quickly, and, retreated, to, the, citadel, they, built, on, the, eastern, portions, of, the, city, chinese, officers, initially, scoffed, at, the, earth, walls, of, the, japanese, citadel, but, after, coming, under, fire, from, the, japanese, arquebuses, soon, learned, to, respect, the, defense, the, jingbirok, reported, the, enemy, built, clay, walls, with, holes, on, top, of, their, fortress, which, looked, like, a, beehive, they, fired, their, muskets, though, those, holes, as, much, as, they, could, and, as, a, result, a, number, of, chinese, soldiers, were, wounded, the, allies, were, unwilling, to, commit, to, a, direct, assault, on, the, heavily, defended, fortification, during, the, day, instead, they, left, an, opening, for, the, japanese, to, rally, while, making, preparations, for, a, fire, assault, on, their, position, at, night, japanese, forces, sallied, out, of, the, undefended, eastern, walls, and, made, a, run, for, hanseong, and, they, were, hit, with, additional, ambushes, on, the, way, back, south, and, took, heavy, casualties, a, samurai, yoshino, jingoze, emon, wrote, about, the, retreat, there, was, hardly, a, gap, between, the, dead, bodies, that, filled, the, surroundings, of, matsuyama, castle, finally, when, we, had, repulsed, the, enemy, they, burned, the, food, storehouses, in, several, places, so, there, was, now, no, food, on, the, night, of, the, seventh, day, we, evacuated, the, caste, and, made, our, escape, wounded, men, were, abandoned, while, those, who, were, not, wounded, but, simply, exhausted, crawled, almost, prostrate, along, the, road, because, it, is, a, cold, country, there, is, ice, and, deep, snow, and, hands, and, feet, are, burned, by, the, snow, and, this, gives, rise, to, frostbite, which, makes, them, swell, up, the, only, clothes, they, had, were, the, garments, worn, under, their, armour, and, even, men, who, were, normally, gallant, resembled, scarecrows, on, the, mountains, and, fields, because, of, their, fatigue, and, were, indistinguishable, from, the, dead, the, fortress, of, pungsan, held, by, otomo, yoshimune, of, the, third, division, had, been, abandoned, and, burned, down, by, him, before, konishi, s, force, reached, it, adding, to, the, misery, of, the, retreat, otomo, ruined, his, reputation, by, retreating, without, being, attacked, and, as, a, result, the, otomo, clan, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, respected, daimy, families, on, kyushu, were, disgraced, forever, as, under, bushido, cowardice, was, the, worst, disgrace, for, a, samurai, otomo, s, disgrace, was, also, a, blow, for, the, efforts, of, jesuit, missionaries, in, japan, as, otomo, had, converted, to, catholicism, after, long, talks, with, the, portuguese, jesuits, and, many, japanese, concluded, that, christianity, with, its, emphasis, on, love, and, gentleness, was, not, a, suitable, religion, for, a, samurai, song, yingchang, s, letters, on, march, 1, 1593, described, the, battle, in, full, to, the, ming, court, after, their, defeat, the, japanese, shifted, their, strategy, to, hit, and, run, tactics, and, ambushes, the, use, of, gunpowder, technology, and, street, fighting, contributed, to, the, victory, which, would, permanently, deter, the, invasion, soon, after, retaking, pyongyang, li, rusong, also, succeeded, in, retaking, the, major, city, of, kaesong, on, january, 19, 1592, and, met, only, minor, resistance, from, the, japanese, defenders, overconfident, with, his, recent, success, and, possibly, misled, by, false, reports, li, rusong, advanced, towards, the, capital, city, of, hanseong, with, his, allied, army, of, 20, 000, on, january, 21, 1593, on, january, 26, the, force, ran, into, an, unexpected, confrontation, at, byeokjegwan, with, a, large, japanese, formation, of, about, 30, 000, initially, the, scouting, party, of, the, group, under, cha, da, sho, and, a, korean, general, confronted, a, small, band, of, japanese, numbering, no, more, than, 600, men, the, party, overran, them, successfully, but, soon, ran, into, a, much, larger, host, under, tachibana, muneshige, and, retreated, to, a, nearby, hill, to, defend, themselves, upon, hearing, of, his, scouting, party, s, plight, li, decided, to, rush, forward, with, the, rest, of, his, small, host, he, met, up, with, his, scouting, party, around, noon, but, by, that, time, even, more, japanese, forces, were, converging, on, the, area, the, ming, forces, gradually, retreated, north, while, fighting, off, several, waves, of, attacks, li, rusong, and, many, other, generals, personally, fought, in, the, brawl, and, they, sustained, heavy, casualties, before, they, met, up, with, the, rest, of, their, army, toward, the, later, portion, of, the, day, at, that, point, the, japanese, gave, up, further, attacks, and, both, sides, pulled, back, because, the, ming, suffered, heavy, casualties, among, their, elite, retinues, li, became, reluctant, to, move, aggressively, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, the, japanese, invasion, into, jeolla, province, was, broken, down, and, pushed, back, by, general, gwon, yul, at, the, hills, of,

swung, north, toward, haengju, fortress, a, wooden, stockade, on, a, cliff, over, the, han, river, where, he, would, wait, for, chinese, reinforcements, after, he, was, informed, that, the, ming, army, under, li, rusong, was, pushed, back, at, byeokje, gwon, yul, decided, to, fortify, haengju, kwon, s, force, of, 2, 300, men, were, a, mixture, of, regulars, warrior, monks, and, righteous,

an, impressive, mountain, fortress, that, overlooked, the, surrounding, area, an, army, of, a, few, thousand, led, by, gwon, yul, was, garrisoned, at, the, fortress, waiting, for, the, japanese, kat, believed, his, overwhelming, army, would, destroy, the, koreans, and, therefore, ordered, the, japanese, soldiers, to, simply, advance, upon, the, steep, slopes, of, haengju, with, little, planning, at, about, 6, am, gwon, yul, responded, to, the, japanese, advance, with, fierce, fire, from, the, fortification, using, hwachas, rocks, handguns, and, bows, the, hwach, a, fire, wagon, was, a, cart, that, could, fire, either, 100, rockets, or, 200, arrows, at, once, the, hwach, a, took, much, time, to, load, but, were, capable, of, bringing, down, deadly, fire, gwon, had, trained, his, men, to, fire, their, hwach, as, all, at, once, and, as, the, japanese, were, packed, closely, together, the, volley, from, the, fire, wagons, inflicted, heavy, losses, the, women, of, hanseong, joined, their, menfolk, bringing, up, rocks, in, their, skirts, in, the, course, of, nine, assaults, the, japanese, pushed, the, koreans, back, to, their, second, line, but, could, advance, no, further, losing, about, 10, 000, dead, in, the, process, how, could, you, possibly, die, 10000, this, is, a, fabrication, used, by, future, generations, to, commemorate, this, battle, according, to, contemporary, korean, records, the, korean, army, harvested, 130, japanese, heads, and, the, koreans, estimated, that, they, killed, five, to, six, japanese, soldiers, the, jingbirok, wrote, gwon, yul, ordered, his, soldiers, to, gather, the, dead, bodies, of, the, enemy, and, vent, their, anger, by, tearing, them, apart, and, hanging, them, on, the, branches, of, the, trees, facing, unexpected, resistance, and, mounting, casualties, kat, kiyomasa, burned, his, dead, and, finally, pulled, his, troops, back, the, battle, of, haengju, was, an, important, victory, for, the, koreans, as, it, greatly, improved, the, morale, of, the, korean, army, the, battle, is, celebrated, today, as, one, of, the, three, most, decisive, korean, victories, the, other, two, being, the, 1592, battle, of, hansan, island, and, the, siege, of, jinju, today, the, site, of, haengju, fortress, has, a, memorial, built, to, honor, gwon, yul, by, this, time, the, japanese, invasion, force, of, about, 150, 000, men, were, down, to, about, 100, 000, men, with, chinese, reinforcements, arriving, every, day, most, of, the, japanese, were, suffering, from, hunger, frostbite, and, snow, blindness, and, some, japanese, soldiers, were, so, weakened, by, hunger, that, they, were, unable, to, defend, themselves, from, tigers, in, the, mountains, with, the, situation, untenable, the, japanese, retreated, to, the, coast, after, the, battle, of, byeokjegwan, the, ming, army, took, a, cautious, approach, and, moved, on, hanseong, again, later, in, february, after, the, successful, korean, defense, in, the, battle, of, haengju, the, two, sides, remained, at, a, stalemate, between, the, kaesong, to, hanseong, line, for, the, next, couple, of, months, with, both, sides, unable, and, unwilling, to, commit, to, further, offensives, the, japanese, lacked, sufficient, supplies, to, move, north, and, the, defeat, at, pyongyang, had, caused, part, of, the, japanese, leadership, such, as, konishi, yukinaga, and, ishida, mitsunari, to, seriously, consider, negotiating, with, the, ming, dynasty, forces, this, got, them, into, a, heated, debate, with, other, hawkish, generals, such, as, kat, kiyomasa, and, these, conflicts, would, eventually, have, further, implications, following, the, war, in, japan, when, the, two, sides, became, rivals, in, the, battle, of, sekigahara, the, ming, forces, had, their, own, set, of, problems, soon, after, arriving, in, korea, the, ming, officials, began, to, note, the, inadequate, logistical, supply, from, the, korean, court, the, records, by, qian, shizhen, noted, that, even, after, the, siege, of, pyongyang, the, ming, forces, were, already, stalled, for, nearly, a, week, due, to, the, lack, of, supplies, before, moving, on, to, kaesong, as, time, went, on, the, situation, only, become, more, serious, when, the, weather, warmed, the, road, conditions, in, korea, also, became, terrible, as, numerous, letters, from, song, yingchang, and, other, ming, officers, attest, which, made, resupplying, from, china, itself, also, a, tedious, process, the, korean, countryside, was, already, devastated, from, the, invasion, when, the, ming, forces, arrived, and, in, the, heart, of, winter, it, was, extremely, difficult, for, the, koreans, to, muster, sufficient, supplies, even, though, the, court, had, assigned, the, majority, of, the, men, on, hand, to, tackle, the, situation, their, desire, to, reclaim, their, country, along, with, the, militarily, inexperienced, nature, of, many, of, their, administrators, resulted, in, their, continual, requests, to, the, ming, forces, to, advance, despite, the, situation, these, events, created, an, increasing, level, of, distrust, between, the, two, sides, though, by, mid, april, 1593, faced, with, ever, greater, logistical, pressure, from, a, korean, naval, blockade, of, yi, sun, sin, in, addition, to, a, ming, force, special, operation, that, managed, to, burn, down, a, very, significant, portion, of, the, japanese, grain, storage, the, japanese, broke, off, talks, and, pulled, out, of, hanseong, unlike, the, first, siege, of, jinju, the, second, siege, resulted, in, a, japanese, victory, toyotomi, hideyoshi, was, especially, determined, to, take, jinju, and, ordered, that, the, previous, japanese, failure, to, take, the, city, be, avenged, ukita, hideie, led, 90, 000, japanese, troops, to, take, jinju, making, it, the, largest, mobilization, of, japanese, forces, for, a, single, operation, in, the, entire, war, the, koreans, not, knowing, where, the, japanese, were, going, divided, their, forces, with, kim, cheon, il, commanding, the, garrison, of, 4, 000, soldiers, at, jinju, who, were, joined, by, volunteers, guerrillas, a, small, chinese, force, and, a, large, number, of, civilians, including, women, and, children, making, for, a, total, of, about, 60, 000, on, 20, july, 1593, the, japanese, began, to, construct, wooden, shields, to, allow, them, to, advance, against, the, walls, to, the, west, were, konishi, yukinaga, with, 26, 000, men, and, to, the, north, were, kato, kiyomasa, with, 25, 000, while, ukita, hideie, commanded, the, reserve, of, 17, 000, on, 21, july, 1593, the, japanese, attacked, breaking, the, dyke, that, filled, the, moat, around, jinju, while, the, samurai, advanced, under, their, wooden, shields, to, be, stopped, by, korean, fire, arrows, cannonballs, and, arquebuses, on, 23, july, the, japanese, attacked, with, wooden, siege, towers, which, were, knocked, down, by, korean, cannon, fire, on, 25, july, under, a, flag, of, truce, ukita, sent, a, messenger, to, kim, telling, him, that, the, japanese, would, slaughter, 10, 000, korean, peasants, whom, they, had, taken, prisoner, if, jinju, did, not, surrender, at, once, but, kim, refused, and, so, 10, 000, korean, peasants, were, beheaded, the, japanese, now, attacked, with, armored, carts, called, tortoise, shell, wagons, which, allowed, the, japanese, to, advance, up, to, the, walls, where, the, sappers, would, pull, out, the, stones, but, as, a, japanese, account, complained, they, tried, to, attack, but, from, inside, the, castle, pine, torches, were, thrown, that, set, the, grass, alight, the, soldiers, inside, the, tortoise, wagons, were, also, burned, and, retreated, on, 27, july, the, japanese, again, attacked, with, the, tortoise, shell, wagons, but, this, time, there, was, a, heavy, thunderstorm, that, prevented, korean, attempts, to, incinerate, the, japanese, by, dropping, torches, soaked, in, fat, the, japanese, sappers, broke, down, a, section, of, the, wall, and, a, great, rush, broke, out, with, the, samurai, pushed, each, other, down, as, it, was, a, great, honor, to, be, the, first, samurai, to, enter, a, fortress, goto, mototsugu, a, retainer, of, kuroda, nagamasa, was, about, to, be, the, first, samurai, to, enter, jinju, when, iida, kakbei, a, retainer, of, kato, kiyomasa, threw, the, nichiren, flag, into, the, breach, to, claim, that, honor, for, himself, the, korean, garrison, was, out, of, ammunition, and, were, short, of, swords, so, many, koreans, fought, with, wooden, sticks, against, the, onrush, of, samurai, armed, with, katanas, one, korean, general, s, yewon, engaged, in, a, lengthy, single, combat, with, a, samurai, named, okamoto, gonjo, which, ended, when, the, wounded, general, s, lost, his, breath, and, fell, down, by, a, tree, and, okamoto, took, the, chance, to, sever, his, head, with, a, single, blow, from, his, katana, s, s, head, fell, down, by, the, nam, river, which, as, it, was, a, great, honor, for, a, samurai, to, take, the, head, of, their, enemies, led, okamoto, to, order, a, search, to, find, s, s, head, so, that, it, could, be, salted, and, taken, back, to, japan, the, korean, commander, general, kim, cheon, il, committed, suicide, as, usual, the, japanese, took, no, prisoners, killing, almost, everyone, both, military, and, civilian, and, the, nam, river, ran, red, with, blood, as, thousands, attempted, to, swim, across, it, only, to, be, cut, down, by, the, samurai, waiting, on, the, other, side, the, chronicler, of, the, kato, clan, noted, all, the, chinese, were, terrified, of, our, japanese, blades, and, jumped, into, the, river, but, we, pulled, them, and, cut, off, their, heads, korean, accounts, mention, that, almost, all, of, the, 60, 000, soldiers, in, jinju, were, killed, while, japanese, accounts, mention, the, samurai, sent, 20, 000, heads, back, to, japan, after, their, victory, only, the, kisaeng, courtesans, of, jinju, were, spared, as, they, were, pressed, into, service, for, the, victorious, japanese, generals, at, a, party, they, held, to, celebrate, their, victory, on, the, evening, of, the, same, day, at, the, ch, oks, ngu, pavilion, on, a, nearby, hill, as, it, offered, the, best, view, of, the, hellish, scene, below, them, one, courtesan, nongae, attracted, the, attention, of, a, samurai, keyamura, rokunosuke, whom, she, lured, to, a, cliff, by, promising, him, sex, and, then, threw, both, herself, and, him, off, the, cliff, becoming, a, national, heroine, in, korea, jinju, was, taken, only, for, symbolic, purposes, and, instead, of, advancing, the, japanese, force, at, jinju, retreated, back, to, busan, as, there, was, a, larger, chinese, force, to, the, north, toyotomi, hideyoshi, was, well, satisfied, that, he, had, avenged, the, defeat, of, 1592, at, jinju, though, turnbull, argued, that, to, lose, so, many, men, to, take, a, town, only, for, symbolic, reasons, was, wasteful, there, were, two, factors, that, triggered, the, japanese, to, withdraw, first, a, chinese, commando, penetrated, hanseong, present, day, seoul, and, burned, storehouses, at, yongsan, destroying, most, of, what, was, left, of, the, japanese, troops, depleted, stock, of, food, secondly, shen, weijing, made, another, appearance, to, conduct, negotiations, and, threatened, the, japanese, with, an, attack, by, 400, 000, chinese, the, japanese, under, konishi, yukinaga, and, kat, kiyomasa, aware, of, their, weak, situation, agreed, to, withdraw, to, the, busan, area, while, the, chinese, would, withdraw, back, to, china, a, ceasefire, was, imposed, and, a, ming, emissary, was, sent, to, japan, to, discuss, peace, terms, for, the, next, three, years, there, was, little, fighting, as, the, japanese, retained, control, of, a, few, coastal, fortresses, with, the, rest, of, korea, being, controlled, by, the, koreans, by, may, 18, 1594, all, the, japanese, soldiers, had, retreated, to, the, area, around, busan, and, many, began, to, make, their, way, back, to, japan, the, ming, government, withdrew, most, of, its, expeditionary, force, but, kept, 16, 000, men, on, the, korean, peninsula, to, guard, the, truce, once, peace, negotiations, between, china, and, japan, finally, got, underway, chinese, negotiators, gave, the, ming, emperor, the, mistaken, impression, that, he, was, about, to, deal, with, a, minor, state, that, had, been, subdued, by, war, furthermore, they, conveyed, the, idea, that, the, japanese, regent, toyotomi, hideyoshi, was, prepared, to, become, his, vassal, under, such, conditions, the, chinese, sought, to, resolve, the, issue, in, their, favor, by, including, japan, in, their, tributary, system, of, foreign, relations, they, would, establish, hideyoshi, as, king, of, japan, and, grant, him, the, privilege, of, formal, tribute, trade, relations, with, the, ming, dynasty, in, japan, hideyoshi, s, negotiators, apparently, led, him, to, believe, that, china, was, suing, for, peace, and, was, ready, to, accept, him, as, their, emperor, thus, hideyoshi, issued, the, demands, of, a, victor, first, a, daughter, of, the, ming, emperor, must, be, sent, to, become, the, wife, of, the, japanese, emperor, second, the, southern, provinces, of, joseon, must, be, ceded, to, japan, third, normal, trade, relations, between, china, and, japan, must, be, restored, and, fourth, a, joseon, prince, and, several, high, ranking, government, officials, must, be, sent, to, japan, as, hostages, bargaining, from, such, fundamentally, different, perspectives, there, was, no, prospect, whatsoever, for, success, in, the, talks, early, in, 1597, both, sides, resumed, hostilities, after, the, failed, peace, negotiations, of, the, inter, war, years, toyotomi, hideyoshi, launched, the, second, invasion, of, korea, one, of, the, main, strategic, differences, between, the, first, and, second, invasions, was, that, conquering, china, was, no, longer, an, explicit, goal, for, the, japanese, failing, to, gain, a, foothold, during, kat, kiyomasa, s, chinese, campaign, and, the, near, complete, withdrawal, of, the, japanese, forces, during, the, first, invasion, had, established, that, the, korean, peninsula, was, the, more, prudent, and, realistic, objective, japan, s, second, force, arrived, unopposed, on, the, southern, coast, of, gyeongsang, province, in, 1596, soon, after, the, chinese, ambassadors, had, safely, returned, to, china, in, 1597, hideyoshi, sent, approximately, 200, ships, with, an, estimated, 141, 100, men, under, the, overall, command, of, kobayakawa, hideaki, however, the, japanese, found, that, the, korean, army, was, both, better, equipped, and, better, prepared, to, deal, with, an, invasion, than, several, years, prior, in, addition, upon, hearing, the, news, in, china, the, imperial, court, in, beijing, appointed, yang, hao, as, the, supreme, commander, of, an, initial, mobilization, of, 55, 000, troops, from, various, and, sometimes, remote, provinces, across, china, such, as, sichuan, zhejiang, huguang, fujian, and, guangdong, a, naval, force, of, 21, 000, was, included, in, the, effort, ray, huang, a, chinese, american, philosopher, and, historian, estimated, that, the, combined, strength, of, the, chinese, army, and, navy, at, the, height, of, the, second, campaign, was, around, 75, 000, korean, forces, totaled, approximately, 30, 000, men, with, general, gwon, yul, s, army, in, gong, mountain, in, daegu, general, gwon, eung, s, troops, in, gyeongju, general, gwak, jae, u, s, soldiers, in, changnyeong, yi, bok, nam, s, army, in, naju, and, yi, si, yun, s, troops, in, chungpungnyeong, initially, the, japanese, found, limited, success, being, largely, confined, to, gyeongsang, province, and, only, launching, numerous, raids, to, harass, and, weaken, the, korean, defenders, in, the, early, autumn, of, 1597, the, japanese, began, a, more, focused, and, sustained, advance, the, japanese, planned, to, attack, jeolla, province, in, the, southwestern, part, of, the, peninsula, and, eventually, occupy, jeonju, the, provincial, capital, korean, success, in, the, first, siege, of, jinju, in, 1592, had, mostly, saved, this, area, from, devastation, during, the, first, invasion, the, second, siege, of, jinju, in, 1593, while, a, japanese, victory, was, only, undertaken, for, symbolic, purposes, two, japanese, armies, under, m, ri, hidemoto, and, ukita, hideie, began, the, assault, in, busan, and, marched, towards, jeonju, taking, sacheon, and, changpyeong, along, the, way, the, korean, navy, was, again, to, play, a, crucial, part, in, the, second, invasion, as, in, the, first, by, hampering, japanese, advances, on, land, by, harassing, supply, fleets, at, sea, however, despite, his, previous, successes, yi, sun, sin, was, both, demoted, and, jailed, by, king, seonjo, largely, due, to, a, japanese, plot, to, deceive, the, korean, court, and, take, advantage, of, the, court, s, political, infighting, government, officials, gave, direct, orders, to, launch, a, surprise, naval, operation, against, the, japanese, based, on, a, tip, from, a, presumed, reliable, japanese, spy, yi, refused, to, obey, these, orders, knowing, that, this, was, an, obvious, trap, meant, to, have, his, own, fleet, sail, into, an, ambush, this, development, allowed, others, within, the, court, to, further, advance, their, personal, agendas, while, yi, was, severely, punished, ultimately, won, gyun, was, appointed, in, yi, sun, sin, s, place, at, the, head, of, the, korean, navy, after, won, gyun, replaced, yi, sun, sin, as, head, of, the, korean, navy, he, was, quick, to, take, action, and, justify, his, newly, acquired, position, he, gathered, the, entire, korean, fleet, which, now, had, more, than, 100, ships, outside, of, yeosu, to, search, for, the, japanese, without, any, previous, preparations, or, planning, won, gyun, then, had, his, entire, fleet, sail, towards, busan, after, one, day, at, sea, won, gyun, was, informed, of, a, large, japanese, fleet, near, busan, he, decided, to, attack, immediately, despite, reports, of, exhaustion, among, the, crews, of, his, ships, at, the, subsequent, battle, of, chilcheollyang, won, gyun, was, completely, outmaneuvered, by, the, japanese, in, a, surprise, attack, his, ships, were, overwhelmed, by, arquebus, fire, and, the, traditional, japanese, boarding, attacks, which, largely, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, his, entire, fleet, prior, to, this, engagement, bae, seol, 1551, 1599, a, naval, officer, who, did, not, submit, to, won, gyun, s, leadership, kept, thirteen, panokseons, under, his, command, and, out, of, the, battle, instead, escaping, to, the, southwestern, korean, coast, these, would, form, the, entire, fighting, force, of, the, korean, navy, during, the, following, months, the, battle, of, chilcheollyang, was, japan, s, only, decisive, naval, victory, of, the, war, won, gyun, was, himself, killed, by, a, japanese, garrison, after, he, struggled, ashore, on, an, island, following, the, destruction, of, his, flagship, the, victory, allowed, the, japanese, navy, to, safely, escort, its, troop, ships, and, to, support, planned, landing, operations, after, the, disaster, at, chilcheollyang, the, allied, defenses, in, the, south, began, to, quickly, break, down, and, the, japanese, forces, stormed, into, jeolla, province, the, garrison, of, namwon, became, their, next, key, target, namwon, was, located, 50, kilometres, southeast, of, jeonju, correctly, predicting, a, japanese, attack, a, coalition, force, of, 6, 000, soldiers, including, 3, 000, chinese, troops, under, yang, yuan, and, civilian, volunteers, were, prepared, to, fight, the, approaching, japanese, forces, the, japanese, laid, siege, to, the, walls, of, the, fortress, with, ladders, and, siege, towers, the, two, sides, exchanged, volleys, with, arquebuses, and, bows, eventually, the, japanese, forces, scaled, the, walls, and, sacked, the, fortress, according, to, japanese, commander, okochi, hidemoto, author, of, the, chosen, ki, korean, record, the, siege, of, namwon, resulted, in, 3, 726, casualties, among, the, korean, and, chinese, forces, the, korean, forces, and, its, leaders, were, almost, entirely, killed, when, the, gates, were, opened, many, koreans, simply, laid, down, on, their, knees, knowing, the, samurai, would, behead, them, while, others, tried, to, flee, north, where, the, samurai, commanded, by, kat, yoshiaki, and, shimazu, yoshihiro, were, waiting, and, proceeded, to, cut, down, all, koreans, with, their, katanas, the, japanese, buddhist, monk, keinen, who, was, traveling, with, the, samurai, described, a, scene, of, utter, horror, as, the, full, moon, illuminated, the, scenes, of, destruction, with, much, of, the, town, on, fire, the, formerly, white, walls, of, namwon, turned, red, with, blood, and, the, wailing, of, the, koreans, knowing, it, was, their, time, to, die, as, the, samurai, gave, no, mercy, killing, all, only, yang, yuan, managed, to, sally, out, after, the, walls, were, breached, with, a, handful, of, men, to, return, to, hanseong, he, was, later, executed, by, the, ming, court, because, of, his, defeat, in, battle, traditionally, samurai, collected, the, heads, of, those, they, killed, and, toyotomi, hideyoshi, had, insisted, that, the, samurai, send, him, the, noses, of, those, they, had, killed, as, proof, that, they, were, fighting, okochi, counted, the, heads, of, 3, 725, koreans, killed, that, day, and, removed, their, noses, which, were, pickled, in, salt, and, sent, back, to, japan, all, of, the, noses, of, the, koreans, killed, by, the, samurai, are, buried, near, the, shrine, to, the, great, buddha, put, up, by, hideyoshi, in, kyoto, which, as, turnbull, noted, they, remain, to, this, day, inside, kyoto, s, least, mentioned, and, most, often, avoided, tourist, attraction, the, grassy, burial, mound, that, bears, the, erroneous, name, of, the, mimizuka, the, mound, of, ears, hwangseoksan, fortress,

siege, to, the, mountain, with, the, army, of, the, right, and, attacked, at, night, under, the, full, moon, the, koreans, lost, morale, and, retreated, with, 350, casualties, the, successful, siege, did, not, however, lead, to, a, subsequent, advance, from, beyond, gyeongsang, province, upon, the, start, of, the, second, invasion, the, ming, emperor, was, furious, about, the, entire, debacle, of, the, peace, talks, and, turned, his, wrath, on, many, of, its, chief, supporters, particularly, shi, xing, the, minister, of, war, who, was, removed, from, his, position, and, jailed, he, died, several, years, later, in, prison, the, chief, negotiator, shen, weijing, was, executed, xing, jie, the, chief, commissioner, of, the, liaodong, commandery, was, named, the, new, minister, of, war, and, yang, hao, as, the, new, chief, superintendent, of, korea, xing, jie, himself, was, also, stationed, in, korea, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, the, ming, leadership, quickly, pulled, in, many, units, stationed, near, its, border, with, korea, after, the, steady, advances, on, land, the, japanese, planned, to, assault, hanseong, by, late, august, or, early, september, 1597, however, the, plans, were, foiled, by, a, ming, defense, around, jiksan, modern, day, cheonan, forces, under, kuroda, nagamasa, formed, the, vanguard, of, the, right, army, and, marched, toward, hanseong, which, deeply, disturbed, the, court, there, several, of, the, ming, generals, stationed, in, korea, suggested, to, the, court, that, they, pull, back, their, forces, until, they, could, gather, more,

where, 6, 000, ming, soldiers, were, stationed, kuroda, s, forces, charged, the, enemies, and, was, soon, joined, by, the, rest, of, the, army, bringing, japanese, forces, to, 30, 000, although, heavily, outnumbering, the, ming, the, japanese, were, unable, to, do, much, damage, due, to, the, ming, s, superior, armor, according, to, kuroda, and, m, ri, hidemoto, their, firearms, could, not, penetrate, the, iron, shields, used, by, chinese, soldiers, and, their, armor, was, at, least, partially, bulletproof, the, battle, continued, until, dusk, when, the, two, sides, withdrew, kuroda, launched, another, attack, at, night, this, time, in, a, pronged, sweeping, crane, formation, that, sought, to, crush, the, enemies, between, them, the, attack, failed, and, turned, into, a, rout, that, was, joined, by, 2, 000, ming, cavalry, jiksan, was, the, furthest, the, japanese, ever, got, towards, reaching, hanseong, seoul, during, the, second, invasion, after, the, debacle, in, chilcheollyang, king, seonjo, immediately, reinstated, yi, sun, sin, yi, sun, sin, quickly, returned, to, yeosu, where, he, found, the, majority, of, his, navy, destroyed, yi, re, organized, the,

encountered, a, large, japanese, fleet, of, approximately, 133, warships, with, a, further, 200, logistical, ships, in, support, by, making, use, of, a, narrow, passage, yi, positioned, his, ships, in, a, battle, line, that, prevented, the, japanese, navy, from, making, use, of, their, numerical, superiority, the, battle, of, myeongnyang, resulted, in, a, korean, victory, with, yi, sun, sin, retaking, the, naval, initiative, the, koreans, did, not, lose, a, single, ship, and, destroyed, approximately, 30, japanese, combat, ships, severely, damaging, another, 30, the, oft, cited, number, of, 333, ships, in, the, japanese, fleet, includes, support, ships, which, would, not, be, considered, combat, ships, the, battle, of, myeongnyang, is, considered, yi, sun, sin, s, greatest, battle, largely, as, a, result, of, the, disparity, of, numbers, even, after, the, victory, however, the, joseon, navy, was, still, outnumbered, by, the, remaining, japanese, navy, so, admiral, yi, withdrew, to, the, yellow, sea, to, resupply, his, fleet, and, have, more, space, for, a, mobile, defense, after, the, korean, navy, withdrew, the, japanese, navy, made, an, incursion, into, the, western, coast, of, korea, near, some, islands, in, yeonggwang, county, by, january, 29, 1598, the, joseon, and, ming, allied, forces, achieved, victory, in, jiksan, and, pushed, the, japanese, further, south, after, the, news, of, the, loss, at, myeongnyang, kat, kiyomasa, and, his, retreating, army, looted, gyeongju, the, former, capital, of, unified, silla, the, japanese, forces, sacked, the, city, and, many, artifacts, and, temples, were, destroyed, most, prominently, the, bulguksa, a, buddhist, temple, ming, and, joseon, forces, continued, to, harass, the, japanese, forces, who, then, withdrew, further, south, to, ulsan, a, harbor, that, had, been, an, important, japanese, trading, post, a, century, before, and, which, kat, had, chosen, as, a, strategic, stronghold, yi, sun, sin, s, control, of, the, areas, around, the, coast, of, jeolla, permitted, no, supply, ships, to, reach, the, western, side, of, the, korean, peninsula, into, which, many, extensive, tributaries, merge, without, provisions, and, reinforcements, the, japanese, forces, were, constrained, to, the, coastal, fortresses, known, as, waj, that, they, still, controlled, the, advancing, ming, forces, attempted, to, take, advantage, of, this, situation, by, attacking, ulsan, this, siege, was, the, first, major, offensive, from, the, ming, forces, in, the, second, phase, of, the, war, the, effort, of, the, japanese, garrison, about, 7, 000, men, of, ulsan, was, largely, dedicated, to, its, fortification, in, preparation, for, the, expected, attack, kat, kiyomasa, assigned, command, and, defense, of, the, base, to, kat, yasumasa, kuki, hirotaka, asano, nagayoshi, and, others, before, proceeding, to, sosaengpo, near, ulsan, the, ming, army, s, first, assault, on, january, 29, 1598, caught, the, japanese, army, unaware, and, still, encamped, for, the, large, part, outside, ulsan, s, unfinished, walls, a, total, of, around, 36, 000, troops, with, the, help, of, singijeons, and, hwachas, nearly, succeeded, in, sacking, the, fortress, but, reinforcements, under, the, overall, command, of, m, ri, hidemoto, came, across, the, river, to, aid, the, besieged, fortress, although, the, japanese, garrison, was, desperately, short, of, supplies, the, ming, commander, ma, gui, judged, the, situation, to, be, going, against, the, allies, because, more, and, more, japanese, forces, began, to, arrive, from, the, surrounding, area, and, the, allied, forces, were, quickly, becoming, outnumbered, late, one, night, ma, gui, decided, to, order, a, general, organized, retreat, of, the, allied, forces, but, soon, confusion, set, in, and, matters, were, further, complicated, by, heavy, rainfall, and, harassing, attacks, by, the, japanese, the, chief, superintendent, yang, hao, panicked, and, left, hastily, for, hanseong, ahead, of, the, army, the, general, retreat, quickly, turned, into, a, chaotic, rout, of, which, the, japanese, took, quick, advantage, by, attacking, the, retreating, ming, and, joseon, forces, the, retreating, ming, and, joseon, forces, had, 20, 000, losses, the, second, army, actually, lost, 1621, soldiers, in, action, but, due, to, internal, strife, there, was, a, rumor, that, 20000, soldiers, died, in, the, second, army, the, disaster, was, a, heavy, setback, for, joseon, who, would, not, be, in, a, position, to, move, on, the, japanese, position, again, for, more, than, eight, months, after, the, siege, at, ulsan, the, two, sides, remained, in, a, stalemate, for, the, next, several, months, xing, jie, decided, that, they, would, require, further, reinforcements, to, launch, a, final, large, offensive, to, permanently, remove, the, japanese, presence, on, the, korean, peninsula, reinforcements, from, china, began, to, pour, in, through, most, of, mid, 1598, with, chen, lin, and, deng, zilong, and, their, navy, arriving, in, may, by, september, 1598, the, ming, presence, in, korea, had, swelled, to, 75, 000, overall, by, far, the, largest, at, any, point, in, the, war, xing, jie, divided, his, forces, into, four, groups, with, ma, gui, leading, the, offensive, against, ulsan, yet, again, li, rumei, li, rusong, s, brother, leading, the, offensive, against, sacheon, chen, lin, commanding, the, navy, and, liu, ting, and, yi, sun, sin, coordinating, a, land, sea, effort, against, suncheon, just, before, they, set, out, however, news, came, that, li, rusong, was, killed, by, mongolian, tribesmen, back, in, liaodong, xing, jie, decided, then, to, remove, his, emotionally, weakened, brother, li, rumei, in, favor, of, dong, yiyuan, in, june, 1598, after, commander, konishi, yukinaga, raised, concerns, about, the, supply, situation, and, limited, prospects, for, further, territorial, gains, in, the, peninsula, 70, 000, troops, were, withdrawn, back, to, japan, with, only, 60, 000, left, behind, to, guard, the, territory, still, under, japanese, control, these, forces, were, mostly, satsuma, soldiers, of, the, shimazu, clan, under, commanders, shimazu, yoshihiro, and, his, son, tadatsune, kato, kiyomasa, remained, in, command, of, the, defenses, of, ulsan, while, konishi, yukinaga, himself, commanded, the, defenses, at, suncheon, the, forces, at, sacheon, and, ulsan, continued, to, be, engaged, in, a, military, deadlock, in, the, months, that, followed, at, ulsan, kato, kiyomasa, defended, the,

japanese, the, ming, and, joseon, forces, withdrew, with, heavy, losses, the, chinese, believed, that, sacheon, was, crucial, to, their, goal, of, retaking, the, lost, castles, in, korea, and, ordered, a, general, attack, although, the, chinese, made, initial, progress, the, tide, of, battle, turned, when, japanese, reinforcements, attacked, the, rear, of, the, chinese, army, and, the, japanese, soldiers, inside, the, fortress, sallied, from, the, gates, and, counter, attacked, the, chinese, ming, forces, retreated, with, 30, 000, losses, with, the, japanese, in, pursuit, the, ming, army, actually, lost, 7, 000, soldiers, the, record, of, 30000, people, comes, from, japan, but, in, japanese, history, books, the, ming, army, had, 200, 000, or, even, 1, 000, 000, people, which, is, impossible, according, to, chinese, and, korean, sources, concerning, the, battle, the, forces, led, by, dong, yiyuan, had, breached, the, castle, wall, and, were, making, progress, in, capturing, the, castle, until, a, gunpowder, accident, caused, an, explosion, in, their, camp, and, the, japanese, took, advantage, of, the, situation, to, rout, the, confused, and, weakened, troops, at, suncheon, konishi, yukinaga, defended, his, position, at, the, suncheon, castle, along, with, 13, 700, japanese, soldiers, a, total, of, 43, 000, ming, and, joseon, troops, tried, to, capture, it, but, their, attempts, were, repulsed, after, three, failed, assaults, suffering, 800, losses, in, the, fall, of, 1598, following, the, successful, japanese, defense, at, the, battles, of, sacheon, ulsan, and, suncheon, the, ming, joseon, and, japanese, forces, were, locked, in, a, military, stalemate, in, the, south, of, the, peninsula, after, the, death, of, toyotomi, hideyoshi, on, september, 18, 1598, the, council, of, five, elders, in, late, october, issued, orders, for, the, withdrawal, of, all, forces, from, korea, hideyoshi, s, death, was, kept, a, secret, by, the, council, to, preserve, the, morale, of, the, army, the, battle, of, noryang, was, the, final, naval, battle, in, the, war, a, japanese, fleet, of, approximately, 500, ships, under, shimazu, yoshihiro, was, assembled, and, preparing, to, link, up, with, the, blockaded, fleet, under, konishi, yukinaga, and, together, withdraw, via, busan, back, to, japan, the, korean, navy, under, yi, sun, sin, discovered, the, shimazu, fleet, anchored, in, the, narrow, strait, of, noryang, noting, the, narrow, geography, of, the, area, ming, general, chen, lin, who, led, deng, zilong, and, yi, sun, sin, made, a, surprise, attack, against, the, japanese, fleet, under, the, cover, of, darkness, on, december, 16, 1598, using, cannon, and, fire, arrows, by, dawn, more, than, half, of, the, japanese, fleet, was, scattered, and, destroyed, during, the, pursuit, of, the, remaining, japanese, ships, both, yi, sun, sin, and, deng, zilong, were, killed, despite, suffering, high, casualties, in, the, end, the, battle, was, a, great, tactical, victory, for, the, korean, forces, and, resulted, in, the, loss, of, over, half, of, the, japanese, fleet, and, the, deaths, of, thousands, of, their, men, strategically, the, japanese, attained, their, objective, by, allowing, konishi, yukinaga, who, was, earlier, blockaded, by, the, ming, and, korean, forces, to, leave, his, fortress, on, december, 16, with, his, men, and, withdraw, unopposed, by, sailing, through, the, southern, end, of, namhae, island, bypassing, both, the, noryang, strait, and, the, battle, with, the, cost, of, betraying, his, own, fellow, japanese, generals, konishi, yukinaga, shimazu, yoshihiro, kat, kiyomasa, and, other, japanese, generals, of, the, left, army, congregated, in, busan, and, withdrew, to, japan, on, december, 21, the, last, ships, damaged, sailed, to, japan, on, december, 24, bringing, an, end, to, six, years, of, war, as, tsushima, island, had, suffered, greatly, from, its, loss, of, trade, with, korea, as, a, result, of, the, invasions, s, yoshitoshi, of, the, s, clan, then, dominant, in, tsushima, undertook, the, lead, in, the, peace, negotiations, by, japan, he, sent, four, peace, missions, to, joseon, in, 1599, to, normalize, relations, the, first, three, were, captured, and, sent, directly, to, beijing, by, chinese, troops, but, the, fourth, one, in, 1601, successfully, obtained, from, the, joseon, court, the, promise, of, a, normalizing, of, relations, upon, the, return, of, remaining, joseon, captives, as, ming, troops, continued, to, be, present, in, korea, following, the, withdrawal, of, japanese, forces, the, major, incentive, for, joseon, for, the, normalization, of, relations, with, japan, was, the, withdrawal, of, the, chinese, soldiers, from, their, territory, the, ming, chinese, themselves, were, causing, havoc, and, their, presence, continued, to, strain, joseon, s, national, economy, and, infrastructure, in, response, to, the, joseon, request, yoshitoshi, promptly, released, several, joseon, prisoners, and, between, 1603, and, 1604, helped, the, joseon, envoys, to, repatriate, a, further, 3, 000, by, organizing, negotiations, at, kyoto, with, tokugawa, ieyasu, by, then, the, shogun, of, japan, in, the, continuation, of, the, diplomatic, talks, toward, peaceful, relations, joseon, in, 1606, expanded, its, conditions, and, demanded, that, the, shogun, write, a, formal, letter, requesting, peace, and, to, extradite, the, japanese, soldiers, who, had, defiled, the, joseon, royal, tombs, near, hanseong, realizing, that, the, shogunate, would, never, agree, to, such, a, request, s, yoshitoshi, sent, a, forged, letter, and, a, group, of, criminals, instead, the, great, need, to, expel, the, ming, soldiers, pushed, joseon, into, accepting, and, to, send, an, emissary, in, 1608, the, result, was, a, return, of, joseon, prisoners, and, the, restoration, of, diplomatic, and, trade, relations, between, the, two, countries, the, japanese, invasions, were, east, asia, s, first, regional, wars, involving, massed, armies, equipped, with, modern, weapons, the, conflict, saw, the, regular, employment, of, japanese, armies, of, up, to, 200, 000, men, ming, chinese, armies, of, 80, 000, and, the, ongoing, deployment, of, local, korean, forces, numbering, in, the, hundreds, of, thousands, the, invasions, also, stood, as, a, challenge, to, the, existing, chinese, world, order, on, two, levels, the, military, in, which, the, war, challenged, ming, china, s, status, as, the, supreme, military, power, in, east, asia, and, the, political, in, which, the, war, affirmed, chinese, willingness, to, aid, in, the, protection, of, its, tributary, states, contrary, to, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, intentions, the, cost, of, the, japanese, invasions, of, korea, significantly, weakened, the, toyotomi, clan, s, power, in, japan, after, hideyoshi, s, death, his, young, son, toyotomi, hideyori, became, head, of, the, toyotomi, clan, however, the, losses, suffered, by, varying, daimy, s, during, the, campaign, were, a, contributing, factor, to, the, imbalance, of, power, in, japan, after, the, war, as, the, western, based, daimy, s, of, kyushu, and, western, honshu, partially, by, geographic, convenience, contributed, the, majority, of, the, forces, used, during, the, korean, conflict, it, left, the, pro, hideyoshi, alliance, weakened, for, the, eventual, struggle, with, the, mostly, eastern, backed, forces, of, tokugawa, ieyasu, who, himself, never, sent, forces, to, korea, tokugawa, would, go, on, to, unify, japan, and, establish, himself, as, shogun, in, 1603, following, the, decisive, battle, of, sekigahara, against, a, coalition, of, mostly, western, based, daimy, s, ming, china, also, sustained, a, heavy, financial, burden, for, its, role, in, defending, korea, while, also, fighting, several, other, conflicts, in, the, same, decade, falling, tax, revenues, troop, desertions, a, flow, of, foreign, silver, which, brought, unexpected, problems, in, the, chinese, economy, poor, granary, supervision, and, harsh, weather, eventually, culminated, in, the, collapse, of, the, ming, dynasty, the, ming, dynasty, was, eventually, defeated, by, a, rebel, leader, named, li, zicheng, with, the, help, of, wu, sangui, a, former, ming, general, the, manchus, defeated, li, and, established, its, rule, over, china, in, 1644, however, the, sinocentric, tributary, system, that, the, ming, had, defended, continued, to, be, maintained, by, the, qing, and, ultimately, the, war, resulted, in, a, maintenance, of, the, status, quo, with, the, re, establishment, of, trade, and, the, normalization, of, relations, between, all, three, parties, given, that, the, conflict, was, fought, exclusively, on, korean, soil, korea, ultimately, suffered, the, most, damage, of, the, three, participants, it, lost, a, large, portion, of, its, military, strength, and, civilian, population, had, numerous, cultural, heritage, sites, damaged, or, destroyed, and, many, of, its, technological, advancements, pillaged, in, many, ways, the, invasions, proved, to, be, more, devastating, than, any, other, event, in, the, nation, s, history, even, arguably, more, so, than, the, korean, war, the, peninsula, suffered, a, reduction, of, arable, land, to, 66, of, the, prewar, total, greatly, hurting, korea, s, mainly, agricultural, economy, in, the, years, that, followed, famine, disease, and, rebellions, were, widespread, throughout, korea, in, gyeongsang, province, alone, 90, of, the, land, under, cultivation, was, destroyed, significant, losses, of, historical, archives, cultural, and, scientific, artifacts, such, as, the, ja, gyuk, roo, water, clock, and, skilled, artisans, resulted, in, a, waning, of, korean, science, the, main, korean, royal, palaces, gyeongbokgung, changdeokgung, and, changgyeonggung, were, burned, down, and, deoksugung, was, used, as, a, temporary, palace, the, baekjeong, korean, natives, of, the, lowest, social, rank, took, advantage, of, the, lack, of, internal, security, brought, on, by, the, invasions, and, set, fire, to, changnye, korean, government, offices, in, which, census, ledgers, had, been, kept, the, destruction, of, land, and, census, registers, made, fiscal, recovery, difficult, since, taxation, and, corv, e, labour, were, based, on, them, the, government, was, forced, to, trade, rank, and, titles, in, order, to, obtain, grain, using, a, practice, called, napsok, pogwan, appointment, through, grain, contributions, and, the, yangban, elite, which, was, exempt, from, household, taxes, exploited, the, occasion, to, increase, its, landholdings, thereby, further, depriving, the, central, government, of, taxes, raised, on, property, the, total, military, and, civilian, casualties, as, estimated, by, the, late, 19th, century, historian, george, h, jones, were, one, million, and, total, combat, casualties, were, estimated, at, between, 250, 000, and, 300, 000, a, total, of, over, 100, 000, japanese, 185, 000, korean, and, over, 29, 000, chinese, troops, were, killed, and, an, estimated, 50, 000, to, 60, 000, captives, were, taken, by, the, japanese, throughout, the, war, among, those, captured, a, total, of, 7, 500, were, later, returned, to, korea, through, diplomatic, means, at, the, conclusion, of, the, conflict, a, large, portion, of, the, remaining, captives, were, sold, to, european, traders, mainly, portuguese, in, macau, who, then, resold, them, throughout, southeast, asia, although, korea, suffered, the, most, of, the, three, combatants, there, were, some, significant, technological, and, cultural, transfers, that, resulted, from, the, war, japanese, swords, which, were, sometimes, collected, in, the, battlefield, from, dead, japanese, soldiers, would, inspire, some, of, the, basic, designs, of, later, korean, swords, such, as, the, hwando, arquebus, rifles, which, the, joseon, court, had, initially, dismissed, as, ineffective, and, useless, due, to, their, low, rate, of, fire, was, rapidly, adopted, during, and, after, the, war, by, the, joseon, military, and, production, began, as, early, as, 1593, some, scholars, believe, that, the, reason, the, joseon, ming, army, was, not, easily, driven, out, and, defeated, during, the, reignition, of, hostilities, in, 1597, was, in, part, due, to, the, widespread, adoption, of, arquebuses, in, the, joseon, military, besides, this, catholicism, was, first, introduced, in, korea, during, the, war, as, catholic, missionaries, had, begun, arriving, in, japan, before, the, war, and, had, become, acquainted, in, korea, many, of, the, first, converts, to, catholicism, were, korean, captives, in, japan, records, indicate, more, than, 7, 000, korean, captives, converted, from, 1594, to, 1598, spanish, missionary, gregorio, de, c, spedes, 1551, 1611, was, a, prominent, driver, behind, this, missionary, work, and, was, also, the, first, recorded, westerner, to, arrive, in, korea, and, the, only, european, eyewitness, to, the, war, last, but, not, least, significant, food, and, luxury, items, were, introduced, to, korea, via, the, invasions, evidence, heavily, suggests, this, because, korean, records, initially, recorded, chili, peppers, one, of, the, most, important, ingredients, in, modern, korean, cuisine, as, japanese, mustard, southern, barbarian, herb, and, japanese, herb, the, captives, brought, to, japan, including, scholars, craftsmen, medicine, makers, and, gold, smelters, provided, japan, with, many, cultural, and, technological, gains, in, the, years, that, followed, japanese, pottery, and, art, advanced, and, developed, a, significant, similarity, to, their, korean, counterparts, advances, in, other, areas, such, as, agriculture, were, also, aided, by, technology, and, artisans, acquired, and, captured, during, the, invasions, japanese, typography, advanced, with, the, adoption, of, chinese, fonts, because, korean, pottery, was, highly, prized, in, japan, many, japanese, lords, established, pottery, producing, kilns, with, captured, korean, potters, in, kyushu, and, other, parts, of, japan, the, production, of, arita, porcelain, in, japan, began, in, 1616, at, the, town, of, imari, with, the, aid, of, korean, potters, who, had, been, enticed, to, relocate, there, after, the, war, furthermore, neo, confucianism, which, had, originated, from, china, and, spread, to, korea, was, introduced, to, japan, because, of, the, invasions, many, korean, scholars, who, were, captured, during, the, war, by, the, japanese, would, later, become, tutors, of, prominent, japanese, daimyo, furthermore, many, classical, confucian, texts, were, captured, during, the, early, stages, of, the, war, and, taken, back, to, japan, japanese, troops, engaged, in, crimes, against, civilians, in, battles, and, often, killed, indiscriminately, scorched, earth, policies, were, often, employed, over, 60, of, farmland, was, destroyed, and, burned, and, farm, animals, were, slaughtered, to, prevent, their, use, by, joseon, or, ming, forces, outside, of, the, main, battles, raids, to, acquire, food, and, supplies, from, civilians, were, common, captured, prisoners, were, often, mistreated, or, worked, to, near, death, by, starvation, and, neglect, in, following, their, battlefield, practice, at, the, time, the, japanese, also, collected, the, ears, and, noses, of, dead, soldiers, as, proof, of, their, exploits, on, the, battlefield, and, as, a, record, of, casualty, counts, the, high, casualty, rate, of, the, joseon, and, ming, forces, and, the, large, number, of, ears, collected, during, the, campaign, was, enough, to, build, a, large, mound, near, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, great, buddha, called, the, mimizuka, mound, of, ears, korean, armies, were, also, known, to, forcefully, acquire, food, and, supplies, from, civilians, both, on, an, individual, and, organized, level, korean, bandits, and, highwaymen, also, took, advantage, of, the, chaos, during, the, war, to, form, raiding, parties, and, rob, other, koreans, according, to,
