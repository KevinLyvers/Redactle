known, as, the, first, gulf, war, was, an, armed, conflict, between, iran, and, iraq, that, lasted, from, september, 1980, to, august, 1988, active, hostilities, began, with, the, iraqi, invasion, of, iran, and, lasted, for, nearly, eight, years, until, the, acceptance, of, united, nations, security, council, resolution, 598, by, both, sides, iraq, s, primary, rationale, for, the, attack, against, iran, cited, the, need, to, prevent, ruhollah, khomeini, who, had, spearheaded, the, iranian, revolution, in, 1979, from, exporting, the, new, iranian, ideology, to, iraq, there, were, also, fears, among, the, iraqi, leadership, of, saddam, hussein, that, iran, a, theocratic, state, with, a, population, predominantly, composed, of, shia, muslims, would, exploit, sectarian, tensions, in, iraq, by, rallying, iraq, s, shia, majority, against, the, ba, athist, government, which, was, officially, secular, and, dominated, by, sunni, muslims, iraq, also, wished, to, replace, iran, as, the, power, player, in, the, persian, gulf, which, was, not, seen, as, an, achievable, objective, prior, to, the, islamic, revolution, because, of, pahlavi, iran, s, economic, and, military, superiority, as, well, as, its, close, relationships, with, the, united, states, and, israel, the, iran, iraq, war, followed, a, long, running, history, of, territorial, border, disputes, between, the, two, states, as, a, result, of, which, iraq, planned, to, retake, the, eastern, bank, of, the, shatt, al, arab, that, it, had, ceded, to, iran, in, the, 1975, algiers, agreement, iraqi, support, for, arab, separatists, in, iran, increased, following, the, outbreak, of, hostilities, saddam, disputedly, may, have, wished, to, annex, iran, s, arab, majority, khuzestan, province, while, the, iraqi, leadership, had, hoped, to, take, advantage, of, iran, s, post, revolutionary, chaos, and, expected, a, decisive, victory, in, the, face, of, a, severely, weakened, iran, the, iraqi, military, only, made, progress, for, three, months, and, by, december, 1980, the, iraqi, invasion, had, stalled, the, iranian, military, began, to, gain, momentum, against, the, iraqis, and, regained, all, lost, territory, by, june, 1982, after, pushing, iraqi, forces, back, to, the, pre, war, border, lines, iran, rejected, united, nations, security, council, resolution, 514, and, launched, an, invasion, of, iraq, the, subsequent, iranian, offensive, within, iraqi, territory, lasted, for, five, years, with, iraq, taking, back, the, initiative, in, mid, 1988, and, subsequently, launching, a, series, of, major, counter, offensives, that, ultimately, led, to, the, conclusion, of, the, war, in, a, stalemate, the, eight, years, of, war, exhaustion, economic, devastation, decreased, morale, military, stalemate, inaction, by, the, international, community, towards, the, use, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, by, iraqi, forces, on, iranian, soldiers, and, civilians, as, well, as, increasing, iran, united, states, military, tensions, all, culminated, in, iran, s, acceptance, of, a, ceasefire, brokered, by, the, united, nations, security, council, in, total, around, 500, 000, people, were, killed, during, the, iran, iraq, war, with, iran, bearing, the, larger, share, of, the, casualties, excluding, the, tens, of, thousands, of, civilians, killed, in, the, concurrent, anfal, campaign, that, targeted, iraqi, kurdistan, the, end, of, the, conflict, resulted, in, neither, reparations, nor, border, changes, and, the, combined, financial, losses, suffered, by, both, combatants, is, believed, to, have, exceeded, us, 1, trillion, there, were, a, number, of, proxy, forces, operating, for, both, countries, iraq, and, the, pro, iraqi, arab, separatist, militias, in, iran, were, most, notably, supported, by, the, national, council, of, resistance, of, iran, whereas, iran, re, established, an, alliance, with, the, iraqi, kurds, being, primarily, supported, by, the, kurdistan, democratic, party, and, the, patriotic, union, of, kurdistan, during, the, conflict, iraq, received, an, abundance, of, financial, political, and, logistical, aid, from, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, the, soviet, union, france, italy, yugoslavia, and, the, overwhelming, majority, of, arab, countries, while, iran, was, comparatively, isolated, to, a, large, degree, it, received, a, significant, amount, of, aid, from, syria, libya, china, north, korea, israel, pakistan, and, south, yemen, the, conflict, has, been, compared, to, world, war, i, in, terms, of, the, tactics, used, by, both, sides, including, large, scale, trench, warfare, with, barbed, wire, stretched, across, fortified, defensive, lines, manned, machine, gun, posts, bayonet, charges, iranian, human, wave, attacks, iraq, s, extensive, use, of, chemical, weapons, and, deliberate, attacks, on, civilian, targets, the, discourses, on, martyrdom, formulated, in, the, iranian, shia, islamic, context, led, to, the, widespread, usage, of, human, wave, attacks, and, thus, had, a, lasting, impact, on, the, dynamics, of, the, conflict, in, april, 1969, iran, abrogated, the, 1937, treaty, over, the, shatt, al, arab, and, iranian, ships, stopped, paying, tolls, to, iraq, when, they, used, the, shatt, al, arab, the, shah, argued, that, the, 1937, treaty, was, unfair, to, iran, because, almost, all, river, borders, around, the, world, ran, along, the, thalweg, and, because, most, of, the, ships, that, used, the, shatt, al, arab, were, iranian, iraq, threatened, war, over, the, iranian, move, but, on, 24, april, 1969, an, iranian, tanker, escorted, by, iranian, warships, joint, operation, arvand, sailed, down, the, shatt, al, arab, and, iraq, being, the, militarily, weaker, state, did, nothing, the, iranian, abrogation, of, the, 1937, treaty, marked, the, beginning, of, a, period, of, acute, iraqi, iranian, tension, that, would, see, significant, bloodshed, and, was, to, last, until, the, algiers, agreement, of, 1975, the, relationship, between, the, governments, of, iran, and, iraq, briefly, improved, in, 1978, when, iranian, agents, in, iraq, discovered, plans, for, a, pro, soviet, coup, d, tat, against, iraq, s, government, when, informed, of, this, plot, saddam, ordered, the, execution, of, dozens, of, his, army, s, officers, and, in, a, sign, of, reconciliation, expelled, from, iraq, ruhollah, khomeini, an, exiled, leader, of, clerical, opposition, to, the, shah, tensions, between, iraq, and, iran, were, fuelled, by, iran, s, islamic, revolution, and, its, appearance, of, being, a, pan, islamic, force, in, contrast, to, iraq, s, arab, nationalism, despite, iraq, s, goal, of, regaining, the, shatt, al, arab, the, iraqi, government, initially, seemed, to, welcome, the, iranian, revolution, which, overthrew, shah, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, who, was, seen, as, a, common, enemy, there, were, frequent, clashes, along, the, iran, iraq, border, throughout, 1980, with, iraq, publicly, complaining, of, at, least, 544, incidents, and, iran, citing, at, least, 797, violations, of, its, border, and, airspace, ayatollah, ruhollah, khomeini, called, on, iraqis, to, overthrow, the, ba, ath, government, which, was, received, with, considerable, anger, in, baghdad, on, 17, july, 1979, despite, khomeini, s, call, saddam, gave, a, speech, praising, the, iranian, revolution, and, called, for, an, iraqi, iranian, friendship, based, on, non, interference, in, each, other, s, internal, affairs, when, khomeini, rejected, saddam, s, overture, by, calling, for, islamic, revolution, in, iraq, saddam, was, alarmed, iran, s, new, islamic, administration, was, regarded, in, baghdad, as, an, irrational, existential, threat, to, the, ba, ath, government, especially, because, the, ba, ath, party, having, a, secular, nature, discriminated, against, and, posed, a, threat, to, the, fundamentalist, shia, movement, in, iraq, whose, clerics, were, iran, s, allies, within, iraq, and, whom, khomeini, saw, as, oppressed, saddam, s, primary, interest, in, war, may, have, also, stemmed, from, his, desire, to, right, the, supposed, wrong, of, the, algiers, agreement, in, addition, to, finally, achieving, his, desire, of, becoming, the, regional, superpower, saddam, s, goal, was, to, supplant, egypt, as, the, leader, of, the, arab, world, and, to, achieve, hegemony, over, the, persian, gulf, he, saw, iran, s, increased, weakness, due, to, revolution, sanctions, and, international, isolation, saddam, had, invested, heavily, in, iraq, s, military, since, his, defeat, against, iran, in, 1975, buying, large, amounts, of, weaponry, from, the, soviet, union, and, france, between, 1973, and, 1980, alone, iraq, purchased, an, estimated, 1, 600, tanks, and, apcs, and, over, 200, soviet, made, aircraft, by, 1980, iraq, possessed, 242, 000, soldiers, second, only, to, egypt, in, the, arab, world, 2, 350, tanks, and, 340, combat, aircraft, watching, the, disintegration, of, the, powerful, iranian, army, that, frustrated, him, in, 1974, 1975, he, saw, an, opportunity, to, attack, using, the, threat, of, islamic, revolution, as, a, pretext, iraqi, military, intelligence, reported, in, july, 1980, that, despite, iran, s, bellicose, rhetoric, it, is, clear, that, at, present, iran, has, no, power, to, launch, wide, offensive, operations, against, iraq, or, to, defend, on, a, large, scale, days, before, the, iraqi, invasion, and, in, the, midst, of, rapidly, escalating, cross, border, skirmishes, iraqi, military, intelligence, again, reiterated, on, 14, september, that, the, enemy, deployment, organization, does, not, indicate, hostile, intentions, and, appears, to, be, taking, on, a, more, defensive, mode, some, scholars, writing, prior, to, the, opening, of, formerly, classified, iraqi, archives, such, as, alistair, finlan, argued, that, saddam, was, drawn, into, a, conflict, with, iran, due, to, the, border, clashes, and, iranian, meddling, in, iraqi, domestic, affairs, finlan, stated, in, 2003, that, the, iraqi, invasion, was, meant, to, be, a, limited, operation, in, order, to, send, a, political, message, to, the, iranians, to, keep, out, of, iraqi, domestic, affairs, whereas, kevin, m, woods, and, williamson, murray, stated, in, 2014, that, the, balance, of, evidence, suggests, saddam, was, seeking, a, convenient, excuse, for, war, in, 1980, on, 8, march, 1980, iran, announced, it, was, withdrawing, its, ambassador, from, iraq, downgraded, its, diplomatic, ties, to, the, charge, d, affaires, level, and, demanded, that, iraq, do, the, same, the, following, day, iraq, declared, iran, s, ambassador, persona, non, grata, and, demanded, his, withdrawal, from, iraq, by, 15, march, in, iran, severe, officer, purges, including, numerous, executions, ordered, by, sadegh, khalkhali, the, new, revolutionary, court, judge, and, shortages, of, spare, parts, for, iran, s, american, and, british, made, equipment, had, crippled, iran, s, once, mighty, military, between, february, and, september, 1979, iran, s, government, executed, 85, senior, generals, and, forced, all, major, generals, and, most, brigadier, generals, into, early, retirement, by, september, 1980, the, revolutionary, government, had, purged, some, 12, 000, officers, of, all, levels, from, the, army, these, purges, resulted, in, a, drastic, decline, in, the, iranian, military, s, operational, capacities, on, the, eve, of, the, revolution, in, 1978, international, experts, in, military, science, had, assessed, that, iran, s, armed, forces, were, the, fifth, most, powerful, in, the, world, however, by, the, eve, of, war, with, iraq, the, recently, formidable, iranian, army, was, in, many, crucial, ways, a, shell, of, its, former, self, having, been, badly, weakened, by, losses, in, experienced, personnel, the, desertion, rate, had, reached, 60, the, officer, corps, was, devastated, and, its, most, highly, skilled, soldiers, and, aviators, had, been, exiled, imprisoned, or, executed, when, the, invasion, occurred, many, pilots, and, officers, were, released, from, prison, or, had, their, executions, commuted, to, combat, the, iraqis, throughout, the, war, iran, never, managed, to, fully, recover, from, this, flight, of, human, capital, many, junior, officers, were, promoted, to, generals, resulting, in, the, army, being, more, integrated, as, a, part, of, the, regime, by, the, war, s, end, meanwhile, a, new, paramilitary, organisation, gained, prominence, in, iran, the, islamic, revolutionary, guard, corps, created, to, protect, the, new, regime, and, serve, as, a, counterbalance, to, the, army, the, revolutionary, guards, irgc, had, been, trained, to, act, only, as, a, militia, and, struggled, to, adapt, as, needed, following, the, iraqi, invasion, initially, refusing, to, fight, alongside, the, regular, army, resulting, in, many, defeats, it, was, not, until, 1982, that, the, two, groups, began, carrying, out, combined, operations, an, additional, paramilitary, militia, was, founded, in, response, to, the, invasion, the, army, of, 20, million, commonly, known, as, the, basij, the, basij, were, poorly, armed, and, had, members, as, young, as, 12, and, as, old, as, 70, they, often, acted, in, conjunction, with, the, revolutionary, guard, launching, so, called, human, wave, attacks, and, other, campaigns, against, the, iraqis, they, were, subordinate, to, the, revolutionary, guards, and, they, made, up, most, of, the, manpower, that, was, used, in, the, revolutionary, guard, s, attacks, stephen, pelletiere, wrote, in, his, 1992, book, the, iran, iraq, war, chaos, in, a, vacuum, the, human, wave, has, been, largely, misconstrued, both, by, the, popular, media, in, the, west, and, by, many, scholars, the, iranians, did, not, merely, assemble, masses, of, individuals, point, them, at, the, enemy, and, order, a, charge, the, waves, were, made, up, of, the, 22, man, squads, mentioned, above, each, squad, was, assigned, a, specific, objective, in, battle, they, would, surge, forward, to, accomplish, their, missions, and, thus, gave, the, impression, of, a, human, wave, pouring, against, enemy, lines, despite, neglect, by, the, new, regime, at, the, outset, of, the, conflict, iran, still, had, at, least, 1, 000, operational, tanks, and, several, hundred, functional, aircraft, and, could, cannibalize, equipment, to, procure, spare, parts, continuous, sanctions, greatly, limited, iran, from, acquiring, many, additional, heavy, weapons, including, tanks, and, aircraft, in, addition, the, area, around, the, shatt, al, arab, posed, no, obstacle, for, the, iraqis, as, they, possessed, river, crossing, equipment, iraq, correctly, deduced, that, iran, s, defences, at, the, crossing, points, around, the, karkheh, and, karoun, rivers, were, undermanned, and, that, the, rivers, could, be, easily, crossed, iraqi, intelligence, was, also, informed, that, the, iranian, forces, in, khuzestan, province, which, consisted, of, two, divisions, prior, to, the, revolution, now, only, consisted, of, several, ill, equipped, and, under, strength, battalions, only, a, handful, of, company, sized, tank, units, remained, operational, the, only, qualms, the, iraqis, had, were, over, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, air, force, formerly, the, imperial, iranian, air, force, despite, the, purge, of, several, key, pilots, and, commanders, as, well, as, the, lack, of, spare, parts, the, air, force, showed, its, power, during, local, uprisings, and, rebellions, they, were, also, active, after, the, failed, u, s, attempt, to, rescue, its, hostages, operation, eagle, claw, based, on, these, observations, iraq, s, leaders, decided, to, carry, out, a, surprise, airstrike, against, the, iranian, air, force, s, infrastructure, prior, to, the, main, invasion, it, is, widely, accepted, among, scholars, that, iraq, was, seeking, to, annex, or, at, least, to, establish, suzerainty, over, iran, s, khuzestan, province, but, saddam, hussein, publicly, denied, this, in, november, 1980, on, 10, september, 1980, iraq, forcibly, reclaimed, territories, in, zain, al, qaws, and, saif, saad, that, it, had, been, promised, under, the, terms, of, the, 1975, algiers, agreement, but, that, iran, had, never, handed, over, leading, to, both, iran, and, iraq, declaring, the, treaty, null, and, void, on, 14, september, and, 17, september, respectively, as, a, result, the, only, outstanding, border, dispute, between, iran, and, iraq, at, the, time, of, the, iraqi, invasion, of, 22, september, was, the, question, of, whether, iranian, ships, would, fly, iraqi, flags, and, pay, iraq, navigation, fees, for, a, stretch, of, the, shatt, al, arab, river, spanning, several, miles, iraq, launched, a, full, scale, invasion, of, iran, on, 22, september, 1980, the, iraqi, air, force, launched, surprise, air, strikes, on, ten, iranian, airfields, with, the, objective, of, destroying, the, iranian, air, force, the, attack, failed, to, cripple, the, iranian, air, force, while, it, damaged, some, of, iran, s, airbase, infrastructure, it, did, not, destroy, a, significant, number, of, aircraft, the, iraqi, air, force, was, only, able, to, strike, in, depth, with, a, few, mig, 23bn, tu, 22, and, su, 20, aircraft, and, iran, had, built, hardened, aircraft, shelters, where, most, of, its, combat, aircraft, were, stored, the, next, day, iraq, launched, a, ground, invasion, mounting, three, simultaneous, attacks, along, a, 644, km, 400, mi, front, saddam, hoped, an, attack, on, iran, would, cause, such, a, blow, to, iran, s, prestige, that, it, would, lead, to, the, new, government, s, downfall, or, at, least, end, iran, s, calls, for, his, overthrow, of, iraq, s, six, divisions, that, invaded, by, ground, four, were, sent, to, khuzestan, which, was, located, near, the, border, s, southern, end, to, cut, off, the, shatt, al, arab, from, the, rest, of, iran, and, to, establish, a, territorial, security, zone, 22, the, other, two, divisions, invaded, across, the, northern, and, central, part, of, the, border, to, prevent, an, iranian, counter, attack, two, of, the, four, iraqi, divisions, one, mechanised, and, one, armoured, operated, near, the, southern, end, and, began, a, siege, of, the, strategically, important, port, cities, of, abadan, and, khorramshahr, 22, the, two, armoured, divisions, secured, the, territory, bounded, by, the, cities, of, khorramshahr, ahvaz, susangerd, and, musian, 22, on, the, central, front, the, iraqis, occupied, mehran, advanced, towards, the, foothills, of, the, zagros, mountains, and, were, able, to, block, the, traditional, tehran, baghdad, invasion, route, by, securing, territory, forward, of, qasr, e, shirin, iran, 23, on, the, northern, front, the, iraqis, attempted, to, establish, a, strong, defensive, position, opposite, suleimaniya, to, protect, the, iraqi, kirkuk, oil, complex, 23, iraqi, hopes, of, an, uprising, by, the, ethnic, arabs, of, khuzestan, failed, to, materialise, as, most, of, the, ethnic, arabs, remained, loyal, to, iran, the, iraqi, troops, advancing, into, iran, in, 1980, were, described, by, patrick, brogan, as, badly, led, and, lacking, in, offensive, spirit, 261, the, first, known, chemical, weapons, attack, by, iraq, on, iran, probably, took, place, during, the, fighting, around, susangerd, adnan, khayr, allah, served, as, iraqi, minister, of, defence, throughout, the, iran, iraq, war, and, was, appointed, deputy, supreme, commander, of, the, armed, forces, second, only, to, saddam, hussein, in, this, position, he, played, a, crucial, role, in, rebuilding, and, modernizing, the, iraqi, military, though, the, iraqi, air, invasion, surprised, the, iranians, the, iranian, air, force, retaliated, the, day, after, with, a, large, scale, attack, against, iraqi, air, bases, and, infrastructure, in, operation, kaman, 99, groups, of, f, 4, phantom, and, f, 5, tiger, fighter, jets, attacked, targets, throughout, iraq, such, as, oil, facilities, dams, petrochemical, plants, and, oil, refineries, and, included, mosul, airbase, baghdad, and, the, kirkuk, oil, refinery, iraq, was, taken, by, surprise, at, the, strength, of, the, retaliation, which, caused, the, iraqis, heavy, losses, and, economic, disruption, but, the, iranians, took, heavy, losses, as, well, as, losing, many, aircraft, and, aircrews, to, iraqi, air, defenses, iranian, army, aviation, s, ah, 1, cobra, helicopter, gunships, began, attacks, on, the, advancing, iraqi, divisions, along, with, f, 4, phantoms, armed, with, agm, 65, maverick, missiles, they, destroyed, numerous, armoured, vehicles, and, impeded, the, iraqi, advance, though, not, completely, halting, it, meanwhile, iraqi, air, attacks, on, iran, were, repelled, by, iran, s, f, 14a, tomcat, interceptor, fighter, jets, using, aim, 54a, phoenix, missiles, which, downed, a, dozen, of, iraq, s, soviet, built, fighters, in, the, first, two, days, of, battle, the, iranian, regular, military, police, forces, volunteer, basij, and, revolutionary, guards, all, conducted, their, operations, separately, thus, the, iraqi, invading, forces, did, not, face, coordinated, resistance, however, on, 24, september, the, iranian, navy, attacked, basra, iraq, destroying, two, oil, terminals, near, the, iraqi, port, of, al, faw, which, reduced, iraq, s, ability, to, export, oil, the, iranian, ground, forces, primarily, consisting, of, the, revolutionary, guard, retreated, to, the, cities, where, they, set, up, defences, against, the, invaders, on, 30, september, iran, s, air, force, launched, operation, scorch, sword, striking, and, badly, damaging, the, nearly, complete, osirak, nuclear, reactor, near, baghdad, by, 1, october, baghdad, had, been, subjected, to, eight, air, attacks, 29, in, response, iraq, launched, aerial, strikes, against, iranian, targets, the, mountainous, border, between, iran, and, iraq, made, a, deep, ground, invasion, almost, impossible, and, air, strikes, were, used, instead, the, invasion, s, first, waves, were, a, series, of, air, strikes, targeted, at, iranian, airfields, iraq, also, attempted, to, bomb, tehran, iran, s, capital, and, command, centre, into, submission, on, 22, september, a, prolonged, battle, began, in, the, city, of, khorramshahr, eventually, leaving, around, 7, 000, dead, on, each, side, reflecting, the, bloody, nature, of, the, struggle, iranians, came, to, call, khorramshahr, city, of, blood, the, battle, began, with, iraqi, air, raids, against, key, points, and, mechanised, divisions, advancing, on, the, city, in, a, crescent, like, formation, they, were, slowed, by, iranian, air, attacks, and, revolutionary, guard, troops, with, recoilless, rifles, rocket, propelled, grenades, and, molotov, cocktails, the, iranians, flooded, the, marsh, areas, around, the, city, forcing, the, iraqis, to, traverse, through, narrow, strips, of, land, iraqi, tanks, launched, attacks, with, no, infantry, support, and, many, tanks, were, lost, to, iranian, anti, tank, teams, by, 30, september, the, iraqis, had, managed, to, clear, the, iranians, from, the, outskirts, of, the, city, the, next, day, the, iraqis, launched, infantry, and, armoured, attacks, into, the, city, after, heavy, house, to, house, fighting, the, iraqis, were, repelled, on, 14, october, the, iraqis, launched, a, second, offensive, the, iranians, initiated, a, controlled, withdrawal, from, the, city, street, by, street, by, 24, october, most, of, the, city, was, captured, and, the, iranians, evacuated, across, the, karun, river, some, partisans, remained, and, fighting, continued, until, 10, november, though, khorramshahr, was, captured, the, battle, had, delayed, the, iraqis, enough, to, allow, the, large, scale, deployment, of, the, iranian, military, in, november, saddam, ordered, his, forces, to, advance, towards, dezful, and, ahvaz, and, lay, sieges, to, both, cities, however, the, iraqi, offensive, had, been, badly, damaged, by, iranian, militias, and, air, power, iran, s, air, force, had, destroyed, iraq, s, army, supply, depots, and, fuel, supplies, and, was, strangling, iraq, through, an, aerial, siege, iran, s, supplies, had, not, been, exhausted, despite, sanctions, and, the, military, often, cannibalised, spare, parts, from, other, equipment, and, began, searching, for, parts, on, the, black, market, on, 28, november, iran, launched, operation, morvarid, pearl, a, combined, air, and, sea, attack, which, destroyed, 80, of, iraq, s, navy, and, all, of, its, radar, sites, in, the, southern, portion, of, the, country, when, iraq, laid, siege, to, abadan, and, dug, its, troops, in, around, the, city, it, was, unable, to, blockade, the, port, which, allowed, iran, to, resupply, abadan, by, sea, iraq, s, strategic, reserves, had, been, depleted, and, by, now, it, lacked, the, power, to, go, on, any, major, offensives, until, nearly, the, end, of, the, war, on, 7, december, hussein, announced, that, iraq, was, going, on, the, defensive, by, the, end, of, 1980, iraq, had, destroyed, about, 500, western, built, iranian, tanks, and, captured, 100, others, for, the, next, eight, months, both, sides, were, on, a, defensive, footing, with, the, exception, of, the, battle, of, dezful, as, the, iranians, needed, more, time, to, reorganise, their, forces, after, the, damage, inflicted, by, the, purge, of, 1979, 80, during, this, period, fighting, consisted, mainly, of, artillery, duels, and, raids, iraq, had, mobilised, 21, divisions, for, the, invasion, while, iran, countered, with, only, 13, regular, army, divisions, and, one, brigade, of, the, regular, divisions, only, seven, were, deployed, to, the, border, the, war, bogged, down, into, world, war, i, style, trench, warfare, with, tanks, and, modern, late, 20th, century, weapons, due, to, the, power, of, anti, tank, weapons, such, as, the, rpg, 7, armored, manoeuvre, by, the, iraqis, was, very, costly, and, they, consequently, entrenched, their, tanks, into, static, positions, iraq, also, began, firing, scud, missiles, into, dezful, and, ahvaz, and, used, terror, bombing, to, bring, the, war, to, the, iranian, civilian, population, iran, launched, dozens, of, human, wave, assaults, on, 5, january, 1981, iran, had, reorganised, its, forces, enough, to, launch, a, large, scale, offensive, operation, nasr, victory, the, iranians, launched, their, major, armoured, offensive, from, dezful, in, the, direction, of, susangerd, consisting, of, tank, brigades, from, the, 16th, qazvin, 77th, khorasan, and, 92nd, khuzestan, armoured, divisions, and, broke, through, iraqi, lines, 32, however, the, iranian, tanks, had, raced, through, iraqi, lines, with, their, flanks, unprotected, and, with, no, infantry, support, as, a, result, they, were, cut, off, by, iraqi, tanks, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, dezful, the, iranian, armoured, divisions, were, nearly, wiped, out, in, one, of, the, biggest, tank, battles, of, the, war, when, the, iranian, tanks, tried, to, manoeuvre, they, became, stuck, in, the, mud, of, the, marshes, and, many, tanks, were, abandoned, the, iraqis, lost, 45, t, 55, and, t, 62, tanks, while, the, iranians, lost, 100, 200, chieftain, and, m, 60, tanks, reporters, counted, roughly, 150, destroyed, or, deserted, iranian, tanks, and, also, 40, iraqi, tanks, 141, iranians, were, killed, during, the, battle, the, battle, had, been, ordered, by, iranian, president, abulhassan, banisadr, who, was, hoping, that, a, victory, might, shore, up, his, deteriorating, political, position, instead, the, failure, hastened, his, fall, 71, many, of, iran, s, problems, took, place, because, of, political, infighting, between, president, banisadr, who, supported, the, regular, army, and, the, hardliners, who, supported, the, irgc, once, he, was, impeached, and, the, competition, ended, the, performance, of, the, iranian, military, improved, the, islamic, republic, government, in, iran, was, further, distracted, by, internal, fighting, between, the, regime, and, the, mujahedin, e, khalq, mek, on, the, streets, of, iran, s, major, cities, in, june, 1981, and, again, in, september, 250, 251, in, 1983, the, mek, started, an, alliance, with, iraq, following, a, meeting, between, mek, leader, massoud, rajavi, and, iraqi, deputy, prime, minister, tariq, aziz, in, 1984, banisadr, left, the, coalition, because, of, a, dispute, with, rajavi, in, 1986, rajavi, moved, from, paris, to, iraq, and, set, up, a, base, on, the, iranian, border, the, battle, of, dezful, became, a, critical, battle, in, iranian, military, thinking, less, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, army, with, its, conventional, tactics, and, more, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, revolutionary, guard, with, its, unconventional, tactics, the, iraqi, air, force, badly, damaged, by, the, iranians, was, moved, to, the, h, 3, airbase, in, western, iraq, near, the, jordanian, border, and, away, from, iran, however, on, 3, april, 1981, the, iranian, air, force, used, eight, f, 4, phantom, fighter, bombers, four, f, 14, tomcats, three, boeing, 707, refuelling, tankers, and, one, boeing, 747, command, plane, to, launch, a, surprise, attack, on, h3, destroying, 27, 50, iraqi, fighter, jets, and, bombers, despite, the, successful, h, 3, airbase, attack, in, addition, to, other, air, attacks, the, iranian, air, force, was, forced, to, cancel, its, successful, 180, day, air, offensive, in, addition, they, abandoned, their, attempted, control, of, iranian, airspace, they, had, been, seriously, weakened, by, sanctions, and, pre, war, purges, and, further, damaged, by, a, fresh, purge, after, the, impeachment, crisis, of, president, banisadr, the, iranian, air, force, could, not, survive, further, attrition, and, decided, to, limit, their, losses, abandoning, efforts, to, control, iranian, airspace, the, iranian, air, force, would, henceforth, fight, on, the, defensive, trying, to, deter, the, iraqis, rather, than, engaging, them, while, throughout, 1981, 1982, the, iraqi, air, force, would, remain, weak, within, the, next, few, years, they, would, rearm, and, expand, again, and, begin, to, regain, the, strategic, initiative, the, iranians, suffered, from, a, shortage, of, heavy, weapons, 225, but, had, a, large, number, of, devoted, volunteer, troops, so, they, began, using, human, wave, attacks, against, the, iraqis, typically, an, iranian, assault, would, commence, with, poorly, trained, basij, who, would, launch, the, primary, human, wave, assaults, to, swamp, the, weakest, portions, of, the, iraqi, lines, en, masse, on, some, occasions, even, bodily, clearing, minefields, this, would, be, followed, up, by, the, more, experienced, revolutionary, guard, infantry, who, would, breach, the, weakened, iraqi, lines, and, followed, up, by, the, regular, army, using, mechanized, forces, who, would, maneuver, through, the, breach, and, attempt, to, encircle, and, defeat, the, enemy, according, to, historian, stephen, c, pelletiere, the, idea, of, iranian, human, wave, attacks, was, a, misconception, instead, the, iranian, tactics, consisted, of, using, groups, of, 22, man, infantry, squads, which, moved, forward, to, attack, specific, objectives, as, the, squads, surged, forward, to, execute, their, missions, that, gave, the, impression, of, a, human, wave, attack, nevertheless, the, idea, of, human, wave, attacks, remained, virtually, synonymous, with, any, large, scale, infantry, frontal, assault, iran, carried, out, large, numbers, of, troops, would, be, used, aimed, at, overwhelming, the, iraqi, lines, usually, the, weakest, portion, typically, manned, by, the, iraqi, popular, army, regardless, of, losses, according, to, the, former, iraqi, general, ra, ad, al, hamdani, the, iranian, human, wave, charges, consisted, of, armed, civilians, who, carried, most, of, their, necessary, equipment, themselves, into, battle, and, often, lacked, command, and, control, and, logistics, operations, were, often, carried, out, during, the, night, and, deception, operations, infiltrations, and, maneuvers, became, more, common, the, iranians, would, also, reinforce, the, infiltrating, forces, with, new, units, to, keep, up, their, momentum, once, a, weak, point, was, found, the, iranians, would, concentrate, all, of, their, forces, into, that, area, in, an, attempt, to, break, through, with, human, wave, attacks, the, human, wave, attacks, while, extremely, bloody, tens, of, thousands, of, troops, died, in, the, process, when, used, in, combination, with, infiltration, and, surprise, caused, major, iraqi, defeats, as, the, iraqis, would, dig, in, their, tanks, and, infantry, into, static, entrenched, positions, the, iranians, would, manage, to, break, through, the, lines, and, encircle, entire, divisions, merely, the, fact, that, the, iranian, forces, used, maneuver, warfare, by, their, light, infantry, against, static, iraqi, defenses, was, often, the, decisive, factor, in, battle, however, lack, of, coordination, between, the, iranian, army, and, irgc, and, shortages, of, heavy, weaponry, played, a, detrimental, role, often, with, most, of, the, infantry, not, being, supported, by, artillery, and, armor, after, the, iraqi, offensive, stalled, in, march, 1981, there, was, little, change, in, the, front, other, than, iran, retaking, the, high, ground, above, susangerd, in, may, by, late, 1981, iran, returned, to, the, offensive, and, launched, operation, samen, ol, a, emeh, the, eighth, imam, ending, the, iraqi, siege, of, abadan, on, 27, 29, september, 1981, 9, the, iranians, used, a, combined, force, of, regular, army, artillery, with, small, groups, of, armor, supported, by, pasdaran, irgc, and, basij, infantry, on, 15, october, after, breaking, the, siege, a, large, iranian, convoy, was, ambushed, by, iraqi, tanks, and, during, the, ensuing, tank, battle, iran, lost, 20, chieftains, and, other, armored, vehicles, and, withdrew, from, the, previously, gained, territory, on, 29, november, 1981, iran, began, operation, tariq, al, quds, with, three, army, brigades, and, seven, revolutionary, guard, brigades, the, iraqis, failed, to, properly, patrol, their, occupied, areas, and, the, iranians, constructed, a, 14, km, 14, 000, m, 8, 7, mi, road, through, the, unguarded, sand, dunes, launching, their, attack, from, the, iraqi, rear, the, town, of, bostan, was, retaken, from, iraqi, divisions, by, 7, december, 10, by, this, time, the, iraqi, army, was, experiencing, serious, morale, problems, compounded, by, the, fact, that, operation, tariq, al, quds, marked, the, first, use, of, iranian, human, wave, tactics, where, the, revolutionary, guard, light, infantry, repeatedly, charged, at, iraqi, positions, oftentimes, without, the, support, of, armour, or, air, power, the, fall, of, bostan, exacerbated, the, iraqis, logistical, problems, forcing, them, to, use, a, roundabout, route, from, ahvaz, to, the, south, to, resupply, their, troops, 6, 000, iranians, and, over, 2, 000, iraqis, were, killed, in, the, operation, the, iraqis, realising, that, the, iranians, were, planning, to, attack, decided, to, preempt, them, with, operation, al, fawz, al, azim, supreme, success, on, 19, march, using, a, large, number, of, tanks, helicopters, and, fighter, jets, they, attacked, the, iranian, buildup, around, the, roghabiyeh, pass, though, saddam, and, his, generals, assumed, they, had, succeeded, in, reality, the, iranian, forces, remained, fully, intact, the, iranians, had, concentrated, much, of, their, forces, by, bringing, them, directly, from, the, cities, and, towns, throughout, iran, via, trains, buses, and, private, cars, the, concentration, of, forces, did, not, resemble, a, traditional, military, buildup, and, although, the, iraqis, detected, a, population, buildup, near, the, front, they, failed, to, realize, that, this, was, an, attacking, force, as, a, result, saddam, s, army, was, unprepared, for, the, iranian, offensives, to, come, iran, s, next, major, offensive, led, by, then, colonel, ali, sayad, shirazi, was, operation, fath, ol, mobin, on, 22, march, 1982, iran, launched, an, attack, which, took, the, iraqi, forces, by, surprise, using, chinook, helicopters, they, landed, behind, iraqi, lines, silenced, their, artillery, and, captured, an, iraqi, headquarters, the, revolutionary, guard, and, regular, army, followed, up, by, surrounding, the, iraqi, 9th, and, 10th, armoured, and, 1st, mechanised, divisions, that, had, camped, close, to, the, iranian, town, of, shush, the, iraqis, launched, a, counter, attack, using, their, 12th, armoured, division, to, break, the, encirclement, and, rescue, the, surrounded, divisions, iraqi, tanks, came, under, attack, by, 95, iranian, f, 4, phantom, and, f, 5, tiger, fighter, jets, destroying, much, of, the, division, operation, fath, ol, mobin, was, an, iranian, victory, iraqi, forces, were, driven, away, from, shush, dezful, and, ahvaz, the, iranian, armed, forces, destroyed, 320, 400, iraqi, tanks, and, armored, vehicles, in, a, costly, success, in, just, the, first, day, of, the, battle, the, iranians, lost, 196, tanks, by, this, time, most, of, the, khuzestan, province, had, been, recaptured, in, preparation, for, operation, beit, ol, moqaddas, the, iranians, had, launched, numerous, air, raids, against, iraq, air, bases, destroying, 47, jets, including, iraq, s, brand, new, mirage, f, 1, fighter, jets, from, france, this, gave, the, iranians, air, superiority, over, the, battlefield, while, allowing, them, to, monitor, iraqi, troop, movements, on, 29, april, iran, launched, the, offensive, 70, 000, revolutionary, guard, and, basij, members, struck, on, several, axes, bostan, susangerd, the, west, bank, of, the, karun, river, and, ahvaz, the, basij, launched, human, wave, attacks, which, were, followed, up, by, the, regular, army, and, revolutionary, guard, support, along, with, tanks, and, helicopters, under, heavy, iranian, pressure, the, iraqi, forces, retreated, by, 12, may, iran, had, driven, out, all, iraqi, forces, from, the, susangerd, area, 36, the, iranians, captured, several, thousand, iraqi, troops, and, a, large, number, of, tanks, the, iraqis, retreated, to, the, karun, river, with, only, khorramshahr, and, a, few, outlying, areas, remaining, in, their, possession, saddam, ordered, 70, 000, troops, to, be, placed, around, the, city, of, khorramshahr, the, iraqis, created, a, hastily, constructed, defence, line, around, the, city, and, outlying, areas, to, discourage, airborne, commando, landings, the, iraqis, also, placed, metal, spikes, and, destroyed, cars, in, areas, likely, to, be, used, as, troop, landing, zones, saddam, hussein, even, visited, khorramshahr, in, a, dramatic, gesture, swearing, that, the, city, would, never, be, relinquished, however, khorramshahr, s, only, resupply, point, was, across, the, shatt, al, arab, and, the, iranian, air, force, began, bombing, the, supply, bridges, to, the, city, while, their, artillery, zeroed, in, on, the, besieged, garrison, in, the, early, morning, hours, of, 23, may, 1982, the, iranians, began, the, drive, towards, khorramshahr, across, the, karun, river, this, part, of, operation, beit, ol, moqaddas, was, spearheaded, by, the, 77th, khorasan, division, with, tanks, along, with, the, revolutionary, guard, and, basij, the, iranians, hit, the, iraqis, with, destructive, air, strikes, and, massive, artillery, barrages, crossed, the, karun, river, captured, bridgeheads, and, launched, human, wave, attacks, towards, the, city, saddam, s, defensive, barricade, collapsed, in, less, than, 48, hours, of, fighting, the, city, fell, and, 19, 000, iraqis, surrendered, to, the, iranians, a, total, of, 10, 000, iraqis, were, killed, or, wounded, in, khorramshahr, while, the, iranians, suffered, 30, 000, casualties, during, the, whole, of, operation, beit, ol, moqaddas, 33, 000, iraqi, soldiers, were, captured, by, the, iranians, the, fighting, had, battered, the, iraqi, military, its, strength, fell, from, 210, 000, to, 150, 000, troops, over, 20, 000, iraqi, soldiers, were, killed, and, over, 30, 000, captured, two, out, of, four, active, armoured, divisions, and, at, least, three, mechanised, divisions, fell, to, less, than, a, brigade, s, strength, and, the, iranians, had, captured, over, 450, tanks, and, armoured, personnel, carriers, the, iraqi, air, force, was, also, left, in, poor, shape, after, losing, up, to, 55, aircraft, since, early, december, 1981, they, had, only, 100, intact, fighter, bombers, and, interceptors, a, defector, who, flew, his, mig, 21, to, syria, in, june, 1982, revealed, that, the, iraqi, air, force, had, only, three, squadrons, of, fighter, bombers, capable, of, mounting, operations, into, iran, the, iraqi, army, air, corps, was, in, slightly, better, shape, and, could, still, operate, more, than, 70, helicopters, despite, this, the, iraqis, still, held, 3, 000, tanks, while, iran, held, 1, 000, at, this, point, saddam, believed, that, his, army, was, too, demoralised, and, damaged, to, hold, onto, khuzestan, and, major, swathes, of, iranian, territory, and, withdrew, his, remaining, forces, redeploying, them, in, defence, along, the, border, however, his, troops, continued, to, occupy, some, key, iranian, border, areas, of, iran, including, the, disputed, territories, that, prompted, his, invasion, notably, the, shatt, al, arab, waterway, in, response, to, their, failures, against, the, iranians, in, khorramshahr, saddam, ordered, the, executions, of, generals, juwad, shitnah, and, salah, al, qadhi, and, colonels, masa, and, al, jalil, at, least, a, dozen, other, high, ranking, officers, were, also, executed, during, this, time, this, became, an, increasingly, common, punishment, for, those, who, failed, him, in, battle, in, april, 1982, the, rival, ba, athist, regime, in, syria, one, of, the, few, nations, that, supported,

bankruptcy, by, providing, it, with, 37, 60, billion, in, loans, 263, though, iraq, had, previously, been, hostile, towards, other, gulf, states, the, threat, of, persian, fundamentalism, was, far, more, feared, 162, 163, 263, they, were, especially, inclined, to, fear, iranian, victory, after, ayatollah, khomeini, declared, monarchies, to, be, illegitimate, and, an, un, islamic, form, of, government, khomeini, s, statement, was, widely, received, as, a, call, to, overthrow, the, gulf, monarchies, journalists, john, bulloch, and, harvey, morris, wrote, the, virulent, iranian, campaign, which, at, its, peak, seemed, to, be, making, the, overthrow, of, the, saudi, regime, a, war, aim, on, a, par, with, the, defeat, of, iraq, did, have, an, effect, on, the, kingdom, but, not, the, one, the, iranians, wanted, instead, of, becoming, more, conciliatory, the, saudis, became, tougher, more, self, confident, and, less, prone, to, seek, compromise, 163, saudi, arabia, was, said, to, provide, iraq, with, 1, billion, per, month, starting, in, mid, 1982, 160, iraq, began, receiving, support, from, the, united, states, and, west, european, countries, as, well, saddam, was, given, diplomatic, monetary, and, military, support, by, the, united, states, including, massive, loans, political, influence, and, intelligence, on, iranian, deployments, gathered, by, american, spy, satellites, the, iraqis, relied, heavily, on, american, satellite, footage, and, radar, planes, to, detect, iranian, troop, movements, and, they, enabled, iraq, to, move, troops, to, the, site, before, the, battle, with, iranian, success, on, the, battlefield, the, united, states, increased, its, support, of, the, iraqi, government, supplying, intelligence, economic, aid, and, dual, use, equipment, and, vehicles, as, well, as, normalizing, its, intergovernmental, relations, which, had, been, broken, during, the, 1967, six, day, war, in, march, 1982, president, ronald, reagan, signed, national, security, study, memorandum, nssm, 4, 82, seeking, a, review, of, u, s, policy, toward, the, middle, east, and, in, june, reagan, signed, a, national, security, decision, directive, nsdd, co, written, by, nsc, official, howard, teicher, which, determined, the, united, states, could, not, afford, to, allow, iraq, to, lose, the, war, to, iran, and, that, the, united, states, would, do, whatever, was, necessary, to, prevent, iraq, from, losing, in, 1982, reagan, removed, iraq, from, the, list, of, countries, supporting, terrorism, and, sold, weapons, such, as, howitzers, to, iraq, via, jordan, france, sold, iraq, millions, of, dollars, worth, of, weapons, including, gazelle, helicopters, mirage, f, 1, fighters, and, exocet, missiles, both, the, united, states, and, west, germany, sold, iraq, dual, use, pesticides, and, poisons, that, would, be, used, to, create, chemical, weapons, iran, did, not, have, the, money, to, purchase, arms, to, the, same, extent, as, iraq, did, they, counted, on, china, north, korea, libya, syria, and, japan, for, supplying, anything, from, weapons, and, munitions, to, logistical, and, engineering, equipment, on, 20, june, 1982, saddam, announced, that, he, wanted, to, sue, for, peace, and, proposed, an, immediate, ceasefire, and, withdrawal, from, iranian, territory, within, two, weeks, khomeini, responded, by, saying, the, war, would, not, end, until, a, new, government, was, installed, in, iraq, and, reparations, paid, he, proclaimed, that, iran, would, invade, iraq, and, would, not, stop, until, the, ba, ath, regime, was,

ali, akbar, velayati, president, ali, khamenei, army, chief, of, staff, general, ali, sayad, shirazi, as, well, as, major, general, qasem, ali, zahirnejad, wanted, to, accept, the, ceasefire, as, most, of, iranian, soil, had, been, recaptured, in, particular, general, shirazi, and, zahirnejad, were, both, opposed, to, the, invasion, of, iraq, on, logistical, grounds, and, stated, they, would, consider, resigning, if, unqualified, people, continued, to, meddle, with, the, conduct, of, the, war, 38, of, the, opposing, view, was, a, hardline, faction, led, by, the, clerics, on, the, supreme,

captured, large, quantities, of, iraqi, equipment, enough, to, create, several, tank, battalions, iran, once, again, had, 1, 000, tanks, and, also, managed, to, clandestinely, procure, spare, parts, as, well, including, those, pertaining, to, the, f, 14, tomcat, at, a, cabinet, meeting, in, baghdad, minister, of, health, riyadh, ibrahim, hussein, suggested, that, saddam, could, step, down, temporarily, as, a, way, of, easing, iran, towards, a, ceasefire, and, then, afterwards, would, come, back, to, power, 147, saddam, annoyed, asked, if, anyone, else, in, the, cabinet, agreed, with, the, health, minister, s, idea, when, no, one, raised, their, hand, in, support, he, escorted, riyadh, hussein, to, the, next, room, closed, the, door, and, shot, him, with, his, pistol, 147, for, the, most, part, iraq, remained, on, the, defensive, for, the, next, five, years, unable, and, unwilling, to, launch, any, major, offensives, while, iran, launched, more, than, 70, offensives, iraq, s, strategy, changed, from, holding, territory, in, iran, to, denying, iran, any, major, gains, in, iraq, as, well, as, holding, onto, disputed, territories, along, the, border, saddam, began, a, policy, of, total, war, gearing, most, of, his, country, towards, defending, against, iran, by, 1988, iraq, was, spending, 40, 75, of, its, gdp, on, military, equipment, saddam, had, also, more, than, doubled, the, size, of, the, iraqi, army, from, 200, 000, soldiers, 12, divisions, and, three, independent, brigades, to, 500, 000, 23, divisions, and, nine, brigades, iraq, also, began, launching, air, raids, against, iranian, border, cities, greatly, increasing, the, practice, by, 1984, 2, by, the, end, of, 1982, iraq, had, been, resupplied, with, new, soviet, and, chinese, materiel, and, the, ground, war, entered, a, new, phase, iraq, used, newly, acquired, t, 55, t, 62, and, t, 72, tanks, as, well, as, chinese, copies, bm, 21, truck, mounted, rocket, launchers, and, mi, 24, helicopter, gunships, to, prepare, a, soviet, type, three, line, defence, replete, with, obstacles, such, as, barbed, wire, minefields, fortified, positions, and, bunkers, the, combat, engineer, corps, built, bridges, across, water, obstacles, laid, minefields, erected, earthen, revetments, dug, trenches, built, machine, gun, nests, and, prepared, new, defence, lines, and, fortifications, 2, iraq, began, to, focus, on, using, defense, in, depth, to, defeat, the, iranians, iraq, created, multiple, static, defense, lines, to, bleed, the, iranians, through, sheer, size, when, faced, against, large, iranian, attack, where, human, waves, would, overrun, iraq, s, forward, entrenched, infantry, defences, the, iraqis, would, often, retreat, but, their, static, defences, would, bleed, the, iranians, and, channel, them, into, certain, directions, drawing, them, into, traps, or, pockets, iraqi, air, and, artillery, attacks, would, then, pin, the, iranians, down, while, tanks, and, mechanised, infantry, attacks, using, mobile, warfare, would, push, them, back, sometimes, the, iraqis, would, launch, probing, attacks, into, the, iranian, lines, to, provoke, them, into, launching, their, attacks, sooner, while, iranian, human, wave, attacks, were, successful, against, the, dug, in, iraqi, forces, in, khuzestan, they, had, trouble, breaking, through, iraq, s, defense, in, depth, lines, iraq, had, a, logistical, advantage, in, their, defence, the, front, was, located, near, the, main, iraqi, bases, and, arms, depots, allowing, their, army, to, be, efficiently, supplied, 260, 265, by, contrast, the, front, in, iran, was, a, considerable, distance, away, from, the, main, iranian, bases, and, arms, depots, and, as, such, iranian, troops, and, supplies, had, to, travel, through, mountain, ranges, before, arriving, at, the, front, 260, iran, s, military, power, was, weakened, once, again, by, large, purges, in, 1982, resulting, from, another, supposedly, attempted, coup, the, iranian, generals, wanted, to, launch, an, all, out, attack, on, baghdad, and, seize, it, while, the, iranian, army, s, supplies, allowed, for, such, an, offensive, this, was, rejected, as, being, impracticable, and, the, decision, was, made, to, capture, one, area, of, iraq, after, the, other, with, the, hope, that, this, would, force, iraq, to, withdraw, from, disputed, border, territories, and, begin, negotiations, to, end, the, war, on, 13, july, 1982, iran, began, their, attack, in, southern, iraq, near, basra, called, operation, ramadan, it, involved, over, 180, 000, troops, from, both, sides, and, was, one, of, the, largest, land, battles, since, world, war, ii, 3, iranian, strategy, dictated, that, they, launch, their, primary, attack, on, the, weakest, point, of, the, iraqi, lines, however, the, iraqis, were, informed, of, iran, s, battle, plans, and, moved, all, of, their, forces, to, the, area, the, iranians, planned, to, attack, the, iraqis, were, equipped, with, tear, gas, to, use, against, the, enemy, which, was, the, first, major, use, of, chemical, warfare, during, the, conflict, throwing, an, entire, attacking, division, into, chaos, over, 100, 000, revolutionary, guards, and, basij, volunteer, forces, charged, towards, the, iraqi, lines, the, iraqi, troops, had, entrenched, themselves, in, formidable, defenses, and, had, set, up, a, network, of, bunkers, and, artillery, positions, the, basij, used, human, waves, and, were, even, used, to, bodily, clear, the, iraqi, minefields, and, allow, the, revolutionary, guards, to, advance, combatants, came, so, close, to, one, another, that, iranians, were, able, to, board, iraqi, tanks, and, throw, grenades, inside, the, hulls, by, the, eighth, day, the, iranians, had, gained, 16, km, 9, 9, mi, inside, iraq, and, had, taken, several, causeways, iran, s, revolutionary, guards, also, used, the, t, 55, tanks, they, had, captured, in, earlier, battles, the, attacks, came, to, a, halt, and, the, iranians, turned, to, defensive, measures, seeing, this, iraq, used, their, mi, 25, helicopters, along, with, gazelle, helicopters, armed, with, euromissile, hot, against, columns, of, iranian, mechanised, infantry, and, tanks, these, hunter, killer, teams, of, helicopters, which, had, been, formed, with, the, help, of, east, german, advisors, proved, very, costly, for, the, iranians, aerial, dogfights, occurred, between, iraqi, migs, and, iranian, f, 4, phantoms, on, 16, july, iran, tried, again, further, north, and, managed, to, push, the, iraqis, back, only, 13, km, 8, 1, mi, from, basra, the, poorly, equipped, iranian, forces, were, surrounded, on, three, sides, by, iraqis, with, heavy, weaponry, some, were, captured, while, many, were, killed, only, a, last, minute, attack, by, iranian, ah, 1, cobra, helicopters, stopped, the, iraqis, from, routing, the, iranians, three, more, similar, attacks, occurred, around, the, khorramshahr, baghdad, road, area, towards, the, end, of, the, month, but, none, were, significantly, successful, iraq, had, concentrated, three, armoured, divisions, the, 3rd, 9th, and, 10th, as, a, counter, attack, force, to, attack, any, penetrations, they, were, successful, in, defeating, the, iranian, breakthroughs, but, suffered, heavy, losses, the, 9th, armoured, division, in, particular, had, to, be, disbanded, and, was, never, reformed, the, total, casualty, toll, had, grown, to, include, 80, 000, soldiers, and, civilians, 400, iranian, tanks, and, armored, vehicles, were, destroyed, or, abandoned, while, iraq, lost, at, least, 370, tanks, after, iran, s, failure, in, operation, ramadan, they, carried, out, only, a, few, smaller, attacks, iran, launched, two, limited, offensives, aimed, at, reclaiming, the, sumar, hills, and, isolating, the, iraqi, pocket, at, naft, shahr, at, the, international, border, both, of, which, were, part, of, the, disputed, territories, still, under, iraqi, occupation, they, then, aimed, to, capture, the, iraqi, border, town, of, mandali, they, planned, to, take, the, iraqis, by, surprise, using, basij, militiamen, army, helicopters, and, some, armoured, forces, then, stretch, their, defences, and, possibly, break, through, them, to, open, a, road, to, baghdad, for, future, exploitation, during, operation, muslim, ibn, aqil, 1, 7, october, iran, recovered, 150, km, 2, 58, sq, mi, of, disputed, territory, straddling, the, international, border, and, reached, the, outskirts, of, mandali, before, being, stopped, by, iraqi, helicopter, and, armoured, attacks, during, operation, muharram, 1, 21, november, the, iranians, captured, part, of, the, bayat, oilfield, with, the, help, of, their, fighter, jets, and, helicopters, destroying, 105, iraqi, tanks, 70, apcs, and, 7, planes, with, few, losses, they, nearly, breached, the, iraqi, lines, but, failed, to, capture, mandali, after, the, iraqis, sent, reinforcements, including, brand, new, t, 72, tanks, which, possessed, armour, that, could, not, be, pierced, from, the, front, by, iranian, tow, missiles, the, iranian, advance, was, also, impeded, by, heavy, rains, 3, 500, iraqis, and, an, unknown, number, of, iranians, died, with, only, minor, gains, for, iran, after, the, failure, of, the, 1982, summer, offensives, iran, believed, that, a, major, effort, along, the, entire, breadth, of, the, front, would, yield, victory, in, 1983, the, iranians, launched, five, major, assaults, along, the, front, none, achieved, substantial, success, as, the, iranians, staged, more, massive, human, wave, attacks, by, this, time, it, was, estimated, that, no, more, than, 70, iranian, fighter, aircraft, were, still, operational, at, any, given, time, iran, had, its, own, helicopter, repair, facilities, left, over, from, before, the, revolution, and, often, used, helicopters, for, close, air, support, iranian, fighter, pilots, had, superior, training, compared, to, their, iraqi, counterparts, as, most, had, received, training, from, us, officers, before, the, 1979, revolution, and, continued, to, dominate, in, combat, however, aircraft, shortages, the, size, of, defended, territory, airspace, and, american, intelligence, supplied, to, iraq, allowed, the, iraqis, to, exploit, gaps, in, iranian, airspace, iraqi, air, campaigns, met, little, opposition, striking, over, half, of, iran, as, the, iraqis, were, able, to, gain, air, superiority, towards, the, end, of, the, war, in, operation, before, the, dawn, launched, 6, february, 1983, the, iranians, shifted, focus, from, the, southern, to, the, central, and, northern, sectors, employing, 200, 000, last, reserve, revolutionary, guard, troops, iran, attacked, along, a, 40, km, 25, mi, stretch, near, al, amarah, iraq, about, 200, km, 120, mi, southeast, of, baghdad, in, an, attempt, to, reach, the, highways, connecting, northern, and, southern, iraq, the, attack, was, stalled, by, 60, km, 37, mi, of, hilly, escarpments, forests, and, river, torrents, blanketing, the, way, to, al, amarah, but, the, iraqis, could, not, force, the, iranians, back, iran, directed, artillery, on, basra, al, amarah, and, mandali, the, iranians, suffered, a, large, number, of, casualties, clearing, minefields, and, breaching, iraqi, anti, tank, mines, which, iraqi, engineers, were, unable, to, replace, after, this, battle, iran, reduced, its, use, of, human, wave, attacks, though, they, still, remained, a, key, tactic, as, the, war, went, on, further, iranian, attacks, were, mounted, in, the, mandali, baghdad, north, central, sector, in, april, 1983, but, were, repelled, by, iraqi, mechanised, and, infantry, divisions, casualties, were, high, and, by, the, end, of, 1983, an, estimated, 120, 000, iranians, and, 60, 000, iraqis, had, been, killed, iran, held, the, advantage, in, the, war, of, attrition, in, 1983, iran, had, an, estimated, population, of, 43, 6, million, to, iraq, s, 14, 8, million, and, the, discrepancy, continued, to, grow, throughout, the, war, 2, from, early, 1983, 1984, iran, launched, a, series, of, four, valfajr, dawn, operations, that, eventually, numbered, to, 10, during, operation, dawn, 1, in, early, february, 1983, 50, 000, iranian, forces, attacked, westward, from, dezful, and, were, confronted, by, 55, 000, iraqi, forces, the, iranian, objective, was, to, cut, off, the, road, from, basra, to, baghdad, in, the, central, sector, the, iraqis, carried, out, 150, air, sorties, against, the, iranians, and, even, bombed, dezful, ahvaz, and, khorramshahr, in, retribution, the, iraqi, counterattack, was, broken, up, by, iran, s, 92nd, armoured, division, during, operation, dawn, 2, the, iranians, directed, insurgency, operations, by, proxy, in, april, 1983, by, supporting, the, kurds, in, the, north, with, kurdish, support, the, iranians, attacked, on, 23, july, 1983, capturing, the, iraqi, town, of, haj, omran, and, maintaining, it, against, an, iraqi, poison, gas, counteroffensive, this, operation, incited, iraq, to, later, conduct, indiscriminate, chemical, attacks, against, the, kurds, the, iranians, attempted, to, further, exploit, activities, in, the, north, on, 30, july, 1983, during, operation, dawn, 3, iran, saw, an, opportunity, to, sweep, away, iraqi, forces, controlling, the, roads, between, the, iranian, mountain, border, towns, of, mehran, dehloran, and, elam, iraq, launched, airstrikes, and, equipped, attack, helicopters, with, chemical, warheads, while, ineffective, it, demonstrated, both, the, iraqi, general, staff, s, and, saddam, s, increasing, interest, in, using, chemical, weapons, in, the, end, 17, 000, had, been, killed, on, both, sides, with, no, gain, for, either, country, the, focus, of, operation, dawn, 4, in, september, 1983, was, the, northern, sector, in, iranian, kurdistan, three, iranian, regular, divisions, the, revolutionary, guard, and, kurdistan, democratic, party, kdp, elements, amassed, in, marivan, and, sardasht, in, a, move, to, threaten, the, major, iraqi, city, suleimaniyah, iran, s, strategy, was, to, press, kurdish, tribes, to, occupy, the, banjuin, valley, which, was, within, 45, km, 28, mi, of, suleimaniyah, and, 140, km, 87, mi, from, the, oilfields, of, kirkuk, to, stem, the, tide, iraq, deployed, mi, 8, attack, helicopters, equipped, with, chemical, weapons, and, executed, 120, sorties, against, the, iranian, force, which, stopped, them, 15, km, 9, 3, mi, into, iraqi, territory, 5, 000, iranians, and, 2, 500, iraqis, died, iran, gained, 110, km, 2, 42, sq, mi, of, its, territory, back, in, the, north, gained, 15, km, 2, 5, 8, sq, mi, of, iraqi, land, and, captured, 1, 800, iraqi, prisoners, while, iraq, abandoned, large, quantities, of, valuable, weapons, and, war, materiel, in, the, field, iraq, responded, to, these, losses, by, firing, a, series, of, scud, b, missiles, into, the, cities, of, dezful, masjid, soleiman, and, behbehan, iran, s, use, of, artillery, against, basra, while, the, battles, in, the, north, raged, created, multiple, fronts, which, effectively, confused, and, wore, down, iraq, previously, the, iranians, had, outnumbered, the, iraqis, on, the, battlefield, but, iraq, expanded, their, military, draft, pursuing, a, policy, of, total, war, and, by, 1984, the, armies, were, equal, in, size, by, 1986, iraq, had, twice, as, many, soldiers, as, iran, by, 1988, iraq, had, 1, million, soldiers, giving, it, the, fourth, largest, army, in, the, world, some, of, its, equipment, such, as, tanks, outnumbered, iran, s, by, at, least, five, to, one, iranian, commanders, however, remained, more, tactically, skilled, after, the, dawn, operations, iran, attempted, to, change, tactics, in, the, face, of, increasing, iraqi, defense, in, depth, as, well, as, increased, armaments, and, manpower, iran, could, no, longer, rely, on, simple, human, wave, attacks, iranian, offensives, became, more, complex, and, involved, extensive, maneuver, warfare, using, primarily, light, infantry, iran, launched, frequent, and, sometimes, smaller, offensives, to, slowly, gain, ground, and, deplete, the, iraqis, through, attrition, they, wanted, to, drive, iraq, into, economic, failure, by, wasting, money, on, weapons, and, war, mobilization, and, to, deplete, their, smaller, population, by, bleeding, them, dry, in, addition, to, creating, an, anti, government, insurgency, they, were, successful, in, kurdistan, but, not, southern, iraq, iran, supported, their, attacks, with, heavy, weaponry, when, possible, and, with, better, planning, although, the, brunt, of, the, battles, still, fell, to, the, infantry, the, army, and, revolutionary, guards, worked, together, better, as, their, tactics, improved, human, wave, attacks, became, less, frequent, although, were, still, used, to, negate, the, iraqi, advantage, of, defense, in, depth, static, positions, and, heavy, firepower, iran, began, to, focus, on, fighting, in, areas, where, the, iraqis, could, not, use, their, heavy, weaponry, such, as, marshes, valleys, and, mountains, and, frequently, using, infiltration, tactics, iran, began, training, troops, in, infiltration, patrolling, night, fighting, marsh, warfare, and, mountain, warfare, they, began, training, thousands, of, revolutionary, guard, commandos, in, amphibious, warfare, as, southern, iraq, is, marshy, and, filled, with, wetlands, iran, used, speedboats, to, cross, the, marshes, and, rivers, in, southern, iraq, and, landed, troops, on, the, opposing, banks, where, they, would, dig, and, set, up, pontoon, bridges, across, the, rivers, and, wetlands, to, allow, heavy, troops, and, supplies, to, cross, iran, also, learned, to, integrate, foreign, guerrilla, units, as, part, of, their, military, operations, on, the, northern, front, iran, began, working, heavily, with, the, peshmerga, kurdish, guerrillas, iranian, military, advisors, organised, the, kurds, into, raiding, parties, of, 12, guerrillas, which, would, attack, iraqi, command, posts, troop, formations, infrastructure, including, roads, and, supply, lines, and, government, buildings, the, oil, refineries, of, kirkuk, became, a, favourite, target, and, were, often, hit, by, homemade, peshmerga, rockets, by, 1984, the, iranian, ground, forces, were, reorganised, well, enough, for, the, revolutionary, guard, to, start, operation, kheibar, which, lasted, from, 24, february, to, 19, march, 171, on, 15, february, 1984, the, iranians, began, launching, attacks, against, the, central, section, of, the, front, where, the, second, iraqi, army, corps, was, deployed, 250, 000, iraqis, faced, 250, 000, iranians, the, goal, of, this, new, major, offensive, was, the, capture, of, basra, baghdad, highway, cutting, off, basra, from, baghdad, and, setting, the, stage, for, an, eventual, attack, upon, the, city, the, iraqi, high, command, had, assumed, that, the, marshlands, above, basra, were, natural, barriers, to, attack, and, had, not, reinforced, them, the, marshes, negated, iraqi, advantage, in, armor, and, absorbed, artillery, rounds, and, bombs, prior, to, the, attack, iranian, commandos, on, helicopters, had, landed, behind, iraqi, lines, and, destroyed, iraqi, artillery, iran, launched, two, preliminary, attacks, prior, to, the, main, offensive, operation, dawn, 5, and, dawn, 6, operation, kheibar, began, on, 24, february, with, iranian, infantrymen, crossing, the, hawizeh, marshes, using, motorboats, and, transport, helicopters, in, an, amphibious, assault, the, iranians, attacked, the, vital, oil, producing, majnoon, island, by, landing, troops, via, helicopters, onto, the, islands, and, severing, the, communication, lines, between, amareh, and, basra, they, then, continued, the, attack, towards, qurna, by, 27, february, they, had, captured, the, island, but, suffered, catastrophic, helicopter, losses, to, the, iraf, on, that, day, a, massive, array, of, iranian, helicopters, transporting, pasdaran, troops, were, intercepted, by, iraqi, combat, aircraft, migs, mirages, and, sukhois, in, what, was, essentially, an, aerial, slaughter, iraqi, jets, shot, down, 49, of, the, 50, iranian, helicopters, at, times, fighting, took, place, in, waters, over, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, deep, iraq, ran, live, electrical, cables, through, the, water, electrocuting, numerous, iranian, troops, and, then, displaying, their, corpses, on, state, television, by, 29, february, the, iranians, had, reached, the, outskirts, of, qurna, and, were, closing, in, on, the, baghdad, basra, highway, they, had, broken, out, of, the, marshes, and, returned, to, open, terrain, where, they, were, confronted, by, iraqi, artillery, tanks, air, power, and, mustard, gas, 1, 200, iranian, soldiers, were, killed, in, the, counter, attack, the, iranians, retreated, back, to, the, marshes, though, they, still, held, onto, them, along, with, majnoon, island, 44, the, battle, of, the, marshes, saw, an, iraqi, defence, that, had, been, under, continuous, strain, since, 15, february, they, were, relieved, by, their, use, of, chemical, weapons, and, defence, in, depth, where, they, layered, defensive, lines, even, if, the, iranians, broke, through, the, first, line, they, were, usually, unable, to, break, through, the, second, due, to, exhaustion, and, heavy, losses, 171, they, largely, relied, on, mi, 24, hind, to, hunt, the, iranian, troops, in, the, marshes, at, least, 20, 000, iranians, were, killed, in, the, marsh, battles, iran, used, the, marshes, as, a, springboard, for, future, attacks, infiltrations, four, years, into, the, war, the, human, cost, to, iran, had, been, 170, 000, combat, fatalities, and, 340, 000, wounded, iraqi, combat, fatalities, were, estimated, at, 80, 000, with, 150, 000, wounded, unable, to, launch, successful, ground, attacks, against, iran, iraq, used, their, now, expanded, air, force, to, carry, out, strategic, bombing, against, iranian, shipping, economic, targets, and, cities, in, order, to, damage, iran, s, economy, and, morale, iraq, also, wanted, to, provoke, iran, into, doing, something, that, would, cause, the, superpowers, to, be, directly, involved, in, the, conflict, on, the, iraqi, side, the, so, called, tanker, war, started, when, iraq, attacked, the, oil, terminal, and, oil, tankers, at, kharg, island, in, early, 1984, iraq, s, aim, in, attacking, iranian, shipping, was, to, provoke, the, iranians, to, retaliate, with, extreme, measures, such, as, closing, the, strait, of, hormuz, to, all, maritime, traffic, thereby, bringing, american, intervention, the, united, states, had, threatened, several, times, to, intervene, if, the, strait, of, hormuz, were, closed, as, a, result, the, iranians, limited, their, retaliatory, attacks, to, iraqi, shipping, leaving, the, strait, open, to, general, passage, iraq, declared, that, all, ships, going, to, or, from, iranian, ports, in, the, northern, zone, of, the, persian, gulf, were, subject, to, attack, they, used, f, 1, mirage, super, etendard, mig, 23, su, 20, 22, and, super, frelon, helicopters, armed, with, exocet, anti, ship, missiles, as, well, as, soviet, made, air, to, surface, missiles, to, enforce, their, threats, iraq, repeatedly, bombed, iran, s, main, oil, export, facility, on, kharg, island, causing, increasingly, heavy, damage, as, a, first, response, to, these, attacks, iran, attacked, a, kuwaiti, tanker, carrying, iraqi, oil, near, bahrain, on, 13, may, 1984, as, well, as, a, saudi, tanker, in, saudi, waters, on, 16, may, because, iraq, had, become, landlocked, during, the, course, of, the, war, they, had, to, rely, on, their, arab, allies, primarily, kuwait, to, transport, their, oil, iran, attacked, tankers, carrying, iraqi, oil, from, kuwait, later, attacking, tankers, from, any, persian, gulf, state, supporting, iraq, attacks, on, ships, of, noncombatant, nations, in, the, persian, gulf, sharply, increased, thereafter, with, both, nations, attacking, oil, tankers, and, merchant, ships, of, neutral, nations, in, an, effort, to, deprive, their, opponent, of, trade, the, iranian,

persian, gulf, state, economies, and, iran, moved, its, shipping, port, to, larak, island, in, the, strait, of, hormuz, the, iranian, navy, imposed, a, naval, blockade, of, iraq, using, its, british, built, frigates, to, stop, and, inspect, any, ships, thought, to, be, trading, with, iraq, they, operated, with, virtual, impunity, as, iraqi, pilots, had, little, training, in, hitting, naval, targets, some, iranian, warships, attacked, tankers, with, ship, to, ship, missiles, while, others, used, their, radars, to, guide, land, based, anti, ship, missiles, to, their, targets, iran, began, to, rely, on, its, new, revolutionary, guard, s, navy, which, used, boghammar, speedboats, fitted, with, rocket, launchers, and, heavy, machine, guns, these, speedboats, would, launch, surprise, attacks, against, tankers, and, cause, substantial, damage, iran, also, used, f, 4, phantom, ii, fighters, and, helicopters, to, launch, maverick, missiles, and, unguided, rockets, at, tankers, a, u, s, navy, ship, stark, was, struck, on, 17, may, 1987, by, two, exocet, anti, ship, missiles, fired, from, an, iraqi, f, 1, mirage, plane, the, missiles, had, been, fired, at, about, the, time, the, plane, was, given, a, routine, radio, warning, by, stark, the, frigate, did, not, detect, the, missiles, with, radar, and, warning, was, given, by, the, lookout, only, moments, before, they, struck, both, missiles, hit, the, ship, and, one, exploded, in, crew, quarters, killing, 37, sailors, and, wounding, 21, lloyd, s, of, london, a, british, insurance, market, estimated, that, the, tanker, war, damaged, 546, commercial, vessels, and, killed, about, 430, civilian, sailors, the, largest, portion, of, the, attacks, was, directed, by, iraq, against, vessels, in, iranian, waters, with, the, iraqis, launching, three, times, as, many, attacks, as, the, iranians, 3, but, iranian, speedboat, attacks, on, kuwaiti, shipping, led, kuwait, to, formally, petition, foreign, powers, on, 1, november, 1986, to, protect, its, shipping, the, soviet, union, agreed, to, charter, tankers, starting, in, 1987, and, the, united, states, navy, offered, to, provide, protection, for, foreign, tankers, reflagged, and, flying, the, u, s, flag, starting, 7, march, 1987, in, operation, earnest, will, neutral, tankers, shipping, to, iran, were, not, protected, by, earnest, will, resulting, in, reduced, foreign, tanker, traffic, to, iran, since, they, risked, iraqi, air, attack, iran, accused, the, united, states, of, helping, iraq, during, the, course, of, the, war, iran, attacked, two, soviet, merchant, ships, seawise, giant, the, largest, ship, ever, built, was, struck, by, iraqi, exocet, missiles, as, it, was, carrying, iranian, crude, oil, out, of, the, persian, gulf, meanwhile, iraq, s, air, force, also, began, carrying, out, strategic, bombing, raids, against, iranian, cities, while, iraq, had, launched, numerous, attacks, with, aircraft, and, missiles, against, border, cities, from, the, beginning, of, the, war, and, sporadic, raids, on, iran, s, main, cities, this, was, the, first, systematic, strategic, bombing, that, iraq, carried, out, during, the, war, this, would, become, known, as, the, war, of, the, cities, with, the, help, of, the, ussr, and, the, west, iraq, s, air, force, had, been, rebuilt, and, expanded, meanwhile, iran, due, to, sanctions, and, lack, of, spare, parts, had, heavily, curtailed, its, air, force, operations, iraq, used, tu, 22, blinder, and, tu, 16, badger, strategic, bombers, to, carry, out, long, range, high, speed, raids, on, iranian, cities, including, tehran, fighter, bombers, such, as, the, mig, 25, foxbat, and, su, 22, fitter, were, used, against, smaller, or, shorter, range, targets, as, well, as, escorting, the, strategic, bombers, civilian, and, industrial, targets, were, hit, by, the, raids, and, each, successful, raid, inflicted, economic, damage, from, regular, strategic, bombing, in, response, the, iranians, deployed, their, f, 4, phantoms, to, combat, the, iraqis, and, eventually, they, deployed, f, 14s, as, well, by, 1986, iran, also, expanded, their, air, defense, network, heavily, to, relieve, the, pressure, on, the, air, force, by, later, in, the, war, iraqi, air, attacks, were, used, only, on, fewer, more, important, targets, starting, in, 1987, saddam, also, ordered, several, chemical, attacks, on, civilian, targets, in, iran, such, as, the, town, of, sardasht, iran, also, launched, several, retaliatory, air, raids, on, iraq, while, primarily, shelling, border, cities, such, as, basra, iran, also, bought, some, scud, missiles, from, libya, and, launched, them, against, baghdad, these, too, inflicted, damage, upon, iraq, on, 7, february, 1984, during, the, first, war, of, the, cities, saddam, ordered, his, air, force, to, attack, eleven, iranian, cities, bombardments, ceased, on, 22, february, 1984, it, was, estimated, that, 1, 200, iranian, civilians, were, killed, during, the, raids, in, february, alone, by, 1984, iran, s, losses, were, estimated, to, be, 300, 000, soldiers, while, iraq, s, losses, were, estimated, to, be, 150, 000, 2, foreign, analysts, agreed, that, both, iran, and, iraq, failed, to, use, their, modern, equipment, properly, and, both, sides, failed, to, carry, out, modern, military, assaults, that, could, win, the, war, both, sides, also, abandoned, equipment, in, the, battlefield, because, their, technicians, were, unable, to, carry, out, repairs, iran, and, iraq, showed, little, internal, coordination, on, the, battlefield, and, in, many, cases, units, were, left, to, fight, on, their, own, as, a, result, by, the, end, of, 1984, the, war, was, a, stalemate, 2, one, limited, offensive, iran, launched, dawn, 7, took, place, from, 18, to, 25, october, 1984, when, they, recaptured, the, iranian, city, of, mehran, which, had, been, occupied, by, the, iraqis, from, the, beginning, of, the, war, by, 1985, iraqi, armed, forces, were, receiving, financial, support, from, saudi, arabia, kuwait, and, other, persian, gulf, states, and, were, making, substantial, arms, purchases, from, the, soviet, union, china, and, france, for, the, first, time, since, early, 1980, saddam, launched, new, offensives, on, 6, january, 1986, the, iraqis, launched, an, offensive, attempting, to, retake, majnoon, island, they, were, quickly, bogged, down, into, a, stalemate, against, 200, 000, iranian, infantrymen, reinforced, by, amphibious, divisions, however, they, managed, to, gain, a, foothold, in, the, southern, part, of, the, island, iraq, also, carried, out, another, war, of, the, cities, between, 12, and, 14, march, hitting, up, to, 158, targets, in, over, 30, towns, and, cities, including, tehran, iran, responded, by, launching, 14, scud, missiles, for, the, first, time, purchased, from, libya, more, iraqi, air, attacks, were, carried, out, in, august, resulting, in, hundreds, of, additional, civilian, casualties, iraqi, attacks, against, both, iranian, and, neutral, oil, tankers, in, iranian, waters, continued, with, iraq, carrying, out, 150, airstrikes, using, french, bought, super, etendard, and, mirage, f, 1, jets, as, well, as, super, frelon, helicopters, armed, with, exocet, missiles, the, iraqis, attacked, again, on, 28, january, 1985, they, were, defeated, and, the, iranians, retaliated, on, 11, march, 1985, with, a, major, offensive, directed, against, the, baghdad, basra, highway, one, of, the, few, major, offensives, conducted, in, 1985, codenamed, operation, badr, after, the, battle, of, badr, muhammad, s, first, military, victory, in, mecca, ayatollah, khomeini, urged, iranians, on, declaring, it, is, our, belief, that, saddam, wishes, to, return, islam, to, blasphemy, and, polytheism, if, america, becomes, victorious, and, grants, victory, to, saddam, islam, will, receive, such, a, blow, that, it, will, not, be, able, to, raise, its, head, for, a, long, time, the, issue, is, one, of, islam, versus, blasphemy, and, not, of, iran, versus, iraq, this, operation, was, similar, to, operation, kheibar, though, it, invoked, more, planning, iran, used, 100, 000, troops, with, 60, 000, more, in, reserve, they, assessed, the, marshy, terrain, plotted, points, where, they, could, land, tanks, and, constructed, pontoon, bridges, across, the, marshes, the, basij, forces, were, also, equipped, with, anti, tank, weapons, the, ferocity, of, the, iranian, offensive, broke, through, the, iraqi, lines, the, revolutionary, guard, with, the, support, of, tanks, and, artillery, broke, through, north, of, qurna, on, 14, march, that, same, night, 3, 000, iranian, troops, reached, and, crossed, the, tigris, river, using, pontoon, bridges, and, captured, part, of, the, baghdad, basra, highway, 6, which, they, had, failed, to, achieve, in, operations, dawn, 5, and, 6, saddam, responded, by, launching, chemical, attacks, against, the, iranian, positions, along, the, highway, and, by, initiating, the, aforementioned, second, war, of, the, cities, with, an, air, and, missile, campaign, against, twenty, to, thirty, iranian, population, centres, including, tehran, under, general, sultan, hashim, ahmad, al, tai, and, general, jamal, zanoun, both, considered, to, be, among, iraq, s, most, skilled, commanders, the, iraqis, launched, air, attacks, against, the, iranian, positions, and, pinned, them, down, they, then, launched, a, pincer, attack, using, mechanized, infantry, and, heavy, artillery, chemical, weapons, were, used, and, the, iraqis, also, flooded, iranian, trenches, with, specially, constructed, pipes, delivering, water, from, the, tigris, river, the, iranians, retreated, back, to, the, hoveyzeh, marshes, while, being, attacked, by, helicopters, and, the, highway, was, recaptured, by, the, iraqis, operation, badr, resulted, in, 10, 000, 12, 000, iraqi, casualties, and, 15, 000, iranian, ones, the, failure, of, the, human, wave, attacks, in, earlier, years, had, prompted, iran, to, develop, a, better, working, relationship, between, the, army, and, the, revolutionary, guard, and, to, mould, the, revolutionary, guard, units, into, a, more, conventional, fighting, force, to, combat, iraq, s, use, of, chemical, weapons, iran, began, producing, an, antidote, they, also, created, and, fielded, their, own, homemade, drones, the, mohajer, 1, s, fitted, with, six, rpg, 7, s, to, launch, attacks, they, were, primarily, used, in, observation, being, used, for, up, to, 700, sorties, for, the, rest, of, 1986, and, until, the, spring, of, 1988, the, iranian, air, force, s, efficiency, in, air, defence, increased, with, weapons, being, repaired, or, replaced, and, new, tactical, methods, being, used, for, example, the, iranians, would, loosely, integrate, their, sam, sites, and, interceptors, to, create, killing, fields, in, which, dozens, of, iraqi, planes, were, lost, which, was, reported, in, the, west, as, the, iranian, air, force, using, f, 14s, as, mini, awacs, the, iraqi, air, force, reacted, by, increasing, the, sophistication, of, its, equipment, incorporating, modern, electronic, countermeasure, pods, decoys, such, as, chaff, and, flare, and, anti, radiation, missiles, due, to, the, heavy, losses, in, the, last, war, of, the, cities, iraq, reduced, their, use, of, aerial, attacks, on, iranian, cities, instead, they, launched, scud, missiles, which, the, iranians, could, not, stop, since, the, range, of, the, scud, missile, was, too, short, to, reach, tehran, they, converted, them, to, al, husayn, missiles, with, the, help, of, east, german, engineers, cutting, up, their, scuds, into, three, chunks, and, attaching, them, together, iran, responded, to, these, attacks, by, using, their, own, scud, missiles, compounding, the, extensive, foreign, help, to, iraq, iranian, attacks, were, severely, hampered, by, their, shortages, of, weaponry, particularly, heavy, weapons, as, large, amounts, had, been, lost, during, the, war, iran, still, managed, to, maintain, 1, 000, tanks, often, by, capturing, iraqi, ones, and, additional, artillery, but, many, needed, repairs, to, be, operational, by, this, time, iran, managed, to, procure, spare, parts, from, various, sources, helping, them, to, restore, some, weapons, they, secretly, imported, some, weapons, such, as, rbs, 70, anti, aircraft, manpads, in, an, exception, to, the, united, states, support, for, iraq, in, exchange, for, iran, using, its, influence, to, help, free, western, hostages, in, lebanon, the, united, states, secretly, sold, iran, some, limited, supplies, in, akbar, rafsanjani, s, postwar, interview, he, stated, that, during, the, period, when, iran, was, succeeding, for, a, short, time, the, united, states, supported, iran, then, shortly, after, began, helping, iraq, again, iran, managed, to, get, some, advanced, weapons, such, as, anti, tank, tow, missiles, which, worked, better, than, rocket, propelled, grenades, iran, later, reverse, engineered, and, produced, those, weapons, themselves, all, of, these, almost, certainly, helped, increase, the, effectiveness, of, iran, although, it, did, not, reduce, the, human, cost, of, their, attacks, on, the, night, of, 10, 11, february, 1986, the, iranians, launched, operation, dawn, 8, in, which, 30, 000, troops, in, five, army, divisions, and, men, from, the, revolutionary, guard, and, basij, advanced, in, a, two, pronged, offensive, to, capture, the, al, faw, peninsula, in, southern, iraq, the, only, area, touching, the, persian, gulf, the, capture, of, al, faw, and, umm, qasr, was, a, major, goal, for, iran, iran, began, with, a, feint, attack, against, basra, which, was, stopped, by, the, iraqis, meanwhile, an, amphibious, strike, force, landed, at, the, foot, of, the, peninsula, the, resistance, consisting, of, several, thousand, poorly, trained, soldiers, of, the, iraqi, popular, army, fled, or, were, defeated, and, the, iranian, forces, set, up, pontoon, bridges, crossing, the, shatt, al, arab, allowing, 30, 000, soldiers, to, cross, in, a, short, period, of, time, they, drove, north, along, the, peninsula, almost, unopposed, capturing, it, after, only, 24, hours, of, fighting, 240, afterwards, they, dug, in, and, set, up, defenses, the, sudden, capture, of, al, faw, shocked, the, iraqis, since, they, had, thought, it, impossible, for, the, iranians, to, cross, the, shatt, al, arab, on, 12, february, 1986, the, iraqis, began, a, counter, offensive, to, retake, al, faw, which, failed, after, a, week, of, heavy, fighting, on, 24, february, 1986, saddam, sent, one, of, his, best, commanders, general, maher, abd, al, rashid, and, the, republican, guard, to, begin, a, new, offensive, to, recapture, al, faw, a, new, round, of, heavy, fighting, took, place, their, attempts, again, ended, in, failure, costing, them, many, tanks, and, aircraft, their, 15th, mechanised, division, was, almost, completely, wiped, out, the, capture, of, al, faw, and, the, failure, of, the, iraqi, counter, offensives, were, blows, to, the, ba, ath, regime, s, prestige, and, led, the, gulf, countries, to, fear, that, iran, might, win, the, war, kuwait, in, particular, felt, menaced, with, iranian, troops, only, 16, km, 9, 9, mi, away, and, increased, its, support, of, iraq, accordingly, 241, in, march, 1986, the, iranians, tried, to, follow, up, their, success, by, attempting, to, take, umm, qasr, which, would, have, completely, severed, iraq, from, the, gulf, and, placed, iranian, troops, on, the, border, with, kuwait, the, offensive, failed, due, to, iranian, shortages, of, armor, by, this, time, 17, 000, iraqis, and, 30, 000, iranians, were, casualties, the, first, battle, of, al, faw, ended, in, march, but, heavy, combat, operations, lasted, on, the, peninsula, into, 1988, with, neither, side, being, able, to, displace, the, other, the, battle, bogged, down, into, a, world, war, i, style, stalemate, in, the, marshes, of, the, peninsula, immediately, after, the, iranian, capture, of, al, faw, saddam, declared, a, new, offensive, against, iran, designed, to, drive, deep, into, the, state, the, iranian, border, city, of, mehran, on, the, foot, of, the, zagros, mountains, was, selected, as, the, first, target, on, 15, 19, may, iraqi, army, s, second, corps, supported, by, helicopter, gunships, attacked, and, captured, the, city, saddam, then, offered, to, exchange, mehran, for, al, faw, the, iranians, rejected, the, offer, iraq, then, continued, the, attack, attempting, to, push, deeper, into, iran, iraq, s, attack, was, quickly, warded, off, by, iranian, ah, 1, cobra, helicopters, with, tow, missiles, which, destroyed, numerous, iraqi, tanks, and, vehicles, the, iranians, built, up, their, forces, on, the, heights, surrounding, mehran, on, 30, june, using, mountain, warfare, tactics, they, launched, their, attack, recapturing, the, city, by, 3, july, saddam, ordered, the, republican, guard, to, retake, the, city, on, 4, july, but, their, attack, was, ineffective, iraqi, losses, were, heavy, enough, to, allow, the, iranians, to, also, capture, territory, inside, iraq, and, depleted, the, iraqi, military, enough, to, prevent, them, from, launching, a, major, offensive, for, the, next, two, years, iraq, s, defeats, at, al, faw, and, at, mehran, were, severe, blows, to, the, prestige, of, the, iraqi, regime, western, powers, including, the, us, became, more, determined, to, prevent, an, iraqi, loss, through, the, eyes, of, international, observers, iran, was, prevailing, in, the, war, by, the, end, of, 1986, in, the, northern, front, the, iranians, began, launching, attacks, toward, the, city, of, suleimaniya, with, the, help, of, kurdish, fighters, taking, the, iraqis, by, surprise, they, came, within, 16, km, 9, 9, mi, of, the, city, before, being, stopped, by, chemical, and, army, attacks, iran, s, army, had, also, reached, the, meimak, hills, only, 113, km, 70, mi, from, baghdad, iraq, managed, to, contain, iran, s, offensives, in, the, south, but, was, under, serious, pressure, as, the, iranians, were, slowly, overwhelming, them, iraq, retaliated, by, initiating, another, war, of, the, cities, in, one, attack, tehran, s, main, oil, refinery, was, hit, and, in, another, instance, iraq, damaged, iran, s, assadabad, satellite, dish, disrupting, iranian, overseas, telephone, and, telex, service, for, almost, two, weeks, civilian, areas, were, also, hit, resulting, in, many, casualties, iraq, continued, to, attack, oil, tankers, via, air, iran, responded, by, launching, scud, missiles, and, air, attacks, at, iraqi, targets, iraq, continued, to, attack, kharg, island, and, the, oil, tankers, and, facilities, as, well, iran, created, a, tanker, shuttle, service, of, 20, tankers, to, move, oil, from, kharg, to, larak, island, escorted, by, iranian, fighter, jets, once, moved, to, larak, the, oil, would, be, moved, to, oceangoing, tankers, usually, neutral, they, also, rebuilt, the, oil, terminals, damaged, by, iraqi, air, raids, and, moved, shipping, to, larak, island, while, attacking, foreign, tankers, that, carried, iraqi, oil, as, iran, had, blocked, iraq, s, access, to, the, open, sea, with, the, capture, of, al, faw, by, now, they, almost, always, used, the, armed, speedboats, of, the, irgc, navy, and, attacked, many, tankers, the, tanker, war, escalated, drastically, with, attacks, nearly, doubling, in, 1986, the, majority, carried, out, by, iraq, iraq, got, permission, from, the, saudi, government, to, use, its, airspace, to, attack, larak, island, although, due, to, the, distance, attacks, were, less, frequent, there, the, escalating, tanker, war, in, the, gulf, became, an, ever, increasing, concern, to, foreign, powers, especially, the, united, states, in, april, 1986, ayatollah, khomeini, issued, a, fatwa, declaring, that, the, war, must, be, won, by, march, 1987, the, iranians, increased, recruitment, efforts, obtaining, 650, 000, volunteers, the, animosity, between, the, army, and, the, revolutionary, guard, arose, again, with, the, army, wanting, to, use, more, refined, limited, military, attacks, while, the, revolutionary, guard, wanted, to, carry, out, major, offensives, iran, confident, in, its, successes, began, planning, their, largest, offensives, of, the, war, which, they, called, their, final, offensives, faced, with, their, recent, defeats, in, al, faw, and, mehran, iraq, appeared, to, be, losing, the, war, iraq, s, generals, angered, by, saddam, s, interference, threatened, a, full, scale, mutiny, against, the, ba, ath, party, unless, they, were, allowed, to, conduct, operations, freely, in, one, of, the, few, times, during, his, career, saddam, gave, in, to, the, demands, of, his, generals, up, to, this, point, iraqi, strategy, was, to, ride, out, iranian, attacks, however, the, defeat, at, al, faw, led, saddam, to, declare, the, war, to, be, al, defa, al, mutaharakha, the, dynamic, defense, and, announcing, that, all, civilians, had, to, take, part, in, the, war, effort, the, government, tried, to, integrate, the, shias, into, the, war, effort, by, recruiting, many, as, part, of, the, ba, ath, party, in, an, attempt, to, counterbalance, the, religious, fervor, of, the, iranians, and, gain, support, from, the, devout, masses, the, regime, also, began, to, promote, religion, and, on, the, surface, islamization, despite, the, fact, that, iraq, was, run, by, a, secular, regime, scenes, of, saddam, praying, and, making, pilgrimages, to, shrines, became, common, on, state, run, television, while, iraqi, morale, had, been, low, throughout, the, war, the, attack, on, al, faw, raised, patriotic, fervor, as, the, iraqis, feared, invasion, saddam, also, recruited, volunteers, from, other, arab, countries, into, the, republican, guard, and, received, much, technical, support, from, foreign, nations, as, well, while, iraqi, military, power, had, been, depleted, in, recent, battles, through, heavy, foreign, purchases, and, support, they, were, able, to, expand, their, military, to, much, larger, proportions, by, 1988, at, the, same, time, saddam, ordered, the, al, anfal, campaign, in, an, attempt, to, crush, the, kurdish, resistance, who, were, now, allied, with, iran, the, result, was, the, deaths, of, several, hundred, thousand, iraqi, kurds, and, the, destruction, of, villages, towns, and, cities, iraq, began, to, try, to, perfect, its, maneuver, tactics, the, iraqis, began, to, prioritize, the, professionalization, of, their, military, prior, to, 1986, the, conscription, based, iraqi, regular, army, and, the, volunteer, based, iraqi, popular, army, conducted, the, bulk, of, the, operations, in, the, war, to, little, effect, the, republican, guard, formerly, an, elite, praetorian, guard, was, expanded, as, a, volunteer, army, and, filled, with, iraq, s, best, generals, loyalty, to, the, state, was, no, longer, a, primary, requisite, for, joining, after, the, war, due, to, saddam, s, paranoia, the, former, duties, of, the, republican, guard, were, transferred, to, a, new, unit, the, special, republican, guard, full, scale, war, games, against, hypothetical, iranian, positions, were, carried, out, in, the, western, iraqi, desert, against, mock, targets, they, were, repeated, over, the, course, of, a, full, year, until, the, forces, involved, fully, memorized, their, attacks, iraq, built, its, military, massively, eventually, possessing, the, 4th, largest, in, the, world, in, order, to, overwhelm, the, iranians, through, sheer, size, meanwhile, iran, continued, to, attack, as, the, iraqis, were, planning, their, strike, in, 1987, the, iranians, renewed, a, series, of, major, human, wave, offensives, in, both, northern, and, southern, iraq, the, iraqis, had, elaborately, fortified, basra, with, 5, defensive, rings, exploiting, natural, waterways, such, as, the, shatt, al, arab, and, artificial, ones, such, as, fish, lake, and, the, jasim, river, along, with, earth, barriers, fish, lake, was, a, massive, lake, filled, with, mines, underwater, barbed, wire, electrodes, and, sensors, behind, each, waterway, and, defensive, line, was, radar, guided, artillery, ground, attack, aircraft, and, helicopters, all, capable, of, firing, poison, gas, or, conventional, munitions, the, iranian, strategy, was, to, penetrate, the, iraqi, defences, and, encircle, basra, cutting, off, the, city, as, well, as, the, al, faw, peninsula, from, the, rest, of, iraq, iran, s, plan, was, for, three, assaults, a, diversionary, attack, near, basra, the, main, offensive, and, another, diversionary, attack, using, iranian, tanks, in, the, north, to, divert, iraqi, heavy, armor, from, basra, for, these, battles, iran, had, re, expanded, their, military, by, recruiting, many, new, basij, and, pasdaran, volunteers, iran, brought, 150, 000, 200, 000, total, troops, into, the, battles, on, 25, december, 1986, iran, launched, operation, karbala, 4, karbala, referring, to,

island, of, umm, al, rassas, in, the, shatt, al, arab, river, parallel, to, khoramshahr, they, then, set, up, a, pontoon, bridge, and, continued, the, attack, eventually, capturing, the, island, in, a, costly, success, but, failing, to, advance, further, the, iranians, had, 60, 000, casualties, while, the, iraqis, 9, 500, the, iraqi, commanders, exaggerated, iranian, losses, to, saddam, and, it, was, assumed, that, the, main, iranian, attack, on, basra, had, been, fully, defeated, and, that, it, would, take, the, iranians, six, months, to, recover, when, the, main, iranian, attack, operation, karbala, 5, began, many, iraqi, troops, were, on, leave, the, siege, of, basra, code, named, operation, karbala, 5, persian, was, an, offensive, operation, carried, out, by, iran, in, an, effort, to, capture, the, iraqi, port, city, of, basra, in, early, 1987, this, battle, known, for, its, extensive, casualties, and, ferocious, conditions, was, the, biggest, battle, of, the, war, and, proved, to, be, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, the, iran, iraq, war, while, iranian, forces, crossed, the, border, and, captured, the, eastern, section, of, basra, governorate, the, operation, ended, in, a, stalemate, at, the, same, time, as, operation, karbala, 5, iran, launched, operation, karbala, 6, against, the, iraqis, in, qasr, e, shirin, in, central, iran, to, prevent, the, iraqis, from, rapidly, transferring, units, down, to, defend, against, the, karbala, 5, attack, the, attack, was, carried, out, by, basij, infantry, and, the, revolutionary, guard, s, 31st, ashura, and, the, army, s, 77th, khorasan, armored, divisions, the, basij, attacked, the, iraqi, lines, forcing, the, iraqi, infantry, to, retreat, an, iraqi, armored, counter, attack, surrounded, the, basij, in, a, pincer, movement, the, iranian, tank, divisions, attacked, breaking, the, encirclement, the, iranian, attack, was, stopped, by, mass, iraqi, chemical, weapons, attacks, operation, karbala, 5, was, a, severe, blow, to, iran, s, military, and, morale, to, foreign, observers, it, appeared, that, iran, was, continuing, to, strengthen, by, 1988, iran, had, become, self, sufficient, in, many, areas, such, as, anti, tank, tow, missiles, scud, ballistic, missiles, shahab, 1, silkworm, anti, ship, missiles, oghab, tactical, rockets, and, producing, spare, parts, for, their, weaponry, iran, had, improved, its, air, defenses, with, smuggled, surface, to, air, missiles, iran, was, even, producing, uav, s, and, the, pilatus, pc, 7, propeller, aircraft, for, observation, iran, doubled, their, stocks, of, artillery, and, was, self, sufficient, in, the, manufacture, of, ammunition, and, small, arms, while, it, was, not, obvious, to, foreign, observers, the, iranian, public, had, become, increasingly, war, weary, and, disillusioned, with, the, fighting, and, relatively, few, volunteers, joined, the, fight, in, 1987, 88, because, the, iranian, war, effort, relied, on, popular, mobilization, their, military, strength, actually, declined, and, iran, was, unable, to, launch, any, major, offensives, after, karbala, 5, as, a, result, for, the, first, time, since, 1982, the, momentum, of, the, fighting, shifted, towards, the, regular, army, since, the, regular, army, was, conscription, based, it, made, the, war, even, less, popular, many, iranians, began, to, try, to, escape, the, conflict, as, early, as, may, 1985, anti, war, demonstrations, took, place, in, 74, cities, throughout, iran, which, were, crushed, by, the, regime, resulting, in, some, protesters, being, shot, and, killed, the, leadership, acknowledged, that, the, war, was, a, stalemate, and, began, to, plan, accordingly, no, more, final, offensives, were, planned, the, head, of, the, supreme, defense, council, akbar, rafsanjani, announced, during, a, news, conference, the, end, of, human, wave, attacks, mohsen, rezaee, head, of, the, irgc, announced, that, iran, would, focus, exclusively, on, limited, attacks, and, infiltrations, while, arming, and, supporting, opposition, groups, inside, of, iraq, on, the, iranian, home, front, sanctions, declining, oil, prices, and, iraqi, attacks, on, iranian, oil, facilities, and, shipping, took, a, heavy, toll, on, the, economy, while, the, attacks, themselves, were, not, as, destructive, as, some, analysts, believed, the, u, s, led, operation, earnest, will, which, protected, iraqi, and, allied, oil, tankers, but, not, iranian, ones, led, many, neutral, countries, to, stop, trading, with, iran, because, of, rising, insurance, and, fear, of, air, attack, iranian, oil, and, non, oil, exports, fell, by, 55, inflation, reached, 50, by, 1987, and, unemployment, skyrocketed, at, the, same, time, iraq, was, experiencing, crushing, debt, and, shortages, of, workers, encouraging, its, leadership, to, try, to, end, the, war, quickly, by, the, end, of, 1987, iraq, possessed, 5, 550, tanks, outnumbering, the, iranians, six, to, one, and, 900, fighter, aircraft, outnumbering, the, iranians, ten, to, one, after, operation, karbala, 5, iraq, only, had, 100, qualified, fighter, pilots, remaining, therefore, iraq, began, to, invest, in, recruiting, foreign, pilots, from, countries, such, as, belgium, south, africa, pakistan, east, germany, and, the, soviet, union, they, replenished, their, manpower, by, integrating, volunteers, from, other, arab, countries, into, their, army, iraq, also, became, self, sufficient, in, chemical, weapons, and, some, conventional, ones, and, received, much, equipment, from, abroad, foreign, support, helped, iraq, bypass, its, economic, troubles, and, massive, debt, to, continue, the, war, and, increase, the, size, of, its, military, while, the, southern, and, central, fronts, were, at, a, stalemate, iran, began, to, focus, on, carrying, out, offensives, in, northern, iraq, with, the, help, of, the, peshmerga, kurdish, insurgents, the, iranians, used, a, combination, of, semi, guerrilla, and, infiltration, tactics, in, the, kurdish, mountains, with, the, peshmerga, during, operation, karbala, 9, in, early, april, iran, captured, territory, near, suleimaniya, provoking, a, severe, poison, gas, counter, attack, during, operation, karbala, 10, iran, attacked, near, the, same, area, capturing, more, territory, during, operation, nasr, 4, the, iranians, surrounded, the, city, of, suleimaniya, and, with, the, help, of, the, peshmerga, infiltrated, over, 140, km, into, iraq, and, raided, and, threatened, to, capture, the, oil, rich, city, of, kirkuk, and, other, northern, oilfields, with, the, stalemate, on, land, the, air, tanker, war, began, to, play, an, increasingly, major, role, in, the, conflict, the, iranian, air, force, had, become, very, small, with, only, 20, f, 4, phantoms, 20, f, 5, tigers, and, 15, f, 14, tomcats, in, operation, although, iran, managed, to, restore, some, damaged, planes, to, service, the, iranian, air, force, despite, its, once, sophisticated, equipment, lacked, enough, equipment, and, personnel, to, sustain, the, war, of, attrition, that, had, developed, and, was, unable, to, lead, an, outright, onslaught, against, iraq, the, iraqi, air, force, had, originally, lacked, modern, equipment, and, experienced, pilots, but, after, pleas, from, iraqi, military, leaders, saddam, decreased, political, influence, on, everyday, operations, and, left, the, fighting, to, his, combatants, the, soviets, began, delivering, more, advanced, aircraft, and, weapons, to, iraq, while, the, french, improved, training, for, flight, crews, and, technical, personnel, and, continually, introduced, new, methods, for, countering, iranian, weapons, and, tactics, iranian, ground, air, defense, still, shot, down, many, iraqi, aircraft, the, main, iraqi, air, effort, had, shifted, to, the, destruction, of, iranian, war, fighting, capability, primarily, persian, gulf, oil, fields, tankers, and, kharg, island, and, starting, in, late, 1986, the, iraqi, air, force, began, a, comprehensive, campaign, against, iranian, economic, infrastructure, by, late, 1987, the, iraqi, air, force, could, count, on, direct, american, support, for, conducting, long, range, operations, against, iranian, infrastructural, targets, and, oil, installations, deep, in, the, persian, gulf, u, s, navy, ships, tracked, and, reported, movements, of, iranian, shipping, and, defences, in, the, massive, iraqi, air, strike, against, kharg, island, flown, on, 18, march, 1988, the, iraqis, destroyed, two, supertankers, but, lost, five, aircraft, to, iranian, f, 14, tomcats, including, two, tupolev, tu, 22, bs, and, one, mikoyan, mig, 25, rb, the, attacks, on, oil, tankers, continued, both, iran, and, iraq, carried, out, frequent, attacks, during, the, first, four, months, of, the, year, iran, was, effectively, waging, a, naval, guerilla, war, with, its, irgc, navy, speedboats, while, iraq, attacked, with, its, aircraft, in, 1987, kuwait, asked, to, reflag, its, tankers, to, the, u, s, flag, they, did, so, in, march, and, the, u, s, navy, began, operation, earnest, will, to, escort, the, tankers, the, result, of, earnest, will, would, be, that, while, oil, tankers, shipping, iraqi, kuwaiti, oil, were, protected, iranian, tankers, and, neutral, tankers, shipping, to, iran, would, be, unprotected, resulting, in, both, losses, for, iran, and, the, undermining, of, its, trade, with, foreign, countries, damaging, iran, s, economy, further, iran, deployed, silkworm, missiles, to, attack, ships, but, only, a, few, were, actually, fired, both, the, united, states, and, iran, jockeyed, for, influence, in, the, gulf, to, discourage, the, united, states, from, escorting, tankers, iran, secretly, mined, some, areas, the, united, states, began, to, escort, the, reflagged, tankers, but, one, was, damaged, by, a, mine, while, under, escort, while, being, a, public, relations, victory, for, iran, the, united, states, increased, its, reflagging, efforts, while, iran, mined, the, persian, gulf, their, speedboat, attacks, were, reduced, primarily, attacking, unflagged, tankers, shipping, in, the, area, on, 24, september, us, navy, seals, captured, the, iranian, mine, laying, ship, iran, ajr, a, diplomatic, disaster, for, the, already, isolated, iranians, iran, had, previously, sought, to, maintain, at, least, a, pretense, of, plausible, deniability, regarding, its, use, of, mines, but, the, navy, seals, captured, and, photographed, extensive, evidence, of, iran, ajr, s, mine, laying, activities, on, 8, october, the, u,

oil, rigs, in, the, persian, gulf, during, november, and, december, the, iraqi, air, force, launched, a, bid, to, destroy, all, iranian, airbases, in, khuzestan, and, the, remaining, iranian, air, force, iran, managed, to, shoot, down, 30, iraqi, fighters, with, fighter, jets, anti, aircraft, guns, and, missiles, allowing, the, iranian, air, force, to, survive, to, the, end, of, the, war, on, 28, june, iraqi, fighter, bombers, attacked, the, iranian, town, of, sardasht, near, the, border, using, chemical, mustard, gas, bombs, while, many, towns, and, cities, had, been, bombed, before, and, troops, attacked, with, gas, this, was, the, first, time, that, the, iraqis, had, attacked, a, civilian, area, with, poison, gas, one, quarter, of, the, town, s, then, population, of, 20, 000, was, burned, and, stricken, and, 113, were, killed, immediately, with, many, more, dying, and, suffering, health, effects, over, following, decades, by, 1988, with, massive, equipment, imports, and, reduced, iranian, volunteers, iraq, was, ready, to, launch, major, offensives, against, iran, in, february, 1988, saddam, began, the, fifth, and, most, deadly, war, of, the, cities, over, the, next, two, months, iraq, launched, over, 200, al, husayn, missiles, at, 37, iranian, cities, saddam, also, threatened, to, use, chemical, weapons, in, his, missiles, which, caused, 30, of, tehran, s, population, to, leave, the, city, iran, retaliated, launching, at, least, 104, missiles, against, iraq, in, 1988, and, shelling, basra, this, event, was, nicknamed, the, scud, duel, in, the, foreign, media, in, all, iraq, launched, 520, scuds, and, al, husseins, against, iran, and, iran, fired, 177, in, return, the, iranian, attacks, were, too, few, in, number, to, deter, iraq, from, launching, their, attacks, iraq, also, increased, their, airstrikes, against, kharg, island, and, iranian, oil, tankers, with, their, tankers, protected, by, u, s, warships, they, could, operate, with, virtual, impunity, in, addition, the, west, supplied, iraq, s, air, force, with, laser, guided, smart, bombs, allowing, them, to, attack, economic, targets, while, evading, anti, aircraft, defenses, these, attacks, began, to, have, a, major, toll, on, the, iranian, economy, and, morale, and, caused, many, casualties, in, march, 1988, the, iranians, carried, out, operation, dawn, 10, operation, beit, ol, moqaddas, 2, and, operation, zafar, 7, in, iraqi, kurdistan, with, the, aim, of, capturing, the, darbandikhan, dam, and, the, power, plant, at, lake, dukan, which, supplied, iraq, with, much, of, its, electricity, and, water, as, well, as, the, city, of, suleimaniya, 264, iran, hoped, that, the, capture, of, these, areas, would, bring, more, favourable, terms, to, the, ceasefire, agreement, this, infiltration, offensive, was, carried, out, in, conjunction, with, the, peshmerga, iranian, airborne, commandos, landed, behind, the, iraqi, lines, and, iranian, helicopters, hit, iraqi, tanks, with, tow, missiles, the, iraqis, were, taken, by, surprise, and, iranian, f, 5e, tiger, fighter, jets, even, damaged, the, kirkuk, oil, refinery, iraq, carried, out, executions, of, multiple, officers, for, these, failures, in, march, april, 1988, including, colonel, jafar, sadeq, the, iranians, used, infiltration, tactics, in, the, kurdish, mountains, captured, the, town, of, halabja, and, began, to, fan, out, across, the, province, though, the, iranians, advanced, to, within, sight, of, dukan, and, captured, around, 1, 040, km, 2, 400, sq, mi, and, 4, 000, iraqi, troops, the, offensive, failed, due, to, the, iraqi, use, of, chemical, warfare, 264, the, iraqis, launched, the, deadliest, chemical, weapons, attacks, of, the, war, the, republican, guard, launched, 700, chemical, shells, while, the, other, artillery, divisions, launched, 200, 300, chemical, shells, each, unleashing, a, chemical, cloud, over, the, iranians, killing, or, wounding, 60, of, them, the, blow, was, felt, particularly, by, the, iranian, 84th, infantry, division, and, 55th, paratrooper, division, the, iraqi, special, forces, then, stopped, the, remains, of, the, iranian, force, in, retaliation, for, kurdish, collaboration, with, the, iranians, iraq, launched, a, massive, poison, gas, attack, against, kurdish, civilians, in, halabja, recently, taken, by, the, iranians, killing, thousands, of, civilians, iran, airlifted, foreign, journalists, to, the, ruined, city, and, the, images, of, the, dead, were, shown, throughout, the, world, but, western, mistrust, of, iran, and, collaboration, with, iraq, led, them, to, also, blame, iran, for, the, attack, on, 17, april, 1988, iraq, launched, operation, ramadan, mubarak, blessed, ramadan, a, surprise, attack, against, the, 15, 000, basij, troops, on, the, al, faw, peninsula, the, attack, was, preceded, by, iraqi, diversionary, attacks, in, northern, iraq, with, a, massive, artillery, and, air, barrage, of, iranian, front, lines, key, areas, such, as, supply, lines, command, posts, and, ammunition, depots, were, hit, by, a, storm, of, mustard, gas, and, nerve, gas, as, well, as, by, conventional, explosives, helicopters, landed, iraqi, commandos, behind, iranian, lines, on, al, faw, while, the, main, iraqi, force, made, a, frontal, assault, within, 48, hours, all, of, the, iranian, forces, had, been, killed, or, cleared, from, the, al, faw, peninsula, the, day, was, celebrated, in, iraq, as, faw, liberation, day, throughout, saddam, s, rule, the, iraqis, had, planned, the, offensive, well, prior, to, the, attack, the, iraqi, soldiers, gave, themselves, poison, gas, antidotes, to, shield, themselves, from, the, effect, of, the, saturation, of, gas, the, heavy, and, well, executed, use, of, chemical, weapons, was, the, decisive, factor, in, the, victory, iraqi, losses, were, relatively, light, especially, compared, to, iran, s, casualties, ra, ad, al, hamdani, later, recounted, that, the, recapture, of, al, faw, marked, the, highest, point, of, experience, and, expertise, that, the, iraqi, army, reached, the, iranians, eventually, managed, to, halt, the, iraqi, drive, as, they, pushed, towards, khuzestan, to, the, shock, of, the, iranians, rather, than, breaking, off, the, offensive, the, iraqis, kept, up, their, drive, and, a, new, force, attacked, the, iranian, positions, around, basra, following, this, the, iraqis, launched, a, sustained, drive, to, clear, the, iranians, out, of, all, of, southern, iraq, 264, one, of, the, most, successful, iraqi, tactics, was, the, one, two, punch, attack, using, chemical, weapons, using, artillery, they, would, saturate, the, iranian, front, line, with, rapidly, dispersing, cyanide, and, nerve, gas, while, longer, lasting, mustard, gas, was, launched, via, fighter, bombers, and, rockets, against, the, iranian, rear, creating, a, chemical, wall, that, blocked, reinforcement, the, same, day, as, iraq, s, attack, on, al, faw, peninsula, the, united, states, navy, launched, operation, praying, mantis, in, retaliation, against, iran, for, damaging, a, warship, with, a, mine, iran, lost, oil, platforms, destroyers, and, frigates, in, this, battle, which, ended, only, when, president, reagan, decided, that, the, iranian, navy, had, been, damaged, enough, in, spite, of, this, the, revolutionary, guard, navy, continued, their, speedboat, attacks, against, oil, tankers, the, defeats, at, al, faw, and, in, the, persian, gulf, nudged, iranian, leadership, towards, quitting, the, war, especially, when, facing, the, prospect, of, fighting, the, americans, faced, with, such, losses, khomeini, appointed, rafsanjani, as, the, supreme, commander, of, the, armed, forces, though, he, had, in, actuality, occupied, that, position, for, months, rafsanjani, ordered, a, last, desperate, counter, attack, into, iraq, which, was, launched, 13, june, 1988, the, iranians, infiltrated, through, the, iraqi, trenches, and, moved, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, into, iraq, and, managed, to, strike, saddam, s, presidential, palace, in, baghdad, using, fighter, aircraft, after, three, days, of, fighting, the, decimated, iranians, were, driven, back, to, their, original, positions, again, as, the, iraqis, launched, 650, helicopter, and, 300, aircraft, sorties, on, 18, june, 1988, the, people, s, mujahedin, of, iran, mek, conducted, a, military, operation, known, as, operation, forty, stars, persian, in, four, days, the, people, s, mujahedin, of, iran, wiped, out, a, pasdaran, division, seizing, mehran, and, building, a, bridgehead, twelve, miles, into, iran, according, to, the, mek, iraqi, soldiers, did, not, participate, in, the, operation, baghdad, also, said, it, was, not, involved, in, the, battle, on, 25, may, 1988, iraq, launched, the, first, of, five, tawakalna, ala, allah, operations, consisting, of, one, of, the, largest, artillery, barrages, in, history, coupled, with, chemical, weapons, the, marshes, had, been, dried, by, drought, allowing, the, iraqis, to, use, tanks, to, bypass, iranian, field, fortifications, expelling, the, iranians, from, the, border, town, of, shalamcheh, after, less, than, 10, hours, of, combat, 11, 265, on, 25, june, iraq, launched, the, second, tawakal, ala, allah, operation, against, the, iranians, on, majnoon, island, iraqi, commandos, used, amphibious, craft, to, block, the, iranian, rear, then, used, hundreds, of, tanks, with, massed, conventional, and, chemical, artillery, barrages, to, recapture, the, island, after, 8, hours, of, combat, saddam, appeared, live, on, iraqi, television, to, lead, the, charge, against, the, iranians, the, majority, of, the, iranian, defenders, were, killed, during, the, quick, assault, the, final, two, tawakal, ala, allah, operations, took, place, near, al, amarah, and, khaneqan, by, 12, july, the, iraqis, had, captured, the, city, of, dehloran, 30, km, 19, mi, inside, iran, along, with, 2, 500, troops, and, much, armour, and, material, which, took, four, days, to, transport, to, iraq, these, losses, included, more, than, 570, of, the, 1, 000, remaining, iranian, tanks, over, 430, armored, vehicles, 45, self, propelled, artillery, 300, towed, artillery, pieces, and, 320, antiaircraft, guns, these, figures, only, included, what, iraq, could, actually, put, to, use, total, amount, of, captured, materiel, was, higher, since, march, the, iraqis, claimed, to, have, captured, 1, 298, tanks, 155, infantry, fighting, vehicles, 512, heavy, artillery, pieces, 6, 196, mortars, 5, 550, recoilless, rifles, and, light, guns, 8, 050, man,

conquer, iranian, territory, history, professor, kaveh, farrokh, considered, this, to, be, iran, s, greatest, military, disaster, during, the, war, stephen, pelletier, a, journalist, middle, east, expert, and, author, noted, that, tawakal, ala, allah, resulted, in, the, absolute, destruction, of, iran, s, military, machine, during, the, 1988, battles, the, iranians, put, up, little, resistance, having, been, worn, out, by, nearly, eight, years, of, war, 253, they, lost, large, amounts, of, equipment, on, 2, july, iran, belatedly, set, up, a, joint, central, command, which, unified, the, revolutionary, guard, army, and, kurdish, rebels, and, dispelled, the, rivalry, between, the, army, and, the, revolutionary, guard, however, this, came, too, late, and, following, the, capture, of, 570, of, their, operable, tanks, and, the, destruction, of, hundreds, more, iran, was, believed, to, have, fewer, than, 200, remaining, operable, tanks, on, the, southern, front, against, thousands, of, iraqi, ones, the, only, area, where, the, iranians, were, not, suffering, major, defeats, was, in, kurdistan, saddam, sent, a, warning, to, khomeini, in, mid, 1988, threatening, to, launch, a, new, and, powerful, full, scale, invasion, and, attack, iranian, cities, with, weapons, of, mass, destruction, shortly, afterwards, iraqi, aircraft, bombed, the, iranian, town, of, oshnavieh, with, poison, gas, immediately, killing, and, wounding, over, 2, 000, civilians, the, fear, of, an, all, out, chemical, attack, against, iran, s, largely, unprotected, civilian, population, weighed, heavily, on, the, iranian, leadership, and, they, realized, that, the, international, community, had, no, intention, of, restraining, iraq, the, lives, of, the, civilian, population, of, iran, were, becoming, very, disrupted, with, a, third, of, the, urban, population, evacuating, major, cities, in, fear, of, the, seemingly, imminent, chemical, war, meanwhile, iraqi, conventional, bombs, and,

came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, united, states, was, on, the, verge, of, waging, a, full, scale, war, against, them, and, that, iraq, was, on, the, verge, of, unleashing, its, entire, chemical, arsenal, upon, their, cities, at, this, point, elements, of, the, iranian, leadership, led, by, rafsanjani, who, had, initially, pushed, for, the, extension, of, the, war, persuaded, khomeini, to, accept, a, ceasefire, they, stated, that, in, order, to, win, the, war, iran, s, military, budget, would, have, to, be, increased, eightfold, and, the, war, would, last, until, 1993, on, 20, july, 1988, iran, accepted, resolution, 598, showing, its, willingness, to, accept, a, ceasefire, 11, a, statement, from, khomeini, was, read, out, in, a, radio, address, and, he, expressed, deep,

in, the, streets, in, tehran, however, the, end, of, the, war, was, greeted, with, a, somber, mood, 1, operation, mersad, ambush, was, the, last, big, military, operation, of, the, war, both, iran, and, iraq, had, accepted, resolution, 598, but, despite, the, ceasefire, after, seeing, iraqi, victories, in, the, previous, months, mujahadeen, e, khalq, mek, decided, to, launch, an, attack, of, its, own, and, wished, to, advance, all, the, way, to, tehran, saddam, and, the, iraqi, high, command, decided, on, a, two, pronged, offensive, across, the, border, into, central, iran, and, iranian, kurdistan, shortly, after, iran, accepted, the, ceasefire, the, mek, army, began, its, offensive, attacking, into, ilam, province, under, cover, of, iraqi, air, power, in, the, north, iraq, also, launched, an, attack, into, iraqi, kurdistan, which, was, blunted, by, the, iranians, on, 26, july, 1988, the, mek, started, their, campaign, in, central, iran, operation, forough, javidan, eternal,

combat, actions, of, the, war, took, place, on, 3, august, 1988, in, the, persian, gulf, when, the, iranian, navy, fired, on, a, freighter, and, iraq, launched, chemical, attacks, on, iranian,

field, remaining, on, the, iran, iraq, border, until, 1991, the, majority, of, western, analysts, believe, that, the, war, had, no, winners, while, some, believed, that, iraq, emerged, as, the, victor, of, the, war, based, on, iraq, s, overwhelming, successes, between, april, and, july, 1988, while, the, war, was, now, over, iraq, spent, the, rest, of, august, and, early, september,

armed, forces, of, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, to, evacuate, iraqi, territory, to, honor, pre, war, international, borders, set, by, the, 1975, algiers, agreement, the, last, prisoners, of, war, were, exchanged, in, 2003, the, security, council, did, not, identify, iraq, as, the, aggressor, of, the, war, until, 11, december, 1991, some, 11, years, after, iraq, invaded, iran, and, 16, months, following, iraq, s, invasion, of, kuwait, the, iran, iraq, war, was, the, deadliest, conventional, war, ever, fought, between, regular, armies, of, developing, countries, encyclop, dia, britannica, states, estimates, of, total, casualties, range, from, 1, 000, 000, to, twice, that, number, the, number, killed, on, both, sides, was, perhaps, 500, 000, with, iran, suffering, the, greatest, losses, iraqi, casualties, are, estimated, at, 105, 000, 200, 000, killed, while, about, 400, 000, had, been, wounded, and, some, 70, 000, taken, prisoner, thousands, of, civilians, on, both, sides, died, in, air, raids, and, ballistic, missile, attacks, prisoners, taken, by, both, countries, began, to, be, released, in, 1990, though, some, were, not, released, until, more, than, 10, years, after, the, end, of, the, conflict, cities, on, both, sides, had, also, been, considerably, damaged, while, revolutionary, iran, had, been, bloodied, iraq, was, left, with, a, large, military, and, was, a, regional, power, albeit, with, severe, debt, financial, problems, and, labour, shortages, according, to, iranian, government, sources, the, war, cost, iran, an, estimated, 200, 000, 220, 000, killed, or, up, to, 262, 000, according, to, the, conservative, western, estimates, this, includes, 123, 220, combatants, 60, 711, mia, and, 11, 000, 16, 000, civilians, combatants, include, 79, 664, members, of, the, revolutionary, guard, corps, and, additional, 35, 170, soldiers, from, regular, military, in, addition, prisoners, of, war, accounted, for, 42, 875, iranian, casualties, captured, and, kept, in, iraqi, detention, centres, from, 2, 5, to, more, than, 15, years, after, the, war, was, over, according, to, the, janbazan, affairs, organization, 398, 587, iranians, sustained, injuries, that, required, prolonged, medical, and, health, care, following, primary, treatment, including, 52, 195, 13, injured, due, to, the, exposure, to, chemical, warfare, agents, from, 1980, to, 2012, 218, 867,

children, were, orphaned, as, a, consequence, of, these, deaths, other, estimates, put, iranian, casualties, up, to, 600, 000, both, iraq, and, iran, manipulated, loss, figures, to, suit, their, purposes, at, the, same, time, western, analysts, accepted, improbable, estimates, by, april, 1988, such, casualties, were, estimated, at, between, 150, 000, and, 340, 000, iraqis, dead, and, 450, 000, to, 730, 000, iranians, shortly, after, the, end, of, the, war, it, was, thought, that, iran, suffered, even, more, than, a, million, dead, considering, the, style, of, fighting, on, the, ground, and, the, fact, that, neither, side, penetrated, deeply, into, the, other, s, territory, usmc, analysts, believe, events, do, not, substantiate, the, high, casualties, claimed, the, iraqi, government, has, claimed, 800, 000, iranians, were, killed, in, action, four, times, more, than, iranian, official, figures, whereas, iraqi, intelligence, privately, put, the, number, at, 228, 000, 258, 000, as, of, august, 1986, iraqi, losses, were, also, revised, downwards, over, time, with, the, ceasefire, in, place, and, un, peacekeepers, monitoring, the, border, iran, and, iraq, sent, their, representatives, to, geneva, switzerland, to, negotiate, a, peace, agreement, on, the, terms, of, the, ceasefire, however, peace, talks, stalled, iraq, in, violation, of, the, un, ceasefire, refused, to, withdraw, its, troops, from, 7, 800, square, kilometres, 3, 000, sq, mi, of, disputed, territory, at, the, border, area, unless, the, iranians, accepted, iraq, s, full, sovereignty, over, the, shatt, al, arab, waterway, foreign, powers, continued, to, support, iraq, which, wanted, to, gain, at, the, negotiating, table, what, they, failed, to, achieve, on, the, battlefield, and, iran, was, portrayed, as, the, one, not, wanting, peace, in, response, iran, refused, to, release, 70, 000, iraqi, prisoners, of, war, compared, to, 40, 000, iranian, prisoners, of, war, held, by, iraq, they, continued, to, carry, out, a, naval, blockade, of, iraq, although, its, effects, were, mitigated, by, iraqi, use, of, ports, in, friendly, neighbouring, arab, countries, iran, began, to, improve, relations, with, many, of, the, states, that, opposed, it, during, the, war, because, of, iranian, actions, by, 1990, saddam, had, become, more, conciliatory, and, in, a, letter, to, the, future, fourth, president, of, iran, rafsanjani, he, became, more, open, to, the, idea, of, a, peace, agreement, although, he, still, insisted, on, full, sovereignty, over, the, shatt, al, arab, by, 1990, iran, was, undergoing, military, rearmament, and, reorganization, and, purchased, 10, billion, worth, of, heavy, weaponry, from, the, ussr, and, china, including, aircraft, tanks, and, missiles, rafsanjani, reversed, iran, s, self, imposed, ban, on, chemical, weapons, and, ordered, the, manufacture, and, stockpile, of, them, iran, destroyed, them, in, 1993, after, ratifying, the, chemical, weapons, convention, as, war, with, the, western, powers, loomed, iraq, became, concerned, about, the, possibility, of, iran, mending, its, relations, with, the, west, in, order, to, attack, iraq, iraq, had, lost, its, support, from, the, west, and, its, position, in, iran, was, increasingly, untenable, saddam, realized, that, if, iran, attempted, to, expel, the, iraqis, from, the, disputed, territories, in, the, border, area, it, was, likely, they, would, succeed, shortly, after, his, invasion, of, kuwait, saddam, wrote, a, letter, to, rafsanjani, stating, that, iraq, recognised, iranian, rights, over, the, eastern, half, of, the, shatt, al, arab, a, reversion, to, status, quo, ante, bellum, that, he, had, repudiated, a, decade, earlier, and, that, he, would, accept, iran, s, demands, and, withdraw, iraq, s, military, from, the, disputed, territories, a, peace, agreement, was, signed, finalizing, the, terms, of, the, un, resolution, diplomatic, relations, were, restored, and, by, late, 1990, early, 1991, the, iraqi, military, withdrew, the, un, peacekeepers, withdrew, from, the, border, shortly, afterward, most, of, the, prisoners, of, war, were, released, in, 1990, although, some, remained, as, late, as, 2003, iranian, politicians, declared, it, to, be, the, greatest, victory, in, the, history, of, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, most, historians, and, analysts, consider, the, war, to, be, a, stalemate, certain, analysts, believe, that, iraq, won, on, the, basis, of, the, successes, of, their, 1988, offensives, which, thwarted, iran, s, major, territorial, ambitions, in, iraq, and, persuaded, iran, to, accept, the, ceasefire, iranian, analysts, believe, that, they, won, the, war, because, although, they, did, not, succeed, in, overthrowing, the, iraqi, government, they, thwarted, iraq, s, major, territorial, ambitions, in, iran, and, that, two, years, after, the, war, had, ended, iraq, permanently, gave, up, its, claim, of, ownership, over, the, entire, shatt, al, arab, as, well, on, 9, december, 1991, javier, p, rez, de, cu, llar, un, secretary, general, at, the, time, reported, that, iraq, s, initiation, of, the, war, was, unjustified, as, was, its, occupation, of, iranian, territory, and, use, of, chemical, weapons, against, civilians, that, explanations, do, not, appear, sufficient, or, acceptable, to, the, international, community, is, a, fact, cannot, be, justified, under, the, charter, of, the, united, nations, any, recognized, rules, and, principles, of, international, law, or, any, principles, of, international, morality, and, entails, the, responsibility, for, conflict, even, if, before, the, outbreak, of, the, conflict, there, had, been, some, encroachment, by, iran, on, iraqi, territory, such, encroachment, did, not, justify, iraq, s, aggression, against, iran, which, was, followed, by, iraq, s, continuous, occupation, of, iranian, territory, during, the, conflict, in, violation, of, the, prohibition, of, the, use, of, force, which, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, rules, of, jus, cogens, on, one, occasion, i, had, to, note, with, deep, regret, the, experts, conclusion, that, chemical, weapons, ha, been, used, against, iranian, civilians, in, an, area, adjacent, to, an, urban, center, lacking, any, protection, against, that, kind, of, attack, he, also, stated, that, had, the, un, accepted, this, fact, earlier, the, war, would, have, almost, certainly, not, lasted, as, long, as, it, did, iran, encouraged, by, the, announcement, sought, reparations, from, iraq, but, never, received, any, throughout, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, iran, and, iraq, relations, remained, balanced, between, a, cold, war, and, a, cold, peace, despite, renewed, and, somewhat, thawed, relations, both, sides, continued, to, have, low, level, conflicts, iraq, continued, to, host, and, support, the, mujahedeen, e, khalq, which, carried, out, multiple, attacks, throughout, iran, up, until, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, including, the, assassination, of, iranian, general, ali, sayyad, shirazi, in, 1998, cross, border, raids, and, mortar, attacks, iran, carried, out, several, airstrikes, and, missile, attacks, against, mujahedeen, targets, inside, of, iraq, the, largest, taking, place, in, 2001, when, iran, fired, 56, scud, missiles, at, mujahedeen, targets, according, to, general, hamdani, iran, continued, to, carry, out, low, level, infiltrations, of, iraqi, territory, using, iraqi, dissidents, and, anti, government, activists, rather, than, iranian, troops, in, order, to, incite, revolts, after, the, fall, of, saddam, in, 2003, hamdani, claimed, that, iranian, agents, infiltrated, and, created, numerous, militias, in, iraq, and, built, an, intelligence, system, operating, within, the, country, in, 2005, the, new, government, of, iraq, apologised, to, iran, for, starting, the, war, the, iraqi, government, also, commemorated, the, war, with, various, monuments, including, the, hands, of, victory, and, the, al, shaheed, monument, both, in, baghdad, the, war, also, helped, to, create, a, forerunner, for, the, coalition, of, the, gulf, war, when, the, gulf, arab, states, banded, together, early, in, the, war, to, form, the, gulf, cooperation, council, to, help, iraq, fight, iran, the, economic, loss, at, the, time, was, believed, to, exceed, 500, billion, for, each, country, 1, 2, trillion, total, in, addition, economic, development, stalled, and, oil, exports, were, disrupted, iraq, had, accrued, more, than, 130, billion, of, international, debt, excluding, interest, and, was, also, weighed, down, by, a, slowed, gdp, growth, iraq, s, debt, to, the, paris, club, amounted, to, 21, billion, 85, of, which, had, originated, from, the, combined, inputs, of, japan, the, ussr, france, germany, the, united, states, italy, and, the, united, kingdom, the, largest, portion, of, iraq, s, debt, amounting, to, 130, billion, was, to, its, former, arab, backers, with, 67, billion, loaned, by, kuwait, saudi, arabia, qatar, uae, and, jordan, after, the, war, iraq, accused, kuwait, of, slant, drilling, and, stealing, oil, inciting, its, invasion, of, kuwait, which, in, turn, worsened, iraq, s, financial, situation, the, united, nations, compensation, commission, mandated, iraq, to, pay, reparations, of, more, than, 200, billion, to, victims, of, the, invasion, including, kuwait, and, the, united, states, to, enforce, payment, iraq, was, put, under, a, comprehensive, international, embargo, which, further, strained, the, iraqi, economy, and, pushed, its, external, debt, to, private, and, public, sectors, to, more, than, 500, billion, by, the, end, of, saddam, s, rule, combined, with, iraq, s, negative, economic, growth, after, prolonged, international, sanctions, this, produced, a, debt, to, gdp, ratio, of, more, than, 1, 000, making, iraq, the, most, indebted, developing, country, in, the, world, the, unsustainable, economic, situation, compelled, the, new, iraqi, government, to, request, that, a, considerable, portion, of, debt, incurred, during, the, iran, iraq, war, be, written, off, the, war, had, its, impact, on, medical, science, a, surgical, intervention, for, comatose, patients, with, penetrating, brain, injuries, was, created, by, iranian, physicians, treating, wounded, soldiers, later, establishing, neurosurgery, guidelines, to, treat, civilians, who, had, suffered, blunt, or, penetrating, skull, injuries, iranian, physicians, experience, in, the, war, informed, the, medical, care, of, u, s, congresswoman, gabby, giffords, after, the, 2011, tucson, shooting, in, addition, to, helping, trigger, the, persian, gulf, war, the, iran, iraq, war, also, contributed, to, iraq, s, defeat, in, the, persian, gulf, war, iraq, s, military, was, accustomed, to, fighting, the, slow, moving, iranian, infantry, formations, with, artillery, and, static, defenses, while, using, mostly, unsophisticated, tanks, to, gun, down, and, shell, the, infantry, and, overwhelm, the, smaller, iranian, tank, force, in, addition, to, being, dependent, on, weapons, of, mass, destruction, to, help, secure, victories, therefore, they, were, rapidly, overwhelmed, by, the, high, tech, quick, maneuvering, coalition, forces, using, modern, doctrines, such, as, airland, battle, at, first, saddam, attempted, to, ensure, that, the, iraqi, population, suffered, from, the, war, as, little, as, possible, there, was, rationing, but, civilian, projects, begun, before, the, war, continued, at, the, same, time, the, already, extensive, personality, cult, around, saddam, reached, new, heights, while, the, regime, tightened, its, control, over, the, military, after, the, iranian, victories, of, the, spring, of, 1982, and, the, syrian, closure, of, iraq, s, main, pipeline, saddam, did, a, volte, face, on, his, policy, towards, the, home, front, a, policy, of, austerity, and, total, war, was, introduced, with, the, entire, population, being, mobilised, for, the, war, effort, all, iraqis, were, ordered, to, donate, blood, and, around, 100, 000, iraqi, civilians, were, ordered, to, clear, the, reeds, in, the, southern, marshes, mass, demonstrations, of, loyalty, towards, saddam, became, more, common, saddam, also, began, implementing, a, policy, of, discrimination, against, iraqis, of, iranian, origin, in, the, summer, of, 1982, saddam, began, a, campaign, of, terror, more, than, 300, iraqi, army, officers, were, executed, for, their, failures, on, the, battlefield, in, 1983, a, major, crackdown, was, launched, on, the, leadership, of, the, shia, community, ninety, members, of, the, al, hakim, family, an, influential, family, of, shia, clerics, whose, leading, members, were, the, migr, s, mohammad, baqir, al, hakim, and, abdul, aziz, al, hakim, were, arrested, and, 6, were, hanged, the, crackdown, on, kurds, saw, 8, 000, members, of, the, barzani, clan, whose, leader, massoud, barzani, also, led, the, kurdistan, democratic, party, similarly, executed, from, 1983, onwards, a, campaign, of, increasingly, brutal, repression, was, started, against, the, iraqi, kurds, characterised, by, israeli, historian, efraim, karsh, as, having, assumed, genocidal, proportions, by, 1988, the, al, anfal, campaign, was, intended, to, pacify, iraqi, kurdistan, permanently, by, 1983, the, barzanis, entered, an, alliance, with, iran, in, defense, against, saddam, hussein, to, secure, the, loyalty, of, the, shia, population, saddam, allowed, more, shias, into, the, ba, ath, party, and, the, government, and, improved, shia, living, standards, which, had, been, lower, than, those, of, the, iraqi, sunnis, saddam, had, the, state, pay, for, restoring, imam, ali, s, tomb, with, white, marble, imported, from, italy, the, baathists, also, increased, their, policies, of, repression, against, the, shia, the, most, infamous, event, was, the, massacre, of, 148, civilians, of, the, shia, town, of, dujail, despite, the, costs, of, the, war, the, iraqi, regime, made, generous, contributions, to, shia, waqf, religious, endowments, as, part, of, the, price, of, buying, iraqi, shia, support, 75, 76, the, importance, of, winning, shia, support, was, such, that, welfare, services, in, shia, areas, were, expanded, during, a, time, in, which, the, iraqi, regime, was, pursuing, austerity, in, all, other, non, military, fields, 76, during, the, first, years, of, the, war, in, the, early, 1980s, the, iraqi, government, tried, to, accommodate, the, kurds, in, order, to, focus, on, the, war, against, iran, in, 1983, the, patriotic, union, of, kurdistan, agreed, to, cooperate, with, baghdad, but, the, kurdistan, democratic, party, kdp, remained, opposed, in, 1983, saddam, signed, an, autonomy, agreement, with, jalal, talabani, of, the, patriotic, union, of, kurdistan, puk, though, saddam, later, reneged, on, the, agreement, by, 1985, the, puk, and, kdp, had, joined, forces, and, iraqi, kurdistan, saw, widespread, guerrilla, warfare, up, to, the, end, of, the, war, israeli, british, historian, ephraim, karsh, argued, that, the, iranian, government, saw, the, outbreak, of, war, as, chance, to, strengthen, its, position, and, consolidate, the, islamic, revolution, noting, that, government, propaganda, presented, it, domestically, as, a, glorious, jihad, and, a, test, of, iranian, national, character, the, iranian, regime, followed, a, policy, of, total, war, from, the, beginning, and, attempted, to, mobilise, the, nation, as, a, whole, they, established, a, group, known, as, the, reconstruction, campaign, whose, members, were, exempted, from, conscription, and, were, instead, sent, into, the, countryside, to, work, on, farms, to, replace, the, men, serving, at, the, front, iranian, workers, had, a, day, s, pay, deducted, from, their, pay, cheques, every, month, to, help, finance, the, war, and, mass, campaigns, were, launched, to, encourage, the, public, to, donate, food, money, and, blood, to, further, help, finance, the, war, the, iranian, government, banned, the, import, of, all, non, essential, items, and, launched, a, major, effort, to, rebuild, the, damaged, oil, plants, according, to, former, iraqi, general, ra, ad, al, hamdani, the, iraqis, believed, that, in, addition, to, the, arab, revolts, the, revolutionary, guards, would, be, drawn, out, of, tehran, leading, to, a, counter, revolution, in, iran, that, would, cause, khomeini, s, government, to, collapse, and, thus, ensure, iraqi, victory, however, rather, than, turning, against, the, revolutionary, government, as, experts, had, predicted, iran, s, people, including, iranian, arabs, rallied, in, support, of, the, country, and, put, up, a, stiff, resistance, the, irgc, grew, as, an, organization, to, encompass, not, just, military, concerns, but, also, matters, of, economic, religious, and, educational, importance, the, organization, s, growth, during, the, war, is, vital, to, understanding, the, organization, s, role, in, iranian, society, and, how, it, has, evolved, since, its, initial, formation, in, 1979, domestically, the, irgc, dealt, with, suppressing, uprisings, by, kurds, baluchs, turkmen, and, the, mojahedin, e, khalq, mek, which, broke, with, khomeini, in, june, 1981, while, initially, dealing, with, internal, threats, to, the, revolution, in, its, first, few, years, the, irgc, focused, its, attention, on, external, threats, at, the, outbreak, of, the, war, in, 1980, in, january, of, 1981, the, irgc, would, take, control, of, the, basij, to, aid, in, the, fight, against, iraqi, forces, the, basij, helped, bolster, the, prominence, and, legitimacy, of, the, irgc, during, the, war, as, a, vehicle, for, indoctrination, and, through, its, contributions, to, the, defense, of, iran, the, transformation, of, the, irgc, organized, its, command, structure, which, allowed, for, the, organization, to, match, the, force, of, iran, s, regular, military, and, its, first, abroad, deployment, during, the, war, began, the, sponsoring, of, other, armed, groups, in, the, region, through, its, command, of, the, quds, force, in, june, 1981, street, battles, broke, out, between, the, revolutionary, guard, and, the, left, wing, mujaheddin, e, khalq, mek, continuing, for, several, days, and, killing, hundreds, on, both, sides, 250, in, september, more, unrest, broke, out, on, the, streets, of, iran, as, the, mek, attempted, to, seize, power, thousands, of, left, wing, iranians, many, of, whom, were, not, associated, with, the, mek, were, shot, and, hanged, by, the, government, 251, the, mek, began, an, assassination, campaign, that, killed, hundreds, of, regime, officials, by, the, fall, of, 1981, 251, on, 28, june, 1981, they, assassinated, the, secretary, general, of, the, islamic, republican, party, mohammad, beheshti, and, on, 30, august, killed, iran, s, president, mohammad, ali, rajai, 251, the, government, responded, with, mass, executions, of, suspected, mek, members, a, practice, that, lasted, until, 1985, in, addition, to, the, open, civil, conflict, with, the, mek, the, iranian, government, was, faced, with, iraqi, supported, rebellions, in, iranian, kurdistan, which, were, gradually, put, down, through, a, campaign, of, systematic, repression, 1985, also, saw, student, anti, war, demonstrations, which, were, crushed, by, government, forces, in, september, 2020, ali, fadavi, announced, that, iran, spent, 19, 6, billion, in, the, war, the, war, furthered, the, decline, of, the, iranian, economy, that, had, begun, with, the, revolution, in, 1978, 79, between, 1979, and, 1981, foreign, exchange, reserves, fell, from, 14, 6, billion, to, 1, billion, as, a, result, of, the, war, living, standards, dropped, dramatically, 252, and, iran, was, described, by, british, journalists, john, bulloch, and, harvey, morris, as, a, dour, and, joyless, place, ruled, by, a, harsh, regime, that, seemed, to, have, nothing, to, offer, but, endless, war, 239, though, iran, was, becoming, bankrupt, khomeini, interpreted, islam, s, prohibition, of, usury, to, mean, they, could, not, borrow, against, future, oil, revenues, to, meet, war, expenses, as, a, result, iran, funded, the, war, by, the, income, from, oil, exports, after, cash, had, run, out, the, revenue, from, oil, dropped, from, 20, billion, in, 1982, to, 5, billion, in, 1988, 252, french, historian, pierre, razoux, argued, that, this, sudden, drop, in, economic, industrial, potential, in, conjunction, with, the, increasing, aggression, of, iraq, placed, iran, in, a, challenging, position, that, had, little, leeway, other, than, accepting, iraq, s, conditions, of, peace, in, january, 1985, former, prime, minister, and, anti, war, islamic, liberation, movement, co, founder, mehdi, bazargan, criticised, the, war, in, a, telegram, to, the, united, nations, calling, it, un, islamic, and, illegitimate, and, arguing, that, khomeini, should, have, accepted, saddam, s, truce, offer, in, 1982, instead, of, attempting, to, overthrow, the, ba, ath, in, a, public, letter, to, khomeini, sent, in, may, 1988, he, added, since, 1986, you, have, not, stopped, proclaiming, victory, and, now, you, are, calling, upon, population, to, resist, until, victory, is, that, not, an, admission, of, failure, on, your, part, 252, khomeini, was, annoyed, by, bazargan, s, telegram, and, issued, a, lengthy, public, rebuttal, in, which, he, defended, the, war, as, both, islamic, and, just, by, 1987, iranian, morale, had, begun, to, crumble, reflected, in, the, failure, of, government, campaigns, to, recruit, martyrs, for, the, front, israeli, historian, efraim, karsh, points, to, the, decline, in, morale, in, 1987, 88, as, being, a, major, factor, in, iran, s, decision, to, accept, the, ceasefire, of, 1988, not, all, saw, the, war, in, negative, terms, the, islamic, revolution, of, iran, was, strengthened, and, radicalised, the, iranian, government, owned, etelaat, newspaper, wrote, there, is, not, a, single, school, or, town, that, is, excluded, from, the, happiness, of, holy,

army, had, been, purged, after, the, 1979, revolution, with, most, high, ranking, officers, either, having, fled, the, country, or, been, executed, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, iraq, held, a, clear, advantage, in, armour, while, both, nations, were, roughly, equal, in, terms, of, artillery, the, gap, only, widened, as, the, war, went, on, iran, started, with, a, stronger, air, force, but, over, time, the, balance, of, power, reversed, in, iraq, s, favour, as, iraq, was, constantly, expanding, its, military, while, iran, was, under, arms, sanctions, estimates, for, 1980, and, 1987, were, the, conflict, has, been, compared, to, world, war, i, 171, in, terms, of, the, tactics, used, including, large, scale, trench, warfare, with, barbed, wire, stretched, across, trenches, manned, machine, gun, posts, bayonet, charges, human, wave, attacks, across, a, no, man, s, land, and, extensive, use, of, chemical, weapons, such, as, sulfur, mustard, by, the, iraqi, government, against, iranian, troops, civilians, and, kurds, the, world, powers, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, together, with, many, western, and, arab, countries, provided, military, intelligence, economic, and, political, support, for, iraq, on, average, iraq, imported, about, 7, billion, in, weapons, during, every, year, of, the, war, accounting, for, fully, 12, of, global, arms, sales, in, the, period, the, value, of, iraqi, arms, imports, increased, to, between, 12, billion, and, 14, billion, during, 1984, 1987, whereas, the, value, of, iranian, arms, imports, fell, from, 14, billion, in, 1985, to, 5, 89, billion, in, 1986, and, an, estimated, 6, billion, to, 8, billion, in, 1987, iran, was, constrained, by, the, price, of, oil, during, the, 1980s, oil, glut, as, foreign, countries, were, largely, unwilling, to, extend, credit, to, iran, but, iraq, financed, its, continued, massive, military, expansion, by, taking, on, vast, quantities, of, debt, that, allowed, it, to, win, a, number, of, victories, against, iran, near, the, end, of, the, war, but, that, left, the, country, bankrupt, despite, its, larger, population, by, 1988, iran, s, ground, forces, numbered, only, 600, 000, whereas, the, iraqi, army, had, grown, to, include, 1, million, soldiers, during, the, war, iraq, was, regarded, by, the, west, and, the, soviet, union, as, a, counterbalance, to, post, revolutionary, iran, 119, the, soviet, union, iraq, s, main, arms, supplier, during, the, war, did, not, wish, for, the, end, of, its, alliance, with, iraq, and, was, alarmed, by, saddam, s, threats, to, find, new, arms, suppliers, in, the, west, and, china, if, the, kremlin, did, not, provide, him, with, the, weapons, he, wanted, 119, 198, 199, the, soviet, union, hoped, to, use, the, threat, of, reducing, arms, supplies, to, iraq, as, leverage, for, forming, a, soviet, iranian, alliance, 197, during, the, early, years, of, the, war, the, united, states, lacked, meaningful, relations, with, either, iran, or, iraq, the, former, due, to, the, iranian, revolution, and, the, iran, hostage, crisis, and, the, latter, because, of, iraq, s, alliance, with, the, soviet, union, and, hostility, towards, israel, following, iran, s, success, in, repelling, the, iraqi, invasion, and, khomeini, s, refusal, to, end, the, war, in, 1982, the, united, states, made, an, outreach, to, iraq, beginning, with, the, restoration, of, diplomatic, relations, in, 1984, the, united, states, wished, to, both, keep, iran, away, from, soviet, influence, and, protect, other, gulf, states, from, any, threat, of, iranian, expansion, as, a, result, the, u, s, began, to, provide, limited, support, to, iraq, 142, 143, in, 1982, henry, kissinger, former, secretary, of, state, outlined, u, s, policy, towards, iran, the, focus, of, iranian, pressure, at, this, moment, is, iraq, there, are, few, governments, in, the, world, less, deserving, of, our, support, and, less, capable, of, using, it, had, iraq, won, the, war, the, fear, in, the, gulf, and, the, threat, to, our, interest, would, be, scarcely, less, than, it, is, today, still, given, the, importance, of, the, balance, of, power, in, the, area, it, is, in, our, interests, to, promote, a, ceasefire, in, that, conflict, though, not, a, cost, that, will, preclude, an, eventual, rapprochement, with, iran, either, if, a, more, moderate, regime, replaces, khomeini, s, or, if, the, present, rulers, wake, up, to, geopolitical, reality, that, the, historic, threat, to, iran, s, independence, has, always, come, from, the, country, with, which, it, shares, a, border, of, 1, 500, miles, the, soviet, union, a, rapprochement, with, iran, of, course, must, await, at, a, minimum, iran, s, abandonment, of, hegemonic, aspirations, in, the, gulf, 142, 143, richard, murphy, assistant, secretary, of, state, during, the, war, testified, to, congress, in, 1984, that, the, reagan, administration, believed, a, victory, for, either, iran, or, iraq, was, neither, militarily, feasible, nor, strategically, desirable, 178, support, to, iraq, was, given, via, technological, aid, intelligence, the, sale, of, dual, use, chemical, and, biological, warfare, related, technology, and, military, equipment, and, satellite, intelligence, while, there, was, direct, combat, between, iran, and, the, united, states, it, is, not, universally, agreed, that, the,

to, support, was, summed, up, by, henry, kissinger, when, he, remarked, it, s, a, pity, they, can, t, both, lose, the, americans, and, the, british, also, either, blocked, or, watered, down, un, resolutions, that, condemned, iraq, for, using, chemical, weapons, against, the, iranians, and, their, own, kurdish, citizens, more, than, 30, countries, provided, support, to, iraq, iran, or, both, most, of, the, aid, went, to, iraq, iran, had, a, complex, clandestine, procurement, network, to, obtain, munitions, and, critical, materials, iraq, had, an, even, larger, clandestine, purchasing,

french, officials, the, new, york, times, reported, france, had, been, sending, chemical, precursors, of, chemical, weapons, to, iraq, since, 1986, china, which, had, no, direct, stake, in, the, victory, of, either, side, and, whose, interests, in, the, war, were, entirely, commercial, freely, sold, arms, to, both, sides, 185, 187, 188, 192, 193, iraq, also, made, extensive, use, of, front, companies, middlemen, secret, ownership, of, all, or, part, of, companies, all, over, the, world, forged, end, user, certificates, and, other, methods, to, hide, what, it, was, acquiring, some,

the, call, on, later, occasions, however, the, un, did, not, come, to, iran, s, aid, to, repel, the, iraqi, invasion, and, the, iranians, thus, interpreted, the, un, as, subtly, biased, in, favour,

became, known, as, the, iran, contra, affair, these, secret, sales, were, partly, to, help, secure, the, release, of, hostages, held, in, lebanon, and, partly, to, make, money, to, help, the, contras,

1985, total, sales, of, u, s, dual, use, technology, to, iraq, are, estimated, at, 500, million, u, s, government, support, for, iraq, was, not, a, secret, and, was, frequently, discussed, in, open, sessions, of, the, senate, and, house, of, representatives, american, views, toward, iraq, were, not, enthusiastically, supportive, in, its, conflict, with, iran, and, activity, in, assistance, was,

security, planning, group, meeting, was, called, chaired, by, vice, president, george, bush, to, review, u, s, options, it, was, determined, that, there, was, a, high, likelihood, that, the, conflict, would, spread, into, saudi, arabia, and, other, gulf, states, but, that, the, united, states, had, little, capability, to, defend, the, region, it, was, determined, that, a, prolonged, war, in, the,

initial, claims, by, the, iraqi, government, that, stark, was, inside, the, iran, iraq, war, zone, were, shown, to, be, false, and, the, motives, and, orders, of, the, pilot, remain, unanswered, though, american, officials, claimed, that, the, pilot, who, attacked, stark, had, been, executed, an, ex, iraqi, air, force, commander, since, stated, he, had, not, been, punished, and, was, still, alive, at, the, time, the, attack, remains, the, only, successful, anti, ship, missile, strike, on, an, american, warship, due, to, the, extensive, political, and, military, cooperation, between, the, iraqis, and, americans, by, 1987, the, attack, had, little, effect, on, relations, between, the, two, countries, u, s, attention, was, focused, on, isolating, iran, as, well, as, maintaining, freedom, of, navigation, it, criticised, iran, s, mining, of, international, waters, and, sponsored, un, security, council, resolution, 598, which, passed, unanimously, on, 20, july, under, which, the, u, s,

vincennes, shot, down, iran, air, flight, 655, on, 3, july, 1988, killing, all, 290, passengers, and, crew, on, board, the, american, government, claimed, that, vincennes, was, in, international, waters, at, the, time, which, was, later, proven, to, be, untrue, that, the, airbus, a300, had, been, mistaken, for, an, iranian, f, 14, tomcat, and, that, vincennes, feared, that, she, was, under, attack, 260, 273, the, iranians, maintain, that, vincennes, was, in, their, own, waters, and, that, the, passenger, jet, was, turning, away, and, increasing, altitude, after, take, off, u, s, admiral, william, j, crowe, later, admitted, on, nightline, that, vincennes, was, in, iranian, territorial, waters, when, it, launched, the, missiles, at, the, time, of, the, attack, admiral, crowe, claimed, that, the, iranian, plane, did, not, identify, itself, and, sent, no, response, to, warning, signals, he, had, sent, in, 1996, the, united, states, expressed, their, regret, for, the, event, and, the, civilian, deaths, it, caused, in, a, declassified, 1991, report, the, cia, estimated, that, iran, had, suffered, more, than, 50, 000, casualties, from, iraq, s, use, of, several, chemical, weapons, though, current, estimates, are, more, than, 100, 000, as, the, long, term, effects, continue, to, cause, casualties, the, official, cia, estimate, did, not, include, the, civilian, population, contaminated, in, bordering, towns, or, the, children, and, relatives, of, veterans, many, of, whom, have, developed, blood, lung, and, skin, complications, according, to, the, organization, for, veterans, of, iran, according, to, a, 2002, article, in, the, star, ledger, 20, 000, iranian, soldiers, were, killed, on, the, spot, by, nerve, gas, as, of, 2002, 5, 000, of, the, 80, 000, survivors, continue, to, seek, regular, medical, treatment, while, 1, 000, are, hospital, inpatients, according, to, iraqi, documents, assistance, in, developing, chemical, weapons, was, obtained, from, firms, in, many, countries, including, the, united, states, west, germany, the, netherlands, the, united, kingdom, and, france, a, report, stated, that, dutch, australian, italian, french, and, both, west, and, east, german, companies, were, involved, in, the, export, of, raw, materials, to, iraqi, chemical, weapons, factories, declassified, cia, documents, show, that, the, united, states, was, providing, reconnaissance, intelligence, to, iraq, around, 1987, 88, which, was, then, used, to, launch, chemical, weapon, attacks, on, iranian, troops, and, that, the, cia, fully, knew, that, chemical, weapons, would, be, deployed, and, sarin, and, cyclosarin, attacks, followed, on, 21, march, 1986, the, united, nations, security, council, made, a, declaration, stating, that, members, are, profoundly, concerned, by, the, unanimous, conclusion, of, the, specialists, that, chemical, weapons, on, many, occasions, have, been, used, by, iraqi, forces, against, iranian, troops, and, the, members, of, the, council, strongly, condemn, this, continued, use, of, chemical, weapons, in, clear, violation, of, the, geneva, protocol, of, 1925, which, prohibits, the, use, in, war, of, chemical, weapons, the, united, states, was, the, only, member, who, voted, against, the, issuance, of, this, statement, a, mission, to, the, region, in, 1988, found, evidence, of, the, use, of, chemical, weapons, and, was, condemned, in, security, council, resolution, 612, according, to, w, patrick, lang, senior, defense, intelligence, officer, at, the, u, s, defense, intelligence, agency, the, use, of, gas, on, the, battlefield, by, the, iraqis, was, not, a, matter, of, deep, strategic, concern, to, reagan, and, his, aides, because, they, were, desperate, to, make, sure, that, iraq, did, not, lose, he, claimed, that, the, defense, intelligence, agency, would, have, never, accepted, the, use, of, chemical, weapons, against, civilians, but, the, use, against, military, objectives, was, seen, as, inevitable, in, the, iraqi, struggle, for, survival, the, reagan, administration, did, not, stop, aiding, iraq, after, receiving, reports, of, the, use, of, poison, gas, on, kurdish, civilians, the, united, states, accused, iran, of, using, chemical, weapons, as, well, 214, though, the, allegations, have, been, disputed, joost, hiltermann, the, principal, researcher, for, human, rights, watch, between, 1992, and, 1994, conducted, a, two, year, study, that, included, a, field, investigation, in, iraq, and, obtained, iraqi, government, documents, in, the, process, according, to, hiltermann, the, literature, on, the, iran, iraq, war, reflects, allegations, of, chemical, weapons, used, by, iran, but, they, are, marred, by, a, lack, of, specificity, as, to, time, and, place, and, the, failure, to, provide, any, sort, of, evidence, 153, analysts, gary, sick, and, lawrence, potter, have, called, the, allegations, against, iran, mere, assertions, and, stated, no, persuasive, evidence, of, the, claim, that, iran, was, the, primary, culprit, was, ever, presented, 156, policy, consultant, and, author, joseph, tragert, stated, iran, did, not, retaliate, with, chemical, weapons, probably, because, it, did, not, possess, any, at, the, time, documents, uncovered, after, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, show, that, iraqi, military, intelligence, was, not, aware, of, any, large, scale, chemical, attacks, by, iranian, forces, although, a, march, 1987, document, describes, five, small, scale, chemical, attacks, perpetrated, by, the, iranians, four, involving, mustard, gas, and, one, involving, phosgene, with, the, likely, source, being, captured, iraqi, munitions, and, there, are, also, reports, of, iranian, use, of, tear, gas, and, white, phosphorus, at, his, trial, in, december, 2006, saddam, said, he, would, take, responsibility, with, honour, for, any, attacks, on, iran, using, conventional, or, chemical, weapons, during, the, war, but, that, he, took, issue, with, the, charges, that, he, ordered, attacks, on, iraqis, a, medical, analysis, of, the, effects, of, iraqi, mustard, gas, is, described, in, a, u, s, military, textbook, and, contrasted, effects, of, world, war, i, gas, at, the, time, of, the, conflict, the, united, nations, security, council, issued, statements, that, chemical, weapons, had, been, used, in, the, war, un, statements, never, clarified, that, only, iraq, was, using, chemical, weapons, and, according, to, retrospective, authors, the, international, community, remained, silent, as, iraq, used, weapons, of, mass, destruction, against, iranian, as, well, as, iraqi, kurds, a, 1987, un, report, conducted, at, the, behest, of, both, belligerents, discovered, weapon, fragments, that, established, iraqi, responsibility, for, chemical, attacks, on, iranian, soldiers, and, civilians, but, could, not, substantiate, iraq, s, allegations, of, iranian, chemical, weapons, use, iraqi, forces, have, been, affected, by, mustard, gas, and, a, pulmonary, element, possibly, phosgene, in, the, absence, of, conclusive, evidence, of, the, weapons, used, it, could, not, be, determined, how, the, injuries, were, caused, evidence, suggests, that, these, iraqi, chemical, casualties, were, likely, the, result, of, blowback, whereas, the, evidence, that, iraq, submitted, to, the, un, such, as, two, iranian, 130, mm, shells, that, un, specialists, found, had, no, internal, chemical, resistant, coating, and, were, normally, used, for, filling, with, high, explosives, did, not, withstand, scrutiny, un, official, iqbal, riza, later, acknowledged, that, iraq, s, evidence, was, clearly, fabricated, however, the, report, s, phrasing, chemical, weapons, were, again, used, against, iranian, forces, by, iraqi, forces, now, also, iraqi, forces, have, sustained, injuries, from, chemical, warfare, contributed, to, an, erroneous, perception, that, iran, and, iraq, were, equally, at, fault, in, response, to, further, iraqi, chemical, attacks, on, kurdish, civilians, after, the, august, 1988, ceasefire, with, iran, united, states, senators, claiborne, pell, and, jesse, helms, called, for, comprehensive, economic, sanctions, against, iraq, including, an, oil, embargo, and, severe, limitations, on, the, export, of, dual, use, technology, although, the, ensuing, legislation, passed, in, the, u, s, senate, it, faced, strong, opposition, within, the, house, of, representatives, and, did, not, become, law, in, a, rare, rebuke, secretary, of, state, george, shultz, condemned, iraq, s, unjustified, and, abhorrent, chemical, attacks, which, shultz, s, assistant, charles, e, redman, characterized, as, unacceptable, to, the, civilized, world, even, after, these, pronouncements, however, the, state, department, advised, against, sanctions, bruce, riedel, describes, the, iran, iraq, war, as, one, of, the, largest, and, longest, conventional, interstate, wars, of, the, twentieth, century, and, the, only, war, in, modern, times, in, which, chemical, weapons, were, used, on, a, massive, scale, kanan, makiya, writes, that, there, has, not, been, anything, like, it, in, the, long, history, of, iraqi, iranian, relations, just, like, there, had, been, nothing, like, world, war, i, in, the, history, of, europe, iran, s, attack, on, the, osirak, nuclear, reactor, in, september, 1980, was, the, first, attack, on, a, nuclear, reactor, and, one, of, only, a, small, handful, of, military, attacks, on, nuclear, facilities, in, history, it, was, also, the, first, instance, of, a, pre, emptive, attack, on, a, nuclear, reactor, to, forestall, the, development, of, a, nuclear, weapon, though, it, did, not, achieve, its, objective, as, france, repaired, the, reactor, after, the, attack, it, took, a, second, pre, emptive, strike, by, the, israeli, air, force, in, june, 1981, to, disable, the, reactor, killing, a, french, engineer, in, the, process, and, causing, france, to, pull, out, of, osirak, the, decommissioning, of, osirak, has, been, cited, as, causing, a, substantial, delay, to, iraqi, acquisition, of, nuclear, weapons, the, iran, iraq, war, was, the, first, conflict, in, the, history, of, warfare, in, which, both, forces, used, ballistic, missiles, against, each, other, this, war, also, saw, the, only, confirmed, air, to, air, helicopter, battles, in, history, with, the, iraqi, mi, 25s, flying, against, iranian, ah, 1j, seacobras, supplied, by, the, united, states, before, the, iranian, revolution, on, several, separate, occasions, in, november, 1980, not, long, after, iraq, s, initial, invasion, of, iran, two, iranian, seacobras, engaged, two, mi, 25s, with, tow, wire, guided, antitank, missiles, one, mi, 25, went, down, immediately, the, other, was, badly, damaged, and, crashed, before, reaching, base, the, iranians, repeated, this, accomplishment, on, 24, april, 1981, destroying, two, mi, 25s, without, incurring, losses, to, themselves, one, mi, 25, was, also, downed, by, an, iranian, f, 14a, tomcat, the, iraqis, hit, back, claiming, the, destruction, of, a, seacobra, on, 14, september, 1983, with, yakb, machine, gun, then, three, seacobras, on, 5, february, 1984, and, three, more, on, 25, february, 1984, two, with, falanga, missiles, one, with, s, 5, rockets, after, a, lull, in, helicopter, losses, each, side, lost, a, gunship, on, 13, february, 1986, later, a, mi, 25, claimed, a, seacobra, shot, down, with, yakb, gun, on, 16, february, and, a, seacobra, claimed, a, mi, 25, shot, down, with, rockets, on, 18, february, the, last, engagement, between, the, two, types, was, on, 22, may, 1986, when, mi, 25s, shot, down, a, seacobra, the, final, claim, tally, was, 10, seacobras, and, 6, mi, 25s, destroyed, the, relatively, small, numbers, and, the, inevitable, disputes, over, actual, kill, numbers, makes, it, unclear, if, one, gunship, had, a, real, technical, superiority, over, the, other, iraqi, mi, 25s, also, claimed, 43, kills, against, other, iranian, helicopters, such, as, agusta, bell, uh, 1, hueys, both, sides, especially, iraq, also, carried, out, air, and, missile, attacks, against, population, centres, in, october, 1986, iraqi, aircraft, began, to, attack, civilian, passenger, trains, and, aircraft, on, iranian, soil, including, an, iran, air, boeing, 737, unloading, passengers, at, shiraz, international, airport, in, retaliation, for, the, iranian, operation, karbala, 5, iraq, attacked, 65, cities, in, 226, sorties, over, 42, days, bombing, civilian, neighbourhoods, eight, iranian, cities, came, under, attack, from, iraqi, missiles, the, bombings, killed, 65, children, in, an, elementary, school, in, borujerd, the, iranians, responded, with, scud, missile, attacks, on, baghdad, and, struck, a, primary, school, there, these, events, became, known, as, the, war, of, the, cities, the, war, of, the, cities, resumed, and, peaked, in, 1988, when, iraq, dropped, 40, tons, of, high, explosives, on, tehran, using, modified, scud, missiles, dubbed, al, husayn, missiles, over, seven, weeks, causing, panic, among, civilians, and, prompting, almost, 1, million, residents, of, tehran, to, temporarily, flee, their, homes, nevertheless, scholars, have, noted, that, this, still, ranks, as, one, of, the, smallest, strategic, bombing, campaigns, in, history, paling, in, comparison, to, strategic, bombing, during, world, war, ii, which, saw, 1, 2, million, tons, of, bombs, dropped, on, german, cities, in, 1944, alone, or, more, recent, events, such, as, the, so, called, christmas, bombings, of, north, vietnam, which, saw, 20, 000, tons, of, bombs, dropped, on, hanoi, and, haiphong, in, a, mere, eleven, days, in, total, 10, 000, 11, 000, civilians, died, as, a, result, of, the, aerial, bombardment, of, iranian, cities, with, the, majority, of, those, deaths, occurring, in, the, final, year, of, the, war, despite, the, war, iran, and, iraq, maintained, diplomatic, relations, and, embassies, in, each, other, s, countries, until, mid, 1987, iran, s, government, used, human, waves, to, attack, enemy, troops, and, even, in, some, cases, to, clear, minefields, children, volunteered, as, well, some, reports, mistakenly, have, the, basijis, marching, into, battle, while, marking, their, expected, entry, to, heaven, by, wearing, plastic, keys, to, paradise, around, their, necks, although, other, analysts, regard, this, story, as, a, hoax, involving, a, misinterpretation, of, the, carrying, of, a, prayer, book, called, the, keys, to, paradise, mafatih, al, janan, by, sheikh, abbas, qumi, given, to, all, volunteers, according, to, journalist, robin, wright, during, the, fateh, offensive, in, february, 1987, i, toured, the, southwest, front, on, the, iranian, side, and, saw, scores, of, boys, aged, anywhere, from, nine, to, sixteen, who, said, with, staggering, and, seemingly, genuine, enthusiasm, that, they, had, volunteered, to, become, martyrs, regular, army, troops, the, paramilitary, revolutionary, guards, and, mullahs, all, lauded, these, youths, known, as, baseeji, for, having, played, the, most, dangerous, role, in, breaking, through, iraqi, lines, they, had, led, the, way, running, over, fields, of, mines, to, clear, the, ground, for, the, iranian, ground, assault, wearing, white, headbands, to, signify, the, embracing, of, death, and, shouting, shaheed, shaheed, martyr, martyr, they, literally, blew, their, way, into, heaven, their, numbers, were, never, disclosed, but, a, walk, through, the, residential, suburbs, of, iranian, cities, provided, a, clue, window, after, window, block, after, block, displayed, black, bordered, photographs, of, teenage, or, preteen, youths, the, relationship, between, iraq, and, iran, has, warmed, immensely, since, the, downfall, of, saddam, hussein, out, of, mostly, pragmatic, interests, as, they, share, a, common, enemy, in, the, islamic, state, significant, military, assistance, has, been, provided, by, iran, to, iraq, resulting, in, iran, holding, a, large, amount, of, political, influence, in, iraq, s, newly, elected, shia, government, iraq, is, also, heavily, dependent, on, the, more, stable, and, developed, iran, for, its, energy, needs, so, a, stable, iraq, is, an, interest, for, iran, foreign, policy, wise, the, iran, iraq, war, is, regarded, as, being, a, major, trigger, for, rising, sectarianism, in, the, region, as, it, was, viewed, by, many, as, a, clash, between, sunni, muslims, ba, athist, iraq, and, other, arab, states, and, the, shia, revolutionaries, that, had, recently, taken, power, in, iran, there, remains, lingering, animosity, however, despite, the, pragmatic, alliance, that, has, been, formed, as, multiple, government, declarations, from, iran, have, stated, that, the, war, will, affect, every, issue, of, internal, and, foreign, policy, for, decades, to, come, the, sustained, importance, of, this, conflict, is, attributed, mostly, to, the, massive, human, and, economic, cost, resulting, from, it, along, with, its, ties, to, the, iranian, revolution, another, significant, effect, that, the, war, has, on, iran, s, policy, is, the, issue, of, remaining, war, reparations, the, un, estimates, that, iraq, owes, about, 149, billion, while, iran, contends, that, with, both, the, direct, and, indirect, effects, taken, into, account, the, cost, of, the, war, reaches, a, trillion, iran, has, not, vocalized, the, desire, for, these, reparations, in, recent, years, and, has, even, suggested, forms, of, financial, aid, this, is, due, most, likely, to, iran, s, interest, in, keeping, iraq, politically, stable, and, imposing, these, reparation, costs, would, further, burden, the, already, impoverished, nation, the, most, important, factor, that, governs, iraq, s, current, foreign, policy, is, the, national, government, s, consistent, fragility, following, the, overthrow, of, saddam, hussein, iraq, s, need, for, any, and, all, allies, that, can, help, bring, stability, and, bring, development, has, allowed, iran, to, exert, significant, influence, over, the, new, iraqi, state, despite, lingering, memories, of, the, war, currently, iraq, is, between, two, opposing, interests, one, with, iran, who, can, provide, a, reliable, source, of, power, as, well, as, military, support, to, the, influential, shia, militias, and, political, factions, and, the, other, with, the, united, states, who, can, offer, iraq, significant, economic, aid, packages, along, with, military, support, in, the, form, of, air, and, artillery, strikes, if, iraq, is, seen, to, be, pulled, too, far, into, one, side, s, orbit, then, the, benefits, offered, to, them, by, the, other, side, will, likely, be, gradually, reduced, or, cut, off, completely, another, significant, factor, influencing, relations, is, the, shared, cultural, interests, of, iraq, and, iran, s, citizens, to, freely, visit, the, multitude, of, holy, sites, located, in, each, country, the, war, is, known, in, iran, as, the, def, e, moqaddas, sacred, defence, and, the, jang, e, tahmili, the, imposed, war, the, war, is, known, in, the, arab, world, and, a, few, other, regions, as, the, first, gulf, war, arabic, that, name, or, simply, the, gulf, war, was, used, by, western, sources, also, until, it, was, used, to, refer, to, the, conflict, between, the, american, led, coalition, and, iraq, in, 1991, the, iran, iraq, war, was, rarely, referred, to, as, the, persian, gulf, war, until, the, 1990, 1991, persian, gulf, war, after, which, the, previous, war, was, dubbed, the, first, persian, gulf, war, besides, the, iran, iraq, war, the, 1990, iraq, kuwait, conflict, as, well, as, the, iraq, war, from, 2003, to, 2011, have, all, been, called, the, second, persian, gulf, war, state, media, in, iraq, dubbed, the, war, saddam, s, qadisiyyah, q, disiyyat, add, m, in, reference, to, the, seventh, century, battle, of, al, q, disiyyah, in, which, arab, warriors, overcame, the, sasanian, empire, during, the, muslim, conquest, of, iran, we, are, armed, with, allahu, akbar, the, 1979, iranian, islamic, revolutionary, military, march, song, performed, by, irgc, troops, in, front, of, ayatollah, khomeini, in, jamaran, husinie, made, a, cultural, impact, during, the, war
