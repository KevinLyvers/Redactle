one, noble, nor, are, all, nobles, wealthy, or, influential, aristocratic, families, have, lost, their, fortunes, in, various, ways, and, the, concept, of, the, poor, nobleman, is, almost, as, old, as, nobility, itself, although, many, societies, have, a, privileged, upper, class, with, substantial, wealth, and, power, the, status, is, not, necessarily, hereditary, and, does, not, entail, a, distinct, legal, status, nor, differentiated, forms, of, address, various, republics, including, european, countries, such, as, greece, turkey, and, austria, and, former, iron, curtain, countries, and, places, in, the, americas, such, as, mexico, and, the, united, states, have, expressly, abolished, the, conferral, and, use, of, titles, of, nobility, for, their, citizens, this, is, distinct, from, countries, that, have, not, abolished, the, right, to, inherit, titles, but, which, do, not, grant, legal, recognition, or, protection, to, them, such, as, germany, and, italy, although, germany, recognizes, their, use, as, part, of, the, legal, surname, still, other, countries, and, authorities, allow, their, use, but, forbid, attachment, of, any, privilege, thereto, e, g, finland, norway, and, the, european, union, while, french, law, also, protects, lawful, titles, against, usurpation, not, all, of, the, benefits, of, nobility, derived, from, noble, status, per, se, usually,

large, or, small, that, might, include, fields, pasture, orchards, timberland, hunting, grounds, streams, etc, it, also, included, infrastructure, such, as, a, castle, well, and, mill, to, which, local, peasants, were, allowed, some, access, although, often, at, a, price, nobles, were, expected, to, live, nobly, that, is, from, the, proceeds, of, these, possessions, work, involving, manual, labor, or, subordination, to, those, of, lower, rank, with, specific, exceptions, such, as, in, military, or, ecclesiastic, service, was, either, forbidden, as, derogation, from, noble, status, or, frowned, upon, socially, on, the, other, hand, membership, in, the, nobility, was, usually, a, prerequisite, for, holding, offices, of, trust, in, the, realm, and, for, career, promotion, especially,

by, dues, and, services, but, the, exercise, of, their, rights, was, often, also, subject, to, the, jurisdiction, of, courts, and, police, from, whose, authority, the, actions, of, nobles, were, entirely, or, partially, exempt, in, some, parts, of, europe, the, right, of, private, war, long, remained, the, privilege, of, every, noble, during, the, early, renaissance, duelling, established,

largely, been, abolished, in, the, western, world, as, intrinsically, discriminatory, and, discredited, as, inferior, in, efficiency, to, individual, meritocracy, in, the, allocation, of, societal, resources, nobility, came, to, be, associated, with, social, rather, than, legal, privilege, expressed, in, a, general, expectation, of, deference, from, those, of, lower, rank, by, the, 21st, century, even, that, deference, had, become, increasingly, minimized, in, general, the, present, nobility, present, in, the, european, monarchies, has, no, more, privileges, than, the, citizens, decorated, in, republics, in, france, a, seigneurie, lordship, might, include, one, or, more, manors, surrounded, by, land, and, villages, subject, to, a, noble, s, prerogatives, and, disposition, seigneuries, could, be, bought, sold, or, mortgaged, if, erected, by, the, crown, into, e, g, a, barony, or, countship, it, became, legally, entailed, for, a, specific, family, which, could, use, it, as, their, title, yet, most, french, nobles, were, untitled, seigneur, of, montagne, simply, meant, ownership, of, that, lordship, but, not, if, one, was, not, otherwise, noble, the, right, to, use, a, title, of, nobility, as, commoners, often, purchased, lordships, only, a, member, of, the, nobility, who, owned, a, countship, was, allowed, ipso, facto, to, style, himself, as, its, comte, although, this, restriction, came, to, be, increasingly, ignored, as, the, ancien, r, gime, drew, to, its, close, in, other, parts, of, europe, sovereign, rulers, arrogated, to, themselves, the, exclusive, prerogative, to, act, as, fons, honorum, within, their, realms, for, example, in, the, united, kingdom, royal, letters, patent, are, necessary, to, obtain, a, title, of, the, peerage, which, also, carries, nobility, and, formerly, a, seat, in, the, house, of, lords, but, never, came, with, automatic, entail, of, land, nor, rights, to, the, local, peasants, output, nobility, might, be, either, inherited, or, conferred, by, a, fons, honorum, it, is, usually, an, acknowledged, preeminence, that, is, hereditary, i, e, the, status, descends, exclusively, to, some, or, all, of, the, legitimate, and, usually, male, line, descendants, of, a, nobleman, in, this, respect, the, nobility, as, a, class, has, always, been, much, more, extensive, than, the, primogeniture, based, titled, nobility, which, included, peerages, in, france, and, in, the, united, kingdom, grandezas, in, portugal, and, spain, and, some, noble, titles, in, belgium, italy, the, netherlands, prussia, and, scandinavia, in, russia, scandinavia, and, non, prussian, germany, titles, usually, descended, to, all, male, line, descendants, of, the, original, titleholder, including, females, in, spain, noble, titles, are, now, equally, heritable, by, females, and, males, alike, noble, estates, on, the, other, hand, gradually, came, to, descend, by, primogeniture, in, much, of, western, europe, aside, from, germany, in, eastern, europe, by, contrast, with, the, exception, of, a, few, hungarian, estates, they, usually, descended, to, all, sons, or, even, all, children, in, france, some, wealthy, bourgeois, most, particularly, the, members, of, the, various, parlements, were, ennobled, by, the, king, constituting, the, noblesse, de, robe, the, old, nobility, of, landed, or, knightly, origin, the, noblesse, d, p, e, increasingly, resented, the, influence, and, pretensions, of, this, parvenu, nobility, in, the, last, years, of, the, ancien, r, gime, the, old, nobility, pushed, for, restrictions, of, certain, offices, and, orders, of, chivalry, to, noblemen, who, could, demonstrate, that, their, lineage, had, extended, quarterings, i, e, several, generations, of, noble, ancestry, to, be, eligible, for, offices, and, favours, at, court, along, with, nobles, of, medieval, descent, although, historians, such, as, william, doyle, have, disputed, this, so, called, aristocratic, reaction, various, court, and, military, positions, were, reserved, by, tradition, for, nobles, who, could, prove, an, ancestry, of, at, least, seize, quartiers, 16, quarterings, indicating, exclusively, noble, descent, as, displayed, ideally, in, the, family, s, coat, of, arms, extending, back, five, generations, all, 16, great, great, grandparents, this, illustrates, the, traditional, link, in, many, countries, between, heraldry, and, nobility, in, those, countries, where, heraldry, is, used, nobles, have, almost, always, been, armigerous, and, have, used, heraldry, to, demonstrate, their, ancestry, and, family, history, however, heraldry, has, never, been, restricted, to, the, noble, classes, in, most, countries, and, being, armigerous, does, not, necessarily, demonstrate, nobility, scotland, however, is, an, exception, in, a, number, of, recent, cases, in, scotland, the, lord, lyon, king, of, arms, has, controversially, vis, vis, scotland, s, salic, law, granted, the, arms, and, allocated, the, chiefships, of, medieval, noble, families, to, female, line, descendants, of, lords, even, when, they, were, not, of, noble, lineage, in, the, male, line, while, persons, of, legitimate, male, line, descent, may, still, survive, e, g, the, modern, chiefs, of, clan, macleod, in, some, nations, hereditary, titles, as, distinct, from, noble, rank, were, not, always, recognised, in, law, e, g, poland, s, szlachta, european, ranks, of, nobility, lower, than, baron, or, its, equivalent, are, commonly, referred, to, as, the, petty, nobility, although, baronets, of, the, british, isles, are, deemed, titled, gentry, most, nations, traditionally, had, an, untitled, lower, nobility, in, addition, to, titled, nobles, an, example, is, the, landed, gentry, of, the, british, isles, unlike, england, s, gentry, the, junkers, of, germany, the, noblesse, de, robe, of, france, the, hidalgos, of, spain, and, the, nobili, of, italy, were, explicitly, acknowledged, by, the, monarchs, of, those, countries, as, members, of, the, nobility, although, untitled, in, scandinavia, the, benelux, nations, and, spain, there, are, still, untitled, as, well, as, titled, families, recognised, in, law, as, noble, in, hungary, members, of, the, nobility, always, theoretically, enjoyed, the, same, rights, in, practice, however, a, noble, family, s, financial, assets, largely, defined, its, significance, medieval, hungary, s, concept, of, nobility, originated, in, the, notion, that, nobles, were, free, men, eligible, to, own, land, this, basic, standard, explains, why, the, noble, population, was, relatively, large, although, the, economic, status, of, its, members, varied, widely, untitled, nobles, were, not, infrequently, wealthier, than, titled, families, while, considerable, differences, in, wealth, were, also, to, be, found, within, the, titled, nobility, the, custom, of, granting, titles, was, introduced, to, hungary, in, the, 16th, century, by, the, house, of, habsburg, historically, once, nobility, was, granted, if, a, nobleman, served, the, monarch, well, he, might, obtain, the, title, of, baron, and, might, later, be, elevated, to, the, rank, of, count, as, in, other, countries, of, post, medieval, central, europe, hereditary, titles, were, not, attached, to, a, particular, land, or, estate, but, to, the, noble, family, itself, so, that, all, patrilineal, descendants, shared, a, title, of, baron, or, count, cf, peerage, neither, nobility, nor, titles, could, be, transmitted, through, women, some, con, artists, sell, fake, titles, of, nobility, often, with, impressive, looking, documentation, this, may, be, illegal, depending, on, local, law, they, are, more, often, illegal, in, countries, that, actually, have, nobilities, such, as, european, monarchies, in, the, united, states, such, commerce, may, constitute, actionable, fraud, rather, than, criminal, usurpation, of, an, exclusive, right, to, use, of, any, given, title, by, an, established, class, aristocrat, and, aristocracy, in, modern, usage, refer, colloquially, and, broadly, to, persons, who, inherit, elevated, social, status,

1834, for, noble, birth, or, descent, it, is, also, known, as, a, translation, of, the, spanish, phrase, sangre, azul, which, described, the, spanish, royal, family, and, high, nobility, who, claimed, to, be, of, visigothic, descent, in, contrast, to, the, moors, the, idiom, originates, from, ancient, and, medieval, societies, of, europe, and, distinguishes, an, upper, class, whose, superficial, veins, appeared, blue, through, their, untanned, skin, from, a, working, class, of, the, time, the, latter, consisted, mainly, of, agricultural, peasants, who, spent, most, of, their, time, working, outdoors, and, thus, had, tanned, skin, through, which, superficial, veins, appear, less, prominently, robert, lacey, explains, the, genesis, of, the, blue, blood, concept, it, was, the, spaniards, who, gave, the, world, the, notion, that, an, aristocrat, s, blood, is, not, red, but, blue, the, spanish, nobility, started, taking, shape, around, the, ninth, century, in, classic, military, fashion, occupying, land, as, warriors, on, horseback, they, were, to, continue, the, process, for, more, than, five, hundred, years, clawing, back, sections, of, the, peninsula, from, its, moorish, occupiers, and, a, nobleman, demonstrated, his, pedigree, by, holding, up, his, sword, arm, to, display, the, filigree, of, blue, blooded, veins, beneath, his, pale, skin, proof, that, his, birth, had, not, been, contaminated, by, the, dark, skinned, enemy, africa, has, a, plethora, of, ancient, lineages, in, its, various, constituent, nations, some, such, as, the, numerous, sharifian, families, of, north, africa, the, keita, dynasty, of, mali, the, solomonic, dynasty, of, ethiopia, the, de, souza, family, of, benin, the, zulfikar, family, of, egypt, and, the, sherbro, tucker, clan,

africa, belong, to, peoples, that, have, been, resident, in, the, continent, for, millennia, generally, their, royal, or, noble, status, is, recognized, by, and, derived, from, the, authority, of, traditional, custom, a, number, of, them, also, enjoy, either, a, constitutional, or, a, statutory, recognition, of, their, high, social, positions, ethiopia, has, a, nobility, that, is, almost, as, old, as, the, country, itself, throughout, the, history, of, the, ethiopian, empire, most, of, the, titles, of, nobility, have, been, tribal, or, military, in, nature, however, the, ethiopian, nobility, resembled, its, european, counterparts, in, some, respects, until, 1855, when, tewodros, ii, ended, the, zemene, mesafint, its, aristocracy, was, organized, similarly, to, the, feudal, system, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, for, more, than, seven, centuries, ethiopia, or, abyssinia, as, it, was, then, known, was, made, up, of, many, small, kingdoms, principalities, emirates, and, imamates, which, owed, their, allegiance, to, the, n, gus, n, g, st, literally, king, of, kings, despite, its, being, a, christian, monarchy, various, muslim, states, paid, tribute, to, the, emperors, of, ethiopia, for, centuries, including, the, adal, sultanate, the, emirate, of, harar, and, the, awsa, sultanate, ethiopian, nobility, were, divided, into, two, different, categories, mesafint, prince, the, hereditary, nobility, that, formed, the, upper, echelon, of, the, ruling, class, and, the, mekwanin, governor, who, were, appointed, nobles, often, of, humble, birth, who, formed, the, bulk, of, the, nobility, cf, the, ministerialis, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, ethiopia, there, were, titles, of, nobility, among, the, mesafint, borne, by, those, at, the, apex, of, medieval, ethiopian, society, the, highest, royal, title, after, that, of, emperor, was, negus, king, which, was, held, by, hereditary, governors, of, the, provinces, of, begemder, shewa, gojjam, and, wollo, the, next, highest, seven, titles, were, ras, dejazmach, fit, awrari, grazmach, qenyazmach, azmach, and, balambaras, the, title, of, le, ul, ras, was, accorded, to, the, heads, of, various, noble, families, and, cadet, branches, of, the, solomonic, dynasty, such, as, the, princes, of, gojjam, tigray, and, selalle, the, heirs, of, the, le, ul, rases, were, titled, le, ul, dejazmach, indicative, of, the, higher, status, they, enjoyed, relative, to, dejazmaches, who, were, not, of, the, blood, imperial, there, were, various, hereditary, titles, in, ethiopia, including, that, of, jantirar, reserved, for, males, of, the, family, of, empress, menen, asfaw, who, ruled, over, the, mountain, fortress, of, ambassel, in, wollo, wagshum, a, title, created, for, the, descendants, of, the, deposed, zagwe, dynasty, and, shum, agame, held, by, the, descendants, of, dejazmach, sabagadis, who, ruled, over, the, agame, district, of, tigray, the, vast, majority, of, titles, borne, by, nobles, were, not, however, hereditary, despite, being, largely, dominated, by, christian, elements, some, muslims, obtained, entr, e, into, the, ethiopian, nobility, as, part, of, their, quest, for, aggrandizement, during, the, 1800s, to, do, so, they, were, generally, obliged, to, abandon, their, faith, and, some, are, believed, to, have, feigned, conversion, to, christianity, for, the, sake, of, acceptance, by, the, old, christian, aristocratic, families, one, such, family, the, wara, seh, more, commonly, called, the, yejju, dynasty, converted, to, christianity, and, eventually, wielded, power, for, over, a, century, ruling, with, the, sanction, of, the, solomonic, emperors, the, last, such, muslim, noble, to, join, the, ranks, of, ethiopian, society, was, mikael, of, wollo, who, converted, was, made, negus, of, wollo, and, later, king, of, zion, and, even, married, into, the, imperial, family, he, lived, to, see, his, son, lij, iyasu, inherit, the, throne, in, 1913, only, to, be, deposed, in, 1916, because, of, his, conversion, to, islam, the, nobility, in, madagascar, are, known, as, the, andriana, in, much, of, madagascar, before, french, colonization, of, the, island, the, malagasy, people, were, organised, into, a, rigid, social, caste, system, within, which, the, andriana, exercised, both, spiritual, and, political, leadership, the, word, andriana, has, been, used, to, denote, nobility, in, various, ethnicities, in, madagascar, including, the, merina, the, betsileo, the, betsimisaraka, the, tsimihety, the, bezanozano, the, antambahoaka, and, the, antemoro, the, word, andriana, has, often, formed, part, of, the, names, of, malagasy, kings, princes, and, nobles, linguistic, evidence, suggests, that, the, origin, of, the, title, andriana, is, traceable, back, to, an, ancient, javanese, title, of, nobility, before, the, colonization, by, france, in, the, 1890s, the, andriana, held, various, privileges, including, land, ownership, preferment, for, senior, government, posts, free, labor, from, members, of, lower, classes, the, right, to, have, their, tombs, constructed, within, town, limits, etc, the, andriana, rarely, married, outside, their, caste, a, high, ranking, woman, who, married, a, lower, ranking, man, took, on, her, husband, s, lower, rank, but, a, high, ranking, man, marrying, a, woman, of, lower, rank, did, not, forfeit, his, status, although, his, children, could, not, inherit, his, rank, or, property, cf, morganatic, marriage, in, 2011, the, council, of, kings, and, princes, of, madagascar, endorsed, the, revival, of, a,

the, membership, of, historically, prominent, families, in, the, various, subnational, kingdoms, of, the, country, membership, of, initiatory, societies, that, have, inalienable, functions, within, the, kingdoms, is, also, a, common, feature, of, nigerian, nobility, particularly, among, the, southern, tribes, where, such, figures, as, the, ogboni, of, the, yoruba, the, nze, na, ozo, of, the, igbo, and, the, ekpe, of, the, efik, are, some, of, the, most, famous, examples, although, many, of, their, traditional, functions, have, become, dormant, due, to, the, advent, of, modern, governance, their, members, retain, precedence, of, a, traditional, nature, and, are, especially, prominent, during, festivals, outside, of, this, many, of, the, traditional, nobles, of, nigeria, continue, to, serve, as, privy, counsellors, and, viceroys, in, the, service, of, their, traditional, sovereigns, in, a, symbolic, continuation, of, the, way, that, their, titled, ancestors, and, predecessors, did, during, the, pre, colonial, and, colonial, periods, many, of, them, are, also, members, of, the, country, s, political, elite, due, to, their, not, being, covered, by, the, prohibition, from,

class, of, aristocracy, associated, with, warriorhood, developing, after, the, 10th, century, in, the, indian, subcontinent, during, the, mughal, era, a, class, of, administrators, known, as, nawabs, emerged, who, initially, served, as, governors, of, provinces, later, becoming, independent, in, the, british, raj, many, members, of, the, nobility, were, elevated, to, royalty, as, they, became, the, monarchs, of, their, princely, states, but, as, many, princely, state, rulers, were, reduced, from, royals, to, noble, zamindars, hence, many, nobles, in, the, subcontinent, had, royal, titles, of, raja, rai, rana, rao, etc, in, nepal, kaji, nepali, was, a, title, and, position, used, by, nobility, of, gorkha, kingdom, 1559, 1768, and, kingdom, of, nepal, 1768, 1846, historian, mahesh, chandra, regmi, suggests, that, kaji, is, derived, from, sanskrit, word, karyi, which, meant, functionary, other, noble, and, aristocratic, titles, were, thakur, sardar, jagirdar, mankari, dewan, pradhan, kaji, etc, in, east, asia, the, system, was, often, modeled, on, imperial, china, the, leading, culture, emperors, conferred, titles, of, nobility, imperial, descendants, formed, the, highest, class, of, ancient, chinese, nobility, their, status, based, upon, the, rank, of, the, empress, or, concubine, from, which, they, descend, maternally, as, emperors, were, polygamous, numerous, titles, such, as, taizi, crown, prince, and, equivalents, of, prince, were, accorded, and, due, to, complexities, in, dynastic, rules, rules, were, introduced, for, imperial, descendants, the, titles, of, the, junior, princes, were, gradually, lowered, in, rank, by, each, generation, while, the, senior, heir, continued, to, inherit, their, father, s, titles, it, was, a, custom, in, china, for, the, new, dynasty, to, ennoble, and, enfeoff, a, member, of, the, dynasty, which, they, overthrew, with, a, title, of, nobility, and, a, fief, of, land, so, that, they, could, offer, sacrifices, to, their, ancestors, in, addition, to, members, of, other, preceding, dynasties, china, had, a, feudal, system, in, the, shang, and, zhou, dynasties, which, gradually, gave, way, to, a, more, bureaucratic, one, beginning, in, the, qin, dynasty, 221, bc, this, continued, through, the, song, dynasty, and, by, its, peak, power, shifted, from, nobility, to, bureaucrats, this, development, was, gradual, and, generally, only, completed, in, full, by, the, song, dynasty, in, the, han, dynasty, for, example, even, though, noble, titles, were, no, longer, given, to, those, other, than, the, emperor, s, relatives, the, fact, that, the, process, of, selecting, officials, was, mostly, based, on, a, vouching, system, by, current, officials, as, officials, usually, vouched, for, their, own, sons, or, those, of, other, officials, meant, that, a, de, facto, aristocracy, continued, to, exist, this, process, was, further, deepened, during, the, three, kingdoms, period, with, the, introduction, of, the, nine, rank, system, by, the, sui, dynasty, however, the, institution, of, the, imperial, examination, system, marked, the, transformation, of, a, power, shift, towards, a, full, bureaucracy, though, the, process, would, not, be, truly, completed, until, the, song, dynasty, titles, of, nobility, became, symbolic, along, with, a, stipend, while, governance, of, the, country, shifted, to, scholar, officials, in, the, qing, dynasty, titles, of, nobility, were, still, granted, by, the, emperor, but, served, merely, as, honorifics, based, on, a, loose, system, of, favours, to, the, qing, emperor, under, a, centralized, system, the, empire, s, governance, was, the, responsibility, of, the, confucian, educated, scholar, officials, and, the, local, gentry, while, the, literati, were, accorded, gentry, status, for, male, citizens, advancement, in, status, was, possible, via, garnering, the, top, three, positions, in, imperial, examinations, the, qing, appointed, the, ming, imperial, descendants, to, the, title, of, marquis, of, extended, grace, the, oldest, held, continuous, noble, title, in, chinese, history, was, that, held, by, the, descendants, of, confucius, as, duke, yansheng, which, was, renamed, as, the, sacrificial, official, to, confucius, in, 1935, by, the, republic, of, china, the, title, is, held, by, kung, tsui, chang, there, is, also, a, sacrificial, official, to, mencius, for, a, descendant, of, mencius, a, sacrificial, official, to, zengzi, for, a, descendant, of, zengzi, and, a, sacrificial, official, to, yan, hui, for, a, descendant, of, yan, hui, the, bestowal, of, titles, was, abolished, upon, the, establishment, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1949, as, part, of, a, larger, effort, to, remove, feudal, influences, and, practises, from, chinese, society, unlike, china, silla, s, bone, nobles, were, much, more, aristocratic, and, had, the, right, to, collect, taxes, and, rule, over, people, they, also, thought, of, the, king, as, buddha, and, justified, their, rule, through, the, idea, that, status, was, determined, by, birth, however, this, strict, sense, of, social, status, gradually, weakened, due, to, the, introduction, of, confucianism, and, opposition, from, the, lower, class, and, even, in, silla, opportunities, were, given, to, people, of, low, social, status, through, confucian, tests, such, as, however, the, still, strict, status, order, of, silla, caused, opposition, from, many, people, and, collapsed, when, the, country, moved, to, goryeo, in, goryeo, powerful, families, along, with, existing, nobles, became, nobles, claiming, a, new, lineage, nobility, and, in, goryeo, dissatisfied, lower, class, people, confronted, the, nobles, and, took, power, for, a, short, period, of, time, goryeo, also, had, many, hereditary, families, and, they, were, more, aristocratic, than, confucian, bureaucrats, forcibly, collecting, taxes, from, the, people, being, slaughtered, by, the, mongolian, army, killing, those, who, rebelled, and, writing, poetry, ignoring, their, situation, as, goryeo, weakened, and, nobles, pursuing, joseon, appeared, goryeo, s, nobility, could, not, stand, against, them, and, chose, to, be, absorbed, into, yangban, however, since, the, korean, nobility, had, never, experienced, defeat, by, commoners, like, han, gaozu, liu, bang, the, aristocratic, character, was, not, completely, extinguished, even, in, joseon, which, began, to, actively, introduce, han, chinese, rule, so, in, the, early, days, there, were, quite, a, few, hereditary, powerful, noblemen, like, the, jeju, ko, however, as, confucian, reforms, continued, it, became, difficult, for, yangbans, to, obtain, political, positions, if, they, did, not, pass, the, exam, each, of, them, was, usually, still, superior, to, ordinary, people, but, was, not, recognized, unless, it, passed, the, test, so, now, to, become, a, yangban, it, was, essential, for, the, members, to, pass, the, exam, in, some, islamic, countries, there, are, no, definite, noble, titles, titles, of, hereditary, rulers, being, distinct, from, those, of, hereditary, intermediaries, between, monarchs, and, commoners, persons, who, can, trace, legitimate, descent, from, muhammad, or, the, clans, of, quraysh, as, can, members, of, several, present, or, formerly, reigning, dynasties, are, widely, regarded, as, belonging, to, the, ancient, hereditary, islamic, nobility, in, some, islamic, countries, they, inherit, through, mother, or, father, hereditary, titles, although, without, any, other, associated, privilege, e, g, variations, of, the, title, sayyid, and, sharif, regarded, as, more, religious, than, the, general, population, many, people, turn, to, them, for, clarification, or, guidance, in, religious, matters, in, iran, historical, titles, of, the, nobility, including, mirza, khan, ed, dowleh, and, shahzada, son, of, a, shah, are, now, no, longer, recognised, an, aristocratic, family, is, now, recognised, by, their, family, name, often, derived, from, the, post, held, by, their, ancestors, considering, the, fact, that, family, names, in, iran, only, appeared, in, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, sultans, have, been, an, integral, part, of, islamic, history, see, zarabi, during, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, imperial, court, and, the, provinces, there, were, many, ottoman, titles, and, appellations, forming, a, somewhat, unusual, and, complex, system, in, comparison, with, the, other, islamic, countries, the, bestowal, of, noble, and, aristocratic, titles, was, widespread, across, the, empire, even, after, its, fall, by, independent, monarchs, one, of, the, most, elaborate, examples, is, that, of, the, egyptian, aristocracy, s, largest, clan, the, abaza, family, of, maternal, abazin, and, circassian, origin, medieval, japan, developed, a, feudal, system, similar, to, the, european, system, where, land, was, held, in, exchange, for, military, service, the, daimy, class, or, hereditary, landowning, nobles, held, great, socio, political, power, as, in, europe, they, commanded, private, armies, made, up, of, samurai, an, elite, warrior, class, for, long, periods, these, held, the, real, power, without, a, real, central, government, and, often, plunged, the, country, into, a, state, of, civil, war, the, daimy, class, can, be, compared, to, european, peers, and, the, samurai, to, european, knights, but, important, differences, exist, following, the, meiji, restoration, in, 1868, feudal, titles, and, ranks, were, reorgnised, into, the, kazoku, a, five, rank, peerage, system, after, the, british, example, which, granted, seats, in, the, upper, house, of, the, imperial, diet, this, ended, in, 1947, following, japan, s, defeat, in, world, war, ii, like, other, southeast, asian, countries, many, regions, in, the, philippines, have, indigenous, nobility, partially, influenced, by, hindu, chinese, and, islamic, custom, since, ancient, times, datu, was, the, common, title, of, a, chief, or, monarch, of, the, many, pre, colonial, principalities, and, sovereign, dominions, throughout, the, isles, in, some, areas, the, term, apo, was, also, used, with, the, titles, sultan, and, rajah, datu, and, its, malay, cognate, datok, are, currently, used, in, some, parts, of, the, philippines, indonesia, malaysia, and, brunei, these, titles, are, the, rough, equivalents, of, european, titles, albeit, dependent, on, the, actual, wealth, and, prestige, of, the, bearer, upon, the, islands, christianization, the, datus, retained, governance, of, their, territories, despite, annexation, to, the, spanish, empire, in, a, law, signed, 11, june, 1594, king, philip, ii, of, spain, ordered, that, the, indigenous, rulers, continue, to, receive, the, same, honors, and, privileges, accorded, them, prior, their, conversion, to, catholicism, the, baptized, nobility, subsequently, coalesced, into, the, exclusive, landed, ruling, class, of, the, lowlands, known, as, the, principal, a, on, 22, march, 1697, king, charles, ii, of, spain, confirmed, the, privileges, granted, by, his, predecessors, in, title, vii, book, vi, of, the, laws, of, the, indies, to, indigenous, nobilities, of, the, crown, colonies, including, the, principal, a, of, the, philippines, and, extended, to, them, and, to, their, descendants, the, preeminence, and, honors, customarily, attributed, to, the, hidalgos, of, castile, the, laws, of, the, indies, and, other, pertinent, royal, decrees, were, enforced, in, the, philippines, and, benefited, many, indigenous, nobles, it, can, be, seen, very, clearly, and, irrefutably, that, during, the, colonial, period, indigenous, chiefs, were, equated, with, the, spanish, hidalgos, and, the, most, resounding, proof, of, the, application, of, this, comparison, is, the, general, military, archive, in, segovia, where, the, qualifications, of, nobility, found, in, the, service, records, are, attributed, to, those, filipinos, who, were, admitted, to, the, spanish, military, academies, and, whose, ancestors, were, caciques, encomenderos, notable, tagalogs, chieftains, governors, or, those, who, held, positions, in, the, municipal, administration, or, government, in, all, different, regions, of, the, large, islands, of, the, archipelago, or, of, the, many, small, islands, of, which, it, is, composed, in, the, context, of, the, ancient, tradition, and, norms, of, castilian, nobility, all, descendants, of, a, noble, are, considered, noble, regardless, of, fortune, at, the, real, academia, de, la, historia, there, is, a, substantial, number, of, records, providing, reference, to, the, philippine, islands, and, while, most, parts, correspond, to, the, history, of, these, islands, the, academia, did, not, exclude, among, its, documents, the, presence, of, many, genealogical, records, the, archives, of, the, academia, and, its, royal, stamp, recognized, the, appointments, of, hundreds, of, natives, of, the, philippines, who, by, virtue, of, their, social, position, occupied, posts, in, the, administration, of, the, territories, and, were, classified, as, nobles, the, presence, of, these, notables, demonstrates, the, cultural, concern, of, spain, in, those, islands, to, prepare, the, natives, and, the, collaboration, of, these, in, the, government, of, the, archipelago, this, aspect, of, spanish, rule, in, the, philippines, appears, much, more, strongly, implemented, than, in, the, americas, hence, in, the, philippines, the, local, nobility, by, reason, of, charge, accorded, to, their, social, class, acquired, greater, importance, than, in, the, indies, of, the, new, world, with, the, recognition, of, the, spanish, monarchs, came, the, privilege, of, being, addressed, as, don, or, do, a, a, mark, of, esteem, and, distinction, in, europe, reserved, for, a, person, of, noble, or, royal, status, during, the, colonial, period, other, honors, and, high, regard, were, also, accorded, to, the, christianized, datus, by, the, spanish, empire, for, example, the, gobernadorcillos, elected, leader, of, the, cabezas, de, barangay, or, the, christianized, datus, and, filipino, officials, of, justice, received, the, greatest, consideration, from, the, spanish, crown, officials, the, colonial, officials, were, under, obligation, to, show, them, the, honor, corresponding, to, their, respective, duties, they, were, allowed, to, sit, in, the, houses, of, the, spanish, provincial, governors, and, in, any, other, places, they, were, not, left, to, remain, standing, it, was, not, permitted, for, spanish, parish, priests, to, treat, these, filipino, nobles, with, less, consideration, the, gobernadorcillos, exercised, the, command, of, the, towns, they, were, port, captains, in, coastal, towns, they, also, had, the, rights, and, powers, to, elect, assistants, and, several, lieutenants, and, alguaciles, proportionate, in, number, to, the, inhabitants, of, the, town, the, recognition, of, the, rights, and, privileges, accorded, to, the, filipino, principal, a, as, hijosdalgos, of, castile, seems, to, facilitate, entrance, of, filipino, nobles, into, institutions, of, under, the, spanish, crown, either, civil, or, religious, which, required, proofs, of, nobility, 235, however, to, see, such, recognition, as, an, approximation, or, comparative, estimation, of, rank, or, status, might, not, be, correct, since, in, reality, although, the, principales, were, vassals, of, the, crown, their, rights, as, sovereign, in, their, former, dominions, were, guaranteed, by, the, laws, of, the, indies, more, particularly, the, royal, decree, of, philip, ii, of, 11, june, 1594, which, charles, ii, confirmed, for, the, purpose, stated, above, to, satisfy, the, requirements, of, the, existing, laws, in, the, peninsula, it, must, be, recalled, that, ever, since, the, beginning, of, the, colonialization, the, conquistador, miguel, l, pez, de, legazpi, did, not, strip, the, ancient, sovereign, rulers, of, the, archipelago, who, vowed, allegiance, to, the, spanish, crown, of, their, legitimate, rights, many, of, them, accepted, the, catholic, religion, and, were, his, allies, from, the, very, beginning, he, only, demanded, from, these, local, rulers, vassalage, to, the, spanish, crown, replacing, the, similar, overlordship, which, previously, existed, in, a, few, cases, e, g, sultanate, of, brunei, s, overlordship, of, the, kingdom, of, maynila, other, independent, polities, that, were, not, vassals, to, other, states, e, g, confederation, of, madja, as, and, the, rajahnate, of, cebu, were, more, of, potectorates, or, suzerainties, having, had, alliances, with, the, spanish, crown, before, the, kingdom, took, total, control, of, most, parts, of, the, archipelago, european, nobility, originated, in, the, feudal, seignorial, system, that, arose, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, originally, knights, or, nobles, were, mounted, warriors, who, swore, allegiance, to, their, sovereign, and, promised, to, fight, for, him, in, exchange, for, an, allocation, of, land, usually, together, with, serfs, living, thereon, during, the, period, known, as, the, military, revolution, nobles, gradually, lost, their, role, in, raising, and, commanding, private, armies, as, many, nations, created, cohesive, national, armies, this, was, coupled, with, a, loss, of, the, socio, economic, power, of, the, nobility, owing, to, the, economic, changes, of, the, renaissance, and, the, growing, economic, importance, of, the, merchant, classes, which, increased, still, further, during, the, industrial, revolution, in, countries, where, the, nobility, was, the, dominant, class, the, bourgeoisie, gradually, grew, in, power, a, rich, city, merchant, came, to, be, more, influential, than, a, nobleman, and, the, latter, sometimes, sought, inter, marriage, with, families, of, the, former, to, maintain, their, noble, lifestyles, however, in, many, countries, at, this, time, the, nobility, retained, substantial, political, importance, and, social, influence, for, instance, the, united, kingdom, s, government, was, dominated, by, the, unusually, small, nobility, until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, thereafter, the, powers, of, the, nobility, were, progressively, reduced, by, legislation, however, until, 1999, all, hereditary, peers, were, entitled, to, sit, and, vote, in, the, house, of, lords, since, then, only, 92, of, them, have, this, entitlement, of, whom, 90, are, elected, by, the, hereditary, peers, as, a, whole, to, represent, the, peerage, the, countries, with, the, highest, proportion, of, nobles, were, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, 15, of, an, 18th, century, population, of, 800, 000, castile, probably, 10, spain, 722, 000, in, 1768, which, was, 7, 8, of, the, entire, population, and, other, countries, with, lower, percentages, such, as, russia, in, 1760, with, 500, 000, 600, 000, nobles, 2, 3, of, the, entire, population, and, pre, revolutionary, france, where, there, were, no, more, than, 300, 000, prior, to, 1789, which, was, 1, of, the, population, although, some, scholars, believe, this, figure, is, an, overestimate, in, 1718, sweden, had, between, 10, 000, and, 15, 000, nobles, which, was, 0, 5, of, the, population, in, germany, it, was, 0, 01, in, the, kingdom, of, hungary, nobles, made, up, 5, of, the, population, all, the, nobles, in, 18th, century, europe, numbered, perhaps, 3, 4, million, out, of, a, total, of, 170, 190, million, inhabitants, by, contrast, in, 1707, when, england, and, scotland, united, into, great, britain, there, were, only, 168, english, peers, and, 154, scottish, ones, though, their, immediate, families, were, recognised, as, noble, apart, from, the, hierarchy, of, noble, titles, in, england, rising, through, baron, viscount, earl, and, marquess, to, duke, many, countries, had, categories, at, the, top, or, bottom, of, the, nobility, the, gentry, relatively, small, landowners, with, perhaps, one, or, two, villages, were, mostly, noble, in, most, countries, for, example, the, polish, landed, gentry, at, the, top, poland, had, a, far, smaller, class, of, magnates, who, were, hugely, rich, and, politically, powerful, in, other, countries, the, small, groups, of, spanish, grandee, or, peer, of, france, had, great, prestige, but, little, additional, power, in, addition, to, the, nobility, of, a, variety, of, native, populations, in, what, is, now, latin, america, such, as, the, aymara, aztecs, maya, and, quechua, who, had, long, traditions, of, being, led, by, monarchs, and, nobles, peerage, traditions, dating, to, the, colonial, and, post, colonial, imperial, periods, in, the, case, of, such, countries, as, mexico, and, brazil, have, left, noble, families, in, each, of, them, that, have, ancestral, ties, to, those, nations, indigenous, and, european, families, especially, the, spanish, nobility, but, also, the, portuguese, and, french, nobility, from, the, many, historical, native, chiefs, and, rulers, of, pre, columbian, bolivia, to, the, criollo, upper, class, that, dates, to, the, era, of, colonial, bolivia, and, that, has, ancestral, ties, to, the, spanish, nobility, bolivia, has, several, groups, that, may, fit, into, the, category, of, nobility, for, example, there, is, a, ceremonial, monarchy, led, by, a, titular, ruler, who, is, known, as, the, afro, bolivian, king, the, members, of, his, dynasty, are, the, direct, descendants, of, an, old, african, tribal, monarchy, that, were, brought, to, bolivia, as, slaves, they, have, provided, leadership, to, the, afro, bolivian, community, ever, since, that, event, and, have, been, officially, recognized, by, bolivia, s, government, since, 2007, the, nobility, in, brazil, began, during, the, colonial, era, with, the, portuguese, nobility, when, brazil, became, a, united, kingdom, with, portugal, in, 1815, the, first, brazilian, titles, of, nobility, were, granted, by, the, king, of, portugal, brazil, and, the, algarves, with, the, independence, of, brazil, in, 1822, as, a, constitutional, monarchy, the, titles, of, nobility, initiated, by, the, king, of, portugal, were, continued, and, new, titles, of, nobility, were, created, by, the, emperor, of, brazil, however, according, to, the, brazilian, constitution, of, 1824, the, emperor, conferred, titles, of, nobility, which, were, personal, and, therefore, non, hereditary, unlike, the, earlier, portuguese, and, portuguese, brazilian, titles, being, inherited, exclusively, to, the, royal, titles, of, the, brazilian, imperial, family, during, the, existence, of, the, empire, of, brazil, 1, 211, noble, titles, were, acknowledged, with, the, proclamation, of, the, first, brazilian, republic, in, 1889, the, brazilian, nobility, was, discontinued, it, was, also, prohibited, under, penalty, of, accusation, of, high, treason, and, the, suspension, of, political, rights, to, accept, noble, titles, and, foreign, decorations, without, the, proper, permission, of, the, state, in, particular, the, nobles, of, greater, distinction, by, respect, and, tradition, were, allowed, to, use, their, titles, during, the, republican, regime, the, imperial, family, also, could, not, return, to, the, brazilian, soil, until, 1921, when, the, banishment, law, was, repealed, the, mexican, nobility, were, a, hereditary, nobility, of, mexico, with, specific, privileges, and, obligations, determined, in, the, various, political, systems, that, historically, ruled, over, the, mexican, territory, the, term, is, used, in, reference, to, various, groups, throughout, the, entirety, of, mexican, history, from, formerly, ruling, indigenous, families, of, the, pre, columbian, states, of, present, day, mexico, to, noble, mexican, families, of, spanish, mestizo, and, other, european, descent, which, include, conquistadors, and, their, descendants, ennobled, by, king, philip, ii, in, 1573, untitled, noble, families, of, mexico, and, holders, of, titles, of, nobility, acquired, during, the, viceroyalty, of, the, new, spain, 1521, 1821, the, first, mexican, empire, 1821, 1823, and, the, second, mexican, empire, 1862, 1867, as, well, as, bearers, of, titles, and, other, noble, prerogatives, granted, by, foreign, powers, who, have, settled, in, mexico, the, political, constitution, of, mexico, has, prohibited, the, state, from, recognizing, any, titles, of, nobility, since, 1917, the, present, united, mexican, states, does, not, issue, or, recognize, titles, of, nobility, or, any, hereditary, prerogatives, and, honors, informally, however, a, mexican, aristocracy, remains, a, part, of, mexican, culture, and, its, hierarchical, society, a, list, of, noble, titles, for, different, european, countries, can, be, found, at, royal, and, noble, ranks
