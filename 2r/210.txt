a, guild, l, d, gild, is, an, association, of, artisans, and, merchants, who, oversee, the, practice, of, their, craft, trade, in, a, particular, territory, the, earliest, types, of, guild, formed, as, organizations, of, tradespeople, belonging, to, a, professional, association, they, sometimes, depended, on, grants, of, letters, patent, from, a, monarch, or, other, ruler, to, enforce, the, flow, of, trade, to, their, self, employed, members, and, to, retain, ownership, of, tools, and, the, supply, of, materials, but, most, were, regulated, by, the, local, government, guild, members, found, guilty, of, cheating, the, public, would, be, fined, or, banned, from, the, guild, a, lasting, legacy, of, traditional, guilds, are, the, guildhalls, constructed, and, used, as, guild, meeting, places, typically, the, key, privilege, was, that, only, guild, members, were, allowed, to, sell, their, goods, or, practice, their, skill, within, the, city, there, might, be, controls, on, minimum, or, maximum, prices, hours, of, trading, numbers, of, apprentices, and, many, other, things, critics, argued, that, these, rules, reduced, free, competition, but, defenders, maintained, that, they, protected, professional, standards, an, important, result, of, the, guild, framework, was, the, emergence, of, universities, at, bologna, established, in, 1088, oxford, at, least, since, 1096, and, paris, c, 1150, they, originated, as, guilds, of, students, as, at, bologna, or, of, masters, as, at, paris, naram, sin, of, akkad, c, 2254, 2218, bc, grandson, of, sargon, of, akkad, who, had,

vessel, a, type, of, guild, was, known, in, roman, times, known, as, collegium, collegia, or, corpus, these, were, organised, groups, of, merchants, who, specialised, in, a, particular, craft, and, whose, membership, of, the, group, was, voluntary, one, such, example, is, the, corpus, naviculariorum, a, collegium, of, merchant, mariners, based, at, rome, s, la, ostia, port, the, roman, guilds, failed, to, survive, the, collapse, of, the, roman, empire, a, collegium, was, any, association, or, corporation, that, acted, as, a, legal, entity, in, 1816, an, archeological, excavation, in, minya,

existence, of, a, shipbuilders, guild, collegia, also, included, fraternities, of, priests, overseeing, sacrifices, practicing, augury, keeping, religious, texts, arranging, festivals, and, maintaining, specific, religious, cults, there, were, several, types, of, guilds, including, the, two, main, categories, of, merchant, guilds, and, craft, guilds, but, also, the, frith, guild, and, religious, guild, guilds, arose, beginning, in, the, high, middle, ages, as, craftsmen, united, to, protect, their, common, interests, in, the, german, city, of, augsburg, craft, guilds, are, mentioned, in, the, towncharter, of, 1156, the, continental, system, of, guilds, and, merchants, arrived, in, england, after, the, norman, conquest, with, incorporated, societies, of, merchants, in, each, town, or, city, holding, exclusive, rights, of, doing, business, there, in, many, cases, they, became, the, governing, body, of, a, town, for, example, london, s, guildhall, became, the, seat, of, the, court, of, common, council, of, the, city, of, london, corporation, the, world, s, oldest, continuously, elected, local, government, whose, members, to, this, day, must, be, freemen, of, the, city, the, freedom, of, the, city, effective, from, the, middle, ages, until, 1835, gave, the, right, to, trade, and, was, only, bestowed, upon, members, of, a, guild, or, livery, early, egalitarian, communities, called, guilds, were, denounced, by, catholic, clergy, for, their, conjurations, the, binding, oaths, sworn, among, the, members, to, support, one, another, in, adversity, kill, specific, enemies, and, back, one, another, in, feuds, or, in, business, ventures, the, occasion, for, these, oaths, were, drunken, banquets, held, on, december, 26, in, 858, west, francian, bishop, hincmar, sought, vainly, to, christianise, the, guilds, in, the, early, middle, ages, most, of, the, roman, craft, organisations, originally, formed, as, religious, confraternities, had, disappeared, with, the, apparent, exceptions, of, stonecutters, and, perhaps, glassmakers, mostly, the, people, that, had, local, skills, gregory, of, tours, tells, a, miraculous, tale, of, a, builder, whose, art, and, techniques, suddenly, left, him, but, were, restored, by, an, apparition, of, the, virgin, mary, in, a, dream, michel, rouche, remarks, that, the, story, speaks, for, the, importance, of, practically, transmitted, journeymanship, in, france, guilds, were, called, corps, de, m, tiers, according, to, viktor, ivanovich, rutenburg, within, the, guild, itself, there, was, very, little, division, of, labour, which, tended, to, operate, rather, between, the, guilds, thus, according, to, tienne, boileau, s, book, of, handicrafts, by, the, mid, 13th, century, there, were, no, less, than, 100, guilds, in, paris, a, figure, which, by, the, 14th, century, had, risen, to, 350, there, were, different, guilds, of, metal, workers, the, farriers, knife, makers, locksmiths, chain, forgers, nail, makers, often, formed, separate, and, distinct, corporations, the, armourers, were, divided, into, helmet, makers, escutcheon, makers, harness, makers, harness, polishers, etc, in, catalan, towns, especially, at, barcelona, guilds, or, gremis, were, a, basic, agent, in, the, society, a, shoemakers, guild, is, recorded, in, 1208, in, england, specifically, in, the, city, of, london, corporation, more, than, 110, guilds, referred, to, as, livery, companies, survive, today, with, the, oldest, 869, years, old, other, groups, such, as, the, worshipful, company, of, tax, advisers, have, been, formed, far, more, recently, membership, in, a, livery, company, is, expected, for, individuals, participating, in, the, governance, of, the, city, as, the, lord, mayor, and, the, remembrancer, the, guild, system, reached, a, mature, state, in, germany, c, 1300, and, held, on, in, german, cities, into, the, 19th, century, with, some, special, privileges, for, certain, occupations, remaining, today, in, the, 15th, century, hamburg, had, 100, guilds, cologne, 80, and, l, beck, 70, the, latest, guilds, to, develop, in, western, europe, were, the, gremios, of, spain, e, g, valencia, 1332, or, toledo, 1426, not, all, city, economies, were, controlled, by, guilds, some, cities, were, free, where, guilds, were, in, control, they, shaped, labor, production, and, trade, they, had, strong, controls, over, instructional, capital, and, the, modern, concepts, of, a, lifetime, progression, of, apprentice, to, craftsman, and, then, from, journeyman, eventually, to, widely, recognized, master, and, grandmaster, began, to, emerge, in, order, to, become, a, master, a, journeyman, would, have, to, go, on, a, three, year, voyage, called, journeyman, years, the, practice, of, the, journeyman, years, still, exists, in, germany, and, france, as, production, became, more, specialized, trade, guilds, were, divided, and, subdivided, eliciting, the, squabbles, over, jurisdiction, that, produced, the, paperwork, by, which, economic, historians, trace, their, development, the, metalworking, guilds, of, nuremberg, were, divided, among, dozens, of, independent, trades, in, the, boom, economy, of, the, 13th, century, and, there, were, 101, trades, in, paris, by, 1260, in, ghent, as, in, florence, the, woolen, textile, industry, developed, as, a, congeries, of, specialized, guilds, the, appearance, of, the, european, guilds, was, tied, to, the, emergent, money, economy, and, to, urbanization, before, this, time, it, was, not, possible, to, run, a, money, driven, organization, as, commodity, money, was, the, normal, way, of, doing, business, the, guild, was, at, the, center, of, european, handicraft, organization, into, the, 16th, century, in, france, a, resurgence, of, the, guilds, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, is, symptomatic, of, louis, xiv, and, jean, baptiste, colbert, s, administration, s, concerns, to, impose, unity, control, production, and, reap, the, benefits, of, transparent, structure, in, the, shape, of, efficient, taxation, the, guilds, were, identified, with, organizations, enjoying, certain, privileges, letters, patent, usually, issued, by, the, king, or, state, and, overseen, by, local, town, business, authorities, some, kind, of, chamber, of, commerce, these, were, the, predecessors, of, the, modern, patent, and, trademark, system, the, guilds, also, maintained, funds, in, order, to, support, infirm, or, elderly, members, as, well, as, widows, and, orphans, of, guild, members, funeral, benefits, and, a, tramping, allowance, for, those, needing, to, travel, to, find, work, as, the, guild, system, of, the, city, of, london, declined, during, the, 17th, century, the, livery, companies, transformed, into, mutual, assistance, fraternities, along, such, lines, european, guilds, imposed, long, standardized, periods, of, apprenticeship, and, made, it, difficult, for, those, lacking, the, capital, to, set, up, for, themselves, or, without, the, approval, of, their, peers, to, gain, access, to, materials, or, knowledge, or, to, sell, into, certain, markets, an, area, that, equally, dominated, the, guilds, concerns, these, are, defining, characteristics, of, mercantilism, in, economics, which, dominated, most, european, thinking, about, political, economy, until, the, rise, of, classical, economics, the, guild, system, survived, the, emergence, of, early, capitalists, which, began, to, divide, guild, members, into, haves, and, dependent, have, nots, the, civil, struggles, that, characterize, the, 14th, century, towns, and, cities, were, struggles, in, part, between, the, greater, guilds, and, the, lesser, artisanal, guilds, which, depended, on, piecework, in, florence, they, were, openly, distinguished, the, arti, maggiori, and, the, arti, minori, already, there, was, a, popolo, grasso, and, a, popolo, magro, fiercer, struggles, were, those, between, essentially, conservative, guilds, and, the, merchant, class, which, increasingly, came, to, control, the, means, of, production, and, the, capital, that, could, be, ventured, in, expansive, schemes, often, under, the, rules, of, guilds, of, their, own, german, social, historians, trace, the, zunftrevolution, the, urban, revolution, of, guildmembers, against, a, controlling, urban, patriciate, sometimes, reading, into, them, however, perceived, foretastes, of, the, class, struggles, of, the, 19th, century, in, the, countryside, where, guild, rules, did, not, operate, there, was, freedom, for, the, entrepreneur, with, capital, to, organize, cottage, industry, a, network, of, cottagers, who, spun, and, wove, in, their, own, premises, on, his, account, provided, with, their, raw, materials, perhaps, even, their, looms, by, the, capitalist, who, took, a, share, of, the, profits, such, a, dispersed, system, could, not, so, easily, be, controlled, where, there, was, a, vigorous, local, market, for, the, raw, materials, wool, was, easily, available, in, sheep, rearing, regions, whereas, silk, was, not, in, florence, italy, there, were, seven, to, twelve, greater, guilds, and, fourteen, lesser, guilds, the, most, important, of, the, greater, guilds, was, that, for, judges, and, notaries, who, handled, the, legal, business, of, all, the, other, guilds, and, often, served, as, an, arbitrator, of, disputes, other, greater, guilds, include, the, wool, silk, and, the, money, changers, guilds, they, prided, themselves, on, a, reputation, for, very, high, quality, work, which, was, rewarded, with, premium, prices, the, guilds, fined, members, who, deviated, from, standards, other, greater, guilds, included, those, of, doctors, druggists, and, furriers, among, the, lesser, guilds, were, those, for, bakers, saddle, makers, ironworkers, and, other, artisans, they, had, a, sizable, membership, but, lacked, the, political, and, social, standing, necessary, to, influence, city, affairs, the, guild, was, made, up, by, experienced, and, confirmed, experts, in, their, field, of, handicraft, they, were, called, master, craftsmen, before, a, new, employee, could, rise, to, the, level, of, mastery, he, had, to, go, through, a, schooling, period, during, which, he, was, first, called, an, apprenticeship, after, this, period, he, could, rise, to, the, level, of, journeyman, apprentices, would, typically, not, learn, more, than, the, most, basic, techniques, until, they, were, trusted, by, their, peers, to, keep, the, guild, s, or, company, s, secrets, like, journey, the, distance, that, could, be, travelled, in, a, day, the, title, journeyman, derives, from, the, french, words, for, day, jour, and, journ, e, from, which, came, the, middle, english, word, journei, journeymen, were, able, to, work, for, other, masters, unlike, apprentices, and, generally, paid, by, the, day, and, were, thus, day, labourers, after, being, employed, by, a, master, for, several, years, and, after, producing, a, qualifying, piece, of, work, the, apprentice, was, granted, the, rank, of, journeyman, and, was, given, documents, letters, or, certificates, from, his, master, and, or, the, guild, itself, which, certified, him, as, a, journeyman, and, entitled, him, to, travel, to, other, towns, and, countries, to, learn, the, art, from, other, masters, these, journeys, could, span, large, parts, of, europe, and, were, an, unofficial, way, of, communicating, new, methods, and, techniques, though, by, no, means, all, journeymen, made, such, travels, they, were, most, common, in, germany, and, italy, and, in, other, countries, journeymen, from, small, cities, would, often, visit, the, capital, after, this, journey, and, several, years, of, experience, a, journeyman, could, be, received, as, master, craftsman, though, in, some, guilds, this, step, could, be, made, straight, from, apprentice, this, would, typically, require, the, approval, of, all, masters, of, a, guild, a, donation, of, money, and, other, goods, often, omitted, for, sons, of, existing, members, and, the, production, of, a, so, called, masterpiece, which, would, illustrate, the, abilities, of, the, aspiring, master, craftsman, this, was, often, retained, by, the, guild, the, medieval, guild, was, established, by, charters, or, letters, patent, or, similar, authority, by, the, city, or, the, ruler, and, normally, held, a, monopoly, on, trade, in, its, craft, within, the, city, in, which, it, operated, handicraft, workers, were, forbidden, by, law, to, run, any, business, if, they, were, not, members, of, a, guild, and, only, masters, were, allowed, to, be, members, of, a, guild, before, these, privileges, were, legislated, these, groups, of, handicraft, workers, were, simply, called, handicraft, associations, the, town, authorities, might, be, represented, in, the, guild, meetings, and, thus, had, a, means, of, controlling, the, handicraft, activities, this, was, important, since, towns, very, often, depended, on, a, good, reputation, for, export, of, a, narrow, range, of, products, on, which, not, only, the, guild, s, but, the, town, s, reputation, depended, controls, on, the, association, of, physical, locations, to, well, known, exported, products, e, g, wine, from, the, champagne, and, bordeaux, regions, of, france, tin, glazed, earthenwares, from, certain, cities, in, holland, lace, from, chantilly, etc, helped, to, establish, a, town, s, place, in, global, commerce, this, led, to, modern, trademarks, in, many, german, and, italian, cities, the, more, powerful, guilds, often, had, considerable, political, influence, and, sometimes, attempted, to, control, the, city, authorities, in, the, 14th, century, this, led, to, numerous, bloody, uprisings, during, which, the, guilds, dissolved, town, councils, and, detained, patricians, in, an, attempt, to, increase, their, influence, in, fourteenth, century, north, east, germany, people, of, wendish, i, e, slavic, origin, were, not, allowed, to, join, some, guilds, according, to, wilhelm, raabe, down, into, the, eighteenth, century, no, german, guild, accepted, a, wend, in, the, russian, empire, from, the, reform, of, peter, the, great, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, until, 1917, these, were, corporations, of, wealthy, merchants, with, their, own, rights, they, therefore, constituted, an, order, which, was, divided, according, to, property, into, three, classes, merchant, of, the, first, guild, of, the, second, guild, and, of, the, third, guild, and, was, transmissible, hereditarily, ogilvie, 2004, argues, that, guilds, negatively, affected, quality, skills, and, innovation, through, what, economists, now, call, rent, seeking, they, imposed, deadweight, losses, on, the, economy, ogilvie, argues, they, generated, limited, positive, externalities, and, notes, that, industry, began, to, flourish, only, after, the, guilds, faded, away, guilds, persisted, over, the, centuries, because, they, redistributed, resources, to, politically, powerful, merchants, on, the, other, hand, ogilvie, agrees, guilds, created, social, capital, of, shared, norms, common, information, mutual, sanctions, and, collective, political, action, this, social, capital, benefited, guild, members, even, as, it, arguably, hurt, outsiders, the, guild, system, became, a, target, of, much, criticism, towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, critics, argued, that, they, hindered, free, trade, and, technological, innovation, technology, transfer, and, business, development, according, to, several, accounts, of, this, time, guilds, became, increasingly, involved, in, simple, territorial, struggles, against, each, other, and, against, free, practitioners, of, their, arts, two, of, the, most, outspoken, critics, of, the, guild, system, were, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, adam, smith, and, all, over, europe, a, tendency, to, oppose, government, control, over, trades, in, favour, of, laissez, faire, free, market, systems, grew, rapidly, and, made, its, way, into, the, political, and, legal, systems, many, people, who, participated, in, the, french, revolution, saw, guilds, as, a, last, remnant, of, feudalism, the, d, allarde, law, of, 2, march, 1791, suppressed, the, guilds, in, france, in, 1803, the, napoleonic, code, banned, any, coalition, of, workmen, whatsoever, smith, wrote, in, the, wealth, of, nations, book, i, chapter, x, paragraph, 72, it, is, to, prevent, this, reduction, of, price, and, consequently, of, wages, and, profit, by, restraining, that, free, competition, which, would, most, certainly, occasion, it, that, all, corporations, and, the, greater, part, of, corporation, laws, have, been, established, and, when, any, particular, class, of, artificers, or, traders, thought, proper, to, act, as, a, corporation, without, a, charter, such, adulterine, guilds, as, they, were, called, were, not, always, disfranchised, upon, that, account, but, obliged, to, fine, annually, to, the, king, for, permission, to, exercise, their, usurped, privileges, karl, marx, in, his, communist, manifesto, also, criticized, the, guild, system, for, its, rigid, gradation, of, social, rank, and, what, he, saw, as, the, relation, of, oppressor, and, oppressed, entailed, by, this, system, it, was, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, that, saw, the, beginning, of, the, low, regard, in, which, some, people, hold, the, guilds, to, this, day, in, part, due, to, their, own, inability, to, control, unruly, corporate, behavior, the, tide, of, public, opinion, turned, against, the, guilds, because, of, industrialization, and, modernization, of, the, trade, and, industry, and, the, rise, of, powerful, nation, states, that, could, directly, issue, patent, and, copyright, protections, often, revealing, the, trade, secrets, the, guilds, power, faded, after, the, french, revolution, they, gradually, fell, in, most, european, nations, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, as, the, guild, system, was, disbanded, and, replaced, by, laws, that, promoted, free, trade, as, a, consequence, of, the, decline, of, guilds, many, former, handicraft, workers, were, forced, to, seek, employment, in, the, emerging, manufacturing, industries, using, not, closely, guarded, techniques, formerly, protected, by, guilds, but, rather, the, standardized, methods, controlled, by, corporations, interest, in, the, medieval, guild, system, was, revived, during, the, late, 19th, century, among, far, right, circles, fascism, in, italy, among, other, countries, implemented, corporatism, operating, at, the, national, rather, than, city, level, to, try, to, imitate, the, corporatism, of, the, middle, ages, guilds, are, sometimes, said, to, be, the, precursors, of, modern, cartels, guilds, however, can, also, be, seen, as, a, set, of, self, employed, skilled, craftsmen, with, ownership, and, control, over, the, materials, and, tools, they, needed, to, produce, their, goods, some, argue, that, guilds, operated, more, like, cartels, than, they, were, like, trade, unions, olson, 1982, however, the, journeymen, organizations, which, were, at, the, time, illegal, may, have, been, influential, the, exclusive, privilege, of, a, guild, to, produce, certain, goods, or, provide, certain, services, was, similar, in, spirit, and, character, to, the, original, patent, systems, that, surfaced, in, england, in, 1624, these, systems, played, a, role, in, ending, the, guilds, dominance, as, trade, secret, methods, were, superseded, by, modern, firms, directly, revealing, their, techniques, and, counting, on, the, state, to, enforce, their, legal, monopoly, some, guild, traditions, still, remain, in, a, few, handicrafts, in, europe, especially, among, shoemakers, and, barbers, these, are, however, not, very, important, economically, except, as, reminders, of, the, responsibilities, of, some, trades, toward, the, public, modern, antitrust, law, could, be, said, to, derive, in, some, ways, from, the, original, statutes, by, which, the, guilds, were, abolished, in, europe, the, economic, consequences, of, guilds, have, led, to, heated, debates, among, economic, historians, on, the, one, side, scholars, say, that, since, merchant, guilds, persisted, over, long, periods, they, must, have, been, efficient, institutions, since, inefficient, institutions, die, out, others, say, they, persisted, not, because, they, benefited, the, entire, economy, but, because, they, benefited, the, owners, who, used, political, power, to, protect, them, ogilvie, 2011, says, they, regulated, trade, for, their, own, benefit, were, monopolies, distorted, markets, fixed, prices, and, restricted, entrance, into, the, guild, ogilvie, 2008, argues, that, their, long, apprenticeships, were, unnecessary, to, acquire, skills, and, their, conservatism, reduced, the, rate, of, innovation, and, made, the, society, poorer, she, says, their, main, goal, was, rent, seeking, that, is, to, shift, money, to, the, membership, at, the, expense, of, the, entire, economy, epstein, and, prak, s, book, 2008, rejects, ogilvie, s, conclusions, specifically, epstein, argues, that, guilds, were, cost, sharing, rather, than, rent, seeking, institutions, they, located, and, matched, masters, and, likely, apprentices, through, monitored, learning, whereas, the, acquisition, of, craft, skills, required, experience, based, learning, he, argues, that, this, process, necessitated, many, years, in, apprenticeship, the, extent, to, which, guilds, were, able, to, monopolize, markets, is, also, debated, guilds, were, often, heavily, concerned, with, product, quality, the, regulations, they, established, on, their, own, members, work, as, well, as, targeting, non, guild, members, for, illicit, practice, was, to, create, a, standard, of, work, that, the, consumer, could, rely, on, they, were, heavily, concerned, with, public, perception, in, october, 1712, the, lyon, wigmaker, guild, petitioned, the, local, police, magistrates, according, to, this, petition, guildmasters, required, guild, officers, to, step, up, policing, of, statutes, forbidding, the, use, of, bleached, hair, or, wild, goat, and, lamb, hair, the, real, concern, that, they, had, was, that, bleaching, hair, destroyed, the, quality, of, the, wig, making, it, too, thin, to, style, guild, officers, pointed, out, that, if, the, consumer, discovers, the, bad, quality, the, guild, would, be, blamed, and, the, consumer, would, search, elsewhere, to, purchase, goods, women, s, participation, within, medieval, guilds, was, complex, and, varied, on, one, hand, guild, membership, allowed, women, to, participate, in, the, economy, that, provided, social, privilege, and, community, on, the, other, hand, most, trade, and, craft, guilds, were, male, dominated, and, frequently, limited, women, s, rights, if, they, were, members, or, did, not, allow, membership, at, all, the, most, common, way, women, obtained, guild, membership, was, through, marriage, usually, only, the, widows, and, daughters, of, known, masters, were, allowed, in, even, if, a, woman, entered, a, guild, she, was, excluded, from, guild, offices, while, this, was, the, overarching, practice, there, were, guilds, and, professions, that, did, allow, women, s, participation, and, the, medieval, era, was, an, ever, changing, mutable, society, especially, considering, that, it, spanned, hundreds, of, years, and, many, different, cultures, there, were, multiple, accounts, of, women, s, participation, in, guilds, in, england, and, the, continent, in, a, study, of, london, silkwomen, of, the, 15th, century, by, marian, k, dale, she, notes, that, medieval, women, could, inherit, property, belong, to, guilds, manage, estates, and, run, the, family, business, if, widowed, the, livre, des, m, tiers, de, paris, book, of, trades, of, paris, was, compiled, by, tienne, boileau, the, grand, provost, of, paris, under, king, louis, ix, it, documents, that, 5, out, of, 110, parisian, guilds, were, female, monopolies, and, that, only, a, few, guilds, systematically, excluded, women, boileau, notes, that, some, professions, were, also, open, to, women, surgeons, glass, blowers, chain, mail, forgers, entertainment, guilds, also, had, a, significant, number, of, women, members, john, duke, of, berry, documents, payments, to, female, musicians, from, le, puy, lyons, and, paris, in, rouen, women, had, participated, as, full, fledged, masters, in, 7, of, the, city, s, 112, guilds, since, the, 13th, century, there, were, still, many, restrictions, medieval, parisian, guilds, did, not, offer, women, independent, control, of, their, work, women, did, have, problems, with, entering, healers, guilds, as, opposed, to, their, relative, freedom, in, trade, or, craft, guilds, their, status, in, healers, guilds, were, often, challenged, the, idea, that, medicine, should, only, be, practiced, by, men, was, supported, by, some, religious, and, secular, authorities, at, the, time, it, is, believed, that, the, inquisition, and, witch, hunts, throughout, the, ages, contributed, to, the, lack, of, women, in, medical, guilds, in, medieval, cologne, there, were, three, guilds, that, were, composed, almost, entirely, of, women, the, yarn, spinners, gold, spinners, and, silk, weavers, men, could, join, these, guilds, but, were, almost, exclusively, married, to, guildswomen, this, was, a, required, regulation, of, the, yarn, spinners, guild, the, guildswomen, of, the, gold, spinners, guild, were, often, wives, of, guildsmen, of, the, gold, smiths, this, type, of, unity, between, husband, and, wife, was, seen, in, women, s, guild, participation, through, the, medieval, and, early, modern, periods, in, order, to, avoid, unpleasant, litigation, or, legal, situations, the, trades, of, husband, and, wife, often, were, the, same, or, complementary, women, were, not, restricted, to, solely, textile, guilds, in, medieval, cologne, and, neither, did, they, have, total, freedom, in, all, textile, guilds, they, had, limited, participation, in, the, guilds, of, dyers, cotton, weavers, and, guilds, in, the, leather, industry, they, did, enjoy, full, rights, in, some, wood, working, guilds, the, guilds, of, coopers, and, turners, women, also, seemed, to, have, extensively, engaged, in, the, fish, trade, both, within, and, outside, of, the, guild, the, butcher, and, cattle, trade, guilds, also, listed, women, among, their, ranks, in, practically, all, of, these, guilds, a, widow, was, allowed, to, continue, her, husband, s, business, if, she, remarried, to, a, man, who, was, not, a, member, she, usually, lost, that, right, the, historian, alice, clark, published, a, study, in, 1919, on, women, s, participation, in, guilds, during, the, medieval, period, she, argued, that, the, guild, system, empowered, women, to, participate, in, family, businesses, this, viewpoint, among, others, of, clark, s, has, been, criticized, by, fellow, historians, and, has, sparked, debate, in, scholarly, circles, clark, s, analysis, of, the, period, is, that, things, change, during, the, early, modern, period, specifically, the, 17th, century, and, become, more, stifling, for, women, in, guilds, she, also, posits, that, domestic, life, drove, women, out, of, guild, participation, many, historians, have, done, research, into, the, dwindling, women, s, participation, in, guilds, studies, have, provided, a, contradictory, picture, recent, historical, research, is, usually, posed, in, rebuttal, to, alice, clark, s, study, on, the, economic, marginalization, of, women, in, the, 17th, c, and, has, highlighted, that, domestic, life, did, not, organize, women, s, economic, activities, the, research, has, documented, women, s, extensive, participation, in, market, relations, craft, production, and, paid, labor, in, the, early, modern, period, clare, crowston, posits, that, women, gained, more, control, of, their, own, work, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, rather, than, losing, control, female, linen, drapers, and, hemp, merchants, established, independent, guilds, in, the, late, 17th, century, and, onward, there, was, evidence, of, growing, economic, opportunities, for, women, seamstresses, in, paris, and, rouen, and, flower, sellers, in, paris, acquired, their, own, guilds, in, 1675, in, dijon, the, number, of, female, artisans, recorded, in, tax, rolls, rose, substantially, between, the, years, of, 1643, and, 1750, in, 18th, c, nantes, there, was, a, significant, growth, in, women, s, access, to, guilds, with, no, restrictions, on, their, rights, historian, merry, wiesner, attributed, a, decline, in, women, s, labor, in, south, german, cities, from, the, 16th, 18th, centuries, to, both, economic, and, cultural, factors, as, trades, became, more, specialized, women, s, domestic, responsibilities, hindered, them, from, entering, the, workforce, german, guilds, started, to, further, regulate, women, s, participation, at, this, time, limiting, the, privileges, of, wives, widows, and, daughters, it, also, forbade, masters, from, hiring, women, crowston, notes, that, the, decline, thesis, has, been, reaffirmed, in, the, german, context, by, wiesner, and, ogilvie, but, that, it, does, not, work, in, looking, at, the, matter, from, a, larger, scope, as, her, expertise, is, in, french, history, there, were, exclusively, female, guilds, that, came, out, of, the, woodwork, in, the, 17th, century, primarily, paris, rouen, and, cologne, in, 1675, parisian, seamstresses, requested, the, guild, as, their, trade, was, organized, and, profitable, enough, to, support, incorporation, some, of, the, guilds, in, cologne, had, been, made, up, almost, entirely, of, women, since, the, medieval, period, early, modern, rouen, was, an, important, center, of, guildswomen, s, activity, by, 1775, there, were, about, 700, female, masters, accounting, for, 10, of, all, guild, masters, in, the, city, a, survey, that, circulated, in, the, late, 18th, century, listed, that, the, rouen, ribbonmakers, had, 149, masters, mistresses, and, widows, indicating, its, mixed, gendered, composition, a, tax, roll, of, 1775, indicated, that, their, total, membership, was, about, 160, with, 58, men, 17, widows, 55, wives, and, 30, unmarried, women, historians, have, noted, the, essential, contributions, that, women, made, to, these, guilds, many, scholars, have, asserted, that, it, would, have, been, impossible, for, male, merchants, and, craftsmen, to, start, a, business, let, alone, run, it, without, the, help, of, their, wives, the, oldest, women, s, guild, in, paris, dealt, in, linens, including, household, linens, layettes, for, babies, and, undergarments, there, seemed, to, be, a, major, wealth, disparity, among, its, members, the, linen, workers, whose, sheds, were, at, the, center, of, les, halles, caused, the, guild, some, trouble, there, was, a, perception, that, these, workers, also, trafficked, in, sex, as, well, as, linens, which, made, the, guild, emphatic, about, its, own, morality, on, the, other, end, of, the, social, divide, the, linen, trade, was, a, respectable, occupation, for, married, and, single, women, of, high, social, standing, in, france, special, provisions, had, to, be, made, in, order, to, assure, that, woman, could, move, relatively, freely, in, the, textile, guilds, of, paris, and, rouen, they, used, a, special, legal, formula, the, privilege, of, the, marchande, publique, this, legal, device, made, certain, that, a, woman, had, the, right, to, participate, on, her, own, behalf, in, the, economy, and, thus, did, not, require, references, to, her, husband, s, resources, or, possible, involvement, if, a, woman, did, not, join, a, guild, first, she, was, required, to, obtain, her, husband, s, permission, in, order, to, receive, the, status, of, marchande, publique, if, she, did, join, a, guild, the, status, was, conferred, automatically, the, privilege, of, marchande, publique, allowed, a, woman, to, participate, in, business, as, a, legal, adult, sign, contracts, go, to, court, and, borrow, money, in, amsterdam, seamstresses, acquired, an, independent, guild, in, 1579, in, several, other, cities, of, the, netherlands, they, obtained, subordinate, positions, in, the, tailors, guilds, during, the, late, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, frenchwomen, provided, vocational, training, to, apprentices, in, apprenticeship, contracts, the, names, and, trades, of, spouses, would, both, appear, the, trades, were, usually, the, same, or, closely, related, in, earlier, research, lack, of, contracts, led, scholars, to, believe, that, women, and, girls, never, received, official, training, and, instead, learned, their, trade, at, home, this, was, debunked, with, clare, crowston, s, research, on, parish, schools, in, france, instead, of, apprenticeships, girls, could, receive, an, alternative, form, of, vocational, training, from, these, schools, students, entered, at, around, eight, for, two, years, of, education, and, were, segregated, by, gender, boys, studied, primarily, religion, reading, writing, and, mathematics, girls, learned, many, of, the, same, topics, as, well, but, a, significant, portion, was, devoted, to, learning, needlework, these, schools, were, intended, to, enrich, the, vocational, training, that, girls, learned, so, that, they, could, go, on, and, earn, a, living, according, to, crowston, the, most, important, religious, community, that, offered, such, training, were, the, filles, de, saint, agn, s, which, offered, instruction, in, four, trades, linen, work, embroidery, lace, and, tapestry, making, the, school, provided, all, of, the, tools, necessary, for, girls, to, learn, and, also, allowed, students, to, choose, which, best, suited, them, although, this, was, far, different, than, the, model, of, apprenticeship, practiced, by, guilds, the, sisters, referred, to, their, students, as, apprentices, in, july, 1706, a, group, of, women, members, of, the, parisian, wigmakers, went, to, versailles, in, order, to, petition, louis, xiv, to, remove, a, stifling, tax, that, had, been, levied, on, wigs, that, same, year, the, tax, was, removed, in, mid, july, 1706, although, historians, do, not, believe, that, the, guildswomen, were, the, sole, reason, as, to, why, when, french, seamstresses, attained, guild, privileges, in, 1675, their, corporate, privilege, extended, to, clothing, for, women, and, children, when, they, entered, guilds, seamstresses, in, paris, rouen, and, aix, en, provence, acquired, the, right, to, make, articles, of, clothing, for, women, and, children, but, not, for, men, or, boys, over, age, eight, this, division, reappeared, in, every, french, city, where, seamstresses, entered, guilds, due, to, the, political, legislative, and, social, power, of, many, guilds, during, the, medieval, and, early, modern, periods, any, economic, activity, that, encroached, on, guild, purview, was, considered, criminal, activity, the, black, market, was, used, to, get, around, regulations, set, by, the, guild, for, membership, for, the, goods, they, produced, and, to, circumvent, expensive, fees, and, taxes, that, may, be, imposed, by, governments, illegal, work, did, not, pass, unnoticed, by, authorities, at, the, time, and, are, documented, by, police, reports, and, guild, complaints, guild, officers, were, able, to, arrest, people, who, were, working, in, the, trade, without, guild, credentials, and, could, use, municipal, law, enforcement, to, aid, them, in, the, arrest, guilds, often, did, take, people, to, court, for, illegal, work, in, 18th, c, lyon, about, half, of, the, defendants, were, men, and, half, were, women, daryl, hafter, notes, that, many, of, the, female, defendants, were, practicing, trades, where, they, were, either, completely, barred, from, guild, membership, or, had, austere, restrictions, within, the, guild, as, joining, a, guild, was, expensive, this, explains, why, poorer, men, would, turn, to, illicit, craft, clandestine, artisans, were, seen, as, a, severe, encroachment, on, guild, rights, liberties, and, exclusivity, many, guilds, feared, that, this, would, affect, economic, stability, in, paris, the, barber, wigmaker, bath, provider, guild, struggled, against, illicit, wigmaking, and, styling, in, this, case, illicit, wigmaking, flourished, in, order, to, circumvent, the, expensive, wig, tax, women, and, girls, could, enter, this, guild, illicit, wigmakers, operated, throughout, the, 18th, c, and, made, continuous, contributions, to, the, industry, judith, coffin, posits, that, the, number, of, clandestine, linen, drapers, seamstresses, and, tailors, kept, pace, and, probably, outstripped, the, numbers, from, those, guilds, clandestine, workers, male, and, female, worked, in, garret, shops, and, rooms, under, guild, jurisdiction, not, all, non, guild, work, was, illegal, too, a, non, guild, artisan, could, work, directly, for, the, crown, or, in, the, free, zones, that, were, beyond, the, reach, of, the, guild, officers, clandestine, workers, in, the, needle, trade, were, often, employed, by, larger, merchant, manufacturers, guild, members, were, also, enmeshed, in, illegal, labor, either, carrying, it, out, or, hiring, those, who, did, illegal, work, nearly, everyone, was, in, violation, of, guild, statutes, masters, of, the, guild, would, often, hire, illegal, workers, to, do, specific, and, low, paying, parts, of, the, job, in, the, case, of, the, wigmakers, it, was, hair, weaving, the, most, labor, intensive, aspect, of, the, craft, hair, weavers, arranged, pinches, of, hair, side, by, side, and, interlaced, them, in, intricate, patterns, between, six, silk, threads, extended, on, two, wooden, rods, women, called, tresseuses, seemed, to, perform, a, substantial, amount, of, this, work, outside, masters, shops, despite, the, guilds, fear, of, illegal, craft, underground, business, often, helped, guilds, survive, the, creation, of, materials, was, often, illicit, or, outsourced, from, other, locales, masters, hired, non, guild, workers, to, do, high, intensive, tasks, and, paid, less, while, at, the, same, time, denigrating, their, work, in, many, cities, guild, masters, purchased, discounted, materials, and, hired, cheap, labor, to, reduce, costs, in, lyon, the, underground, silk, economy, thrived, and, was, a, significant, portion, of, the, economy, it, was, made, up, of, mostly, female, artisans, whose, work, paralleled, that, of, the, legitimate, trade, the, female, artisans, were, important, to, the, guild, as, they, were, highly, skilled, in, craft, procedures, that, the, guild, heavily, relied, upon, and, were, essential, to, production, but, they, also, worked, for, male, entrepreneurs, outside, of, the, guild, and, frequently, collaborated, with, each, other, to, set, up, their, own, businesses, in, an, effort, to, curb, this, illicit, activity, guildmasters, wrote, bylaws, forbidding, men, and, women, to, work, outside, of, the, guild, the, buttonmakers, guild, of, lyon, also, complained, about, illicit, work, and, theft, from, the, non, guild, female, workers, whom, they, hired, they, also, took, it, upon, themselves, to, teach, girls, the, buttonmaking, trade, which, was, the, real, problem, as, their, instruction, imparted, the, mystery, of, guild, secrets, to, non, guild, members, which, undermined, the, guild, in, the, mid, 17th, c, l, beck, experienced, political, conflicts, as, guilds, petitioned, the, councils, to, ban, clandestine, work, not, only, in, the, city, but, in, rural, areas, they, were, outraged, that, members, of, the, upperclass, in, l, beck, would, employ, rural, craftsmen, at, the, expense, of, the, city, guild, a, lot, of, their, anger, spurred, from, the, fact, that, they, were, part, of, the, council, who, had, sworn, to, uphold, the, guild, early, modern, lyon, continued, to, have, a, thriving, underground, economy, into, the, late, 18th, century, in, 1780, the, hatters, guild, complained, that, women, and, girls, who, sheared, skins, for, the, industry, had, established, an, underground, manufacture, 25, years, earlier, and, that, it, was, still, sustained, these, women, were, the, wives, of, hatters, or, girls, who, were, hired, day, by, day, and, who, were, not, content, to, be, so, dependent, on, the, guild, the, women, were, accused, of, theft, of, materials, buying, stolen, materials, for, cheap, and, selling, them, for, larger, amounts, what, was, most, surprising, was, the, response, from, the, government, which, had, previously, always, stood, with, guilds, even, at, the, economy, s, expense, a, royal, edict, of, 1777, formed, a, corps, of, these, female, workers, giving, them, legitimacy, professional, organizations, replicate, guild, structure, and, operation, professions, such, as, architecture, engineering, geology, and, land, surveying, require, varying, lengths, of, apprenticeships, before, one, can, gain, a, professional, certification, these, certifications, hold, great, legal, weight, most, states, make, them, a, prerequisite, to, practising, there, though, most, guilds, died, off, by, the, middle, of, the, nineteenth, century, quasi, guilds, persist, today, primarily, in, the, fields, of, law, medicine, engineering, and, academia, paralleling, or, soon, after, the, fall, of, guilds, in, britain, and, in, the, united, states, professional, associations, began, to, form, in, america, a, number, of, interested, parties, sought, to, emulate, the, model, of, apprenticeship, which, european, guilds, of, the, middle, ages, had, honed, to, achieve, their, ends, of, establishing, exclusivity, in, trades, as, well, as, the, english, concept, of, a, gentleman, which, had, come, to, be, associated, with, higher, income, and, craftsmanship, licensing, and, accreditation, practices, which, typically, result, from, the, lobbying, of, professional, associations, constitute, the, modern, equivalent, of, a, guild, privilege, albeit, in, contrast, to, guilds, of, the, middle, ages, which, held, a, letters, patent, which, explicitly, granted, them, monopolies, on, the, provision, of, services, today, s, quasi, guild, privileges, are, subtler, more, complex, and, less, directly, restrictive, to, consumers, in, their, nature, nevertheless, it, can, be, argued, quasi, guild, privileges, are, in, many, cases, designed, not, just, to, serve, some, notion, of, public, good, but, to, facilitate, the, establishing, and, maintaining, of, exclusivity, in, a, field, of, work, there, are, often, subtle, dichotomies, present, in, attempting, to, answer, the, question, of, whether, modern, licensing, and, accreditation, practices, are, intended, to, serve, the, public, good, however, it, be, defined, for, medieval, guilds, this, dichotomy, is, exemplified, by, differing, explanations, of, the, same, phenomena, of, limiting, work, hours, among, guild, members, sheilagh, ogilvie, argues, that, this, was, intended, to, mitigate, competition, among, guild, members, while, dorothy, terry, argues, this, was, to, prevent, guild, members, from, working, late, into, the, night, while, tired, and, when, lighting, is, poor, and, therefore, producing, low, quality, work, in, modern, times, while, licensing, practices, are, usually, argued, to, in, some, way, protect, members, of, the, public, e, g, by, ensuring, quality, standards, it, usually, can, also, be, argued, that, these, practices, have, been, engineered, to, limit, the, number, of, outsiders, who, gain, entrance, to, a, given, field, as, argued, by, paul, starr, and, ronald, hamowy, both, of, whose, focus, is, on, the, development, of, medicine, in, america, the, tying, of, medical, licensing, practices, to, universities, was, a, process, intended, to, do, more, than, protect, the, public, from, quackery, but, was, engineered, to, be, unnecessarily, prolonged, inefficient, and, a, costly, process, so, as, to, deter, outsiders, from, getting, into, the, field, thereby, enhancing, the, prestige, and, earning, power, of, medical, professionals, the, university, system, in, general, continues, to, serve, as, a, basis, upon, which, modern, quasi, guilds, operate, in, the, form, of, professionalism, universitas, in, the, middle, ages, meant, a, society, of, masters, who, had, the, capacity, for, self, governance, and, this, term, was, adopted, by, students, and, teachers, who, came, together, in, the, twelfth, century, to, form, scholars, guilds, though, guilds, mostly, died, off, by, the, middle, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, scholars, guild, persisted, due, to, its, peripheral, nature, to, an, industrialized, economy, in, the, words, of, elliot, krause, the, university, and, scholars, guilds, held, onto, their, power, over, membership, training, and, workplace, because, early, capitalism, was, not, interested, in, it, there, was, no, product, that, the, capitalist, wished, to, produce, the, cultural, prestige, of, knowledge, itself, helped, keep, the, scholars, guild, and, the, university, alive, while, all, other, guilds, failed, elliot, krause, the, death, of, guilds, 1996, though, in, theory, anyone, can, start, a, college, the, privilege, in, this, case, is, the, linking, of, federal, aid, to, accreditation, while, accreditation, of, a, university, is, entirely, optional, attending, an, accredited, university, is, a, prerequisite, to, receiving, federal, aid, and, this, has, a, powerful, influence, on, limiting, consumer, options, in, the, field, of, education, as, it, provides, a, mechanism, to, limit, entrepreneurial, outsiders, from, entering, the, field, of, education, george, leef, and, roxana, burris, study, the, accreditation, system, for, which, they, observe, is, highly, collegial, and, potentially, bias, in, the, fact, that, accreditation, review, is, performed, by, members, of, schools, who, will, in, turn, be, reviewed, by, many, of, the, same, people, who, they, have, reviewed, they, further, question, the, effectiveness, of, the, methods, involved, in, accreditation, although, accreditation, is, usually, justified, as, a, means, of, giving, students, and, parents, an, assurance, of, educational, quality, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, accreditors, do, not, endeavor, to, assess, the, quality, of, individual, programs, or, departments, the, accreditation, system, is, not, based, on, an, evaluation, of, the, results, of, an, institution, but, rather, upon, an, evaluation, of, its, inputs, and, processes, if, the, inputs, and, processes, look, good, acceptable, educational, quality, is, assumed, it, is, as, if, an, organization, decided, which, automobiles, would, be, allowed, to, be, sold, by, checking, to, make, sure, that, each, car, model, had, tires, doors, an, engine, and, so, forth, and, had, been, assembled, by, workers, with, proper, training, but, without, actually, driving, any, cars, george, c, leef, and, roxana, d, burris, can, college, accreditation, live, up, to, its, promise, taken, in, the, context, of, guilds, it, can, be, argued, that, the, purpose, of, accreditation, is, to, provide, a, mechanism, for, members, of, the, scholars, guild, to, protect, itself, both, by, limiting, outsiders, from, entering, the, field, and, by, enforcing, established, norms, onto, one, another, contriving, means, to, limit, the, number, of, outsiders, who, gain, an, entrance, to, a, field, exclusivity, and, to, enforce, work, norms, among, members, were, both, distinguishing, feature, of, guilds, in, the, middle, ages, in, 1998, thomas, w, malone, championed, a, modern, variant, of, the, guild, structure, for, independent, contractors, and, remote, workers, insurance, including, any, professional, legal, liability, intellectual, capital, protections, an, ethical, code, perhaps, enforced, by, peer, pressure, and, software, and, other, benefits, of, a, strong, association, of, producers, of, knowledge, benefit, from, economies, of, scale, and, may, prevent, cut, throat, competition, that, leads, to, inferior, services, undercutting, prices, as, with, historical, guilds, such, a, structure, will, resist, foreign, competition, the, open, source, software, movement, has, from, time, to, time, explored, a, guild, like, structure, to, unite, against, competition, from, microsoft, e, g, advogato, assigns, journeyer, and, master, ranks, to, those, committing, to, work, only, or, mostly, on, free, software, patents, loosely, serve, as, a, form, of, guild, privilege, in, that, they, restrict, potential, newcomers, to, a, field, of, service, the, idea, of, a, patent, being, applied, to, intangibles, e, g, intellectual, patents, has, been, called,
