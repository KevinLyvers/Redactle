the, valley, of, the, kings, also, known, as, the, valley, of, the, gates, of, the, kings, is, an, area, in, egypt, where, for, a, period, of, nearly, 500, years, from, the, eighteenth, dynasty, to, the, twentieth, dynasty, rock, cut, tombs, were, excavated, for, pharaohs, and, powerful, nobles, under, the, new, kingdom, of, ancient, egypt, it, is, a, wadi, sitting, on, the, west, bank, of, the, nile, opposite, thebes, modern, day, luxor, and, within, the, heart, of, the, theban, necropolis, there, are, two, main, sections, the, east, valley, where, the, majority, of, the, royal, tombs, are, situated, and, the, west, valley, otherwise, known, as, the, valley, of, the, monkeys, with, the, 2005, discovery, of, a, new, chamber, and, the, 2008, discovery, of, two, further, tomb, entrances, the, valley, of, the, kings, is, known, to, contain, 65, tombs, and, chambers, ranging, in, size, from, the, simple, pit, that, is, kv54, to, the, complex, tomb, that, is, kv5, which, alone, has, over, 120, chambers, for, the, sons, of, ramesses, ii, it, was, the, principal, burial, place, for, the, new, kingdom, s, major, royal, figures, as, well, as, a, number, of, privileged, nobles, the, royal, tombs, are, decorated, with, traditional, scenes, from, egyptian, mythology, and, reveal, clues, to, the, period, s, funerary, practices, and, afterlife, beliefs, almost, all, of, the, tombs, seem, to, have, been, opened, and, robbed, in, antiquity, but, they, still, give, an, idea, of, the, opulence, and, power, of, egypt, s, pharaohs, this, area, has, been, a, focus, for, egyptologists, and, archaeological, exploration, since, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, its, tombs, and, burials, continue, to, stimulate, research, and, interest, the, valley, of, the, kings, garnered, significant, attention, following, the, discovery, of, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, in, 1922, and, is, one, of, the, most, famous, archaeological, sites, in, the, world, in, 1979, it, became, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, alongside, the, rest, of, the, theban, necropolis, exploration, excavation, and, conservation, continues, in, the, area, and, a, new, tourist, centre, has, recently, been, opened, the, valley, of, the, kings, is, situated, over, 1, 000, feet, of, limestone, and, other, sedimentary, rock, which, form, the, cliffs, in, the, valley, and, the, nearby, deir, el, bahari, interspersed, with, soft, layers, of, marl, the, sedimentary, rock, was, originally, deposited, between, 35, and, 56, million, years, ago, during, a, time, when, the, mediterranean, sea, sometimes, extended, as, far, south, as, aswan, during, the, pleistocene, the, valley, was, carved, out, of, the, plateau, by, steady, rains, there, is, now, little, year, round, rain, in, this, part, of, egypt, but, there, are, occasional, flash, floods, these, floods, dump, tons, of, debris, into, the, open, tombs, the, quality, of, the, rock, in, the, valley, is, inconsistent, ranging, from, finely, grained, to, coarse, stone, the, latter, with, the, potential, to, be, structurally, unsound, the, occasional, layer, of, shale, also, caused, construction, and, in, modern, times, conservation, difficulties, as, this, rock, expands, in, the, presence, of, water, forcing, apart, the, stone, surrounding, it, it, is, thought, that, some, tombs, were, altered, in, shape, and, size, depending, on, the, types, of, rock, the, builders, encountered, builders, took, advantage, of, available, geological, features, when, constructing, the, tombs, some, tombs, were, quarried, out, of, existing, limestone, clefts, others, behind, slopes, of, scree, and, some, were, at, the, edge, of, rock, spurs, created, by, ancient, flood, channels, the, problems, of, tomb, construction, can, be, seen, with, the, tombs, of, ramesses, iii, and, his, father, setnakhte, setnakhte, started, to, excavate, kv11, but, unintentionally, broke, into, the, tomb, of, amenmesse, so, construction, was, abandoned, and, he, instead, usurped, the, tomb, of, twosret, kv14, when, looking, for, a, tomb, ramesses, iii, extended, the, partly, excavated, tomb, started, by, his, father, the, tomb, of, ramesses, ii, returned, to, an, early, style, with, a, bent, axis, probably, due, to, the, quality, of, the, rock, being, excavated, following, the, esna, shale, between, 1998, and, 2002, the, amarna, royal, tombs, project, investigated, the, valley, floor, using, ground, penetrating, radar, and, found, that, below, the, modern, surface, the, valley, s, cliffs, descend, beneath, the, scree, in, a, series, of, abrupt, natural, shelves, arranged, one, below, the, other, descending, several, metres, to, the, bedrock, in, the, valley, floor, the, area, of, the, theban, hills, is, subject, to, infrequent, violent, thunderstorms, causing, flash, floods, in, the, valley, recent, studies, have, shown, that, there, are, at, least, seven, active, flood, stream, beds, leading, down, into, the, central, area, of, the, valley, this, central, area, appears, to, have, been, flooded, at, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, with, several, tombs, buried, under, metres, of, debris, the, tombs, kv55, kv62, and, kv63, are, dug, into, the, actual, wadi, bedrock, rather, than, the, debris, showing, that, the, level, of, the, valley, was, five, meters, below, its, present, level, after, this, event, later, dynasties, levelled, the, floor, of, the, valley, making, the, floods, deposit, their, load, further, down, the, valley, and, the, buried, tombs, were, forgotten, and, only, discovered, in, the, early, 20th, century, this, was, the, area, that, was, the, subject, of, the, amarna, royal, tombs, project, ground, scanning, radar, investigation, which, showed, several, anomalies, one, of, which, was, proved, to, be, kv63, the, theban, hills, are, dominated, by, the, peak, of, al, qurn, known, to, the, ancient, egyptians, as, ta, dehent, or, the, peak, it, has, a, pyramid, shaped, appearance, and, it, is, probable, that, this, echoed, the, pyramids, of, the, old, kingdom, more, than, a, thousand, years, prior, to, the, first, royal, burials, carved, here, its, isolated, position, also, resulted, in, reduced, access, and, special, tomb, police, the, medjay, were, able, to, guard, the, necropolis, while, the, iconic, pyramid, complex, of, the, giza, plateau, have, come, to, symbolize, ancient, egypt, the, majority, of, tombs, were, cut, into, rock, most, pyramids, and, mastabas, contain, sections, which, were, cut, into, ground, level, and, there, are, full, rock, cut, tombs, in, egypt, that, date, back, to, the, old, kingdom, after, the, defeat, of, the, hyksos, and, the, reunification, of, egypt, under, ahmose, i, the, theban, rulers, began, to, construct, elaborate, tombs, that, reflected, their, newfound, power, the, tombs, of, ahmose, i, and, his, son, amenhotep, i, their, exact, location, remains, unknown, were, probably, in, the, seventeenth, dynasty, necropolis, of, dra, abu, el, naga, the, first, royal, tombs, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, were, those, of, amenhotep, i, although, this, identification, is, also, disputed, and, thutmose, i, whose, advisor, ineni, notes, in, his, tomb, that, he, advised, the, king, to, place, his, tomb, in, the, desolate, valley, the, identity, of, this, actual, tomb, is, unclear, but, it, is, probably, kv20, or, kv38, i, saw, to, the, excavation, of, the, rock, tomb, of, his, majesty, alone, no, one, seeing, no, one, hearing, the, valley, was, used, for, primary, burials, from, approximately, 1539, bc, to, 1075, bc, it, contains, at, least, 63, tombs, beginning, with, thutmose, i, or, possibly, earlier, during, the, reign, of, amenhotep, i, and, ending, with, ramesses, x, or, xi, although, non, royal, burials, continued, in, usurped, tombs, despite, its, name, the, valley, of, the, kings, also, contains, the, tombs, of, favorite, nobles, as, well, as, the, wives, and, children, of, both, nobles, and, pharaohs, therefore, only, about, twenty, of, the, tombs, actually, contain, the, remains, of, kings, the, remains, of, nobles, and, of, the, royal, family, together, with, unmarked, pits, and, embalming, caches, make, up, the, rest, around, the, time, of, ramesses, i, ca, 1301, bc, construction, commenced, in, the, separate, valley, of, the, queens, the, official, name, for, the, site, in, ancient, times, was, the, great, and, majestic, necropolis, of, the, millions, of, years, of, the, pharaoh, life, strength, health, in, the, west, of, thebes, see, below, for, the, hieroglyphic, spelling, or, ta, sekhet, ma, at, the, great, field, at, the, start, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, only, kings, were, buried, within, the, valley, in, large, tombs, when, a, non, royal, person, was, buried, it, was, in, a, small, rock, cut, chamber, close, to, the, tomb, of, their, master, amenhotep, iii, s, tomb, was, constructed, in, the, western, valley, and, while, his, son, akhenaten, moved, his, tomb, s, construction, to, amarna, it, is, thought, that, the, unfinished, wv25, may, have, originally, been, intended, for, him, with, the, return, to, religious, orthodoxy, at, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, tutankhamun, ay, and, horemheb, returned, to, the, royal, necropolis, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, dynasties, saw, an, increase, in, the, number, of, burials, both, here, and, in, the, valley, of, the, queens, with, ramesses, ii, and, later, ramesses, iii, each, constructing, a, massive, tomb, used, for, the, burial, of, their, sons, kv5, and, kv3, respectively, there, are, some, kings, that, are, not, buried, within, the, valley, or, whose, tomb, has, not, been, located, thutmose, ii, may, have, been, buried, in, dra, abu, el, naga, although, his, mummy, was, in, the, deir, el, bahari, tomb, cache, smenkhkare, s, burial, has, never, been, located, and, ramesses, viii, seems, to, have, been, buried, elsewhere, in, the, pyramid, age, the, pyramid, tomb, of, a, king, was, associated, with, a, mortuary, temple, located, close, to, the, pyramid, since, the, tombs, of, the, kings, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, were, hidden, the, kings, mortuary, temples, were, located, away, from, their, burial, sites, closer, to, the, cultivation, facing, thebes, these, mortuary, temples, became, places, visited, during, the, various, festivals, held, in, the, theban, necropolis, most, notable, is, the, beautiful, festival, of, the, valley, where, the, sacred, barques, of, amun, re, his, consort, mut, and, son, khonsu, left, the, temple, at, karnak, in, order, to, visit, the, funerary, temples, of, deceased, kings, on, the, west, bank, and, their, shrines, in, the, theban, necropolis, the, tombs, were, constructed, and, decorated, by, the, workers, of, the, village, of, deir, el, medina, located, in, a, small, wadi, between, this, valley, and, the, valley, of, the, queens, facing, thebes, the, workers, journeyed, to, the, tombs, through, various, routes, over, the, theban, hills, the, daily, lives, of, these, workers, are, quite, well, known, due, to, their, being, recorded, in, tombs, and, official, documents, amongst, the, events, documented, is, perhaps, the, first, recorded, workers, strike, detailed, in, the, turin, strike, papyrus, the, valley, has, been, a, major, focus, of, modern, egyptological, exploration, for, the, last, two, centuries, prior, to, this, time, it, was, a, site, for, tourism, in, antiquity, especially, during, roman, times, the, area, illustrates, the, changes, in, the, study, of, ancient, egypt, starting, as, antiquity, hunting, and, ending, as, scientific, excavation, of, the, whole, theban, necropolis, despite, the, exploration, and, investigation, noted, below, only, eleven, of, the, tombs, have, actually, been, completely, recorded, many, of, the, tombs, have, graffiti, written, by, those, ancient, tourists, jules, baillet, has, located, over, 2, 100, greek, and, latin, instances, of, graffiti, along, with, a, smaller, number, in, phoenician, cypriot, lycian, coptic, and, other, languages, the, majority, of, the, ancient, graffiti, is, found, in, kv9, which, contains, just, under, a, thousand, of, them, the, earliest, positively, dated, graffiti, dates, to, 278, bc, in, 1799, members, of, napoleon, s, expedition, to, egypt, especially, vivant, denon, drew, maps, and, plans, of, the, known, tombs, and, for, the, first, time, noted, the, western, valley, where, prosper, jollois, and, douard, de, villiers, du, terrage, located, the, tomb, of, amenhotep, iii, wv22, the, description, de, l, gypte, contains, two, volumes, out, of, a, total, of, 24, on, the, area, around, thebes, european, exploration, continued, in, the, area, around, thebes, during, the, nineteenth, century, early, in, the, century, the, area, was, visited, by, giovanni, belzoni, working, for, henry, salt, who, discovered, several, tombs, including, those, of, ay, in, the, west, valley, wv23, in, 1816, and, seti, i, kv17, the, following, year, at, the, end, of, his, visits, belzoni, declared, that, all, of, the, tombs, had, been, located, and, nothing, of, note, remained, to, be, found, working, at, the, same, time, was, bernardino, drovetti, the, french, consul, general, and, a, great, rival, of, belzoni, and, salt, john, gardner, wilkinson, who, lived, in, egypt, from, 1821, to, 1832, copied, many, of, the, inscriptions, and, artwork, in, the, tombs, that, were, open, at, the, time, the, decipherment, of, hieroglyphs, though, still, incomplete, during, wilkinson, s, stay, in, the, valley, enabled, him, to, assemble, a, chronology, of, new, kingdom, rulers, based, on, the, inscriptions, in, the, tombs, he, also, established, the, system, of, tomb, numbering, that, has, been, in, use, with, additions, ever, since, the, second, half, of, the, century, saw, a, more, concerted, effort, to, preserve, rather, than, simply, gather, antiquities, auguste, mariette, s, egyptian, antiquities, service, started, to, explore, the, valley, first, with, eug, ne, lef, bure, in, 1883, then, jules, baillet, and, georges, b, n, dite, in, early, 1888, and, finally, victor, loret, in, 1898, to, 1899, loret, added, a, further, 16, tombs, to, the, list, and, explored, several, tombs, that, had, already, been, discovered, during, this, time, georges, daressy, explored, kv9, when, gaston, maspero, was, reappointed, as, head, of, the, egyptian, antiquities, service, the, nature, of, the, exploration, of, the, valley, changed, again, maspero, appointed, english, archaeologist, howard, carter, as, the, chief, inspector, of, upper, egypt, and, the, young, man, discovered, several, new, tombs, and, explored, several, others, clearing, kv42, and, kv20, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, american, explorer, theodore, m, davis, held, the, excavation, permit, for, the, valley, his, team, led, mostly, by, edward, r, ayrton, discovered, several, royal, and, non, royal, tombs, including, kv43, kv46, and, kv57, in, 1907, they, discovered, the, possible, amarna, period, cache, in, kv55, after, finding, what, they, thought, was, all, that, remained, of, the, burial, of, tutankhamun, items, recovered, from, kv54, and, kv58, it, was, announced, that, the, valley, was, completely, explored, and, that, no, further, burials, were, to, be, found, davis, s, 1912, publication, the, tombs, of, harmhabi, and, touat, nkhamanou, closes, with, the, comment, i, fear, that, the, valley, of, kings, is, now, exhausted, after, davis, s, death, early, in, 1915, lord, carnarvon, acquired, the, concession, to, excavate, the, valley, and, he, employed, howard, carter, to, explore, it, after, a, systematic, search, they, discovered, the, actual, tomb, of, tutankhamun, kv62, in, november, 1922, various, expeditions, have, continued, to, explore, the, valley, adding, greatly, to, the, knowledge, of, the, area, in, 2001, the, theban, mapping, project, designed, new, signs, for, the, tombs, providing, information, and, plans, of, the, open, tombs, a, map, of, the, valley, of, the, kings, with, locations, of, tombs, marked, the, earliest, tombs, were, located, in, cliffs, at, the, top, of, scree, slopes, under, storm, fed, waterfalls, kv34, and, kv43, as, these, locations, were, filled, burials, descended, to, the, valley, floor, gradually, moving, back, up, the, slopes, as, the, valley, bottom, filled, with, debris, this, explains, the, location, of, the, tombs, kv62, and, kv63, buried, in, the, valley, floor, the, usual, tomb, plan, consisted, of, a, long, inclined, rock, cut, corridor, descending, through, one, or, more, halls, possibly, mirroring, the, descending, path, of, the, sun, god, into, the, underworld, to, the, burial, chamber, in, the, earlier, tombs, the, corridors, turn, 90, degrees, at, least, once, such, as, kv43, the, tomb, of, thutmose, iv, and, the, earliest, ones, had, cartouche, shaped, burial, chambers, for, example, kv43, the, tomb, of, thutmose, iv, this, layout, is, known, as, bent, axis, after, the, burial, the, upper, corridors, were, meant, to, be, filled, with, rubble, and, the, entrance, to, the, tomb, hidden, after, the, amarna, period, the, layout, gradually, straightened, with, an, intermediate, jogged, axis, the, tomb, of, horemheb, kv57, is, typical, of, this, layout, and, is, one, of, the, tombs, that, is, sometimes, open, to, the, public, to, the, generally, straight, axis, of, the, late, nineteenth, and, twentieth, dynasty, tombs, ramesses, iii, s, and, ramesses, ix, s, tombs, kv11, and, kv6, respectively, as, the, tombs, axes, straightened, the, slopes, also, lessened, they, almost, disappeared, in, the, late, twentieth, dynasty, another, feature, that, is, common, to, most, tombs, is, the, well, which, may, have, originated, as, an, actual, barrier, intended, to, stop, flood, waters, from, entering, the, lower, parts, of, the, tomb, it, seems, to, have, developed, a, magical, purpose, later, as, a, symbolic, shaft, in, the, later, twentieth, dynasty, the, well, itself, was, sometimes, not, excavated, by, the, builders, but, the, well, room, was, still, present, the, majority, of, the, royal, tombs, were, decorated, with, religious, texts, and, images, the, early, tombs, were, decorated, with, scenes, from, amduat, that, which, is, in, the, underworld, which, describes, the, journey, of, the, sun, god, through, the, twelve, hours, of, the, night, from, the, time, of, horemheb, tombs, were, decorated, with, the, book, of, gates, which, shows, the, sun, god, passing, through, the, twelve, gates, that, divide, the, nighttime, and, ensures, the, tomb, owner, s, own, safe, passage, through, the, night, these, earliest, tombs, were, generally, sparsely, decorated, and, those, of, a, non, royal, nature, were, totally, undecorated, late, in, the, nineteenth, dynasty, the, book, of, caverns, which, divided, the, underworld, into, massive, caverns, containing, deities, as, well, as, the, deceased, waiting, for, the, sun, to, pass, through, and, restore, them, to, life, was, placed, in, the, upper, parts, of, tombs, a, complete, version, appears, in, the, tomb, of, ramesses, vi, the, burial, of, ramesses, iii, saw, the, book, of, the, earth, where, the, underworld, is, divided, into, four, sections, climaxing, in, the, sun, disc, being, pulled, from, the, earth, by, naunet, the, ceilings, of, the, burial, chambers, were, decorated, from, the, burial, of, seti, i, onwards, with, what, became, formalised, as, the, book, of, the, heavens, which, again, describes, the, sun, s, journey, through, the, twelve, hours, of, night, again, from, seti, i, s, time, the, litany, of, re, a, lengthy, hymn, to, the, sun, god, began, to, appear, each, burial, was, provided, with, equipment, that, would, enable, a, comfortable, existence, in, the, afterlife, also, present, in, the, tombs, were, items, used, to, perform, magic, rituals, such, as, shabtis, and, divine, figurines, some, of, the, items, may, have, been, used, by, the, king, during, his, lifetime, tutankhamun, s, sandals, for, example, and, some, were, specially, constructed, for, the, burial, the, modern, abbreviation, kv, stands, for, kings, valley, in, 1827, wilkinson, painted, kv, numbers, over, the, entrances, to, the, 21, tombs, that, lay, open, in, the, east, valley, at, that, time, beginning, at, the, valley, entrance, and, moving, southward, and, labeled, four, tombs, in, the, west, valley, as, wv1, through, wv4, the, tombs, in, the, west, valley, were, later, incorporated, into, the, east, valley, numbering, system, as, wv22, through, wv25, and, tombs, that, have, been, opened, since, wilkinson, s, time, have, been, added, to, the, list, the, numbers, range, from, kv1, rameses, vii, to, kv64, discovered, in, 2011, since, the, early, 19th, century, ad, antiquarians, and, archaeologists, have, cleared, and, recorded, tombs, with, a, total, of, 61, sepulchers, being, known, by, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, kv5, was, only, rediscovered, in, the, 1990s, after, being, dismissed, as, unimportant, by, previous, investigators, some, of, the, tombs, are, unoccupied, others, remain, unidentifiable, as, regards, to, their, owners, and, still, others, are, merely, pits, used, for, storage, most, of, the, open, tombs, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, are, located, in, the, east, valley, and, this, is, where, most, of, the, tourist, facilities, are, located, the, eighteenth, dynasty, tombs, within, the, valley, vary, quite, a, bit, in, decoration, style, and, location, it, seems, that, at, first, there, was, no, fixed, plan, the, tomb, of, hatshepsut, has, a, unique, shape, twisting, and, turning, down, over, 200, metres, from, the, entrance, so, that, the, burial, chamber, is, 97, metres, below, the, surface, the, tombs, gradually, became, more, regular, and, formalised, and, those, of, thutmose, iii, and, thutmose, iv, kv34, and, kv43, are, good, examples, of, eighteenth, dynasty, tombs, both, with, their, bent, axis, and, simple, decoration, perhaps, the, most, imposing, tomb, of, this, period, is, that, of, amenhotep, iii, wv22, located, in, the, west, valley, it, was, re, investigated, in, the, 1990s, by, a, team, from, waseda, university, japan, but, it, is, not, open, to, the, public, at, the, same, time, powerful, and, influential, nobles, began, to, be, buried, with, the, royal, family, the, most, famous, of, these, tombs, is, the, joint, tomb, of, yuya, and, tjuyu, kv46, they, were, possibly, the, parents, of, queen, tiy, until, the, discovery, of, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, this, was, the, best, preserved, of, the, tombs, that, had, been, discovered, in, the, valley, the, return, of, royal, burials, to, thebes, after, the, end, of, the, amarna, period, marks, a, change, to, the, layout, of, royal, burials, with, the, intermediate, jogged, axis, gradually, giving, way, to, the, straight, axis, of, later, dynasties, in, the, western, valley, there, is, a, tomb, commencement, that, is, thought, to, have, been, started, for, akhenaten, but, it, is, no, more, than, a, gateway, and, a, series, of, steps, the, tomb, of, ay, tutankhamun, s, successor, is, close, by, it, is, likely, that, this, tomb, was, started, for, tutankhamun, its, decoration, is, of, a, similar, style, but, later, usurped, for, ay, s, burial, this, would, mean, that, kv62, may, have, been, ay, s, original, tomb, which, would, explain, the, smaller, size, and, unusual, layout, for, a, royal, tomb, the, other, amarna, period, tombs, are, located, in, a, smaller, central, area, in, the, centre, of, the, east, valley, with, a, possible, mummy, cache, kv55, that, may, contain, the, burials, of, several, amarna, period, royals, tiy, and, smenkhkare, or, akhenaten, in, close, proximity, is, the, burial, of, tutankhamun, perhaps, the, most, famous, discovery, of, modern, western, archaeology, it, was, discovered, by, howard, carter, on, 4, november, 1922, with, clearance, and, conservation, work, continuing, until, 1932, this, was, the, first, royal, tomb, to, be, discovered, that, was, still, largely, intact, although, tomb, robbers, had, entered, until, the, excavation, of, kv63, on, 10, march, 2005, it, was, considered, the, last, major, discovery, in, the, valley, the, opulence, of, his, grave, goods, notwithstanding, tutankhamun, was, a, relatively, minor, king, and, other, burials, probably, had, more, numerous, treasures, in, the, same, central, area, as, kv62, and, kv63, is, kv64, a, radar, anomaly, believed, to, be, a, tomb, or, chamber, announced, on, 28, july, 2006, it, was, not, an, official, designation, and, the, actual, existence, of, a, tomb, at, all, was, dismissed, by, the, supreme, council, of, antiquities, prior, to, finally, excavating, and, describing, it, during, 2011, 2012, the, nearby, tomb, of, horemheb, kv57, is, rarely, open, to, visitors, but, it, has, many, unique, features, and, is, extensively, decorated, the, decoration, shows, a, transition, from, the, pre, amarna, tombs, to, those, of, the, 19th, dynasty, tombs, that, followed, the, nineteenth, dynasty, saw, a, further, standardisation, of, tomb, layout, and, decoration, the, tomb, of, the, first, king, of, the, dynasty, ramesses, i, was, hurriedly, finished, due, to, the, early, death, of, the, king, and, is, little, more, than, a, truncated, descending, corridor, and, a, burial, chamber, however, kv16, has, vibrant, decoration, and, still, contains, the, sarcophagus, of, the, king, its, central, location, makes, it, one, of, the, more, frequently, visited, tombs, it, shows, the, development, of, the, tomb, entrance, and, passage, and, of, decoration, his, son, and, successor, seti, i, s, tomb, kv17, also, known, as, belzoni, s, tomb, the, tomb, of, apis, or, the, tomb, of, psammis, son, of, necho, is, usually, regarded, as, the, finest, tomb, in, the, valley, it, has, extensive, relief, work, and, paintings, when, it, was, rediscovered, by, belzoni, in, 1817, he, referred, to, it, as, a, fortunate, day, the, son, of, seti, ramesses, ii, ramesses, the, great, constructed, a, massive, tomb, kv7, but, it, is, in, a, ruinous, state, it, is, currently, undergoing, excavation, and, conservation, by, a, franco, egyptian, team, led, by, christian, leblanc, the, tomb, is, vast, in, size, about, the, same, length, and, a, larger, area, of, the, tomb, of, his, father, at, the, same, time, and, just, opposite, his, own, tomb, ramesses, enlarged, the, earlier, small, tomb, of, an, unknown, eighteenth, dynasty, noble, kv5, for, his, numerous, sons, with, 120, known, rooms, and, excavation, work, still, underway, it, is, probably, the, largest, tomb, in, the, valley, originally, opened, and, robbed, in, antiquity, it, is, a, low, lying, structure, that, has, been, particularly, prone, to, the, flash, floods, that, sometimes, hit, the, area, tonnes, of, debris, and, material, has, washed, in, over, the, centuries, ultimately, concealing, its, vast, size, it, is, not, currently, open, to, the, public, ramesses, ii, s, son, and, eventual, successor, merenptah, s, tomb, has, been, open, since, antiquity, it, extends, 160, metres, ending, in, a, burial, chamber, that, once, contained, a, set, of, four, nested, sarcophagi, well, decorated, it, is, typically, open, to, the, public, most, years, the, last, kings, of, the, dynasty, also, constructed, tombs, in, the, valley, all, of, which, follow, the, same, general, pattern, of, layout, and, decoration, notable, amongst, these, is, the, tomb, of, siptah, which, is, well, decorated, especially, the, ceiling, the, first, ruler, of, the, dynasty, setnakhte, had, two, tombs, constructed, for, himself, he, started, excavating, the, eventual, tomb, of, his, son, ramesses, iii, but, abandoned, that, dig, when, it, unintentionally, broke, into, another, tomb, he, then, usurped, and, completed, the, tomb, of, the, nineteenth, dynasty, female, pharaoh, twosret, kv14, therefore, this, tomb, has, two, burial, chambers, the, later, extensions, making, this, one, of, the, largest, of, the, royal, tombs, at, over, 150, metres, kv11, was, later, restarted, and, extended, and, on, a, different, axis, for, ramesses, iii, the, tomb, of, ramesses, iii, kv11, known, as, bruce, s, tomb, or, the, harper, s, tomb, due, to, its, decoration, is, one, of, the, largest, tombs, in, the, valley, and, is, open, to, the, public, it, is, located, close, to, the, central, rest, area, and, its, location, and, superb, decoration, make, this, one, of, the, tombs, most, visited, by, tourists, the, successors, and, offspring, of, ramesses, iii, constructed, tombs, that, had, straight, axes, they, all, had, similar, decorations, notable, amongst, these, is, kv2, the, tomb, of, ramesses, iv, which, has, been, open, since, antiquity, containing, a, large, amount, of, hieratic, graffiti, the, tomb, is, mostly, intact, and, is, decorated, with, scenes, from, several, religious, texts, the, joint, tomb, of, ramesses, v, and, ramesses, vi, kv9, also, known, as, the, tomb, of, memnon, or, la, tombe, de, la, m, tempsychose, is, decorated, with, many, sunk, relief, carvings, depicting, illustrated, scenes, from, religious, texts, open, since, antiquity, it, contains, over, a, thousand, examples, of, graffiti, written, in, ancient, greek, latin, and, coptic, the, spoil, from, the, excavation, and, later, clearance, of, this, tomb, together, with, later, construction, of, workers, huts, covered, the, earlier, burial, of, kv62, and, seems, to, have, been, what, protected, that, tomb, from, earlier, discovery, and, looting, the, tomb, of, ramesses, ix, kv6, has, been, open, since, antiquity, as, can, be, seen, by, the, graffiti, left, on, its, walls, by, roman, and, coptic, visitors, located, in, the, central, part, of, the, valley, it, is, between, and, slightly, above, kv5, and, kv55, the, tomb, extends, a, total, distance, of, 105, metres, into, the, hillside, including, extensive, side, chambers, that, were, neither, decorated, nor, finished, the, hasty, and, incomplete, nature, of, the, rock, cutting, and, decorations, it, is, only, decorated, for, a, little, over, half, its, length, within, the, tomb, indicate, that, the, tomb, was, not, completed, by, the, time, of, ramesses, death, with, the, completed, hall, of, pillars, serving, as, the, burial, chamber, another, notable, tomb, from, this, dynasty, is, kv19, the, tomb, of, mentuherkhepshef, son, of, ramesses, ix, this, small, tomb, is, simply, a, converted, unfinished, corridor, but, the, decoration, is, extensive, the, tomb, has, been, newly, restored, and, opened, for, visitors, by, the, end, of, the, new, kingdom, egypt, had, entered, a, long, period, of, political, and, economic, decline, the, priests, at, thebes, grew, more, powerful, and, they, effectively, administered, upper, egypt, while, kings, ruling, from, tanis, controlled, lower, egypt, some, attempt, at, using, the, open, tombs, was, made, at, the, start, of, the, twenty, first, dynasty, with, the, high, priest, of, amun, pinedjem, i, adding, his, cartouche, to, kv4, the, valley, began, to, be, heavily, plundered, so, during, the, twenty, first, dynasty, the, priests, of, amun, opened, most, of, the, tombs, and, moved, the, mummies, into, three, tombs, in, order, to, better, protect, them, most, of, the, treasure, was, removed, from, the, tombs, most, of, these, were, later, moved, to, a, single, cache, near, deir, el, bahari, known, as, tt320, located, in, the, cliffs, overlooking, the, mortuary, temple, of, hatshepsut, this, mass, reburial, contained, a, large, number, of, royal, mummies, they, were, found, in, a, great, state, of, disorder, many, placed, in, other, s, coffins, and, several, are, still, unidentified, other, mummies, were, moved, to, the, tomb, of, amenhotep, ii, where, over, a, dozen, mummies, many, of, them, royal, were, later, relocated, during, the, later, third, intermediate, period, and, later, periods, intrusive, burials, were, introduced, into, many, of, the, open, tombs, in, coptic, times, some, of, the, tombs, were, used, as, churches, stables, and, even, houses, the, majority, of, the, 65, numbered, tombs, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, can, be, considered, as, minor, tombs, either, because, at, present, they, have, yielded, little, information, or, because, the, results, of, their, investigations, were, only, poorly, recorded, by, their, explorers, some, have, received, very, little, attention, or, were, only, cursorily, noted, most, of, these, tombs, are, small, often, consisting, of, only, a, single, burial, chamber, accessed, by, a, shaft, or, staircase, with, a, corridor, or, a, series, of, corridors, leading, to, the, chamber, nonetheless, some, are, larger, multiple, chambered, tombs, these, minor, tombs, served, various, purposes, some, were, intended, for, burials, of, lesser, royalty, or, private, burials, some, contained, animal, burials, and, others, apparently, never, received, a, primary, burial, in, many, cases, these, tombs, also, served, secondary, functions, and, later, intrusive, material, has, been, found, related, to, these, secondary, activities, while, some, of, these, tombs, have, been, open, since, antiquity, the, majority, were, discovered, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, during, the, height, of, exploration, in, the, valley, almost, all, tombs, throughout, egypt, have, been, robbed, several, papyri, have, been, found, that, describe, the, trials, of, tomb, robbers, these, date, mostly, from, the, late, twentieth, dynasty, one, of, these, papyrus, mayer, b, describes, the, robbery, of, the, tomb, of, ramesses, vi, and, was, probably, written, during, year, eight, or, nine, of, ramesses, x, around, 1118, bc, the, foreigner, nesamun, took, us, up, and, showed, us, the, tomb, of, king, ramesses, vi, and, i, spent, four, days, breaking, into, it, we, being, present, all, five, we, opened, the, tomb, and, entered, it, we, found, a, cauldron, of, bronze, three, wash, bowls, of, bronze, confessing, to, their, crimes, the, thief, goes, on, to, add, that, a, small, quarrel, arose, amongst, the, robbers, when, it, came, to, equally, dividing, the, spoils, collected, from, the, tomb, tombs, were, filled, with, valuables, therefore, a, prime, motivation, to, rob, them, thieves, often, looted, the, chambers, and, bodies, of, mummies, and, took, with, them, precious, metals, and, stones, the, most, common, gold, and, silver, linens, and, ointments, or, unguents, often, tombs, were, robbed, when, they, were, still, fresh, because, many, of, the, valuables, buried, with, the, mummies, were, perishable, the, valley, also, seems, to, have, suffered, an, official, plundering, during, the, virtual, civil, war, which, started, during, the, reign, of, ramesses, xi, the, tombs, were, opened, all, the, valuables, were, removed, and, the, mummies, were, collected, into, two, large, caches, one, in, the, tomb, of, amenhotep, ii, contained, sixteen, mummies, and, others, were, hidden, within, amenhotep, i, s, tomb, a, few, years, later, most, of, them, were, moved, to, the, deir, el, bahari, cache, containing, no, fewer, than, forty, royal, mummies, and, their, coffins, only, tombs, whose, locations, were, lost, kv62, kv63, and, kv46, although, both, kv62, and, kv46, were, robbed, soon, after, their, actual, closure, were, undisturbed, during, this, period, tombs, were, ransacked, for, their, valuables, but, also, for, their, original, primary, purpose, once, robbed, an, empty, tomb, could, be, used, as, a, burial, place, for, another, mummy, which, is, exactly, what, happened, in, the, smallest, of, the, pyramids, of, giza, most, of, the, tombs, are, not, open, to, the, public, 18, of, the, tombs, can, be, opened, but, they, are, rarely, open, at, the, same, time, and, officials, occasionally, close, those, that, are, open, for, restoration, work, the, number, of, visitors, to, kv62, has, led, to, a, separate, charge, for, entry, into, the, tomb, the, west, valley, has, only, one, open, tomb, that, of, ay, and, a, separate, ticket, is, needed, to, visit, this, tomb, the, tour, guides, are, no, longer, allowed, to, lecture, inside, the, tombs, and, visitors, are, expected, to, proceed, quietly, and, in, single, file, through, the, tombs, this, is, to, minimize, time, in, the, tombs, and, prevent, the, crowds, from, damaging, the, surfaces, of, the, decoration, in, 1997, 58, tourists, and, four, egyptians, were, massacred, at, nearby, deir, el, bahari, by, islamist, militants, from, al, gama, a, al, islamiyya, this, led, to, an, overall, drop, in, tourism, in, the, area, on, most, days, of, the, week, an, average, of, 4, 000, to, 5, 000, tourists, visit, the, main, valley, the, west, valley, is, much, less, visited, as, there, is, only, one, tomb, that, is, open, to, the, public
