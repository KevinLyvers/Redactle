democratization, of, government, russian, empire, supported, by, revolutionaries, supported, by, the, russian, revolution, of, 1905, also, known, as, the, first, russian, revolution, began, on, 22, january, 1905, a, wave, of, mass, political, and, social, unrest, then, began, to, spread, across, the, vast, areas, of, the, russian, empire, the, unrest, was, directed, primarily, against, the, tsar, the, nobility, and, the, ruling, class, it, included, worker, strikes, peasant, unrest, and, military, mutinies, in, response, to, the, public, pressure, tsar, nicholas, ii, was, forced, to, go, back, on, his, earlier, authoritarian, stance, and, enact, some, reform, issued, in, the, october, manifesto, this, took, the, form, of, establishing, the, state, duma, the, multi, party, system, and, the, russian, constitution, of, 1906, despite, popular, participation, in, the, duma, the, parliament, was, unable, to, issue, laws, of, its, own, and, frequently, came, into, conflict, with, nicholas, the, duma, s, power, was, limited, and, nicholas, continued, to, hold, the, ruling, authority, furthermore, he, could, dissolve, the, duma, which, he, did, three, times, in, order, to, get, rid, of, the, opposition, the, 1905, revolution, was, set, off, by, the, international, humiliation, that, resulted, from, the, russian, defeat, in, the, russo, japanese, war, which, ended, in, the, same, year, calls, for, revolution, were, intensified, by, the, growing, realisation, by, a, variety, of, sectors, of, society, of, the, need, for, reform, politicians, such, as, sergei, witte, had, succeeded, in, partially, industrializing, russia, but, failed, to, adequately, meet, the, needs, of, the, population, tsar, nicholas, ii, and, the, monarchy, narrowly, survived, the, revolution, of, 1905, but, its, events, foreshadowed, what, was, to, come, in, the, 1917, russian, revolution, many, historians, contend, that, the, 1905, revolution, set, the, stage, for, the, 1917, russian, revolutions, which, saw, the, monarchy, abolished, and, the, tsar, executed, calls, for, radicalism, were, present, in, the, 1905, revolution, but, many, of, the, revolutionaries, who, were, in, a, position, to, lead, were, either, in, exile, or, in, prison, while, it, took, place, the, events, in, 1905, demonstrated, the, precarious, position, in, which, the, tsar, found, himself, as, a, result, tsarist, russia, did, not, undergo, sufficient, reform, which, had, a, direct, impact, on, the, radical, politics, brewing, in, the, russian, empire, although, the, radicals, were, still, in, the, minority, of, the, populace, their, momentum, was, growing, vladimir, lenin, a, revolutionary, himself, would, later, say, that, the, revolution, of, 1905, was, the, great, dress, rehearsal, without, which, the, victory, of, the, october, revolution, in, 1917, would, have, been, impossible, many, factors, contributed, to, unrest, across, the, russian, empire, of, 1905, newly, emancipated, peasants, earned, too, little, and, were, not, allowed, to, sell, or, mortgage, their, allotted, land, ethnic, and, national, minorities, resented, the, policy, of, russification, of, the, empire, this, represented, discrimination, and, repression, against, national, minorities, such, as, banning, them, from, voting, serving, in, the, imperial, guard, or, navy, and, limiting, their, attendance, in, schools, a, nascent, industrial, working, class, resented, the, government, for, doing, too, little, to, protect, them, as, it, banned, strikes, and, organizing, into, labor, unions, university, students, developed, a, new, consciousness, after, discipline, was, relaxed, in, the, institutions, and, as, increasingly, radical, ideas, gained, attention, significantly, this, was, a, period, of, disaffection, in, the, russian, military, soldiers, returning, from, a, bloody, and, disgraceful, defeat, with, japan, found, inadequate, factory, pay, shortages, and, general, disarray, and, organized, in, protest, because, the, russian, economy, was, tied, to, european, finances, the, contraction, of, western, money, markets, in, 1899, 1900, plunged, russian, industry, into, a, deep, and, prolonged, crisis, it, outlasted, the, dip, in, european, industrial, production, this, setback, aggravated, social, unrest, during, the, five, years, preceding, the, revolution, of, 1905, the, tsarist, government, did, recognise, some, of, these, problems, albeit, shortsightedly, the, minister, of, the, interior, vyacheslav, von, plehve, had, said, in, 1903, that, after, the, agrarian, problem, the, most, serious, issues, plaguing, the, country, were, those, of, the, jews, the, schools, and, the, workers, in, that, order, any, residual, popular, loyalty, to, tsar, nicholas, ii, was, lost, on, 22, january, 1905, when, his, soldiers, fired, upon, a, crowd, of, protesting, workers, led, by, georgy, gapon, who, were, marching, to, present, a, petition, at, the, winter, palace, every, year, thousands, of, nobles, in, debt, mortgaged, their, estates, to, the, noble, land, bank, or, sold, them, to, municipalities, merchants, or, peasants, by, the, time, of, the, revolution, the, nobility, had, sold, off, one, third, of, its, land, and, mortgaged, another, third, the, peasants, had, been, freed, by, the, emancipation, reform, of, 1861, but, their, lives, were, generally, quite, limited, the, government, hoped, to, develop, the, peasants, as, a, politically, conservative, land, holding, class, by, enacting, laws, to, enable, them, to, buy, land, from, nobility, by, paying, small, installments, over, many, decades, such, land, known, as, allotment, land, would, not, be, owned, by, individual, peasants, but, by, the, community, of, peasants, individual, peasants, would, have, rights, to, strips, of, land, to, be, assigned, to, them, under, the, open, field, system, a, peasant, could, not, sell, or, mortgage, this, land, so, in, practice, he, could, not, renounce, his, rights, to, his, land, and, he, would, be, required, to, pay, his, share, of, redemption, dues, to, the, village, commune, this, plan, was, intended, to, prevent, peasants, from, becoming, part, of, the, proletariat, however, the, peasants, were, not, given, enough, land, to, provide, for, their, needs, their, earnings, were, often, so, small, that, they, could, neither, buy, the, food, they, needed, nor, keep, up, the, payment, of, taxes, and, redemption, dues, they, owed, the, government, for, their, land, allotments, by, 1903, their, total, arrears, in, payments, of, taxes, and, dues, was, 118, million, rubles, the, situation, worsened, as, masses, of, hungry, peasants, roamed, the, countryside, looking, for, work, and, sometimes, walked, hundreds, of, kilometers, to, find, it, desperate, peasants, proved, capable, of, violence, in, the, provinces, of, kharkov, and, poltava, in, 1902, thousands, of, them, ignoring, restraints, and, authority, burst, out, in, a, rebellious, fury, that, led, to, extensive, destruction, of, property, and, looting, of, noble, homes, before, troops, could, be, brought, to, subdue, and, punish, them, these, violent, outbreaks, caught, the, attention, of, the, government, so, it, created, many, committees, to, investigate, the, causes, the, committees, concluded, that, no, part, of, the, countryside, was, prosperous, some, parts, especially, the, fertile, areas, known, as, the, black, soil, region, were, in, decline, although, cultivated, acreage, had, increased, in, the, last, half, century, the, increase, had, not, been, proportionate, to, the, growth, of, the, peasant, population, which, had, doubled, there, was, general, agreement, at, the, turn, of, the, century, that, russia, faced, a, grave, and, intensifying, agrarian, crisis, due, mainly, to, rural, overpopulation, with, an, annual, excess, of, fifteen, to, eighteen, live, births, over, deaths, per, 1, 000, inhabitants, the, investigations, revealed, many, difficulties, but, the, committees, could, not, find, solutions, that, were, both, sensible, and, acceptable, to, the, government, russia, was, a, multi, ethnic, empire, nineteenth, century, russians, saw, cultures, and, religions, in, a, clear, hierarchy, non, russian, cultures, were, tolerated, in, the, empire, but, were, not, necessarily, respected, culturally, europe, was, favored, over, asia, as, was, orthodox, christianity, over, other, religions, for, generations, russian, jews, had, been, considered, a, special, problem, jews, constituted, only, about, 4, of, the, population, but, were, concentrated, in, the, western, borderlands, like, other, minorities, in, russia, the, jews, lived, miserable, and, circumscribed, lives, forbidden, to, settle, or, acquire, land, outside, the, cities, and, towns, legally, limited, in, attendance, at, secondary, school, and, higher, schools, virtually, barred, from, legal, professions, denied, the, right, to, vote, for, municipal, councilors, and, excluded, from, services, in, the, navy, or, the, guards, the, government, s, treatment, of, jews, although, considered, a, separate, issue, was, similar, to, its, policies, in, dealing, with, all, national, and, religious, minorities, historian, theodore, weeks, notes, russian, administrators, who, never, succeeded, in, coming, up, with, a, legal, definition, of, pole, despite, the, decades, of, restrictions, on, that, ethnic, group, regularly, spoke, of, individuals, of, polish, descent, or, alternatively, of, russian, descent, making, identity, a, function, of, birth, this, policy, only, succeeded, in, producing, or, aggravating, feelings, of, disloyalty, there, was, growing, impatience, with, their, inferior, status, and, resentment, against, russification, russification, is, cultural, assimilation, definable, as, a, process, culminating, in, the, disappearance, of, a, given, group, as, a, recognizably, distinct, element, within, a, larger, society, besides, the, imposition, of, a, uniform, russian, culture, throughout, the, empire, the, government, s, pursuit, of, russification, especially, during, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, had, political, motives, after, the, emancipation, of, the, serfs, in, 1861, the, russian, state, was, compelled, to, take, into, account, public, opinion, but, the, government, failed, to, gain, the, public, s, support, another, motive, for, russification, policies, was, the, polish, uprising, of, 1863, unlike, other, minority, nationalities, the, poles, in, the, eyes, of, the, tsar, were, a, direct, threat, to, the, empire, s, stability, after, the, rebellion, was, crushed, the, government, implemented, policies, to, reduce, polish, cultural, influences, in, the, 1870s, the, government, began, to, distrust, german, elements, on, the, western, border, the, russian, government, felt, that, the, unification, of, germany, would, upset, the, power, balance, among, the, great, powers, of, europe, and, that, germany, would, use, its, strength, against, russia, the, government, thought, that, the, borders, would, be, defended, better, if, the, borderland, were, more, russian, in, character, the, culmination, of, cultural, diversity, created, a, cumbersome, nationality, problem, that, plagued, the, russian, government, in, the, years, leading, up, to, the, revolution, the, economic, situation, in, russia, before, the, revolution, presented, a, grim, picture, the, government, had, experimented, with, laissez, faire, capitalist, policies, but, this, strategy, largely, failed, to, gain, traction, within, the, russian, economy, until, the, 1890s, meanwhile, agricultural, productivity, stagnated, while, international, prices, for, grain, dropped, and, russia, s, foreign, debt, and, need, for, imports, grew, war, and, military, preparations, continued, to, consume, government, revenues, at, the, same, time, the, peasant, taxpayers, ability, to, pay, was, strained, to, the, utmost, leading, to, widespread, famine, in, 1891, in, the, 1890s, under, finance, minister, sergei, witte, a, crash, governmental, program, was, proposed, to, promote, industrialization, his, policies, included, heavy, government, expenditures, for, railroad, building, and, operations, subsidies, and, supporting, services, for, private, industrialists, high, protective, tariffs, for, russian, industries, especially, heavy, industry, an, increase, in, exports, currency, stabilization, and, encouragement, of, foreign, investments, his, plan, was, successful, and, during, the, 1890s, russian, industrial, growth, averaged, 8, percent, per, year, railroad, mileage, grew, from, a, very, substantial, base, by, 40, percent, between, 1892, and, 1902, ironically, witte, s, success, in, implementing, this, program, helped, spur, the, 1905, revolution, and, eventually, the, 1917, revolution, because, it, exacerbated, social, tensions, besides, dangerously, concentrating, a, proletariat, a, professional, and, a, rebellious, student, body, in, centers, of, political, power, industrialization, infuriated, both, these, new, forces, and, the, traditional, rural, classes, the, government, policy, of, financing, industrialization, through, taxing, peasants, forced, millions, of, peasants, to, work, in, towns, the, peasant, worker, saw, his, labor, in, the, factory, as, the, means, to, consolidate, his, family, s, economic, position, in, the, village, and, played, a, role, in, determining, the, social, consciousness, of, the, urban, proletariat, the, new, concentrations, and, flows, of, peasants, spread, urban, ideas, to, the, countryside, breaking, down, isolation, of, peasants, on, communes, industrial, workers, began, to, feel, dissatisfaction, with, the, tsarist, government, despite, the, protective, labour, laws, the, government, decreed, some, of, those, laws, included, the, prohibition, of, children, under, 12, from, working, with, the, exception, of, night, work, in, glass, factories, employment, of, children, aged, 12, to, 15, was, prohibited, on, sundays, and, holidays, workers, had, to, be, paid, in, cash, at, least, once, a, month, and, limits, were, placed, on, the, size, and, bases, of, fines, for, workers, who, were, tardy, employers, were, prohibited, from, charging, workers, for, the, cost, of, lighting, of, the, shops, and, plants, despite, these, labour, protections, the, workers, believed, that, the, laws, were, not, enough, to, free, them, from, unfair, and, inhumane, practices, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, russian, industrial, workers, worked, on, average, 11, hours, per, day, 10, hours, on, saturday, factory, conditions, were, perceived, as, grueling, and, often, unsafe, and, attempts, at, independent, unions, were, often, not, accepted, many, workers, were, forced, to, work, beyond, the, maximum, of, 11, 1, 2, hours, per, day, others, were, still, subject, to, arbitrary, and, excessive, fines, for, tardiness, mistakes, in, their, work, or, absence, russian, industrial, workers, were, also, the, lowest, wage, workers, in, europe, although, the, cost, of, living, in, russia, was, low, the, average, worker, s, 16, rubles, per, month, could, not, buy, the, equal, of, what, the, french, worker, s, 110, francs, would, buy, for, him, furthermore, the, same, labour, laws, prohibited, the, organisation, of, trade, unions, and, strikes, dissatisfaction, turned, into, despair, for, many, impoverished, workers, which, made, them, more, sympathetic, to, radical, ideas, these, discontented, radicalized, workers, became, key, to, the, revolution, by, participating, in, illegal, strikes, and, revolutionary, protests, the, government, responded, by, arresting, labour, agitators, and, enacting, more, paternalistic, legislation, introduced, in, 1900, by, sergei, zubatov, head, of, the, moscow, security, department, police, socialism, planned, to, have, workers, form, workers, societies, with, police, approval, to, provide, healthful, fraternal, activities, and, opportunities, for, cooperative, self, help, together, with, protection, against, influences, that, might, have, inimical, effect, on, loyalty, to, job, or, country, some, of, these, groups, organised, in, moscow, odessa, kyiv, mykolaiv, and, kharkiv, but, these, groups, and, the, idea, of, police, socialism, failed, from, 1900, to, 1903, the, period, of, industrial, depression, caused, many, firm, bankruptcies, and, a, reduction, in, the, employment, rate, employees, were, restive, they, would, join, legal, organisations, but, turn, the, organisations, toward, an, end, that, the, organisations, sponsors, did, not, intend, workers, used, legitimate, means, to, organise, strikes, or, to, draw, support, for, striking, workers, outside, these, groups, a, strike, that, began, in, 1902, by, workers, in, the, railroad, shops, in, vladikavkaz, and, rostov, on, don, created, such, a, response, that, by, the, next, summer, 225, 000, in, various, industries, in, southern, russia, and, transcaucasia, were, on, strike, these, were, not, the, first, illegal, strikes, in, the, country, s, history, but, their, aims, and, the, political, awareness, and, support, among, workers, and, non, workers, made, them, more, troubling, to, the, government, than, earlier, strikes, the, government, responded, by, closing, all, legal, organisations, by, the, end, of, 1903, the, minister, of, the, interior, plehve, designated, schools, as, a, pressing, problem, for, the, government, but, he, did, not, realize, it, was, only, a, symptom, of, antigovernment, feelings, among, the, educated, class, students, of, universities, other, schools, of, higher, learning, and, occasionally, of, secondary, schools, and, theological, seminaries, were, part, of, this, group, student, radicalism, began, around, the, time, tsar, alexander, ii, came, to, power, alexander, abolished, serfdom, and, enacted, fundamental, reforms, in, the, legal, and, administrative, structure, of, the, russian, empire, which, were, revolutionary, for, their, time, he, lifted, many, restrictions, on, universities, and, abolished, obligatory, uniforms, and, military, discipline, this, ushered, in, a, new, freedom, in, the, content, and, reading, lists, of, academic, courses, in, turn, that, created, student, subcultures, as, youth, were, willing, to, live, in, poverty, in, order, to, receive, an, education, as, universities, expanded, there, was, a, rapid, growth, of, newspapers, journals, and, an, organisation, of, public, lectures, and, professional, societies, the, 1860s, was, a, time, when, the, emergence, of, a, new, public, sphere, was, created, in, social, life, and, professional, groups, this, created, the, idea, of, their, right, to, have, an, independent, opinion, the, government, was, alarmed, by, these, communities, and, in, 1861, tightened, restrictions, on, admission, and, prohibited, student, organisations, these, restrictions, resulted, in, the, first, ever, student, demonstration, held, in, st, petersburg, which, led, to, a, two, year, closure, of, the, university, the, consequent, conflict, with, the, state, was, an, important, factor, in, the, chronic, student, protests, over, subsequent, decades, the, atmosphere, of, the, early, 1860s, gave, rise, to, political, engagement, by, students, outside, universities, that, became, a, tenet, of, student, radicalism, by, the, 1870s, student, radicals, described, the, special, duty, and, mission, of, the, student, as, such, to, spread, the, new, word, of, liberty, students, were, called, upon, to, extend, their, freedoms, into, society, to, repay, the, privilege, of, learning, by, serving, the, people, and, to, become, in, nikolai, ogarev, s, phrase, apostles, of, knowledge, during, the, next, two, decades, universities, produced, a, significant, share, of, russia, s, revolutionaries, prosecution, records, from, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, show, that, more, than, half, of, all, political, offences, were, committed, by, students, despite, being, a, minute, proportion, of, the, population, the, tactics, of, the, left, wing, students, proved, to, be, remarkably, effective, far, beyond, what, any, of, the, students, would, have, dreamed, sensing, that, neither, the, university, administrations, nor, the, government, possessed, the, will, or, authority, to, enforce, regulations, radicals, simply, went, ahead, with, their, plans, to, turn, the, schools, into, centres, of, political, activity, for, students, and, non, students, alike, they, took, up, problems, that, were, unrelated, to, their, proper, employment, and, displayed, defiance, and, radicalism, by, boycotting, examinations, rioting, arranging, marches, in, sympathy, with, strikers, and, political, prisoners, circulating, petitions, and, writing, anti, government, propaganda, this, disturbed, the, government, but, it, believed, the, cause, was, lack, of, training, in, patriotism, and, religion, therefore, the, curriculum, was, toughened, up, to, emphasize, classical, language, and, mathematics, in, secondary, schools, but, defiance, continued, expulsion, exile, and, forced, military, service, also, did, not, stop, students, in, fact, when, the, official, decision, to, overhaul, the, whole, educational, system, was, finally, made, in, 1904, and, to, that, end, vladimir, glazov, head, of, general, staff, academy, was, selected, as, minister, of, education, the, students, had, grown, bolder, and, more, resistant, than, ever, the, events, of, 1905, came, after, progressive, and, academic, agitation, for, more, political, democracy, and, limits, to, tsarist, rule, in, russia, and, an, increase, in, strikes, by, workers, against, employers, for, radical, economic, demands, and, union, recognition, especially, in, southern, russia, as, an, example, trotsky, who, would, assume, a, central, role, in, the, 1905, revolution, would, write, several, proclamations, urging, for, improved, economic, conditions, political, rights, and, the, use, of, strike, action, against, the, tsarist, regime, on, behalf, of, workers, many, socialists, view, this, as, a, period, when, the, rising, revolutionary, movement, was, met, with, rising, reactionary, movements, as, rosa, luxemburg, stated, in, 1906, in, the, mass, strike, when, collective, strike, activity, was, met, with, what, is, perceived, as, repression, from, an, autocratic, state, economic, and, political, demands, grew, into, and, reinforced, each, other, russian, progressives, formed, the, union, of, zemstvo, constitutionalists, in, 1903, and, the, union, of, liberation, in, 1904, which, called, for, a, constitutional, monarchy, russian, socialists, formed, two, major, groups, the, socialist, revolutionary, party, founded, in, 1902, which, followed, the, russian, populist, tradition, and, the, marxist, russian, social, democratic, labour, party, founded, in, 1898, in, late, 1904, liberals, started, a, series, of, banquets, modeled, on, the, campagne, des, banquets, leading, up, to, the, french, revolution, of, 1848, nominally, celebrating, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, liberal, court, statutes, but, actually, an, attempt, to, circumvent, laws, against, political, gatherings, the, banquets, resulted, in, calls, for, political, reforms, and, a, constitution, in, november, 1904, a, zemsky, congress, russian, a, gathering, of, zemstvo, delegates, representing, all, levels, of, russian, society, called, for, a, constitution, civil, liberties, and, a, parliament, on, 13, december, 1904, the, moscow, city, duma, passed, a, resolution, demanding, the, establishment, of, an, elected, national, legislature, full, freedom, of, the, press, and, freedom, of, religion, similar, resolutions, and, appeals, from, other, city, dumas, and, zemstvo, councils, followed, emperor, nicholas, ii, made, a, move, to, meet, many, of, these, demands, appointing, liberal, pyotr, dmitrievich, sviatopolk, mirsky, as, minister, of, the, interior, after, the, july, 1904, assassination, of, vyacheslav, von, plehve, on, 25, december, 1904, the, emperor, issued, a, manifesto, promising, the, broadening, of, the, zemstvo, system, and, more, authority, for, local, municipal, councils, insurance, for, industrial, workers, the, emancipation, of, inorodtsy, and, the, abolition, of, censorship, the, crucial, demand, that, for, a, representative, national, legislature, was, missing, in, the, manifesto, worker, strikes, in, the, caucasus, broke, out, in, march, 1902, strikes, on, the, railways, originating, from, pay, disputes, took, on, other, issues, and, drew, in, other, industries, culminating, in, a, general, strike, at, rostov, on, don, in, november, 1902, daily, meetings, of, 15, 000, to, 20, 000, heard, openly, revolutionary, appeals, for, the, first, time, before, a, massacre, defeated, the, strikes, but, reaction, to, the, massacres, brought, political, demands, to, purely, economic, ones, luxemburg, described, the, situation, in, 1903, by, saying, the, whole, of, south, russia, in, may, june, and, july, was, aflame, including, baku, where, separate, wage, struggles, culminated, in, a, citywide, general, strike, and, tiflis, where, commercial, workers, gained, a, reduction, in, the, working, day, and, were, joined, by, factory, workers, in, 1904, massive, strike, waves, broke, out, in, odessa, in, the, spring, in, kyiv, in, july, and, in, baku, in, december, this, all, set, the, stage, for, the, strikes, in, st, petersburg, in, december, 1904, to, january, 1905, seen, as, the, first, step, in, the, 1905, revolution, another, contributing, factor, behind, the, revolution, was, the, bloody, sunday, massacre, of, protesters, that, took, place, in, january, 1905, in, st, petersburg, sparked, a, spate, of, civil, unrest, in, the, russian, empire, lenin, urged, bolsheviks, to, take, a, greater, role, in, the, events, encouraging, violent, insurrection, in, doing, so, he, adopted, sr, slogans, regarding, armed, insurrection, mass, terror, and, the, expropriation, of, gentry, land, resulting, in, menshevik, accusations, that, he, had, deviated, from, orthodox, marxism, in, turn, he, insisted, that, the, bolsheviks, split, completely, with, the, mensheviks, many, bolsheviks, refused, and, both, groups, attended, the, third, rsdlp, congress, held, in, london, in, april, 1905, at, the, brotherhood, church, lenin, presented, many, of, his, ideas, in, the, pamphlet, two, tactics, of, social, democracy, in, the, democratic, revolution, published, in, august, 1905, here, he, predicted, that, russia,

franchise, towards, universal, suffrage, and, establishing, the, duma, as, the, central, legislative, body, the, tsar, waited, and, argued, for, three, days, but, finally, signed, the, manifesto, on, 30, october, 1905, citing, his, desire, to, avoid, a, massacre, and, his, realisation, that, there, was, insufficient, military, force, available, to, pursue, alternative, options, he, regretted, signing, the, document, saying, that, he, felt, sick, with, shame, at, this, betrayal, of, the, dynasty, the, betrayal, was, complete, when, the, manifesto, was, proclaimed, there, were, spontaneous, demonstrations, of, support, in, all, the, major, cities, the, strikes, in, saint, petersburg, and, elsewhere, officially, ended, or, quickly, collapsed, a, political, amnesty, was, also, offered, the, concessions, came, hand, in, hand, with, renewed, and, brutal, action, against, the, unrest, there, was, also, a, backlash, from, the, conservative, elements, of, society, with, right, wing, attacks, on, strikers, left, wingers, and, jews, while, the, russian, liberals, were, satisfied, by, the, october, manifesto, and, prepared, for, upcoming, duma, elections, radical, socialists, and, revolutionaries, denounced, the, elections, and, called, for, an, armed, uprising, to, destroy, the, empire, some, of, the, november, uprising, of, 1905, in, sevastopol, headed, by, retired, naval, lieutenant, pyotr, schmidt, was, directed, against, the, government, while, some, was, undirected, it, included, terrorism, worker, strikes, peasant, unrest, and, military, mutinies, and, was, only, suppressed, after, a, fierce, battle, the, trans, baikal, railroad, fell, into, the, hands, of, striker, committees, and, demobilised, soldiers, returning, from, manchuria, after, the, russo, japanese, war, the, tsar, had, to, send, a, special, detachment, of, loyal, troops, along, the, trans, siberian, railway, to, restore, order, between, 5, and, 7, december, there, was, a, general, strike, by, russian, workers, the, government, sent, troops, on, 7, december, and, a, bitter, street, by, street, fight, began, a, week, later, the, semyonovsky, regiment, was, deployed, and, used, artillery, to, break, up, demonstrations, and, to, shell, workers, districts, on, 18, december, with, around, a, thousand, people, dead, and, parts, of, the, city, in, ruins, the, workers, surrendered, after, a, final, spasm, in, moscow, the, uprisings, ended, in, december, 1905, according, to, figures, presented, in, the, duma, by, professor, maksim, kovalevsky, by, april, 1906, more, than, 14, 000, people, had, been, executed, and, 75, 000, imprisoned, historian, brian, taylor, states, the, number, of, deaths, in, the, 1905, revolution, was, in, the, thousands, and, notes, one, source, that, puts, the, figure, at, over, 13, 000, deaths, following, the, revolution, of, 1905, the, tsar, made, last, attempts, to, save, his, regime, and, offered, reforms, similar, to, most, rulers, when, pressured, by, a, revolutionary, movement, the, military, remained, loyal, throughout, the, revolution, of, 1905, as, shown, by, their, shooting, of, revolutionaries, when, ordered, by, the, tsar, making, overthrow, difficult, these, reforms, were, outlined, in, a, precursor, to, the, constitution, of, 1906, known, as, the, october, manifesto, which, created, the, imperial, duma, the, russian, constitution, of, 1906, also, known, as, the, fundamental, laws, set, up, a, multiparty, system, and, a, limited, constitutional, monarchy, the, revolutionaries, were, quelled, and, satisfied, with, the, reforms, but, it, was, not, enough, to, prevent, the, 1917, revolution, that, would, later, topple, the, tsar, s, regime, there, had, been, earlier, attempts, in, establishing, a, russian, duma, before, the, october, manifesto, but, these, attempts, faced, dogged, resistance, one, attempt, in, july, 1905, called, the, bulygin, duma, tried, to, reduce, the, assembly, into, a, consultative, body, it, also, proposed, limiting, voting, rights, to, those, with, a, higher, property, qualification, excluding, industrial, workers, both, sides, the, opposition, and, the, conservatives, were, not, pleased, with, the, results, another, attempt, in, august, 1905, was, almost, successful, but, that, too, died, when, nicholas, insisted, on, the, duma, s, functions, be, relegated, to, an, advisory, position, the, october, manifesto, aside, from, granting, the, population, the, freedom, of, speech, and, assembly, proclaimed, that, no, law, would, be, passed, without, examination, and, approval, by, the, imperial, duma, the, manifesto, also, extended, the, suffrage, to, universal, proportions, allowing, for, greater, participation, in, the, duma, though, the, electoral, law, in, 11, december, still, excluded, women, nevertheless, the, tsar, retained, the, power, of, veto, propositions, for, restrictions, to, the, duma, s, legislative, powers, remained, persistent, a, decree, on, 20, february, 1906, transformed, the, state, council, the, advisory, body, into, a, second, chamber, with, legislative, powers, equal, to, those, of, the, duma, not, only, did, this, transformation, violate, the, manifesto, but, the, council, became, a, buffer, zone, between, the, tsar, and, duma, slowing, whatever, progress, the, latter, could, achieve, even, three, days, before, the, duma, s, first, session, on, 24, april, 1906, the, fundamental, laws, further, limited, the, assembly, s, movement, by, giving, the, tsar, the, sole, power, to, appoint, dismiss, ministers, adding, insult, was, the, indication, that, the, tsar, alone, had, control, over, many, facets, of, political, reins, all, without, the, duma, s, expressed, permission, the, trap, seemed, perfectly, set, for, the, unsuspecting, duma, by, the, time, the, assembly, convened, in, 27, april, it, quickly, found, itself, unable, to, do, much, without, violating, the, fundamental, laws, defeated, and, frustrated, the, majority, of, the, assembly, voted, no, confidence, and, handed, in, their, resignations, after, a, few, weeks, on, 13, may, the, attacks, on, the, duma, were, not, confined, to, its, legislative, powers, by, the, time, the, duma, opened, it, was, missing, crucial, support, from, its, populace, thanks, in, no, small, part, to, the, government, s, return, to, pre, manifesto, levels, of, suppression, the, soviets, were, forced, to, lay, low, for, a, long, time, while, the, zemstvos, turned, against, the, duma, when, the, issue, of, land, appropriation, came, up, the, issue, of, land, appropriation, was, the, most, contentious, of, the, duma, s, appeals, the, duma, proposed, that, the, government, distribute, its, treasury, monastic, and, imperial, lands, and, seize, private, estates, as, well, the, duma, in, fact, was, preparing, to, alienate, some, of, its, more, affluent, supporters, a, decision, that, left, the, assembly, without, the, necessary, political, power, to, be, efficient, nicholas, ii, remained, wary, of, having, to, share, power, with, reform, minded, bureaucrats, when, the, pendulum, in, 1906, elections, swung, to, the, left, nicholas, immediately, ordered, the, duma, s, dissolution, just, after, 73, days, hoping, to, further, squeeze, the, life, out, of, the, assembly, he, appointed, a, tougher, prime, minister, in, petr, stolypin, as, the, liberal, witte, s, replacement, much, to, nicholas, s, chagrin, stolypin, attempted, to, bring, about, acts, of, reform, land, reform, while, retaining, measures, favorable, to, the, regime, stepping, up, the, number, of, executions, of, revolutionaries, after, the, revolution, subsided, he, was, able, to, bring, economic, growth, back, to, russia, s, industries, a, period, which, lasted, until, 1914, but, stolypin, s, efforts, did, nothing, to, prevent, the, collapse, of, the, monarchy, nor, seemed, to, satisfy, the, conservatives, stolypin, died, from, a, bullet, wound, fired, by, a, revolutionary, dmitry, bogrov, on, 5, september, 1911, even, after, bloody, sunday, and, defeat, in, the, russo, japanese, war, nicholas, ii, had, been, slow, to, offer, a, meaningful, solution, to, the, social, and, political, crisis, at, this, point, he, became, more, concerned, with, his, personal, affairs, such, as, the, illness, of, his, son, whose, struggle, with, haemophilia, was, overseen, by, rasputin, nicholas, also, refused, to, believe, that, the, population, was, demanding, changes, in, the, autocratic, regime, seeing, public, opinion, as, mainly, the, intelligentsia, and, believing, himself, to, be, the, patronly, father, figure, to, the, russian, people, sergei, witte, the, minister, of, russia, frustratedly, argued, with, the, tsar, that, an, immediate, implementation, of, reforms, was, needed, to, retain, order, in, the, country, it, was, only, after, the, revolution, started, picking, up, steam, that, nicholas, was, forced, to, make, concessions, by, writing, the, october, manifesto, issued, on, 17, october, 1905, the, manifesto, stated, that, the, government, would, grant, the, population, reforms, such, as, the, right, to, vote, and, to, convene, in, assemblies, its, main, provisions, were, despite, what, seemed, to, be, a, moment, for, celebration, for, russia, s, population, and, the, reformists, the, manifesto, was, rife, with, problems, aside, from, the, absence, of, the, word, constitution, one, issue, with, the, manifesto, was, its, timing, by, october, 1905, nicholas, was, already, dealing, with, a, revolution, another, problem, surfaced, in, the, conscience, of, nicholas, himself, witte, said, in, 1911, that, the, manifesto, was, written, only, to, get, the, pressure, off, the, monarch, s, back, that, it, was, not, a, voluntary, act, in, fact, the, writers, hoped, that, the, manifesto, would, sow, discord, into, the, camp, of, the, autocracy, s, enemies, and, bring, order, back, to, russia, one, immediate, effect, it, did, have, for, a, while, was, the, start, of, the, days, of, freedom, a, six, week, period, from, 17, october, to, early, december, this, period, witnessed, an, unprecedented, level, of, freedom, on, all, publications, revolutionary, papers, brochures, etc, even, though, the, tsar, officially, retained, the, power, to, censor, provocative, material, this, opportunity, allowed, the, press, to, address, the, tsar, and, government, officials, in, a, harsh, critical, tone, previously, unheard, of, the, freedom, of, speech, also, opened, the, floodgates, for, meetings, and, organised, political, parties, in, moscow, alone, over, 400, meetings, took, place, in, the, first, four, weeks, some, of, the, political, parties, that, came, out, of, these, meetings, were, the, constitutional, democrats, kadets, social, democrats, socialist, revolutionaries, octobrists, and, the, far, rightist, union, of, the, russian, people, among, all, the, groups, that, benefited, most, from, the, days, of, freedoms, were, the, labour, unions, in, fact, the, days, of, freedom, witnessed, unionisation, in, the, history, of, the, russian, empire, at, its, apex, at, least, 67, unions, were, established, in, moscow, as, well, as, 58, in, st, petersburg, the, majority, of, both, combined, were, formed, in, november, 1905, alone, for, the, soviets, it, was, a, watershed, period, of, time, nearly, 50, of, the, unions, in, st, petersburg, came, under, soviet, control, while, in, moscow, the, soviets, had, around, 80, 000, members, this, large, sector, of, power, allowed, the, soviets, enough, clout, to, form, their, own, militias, in, st, petersburg, alone, the, soviets, claimed, around, 6, 000, armed, members, with, the, purpose, of, protecting, the, meetings, perhaps, empowered, in, their, newfound, window, of, opportunity, the, st, petersburg, soviets, along, with, other, socialist, parties, called, for, armed, struggles, against, the, tsarist, government, a, war, call, that, no, doubt, alarmed, the, government, not, only, were, the, workers, motivated, but, the, days, of, freedom, also, had, an, earthquake, like, effect, on, the, peasant, collective, as, well, seeing, an, opening, in, the, autocracy, s, waning, authority, thanks, to, the, manifesto, the, peasants, with, a, political, organisation, took, to, the, streets, in, revolt, in, response, the, government, exerted, its, forces, in, campaigns, to, subdue, and, repress, both, the, peasants, and, the, workers, consequences, were, now, in, full, force, with, a, pretext, in, their, hands, the, government, spent, the, month, of, december, 1905, regaining, the, level, of, authority, once, lost, to, bloody, sunday, ironically, the, writers, of, the, october, manifesto, were, caught, off, guard, by, the, surge, in, revolts, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, writing, the, october, manifesto, bordered, on, the, government, s, fear, of, the, revolutionary, movement, in, fact, many, officials, believed, this, fear, was, practically, the, sole, reason, for, the, manifesto, s, creation, in, the, first, place, among, those, more, scared, was, dmitri, feodorovich, trepov, governor, general, of, st, petersburg, and, deputy, minister, of, the, interior, trepov, urged, nicholas, ii, to, stick, to, the, principles, in, the, manifesto, for, every, retreat, would, be, hazardous, to, the, dynasty, the, russian, constitution, of, 1906, was, published, on, the, eve, of, the, convocation, of, the, first, duma, the, new, fundamental, law, was, enacted, to, institute, promises, of, the, october, manifesto, as, well, as, add, new, reforms, the, tsar, was, confirmed, as, absolute, leader, with, complete, control, of, the, executive, foreign, policy, church, and, the, armed, forces, the, structure, of, the, duma, was, changed, becoming, a, lower, chamber, below, the, council, of, ministers, and, was, half, elected, half, appointed, by, the, tsar, legislations, had, to, be, approved, by, the, duma, the, council, and, the, tsar, to, become, law, the, fundamental, state, laws, were, the, culmination, of, the, whole, sequence, of, events, set, in, motion, in, october, 1905, and, which, consolidated, the, new, status, quo, the, introduction, of, the, russian, constitution, of, 1906, was, not, simply, an, institution, of, the, october, manifesto, the, introduction, of, the, constitution, states, and, thus, emphasizes, the, following, the, constitution, did, not, mention, any, of, the, provisions, of, the, october, manifesto, while, it, did, enact, the, provisions, laid, out, previously, its, sole, purpose, seems, again, to, be, the, propaganda, for, the, monarchy, and, to, simply, not, fall, back, on, prior, promises, the, provisions, and, the, new, constitutional, monarchy, did, not, satisfy, russians, and, lenin, the, constitution, lasted, until, the, fall, of, the, empire, in, 1917, the, years, 1906, and, 1907, saw, a, decline, of, mass, movements, strikes, and, protests, and, a, rise, of, overt, political, violence, combat, groups, such, as, the, sr, combat, organization, carried, out, many, assassinations, targeting, civil, servants, and, police, and, robberies, between, 1906, and, 1909, revolutionaries, killed, 7, 293, people, of, whom, 2, 640, were, officials, and, wounded, 8, 061, notable, victims, included, the, years, of, revolution, were, marked, by, a, dramatic, rise, in, the, numbers, of, death, sentences, and, executions, different, figures, on, the, number, of, executions, were, compared, by, senator, nikolai, tagantsev, and, are, listed, in, the, table, these, numbers, reflect, only, executions, of, civilians, and, do, not, include, a, large, number, of, summary, executions, by, punitive, army, detachments, and, executions, of, military, mutineers, peter, kropotkin, an, anarchist, noted, that, official, statistics, excluded, executions, conducted, during, punitive, expeditions, especially, in, siberia, caucasus, and, the, baltic, provinces, by, 1906, some, 4, 509, political, prisoners, were, incarcerated, in, russian, poland, 20, percent, of, the, empire, s, total, ivanovo, voznesensk,
