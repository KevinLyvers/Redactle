civil, rights, movements, are, a, worldwide, series, of, political, movements, for, equality, before, the, law, that, peaked, in, the, 1960s, in, many, situations, they, have, been, characterized, by, nonviolent, protests, or, have, taken, the, form, of, campaigns, of, civil, resistance, aimed, at, achieving, change, through, nonviolent, forms, of, resistance, in, some, situations, they, have, been, accompanied, or, followed, by, civil, unrest, and, armed, rebellion, the, process, has, been, long, and, tenuous, in, many, countries, and, many, of, these, movements, did, not, or, have, yet, to, fully, achieve, their, goals, although, the, efforts, of, these, movements, have, led, to, improvements, in, the, legal, rights, of, some, previously, oppressed, groups, of, people, in, some, places, the, main, aim, of, the, successful, civil, rights, movement, and, other, social, movements, for, civil, rights, included, ensuring, that, the, rights, of, all, people, were, and, are, equally, protected, by, the, law, these, include, but, are, not, limited, to, the, rights, of, minorities, women, s, rights, disability, rights, and, lgbt, rights, northern, ireland, is, a, part, of, the, united, kingdom, which, has, witnessed, violence, over, many, decades, known, as, the, troubles, arising, from, tensions, between, the, british, unionist, protestant, majority, and, the, irish, nationalist, catholic, minority, following, the, partition, of, ireland, in, 1920, the, civil, rights, struggle, in, northern, ireland, can, be, traced, to, activists, in, dungannon, led, by, austin, currie, who, were, fighting, for, equal, access, to, public, housing, for, the, members, of, the, catholic, community, this, domestic, issue, would, not, have, led, to, a, fight, for, civil, rights, were, it, not, for, the, fact, that, being, a, registered, householder, was, a, qualification, for, local, government, franchise, in, northern, ireland, in, january, 1964, the, campaign, for, social, justice, csj, was, launched, in, belfast, this, organisation, joined, the, struggle, for, better, housing, and, committed, itself, to, ending, discrimination, in, employment, the, csj, promised, the, catholic, community, that, their, cries, would, be, heard, they, challenged, the, government, and, promised, that, they, would, take, their, case, to, the, commission, for, human, rights, in, strasbourg, and, to, the, united, nations, having, started, with, basic, domestic, issues, the, civil, rights, struggle, in, northern, ireland, escalated, to, a, full, scale, movement, that, found, its, embodiment, in, the, northern, ireland, civil, rights, association, nicra, campaigned, in, the, late, sixties, and, early, seventies, consciously, modelling, itself, on, the, american, civil, rights, movement, and, using, similar, methods, of, civil, resistance, nicra, organised, marches, and, protests, to, demand, equal, rights, and, an, end, to, discrimination, nicra, originally, had, five, main, demands, all, of, these, specific, demands, were, aimed, at, an, ultimate, goal, that, had, been, the, one, of, women, at, the, very, beginning, the, end, of, discrimination, civil, rights, activists, all, over, northern, ireland, soon, launched, a, campaign, of, civil, resistance, there, was, opposition, from, loyalists, who, were, aided, by, the, royal, ulster, constabulary, ruc, northern, ireland, s, police, force, at, this, point, the, ruc, was, over, 90, protestant, violence, escalated, resulting, in, the, rise, of, the, provisional, irish, republican, army, ira, from, the, catholic, community, a, group, reminiscent, of, those, from, the, war, of, independence, and, the, civil, war, that, occurred, in, the, 1920s, that, had, launched, a, campaign, of, violence, to, end, british, rule, in, northern, ireland, loyalist, paramilitaries, countered, this, with, a, defensive, campaign, of, violence, and, the, british, government, responded, with, a, policy, of, internment, without, trial, of, suspected, ira, members, for, more, than, 300, people, the, internment, lasted, several, years, the, huge, majority, of, those, interned, by, the, british, forces, were, catholic, in, 1978, in, a, case, brought, by, the, government, of, the, republic, of, ireland, against, the, government, of, the, united, kingdom, the, european, court, of, human, rights, ruled, that, the, interrogation, techniques, approved, for, use, by, british, interrogators, on, internees, in, northern, ireland, amounted, to, inhuman, and, degrading, treatment, the, ira, encouraged, republicans, to, join, in, the, movement, for, civil, rights, but, never, controlled, nicra, the, northern, ireland, civil, rights, association, fought, for, the, end, of, discrimination, toward, catholics, and, did, not, take, a, position, on, the, legitimacy, of, the, state, republican, leader, gerry, adams, explained, subsequently, that, catholics, saw, that, it, was, possible, for, them, to, have, their, demands, heard, he, wrote, that, we, were, able, to, see, an, example, of, the, fact, that, you, didn, t, just, have, to, take, it, you, could, fight, back, for, an, account, and, critique, of, the, movements, for, civil, rights, in, northern, ireland, reflecting, on, the, ambiguous, link, between, the, causes, of, civil, rights, and, opposition, to, the, union, with, the, united, kingdom, see, the, work, of, richard, english, one, of, the, most, important, events, in, the, era, of, civil, rights, in, northern, ireland, took, place, in, derry, which, escalated, the, conflict, from, peaceful, civil, disobedience, to, armed, conflict, the, battle, of, the, bogside, started, on, 12, august, when, an, apprentice, boys, a, protestant, order, parade, passed, through, waterloo, place, where, a, large, crowd, was, gathered, at, the, mouth, of, william, street, on, the, edge, of, the, bogside, different, accounts, describe, the, first, outbreak, of, violence, with, reports, stating, that, it, was, either, an, attack, by, youth, from, the, bogside, on, the, ruc, or, fighting, broke, out, between, protestants, and, catholics, the, violence, escalated, and, barricades, were, erected, proclaiming, this, district, to, be, the, free, derry, bogsiders, carried, on, fights, with, the, ruc, for, days, using, stones, and, petrol, bombs, the, government, finally, withdrew, the, ruc, and, replaced, it, with, the, british, army, which, disbanded, the, crowds, of, catholics, who, were, barricaded, in, the, bogside, bloody, sunday, 30, january, 1972, in, derry, is, seen, by, some, as, a, turning, point, in, the, movement, for, civil, rights, fourteen, unarmed, catholic, civil, rights, marchers, protesting, against, internment, were, shot, and, killed, by, soldiers, from, the, parachute, regiment, the, peace, process, has, made, significant, gains, in, recent, years, through, open, dialogue, from, all, parties, a, state, of, ceasefire, by, all, major, paramilitary, groups, has, lasted, a, stronger, economy, improved, northern, ireland, s, standard, of, living, civil, rights, issues, have, become, less, of, a, concern, for, many, in, northern, ireland, over, the, past, 20, years, as, laws, and, policies, protecting, their, rights, and, forms, of, affirmative, action, have, been, implemented, for, all, government, offices, and, many, private, businesses, tensions, still, exist, but, the, vast, majority, of, citizens, are, no, longer, affected, by, violence, the, 1960s, brought, intense, political, and, social, change, to, the, canadian, province, of, quebec, with, the, election, of, liberal, premier, jean, lesage, after, the, death, of, maurice, duplessis, whose, government, was, widely, viewed, as, corrupt, these, changes, included, secularization, of, the, education, and, health, care, systems, which, were, both, heavily, controlled, by, the, roman, catholic, church, whose, support, for, duplessis, and, his, perceived, corruption, had, angered, many, qu, b, cois, policies, of, the, liberal, government, also, sought, to, give, quebec, more, economic, autonomy, such, as, the, nationalization, of, hydro, qu, bec, and, the, creation, of, public, companies, for, the, mining, forestry, iron, steel, and, petroleum, industries, of, the, province, other, changes, included, the, creation, of, the, r, gie, des, rentes, du, qu, bec, quebec, pension, plan, and, new, labour, codes, that, made, unionizing, easier, and, gave, workers, the, right, to, strike, the, social, and, economic, changes, of, the, quiet, revolution, gave, life, to, the, quebec, sovereignty, movement, as, more, and, more, qu, b, cois, saw, themselves, as, a, distinctly, culturally, different, from, the, rest, of, canada, the, segregationist, parti, qu, b, cois, was, created, in, 1968, and, won, the, 1976, quebec, general, election, they, enacted, legislation, meant, to, enshrine, french, as, the, language, of, business, in, the, province, while, also, controversially, restricting, the, usage, of, english, on, signs, and, restricting, the, eligibility, of, students, to, be, taught, in, english, a, radical, strand, of, french, canadian, nationalism, produced, the, front, de, lib, ration, du, qu, bec, flq, which, since, 1963, has, been, using, terrorism, to, make, quebec, a, sovereign, nation, in, october, 1970, in, response, to, the, arrest, of, some, of, its, members, earlier, in, the, year, the, flq, kidnapped, british, diplomat, james, cross, and, quebec, s, minister, of, labour, pierre, laporte, whom, they,

racial, discrimination, against, african, americans, and, other, disadvantaged, groups, between, 1954, and, 1968, particularly, in, the, southern, united, states, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, second, reconstruction, era, alluding, to, the, unresolved, issues, of, the, reconstruction, era, 1863, 77, after, 1890, the, system, of, jim, crow, disenfranchisement, and, second, class, citizenship, degraded, the, citizenship, rights, of, african, americans, especially, in, the, south, it, was, the, nadir, of, american, race, relations, there, were, three, main, aspects, racial, segregation, upheld, by, the, united, states, supreme, court, decision, in, plessy, v, ferguson, in, 1896, legally, mandated, by, southern, governments, voter, suppression, or, disfranchisement, in, the, southern, states, and, private, acts, of, violence, and, mass, racial, violence, aimed, at, african, americans, unhindered, or, encouraged, by, government, authorities, although, racial, discrimination, was, present, nationwide, the, combination, of, law, public, and, private, acts, of, discrimination, marginal, economic, opportunity, and, violence, directed, toward, african, americans, in, the, southern, states, became, known, as, jim, crow, noted, strategies, employed, prior, to, 1955, included, litigation, and, lobbying, attempts, by, the, national, association, for, the, advancement, of, colored, people, naacp, these, efforts, were, a, hallmark, of, the, early, american, civil, rights, movement, from, 1896, to, 1954, however, by, 1955, blacks, became, frustrated, by, gradual, approaches, to, implement, desegregation, by, federal, and, state, governments, and, the, massive, resistance, by, whites, the, black, leadership, adopted, a, combined, strategy, of, direct, action, with, nonviolence, sometimes, resulting, in, nonviolent, resistance, and, civil, disobedience, some, of, the, acts, of, nonviolence, and, civil, disobedience, produced, crisis, situations, between, practitioners, and, government, authorities, the, authorities, of, federal, state, and, local, governments, often, acted, with, an, immediate, response, to, end, the, crisis, situations, sometimes, in, the, practitioners, favor, some, of, the, different, forms, of, protests, and, or, civil, disobedience, employed, included, boycotts, as, successfully, practiced, by, the, montgomery, bus, boycott, 1955, 1956, in, alabama, which, gave, the, movement, one, of, its, more, famous, icons, in, rosa, parks, sit, ins, as, demonstrated, by, two, influential, events, the, greensboro, sit, in, 1960, in, north, carolina, and, the, nashville, sit, ins, in, nashville, tennessee, the, influential, 1963, birmingham, children, s, crusade, in, which, children, were, set, upon, by, the, local, authorities, with, fire, hoses, and, attack, dogs, and, longer, marches, as, exhibited, by, the, selma, to, montgomery, marches, 1965, in, alabama, which, at, first, was, resisted, and, attacked, by, the, state, and, local, authorities, and, resulted, in, the, 1965, voting, rights, act, the, evidence, of, changing, attitudes, could, also, be, seen, around, the, country, where, small, businesses, sprang, up, supporting, the, civil, rights, movement, such, as, new, jersey, s, everybody, s, luncheonette, besides, the, children, s, crusade, and, the, selma, to, montgomery, marches, another, illustrious, event, of, the, 1960s, civil, rights, movement, was, the, march, on, washington, for, jobs, and, freedom, in, august, 1963, it, is, best, remembered, for, the, i, have, a, dream, speech, by, martin, luther, king, jr, in, which, the, speech, turned, into, a, national, text, and, eclipsed, the, troubles, the, organizers, had, to, bring, to, march, forward, it, had, been, a, fairly, complicated, affair, to, bring, together, various, leaders, of, civil, rights, religious, and, labor, groups, as, the, name, of, the, march, implies, many, compromises, had, to, be, made, in, order, to, unite, the, followers, of, so, many, different, causes, the, march, on, washington, for, jobs, and, freedom, emphasized, the, combined, purposes, of, the, march, and, the, goals, that, each, of, the, leaders, aimed, at, the, 1963, march, on, washington, organizers, and, organizational, leaders, informally, named, the, big, six, were, a, philip, randolph, roy, wilkins, martin, luther, king, jr, whitney, young, james, farmer, and, john, lewis, although, they, came, from, different, backgrounds, and, political, interests, these, organizers, and, leaders, were, intent, on, the, peacefulness, of, the, march, which, had, its, own, marshal, to, ensure, that, the, event, would, be, peaceful, and, respectful, of, the, law, the, success, of, the, march, is, still, being, debated, but, one, aspect, which, has, been, raised, was, the, misrepresentation, of, women, a, lot, of, feminine, civil, rights, groups, had, participated, in, the, organization, of, the, march, but, when, it, came, to, actual, activity, women, were, denied, the, right, to, speak, and, were, relegated, to, figurative, roles, in, the, back, of, the, stage, as, some, female, participants, noticed, the, march, can, be, remembered, for, the, i, have, a, dream, speech, but, for, some, female, activists, it, was, a, new, awakening, forcing, black, women, not, only, to, fight, for, civil, rights, but, also, to, engage, in, the, feminist, movement, noted, achievements, of, the, civil, rights, movement, include, the, judicial, victory, in, the, brown, v, board, of, education, case, that, nullified, the, legal, article, of, separate, but, equal, and, made, segregation, legally, impermissible, and, the, passages, of, the, 1964, civil, rights, act, that, banned, discrimination, in, employment, practices, and, public, accommodations, passage, of, the, voting, rights, act, of, 1965, that, restored, voting, rights, and, passage, of, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1968, that, banned, discrimination, in, the, sale, or, rental, of, housing, by, 1967, the, emergence, of, the, black, power, movement, 1966, 75, began, to, gradually, eclipse, the, original, integrated, power, aims, of, the, successful, civil, rights, movement, that, had, been, espoused, by, martin, luther, king, jr, and, others, advocates, of, black, power, argued, for, black, self, determination, and, asserted, that, the, assimilation, inherent, in, integration, robs, africans, of, their, common, heritage, and, dignity, for, example, the, theorist, and, activist, omali, yeshitela, argues, that, africans, have, historically, fought, to, protect, their, lands, cultures, and, freedoms, from, european, colonialists, and, that, any, integration, into, the, society, which, has, stolen, another, people, and, their, wealth, is, an, act, of, treason, today, most, black, power, advocates, have, not, changed, their, self, sufficiency, argument, racism, still, exists, worldwide, and, some, believe, that, blacks, in, the, united, states, on, the, whole, did, not, assimilate, into, u, s, mainstream, culture, blacks, arguably, became, even, more, oppressed, this, time, partially, by, their, own, people, in, a, new, black, stratum, of, the, middle, class, and, the, ruling, class, black, power, s, advocates, generally, argue, that, the, reason, for, this, stalemate, and, further, oppression, of, the, vast, majority, of, u, s, blacks, is, because, black, power, s, objectives, have, not, had, the, opportunity, to, be, fully, carried, through, one, of, the, most, public, manifestations, of, the, black, power, movement, took, place, in, the, 1968, olympics, when, two, african, americans, tommie, smith, and, john, carlos, stood, on, the, podium, doing, a, black, power, salute, this, act, is, still, remembered, today, as, the, 1968, olympics, black, power, salute, the, chicano, movement, occurred, during, the, civil, rights, era, that, sought, political, empowerment, and, social, inclusion, for, mexican, americans, around, a, generally, nationalist, argument, the, chicano, movement, blossomed, in, the, 1960s, and, was, active, through, the, late, 1970s, in, various, regions, of, the, u, s, the, movement, had, roots, in, the, civil, rights, struggles, that, had, preceded, it, adding, to, it, the, cultural, and, generational, politics, of, the, era, the, early, heroes, of, the, movement, rodolfo, gonzales, in, denver, and, reies, tijerina, in, new, mexico, adopted, a, historical, account, of, the, preceding, hundred, and, twenty, five, years, that, had, obscured, much, of, mexican, american, history, gonzales, and, tijerina, embraced, a, nationalism, that, identified, the, failure, of, the, united, states, government, to, live, up, to, its, promises, in, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, in, that, account, mexican, americans, were, a, conquered, people, who, simply, needed, to, reclaim, their, birthright, and, cultural, heritage, as, part, of, a, new, nation, which, later, became, known, as, aztl, n, that, version, of, the, past, did, not, but, take, into, account, the, history, of, those, mexicans, who, had, immigrated, to, the, united, states, it, also, gave, little, attention, to, the, rights, of, undocumented, immigrants, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1960s, which, is, not, surprising, since, immigration, did, not, have, the, political, significance, it, later, acquired, it, was, a, decade, later, when, activists, such, as, bert, corona, in, california, embraced, the, rights, of, undocumented, workers, and, helped, broaden, the, movement, to, include, their, issues, when, the, movement, dealt, with, practical, problems, in, the, 1960s, most, activists, focused, on, the, most, immediate, issues, confronting, mexican, americans, unequal, educational, and, employment, opportunities, political, disfranchisement, and, police, brutality, in, the, heady, days, of, the, late, 1960s, when, the, student, movement, was, active, around, the, globe, the, chicano, movement, brought, about, more, or, less, spontaneous, actions, such, as, the, mass, walkouts, by, high, school, students, in, denver, and, east, los, angeles, in, 1968, and, the, chicano, moratorium, in, los, angeles, in, 1970, the, movement, was, particularly, strong, at, the, college, level, where, activists, formed, mecha, movimiento, estudiantil, chicano, de, aztl, n, which, promoted, chicano, studies, programs, and, a, generalized, ethno, nationalist, agenda, at, a, time, when, peaceful, sit, ins, were, a, common, protest, tactic, the, american, indian, movement, aim, takeovers, in, their, early, days, were, noticeably, violent, some, appeared, to, be, spontaneous, outcomes, of, protest, gatherings, but, others, included, armed, seizure, of, public, facilities, the, alcatraz, island, occupation, of, 1969, although, commonly, associated, with, nam, pre, dated, the, organization, but, was, a, catalyst, for, its, formation, in, 1970, aim, occupied, abandoned, property, at, the, naval, air, station, near, minneapolis, in, july, 1971, it, assisted, in, a, takeover, of, the, winter, dam, lac, courte, oreilles, and, wisconsin, when, activists, took, over, the, bureau, of, indian, affairs, headquarters, in, washington, d, c, in, november, 1972, they, sacked, the, building, and, 24, people, were, arrested, activists, occupied, the, custer, county, courthouse, in, 1973, though, police, routed, the, occupation, after, a, riot, took, place, in, 1973, activists, and, military, forces, confronted, each, other, in, the, wounded, knee, incident, the, standoff, lasted, 71, days, and, two, men, died, in, the, violence, if, the, period, associated, with, first, wave, feminism, focused, upon, absolute, rights, such, as, suffrage, which, led, to, women, attaining, the, right, to, vote, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, the, period, of, the, second, wave, feminism, was, concerned, with, the, issues, such, as, changing, social, attitudes, and, economic, reproductive, and, educational, equality, including, the, ability, to, have, careers, in, addition, to, motherhood, or, the, right, to, choose, not, to, have, children, between, the, genders, and, addressed, the, rights, of, female, minorities, the, new, feminist, movement, which, spanned, from, 1963, to, 1982, explored, economic, equality, political, power, at, all, levels, professional, equality, reproductive, freedoms, issues, with, the, family, educational, equality, sexuality, and, many, other, issues, since, the, mid, 19th, century, in, germany, social, reformers, have, used, the, language, of, civil, rights, to, argue, against, the, oppression, of, same, sex, sexuality, same, sex, emotional, intimacy, and, gender, variance, largely, but, not, exclusively, these, lgbt, movements, have, characterized, gender, variant, and, homosexually, oriented, people, as, a, minority, group, s, this, was, the, approach, taken, by, the, homophile, movement, of, the, 1940s, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, with, the, rise, of, secularism, in, the, west, an, increasing, sexual, openness, women, s,

building, community, and, unapologetic, activism, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, gay, liberation, the, words, gay, liberation, echoed, women, s, liberation, the, gay, liberation, front, consciously, took, its, name, from, the, national, liberation, fronts, of, vietnam, and, algeria, and, the, slogan, gay, power, as, a, defiant, answer, to, the, rights, oriented, homophile, movement,

of, gay, liberation, was, eclipsed, by, a, return, to, a, more, formal, movement, that, became, known, as, the, gay, and, lesbian, rights, movement, in, the, 1960s, the, early, years, of, the, brezhnev, stagnation, dissidents, in, the, soviet, union, increasingly, turned, their, attention, civil, and, eventually, human, rights, concerns, the, fight, for, civil, and, human, rights, focused, on, issues, of, freedom, of, expression, freedom, of, conscience, freedom, to, emigrate, punitive, psychiatry, and, the, plight, of, political, prisoners, it, was, characterized, by, a, new, openness, of, dissent, a, concern, for, legality, the, rejection, of, any, underground, and, violent, struggle, it, played, a, significant, role, in, providing, a, common, language, and, goal, for, many,
