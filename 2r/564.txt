the, russian, revolution, was, a, period, of, political, and, social, change, in, russia, starting, in, 1917, this, period, saw, russia, abolish, its, monarchy, and, adopt, a, socialist, form, of, government, following, two, successive, revolutions, and, a, civil, war, the, russian, revolution, can, also, be, seen, as, the, precursor, for, the, other, european, revolutions, that, occurred, during, or, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, such, as, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, the, russian, revolution, was, inaugurated, with, the, february, revolution, in, early, 1917, in, the, midst, of, world, war, i, with, the, german, empire, dealing, major, defeats, on, the, war, front, and, increasing, logistical, problems, in, the, rear, causing, shortages, of, bread, and, grain, the, russian, army, was, steadily, losing, morale, with, large, scale, mutiny, looming, high, officials, were, convinced, that, if, tsar, nicholas, ii, abdicated, the, unrest, would, subside, nicholas, agreed, and, stepped, down, ushering, in, a, new, provisional, government, led, by, the, russian, duma, the, parliament, during, the, civil, unrest, soviet, councils, were, formed, by, the, locals, in, petrograd, that, initially, did, not, oppose, the, new, provisional, government, however, the, soviets, did, insist, on, their, influence, in, the, government, and, control, over, various, militias, by, march, russia, had, two, rival, governments, the, provisional, government, held, state, power, in, military, and, international, affairs, whereas, the, network, of, soviets, held, more, power, concerning, domestic, affairs, critically, the, soviets, held, the, allegiance, of, the, working, class, as, well, as, the, growing, urban, middle, class, during, this, chaotic, period, there, were, frequent, mutinies, protests, and, strikes, many, socialist, and, other, leftist, political, organizations, were, struggling, for, influence, within, the, provisional, government, and, the, soviets, notable, factions, included, the, social, democrats, or, mensheviks, social, revolutionaries, and, anarchists, as, well, as, the, bolsheviks, a, far, left, party, led, by, vladimir, lenin, initially, the, bolsheviks, were, a, marginal, faction, however, they, won, popularity, with, their, program, promising, peace, land, and, bread, cease, war, with, germany, give, land, to, the, peasantry, and, end, the, wartime, famine, despite, the, virtually, universal, hatred, of, the, war, the, provisional, government, chose, to, continue, fighting, to, support, its, allies, giving, the, bolsheviks, and, other, socialist, factions, a, justification, to, advance, the, revolution, further, the, bolsheviks, merged, various, workers, militias, loyal, to, them, into, the, red, guards, which, would, be, strong, enough, to, seize, power, the, volatile, situation, reached, its, climax, with, the, october, revolution, a, bolshevik, armed, insurrection, by, workers, and, soldiers, in, petrograd, that, overthrew, the, provisional, government, transferring, all, its, authority, to, the, bolsheviks, the, bolsheviks, acting, in, the, framework, of, the, soviet, councils, established, their, own, government, and, later, proclaimed, the, establishment, of, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, rsfsr, under, pressure, from, german, military, offensives, the, bolsheviks, soon, relocated, the, national, capital, to, moscow, the, rsfsr, began, the, process, of, reorganizing, the, former, empire, into, the, world, s, first, socialist, state, to, practice, soviet, democracy, on, a, national, and, international, scale, their, promise, to, end, russia, s, participation, in, the, first, world, war, was, fulfilled, when, the, bolshevik, leaders, signed, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, with, germany, in, march, 1918, to, secure, the, new, state, the, bolsheviks, established, the, cheka, a, secret, police, and, revolutionary, security, service, working, to, uncover, punish, and, eliminate, those, considered, to, be, enemies, of, the, people, in, campaigns, called, the, red, terror, consciously, modeled, on, those, of, the, french, revolution, although, the, bolsheviks, held, large, support, in, urban, areas, they, had, many, foreign, and, domestic, enemies, that, refused, to, recognize, their, government, russia, erupted, into, a, bloody, civil, war, which, pitted, the, reds, bolsheviks, against, their, enemies, collectively, referred, to, as, the, white, army, the, white, army, comprised, independence, movements, monarchists, liberals, and, anti, bolshevik, socialist, parties, in, response, the, bolshevik, commissar, leon, trotsky, began, organizing, workers, militias, loyal, to, the, bolsheviks, into, the, red, army, while, key, events, occurred, in, moscow, and, petrograd, every, city, in, the, empire, was, convulsed, including, the, provinces, of, national, minorities, and, in, the, rural, areas, peasants, took, over, and, redistributed, land, as, the, war, progressed, the, rsfsr, began, to, establish, soviet, power, in, the, newly, independent, republics, that, seceded, from, the, russian, empire, the, rsfsr, initially, focused, its, efforts, on, the, newly, independent, republics, of, armenia, azerbaijan, belarus, georgia, and, ukraine, wartime, cohesion, and, intervention, from, foreign, powers, prompted, the, rsfsr, to, begin, unifying, these, nations, under, one, flag, and, created, the, union, of, soviet, socialist, republics, ussr, historians, generally, consider, the, end, of, the, revolutionary, period, to, be, in, 1923, when, the, russian, civil, war, concluded, with, the, defeat, of, the, white, army, and, all, rival, socialist, factions, leading, to, mass, emigration, from, russia, the, victorious, bolshevik, party, reconstituted, itself, into, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, and, would, remain, in, power, for, the, next, 68, years, the, russian, revolution, of, 1905, was, a, major, factor, contributing, to, the, cause, of, the, revolutions, of, 1917, the, events, of, bloody, sunday, triggered, nationwide, protests, and, soldier, mutinies, a, council, of, workers, called, the, st, petersburg, soviet, was, created, in, this, chaos, while, the, 1905, revolution, was, ultimately, crushed, and, the, leaders, of, the, st, petersburg, soviet, were, arrested, this, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, later, petrograd, soviet, and, other, revolutionary, movements, during, the, leadup, to, 1917, the, 1905, revolution, also, led, to, the, creation, of, a, duma, parliament, that, would, later, form, the, provisional, government, following, february, 1917, russia, s, poor, performance, in, 1914, 1915, prompted, growing, complaints, directed, at, tsar, nicholas, ii, and, the, romanov, family, a, short, wave, of, patriotic, nationalism, ended, in, the, face, of, defeats, and, poor, conditions, on, the, eastern, front, of, world, war, i, the, tsar, made, the, situation, worse, by, taking, personal, control, of, the, imperial, russian, army, in, 1915, a, challenge, far, beyond, his, skills, he, was, now, held, personally, responsible, for, russia, s, continuing, defeats, and, losses, in, addition, tsarina, alexandra, left, to, rule, while, the, tsar, commanded, at, the, front, was, german, born, leading, to, suspicion, of, collusion, only, to, be, exacerbated, by, rumors, relating, to, her, relationship, with, the, controversial, mystic, grigori, rasputin, rasputin, s, influence, led, to, disastrous, ministerial, appointments, and, corruption, resulting, in, a, worsening, of, conditions, within, russia, after, the, entry, of, the, ottoman, empire, on, the, side, of, the, central, powers, in, october, 1914, russia, was, deprived, of, a, major, trade, route, to, the, mediterranean, sea, which, worsened, the, economic, crisis, and, the, munitions, shortages, meanwhile, germany, was, able, to, produce, great, amounts, of, munitions, whilst, constantly, fighting, on, two, major, battlefronts, the, conditions, during, the, war, resulted, in, a, devastating, loss, of, morale, within, the, russian, army, and, the, general, population, of, russia, itself, this, was, particularly, apparent, in, the, cities, owing, to, a, lack, of, food, in, response, to, the, disruption, of, agriculture, food, scarcity, had, become, a, considerable, problem, in, russia, but, the, cause, of, this, did, not, lie, in, any, failure, of, the, harvests, which, had, not, been, significantly, altered, during, wartime, the, indirect, reason, was, that, the, government, in, order, to, finance, the, war, printed, millions, of, rouble, notes, and, by, 1917, inflation, had, made, prices, increase, up, to, four, times, what, they, had, been, in, 1914, farmers, were, consequently, faced, with, a, higher, cost, of, living, but, with, little, increase, in, income, as, a, result, they, tended, to, hoard, their, grain, and, to, revert, to, subsistence, farming, thus, the, cities, were, constantly, short, of, food, at, the, same, time, rising, prices, led, to, demands, for, higher, wages, in, the, factories, and, in, january, and, february, 1916, revolutionary, propaganda, in, part, aided, by, german, funds, led, to, widespread, strikes, this, resulted, in, growing, criticism, of, the, government, including, an, increased, participation, of, workers, in, revolutionary, parties, liberal, parties, too, had, an, increased, platform, to, voice, their, complaints, as, the, initial, fervor, of, the, war, resulted, in, the, tsarist, government, creating, a, variety, of, political, organizations, in, july, 1915, a, central, war, industries, committee, was, established, under, the, chairmanship, of, a, prominent, octobrist, alexander, guchkov, 1862, 1936, including, ten, workers, representatives, the, petrograd, mensheviks, agreed, to, join, despite, the, objections, of, their, leaders, abroad, all, this, activity, gave, renewed, encouragement, to, political, ambitions, and, in, september, 1915, a, combination, of, octobrists, and, kadets, in, the, duma, demanded, the, forming, of, a, responsible, government, which, the, tsar, rejected, all, these, factors, had, given, rise, to, a, sharp, loss, of, confidence, in, the, regime, even, within, the, ruling, class, growing, throughout, the, war, early, in, 1916, guchkov, discussed, with, senior, army, officers, and, members, of, the, central, war, industries, committee, about, a, possible, coup, to, force, the, abdication, of, the, tsar, in, december, a, small, group, of, nobles, assassinated, rasputin, and, in, january, 1917, the, tsar, s, cousin, grand, duke, nicholas, was, asked, indirectly, by, prince, lvov, whether, he, would, be, prepared, to, take, over, the, throne, from, his, nephew, tsar, nicholas, ii, none, of, these, incidents, were, in, themselves, the, immediate, cause, of, the, february, revolution, but, they, do, help, to, explain, why, the, monarchy, survived, only, a, few, days, after, it, had, broken, out, meanwhile, socialist, revolutionary, leaders, in, exile, many, of, them, living, in, switzerland, had, been, the, glum, spectators, of, the, collapse, of, international, socialist, solidarity, french, and, german, social, democrats, had, voted, in, favour, of, their, respective, governments, war, efforts, georgi, plekhanov, in, paris, had, adopted, a, violently, anti, german, stand, while, alexander, parvus, supported, the, german, war, effort, as, the, best, means, of, ensuring, a, revolution, in, russia, the, mensheviks, largely, maintained, that, russia, had, the, right, to, defend, herself, against, germany, although, julius, martov, a, prominent, menshevik, now, on, the, left, of, his, group, demanded, an, end, to, the, war, and, a, settlement, on, the, basis, of, national, self, determination, with, no, annexations, or, indemnities, it, was, these, views, of, martov, that, predominated, in, a, manifesto, drawn, up, by, leon, trotsky, at, the, time, a, menshevik, at, a, conference, in, zimmerwald, attended, by, 35, socialist, leaders, in, september, 1915, inevitably, vladimir, lenin, supported, by, zinoviev, and, radek, strongly, contested, them, their, attitudes, became, known, as, the, zimmerwald, left, lenin, rejected, both, the, defence, of, russia, and, the, cry, for, peace, since, the, autumn, of, 1914, he, had, insisted, that, from, the, standpoint, of, the, working, class, and, of, the, labouring, masses, the, lesser, evil, would, be, the, defeat, of, the, tsarist, monarchy, the, war, must, be, turned, into, a, civil, war, of, the, proletarian, soldiers, against, their, own, governments, and, if, a, proletarian, victory, should, emerge, from, this, in, russia, then, their, duty, would, be, to, wage, a, revolutionary, war, for, the, liberation, of, the, masses, throughout, europe, an, elementary, theory, of, property, believed, by, many, peasants, was, that, land, should, belong, to, those, who, work, on, it, at, the, same, time, peasant, life, and, culture, was, changing, constantly, change, was, facilitated, by, the, physical, movement, of, growing, numbers, of, peasant, villagers, who, migrated, to, and, from, industrial, and, urban, environments, but, also, by, the, introduction, of, city, culture, into, the, village, through, material, goods, the, press, and, word, of, mouth, workers, also, had, good, reasons, for, discontent, overcrowded, housing, with, often, deplorable, sanitary, conditions, long, hours, at, work, on, the, eve, of, the, war, a, 10, hour, workday, six, days, a, week, was, the, average, and, many, were, working, 11, 12, hours, a, day, by, 1916, constant, risk, of, injury, and, death, from, poor, safety, and, sanitary, conditions, harsh, discipline, not, only, rules, and, fines, but, foremen, s, fists, and, inadequate, wages, made, worse, after, 1914, by, steep, wartime, increases, in, the, cost, of, living, at, the, same, time, urban, industrial, life, had, its, benefits, though, these, could, be, just, as, dangerous, in, terms, of, social, and, political, stability, as, the, hardships, there, were, many, encouragements, to, expect, more, from, life, acquiring, new, skills, gave, many, workers, a, sense, of, self, respect, and, confidence, heightening, expectations, and, desires, living, in, cities, workers, encountered, material, goods, they, had, never, seen, in, villages, most, importantly, workers, living, in, cities, were, exposed, to, new, ideas, about, the, social, and, political, order, the, social, causes, of, the, russian, revolution, can, be, derived, from, centuries, of, oppression, of, the, lower, classes, by, the, tsarist, regime, and, nicholas, s, failures, in, world, war, i, while, rural, agrarian, peasants, had, been, emancipated, from, serfdom, in, 1861, they, still, resented, paying, redemption, payments, to, the, state, and, demanded, communal, tender, of, the, land, they, worked, the, problem, was, further, compounded, by, the, failure, of, sergei, witte, s, land, reforms, of, the, early, 20th, century, increasing, peasant, disturbances, and, sometimes, actual, revolts, occurred, with, the, goal, of, securing, ownership, of, the, land, they, worked, russia, consisted, mainly, of, poor, farming, peasants, and, substantial, inequality, of, land, ownership, with, 1, 5, of, the, population, owning, 25, of, the, land, the, rapid, industrialization, of, russia, also, resulted, in, urban, overcrowding, and, poor, conditions, for, urban, industrial, workers, as, mentioned, above, between, 1890, and, 1910, the, population, of, the, capital, saint, petersburg, nearly, doubled, from, 1, 033, 600, to, 1, 905, 600, with, moscow, experiencing, similar, growth, this, created, a, new, proletariat, which, due, to, being, crowded, together, in, the, cities, was, much, more, likely, to, protest, and, go, on, strike, than, the, peasantry, had, been, in, previous, times, one, 1904, survey, found, that, an, average, of, 16, people, shared, each, apartment, in, saint, petersburg, with, six, people, per, room, there, was, also, no, running, water, and, piles, of, human, waste, were, a, threat, to, the, health, of, the, workers, the, poor, conditions, only, aggravated, the, situation, with, the, number, of, strikes, and, incidents, of, public, disorder, rapidly, increasing, in, the, years, shortly, before, world, war, i, because, of, late, industrialization, russia, s, workers, were, highly, concentrated, by, 1914, 40, of, russian, workers, were, employed, in, factories, of, 1, 000, workers, 32, in, 1901, 42, worked, in, 100, 1, 000, worker, enterprises, 18, in, 1, 100, worker, businesses, in, the, us, 1914, the, figures, were, 18, 47, and, 35, respectively, world, war, i, added, to, the, chaos, conscription, across, russia, resulted, in, unwilling, citizens, being, sent, off, to, war, the, vast, demand, for, factory, production, of, war, supplies, and, workers, resulted, in, many, more, labor, riots, and, strikes, conscription, stripped, skilled, workers, from, the, cities, who, had, to, be, replaced, with, unskilled, peasants, when, famine, began, to, hit, due, to, the, poor, railway, system, workers, abandoned, the, cities, in, droves, seeking, food, finally, the, soldiers, themselves, who, suffered, from, a, lack, of, equipment, and, protection, from, the, elements, began, to, turn, against, the, tsar, this, was, mainly, because, as, the, war, progressed, many, of, the, officers, who, were, loyal, to, the, tsar, were, killed, being, replaced, by, discontented, conscripts, from, the, major, cities, who, had, little, loyalty, to, the, tsar, many, sections, of, the, country, had, reason, to, be, dissatisfied, with, the, existing, autocracy, nicholas, ii, was, a, deeply, conservative, ruler, and, maintained, a, strict, authoritarian, system, individuals, and, society, in, general, were, expected, to, show, self, restraint, devotion, to, community, deference, to, the, social, hierarchy, and, a, sense, of, duty, to, the, country, religious, faith, helped, bind, all, of, these, tenets, together, as, a, source, of, comfort, and, reassurance, in, the, face, of, difficult, conditions, and, as, a, means, of, political, authority, exercised, through, the, clergy, perhaps, more, than, any, other, modern, monarch, nicholas, ii, attached, his, fate, and, the, future, of, his, dynasty, to, the, notion, of, the, ruler, as, a, saintly, and, infallible, father, to, his, people, this, vision, of, the, romanov, monarchy, left, him, unaware, of, the, state, of, his, country, with, a, firm, belief, that, his, power, to, rule, was, granted, by, divine, right, nicholas, assumed, that, the, russian, people, were, devoted, to, him, with, unquestioning, loyalty, this, ironclad, belief, rendered, nicholas, unwilling, to, allow, the, progressive, reforms, that, might, have, alleviated, the, suffering, of, the, russian, people, even, after, the, 1905, revolution, spurred, the, tsar, to, decree, limited, civil, rights, and, democratic, representation, he, worked, to, limit, even, these, liberties, in, order, to, preserve, the, ultimate, authority, of, the, crown, despite, constant, oppression, the, desire, of, the, people, for, democratic, participation, in, government, decisions, was, strong, since, the, age, of, enlightenment, russian, intellectuals, had, promoted, enlightenment, ideals, such, as, the, dignity, of, the, individual, and, the, rectitude, of, democratic, representation, these, ideals, were, championed, most, vociferously, by, russia, s, liberals, although, populists, marxists, and, anarchists, also, claimed, to, support, democratic, reforms, a, growing, opposition, movement, had, begun, to, challenge, the, romanov, monarchy, openly, well, before, the, turmoil, of, world, war, i, dissatisfaction, with, russian, autocracy, culminated, in, the, huge, national, upheaval, that, followed, the, bloody, sunday, massacre, of, january, 1905, in, which, hundreds, of, unarmed, protesters, were, shot, by, the, tsar, s, troops, workers, responded, to, the, massacre, with, a, crippling, general, strike, forcing, nicholas, to, put, forth, the, october, manifesto, which, established, a, democratically, elected, parliament, the, state, duma, although, the, tsar, accepted, the, 1906, fundamental, state, laws, one, year, later, he, subsequently, dismissed, the, first, two, dumas, when, they, proved, uncooperative, unfulfilled, hopes, of, democracy, fueled, revolutionary, ideas, and, violent, outbursts, targeted, at, the, monarchy, one, of, the, tsar, s, principal, rationales, for, risking, war, in, 1914, was, his, desire, to, restore, the, prestige, that, russia, had, lost, amid, the, debacles, of, the, russo, japanese, war, 1904, 1905, nicholas, also, sought, to, foster, a, greater, sense, of, national, unity, with, a, war, against, a, common, and, old, enemy, the, russian, empire, was, an, agglomeration, of, diverse, ethnicities, that, had, demonstrated, significant, signs, of, disunity, in, the, years, before, the, first, world, war, nicholas, believed, in, part, that, the, shared, peril, and, tribulation, of, a, foreign, war, would, mitigate, the, social, unrest, over, the, persistent, issues, of, poverty, inequality, and, inhumane, working, conditions, instead, of, restoring, russia, s, political, and, military, standing, world, war, i, led, to, the, slaughter, of, russian, troops, and, military, defeats, that, undermined, both, the, monarchy, and, russian, society, to, the, point, of, collapse, the, outbreak, of, war, in, august, 1914, initially, served, to, quiet, the, prevalent, social, and, political, protests, focusing, hostilities, against, a, common, external, enemy, but, this, patriotic, unity, did, not, last, long, as, the, war, dragged, on, inconclusively, war, weariness, gradually, took, its, toll, although, many, ordinary, russians, joined, anti, german, demonstrations, in, the, first, few, weeks, of, the, war, hostility, toward, the, kaiser, and, the, desire, to, defend, their, land, and, their, lives, did, not, necessarily, translate, into, enthusiasm, for, the, tsar, or, the, government, russia, s, first, major, battle, of, the, war, was, a, disaster, in, the, 1914, battle, of, tannenberg, over, 30, 000, russian, troops, were, killed, or, wounded, and, 90, 000, captured, while, germany, suffered, just, 12, 000, casualties, however, austro, hungarian, forces, allied, to, germany, were, driven, back, deep, into, the, galicia, region, by, the, end, of, the, year, in, the, autumn, of, 1915, nicholas, had, taken, direct, command, of, the, army, personally, overseeing, russia, s, main, theatre, of, war, and, leaving, his, ambitious, but, incapable, wife, alexandra, in, charge, of, the, government, reports, of, corruption, and, incompetence, in, the, imperial, government, began, to, emerge, and, the, growing, influence, of, grigori, rasputin, in, the, imperial, family, was, widely, resented, in, 1915, things, took, a, critical, turn, for, the, worse, when, germany, shifted, its, focus, of, attack, to, the, eastern, front, the, superior, german, army, better, led, better, trained, and, better, supplied, was, quite, effective, against, the, ill, equipped, russian, forces, driving, the, russians, out, of, galicia, as, well, as, russian, poland, during, the, gorlice, tarn, w, offensive, campaign, by, the, end, of, october, 1916, russia, had, lost, between, 1, 600, 000, and, 1, 800, 000, soldiers, with, an, additional, 2, 000, 000, prisoners, of, war, and, 1, 000, 000, missing, all, making, up, a, total, of, nearly, 5, 000, 000, men, these, staggering, losses, played, a, definite, role, in, the, mutinies, and, revolts, that, began, to, occur, in, 1916, reports, of, fraternizing, with, the, enemy, began, to, circulate, soldiers, went, hungry, lacked, shoes, munitions, and, even, weapons, rampant, discontent, lowered, morale, which, was, further, undermined, by, a, series, of, military, defeats, casualty, rates, were, the, most, vivid, sign, of, this, disaster, by, the, end, of, 1914, only, five, months, into, the, war, around, 390, 000, russian, men, had, lost, their, lives, and, nearly, 1, 000, 000, were, injured, far, sooner, than, expected, inadequately, trained, recruits, were, called, for, active, duty, a, process, repeated, throughout, the, war, as, staggering, losses, continued, to, mount, the, officer, class, also, saw, remarkable, changes, especially, within, the, lower, echelons, which, were, quickly, filled, with, soldiers, rising, up, through, the, ranks, these, men, usually, of, peasant, or, working, class, backgrounds, were, to, play, a, large, role, in, the, politicization, of, the, troops, in, 1917, the, army, quickly, ran, short, of, rifles, and, ammunition, as, well, as, uniforms, and, food, and, by, mid, 1915, men, were, being, sent, to, the, front, bearing, no, arms, it, was, hoped, that, they, could, equip, themselves, with, arms, recovered, from, fallen, soldiers, of, both, sides, on, the, battlefields, the, soldiers, did, not, feel, as, if, they, were, valuable, rather, they, felt, as, if, they, were, expendable, by, the, spring, of, 1915, the, army, was, in, steady, retreat, which, was, not, always, orderly, desertion, plundering, and, chaotic, flight, were, not, uncommon, by, 1916, however, the, situation, had, improved, in, many, respects, russian, troops, stopped, retreating, and, there, were, even, some, modest, successes, in, the, offensives, that, were, staged, that, year, albeit, at, great, loss, of, life, also, the, problem, of, shortages, was, largely, solved, by, a, major, effort, to, increase, domestic, production, nevertheless, by, the, end, of, 1916, morale, among, soldiers, was, even, worse, than, it, had, been, during, the, great, retreat, of, 1915, the, fortunes, of, war, may, have, improved, but, the, fact, of, war, remained, which, continually, took, russian, lives, the, crisis, in, morale, as, was, argued, by, allan, wildman, a, leading, historian, of, the, russian, army, in, war, and, revolution, was, rooted, fundamentally, in, the, feeling, of, utter, despair, that, the, slaughter, would, ever, end, and, that, anything, resembling, victory, could, be, achieved, the, war, did, not, only, devastate, soldiers, by, the, end, of, 1915, there, were, manifold, signs, that, the, economy, was, breaking, down, under, the, heightened, strain, of, wartime, demand, the, main, problems, were, food, shortages, and, rising, prices, inflation, dragged, incomes, down, at, an, alarmingly, rapid, rate, and, shortages, made, it, difficult, for, an, individual, to, sustain, oneself, these, shortages, were, a, problem, especially, in, the, capital, st, petersburg, where, distance, from, supplies, and, poor, transportation, networks, made, matters, particularly, worse, shops, closed, early, or, entirely, for, lack, of, bread, sugar, meat, and, other, provisions, and, lines, lengthened, massively, for, what, remained, conditions, became, increasingly, difficult, to, afford, food, and, physically, obtain, it, strikes, increased, steadily, from, the, middle, of, 1915, and, so, did, crime, but, for, the, most, part, people, suffered, and, endured, scouring, the, city, for, food, working, class, women, in, st, petersburg, reportedly, spent, about, forty, hours, a, week, in, food, lines, begging, turning, to, prostitution, or, crime, tearing, down, wooden, fences, to, keep, stoves, heated, for, warmth, and, continued, to, resent, the, rich, government, officials, responsible, for, public, order, worried, about, how, long, people, s, patience, would, last, a, report, by, the, st, petersburg, branch, of, the, security, police, the, okhrana, in, october, 1916, warned, bluntly, of, the, possibility, in, the, near, future, of, riots, by, the, lower, classes, of, the, empire, enraged, by, the, burdens, of, daily, existence, tsar, nicholas, was, blamed, for, all, of, these, crises, and, what, little, support, he, had, left, began, to, crumble, as, discontent, grew, the, state, duma, issued, a, warning, to, nicholas, in, november, 1916, stating, that, inevitably, a, terrible, disaster, would, grip, the, country, unless, a, constitutional, form, of, government, was, put, in, place, nicholas, ignored, these, warnings, and, russia, s, tsarist, regime, collapsed, a, few, months, later, during, the, february, revolution, of, 1917, one, year, later, the, tsar, and, his, entire, family, were, executed, at, the, beginning, of, february, petrograd, workers, began, several, strikes, and, demonstrations, on, 7, march, putilov, petrograd, s, largest, industrial, plant, was, closed, by, a, workers, strike, the, next, day, a, series, of, meetings, and, rallies, were, held, for, international, women, s, day, which, gradually, turned, into, economic, and, political, gatherings, demonstrations, were, organised, to, demand, bread, and, these, were, supported, by, the, industrial, working, force, who, considered, them, a, reason, for, continuing, the, strikes, the, women, workers, marched, to, nearby, factories, bringing, out, over, 50, 000, workers, on, strike, by, 10, march, virtually, every, industrial, enterprise, in, petrograd, had, been, shut, down, together, with, many, commercial, and, service, enterprises, students, white, collar, workers, and, teachers, joined, the, workers, in, the, streets, and, at, public, meetings, to, quell, the, riots, the, tsar, looked, to, the, army, at, least, 180, 000, troops, were, available, in, the, capital, but, most, were, either, untrained, or, injured, historian, ian, beckett, suggests, around, 12, 000, could, be, regarded, as, reliable, but, even, these, proved, reluctant, to, move, in, on, the, crowd, since, it, included, so, many, women, it, was, for, this, reason, that, on, 11, march, when, the, tsar, ordered, the, army, to, suppress, the, rioting, by, force, troops, began, to, revolt, although, few, actively, joined, the, rioting, many, officers, were, either, shot, or, went, into, hiding, the, ability, of, the, garrison, to, hold, back, the, protests, was, all, but, nullified, symbols, of, the, tsarist, regime, were, rapidly, torn, down, around, the, city, and, governmental, authority, in, the, capital, collapsed, not, helped, by, the, fact, that, nicholas, had, prorogued, the, duma, that, morning, leaving, it, with, no, legal, authority, to, act, the, response, of, the, duma, urged, on, by, the, liberal, bloc, was, to, establish, a, temporary, committee, to, restore, law, and, order, meanwhile, the, socialist, parties, established, the, petrograd, soviet, to, represent, workers, and, soldiers, the, remaining, loyal, units, switched, allegiance, the, next, day, the, tsar, directed, the, royal, train, back, towards, petrograd, which, was, stopped, on, 14, march, by, a, group, of, revolutionaries, at, malaya, vishera, when, the, tsar, finally, arrived, at, pskov, the, army, chief, nikolai, ruzsky, and, the, duma, deputies, alexander, guchkov, and, vasily, shulgin, suggested, in, unison, that, he, abdicate, the, throne, he, did, so, on, 15, march, on, behalf, of, himself, and, then, having, taken, advice, on, behalf, of, his, son, the, tsarevich, nicholas, nominated, his, brother, the, grand, duke, michael, alexandrovich, to, succeed, him, but, the, grand, duke, realised, that, he, would, have, little, support, as, ruler, so, he, declined, the, crown, on, 16, march, stating, that, he, would, take, it, only, if, that, was, the, consensus, of, democratic, action, six, days, later, nicholas, no, longer, tsar, and, addressed, with, contempt, by, the, sentries, as, nicholas, romanov, was, reunited, with, his, family, at, the, alexander, palace, at, tsarskoye, selo, he, was, placed, under, house, arrest, with, his, family, by, the, provisional, government, the, immediate, effect, of, the, february, revolution, was, a, widespread, atmosphere, of, elation, and, excitement, in, petrograd, on, 16, march, a, provisional, government, was, announced, the, center, left, was, well, represented, and, the, government, was, initially, chaired, by, a, liberal, aristocrat, prince, georgy, yevgenievich, lvov, a, member, of, the, constitutional, democratic, party, kd, the, socialists, had, formed, their, rival, body, the, petrograd, soviet, or, workers, council, four, days, earlier, the, petrograd, soviet, and, the, provisional, government, competed, for, power, over, russia, the, effective, power, of, the, provisional, government, was, challenged, by, the, authority, of, an, institution, that, claimed, to, represent, the, will, of, workers, and, soldiers, and, could, in, fact, mobilize, and, control, these, groups, during, the, early, months, of, the, revolution, the, petrograd, soviet, council, of, workers, deputies, the, model, for, the, soviets, were, workers, councils, that, had, been, established, in, scores, of, russian, cities, during, the, 1905, revolution, in, february, 1917, striking, workers, elected, deputies, to, represent, them, and, socialist, activists, began, organizing, a, citywide, council, to, unite, these, deputies, with, representatives, of, the, socialist, parties, on, 27, february, socialist, duma, deputies, mainly, mensheviks, and, socialist, revolutionaries, took, the, lead, in, organizing, a, citywide, council, the, petrograd, soviet, met, in, the, tauride, palace, room, 13, permitted, by, the, provisional, government, the, leaders, of, the, petrograd, soviet, believed, that, they, represented, particular, classes, of, the, population, not, the, whole, nation, they, also, believed, russia, was, not, ready, for, socialism, they, viewed, their, role, as, limited, to, pressuring, hesitant, bourgeoisie, to, rule, and, to, introduce, extensive, democratic, reforms, in, russia, the, replacement, of, the, monarchy, by, a, republic, guaranteed, civil, rights, a, democratic, police, and, army, abolition, of, religious, and, ethnic, discrimination, preparation, of, elections, to, a, constituent, assembly, and, so, on, they, met, in, the, same, building, as, the, emerging, provisional, government, not, to, compete, with, the, duma, committee, for, state, power, but, to, best, exert, pressure, on, the, new, government, to, act, in, other, words, as, a, popular, democratic, lobby, the, relationship, between, these, two, major, powers, was, complex, from, the, beginning, and, would, shape, the, politics, of, 1917, the, representatives, of, the, provisional, government, agreed, to, take, into, account, the, opinions, of, the, soviet, of, workers, deputies, though, they, were, also, determined, to, prevent, interference, which, would, create, an, unacceptable, situation, of, dual, power, in, fact, this, was, precisely, what, was, being, created, though, this, dual, power, dvoyevlastiye, was, the, result, less, of, the, actions, or, attitudes, of, the, leaders, of, these, two, institutions, than, of, actions, outside, their, control, especially, the, ongoing, social, movement, taking, place, on, the, streets, of, russia, s, cities, factories, shops, barracks, villages, and, in, the, trenches, a, series, of, political, crises, see, the, chronology, below, in, the, relationship, between, population, and, government, and, between, the, provisional, government, and, the, soviets, which, developed, into, a, nationwide, movement, with, a, national, leadership, the, all, russian, central, executive, committee, of, soviets, vtsik, undermined, the, authority, of, the, provisional, government, but, also, of, the, moderate, socialist, leaders, of, the, soviets, although, the, soviet, leadership, initially, refused, to, participate, in, the, bourgeois, provisional, government, alexander, kerensky, a, young, popular, lawyer, and, a, member, of, the, socialist, revolutionary, party, srp, agreed, to, join, the, new, cabinet, and, became, an, increasingly, central, figure, in, the, government, eventually, taking, leadership, of, the, provisional, government, as, minister, of, war, and, later, prime, minister, kerensky, promoted, freedom, of, speech, released, thousands, of, political, prisoners, continued, the, war, effort, even, organizing, another, offensive, which, however, was, no, more, successful, than, its, predecessors, nevertheless, kerensky, still, faced, several, great, challenges, highlighted, by, the, soldiers, urban, workers, and, peasants, who, claimed, that, they, had, gained, nothing, by, the, revolution, the, political, group, that, proved, most, troublesome, for, kerensky, and, would, eventually, overthrow, him, was, the, bolshevik, party, led, by, vladimir, lenin, lenin, had, been, living, in, exile, in, neutral, switzerland, and, due, to, democratization, of, politics, after, the, february, revolution, which, legalized, formerly, banned, political, parties, he, perceived, the, opportunity, for, his, marxist, revolution, although, return, to, russia, had, become, a, possibility, the, war, made, it, logistically, difficult, eventually, german, officials, arranged, for, lenin, to, pass, through, their, territory, hoping, that, his, activities, would, weaken, russia, or, even, if, the, bolsheviks, came, to, power, lead, to, russia, s, withdrawal, from, the, war, lenin, and, his, associates, however, had, to, agree, to, travel, to, russia, in, a, sealed, train, germany, would, not, take, the, chance, that, he, would, foment, revolution, in, germany, after, passing, through, the, front, he, arrived, in, petrograd, in, april, 1917, on, the, way, to, russia, lenin, prepared, the, april, theses, which, outlined, central, bolshevik, policies, these, included, that, the, soviets, take, power, as, seen, in, the, slogan, all, power, to, the, soviets, and, denouncing, the, liberals, and, social, revolutionaries, in, the, provisional, government, forbidding, co, operation, with, it, many, bolsheviks, however, had, supported, the, provisional, government, including, lev, kamenev, with, lenin, s, arrival, the, popularity, of, the, bolsheviks, increased, steadily, over, the, course, of, the, spring, public, dissatisfaction, with, the, provisional, government, and, the, war, in, particular, among, workers, soldiers, and, peasants, pushed, these, groups, to, radical, parties, despite, growing, support, for, the, bolsheviks, buoyed, by, maxims, that, called, most, famously, for, all, power, to, the, soviets, the, party, held, very, little, real, power, in, the, moderate, dominated, petrograd, soviet, in, fact, historians, such, as, sheila, fitzpatrick, have, asserted, that, lenin, s, exhortations, for, the, soviet, council, to, take, power, were, intended, to, arouse, indignation, both, with, the, provisional, government, whose, policies, were, viewed, as, conservative, and, the, soviets, themselves, which, were, viewed, as, subservients, to, the, conservative, government, by, some, other, historians, accounts, lenin, and, his, followers, were, unprepared, for, how, their, groundswell, of, support, especially, among, influential, worker, and, soldier, groups, would, translate, into, real, power, in, the, summer, of, 1917, on, 18, june, the, provisional, government, launched, an, attack, against, germany, that, failed, miserably, soon, after, the, government, ordered, soldiers, to, go, to, the, front, reneging, on, a, promise, the, soldiers, refused, to, follow, the, new, orders, the, arrival, of, radical, kronstadt, sailors, who, had, tried, and, executed, many, officers, including, one, admiral, further, fueled, the, growing, revolutionary, atmosphere, sailors, and, soldiers, along, with, petrograd, workers, took, to, the, streets, in, violent, protest, calling, for, all, power, to, the, soviets, the, revolt, however, was, disowned, by, lenin, and, the, bolshevik, leaders, and, dissipated, within, a, few, days, in, the, aftermath, lenin, fled, to, finland, under, threat, of, arrest, while, trotsky, among, other, prominent, bolsheviks, was, arrested, the, july, days, confirmed, the, popularity, of, the, anti, war, radical, bolsheviks, but, their, unpreparedness, at, the, moment, of, revolt, was, an, embarrassing, gaffe, that, lost, them, support, among, their, main, constituent, groups, soldiers, and, workers, the, bolshevik, failure, in, the, july, days, proved, temporary, the, bolsheviks, had, undergone, a, spectacular, growth, in, membership, whereas, in, february, 1917, the, bolsheviks, were, limited, to, only, 24, 000, members, by, september, 1917, there, were, 200, 000, members, of, the, bolshevik, faction, previously, the, bolsheviks, had, been, in, the, minority, in, the, two, leading, cities, of, russia, st, petersburg, and, moscow, behind, the, mensheviks, and, the, socialist, revolutionaries, by, september, the, bolsheviks, were, in, the, majority, in, both, cities, furthermore, the, bolshevik, controlled, moscow, regional, bureau, of, the, party, also, controlled, the, party, organizations, of, the, 13, provinces, around, moscow, these, 13, provinces, held, 37, of, russia, s, population, and, 20, of, the, membership, of, the, bolshevik, faction, in, august, poor, and, misleading, communication, led, general, lavr, kornilov, the, recently, appointed, supreme, commander, of, russian, military, forces, to, believe, that, the, petrograd, government, had, already, been, captured, by, radicals, or, was, in, serious, danger, thereof, in, response, he, ordered, troops, to, petrograd, to, pacify, the, city, to, secure, his, position, kerensky, had, to, ask, for, bolshevik, assistance, he, also, sought, help, from, the, petrograd, soviet, which, called, upon, armed, red, guards, to, defend, the, revolution, the, kornilov, affair, failed, largely, due, to, the, efforts, of, the, bolsheviks, whose, influence, over, railroad, and, telegraph, workers, proved, vital, in, stopping, the, movement, of, troops, with, his, coup, failing, kornilov, surrendered, and, was, relieved, of, his, position, the, bolsheviks, role, in, stopping, the, attempted, coup, further, strengthened, their, position, in, early, september, the, petrograd, soviet, freed, all, jailed, bolsheviks, and, trotsky, became, chairman, of, the, petrograd, soviet, growing, numbers, of, socialists, and, lower, class, russians, viewed, the, government, less, as, a, force, in, support, of, their, needs, and, interests, the, bolsheviks, benefited, as, the, only, major, organized, opposition, party, that, had, refused, to, compromise, with, the, provisional, government, and, they, benefited, from, growing, frustration, and, even, disgust, with, other, parties, such, as, the, mensheviks, and, socialist, revolutionaries, who, stubbornly, refused, to, break, with, the, idea, of, national, unity, across, all, classes, in, finland, lenin, had, worked, on, his, book, state, and, revolution, and, continued, to, lead, his, party, writing, newspaper, articles, and, policy, decrees, by, october, he, returned, to, petrograd, present, day, st, petersburg, aware, that, the, increasingly, radical, city, presented, him, no, legal, danger, and, a, second, opportunity, for, revolution, recognising, the, strength, of, the, bolsheviks, lenin, began, pressing, for, the, immediate, overthrow, of, the, kerensky, government, by, the, bolsheviks, lenin, was, of, the, opinion, that, taking, power, should, occur, in, both, st, petersburg, and, moscow, simultaneously, parenthetically, stating, that, it, made, no, difference, which, city, rose, up, first, the, bolshevik, central, committee, drafted, a, resolution, calling, for, the, dissolution, of, the, provisional, government, in, favor, of, the, petrograd, soviet, the, resolution, was, passed, 10, 2, lev, kamenev, and, grigory, zinoviev, prominently, dissenting, promoting, the, october, revolution, the, october, revolution, which, unfolded, on, wednesday, 7, november, 1917, according, to, the, gregorian, calendar, and, on, wednesday, 25, october, according, to, the, julian, calendar, in, use, under, tsarist, russia, was, organized, by, the, bolshevik, party, lenin, did, not, have, any, direct, role, in, the, revolution, and, he, was, hiding, for, his, personal, safety, however, in, late, october, lenin, secretly, and, at, great, personal, risk, entered, petrograd, and, attended, a, private, gathering, of, the, bolshevik, central, committee, on, the, evening, of, october, 23, the, revolutionary, military, committee, established, by, the, bolshevik, party, was, organizing, the, insurrection, and, leon, trotsky, was, the, chairman, 50, 000, workers, had, passed, a, resolution, in, favour, of, bolshevik, demand, for, transfer, of, power, to, the, soviets, however, lenin, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, debate, in, the, leadership, of, the, bolshevik, party, for, a, revolutionary, insurrection, as, the, party, in, the, autumn, of, 1917, received, a, majority, in, the, soviets, an, ally, in, the, left, fraction, of, the, revolutionary, socialist, party, with, huge, support, among, the, peasants, who, opposed, russia, s, participation, in, the, war, supported, the, slogan, all, power, to, the, soviets, the, initial, stage, of, the, october, revolution, which, involved, the, assault, on, petrograd, occurred, largely, without, any, human, casualties, liberal, and, monarchist, forces, loosely, organized, into, the, white, army, immediately, went, to, war, against, the, bolsheviks, red, army, in, a, series, of, battles, that, would, become, known, as, the, russian, civil, war, this, did, not, happen, in, 1917, the, civil, war, began, in, early, 1918, with, domestic, anti, bolshevik, forces, confronting, the, nascent, red, army, in, autumn, of, 1918, allied, countries, needed, to, block, german, access, to, russian, supplies, they, sent, troops, to, support, the, whites, with, supplies, of, weapons, ammunition, and, logistic, equipment, being, sent, from, the, main, western, countries, but, this, was, not, at, all, coordinated, germany, did, not, participate, in, the, civil, war, as, it, surrendered, to, the, allied, the, provisional, government, with, its, second, and, third, coalition, was, led, by, a, right, wing, fraction, of, the, socialist, revolutionary, party, sr, this, non, elected, provisional, government, faced, the, revolutionary, situation, and, the, growing, mood, against, the, war, by, avoiding, elections, to, the, state, duma, however, the, october, revolution, forced, the, political, parties, behind, the, newly, dissolved, provisional, government, to, move, and, move, fast, for, immediate, elections, all, happened, so, fast, that, the, left, sr, fraction, did, not, have, time, to, reach, out, and, be, represented, in, ballots, of, the, sr, party, which, was, part, of, the, coalition, in, the, provisional, government, this, non, elected, government, supported, continuation, of, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, allied, forces, the, elections, to, the, state, duma, 25, november, 1917, therefore, did, not, mirror, the, true, political, situation, among, peasants, even, if, we, don, t, know, how, the, outcome, would, be, if, the, anti, war, left, sr, fraction, had, a, fair, chance, to, challenge, the, party, leaders, in, the, elections, the, bolshevik, party, received, 25, of, the, votes, and, the, socialist, revolutionaries, as, much, as, 58, it, is, possible, the, left, sr, had, a, good, chance, to, reach, more, than, 25, of, the, votes, and, thereby, legitimate, the, october, revolution, but, we, can, only, guess, after, the, majority, of, the, petrograd, soviet, passed, into, the, hands, of, the, bolsheviks, was, elected, its, chairman, and, in, that, position, organized, and, led, the, insurrection, of, october, 25, lenin, on, the, organization, of, the, october, revolution, vol, xiv, of, the, collected, works, lenin, did, not, believe, that, a, socialist, revolution, necessarily, presupposed, a, fully, developed, capitalist, economy, a, semi, capitalist, country, would, suffice, and, russia, had, a, working, class, base, of, 5, of, the, population, though, lenin, was, the, leader, of, the, bolshevik, party, it, has, been, argued, that, since, lenin, was, not, present, during, the, actual, takeover, of, the, winter, palace, it, was, really, trotsky, s, organization, and, direction, that, led, the, revolution, merely, spurred, by, the, motivation, lenin, instigated, within, his, party, bolshevik, figures, such, as, anatoly, lunacharsky, moisei, uritsky, and, dmitry, manuilsky, agreed, that, lenin, s, influence, on, the, bolshevik, party, was, decisive, but, the, october, insurrection, was, carried, out, according, to, trotsky, s, not, to, lenin, s, plan, critics, on, the, right, have, long, argued, that, the, financial, and, logistical, assistance, of, german, intelligence, via, their, key, agent, alexander, parvus, was, a, key, component, as, well, though, historians, are, divided, since, there, is, little, evidence, supporting, that, claim, soviet, membership, was, initially, freely, elected, but, many, members, of, the, socialist, revolutionary, party, anarchists, and, other, leftists, created, opposition, to, the, bolsheviks, through, the, soviets, themselves, the, elections, to, the, russian, constituent, assembly, took, place, 25, november, 1917, the, bolsheviks, gained, 25, of, the, vote, when, it, became, clear, that, the, bolsheviks, had, little, support, outside, of, the, industrialized, areas, of, saint, petersburg, and, moscow, they, simply, barred, non, bolsheviks, from, membership, in, the, soviets, the, bolsheviks, dissolved, the, constituent, assembly, in, january, 1918, the, russian, civil, war, which, broke, out, in, 1918, shortly, after, the, october, revolution, resulted, in, the, deaths, and, suffering, of, millions, of, people, regardless, of, their, political, orientation, the, war, was, fought, mainly, between, the, red, army, reds, consisting, of, the, uprising, majority, led, by, the, bolshevik, minority, and, the, whites, army, officers, and, cossacks, the, bourgeoisie, and, political, groups, ranging, from, the, far, right, to, the, socialist, revolutionaries, who, opposed, the, drastic, restructuring, championed, by, the, bolsheviks, following, the, collapse, of, the, provisional, government, to, the, soviets, under, clear, bolshevik, dominance, the, whites, had, backing, from, other, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, france, the, united, states, and, japan, while, the, reds, possessed, internal, support, proving, to, be, much, more, effective, though, the, allied, nations, using, external, interference, provided, substantial, military, aid, to, the, loosely, knit, anti, bolshevik, forces, they, were, ultimately, defeated, the, bolsheviks, firstly, assumed, power, in, petrograd, expanding, their, rule, outwards, they, eventually, reached, the, easterly, siberian, russian, coast, in, vladivostok, four, years, after, the, war, began, an, occupation, that, is, believed, to, have, ended, all, significant, military, campaigns, in, the, nation, less, than, one, year, later, the, last, area, controlled, by, the, white, army, the, ayano, maysky, district, directly, to, the, north, of, the, krai, containing, vladivostok, was, given, up, when, general, anatoly, pepelyayev, capitulated, in, 1923, several, revolts, were, initiated, against, the, bolsheviks, and, their, army, near, the, end, of, the, war, notably, the, kronstadt, rebellion, this, was, a, naval, mutiny, engineered, by, soviet, baltic, sailors, former, red, army, soldiers, and, the, people, of, kronstadt, this, armed, uprising, was, fought, against, the, antagonizing, bolshevik, economic, policies, that, farmers, were, subjected, to, including, seizures, of, grain, crops, by, the, communists, this, all, amounted, to, large, scale, discontent, when, delegates, representing, the, kronstadt, sailors, arrived, at, petrograd, for, negotiations, they, raised, 15, demands, primarily, pertaining, to, the, russian, right, to, freedom, the, government, firmly, denounced, the, rebellions, and, labelled, the, requests, as, a, reminder, of, the, social, revolutionaries, a, political, party, that, was, popular, among, soviets, before, lenin, but, refused, to, cooperate, with, the, bolshevik, army, the, government, then, responded, with, an, armed, suppression, of, these, revolts, and, suffered, ten, thousand, casualties, before, entering, the, city, of, kronstadt, this, ended, the, rebellions, fairly, quickly, causing, many, of, the, rebels, to, flee, seeking, political, exile, during, the, civil, war, nestor, makhno, led, a, ukrainian, anarchist, movement, makhno, s, insurgent, army, allied, to, the, bolsheviks, thrice, with, one, of, the, powers, ending, the, alliance, each, time, however, a, bolshevik, force, under, mikhail, frunze, destroyed, the, makhnovshchina, when, the, makhnovists, refused, to, merge, into, the, red, army, in, addition, the, so, called, green, army, peasants, defending, their, property, against, the, opposing, forces, played, a, secondary, role, in, the, war, mainly, in, ukraine, revolutionary, tribunals, were, present, during, both, the, revolution, and, the, civil, war, intended, for, the, purpose, of, combatting, forces, of, counter, revolution, at, the, civil, war, s, zenith, it, is, reported, that, upwards, of, 200, 000, cases, were, investigated, by, approximately, 200, tribunals, these, tribunals, established, themselves, more, so, from, the, cheka, as, a, more, moderate, force, that, acted, under, the, banner, of, revolutionary, justice, rather, than, a, utilizer, of, strict, brute, force, as, the, former, did, however, these, tribunals, did, come, with, their, own, set, of, inefficiencies, such, as, responding, to, cases, in, a, matter, of, months, and, not, having, a, concrete, definition, of, counter, revolution, that, was, determined, on, a, case, by, case, basis, the, decree, on, revolutionary, tribunals, used, by, the, people, s, commissar, of, justice, states, in, article, 2, that, in, fixing, the, penalty, the, revolutionary, tribunal, shall, be, guided, by, the, circumstances, of, the, case, and, the, dictates, of, the, revolutionary, conscience, revolutionary, tribunals, ultimately, demonstrated, that, a, form, of, justice, was, still, prevalent, in, russian, society, where, the, russian, provisional, government, failed, this, in, part, triggered, the, political, transition, of, the, october, revolution, and, the, civil, war, that, followed, in, its, aftermath, the, bolsheviks, murdered, the, tsar, and, his, family, on, 16, july, 1918, in, early, march, 1917, the, provisional, government, had, placed, nicholas, and, his, family, under, house, arrest, in, the, alexander, palace, at, tsarskoye, selo, 24, kilometres, 15, mi, south, of, petrograd, but, in, august, 1917, they, evacuated, the, romanovs, to, tobolsk, in, the, urals, to, protect, them, from, the, rising, tide, of, revolution, after, the, bolsheviks, came, to, power, in, october, 1917, the, conditions, of, their, imprisonment, grew, stricter, and, talk, of, putting, nicholas, on, trial, increased, in, april, and, may, 1918, the, looming, civil, war, led, the, bolsheviks, to, move, the, family, to, the, stronghold, of, yekaterinburg, during, the, early, morning, of, 16, july, nicholas, alexandra, their, children, their, physician, and, several, servants, were, taken, into, the, basement, and, shot, according, to, edvard, radzinsky, and, dmitrii, volkogonov, the, order, came, directly, from, lenin, and, yakov, sverdlov, in, moscow, however, this, claim, has, never, been, confirmed, the, murder, may, have, been, carried, out, on, the, initiative, of, local, bolshevik, officials, or, it, may, have, been, an, option, pre, approved, in, moscow, as, white, troops, were, rapidly, approaching, yekaterinburg, radzinsky, noted, that, lenin, s, bodyguard, personally, delivered, the, telegram, ordering, the, killing, and, that, he, was, ordered, to, destroy, the, evidence, the, russian, revolution, became, the, site, for, many, instances, of, symbolism, both, physical, and, non, physical, communist, symbolism, is, perhaps, the, most, notable, of, this, time, period, such, as, the, debut, of, the, iconic, hammer, and, sickle, as, a, representation, of, the, october, revolution, in, 1917, eventually, becoming, the, official, symbol, of, the, ussr, in, 1924, and, later, the, symbol, of, communism, as, a, whole, although, the, bolsheviks, did, not, have, extensive, political, experience, their, portrayal, of, the, revolution, itself, as, both, a, political, and, symbolic, order, resulted, in, communism, s, portrayal, as, a, messianic, faith, formally, known, as, communist, messianism, portrayals, of, notable, revolutionary, figures, such, as, lenin, were, done, in, iconographic, methods, equating, them, similarly, to, religious, figures, though, religion, itself, was, banned, in, the, ussr, and, groups, such, as, the, russian, orthodox, church, were, persecuted, the, revolution, ultimately, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, future, soviet, union, as, an, ideocracy, however, the, establishment, of, such, a, state, came, as, an, ideological, paradox, as, marx, s, ideals, of, how, a, socialist, state, ought, to, be, created, were, based, on, the, formation, being, natural, and, not, artificially, incited, i, e, by, means, of, revolution, leon, trotsky, said, that, the, goal, of, socialism, in, russia, would, not, be, realized, without, the, success, of, the, world, revolution, a, revolutionary, wave, caused, by, the, russian, revolution, lasted, until, 1923, but, despite, initial, hopes, for, success, in, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 19, the, short, lived, hungarian, soviet, republic, and, others, like, it, only, the, mongolian, revolution, of, 1921, saw, a, marxist, movement, at, the, time, succeed, in, keeping, power, in, its, hands, this, issue, is, subject, to, conflicting, views, on, communist, history, by, various, marxist, groups, and, parties, joseph, stalin, later, rejected, this, idea, stating, that, socialism, was, possible, in, one, country, the, confusion, regarding, stalin, s, position, on, the, issue, stems, from, the, fact, that, after, lenin, s, death, in, 1924, he, successfully, used, lenin, s, argument, the, argument, that, socialism, s, success, needs, the, support, of, workers, of, other, countries, in, order, to, happen, to, defeat, his, competitors, within, the, party, by, accusing, them, of, betraying, lenin, and, therefore, the, ideals, of, the, october, revolution, the, russian, revolution, was, perceived, as, a, rupture, with, imperialism, for, various, civil, rights, and, decolonization, struggles, and, providing, a, space, for, oppressed, groups, across, the, world, this, was, given, further, credence, with, the, soviet, union, supporting, many, anti, colonial, third, world, movements, with, financial, funds, against, european, colonial, powers, few, events, in, historical, research, have, been, as, conditioned, by, political, influences, as, the, october, revolution, the, historiography, of, the, revolution, generally, divides, into, three, schools, of, thought, the, soviet, marxist, view, the, western, totalitarian, view, and, the, revisionist, trotskyist, view, since, the, fall, of, communism, and, the, ussr, in, russia, in, 1991, the, western, totalitarian, view, has, again, become, dominant, and, the, soviet, marxist, view, has, practically, vanished, in, mainstream, political, analysis, following, the, death, of, vladimir, lenin, the, bolshevik, government, was, thrown, into, a, crisis, lenin, failed, to, designate, who, his, successor, would, be, or, how, they, would, be, chosen, a, power, struggle, broke, out, in, the, party, between, leon, trotsky, and, his, enemies, trotsky, was, defeated, by, the, anti, trotsky, bloc, by, the, mid, 1920s, and, his, hopes, for, party, leadership, were, dashed, among, trotsky, s, opponents, joseph, stalin, would, rise, to, assume, unchallenged, party, leadership, by, 1928, in, 1927, trotsky, was, expelled, from, the, party, and, in, 1929, he, lost, his, citizenship, and, was, sent, into, exile, while, in, exile, he, began, honing, his, own, interpretation, of, marxism, called, trotskyism, the, schism, between, trotsky, and, stalin, is, the, focal, point, where, the, revisionist, view, comes, into, existence, trotsky, traveled, across, the, world, denouncing, stalin, and, the, soviet, union, under, his, leadership, he, specifically, focused, his, criticism, on, stalin, s, doctrine, socialism, in, one, country, claiming, that, it, was, incongruent, with, the, ideology, of, the, revolution, eventually, trotsky, settled, in, mexico, city, and, founded, a, base, of, operations, for, him, and, his, supporters, in, 1937, at, the, height, of, the, great, purge, he, published, the, revolution, betrayed, which, outlined, his, ideological, contradictions, with, stalin, and, how, stalin, was, guilty, of, subverting, and, debasing, the, 1917, revolution, he, continued, to, vocally, criticize, stalin, and, stalinism, until, his, assassination, in, 1940, on, stalin, s, orders, the, soviet, marxist, interpretation, is, the, belief, that, the, russian, revolution, under, the, bolsheviks, was, a, proud, and, glorious, effort, of, the, working, class, which, saw, the, removal, of, the, tsar, nobility, and, capitalists, from, positions, of, power, the, bolsheviks, and, later, the, communist, party, took, the, first, steps, in, liberating, the, proletariat, and, building, a, workers, state, that, practiced, equality, outside, of, eastern, europe, this, view, was, heavily, criticized, as, following, the, death, of, lenin, the, soviet, union, became, more, authoritarian, even, though, the, soviet, union, no, longer, exists, the, soviet, marxist, view, is, still, interpreted, in, academia, today, both, academics, and, soviet, supporters, acknowledge, this, view, is, bolstered, by, several, key, events, first, the, rsfsr, made, substantial, advances, to, women, s, rights, it, was, the, first, country, to, decriminalize, abortion, and, allowed, women, to, be, educated, which, was, forbidden, under, the, tsar, furthermore, the, rsfsr, decriminalized, homosexuality, between, consenting, adults, which, was, seen, as, radical, for, the, time, period, the, bolshevik, government, also, actively, recruited, working, class, citizens, into, positions, of, party, leadership, thereby, ensuring, the, proletariat, had, a, voice, in, policymaking, one, of, the, most, important, aspects, to, this, view, was, the, bolshevik, victory, in, the, russian, civil, war, on, paper, the, bolsheviks, should, have, been, defeated, in, part, due, to, the, broad, international, support, their, enemies, were, receiving, britain, france, the, united, states, japan, and, other, countries, sent, aid, to, the, white, army, and, expedition, forces, against, the, bolsheviks, the, bolsheviks, were, further, at, a, disadvantage, due, to, factors, such, as, the, small, land, area, under, their, control, lack, of, professional, officers, and, supply, shortages, in, spite, of, this, the, red, army, prevailed, the, red, army, unlike, many, white, factions, maintained, a, high, morale, among, their, troops, and, civilians, throughout, the, duration, of, the, civil, war, this, was, in, part, due, to, their, skillful, use, propaganda, bolshevik, propaganda, portrayed, the, red, army, as, liberators, and, stewards, of, the, poor, and, downtrodden, bolshevik, support, was, further, elevated, by, lenin, s, initiatives, to, distribute, land, to, the, peasantry, and, ending, the, war, with, germany, during, the, civil, war, the, bolsheviks, were, able, to, raise, an, army, numbering, around, five, million, active, soldiers, domestic, support, and, patriotism, played, a, decisive, role, in, the, russian, civil, war, by, 1923, the, bolsheviks, had, controlled, the, last, of, the, white, army, holdouts, and, the, russian, civil, war, concluded, with, a, bolshevik, victory, this, victory, ultimately, influenced, how, the, soviet, union, interpreted, its, own, ideology, and, the, october, revolution, itself, starting, in, 1919, the, soviets, would, commemorate, the, event, with, a, military, parade, and, a, public, holiday, this, tradition, lasted, up, until, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, as, time, went, on, the, soviet, marxist, interpretation, evolved, with, an, anti, stalinist, version, of, it, this, subsection, attempts, to, draw, a, distinction, between, the, lenin, period, 1917, 24, and, the, stalin, period, 1928, 53, nikita, khrushchev, stalin, s, successor, argued, that, stalin, s, regime, differed, greatly, from, the, leadership, of, lenin, in, his, secret, speech, delivered, in, 1956, he, was, critical, of, the, cult, of, the, individual, which, was, constructed, around, stalin, whereas, lenin, stressed, the, role, of, the, people, as, the, creator, of, history, he, also, emphasized, that, lenin, favored, a, collective, leadership, which, relied, on, personal, persuasion, and, recommended, the, removal, of, stalin, from, the, position, of, general, secretary, khrushchev, contrasted, this, with, the, despotism, of, stalin, which, require, absolute, submission, to, his, position, and, also, highlighted, that, many, of, the, people, who, were, later, annihilated, as, enemies, of, the, party, had, worked, with, lenin, during, his, life, he, also, contrasted, the, severe, methods, used, by, lenin, in, the, most, necessary, cases, as, a, struggle, for, survival, during, the, civil, war, with, the, extreme, methods, and, mass, repressions, used, by, stalin, even, when, the, revolution, was, already, victorious, views, from, the, west, were, mixed, socialists, and, labor, organizations, tended, to, support, the, october, revolution, and, the, bolshevik, seizure, of, power, on, the, other, hand, western, governments, were, mortified, western, leaders, and, later, some, academics, concluded, that, the, russian, revolution, only, replaced, one, form, of, tyranny, tsarism, with, another, communism, initially, the, bolsheviks, were, tolerant, of, opposing, political, factions, upon, seizing, state, power, they, organized, a, parliament, the, russian, constituent, assembly, on, november, 25, an, election, was, held, despite, the, bolsheviks, being, the, party, that, overthrew, the, provisional, government, and, organizing, the, assembly, they, lost, the, election, rather, than, govern, as, a, coalition, the, bolsheviks, banned, all, political, opposition, historians, point, to, this, as, the, start, of, communist, authoritarianism, conservative, historian, robert, service, states, he, lenin, aided, the, foundations, of, dictatorship, and, lawlessness, he, had, consolidated, the, principle, of, state, penetration, of, the, whole, society, its, economy, and, its, culture, lenin, had, practiced, terror, and, advocated, revolutionary, amoralism, lenin, allowed, for, certain, disagreement, and, debate, but, only, within, the, highest, organs, of, the, bolshevik, party, and, practicing, democratic, centralism, the, rsfsr, and, later, the, soviet, union, continued, to, practice, political, repression, until, its, dissolution, in, 1991, trotskyist, theoreticians, have, disputed, the, view, that, a, one, party, state, was, a, natural, outgrowth, of, the, bolsheviks, actions, george, novack, stressed, the, initial, efforts, by, the, bolsheviks, to, form, a, government, with, the, left, socialist, revolutionaries, and, bring, other, parties, such, as, the, mensheviks, into, political, legality, tony, cliff, argued, the, bolshevik, left, socialist, revolutionary, coalition, government, dissolved, the, constituent, assembly, due, to, a, number, of, reasons, they, cited, the, outdated, voter, rolls, which, did, not, acknowledge, the, split, among, the, socialist, revolutionary, party, and, the, assemblies, conflict, with, the, congress, of, the, soviets, as, an, alternative, democratic, structure, trotskyist, historian, vadim, rogovin, believed, stalinism, had, discredited, the, idea, of, socialism, in, the, eyes, of, millions, of, people, throughout, the, world, rogovin, also, argued, that, the, left, opposition, led, by, leon, trotsky, was, a, political, movement, which, offered, a, real, alternative, to, stalinism, and, that, to, crush, this, movement, was, the, primary, function, of, the, stalinist, terror, the, russian, revolution, has, been, portrayed, in, or, served, as, backdrop, for, many, films, among, them, in, order, of, release, date
