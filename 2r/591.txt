historical, kongo, empire, it, rapidly, developed, into, a, nationalist, movement, supported, in, its, struggle, against, portugal, by, the, government, of, mobutu, sese, seko, in, zaire, during, 1974, the, fnla, was, also, briefly, supported, by, the, people, s, republic, of, china, but, the, aid, was, quickly, withdrawn, since, china, mainly, supported, the, unita, during, the, angolan, war, of, independence, the, united, states, refused, to, support, the, fnla, during, the, movement, s, war, against, portugal, a, nato, member, but, agreed, during, the, civil, war, unita, s, main, social,

peoples, of, eastern, angola, unita, was, founded, in, 1966, by, jonas, savimbi, who, until, then, had, been, a, prominent, leader, of, the, fnla, during, the, anti, colonial, war, unita, received, some, support, from, the, people, s, republic, of, china, with, the, onset, of, the, civil, war, the, united, states, decided, to, support, unita, and, considerably, augmented, their, aid, to, unita, in, the, following, decades, in, the, latter, period, unita, s, main, ally, was, the, apartheid, regime, of, south, africa, angola, like, most, african, countries, became, constituted, as, a, nation, through, colonial, intervention, angola, s, colonial, power, was, portugal, which, was, present, and, active, in, the, territory, in, one, way, or, another, for, over, four, centuries, the, original, population, of, this, territory, were, dispersed, khoisan, groups, these, were, absorbed, or, pushed, southwards, where, residual, groups, still, exist, by, a, massive, influx, of, bantu, people, who, came, from, the, north, and, east, the, bantu, influx, began, around, 500, bc, and, some, continued, their, migrations, inside, the, territory, well, into, the, 20th, century, they, established, a, number, of, major, political, units, of, which, the, most, important, was, the, kongo, empire, whose, centre, was, located, in, the, northwest, of, what, today, is, angola, and, which, stretched, northwards, into, the, west, of, the, present, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, drc, the, south, and, west, of, the, contemporary, republic, of, congo, and, even, the, southernmost, part, of, gabon, also, of, historical, importance, were, the, ndongo, and, matamba, kingdoms, to, the, south, of, the, kongo, empire, in, the, ambundu, area, additionally, the, lunda, empire, occupied, a, portion, of, north, eastern, angola, in, the, south, east, of, the, present, day, drc, in, the, south, of, the, territory, and, the, north, of, present, day, namibia, lay, the, kwanyama, kingdom, along, with, minor, realms, on, the, central, highlands, all, these, political, units, were, a, reflection, of, ethnic, cleavages, that, slowly, developed, among, the, bantu, populations, and, were, instrumental, in, consolidating, these, cleavages, and, fostering, the, emergence, of, new, and, distinct, social, identities, at, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, portuguese, settlers, made, contact, with, the, kongo, empire, maintaining, a, continuous, presence, in, its, territory, and, enjoying, considerable, cultural, and, religious, influence, after, that, in, 1575, portugal, established, a, settlement, and, fort, called, saint, paul, of, luanda, on, the, coast, south, of, the, kongo, empire, in, an, area, inhabited, by, ambundu, people, another, fort, benguela, was, established, on, the, coast, further, south, in, a, region, inhabited, by, ancestors, of, the, ovimbundu, people, neither, of, these, portuguese, settlement, efforts, was, launched, for, the, purpose, of, territorial, conquest, both, gradually, came, to, occupy, and, farm, a, broad, area, around, their, initial, bridgeheads, in, the, case, of, luanda, mostly, along, the, lower, kwanza, river, their, main, function, was, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, slaves, were, bought, from, african, intermediaries, and, sold, to, portuguese, colonies, in, brazil, and, the, caribbean, in, addition, benguela, developed, commerce, in, ivory, wax, and, honey, which, they, bought, from, ovimbundu, caravans, which, fetched, these, goods, from, among, the, ganguela, peoples, in, the, eastern, part, of, what, is, now, angola, nonetheless, the, portuguese, presence, on, the, angolan, coast, remained, limited, for, much, of, the, colonial, period, the, degree, of, real, colonial, settlement, was, minor, and, with, few, exceptions, the, portuguese, did, not, interfere, by, means, other, than, commercial, in, the, social, and, political, dynamics, of, the, native, peoples, there, was, no, real, delimitation, of, territory, angola, to, all, intents, and, purposes, did, not, yet, exist, in, the, 19th, century, the, portuguese, began, a, more, serious, program, of, advancing, into, the, continental, interior, they, wanted, a, de, facto, overlordship, that, allowed, them, to, establish, commercial, networks, and, a, few, settlements, in, this, context, they, also, moved, further, south, along, the, coast, and, founded, the, third, bridgehead, of, mo, medes, in, the, course, of, this, expansion, they, entered, into, conflict, with, several, of, the, african, political, units, territorial, occupation, only, became, a, central, concern, for, portugal, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 19th, century, during, the, european, powers, scramble, for, africa, especially, following, the, 1884, berlin, conference, several, military, expeditions, were, organized, as, preconditions, for, obtaining, territory, which, roughly, corresponded, to, present, day, angola, by, 1906, about, 6, of, that, territory, was, effectively, occupied, and, the, military, campaigns, had, to, continue, by, the, mid, 1920s, the, limits, of, the, territory, were, finally, fixed, and, the, last, primary, resistance, was, quelled, in, the, early, 1940s, it, is, thus, reasonable, to, talk, of, angola, as, a, defined, territorial, entity, from, this, point, onwards, in, 1961, the, fnla, and, the, mpla, based, in, neighbouring, countries, began, a, guerrilla, campaign, against, portuguese, rule, on, several, fronts, the, portuguese, colonial, war, which, included, the, angolan, war, of, independence, lasted, until, the, portuguese, regime, s, overthrow, in, 1974, through, a, leftist, military, coup, in, lisbon, when, the, timeline, for, independence, became, known, most, of, the, roughly, 500, 000, ethnic, portuguese, angolans, fled, the, territory, during, the, weeks, before, or, after, that, deadline, portugal, left, behind, a, newly, independent, country, whose, population, was, mainly, composed, of, ambundu, ovimbundu, and, bakongo, peoples, the, portuguese, that, lived, in, angola, accounted, for, the, majority, of, the, skilled, workers, in, public, administration, agriculture, and, industry, once, they, fled, the, country, the, national, economy, began, to, sink, into, depression, the, south, african, government, initially, became, involved, in, an, effort, to, counter, the, chinese, presence, in, angola, which, was, feared, might, escalate, the, conflict, into, a, local, theatre, of, the, cold, war, in, 1975, south, african, prime, minister, b, j, vorster, authorized, operation, savannah, which, began, as, an, effort, to, protect, engineers, constructing, the, dam, at, calueque, after, unruly, unita, soldiers, took, over, the, dam, paid, for, by, south,

government, was, in, place, and, thus, no, clear, lines, of, authority, the, south, africans, came, to, commit, thousands, of, soldiers, to, the, intervention, and, ultimately, clashed, with, cuban,

in, support, of, the, mpla, cuba, had, initially, provided, the, mpla, with, 230, military, advisers, prior, to, the, south, african, intervention, the, cuban, intervention, proved, decisive, in,
