agriculture, began, independently, in, different, parts, of, the, globe, and, included, a, diverse, range, of, taxa, at, least, eleven, separate, regions, of, the, old, and, new, world, were, involved, as, independent, centers, of, origin, the, development, of, agriculture, about, 12, 000, years, ago, changed, the, way, humans, lived, they, switched, from, nomadic, hunter, gatherer, lifestyles, to, permanent, settlements, and, farming, wild, grains, were, collected, and, eaten, from, at, least, 104, 000, years, ago, however, domestication, did, not, occur, until, much, later, the, earliest, evidence, of, small, scale, cultivation, of, edible, grasses, is, from, around, 21, 000, bc, with, the, ohalo, ii, people, on, the, shores, of, the, sea, of, galilee, by, around, 9500, bc, the, eight, neolithic, founder, crops, emmer, wheat, einkorn, wheat, hulled, barley, peas, lentils, bitter, vetch, chickpeas, and, flax, were, cultivated, in, the, levant, rye, may, have, been, cultivated, earlier, but, this, claim, remains, controversial, regardless, rye, s, spread, from, southwest, asia, to, the, atlantic, was, independent, of, the, neolithic, founder, crop, package, rice, was, domesticated, in, china, by, 6200, bc, with, earliest, known, cultivation, from, 5700, bc, followed, by, mung, soy, and, azuki, beans, rice, was, also, independently, domesticated, in, west, africa, and, cultivated, by, 1000, bc, pigs, were, domesticated, in, mesopotamia, around, 11, 000, years, ago, followed, by, sheep, cattle, were, domesticated, from, the, wild, aurochs, in, the, areas, of, modern, turkey, and, india, around, 8500, bc, camels, were, domesticated, late, perhaps, around, 3000, bc, in, subsaharan, africa, sorghum, was, domesticated, in, the, sahel, region, of, africa, by, 3000, bc, along, with, pearl, millet, by, 2000, bc, yams, were, domesticated, in, several, distinct, locations, including, west, africa, unknown, date, and, cowpeas, by, 2500, bc, rice, african, rice, was, also, independently, domesticated, in, west, africa, and, cultivated, by, 1000, bc, teff, and, likely, finger, millet, were, domesticated, in, ethiopia, by, 3000, bc, along, with, noog, ensete, and, coffee, other, plant, foods, domesticated, in, africa, include, watermelon, okra, tamarind, and, black, eyed, peas, along, with, tree, crops, such, as, the, kola, nut, and, oil, palm, plantains, were, cultivated, in, africa, by, 3000, bc, and, bananas, by, 1500, bc, the, helmeted, guineafowl, was, domesticated, in, west, africa, sanga, cattle, was, likely, also, domesticated, in, north, east, africa, around, 7000, bc, and, later, crossbred, with, other, species, in, south, america, agriculture, began, as, early, as, 9000, bc, starting, with, the, cultivation, of, several, species, of, plants, that, later, became, only, minor, crops, in, the, andes, of, south, america, the, potato, was, domesticated, between, 8000, bc, and, 5000, bc, along, with, beans, squash, tomatoes, peanuts, coca, llamas, alpacas, and, guinea, pigs, cassava, was, domesticated, in, the, amazon, basin, no, later, than, 7000, bc, maize, zea, mays, found, its, way, to, south, america, from, mesoamerica, where, wild, teosinte, was, domesticated, about, 7000, bc, and, selectively, bred, to, become, domestic, maize, cotton, was, domesticated, in, peru, by, 4200, bc, another, species, of, cotton, was, domesticated, in, mesoamerica, and, became, by, far, the, most, important, species, of, cotton, in, the, textile, industry, in, modern, times, evidence, of, agriculture, in, the, eastern, united, states, dates, to, about, 3000, bce, several, plants, were, cultivated, later, to, be, replaced, by, the, three, sisters, cultivation, of, maize, squash, and, beans, sugarcane, and, some, root, vegetables, were, domesticated, in, new, guinea, around, 7000, bc, bananas, were, cultivated, and, hybridized, in, the, same, period, in, papua, new, guinea, in, australia, agriculture, was, invented, at, a, currently, unspecified, period, with, the, oldest, eel, traps, of, budj, bim, dating, to, 6, 600, bc, and, the, deployment, of, several, crops, ranging, from, yams, to, bananas, the, bronze, age, from, c, 3300, bc, witnessed, the, intensification, of, agriculture, in, civilizations, such, as, mesopotamian, sumer, ancient, egypt, ancient, sudan, the, indus, valley, civilisation, of, the, indian, subcontinent, ancient, china, and, ancient, greece, from, 100, bc, to, 1600, ad, world, population, continued, to, grow, along, with, land, use, as, evidenced, by, the, rapid, increase, in, methane, emissions, from, cattle, and, the, cultivation, of, rice, during, the, iron, age, and, era, of, classical, antiquity, the, expansion, of, ancient, rome, both, the, republic, and, then, the, empire, throughout, the, ancient, mediterranean, and, western, europe, built, upon, existing, systems, of, agriculture, while, also, establishing, the, manorial, system, that, became, a, bedrock, of, medieval, agriculture, in, the, middle, ages, both, in, europe, and, in, the, islamic, world, agriculture, was, transformed, with, improved, techniques, and, the, diffusion, of, crop, plants, including, the, introduction, of, sugar, rice, cotton, and, fruit, trees, such, as, the, orange, to, europe, by, way, of, al, andalus, after, the, voyages, of, christopher, columbus, in, 1492, the, columbian, exchange, brought, new, world, crops, such, as, maize, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet, potatoes, and, manioc, to, europe, and, old, world, crops, such, as, wheat, barley, rice, and, turnips, and, livestock, including, horses, cattle, sheep, and, goats, to, the, americas, irrigation, crop, rotation, and, fertilizers, were, introduced, soon, after, the, neolithic, revolution, and, developed, much, further, in, the, past, 200, years, starting, with, the, british, agricultural, revolution, since, 1900, agriculture, in, the, developed, nations, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, the, developing, world, has, seen, large, rises, in, productivity, as, human, labour, has, been, replaced, by, mechanization, and, assisted, by, synthetic, fertilizers, pesticides, and, selective, breeding, the, haber, bosch, process, allowed, the, synthesis, of, ammonium, nitrate, fertilizer, on, an, industrial, scale, greatly, increasing, crop, yields, modern, agriculture, has, raised, social, political, and, environmental, issues, including, overpopulation, water, pollution, biofuels, genetically, modified, organisms, tariffs, and, farm, subsidies, in, response, organic, farming, developed, in, the, twentieth, century, as, an, alternative, to, the, use, of, synthetic, pesticides, scholars, have, developed, a, number, of, hypotheses, to, explain, the, historical, origins, of, agriculture, studies, of, the, transition, from, hunter, gatherer, to, agricultural, societies, indicate, an, antecedent, period, of, intensification, and, increasing, sedentism, examples, are, the, natufian, culture, in, the, levant, and, the, early, chinese, neolithic, in, china, current, models, indicate, that, wild, stands, that, had, been, harvested, previously, started, to, be, planted, but, were, not, immediately, domesticated, localised, climate, change, is, the, favoured, explanation, for, the, origins, of, agriculture, in, the, levant, when, major, climate, change, took, place, after, the, last, ice, age, c, 11, 000, bc, much, of, the, earth, became, subject, to, long, dry, seasons, these, conditions, favoured, annual, plants, which, die, off, in, the, long, dry, season, leaving, a, dormant, seed, or, tuber, an, abundance, of, readily, storable, wild, grains, and, pulses, enabled, hunter, gatherers, in, some, areas, to, form, the, first, settled, villages, at, this, time, across, western, eurasia, it, was, not, until, approximately, 4, 000, bp, that, farming, societies, completely, replaced, hunter, gatherers, these, technologically, advanced, societies, expanded, faster, in, areas, with, less, forest, pushing, hunter, gatherers, into, denser, woodlands, only, the, middle, late, bronze, age, and, iron, age, societies, were, able, to, fully, replace, hunter, gatherers, in, their, final, stronghold, located, in, the, most, densely, forested, areas, unlike, their, bronze, and, iron, age, counterparts, neolithic, societies, couldn, t, establish, themselves, in, dense, forests, and, copper, age, societies, had, only, limited, success, early, people, began, altering, communities, of, flora, and, fauna, for, their, own, benefit, through, means, such, as, fire, stick, farming, and, forest, gardening, very, early, wild, grains, have, been, collected, and, eaten, from, at, least, 105, 000, years, ago, and, possibly, much, longer, exact, dates, are, hard, to, determine, as, people, collected, and, ate, seeds, before, domesticating, them, and, plant, characteristics, may, have, changed, during, this, period, without, human, selection, an, example, is, the, semi, tough, rachis, and, larger, seeds, of, cereals, from, just, after, the, younger, dryas, about, 9500, bc, in, the, early, holocene, in, the, levant, region, of, the, fertile, crescent, monophyletic, characteristics, were, attained, without, any, human, intervention, implying, that, apparent, domestication, of, the, cereal, rachis, could, have, occurred, quite, naturally, agriculture, began, independently, in, different, parts, of, the, globe, and, included, a, diverse, range, of, taxa, at, least, 11, separate, regions, of, the, old, and, new, world, were, involved, as, independent, centers, of, origin, some, of, the, earliest, known, domestications, were, of, animals, domestic, pigs, had, multiple, centres, of, origin, in, eurasia, including, europe, east, asia, and, southwest, asia, where, wild, boar, were, first, domesticated, about, 10, 500, years, ago, sheep, were, domesticated, in, mesopotamia, between, 11, 000, bc, and, 9000, bc, cattle, were, domesticated, from, the, wild, aurochs, in, the, areas, of, modern, turkey, and, india, around, 8500, bc, camels, were, domesticated, relatively, late, perhaps, around, 3000, bc, it, was, not, until, after, 9500, bc, that, the, eight, so, called, founder, crops, of, agriculture, appear, first, emmer, and, einkorn, wheat, then, hulled, barley, peas, lentils, bitter, vetch, chick, peas, and, flax, these, eight, crops, occur, more, or, less, simultaneously, on, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, ppnb, sites, in, the, levant, although, wheat, was, the, first, to, be, grown, and, harvested, on, a, significant, scale, at, around, the, same, time, 9400, bc, parthenocarpic, fig, trees, were, domesticated, domesticated, rye, occurs, in, small, quantities, at, some, neolithic, sites, in, asia, minor, turkey, such, as, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, c, 7600, c, 6000, bc, can, hasan, iii, near, atalh, y, k, but, is, otherwise, absent, until, the, bronze, age, of, central, europe, c, 1800, 1500, bc, claims, of, much, earlier, cultivation, of, rye, at, the, epipalaeolithic, site, of, tell, abu, hureyra, in, the, euphrates, valley, of, northern, syria, remain, controversial, critics, point, to, inconsistencies, in, the, radiocarbon, dates, and, identifications, based, solely, on, grain, rather, than, on, chaff, by, 8000, bc, farming, was, entrenched, on, the, banks, of, the, nile, about, this, time, agriculture, was, developed, independently, in, the, far, east, probably, in, china, with, rice, rather, than, wheat, as, the, primary, crop, maize, was, domesticated, from, the, wild, grass, teosinte, in, southern, mexico, by, 6700, bc, the, potato, 8000, bc, tomato, pepper, 4000, bc, squash, 8000, bc, and, several, varieties, of, bean, 8000, bc, onwards, were, domesticated, in, the, new, world, agriculture, was, independently, developed, on, the, island, of, new, guinea, banana, cultivation, of, musa, acuminata, including, hybridization, dates, back, to, 5000, bc, and, possibly, to, 8000, bc, in, papua, new, guinea, bees, were, kept, for, honey, in, the, middle, east, around, 7000, bc, archaeological, evidence, from, various, sites, on, the, iberian, peninsula, suggest, the, domestication, of, plants, and, animals, between, 6000, and, 4500, bc, c, ide, fields, in, ireland, consisting, of, extensive, tracts, of, land, enclosed, by, stone, walls, date, to, 3500, bc, and, are, the, oldest, known, field, systems, in, the, world, the, horse, was, domesticated, in, the, pontic, steppe, around, 4000, bc, in, siberia, cannabis, was, in, use, in, china, in, neolithic, times, and, may, have, been, domesticated, there, it, was, in, use, both, as, a, fibre, for, ropemaking, and, as, a, medicine, in, ancient, egypt, by, about, 2350, bc, in, northern, china, millet, was, domesticated, by, early, sino, tibetan, speakers, at, around, 8000, to, 6000, bc, becoming, the, main, crop, of, the, yellow, river, basin, by, 5500, bc, they, were, followed, by, mung, soy, and, azuki, beans, in, southern, china, rice, was, domesticated, in, the, yangtze, river, basin, at, around, 11, 500, to, 6200, bc, along, with, the, development, of, wetland, agriculture, by, early, austronesian, and, hmong, mien, speakers, other, food, plants, were, also, harvested, including, acorns, water, chestnuts, and, foxnuts, rice, cultivation, was, later, spread, to, maritime, southeast, asia, by, the, austronesian, expansion, starting, at, around, 3, 500, to, 2, 000, bc, this, migration, event, also, saw, the, introduction, of, cultivated, and, domesticated, food, plants, from, taiwan, maritime, southeast, asia, and, new, guinea, into, the, pacific, islands, as, canoe, plants, contact, with, sri, lanka, and, southern, india, by, austronesian, sailors, also, led, to, an, exchange, of, food, plants, which, later, became, the, origin, of, the, valuable, spice, trade, in, the, 1st, millennium, ad, austronesian, sailors, also, settled, madagascar, and, the, comoros, bringing, southeast, asian, and, south, asian, food, plants, with, them, to, the, east, african, coast, including, bananas, and, rice, rice, was, also, spread, southwards, into, mainland, southeast, asia, by, around, 2000, to, 1500, bc, by, the, migrations, of, the, early, austroasiatic, and, kra, dai, speakers, in, the, sahel, region, of, africa, sorghum, was, domesticated, by, 3000, bc, in, sudan, and, pearl, millet, by, 2500, bc, in, mali, kola, nut, and, coffee, were, also, domesticated, in, africa, in, new, guinea, ancient, papuan, peoples, began, practicing, agriculture, around, 7000, bc, domesticating, sugarcane, and, taro, in, the, indus, valley, from, the, eighth, millennium, bc, onwards, at, mehrgarh, 2, row, and, 6, row, barley, were, cultivated, along, with, einkorn, emmer, and, durum, wheats, and, dates, in, the, earliest, levels, of, merhgarh, wild, game, such, as, gazelle, swamp, deer, blackbuck, chital, wild, ass, wild, goat, wild, sheep, boar, and, nilgai, were, all, hunted, for, food, these, are, successively, replaced, by, domesticated, sheep, goats, and, humped, zebu, cattle, by, the, fifth, millennium, bc, indicating, the, gradual, transition, from, hunting, and, gathering, to, agriculture, maize, and, squash, were, domesticated, in, mesoamerica, potatoes, in, south, america, and, sunflowers, in, the, eastern, woodlands, of, north, america, sumerian, farmers, grew, the, cereals, barley, and, wheat, starting, to, live, in, villages, from, about, 8000, bc, given, the, low, rainfall, of, the, region, agriculture, relied, on, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, irrigation, canals, leading, from, the, rivers, permitted, the, growth, of, cereals, in, large, enough, quantities, to, support, cities, the, first, ploughs, appear, in, pictographs, from, uruk, around, 3000, bc, seed, ploughs, that, funneled, seed, into, the, ploughed, furrow, appear, on, seals, around, 2300, bc, vegetable, crops, included, chickpeas, lentils, peas, beans, onions, garlic, lettuce, leeks, and, mustard, they, grew, fruits, including, dates, grapes, apples, melons, and, figs, alongside, their, farming, sumerians, also, caught, fish, and, hunted, fowl, and, gazelle, the, meat, of, sheep, goats, cows, and, poultry, was, eaten, mainly, by, the, elite, fish, was, preserved, by, drying, salting, and, smoking, the, civilization, of, ancient, egypt, was, indebted, to, the, nile, river, and, its, dependable, seasonal, flooding, the, river, s, predictability, and, the, fertile, soil, allowed, the, egyptians, to, build, an, empire, on, the, basis, of, great, agricultural, wealth, egyptians, were, among, the, first, peoples, to, practice, agriculture, on, a, large, scale, starting, in, the, pre, dynastic, period, from, the, end, of, the, paleolithic, into, the, neolithic, between, around, 10, 000, bc, and, 4000, bc, this, was, made, possible, with, the, development, of, basin, irrigation, their, staple, food, crops, were, grains, such, as, wheat, and, barley, alongside, industrial, crops, such, as, flax, and, papyrus, archaeological, evidence, also, suggests, that, the, spread, of, agriculture, was, facilitated, by, the, influx, of, farming, communities, from, the, tropical, sahara, 6, 500, years, ago, jujube, was, domesticated, in, the, indian, subcontinent, by, 9000, bc, barley, and, wheat, cultivation, along, with, the, domestication, of, cattle, primarily, sheep, and, goats, followed, in, mehrgarh, culture, by, 8000, 6000, bc, this, period, also, saw, the, first, domestication, of, the, elephant, pastoral, farming, in, india, included, threshing, planting, crops, in, rows, either, of, two, or, of, six, and, storing, grain, in, granaries, cotton, was, cultivated, by, the, 5th, 4th, millennium, bc, by, the, 5th, millennium, bc, agricultural, communities, became, widespread, in, kashmir, irrigation, was, developed, in, the, indus, valley, civilisation, by, around, 4500, bc, the, size, and, prosperity, of, the, indus, civilization, grew, as, a, result, of, this, innovation, leading, to, more, thoroughly, planned, settlements, which, used, drainage, and, sewers, archeological, evidence, of, an, animal, drawn, plough, dates, back, to, 2500, bc, in, the, indus, valley, civilization, records, from, the, warring, states, qin, dynasty, and, han, dynasty, provide, a, picture, of, early, chinese, agriculture, from, the, 5th, century, bc, to, 2nd, century, ad, which, included, a, nationwide, granary, system, and, widespread, use, of, sericulture, an, important, early, chinese, book, on, agriculture, is, the, qimin, yaoshu, of, ad, 535, written, by, jia, sixie, jia, s, writing, style, was, straightforward, and, lucid, relative, to, the, elaborate, and, allusive, writing, typical, of, the, time, jia, s, book, was, also, very, long, with, over, one, hundred, thousand, written, chinese, characters, and, it, quoted, many, other, chinese, books, that, were, written, previously, but, no, longer, survive, the, contents, of, jia, s, 6th, century, book, include, sections, on, land, preparation, seeding, cultivation, orchard, management, forestry, and, animal, husbandry, the, book, also, includes, peripherally, related, content, covering, trade, and, culinary, uses, for, crops, the, work, and, the, style, in, which, it, was, written, proved, influential, on, later, chinese, agronomists, such, as, wang, zhen, and, his, groundbreaking, nong, shu, of, 1313, for, agricultural, purposes, the, chinese, had, innovated, the, hydraulic, powered, trip, hammer, by, the, 1st, century, bc, although, it, found, other, purposes, its, main, function, to, pound, decorticate, and, polish, grain, that, otherwise, would, have, been, done, manually, the, chinese, also, began, using, the, square, pallet, chain, pump, by, the, 1st, century, ad, powered, by, a, waterwheel, or, oxen, pulling, an, on, a, system, of, mechanical, wheels, although, the, chain, pump, found, use, in, public, works, of, providing, water, for, urban, and, palatial, pipe, systems, it, was, used, largely, to, lift, water, from, a, lower, to, higher, elevation, in, filling, irrigation, canals, and, channels, for, farmland, by, the, end, of, the, han, dynasty, in, the, late, 2nd, century, heavy, ploughs, had, been, developed, with, iron, ploughshares, and, mouldboards, these, slowly, spread, west, revolutionizing, farming, in, northern, europe, by, the, 10th, century, thomas, glick, however, argues, for, a, development, of, the, chinese, plough, as, late, as, the, 9th, century, implying, its, spread, east, from, similar, designs, known, in, italy, by, the, 7th, century, asian, rice, was, domesticated, 8, 200, 13, 500, years, ago, in, china, with, a, single, genetic, origin, from, the, wild, rice, oryza, rufipogon, in, the, pearl, river, valley, region, of, china, rice, cultivation, then, spread, to, south, and, southeast, asia, the, major, cereal, crops, of, the, ancient, mediterranean, region, were, wheat, emmer, and, barley, while, common, vegetables, included, peas, beans, fava, and, olives, dairy, products, came, mostly, from, sheep, and, goats, and, meat, which, was, consumed, on, rare, occasion, for, most, people, usually, consisted, of, pork, beef, and, lamb, agriculture, in, ancient, greece, was, hindered, by, the, topography, of, mainland, greece, that, only, allowed, for, roughly, 10, of, the, land, to, be, cultivated, properly, necessitating, the, specialised, exportation, of, oil, and, wine, and, importation, of, grains, from, thrace, centered, in, what, is, now, bulgaria, and, the, greek, colonies, of, pontic, greeks, near, the, black, sea, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, ptolemaic, empire, controlled, egypt, cyprus, phoenicia, and, cyrenaica, major, grain, producing, regions, that, mainland, greeks, depended, on, for, subsistence, while, the, ptolemaic, grain, market, also, played, a, critical, role, in, the, rise, of, the, roman, republic, in, the, seleucid, empire, mesopotamia, was, a, crucial, area, for, the, production, of, wheat, while, nomadic, animal, husbandry, was, also, practiced, in, other, parts, in, the, greco, roman, world, of, classical, antiquity, roman, agriculture, was, built, on, techniques, originally, pioneered, by, the, sumerians, transmitted, to, them, by, subsequent, cultures, with, a, specific, emphasis, on, the, cultivation, of, crops, for, trade, and, export, the, romans, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, manorial, economic, system, involving, serfdom, which, flourished, in, the, middle, ages, the, farm, sizes, in, rome, can, be, divided, into, three, categories, small, farms, were, from, 18, to, 88, iugera, one, iugerum, is, equal, to, about, 0, 65, acre, medium, sized, farms, were, from, 80, to, 500, iugera, singular, iugerum, large, estates, called, latifundia, were, over, 500, iugera, the, romans, had, four, systems, of, farm, management, direct, work, by, the, owner, and, his, family, slaves, doing, work, under, the, supervision, of, slave, managers, tenant, farming, or, sharecropping, in, which, the, owner, and, a, tenant, divide, up, a, farm, s, produce, and, situations, in, which, a, farm, was, leased, to, a, tenant, agricultural, history, took, a, different, path, from, the, old, world, as, the, americas, lacked, large, seeded, easily, domesticated, grains, such, as, wheat, and, barley, and, large, domestic, animals, that, could, be, used, for, agricultural, labor, rather, than, the, practice, which, developed, in, the, old, world, of, sowing, a, field, with, a, single, crop, pre, historic, american, agriculture, usually, consisted, of, cultivating, many, crops, close, to, each, other, utilizing, only, hand, labor, moreover, agricultural, areas, in, the, americas, lacked, the, uniformity, of, the, east, west, area, of, mediterranean, and, semi, arid, climates, in, southern, europe, and, southwestern, asia, but, instead, had, a, north, south, pattern, with, a, variety, of, different, climatic, zones, in, close, proximity, to, each, other, this, fostered, the, domestication, of, many, different, plants, at, the, time, of, first, contact, between, the, europeans, and, the, americans, the, europeans, practiced, extensive, agriculture, based, on, the, plough, and, draught, animals, with, tenants, under, landlords, but, also, forced, labor, or, slavery, while, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, practiced, intensive, agriculture, based, on, human, labour, europeans, wanted, control, of, land, for, the, grazing, of, their, livestock, and, property, rights, for, the, control, of, production, though, they, were, impressed, with, the, productivity, of, traditional, farming, techniques, they, saw, no, connection, to, their, system, and, were, dismissive, of, native, american, practices, as, gardening, rather, than, a, commercializable, enterprise, due, to, several, thousand, years, of, selective, breeding, maize, the, hemisphere, s, most, important, crop, was, more, productive, than, old, world, grain, crops, maize, produced, two, and, one, half, times, more, calories, per, acre, than, wheat, and, barley, the, earliest, known, areas, of, possible, agriculture, in, the, americas, dating, to, about, 9000, bc, are, in, colombia, near, present, day, pereira, and, by, the, las, vegas, culture, in, ecuador, on, the, santa, elena, peninsula, the, plants, cultivated, or, manipulated, by, humans, were, ler, n, calathea, allouia, arrowroot, maranta, arundinacea, squash, cucurbita, species, and, bottle, gourd, lagenaria, siceraria, all, are, plants, of, humid, climates, and, their, existence, at, this, time, on, the, semi, arid, santa, elena, peninsula, may, be, evidence, that, they, were, transplanted, there, from, more, humid, environments, in, another, study, this, area, of, south, america, was, identified, as, one, of, the, four, oldest, places, of, origin, for, agriculture, along, with, the, fertile, crescent, china, and, mesoamerica, dated, between, 6200, bc, and, 10000, bc, to, facilitate, comprehension, by, readers, radiocarbon, calibrated, bp, dates, in, the, above, sources, have, been, converted, to, bc, in, the, andes, region, with, civilizations, including, the, inca, the, major, crop, was, the, potato, domesticated, between, 8000, and, 5000, bc, coca, still, a, major, crop, to, this, day, was, domesticated, in, the, andes, as, were, the, peanut, tomato, tobacco, and, pineapple, cotton, was, domesticated, in, peru, by, 4200, bc, animals, were, also, domesticated, including, llamas, alpacas, and, guinea, pigs, the, people, of, the, inca, empire, of, south, america, grew, large, surpluses, of, food, which, they, stored, in, buildings, called, qullqas, the, most, important, crop, domesticated, in, the, amazon, basin, and, tropical, lowlands, was, probably, cassava, manihot, esculenta, which, was, domesticated, before, 7000, bce, likely, in, the, rond, nia, and, mato, grosso, states, of, brazil, the, guaitecas, archipelago, in, modern, chile, was, the, southern, limit, of, pre, hispanic, agriculture, near, 44, south, latitude, as, noted, by, the, mention, of, the, cultivation, of, chilo, potatoes, by, a, spanish, expedition, in, 1557, in, mesoamerica, wild, teosinte, was, transformed, through, human, selection, into, the, ancestor, of, modern, maize, about, 7, 000, bc, it, gradually, spread, across, north, america, and, to, south, america, and, was, the, most, important, crop, of, native, americans, at, the, time, of, european, exploration, other, mesoamerican, crops, include, hundreds, of, varieties, of, locally, domesticated, squash, and, beans, while, cocoa, also, domesticated, in, the, region, was, a, major, crop, the, turkey, one, of, the, most, important, poultry, birds, was, probably, domesticated, in, mexico, or, the, u, s, southwest, in, mesoamerica, the, aztecs, were, active, farmers, and, had, an, agriculturally, focused, economy, the, land, around, lake, texcoco, was, fertile, but, not, large, enough, to, produce, the, amount, of, food, needed, for, the, population, of, their, expanding, empire, the, aztecs, developed, irrigation, systems, formed, terraced, hillsides, fertilized, their, soil, and, developed, chinampas, or, artificial, islands, also, known, as, floating, gardens, the, mayas, between, 400, bc, to, 900, ad, used, extensive, canal, and, raised, field, systems, to, farm, swampland, on, the, yucat, n, peninsula, the, indigenous, people, of, the, eastern, u, s, domesticated, numerous, crops, sunflowers, tobacco, varieties, of, squash, and, chenopodium, as, well, as, crops, no, longer, grown, including, marsh, elder, and, little, barley, wild, foods, including, wild, rice, and, maple, sugar, were, harvested, the, domesticated, strawberry, is, a, hybrid, of, a, chilean, and, a, north, american, species, developed, by, breeding, in, europe, and, north, america, two, major, crops, pecans, and, concord, grapes, were, used, extensively, in, prehistoric, times, but, do, not, appear, to, have, been, domesticated, until, the, 19th, century, the, indigenous, people, in, what, is, now, california, and, the, pacific, northwest, practiced, various, forms, of, forest, gardening, and, fire, stick, farming, in, the, forests, grasslands, mixed, woodlands, and, wetlands, ensuring, that, desired, food, and, medicine, plants, continued, to, be, available, the, natives, controlled, fire, on, a, regional, scale, to, create, a, low, intensity, fire, ecology, which, prevented, larger, catastrophic, fires, and, sustained, a, low, density, agriculture, in, loose, rotation, a, sort, of, wild, permaculture, a, system, of, companion, planting, called, the, three, sisters, was, developed, in, north, america, three, crops, that, complemented, each, other, were, planted, together, winter, squash, maize, corn, and, climbing, beans, typically, tepary, beans, or, common, beans, the, maize, provides, a, structure, for, the, beans, to, climb, eliminating, the, need, for, poles, the, beans, provide, the, nitrogen, to, the, soil, that, the, other, plants, use, and, the, squash, spreads, along, the, ground, blocking, the, sunlight, helping, prevent, the, establishment, of, weeds, the, squash, leaves, also, act, as, a, living, mulch, in, the, sahel, region, civilizations, such, as, the, mali, and, songhai, empires, cultivated, sorghum, and, pearl, millet, which, were, domesticated, between, 3000, and, 2500, bc, the, donkey, was, domesticated, in, nubia, at, approximately, 5000, bc, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, sanga, cattle, may, have, been, independently, domesticated, in, east, africa, at, around, 1600, bc, in, the, tropical, region, of, west, africa, crops, such, as, black, eyed, peas, sea, island, red, peas, yams, kola, nuts, jollof, rice, and, kokoro, were, domesticated, between, 3000, and, 1000, bc, the, coastal, region, of, west, africa, is, often, referred, to, as, the, yam, belt, due, to, its, high, production, of, yams, the, guineafowl, is, a, poultry, bird, that, was, domesticated, in, west, africa, and, while, the, time, of, the, guineafowl, s, domestication, remains, unclear, there, is, evidence, that, it, was, present, in, ancient, greece, during, the, 5th, century, bc, several, species, of, coffee, were, also, domesticated, throughout, sub, saharan, africa, with, coffea, arabica, originating, in, ethiopia, and, serving, as, the, main, production, of, modern, day, coffee, since, the, late, 15th, century, indigenous, australians, were, predominately, nomadic, hunter, gatherers, due, to, the, policy, of, terra, nullius, aboriginals, were, regarded, as, not, having, been, capable, of, sustained, agriculture, however, the, current, consensus, is, that, various, agricultural, methods, were, employed, by, the, indigenous, people, in, two, regions, of, central, australia, the, central, west, coast, and, eastern, central, australia, forms, of, agriculture, were, practiced, people, living, in, permanent, settlements, of, over, 200, residents, sowed, or, planted, on, a, large, scale, and, stored, the, harvested, food, the, nhanda, and, amangu, of, the, central, west, coast, grew, yams, dioscorea, hastifolia, while, various, groups, in, eastern, central, australia, the, corners, region, planted, and, harvested, bush, onions, yaua, cyperus, bulbosus, native, millet, cooly, tindil, panicum, decompositum, and, a, sporocarp, ngardu, marsilea, drummondii, 281, 304, indigenous, australians, used, systematic, burning, fire, stick, farming, to, enhance, natural, productivity, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, archaeological, research, in, south, west, victoria, established, that, the, gunditjmara, and, other, groups, had, developed, sophisticated, eel, farming, and, fish, trapping, systems, over, a, period, of, nearly, 5, 000, years, the, archaeologist, harry, lourandos, suggested, in, the, 1980s, that, there, was, evidence, of, intensification, in, progress, across, australia, a, process, that, appeared, to, have, continued, through, the, preceding, 5, 000, years, these, concepts, led, the, historian, bill, gammage, to, argue, that, in, effect, the, whole, continent, was, a, managed, landscape, torres, strait, islanders, are, now, known, to, have, planted, bananas, in, new, guinea, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, agriculture, independently, emerged, around, 7, 000, years, ago, with, the, domestication, of, crops, such, as, bananas, and, taro, pigs, and, chickens, were, imported, to, new, guinea, which, were, later, innovated, by, other, pacific, island, nations, such, as, those, in, polynesia, the, middle, ages, saw, further, improvements, in, agriculture, monasteries, spread, throughout, europe, and, became, important, centers, for, the, collection, of, knowledge, related, to, agriculture, and, forestry, the, manorial, system, allowed, large, landowners, to, control, their, land, and, its, laborers, in, the, form, of, peasants, or, serfs, during, the, medieval, period, the, arab, world, was, critical, in, the, exchange, of, crops, and, technology, between, the, european, asia, and, african, continents, besides, transporting, numerous, crops, they, introduced, the, concept, of, summer, irrigation, to, europe, and, developed, the, beginnings, of, the, plantation, system, of, sugarcane, growing, through, the, use, of, slaves, for, intensive, cultivation, by, ad, 900, developments, in, iron, smelting, allowed, for, increased, production, in, europe, leading, to, developments, in, the, production, of, agricultural, implements, such, as, ploughs, hand, tools, and, horse, shoes, the, carruca, heavy, plough, improved, on, the, earlier, scratch, plough, with, the, adoption, of, the, chinese, mouldboard, plough, to, turn, over, the, heavy, wet, soils, of, northern, europe, this, led, to, the, clearing, of, northern, european, forests, and, an, increase, in, agricultural, production, which, in, turn, led, to, an, increase, in, population, at, the, same, time, some, farmers, in, europe, moved, from, a, two, field, crop, rotation, to, a, three, field, crop, rotation, in, which, one, field, of, three, was, left, fallow, every, year, this, resulted, in, increased, productivity, and, nutrition, as, the, change, in, rotations, permitted, nitrogen, fixing, legumes, such, as, peas, lentils, and, beans, improved, horse, harnesses, and, the, whippletree, further, improved, cultivation, watermills, were, introduced, by, the, romans, but, were, improved, throughout, the, middle, ages, along, with, windmills, and, used, to, grind, grains, into, flour, to, cut, wood, and, to, process, flax, and, wool, crops, included, wheat, rye, barley, and, oats, peas, beans, and, vetches, became, common, from, the, 13th, century, onward, as, a, fodder, crop, for, animals, and, also, for, their, nitrogen, fixation, fertilizing, properties, crop, yields, peaked, in, the, 13th, century, and, stayed, more, or, less, steady, until, the, 18th, century, though, the, limitations, of, medieval, farming, were, once, thought, to, have, provided, a, ceiling, for, the, population, growth, in, the, middle, ages, recent, studies, have, shown, that, the, technology, of, medieval, agriculture, was, always, sufficient, for, the, needs, of, the, people, under, normal, circumstances, and, that, it, was, only, during, exceptionally, harsh, times, such, as, the, terrible, weather, of, 1315, 17, that, the, needs, of, the, population, could, not, be, met, from, the, 8th, century, to, the, 14th, century, the, islamic, world, underwent, a, transformation, in, agricultural, practice, described, by, the, historian, andrew, watson, as, the, arab, agricultural, revolution, this, transformation, was, driven, by, a, number, of, factors, including, the, diffusion, of, many, crops, and, plants, along, muslim, trade, routes, the, spread, of, more, advanced, farming, techniques, and, an, agricultural, economic, system, which, promoted, increased, yields, and, efficiency, the, shift, in, agricultural, practice, changed, the, economy, population, distribution, vegetation, cover, agricultural, production, population, levels, urban, growth, the, distribution, of, the, labour, force, cooking, diet, and, clothing, across, the, islamic, world, muslim, traders, covered, much, of, the, old, world, and, trade, enabled, the, diffusion, of, many, crops, plants, and, farming, techniques, across, the, region, as, well, as, the, adaptation, of, crops, plants, and, techniques, from, beyond, the, islamic, world, this, diffusion, introduced, major, crops, to, europe, by, way, of, al, andalus, along, with, the, techniques, for, their, cultivation, and, cuisine, sugar, cane, rice, and, cotton, were, among, the, major, crops, transferred, along, with, citrus, and, other, fruit, trees, nut, trees, vegetables, such, as, aubergine, spinach, and, chard, and, the, use, of, imported, spices, such, as, cumin, coriander, nutmeg, and, cinnamon, intensive, irrigation, crop, rotation, and, agricultural, manuals, were, widely, adopted, irrigation, partly, based, on, roman, technology, made, use, of, noria, water, wheels, water, mills, dams, and, reservoirs, after, 1492, a, global, exchange, of, previously, local, crops, and, livestock, breeds, occurred, maize, potatoes, sweet, potatoes, and, manioc, were, the, key, crops, that, spread, from, the, new, world, to, the, old, while, varieties, of, wheat, barley, rice, and, turnips, traveled, from, the, old, world, to, the, new, there, had, been, few, livestock, species, in, the, new, world, with, horses, cattle, sheep, and, goats, being, completely, unknown, before, their, arrival, with, old, world, settlers, crops, moving, in, both, directions, across, the, atlantic, ocean, caused, population, growth, around, the, world, and, a, lasting, effect, on, many, cultures, in, the, early, modern, period, maize, and, cassava, were, introduced, from, brazil, into, africa, by, portuguese, traders, in, the, 16th, century, becoming, staple, foods, replacing, native, african, crops, after, its, introduction, from, south, america, to, spain, in, the, late, 1500s, the, potato, became, a, staple, crop, throughout, europe, by, the, late, 1700s, the, potato, allowed, farmers, to, produce, more, food, and, initially, added, variety, to, the, european, diet, the, increased, supply, of, food, reduced, disease, increased, births, and, reduced, mortality, causing, a, population, boom, throughout, the, british, empire, the, us, and, europe, the, introduction, of, the, potato, also, brought, about, the, first, intensive, use, of, fertilizer, in, the, form, of, guano, imported, to, europe, from, peru, and, the, first, artificial, pesticide, in, the, form, of, an, arsenic, compound, used, to, fight, colorado, potato, beetles, before, the, adoption, of, the, potato, as, a, major, crop, the, dependence, on, grain, had, caused, repetitive, regional, and, national, famines, when, the, crops, failed, including, 17, major, famines, in, england, between, 1523, and, 1623, the, resulting, dependence, on, the, potato, however, caused, the, european, potato, failure, a, disastrous, crop, failure, from, disease, that, resulted, in, widespread, famine, and, the, death, of, over, one, million, people, in, ireland, alone, between, the, 17th, century, and, the, mid, 19th, century, britain, saw, a, large, increase, in, agricultural, productivity, and, net, output, new, agricultural, practices, like, enclosure, mechanization, four, field, crop, rotation, to, maintain, soil, nutrients, and, selective, breeding, enabled, an, unprecedented, population, growth, to, 5, 7, million, in, 1750, freeing, up, a, significant, percentage, of, the, workforce, and, thereby, helped, drive, the, industrial, revolution, the, productivity, of, wheat, went, up, from, 19, us, bushels, 670, l, 150, us, dry, gal, 150, imp, gal, per, acre, in, 1720, to, around, 30, us, bushels, 1, 100, l, 240, us, dry, gal, 230, imp, gal, by, 1840, marking, a, major, turning, point, in, history, advice, on, more, productive, techniques, for, farming, began, to, appear, in, england, in, the, mid, 17th, century, from, writers, such, as, samuel, hartlib, walter, blith, and, others, the, main, problem, in, sustaining, agriculture, in, one, place, for, a, long, time, was, the, depletion, of, nutrients, most, importantly, nitrogen, levels, in, the, soil, to, allow, the, soil, to, regenerate, productive, land, was, often, let, fallow, and, in, some, places, crop, rotation, was, used, the, dutch, four, field, rotation, system, was, popularised, by, the, british, agriculturist, charles, townshend, in, the, 18th, century, the, system, wheat, turnips, barley, and, clover, opened, up, a, fodder, crop, and, grazing, crop, allowing, livestock, to, be, bred, year, round, the, use, of, clover, was, especially, important, as, the, legume, roots, replenished, soil, nitrates, the, mechanisation, and, rationalisation, of, agriculture, was, another, important, factor, robert, bakewell, and, thomas, coke, introduced, selective, breeding, and, initiated, a, process, of, inbreeding, to, maximise, desirable, traits, from, the, mid, 18th, century, such, as, the, new, leicester, sheep, machines, were, invented, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, various, agricultural, operation, such, as, jethro, tull, s, seed, drill, of, 1701, that, mechanised, seeding, at, the, correct, depth, and, spacing, and, andrew, meikle, s, threshing, machine, of, 1784, ploughs, were, steadily, improved, from, joseph, foljambe, s, rotherham, iron, plough, in, 1730, to, james, small, s, improved, scots, plough, metal, in, 1763, in, 1789, ransomes, sims, jefferies, was, producing, 86, plough, models, for, different, soils, powered, farm, machinery, began, with, richard, trevithick, s, stationary, steam, engine, used, to, drive, a, threshing, machine, in, 1812, mechanisation, spread, to, additional, farm, uses, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, first, petrol, driven, tractor, was, built, in, america, by, john, froelich, in, 1892, john, bennet, lawes, began, the, scientific, investigation, of, fertilization, at, the, rothamsted, experimental, station, in, 1843, he, investigated, the, impact, of, inorganic, and, organic, fertilizers, on, crop, yield, and, founded, one, of, the, first, artificial, fertilizer, manufacturing, factories, in, 1842, fertilizer, in, the, shape, of, sodium, nitrate, deposits, in, chile, was, imported, to, britain, by, john, thomas, north, as, well, as, guano, birds, droppings, the, first, commercial, process, for, fertilizer, production, was, the, obtaining, of, phosphate, from, the, dissolution, of, coprolites, in, sulphuric, acid, dan, albone, constructed, the, first, commercially, successful, gasoline, powered, general, purpose, tractor, in, 1901, and, the, 1923, international, harvester, farmall, tractor, marked, a, major, point, in, the, replacement, of, draft, animals, particularly, horses, with, machines, since, that, time, self, propelled, mechanical, harvesters, combines, planters, transplanters, and, other, equipment, have, been, developed, further, revolutionizing, agriculture, these, inventions, allowed, farming, tasks, to, be, done, with, a, speed, and, on, a, scale, previously, impossible, leading, modern, farms, to, output, much, greater, volumes, of, high, quality, produce, per, land, unit, the, haber, bosch, method, for, synthesizing, ammonium, nitrate, represented, a, major, breakthrough, and, allowed, crop, yields, to, overcome, previous, constraints, it, was, first, patented, by, german, chemist, fritz, haber, in, 1910, carl, bosch, while, working, for, german, chemical, company, basf, successfully, commercialized, the, process, and, secured, further, patents, in, the, years, after, world, war, ii, the, use, of, synthetic, fertilizer, increased, rapidly, in, sync, with, the, increasing, world, population, collective, farming, was, widely, practiced, in, the, soviet, union, the, eastern, bloc, countries, china, and, vietnam, starting, in, the, 1930s, in, the, soviet, union, one, result, was, the, soviet, famine, of, 1932, 33, another, consequence, occurred, during, the, great, leap, forward, in, china, initiated, by, mao, tse, tung, that, resulted, in, the, great, chinese, famine, from, 1959, to, 1961, and, ultimately, reshaped, the, thinking, of, deng, xiaoping, in, the, past, century, agriculture, has, been, characterized, by, increased, productivity, the, substitution, of, synthetic, fertilizers, and, pesticides, for, labour, water, pollution, and, farm, subsidies, other, applications, of, scientific, research, since, 1950, in, agriculture, include, gene, manipulation, hydroponics, and, the, development, of, economically, viable, biofuels, such, as, ethanol, the, number, of, people, involved, in, farming, in, industrial, countries, fell, radically, from, 24, percent, of, the, american, population, to, 1, 5, percent, in, 2002, the, number, of, farms, also, decreased, and, their, ownership, became, more, concentrated, for, example, between, 1967, and, 2002, one, million, pig, farms, in, america, consolidated, into, 114, 000, with, 80, percent, of, the, production, on, factory, farms, according, to, the, worldwatch, institute, 74, percent, of, the, world, s, poultry, 43, percent, of, beef, and, 68, percent, of, eggs, are, produced, this, way, famines, however, continued, to, sweep, the, globe, through, the, 20th, century, through, the, effects, of, climatic, events, government, policy, war, and, crop, failure, millions, of, people, died, in, each, of, at, least, ten, famines, between, the, 1920s, and, the, 1990s, the, green, revolution, was, a, series, of, research, development, and, technology, transfer, initiatives, between, the, 1940s, and, the, late, 1970s, it, increased, agriculture, production, around, the, world, especially, from, the, late, 1960s, the, initiatives, led, by, norman, borlaug, and, credited, with, saving, over, a, billion, people, from, starvation, involved, the, development, of, high, yielding, varieties, of, cereal, grains, expansion, of, irrigation, infrastructure, modernization, of, management, techniques, distribution, of, hybridized, seeds, synthetic, fertilizers, and, pesticides, to, farmers, synthetic, nitrogen, along, with, mined, rock, phosphate, pesticides, and, mechanization, have, greatly, increased, crop, yields, in, the, early, 20th, century, increased, supply, of, grains, has, led, to, cheaper, livestock, as, well, further, global, yield, increases, were, experienced, later, in, the, 20th, century, when, high, yield, varieties, of, common, staple, grains, such, as, rice, wheat, and, corn, were, introduced, as, a, part, of, the, green, revolution, the, green, revolution, exported, the, technologies, including, pesticides, and, synthetic, nitrogen, of, the, developed, world, to, the, developing, world, thomas, malthus, famously, predicted, that, the, earth, would, not, be, able, to, support, its, growing, population, but, technologies, such, as, the, green, revolution, have, allowed, the, world, to, produce, a, surplus, of, food, although, the, green, revolution, at, first, significantly, increased, rice, yields, in, asia, yield, then, levelled, off, the, genetic, yield, potential, has, increased, for, wheat, but, the, yield, potential, for, rice, has, not, increased, since, 1966, and, the, yield, potential, for, maize, has, barely, increased, in, 35, years, it, takes, only, a, decade, or, two, for, herbicide, resistant, weeds, to, emerge, and, insects, become, resistant, to, insecticides, within, about, a, decade, delayed, somewhat, by, crop, rotation, for, most, of, its, history, agriculture, has, been, organic, without, synthetic, fertilisers, or, pesticides, and, without, gmos, with, the, advent, of, chemical, agriculture, rudolf, steiner, called, for, farming, without, synthetic, pesticides, and, his, agriculture, course, of, 1924, laid, the, foundation, for, biodynamic, agriculture, lord, northbourne, developed, these, ideas, and, presented, his, manifesto, of, organic, farming, in, 1940, this, became, a, worldwide, movement, and, organic, farming, is, now, practiced, in, many, countries
