the, history, of, greece, encompasses, the, history, of, the, territory, of, the, modern, nation, state, of, greece, as, well, as, that, of, the, greek, people, and, the, areas, they, inhabited, and, ruled, historically, the, scope, of, greek, habitation, and, rule, has, varied, throughout, the, ages, and, as, a, result, the, history, of, greece, is, similarly, elastic, in, what, it, includes, generally, the, history, of, greece, is, divided, into, the, following, periods, at, its, cultural, and, geographical, peak, greek, civilization, spread, from, egypt, all, the, way, to, the, hindu, kush, mountains, in, afghanistan, since, then, greek, minorities, have, continued, to, inhabit, former, greek, territories, e, g, turkey, albania, italy, libya, levant, armenia, georgia, and, greek, emigrants, have, assimilated, into, differing, societies, across, the, globe, e, g, north, america, australia, northern, europe, south, africa, at, present, most, greeks, live, in, the, modern, states, of, greece, independent, since, 1821, and, cyprus, fossils, of, one, of, the, earliest, pre, humans, ouranopithecus, macedoniensis, 9, 6, 8, 7, million, years, ago, and, of, quite, possibly, the, oldest, direct, ancestor, of, all, humans, graecopithecus, 7, 2, million, years, ago, were, found, in, greece, in, addition, 5, 7, million, year, old, footprints, were, found, on, the, greek, island, of, crete, which, may, suggest, hominin, evolution, outside, of, africa, contrary, to, current, hypotheses, the, paleolithic, period, is, generally, understudied, in, greece, because, research, has, traditionally, focused, on, the, later, parts, of, prehistory, neolithic, bronze, age, and, the, classical, times, nevertheless, significant, advances, have, been, achieved, over, recent, years, and, the, archaeological, record, has, been, enriched, with, new, material, collected, mostly, in, the, framework, of, regional, surveys, but, also, through, systematic, or, rescue, excavations, new, caves, and, rock, shelters, as, well, as, recently, discovered, and, important, open, air, sites, are, now, being, excavated, the, earliest, traces, of, human, habitation, in, present, day, greece, were, discovered, in, arcadia, peloponnesus, and, date, back, 700, 000, years, the, apidima, cave, in, mani, southern, greece, contains, the, oldest, known, remains, of, anatomically, modern, humans, outside, of, africa, dated, to, 210, 000, years, ago, currently, known, anthropological, and, archaeological, finds, allow, the, division, of, the, paleolithic, in, the, greek, area, into, lower, 350, 000, 100, 000, bp, middle, 100, 000, 35, 000, bp, and, upper, palaeolithic, 35, 000, 11, 000, bp, there, are, to, date, few, sites, of, the, lower, paleolithic, whereas, there, are, more, of, the, middle, and, upper, this, is, partly, due, to, the, intense, tectonic, activity, in, the, greek, area, and, the, rise, and, fall, of, the, aegean, sea, which, destroyed, every, trace, of, habitation, from, some, geographical, regions, paleolithic, finds, from, greece, were, first, reported, in, 1867, but, the, first, organized, research, on, the, sites, was, conducted, many, years, later, between, 1927, and, 1931, by, the, austrian, archaeologist, adalbert, markovits, the, first, excavation, of, a, paleolithic, site, took, place, in, 1942, at, seidi, cave, in, boeotia, by, the, german, archaeologist, rudolf, stampfuss, more, systematic, research, however, was, conducted, during, the, 1960s, in, epirus, macedonia, thessaly, and, the, peloponnese, by, english, american, and, german, research, groups, the, mesolithic, in, greece, occurred, between, the, upper, paleolithic, and, the, neolithic, mesolithic, sites, in, greece, were, limited, and, the, majority, are, located, near, the, coast, franchthi, cave, the, kalamakia, cave, in, mani, peloponnese, the, asprochaliko, cave, in, epirus, where, the, first, excavation, took, place, in, 1960, and, the, theopetra, cave, are, among, the, most, important, mesolithic, sites, in, greece, and, southeast, europe, and, were, inhabited, almost, continuously, throughout, the, paleolithic, and, the, mesolithic, period, the, neolithic, revolution, reached, europe, beginning, in, 7000, 6500, bc, when, agriculturalists, from, the, near, east, entered, the, greek, peninsula, from, anatolia, by, island, hopping, through, the, aegean, sea, the, earliest, known, neolithic, sites, with, developed, agricultural, economies, in, europe, dated, 8500, 9000, bp, were, found, in, greece, the, first, greek, speaking, tribes, speaking, the, predecessor, of, the, mycenaean, language, arrived, in, the, greek, mainland, sometime, in, the, neolithic, period, or, the, early, bronze, age, c, 3200, bc, the, cycladic, culture, is, a, significant, late, neolithic, and, early, bronze, age, material, culture, from, the, cyclades, best, known, for, its, schematic, flat, female, idols, carved, out, of, the, islands, pure, white, marble, the, middle, bronze, age, minoan, civilization, in, crete, lasted, from, c, 3000, c, 1400, bc, little, specific, information, is, known, about, the, minoans, including, their, written, system, which, was, recorded, with, the, undeciphered, linear, a, script, and, cretan, hieroglyphs, even, the, name, minoans, is, a, modern, appellation, derived, from, minos, the, legendary, king, of, crete, they, were, primarily, a, mercantile, people, engaged, in, extensive, overseas, trade, throughout, the, mediterranean, region, minoan, civilization, was, affected, by, a, number, of, natural, cataclysms, such, as, the, volcanic, eruption, at, thera, c, 1628, 1627, bc, and, earthquakes, c, 1600, bc, in, 1425, bc, all, the, minoan, palaces, except, knossos, were, devastated, by, fire, which, allowed, the, mycenaean, greeks, influenced, by, the, minoans, culture, to, expand, into, crete, remains, of, the, minoan, civilization, which, preceded, the, mycenaean, civilization, on, crete, were, first, discovered, in, the, modern, era, by, sir, arthur, evans, in, 1900, when, he, purchased, and, began, excavating, the, site, at, knossos, pre, mycenean, helladic, period, following, the, end, of, the, neolithic, the, last, stone, age, period, the, early, and, middle, helladic, periods, were, established, on, the, greek, mainland, the, slow, transition, from, the, final, neolithic, period, took, place, with, the, eutresis, culture, c, 3200, c, 2650, bc, over, hundreds, of, years, agricultural, communities, transitioned, from, stone, tools, to, metal, ones, following, such, materialistic, developments, more, powerful, micro, states, and, the, base, of, the, future, mycenean, civilization, were, developed, early, bronze, age, settlements, saw, further, development, during, helladic, iii, exemplified, by, the, tiryns, culture, c, 2200, c, 2000, bc, and, the, middle, helladic, period, before, the, mycenean, period, discussed, below, mycenaean, civilization, originated, and, evolved, from, the, society, and, culture, of, the, early, and, middle, helladic, periods, in, mainland, greece, it, emerged, c, 1600, bc, when, helladic, culture, was, transformed, under, influences, from, minoan, crete, and, it, lasted, until, the, collapse, of, the, mycenaean, palaces, c, 1100, bc, mycenaean, greece, is, the, late, helladic, bronze, age, civilization, of, ancient, greece, and, it, formed, the, historical, setting, of, the, epics, of, homer, and, most, of, greek, mythology, and, religion, the, mycenaean, period, takes, its, name, from, the, archaeological, site, mycenae, in, the, northeastern, argolid, in, the, peloponnesos, of, southern, greece, athens, pylos, thebes, and, tiryns, also, have, important, mycenaean, sites, mycenaean, civilization, was, dominated, by, a, warrior, aristocracy, around, 1400, bc, the, mycenaeans, extended, their, control, to, crete, the, center, of, the, minoan, civilization, and, adopted, a, form, of, the, minoan, script, linear, a, to, write, an, early, form, of, greek, the, mycenaean, era, script, is, called, linear, b, which, was, deciphered, in, 1952, by, michael, ventris, the, mycenaeans, buried, their, nobles, in, beehive, tombs, tholoi, large, circular, burial, chambers, with, a, high, vaulted, roof, and, straight, entry, passage, lined, with, stone, they, often, buried, daggers, or, some, other, form, of, military, equipment, with, the, deceased, nobility, was, also, often, buried, with, gold, masks, tiaras, armor, and, jeweled, weapons, mycenaeans, were, buried, in, a, sitting, position, and, some, of, the, nobility, underwent, mummification, around, 1100, 1050, bc, the, mycenaean, civilization, collapsed, numerous, cities, were, sacked, and, the, region, entered, what, historians, see, as, a, dark, age, during, this, period, greece, experienced, a, decline, in, population, and, literacy, the, greeks, themselves, have, traditionally, blamed, this, decline, on, an, invasion, by, another, wave, of, greek, people, the, dorians, although, there, is, scant, archaeological, evidence, for, this, view, ancient, greece, refers, to, a, period, of, greek, history, that, lasted, from, the, greek, dark, ages, c, 1050, c, 750, bc, to, the, end, of, antiquity, c, ad, 600, in, common, usage, it, can, refer, to, all, greek, history, before, or, including, the, roman, empire, but, historians, tend, use, the, term, more, precisely, some, include, the, periods, of, the, minoan, and, mycenaean, civilizations, while, others, argue, that, these, civilizations, were, so, different, from, later, greek, cultures, that, they, should, be, classed, separately, traditionally, the, ancient, greek, period, was, taken, to, begin, with, the, date, of, the, first, olympic, games, in, 776, bc, but, most, historians, now, extend, the, term, back, to, about, 1000, bc, toward, the, beginning, of, the, greek, dark, ages, the, greek, dark, ages, are, succeeded, by, the, archaic, period, which, began, c, 800, bc, and, lasted, until, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, in, 480, bc, it, was, during, this, period, that, the, greek, alphabet, and, early, greek, literature, developed, as, well, as, the, poleis, city, states, of, ancient, greece, with, the, end, of, the, dark, ages, greeks, spread, to, the, shores, of, the, black, sea, southern, italy, the, so, called, magna, graecia, and, asia, minor, the, classical, period, began, during, the, greco, persian, wars, in, the, 5th, century, bc, and, was, marked, by, increased, autonomy, from, the, persian, empire, as, well, as, the, flourishing, of, ancient, greek, democracy, art, theater, literature, and, philosophy, the, traditional, date, for, the, end, of, the, classical, greek, period, is, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bc, and, the, period, that, follows, is, termed, the, hellenistic, ending, with, the, rise, of, the, roman, empire, at, the, end, of, the, first, millennium, bc, not, everyone, treats, the, classical, greek, and, hellenic, periods, as, distinct, some, writers, treat, the, ancient, greek, civilization, as, a, continuum, running, until, the, proliferation, of, christianity, in, the, 3rd, century, ancient, greece, is, considered, by, many, historians, to, be, the, foundational, culture, of, western, civilization, greek, culture, was, a, powerful, influence, in, the, roman, empire, which, carried, a, version, of, it, to, many, parts, of, europe, ancient, greek, civilization, has, been, immensely, influential, on, the, language, politics, educational, systems, philosophy, art, and, architecture, of, the, modern, world, particularly, during, the, renaissance, in, western, europe, and, again, during, various, neo, classical, revivals, in, 18th, and, 19th, century, europe, and, the, americas, the, greek, dark, ages, c, 1100, c, 800, bc, refers, to, the, period, of, greek, history, from, the, presumed, dorian, invasion, and, end, of, the, mycenaean, civilization, in, the, 11th, century, bc, to, the, rise, of, the, first, greek, city, states, in, the, 9th, century, bc, and, the, epics, of, homer, and, earliest, writings, in, the, greek, alphabet, in, the, 8th, century, bc, the, collapse, of, the, mycenaean, civilization, coincided, with, the, fall, of, several, other, large, empires, in, the, near, east, most, notably, the, hittite, and, the, egyptian, the, cause, is, still, somewhat, mysterious, but, has, often, been, attributed, to, the, invasion, of, hypothesized, sea, peoples, wielding, iron, weapons, a, hypothesized, dorian, invasion, may, have, also, contributed, as, asserted, by, ancient, greek, legend, but, unsubstantiated, by, the, archaeological, record, legend, asserts, that, dorians, migrated, down, into, greece, equipped, with, superior, iron, weapons, colonizing, and, easily, dispersing, the, already, weakened, mycenaeans, the, period, that, follows, these, events, is, collectively, known, as, the, greek, dark, ages, kings, ruled, throughout, this, period, until, eventually, they, were, replaced, with, an, aristocracy, then, still, later, in, some, areas, an, aristocracy, within, an, aristocracy, an, elite, of, the, elite, warfare, shifted, from, a, focus, on, the, cavalry, to, a, great, emphasis, on, infantry, due, to, its, cheapness, of, production, and, local, availability, iron, replaced, bronze, as, the, metal, of, choice, in, the, manufacturing, of, tools, and, weapons, slowly, however, equality, grew, among, the, different, sects, of, people, leading, to, the, dethronement, of, the, various, kings, and, the, rise, of, the, family, at, the, end, of, this, period, of, stagnation, the, greek, civilization, was, engulfed, in, a, renaissance, that, spread, throughout, the, greek, world, as, far, as, the, black, sea, and, spain, writing, was, relearned, from, the, phoenicians, eventually, spreading, north, into, italy, and, the, gauls, in, the, 8th, century, bc, greece, began, to, emerge, from, the, dark, ages, which, followed, the, fall, of, the, mycenaean, civilization, literacy, had, been, lost, and, mycenaean, script, forgotten, but, the, greeks, adopted, the, phoenician, alphabet, modifying, it, to, create, the, greek, alphabet, from, about, the, 9th, century, bc, written, records, begin, to, appear, greece, was, divided, into, many, small, self, governing, communities, a, pattern, largely, dictated, by, greek, geography, where, every, island, valley, and, plain, is, cut, off, from, its, neighbors, by, the, sea, or, mountain, ranges, the, archaic, period, can, be, understood, as, the, orientalizing, period, when, greece, was, at, the, fringe, but, not, under, the, sway, of, the, budding, neo, assyrian, empire, greece, adopted, significant, amounts, of, cultural, elements, from, the, orient, in, art, as, well, as, in, religion, and, mythology, archaeologically, archaic, greece, is, marked, by, geometric, pottery, the, basic, unit, of, politics, in, ancient, greece, was, the, polis, greek, sometimes, translated, as, city, state, the, term, lends, itself, to, the, modern, english, word, politics, which, literally, means, the, things, of, the, polis, at, least, in, theory, each, polis, was, politically, independent, however, some, poleis, were, subordinate, to, others, e, g, a, colony, traditionally, deferred, to, its, mother, city, and, some, had, governments, wholly, dependent, upon, others, e, g, the, thirty, tyrants, in, athens, was, imposed, by, sparta, following, the, peloponnesian, war, but, the, titularly, supreme, power, in, each, polis, was, located, within, that, city, this, meant, that, when, greece, went, to, war, e, g, against, the, persian, empire, it, took, the, form, of, an, alliance, going, to, war, it, also, gave, ample, opportunity, for, wars, within, greece, between, different, poleis, two, major, wars, shaped, the, classical, greek, world, the, first, was, the, persian, wars, 499, 449, bc, recounted, in, the, greek, historian, herodotus, s, histories, by, the, late, 6th, century, bc, the, achaemenid, persian, empire, ruled, over, all, greek, city, states, in, ionia, the, western, coast, of, modern, day, turkey, and, had, made, territorial, gains, in, the, balkans, and, eastern, europe, proper, as, well, in, 499, bc, the, greek, cities, of, ionia, led, by, miletus, revolted, against, the, persian, empire, and, were, supported, by, some, mainland, cities, including, athens, and, eretria, after, the, uprising, had, been, quelled, darius, i, launched, the, first, persian, invasion, of, greece, to, exact, revenge, on, the, mainland, greeks, in, 492, bc, persian, general, mardonius, led, an, army, supported, by, a, fleet, across, the, hellespont, re, subjugating, thrace, and, adding, macedonia, as, a, fully, subjugated, client, kingdom, however, before, he, could, reach, greece, proper, his, fleet, was, destroyed, in, a, storm, near, mount, athos, in, 490, bc, darius, sent, another, fleet, directly, across, the, aegean, sea, rather, than, following, the, land, route, as, mardonius, had, done, to, subdue, athens, after, destroying, the, city, of, eretria, the, fleet, landed, and, faced, the, athenian, army, at, marathon, which, ended, in, a, decisive, athenian, victory, darius, s, successor, xerxes, i, launched, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, in, 480, bc, despite, greek, defeat, at, thermopylae, after, which, the, persians, briefly, overran, northern, and, central, greece, the, greek, city, states, once, again, managed, to, comprehensively, defeat, the, invaders, with, naval, victory, at, salamis, and, victory, on, land, at, plataea, to, prosecute, the, war, and, then, to, defend, greece, from, further, persian, attack, athens, founded, the, delian, league, in, 477, bc, initially, each, city, in, the, league, would, contribute, ships, and, soldiers, to, a, common, army, but, in, time, athens, allowed, and, then, compelled, the, smaller, cities, to, contribute, funds, so, that, it, could, supply, their, quota, of, ships, secession, from, the, league, could, be, punished, following, military, reversals, against, the, persians, the, treasury, was, moved, from, delos, to, athens, further, strengthening, the, latter, s, control, over, the, league, the, delian, league, was, eventually, referred, to, pejoratively, as, the, athenian, empire, in, 458, bc, while, the, persian, wars, were, still, ongoing, war, broke, out, between, the, delian, league, and, the, peloponnesian, league, comprising, sparta, and, its, allies, after, some, inconclusive, fighting, the, two, sides, signed, a, peace, treaty, in, 447, bc, that, peace, was, stipulated, to, last, thirty, years, instead, it, held, only, until, 431, bc, with, the, onset, of, the, peloponnesian, war, the, main, sources, concerning, the, peloponnesian, war, 431, 404, bc, are, thucydides, s, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, and, xenophon, s, hellenica, both, historians, were, also, athenian, generals, who, lived, through, the, war, the, war, began, in, 431, bc, over, a, dispute, between, the, cities, of, corcyra, and, epidamnus, corinth, an, ally, of, sparta, in, the, peloponnesian, league, intervened, on, the, epidamnian, side, fearful, lest, corinth, capture, the, corcyran, navy, second, only, to, the, athenian, in, size, athens, intervened, they, prevented, corinth, from, landing, on, corcyra, at, the, battle, of, sybota, laid, siege, to, potidaea, and, forbade, all, commerce, with, corinth, s, closely, situated, ally, megara, with, the, megarian, decree, there, was, disagreement, among, the, greeks, as, to, which, party, violated, the, treaty, between, the, delian, and, peloponnesian, leagues, as, athens, was, technically, defending, a, new, ally, the, corinthians, turned, to, sparta, for, aid, fearing, the, growing, might, of, athens, and, witnessing, athens, willingness, to, use, it, against, the, megarians, the, embargo, would, have, ruined, them, sparta, declared, the, treaty, violated, and, the, peloponnesian, war, began, in, earnest, the, first, stage, of, the, war, known, as, the, archidamian, war, for, the, spartan, king, archidamus, ii, lasted, until, 421, bc, with, the, signing, of, the, peace, of, nicias, it, began, with, the, athenian, general, pericles, recommending, that, his, city, fight, a, defensive, war, avoiding, battle, against, the, superior, land, forces, led, by, sparta, and, importing, everything, needful, by, maintaining, its, powerful, navy, athens, would, simply, outlast, sparta, whose, citizens, feared, leave, their, city, for, long, lest, the, helots, a, subjugated, population, of, sparta, revolt, this, strategy, required, that, athens, endure, regular, sieges, and, in, 430, bc, it, was, visited, with, an, awful, plague, that, killed, about, a, quarter, of, its, people, including, pericles, with, pericles, gone, less, conservative, elements, gained, power, in, the, city, and, athens, went, on, the, offensive, in, 425, bc, it, captured, 300, 400, spartan, hoplites, soldiers, at, the, battle, of, pylos, a, significant, fraction, of, the, spartan, fighting, force, which, it, could, not, afford, to, lose, meanwhile, athens, suffered, humiliating, defeats, at, delium, in, 424, bc, and, amphipolis, in, 422, the, peace, of, nicias, in, 421, concluded, the, first, stage, of, the, war, with, sparta, recovering, its, hoplites, and, athens, recovering, the, city, of, amphipolis, those, who, signed, the, peace, of, nicias, in, 421, bc, swore, to, uphold, it, for, fifty, years, but, peace, lasted, only, seven, years, the, second, stage, of, the, peloponnesian, war, began, in, 415, bc, when, athens, embarked, on, the, sicilian, expedition, in, magna, graecia, to, support, its, ally, segesta, in, sicily, against, an, attack, by, syracuse, a, spartan, ally, also, in, sicily, and, conquer, the, island, initially, sparta, was, reluctant, to, help, syracuse, but, alcibiades, the, athenian, general, who, had, argued, for, the, sicilian, expedition, defected, to, the, spartan, cause, after, being, accused, of, grossly, impious, acts, alcibiades, convinced, the, spartans, that, they, could, not, allow, athens, to, subjugate, syracuse, the, campaign, ended, in, disaster, for, the, athenians, after, the, athenian, defeat, in, sicily, athens, ionian, possessions, rebelled, with, the, support, of, sparta, as, advised, by, alcibiades, in, 411, bc, an, oligarchical, revolt, in, athens, held, out, the, chance, for, peace, but, the, athenian, navy, which, remained, committed, to, the, democracy, refused, to, accept, the, change, and, continued, fighting, in, athens, name, the, navy, recalled, alcibiades, who, had, been, forced, to, abandon, the, spartan, cause, after, reputedly, seducing, the, wife, of, agis, ii, a, spartan, king, and, made, him, its, head, the, oligarchy, in, athens, collapsed, and, alcibiades, reconquered, what, had, been, lost, for, athens, in, 407, bc, alcibiades, was, replaced, following, a, minor, naval, defeat, at, the, battle, of, notium, the, spartan, general, lysander, having, fortified, his, city, s, naval, power, began, winning, victory, after, victory, athens, won, the, battle, of, arginusae, in, 406, bc, but, was, prevented, by, bad, weather, from, rescuing, many, of, its, sailors, leading, the, city, to, execute, or, exile, eight, of, its, top, naval, commanders, lysander, followed, with, a, crushing, blow, at, the, battle, of, aegospotami, in, 405, bc, which, almost, destroyed, the, athenian, fleet, athens, surrendered, one, year, later, ending, the, peloponnesian, war, and, beginning, a, brief, of, period, of, spartan, hegemony, in, greece, the, war, left, devastation, in, its, wake, discontent, with, spartan, hegemony, from, both, athenian, and, former, spartan, allies, led, to, the, corinthian, war, of, 395, 387, bc, backed, by, the, achaemenid, persian, empire, athens, thebes, corinth, and, argos, significantly, weakened, spartan, military, power, though, unsuccessful, in, ending, spartan, dominance, the, war, concluded, with, the, treaty, of, antalcidas, in, 387, bc, in, which, sparta, was, forced, to, cede, ionia, and, cyprus, to, the, persian, empire, the, corinthian, war, and, its, aftermath, further, sowed, the, seeds, of, discontent, in, spartan, greece, inducing, the, thebans, to, attack, once, more, their, general, epaminondas, crushed, sparta, at, the, battle, of, leuctra, in, 371, bc, inaugurating, a, period, of, theban, dominance, in, greece, in, 346, bc, unable, to, prevail, in, its, ten, year, war, with, phocis, thebes, called, upon, philip, ii, of, macedon, for, aid, macedon, quickly, unified, the, greek, city, states, under, macedonian, hegemony, into, the, league, of, corinth, in, 338, 337, bc, in, 336, bc, power, was, transferred, to, philip, s, son, alexander, the, great, who, spent, the, next, ten, years, conquering, the, persian, empire, and, much, of, western, asia, and, egypt, by, the, age, of, 30, alexander, had, created, one, of, the, largest, empires, in, history, stretching, from, greece, to, northwestern, india, he, was, undefeated, in, battle, and, is, widely, considered, to, be, one, of, history, s, greatest, and, most, successful, military, commanders, after, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, the, macedonian, empire, disintegrated, under, widespread, civil, wars, beginning, the, hellenistic, age, of, greek, history, the, hellenistic, period, of, greek, history, begins, with, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bc, and, ends, with, the, conquest, of, the, greek, peninsula, and, islands, by, rome, in, 146, bc, although, the, establishment, of, roman, rule, did, not, break, the, continuity, of, hellenistic, society, and, culture, which, remained, essentially, unchanged, until, the, advent, of, christianity, it, did, mark, the, end, of, greek, political, independence, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, importance, of, greece, proper, that, is, the, territory, of, modern, greece, within, the, greek, speaking, world, declined, sharply, the, great, centres, of, hellenistic, culture, were, alexandria, and, antioch, capitals, of, ptolemaic, egypt, and, seleucid, syria, respectively, see, hellenistic, civilization, for, the, history, of, greek, culture, outside, greece, in, this, period, athens, and, her, allies, revolted, against, macedon, upon, hearing, that, alexander, the, great, had, died, in, 323, bc, but, were, defeated, within, a, year, in, the, lamian, war, meanwhile, a, struggle, for, power, broke, out, among, alexander, s, generals, which, resulted, in, the, break, up, of, his, empire, and, the, establishment, of, a, number, of, new, kingdoms, in, the, wars, of, the, diadochi, ptolemy, was, left, with, egypt, and, seleucus, with, the, levant, mesopotamia, and, points, east, control, of, greece, thrace, and, anatolia, was, contested, but, by, 298, bc, the, antigonid, dynasty, had, supplanted, the, antipatrid, macedonian, control, of, the, city, states, was, intermittent, with, a, number, of, revolts, athens, rhodes, pergamum, and, other, greek, states, retained, substantial, independence, and, joined, the, aetolian, league, as, a, means, of, defending, it, and, restoring, democracy, in, their, states, as, they, saw, macedon, as, a, tyrannical, kingdom, the, achaean, league, while, nominally, subject, to, the, ptolemies, was, in, effect, independent, and, controlled, most, of, southern, greece, sparta, also, remained, independent, but, generally, refused, to, join, any, league, in, 267, bc, ptolemy, ii, persuaded, the, greek, cities, to, revolt, against, macedon, in, what, became, the, chremonidean, war, named, after, the, athenian, leader, chremonides, the, cities, were, defeated, and, athens, lost, her, independence, and, democratic, institutions, this, marked, the, end, of, athens, as, a, political, actor, although, it, remained, the, largest, wealthiest, and, most, cultivated, city, in, greece, in, 225, bc, macedon, defeated, the, egyptian, fleet, at, cos, and, brought, the, aegean, islands, except, rhodes, under, its, rule, as, well, sparta, remained, hostile, to, the, achaeans, and, in, 227, bc, it, invaded, achaea, and, seized, control, of, the, league, the, remaining, achaeans, preferred, distant, macedon, to, nearby, sparta, and, allied, with, the, former, in, 222, bc, the, macedonian, army, defeated, the, spartans, and, annexed, their, city, the, first, time, sparta, had, ever, been, occupied, by, a, different, state, philip, v, of, macedon, was, the, last, greek, ruler, with, both, the, talent, and, the, opportunity, to, unite, greece, and, preserve, its, independence, against, the, ever, increasing, power, of, rome, under, his, auspices, the, peace, of, naupactus, 217, bc, brought, conflict, between, macedon, and, the, greek, leagues, to, an, end, and, at, this, time, he, controlled, all, of, greece, except, athens, rhodes, and, pergamum, in, 215, bc, however, philip, formed, an, alliance, with, rome, s, enemy, carthage, rome, promptly, lured, the, achaean, cities, away, from, their, nominal, loyalty, to, philip, and, formed, alliances, with, rhodes, and, pergamum, now, the, strongest, power, in, asia, minor, the, first, macedonian, war, broke, out, in, 212, bc, and, ended, inconclusively, in, 205, bc, but, macedon, was, now, marked, as, an, enemy, of, rome, in, 202, bc, rome, defeated, carthage, and, was, free, to, turn, her, attention, eastwards, in, 198, bc, the, second, macedonian, war, broke, out, because, rome, saw, macedon, as, a, potential, ally, of, the, seleucid, empire, the, greatest, power, in, the, east, philip, s, allies, in, greece, deserted, him, and, in, 197, bc, he, was, decisively, defeated, at, the, battle, of, cynoscephalae, by, the, roman, proconsul, titus, quinctius, flaminius, luckily, for, the, greeks, flaminius, was, a, moderate, man, and, an, admirer, of, greek, culture, philip, had, to, surrender, his, fleet, and, become, a, roman, ally, but, he, was, otherwise, spared, at, the, isthmian, games, in, 196, bc, flaminius, declared, all, the, greek, cities, free, although, roman, garrisons, were, placed, at, corinth, and, chalcis, but, the, freedom, promised, by, rome, was, an, illusion, all, the, cities, except, rhodes, were, enrolled, in, a, new, league, which, rome, ultimately, controlled, and, aristocratic, constitutions, were, favored, and, actively, promoted, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, greece, was, conquered, by, the, roman, republic, and, came, under, its, control, still, greek, culture, flourished, during, this, period, city, states, maintained, a, level, of, political, autonomy, and, roman, society, adopted, many, aspects, of, greek, culture, for, example, roman, poets, like, ovid, virgil, and, horace, retold, and, adopted, many, greek, myths, of, old, folding, them, into, roman, culture, roman, society, even, claimed, to, share, a, cultural, lineage, with, greece, as, exemplified, by, virgil, s, epic, the, aeneid, which, details, their, founding, myth, of, how, the, roman, people, descended, from, the, trojan, aeneas, of, homeric, lore, although, the, period, of, roman, rule, in, greece, is, conventionally, dated, as, starting, from, the, sacking, of, corinth, by, the, roman, lucius, mummius, in, 146, bc, macedonia, had, already, come, under, roman, control, with, the, defeat, of, its, king, perseus, by, the, roman, aemilius, paullus, at, pydna, in, 168, bc, the, romans, divided, the, region, into, four, smaller, republics, and, in, 146, bc, macedonia, officially, became, a, province, with, its, capital, at, thessalonica, the, rest, of, the, greek, city, states, eventually, paid, homage, to, rome, ending, their, de, jure, autonomy, as, well, the, romans, left, local, administration, to, the, greeks, without, making, any, attempt, to, abolish, traditional, political, patterns, the, agora, in, athens, continued, to, be, the, center, of, civic, and, political, life, emperor, caracalla, s, decree, in, 212, ad, the, constitutio, antoniniana, extended, citizenship, outside, italy, to, all, free, adult, men, in, the, entire, roman, empire, effectively, raising, provincial, populations, to, equal, status, with, the, city, of, rome, itself, the, importance, of, this, decree, is, historical, not, political, it, set, the, basis, for, integration, where, the, economic, and, judicial, mechanisms, of, the, state, could, be, applied, throughout, the, mediterranean, as, was, once, done, from, latium, into, all, italy, in, practice, integration, did, not, take, place, uniformly, societies, already, integrated, with, rome, such, as, greece, were, favored, by, the, decree, as, opposed, to, the, further, away, poorer, or, more, culturally, different, provinces, like, britain, palestine, or, egypt, caracalla, s, decree, did, not, set, in, motion, the, processes, that, led, to, the, transfer, of, power, from, italy, and, the, west, to, greece, and, the, east, but, rather, accelerated, them, setting, the, foundations, for, the, millennium, long, rise, of, greece, in, the, form, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, as, a, major, power, in, europe, and, the, mediterranean, in, the, middle, ages, the, division, of, the, roman, empire, into, east, and, west, and, the, subsequent, collapse, of, the, western, one, accentuated, the, position, of, greece, in, the, empire, and, eventually, brought, it, into, the, imperial, center, of, power, constantinople, now, modern, day, istanbul, became, the, central, city, of, the, empire, when, constantine, the, great, declared, byzantium, the, new, capital, of, the, roman, empire, renaming, the, city, in, his, honor, this, political, change, signified, the, broader, eastward, migration, of, hellenism, toward, anatolia, and, it, nominally, placed, the, city, as, the, center, of, hellenic, culture, a, beacon, for, greeks, that, lasted, into, the, modern, era, the, east, roman, empire, now, also, known, as, the, byzantine, empire, was, dominated, politically, by, emperors, constantine, the, great, and, justinian, from, 324, to, 610, assimilating, the, roman, tradition, the, emperors, sought, to, build, the, foundation, for, later, developments, and, formation, of, the, empire, the, early, centuries, of, the, empire, were, marked, by, efforts, to, secure, its, borders, and, restore, the, roman, territories, as, well, as, the, formation, and, establishment, of, the, orthodox, church, and, several, of, religious, schisms, following, it, in, the, first, period, of, the, middle, byzantine, era, 610, 867, the, empire, was, attacked, both, by, old, enemies, persians, lombards, avars, and, slavs, as, well, as, by, new, ones, arabs, bulgars, the, main, characteristic, of, this, period, was, instability, as, enemy, attacks, tended, to, extend, deep, into, the, empire, s, interior, even, threatening, the, capital, itself, the, attacks, of, the, slavs, became, less, frequent, as, the, slavic, migrations, to, southeastern, europe, ended, and, permanent, slavic, settlements, and, states, began, to, form, initially, hostile, to, constantinople, until, their, christianization, the, byzantines, referred, to, these, tribes, and, states, as, sclavinias, changes, also, occurred, in, the, internal, structure, of, the, empire, due, to, both, external, and, internal, conditions, the, predominance, of, small, free, farmers, the, expansion, of, military, estates, and, the, development, of, the, system, of, themes, brought, to, completion, the, developments, started, by, early, byzantine, emperors, cultural, and, religious, changes, occurred, as, well, byzantine, administration, and, society, became, inseparably, greek, additionally, the, restoration, of, orthodoxy, after, the, iconoclast, movements, 726, 787, and, 814, 842, allowed, the, successful, resumption, of, missionary, action, among, neighboring, peoples, and, their, placement, within, the, sphere, of, byzantine, cultural, influence, during, this, period, the, empire, was, geographically, reduced, and, economically, damaged, since, it, lost, wealth, producing, regions, however, it, obtained, greater, lingual, dogmatic, and, cultural, homogeneity, from, the, late, 8th, century, the, empire, began, to, recover, from, the, devastating, impact, of, successive, invasions, and, the, reconquest, of, the, greek, peninsula, began, greeks, from, sicily, and, asia, minor, were, brought, in, as, settlers, slavs, were, either, driven, out, to, asia, minor, or, assimilated, and, the, sclavinias, were, forcibly, eradicated, by, the, middle, of, the, 9th, century, the, greek, peninsula, was, under, byzantine, control, again, and, its, cities, began, to, recover, due, to, improved, security, and, the, restoration, of, effective, central, control, after, the, byzantine, empire, was, rescued, from, a, period, of, crisis, through, the, resolute, leadership, of, the, three, komnenoi, emperors, alexios, john, and, manuel, in, the, 12th, century, greece, prospered, recent, research, has, revealed, that, this, period, was, a, time, of, significant, growth, in, the, rural, economy, with, rising, population, levels, and, extensive, tracts, of, new, agricultural, land, being, brought, into, production, the, widespread, construction, of, new, rural, churches, around, this, time, is, a, strong, indication, that, prosperity, was, being, generated, even, in, remote, areas, a, steady, increase, in, population, led, to, a, higher, population, density, and, there, is, good, evidence, that, the, demographic, increase, was, accompanied, by, the, revival, of, towns, according, to, alan, harvey, s, economic, expansion, in, the, byzantine, empire, 900, 1200, towns, expanded, significantly, in, the, twelfth, century, archaeological, evidence, shows, an, increase, in, the, size, of, urban, settlements, together, with, a, notable, upsurge, in, new, towns, it, also, indicates, that, many, medieval, towns, including, athens, thessaloniki, thebes, and, corinth, experienced, a, period, of, rapid, and, sustained, growth, starting, in, the, 11th, century, and, continuing, until, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, the, growth, of, the, towns, attracted, trade, with, the, venetian, republic, in, nearby, italy, and, this, interest, in, trade, appears, to, have, further, increased, economic, prosperity, in, greece, the, venetians, and, others, were, active, traders, in, the, ports, of, the, holy, land, and, they, made, a, living, out, of, shipping, goods, between, the, crusader, kingdoms, of, outremer, and, the, west, while, also, trading, extensively, with, byzantium, and, egypt, a, renaissance, of, byzantine, art, began, in, the, 10th, century, many, of, the, most, important, byzantine, churches, in, and, around, athens, for, example, were, built, around, this, time, this, artistic, revival, reflects, the, urbanization, of, greece, during, this, period, there, was, also, a, revival, in, mosaic, art, with, artists, showing, great, interest, in, depicting, natural, landscapes, with, wild, animals, and, scenes, from, the, hunt, mosaics, became, more, realistic, and, vivid, with, an, increased, emphasis, on, depicting, three, dimensional, forms, with, its, love, of, luxury, and, passion, for, color, the, art, of, this, age, delighted, in, the, production, of, masterpieces, that, spread, the, fame, of, byzantium, throughout, the, christian, world, beautiful, silks, from, the, workshops, of, constantinople, portrayed, animals, in, dazzling, color, such, as, lions, elephants, eagles, and, griffins, confronting, each, other, or, emperors, gorgeously, arrayed, on, horseback, or, engaged, in, the, chase, the, eyes, of, many, patrons, were, attracted, and, the, economy, of, greece, grew, in, the, provinces, regional, schools, of, architecture, began, producing, many, distinctive, styles, that, drew, on, a, range, of, cultural, influences, all, this, suggests, that, there, was, an, increased, demand, for, art, with, more, people, having, access, to, the, necessary, wealth, to, commission, and, pay, for, such, work, yet, the, marvelous, expansion, of, byzantine, art, during, this, period, one, of, the, most, remarkable, facts, in, the, history, of, the, empire, did, not, stop, there, from, the, 10th, to, the, 12th, century, byzantium, was, the, main, source, of, artistic, inspiration, for, the, west, for, example, the, mosaics, of, st, mark, s, basilica, the, torcello, cathedral, in, venice, clearly, show, byzantine, influence, in, their, style, arrangement, and, iconography, similarly, in, sicily, the, mosaics, of, the, palatine, chapel, martorana, and, monreale, cathedral, in, palermo, as, well, as, the, cefal, cathedral, show, the, influence, of, byzantine, art, on, norman, sicily, in, the, 12th, century, andalusian, art, in, western, europe, was, also, influenced, by, byzantium, romanesque, art, too, contains, many, byzantine, elements, including, its, decorative, forms, and, the, plans, of, some, of, its, buildings, e, g, the, domed, churches, of, south, western, france, princes, of, kiev, venetian, doges, abbots, of, monte, cassino, merchants, of, amalfi, and, the, norman, kings, of, sicily, all, drew, from, byzantine, culture, in, their, art, the, year, 1204, marks, the, beginning, of, the, late, byzantine, period, when, constantinople, and, a, number, of, byzantine, territories, were, conquered, by, the, latins, during, the, fourth, crusade, during, this, period, a, number, of, byzantine, greek, successor, states, emerged, the, empire, of, nicaea, the, despotate, of, epirus, and, the, empire, of, trebizond, each, claimed, to, be, the, legitimate, successor, of, the, byzantine, empire, meanwhile, the, latin, and, frank, crusaders, founded, the, catholic, latin, empire, known, to, the, byzantines, as, frankokratia, or, latinokratia, with, constantinople, as, its, capital, among, its, vassal, states, were, the, principality, of, achaea, the, duchy, of, athens, the, duchy, of, the, archipelago, and, the, kingdom, of, thessalonica, under, the, latin, empire, elements, of, feudalism, entered, medieval, greek, life, the, latin, empire, lasted, only, 57, years, and, in, 1261, constantinople, was, reclaimed, by, the, nicaean, empire, and, the, byzantine, empire, was, restored, however, in, mainland, greece, and, the, greek, islands, various, latin, and, venetian, possessions, continued, to, exist, from, 1261, onwards, byzantium, underwent, a, gradual, weakening, of, its, internal, structures, and, the, reduction, of, its, territories, from, ottoman, invasions, culminating, in, the, fall, of, constantinople, on, may, 29, 1453, the, ottoman, conquest, of, constantinople, resulted, in, the, official, end, of, both, the, eastern, roman, empire, and, the, byzantine, period, of, greek, history, the, greeks, held, out, in, the, peloponnese, until, 1460, and, the, venetians, and, genoese, clung, to, some, of, the, islands, but, by, the, early, 16th, century, all, of, mainland, greece, and, most, of, the, aegean, islands, were, conquered, by, the, ottoman, empire, excluding, several, port, cities, still, held, by, the, venetians, nafplio, monemvasia, parga, and, methone, the, most, important, of, them, the, cyclades, in, the, middle, of, the, aegean, sea, were, officially, annexed, by, the, ottomans, in, 1579, although, they, were, under, vassal, status, since, the, 1530s, cyprus, fell, in, 1571, and, the, venetians, retained, crete, until, 1669, the, ionian, islands, were, never, ruled, by, the, ottomans, with, the, exception, of, kefalonia, from, 1479, to, 1481, and, from, 1485, to, 1500, and, they, remained, under, the, rule, of, the, republic, of, venice, it, was, in, the, ionian, islands, where, modern, greek, statehood, was, born, with, the, creation, of, the, republic, of, the, seven, islands, in, 1800, when, the, ottomans, arrived, two, greek, migrations, occurred, in, the, first, the, greek, intelligentsia, migrated, to, western, europe, influencing, the, advent, of, the, european, renaissance, in, the, second, greeks, left, the, plains, of, the, greek, peninsula, and, resettled, in, the, mountains, ottoman, greece, was, a, multiethnic, society, but, in, a, way, very, different, from, the, modern, western, notion, of, multiculturalism, the, greeks, were, given, some, privileges, and, freedom, by, the, empire, but, they, were, exposed, to, tyranny, deriving, from, malpractices, of, regional, administrative, personnel, over, which, the, central, government, had, only, remote, and, incomplete, control, the, ottoman, millet, system, contributed, to, the, ethnic, cohesion, of, orthodox, greeks, by, segregating, the, various, peoples, within, the, ottoman, empire, based, on, religion, greeks, living, in, the, plains, during, ottoman, rule, were, either, christians, or, crypto, christians, greek, muslims, who, were, secret, practitioners, of, the, greek, orthodox, faith, some, greeks, became, crypto, christians, to, avoid, heavy, taxes, while, retaining, their, religious, identity, and, ties, to, the, greek, orthodox, church, greeks, who, converted, to, islam, and, were, not, crypto, christians, were, deemed, turks, in, the, eyes, of, orthodox, greeks, even, if, they, did, not, adopt, the, turkish, language, evidence, of, the, ethnic, and, religious, tensions, in, greece, under, ottoman, rule, the, ottomans, ruled, most, of, greece, until, the, early, 19th, century, the, first, self, governed, hellenic, state, since, the, middle, ages, was, established, on, the, ionian, islands, during, the, french, revolutionary, wars, in, 1800, 21, years, before, the,

in, the, early, months, of, 1821, the, greeks, declared, their, independence, but, did, not, achieve, it, until, 1829, the, great, powers, first, shared, the, same, view, concerning, the, necessity, of, preserving, the, status, quo, of, the, ottoman, empire, but, soon, changed, their, stance, scores, of, non, greeks, philhellenes, volunteered, to, fight, for, the, cause, including, lord, byron,
