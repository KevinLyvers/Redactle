the, history, of, religion, refers, to, the, written, record, of, human, religious, feelings, thoughts, and, ideas, this, period, of, religious, history, begins, with, the, invention, of, writing, about, 5, 200, years, ago, 3200, bce, the, prehistory, of, religion, involves, the, study, of, religious, beliefs, that, existed, prior, to, the, advent, of, written, records, one, can, also, study, comparative, religious, chronology, through, a, timeline, of, religion, or, the, interrelationships, and, historical, diversification, of, religious, ideologies, through, the, use, of, evolutionary, philosophy, and, broad, comparativism, writing, played, a, major, role, in, standardizing, religious, texts, regardless, of, time, or, location, and, making, easier, the, memorization, of, prayers, and, divine, rules, the, concept, of, religion, was, formed, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, sacred, texts, like, the, bible, the, quran, and, others, did, not, have, a, word, or, even, a, concept, of, religion, in, the, original, languages, and, neither, did, the, people, or, the, cultures, in, which, these, sacred, texts, were, written, the, word, religion, as, used, in, the, 21st, century, does, not, have, an, obvious, pre, colonial, translation, into, non, european, languages, the, anthropologist, daniel, dubuisson, writes, that, what, the, west, and, the, history, of, religions, in, its, wake, have, objectified, under, the, name, religion, is, something, quite, unique, which, could, be, appropriate, only, to, itself, and, its, own, history, the, school, of, religious, history, called, the, religionsgeschichtliche, schule, a, late, 19th, century, german, school, of, thought, originated, the, systematic, study, of, religion, as, a, socio, cultural, phenomenon, it, depicted, religion, as, evolving, with, human, culture, from, polytheism, to, monotheism, the, religionsgeschichtliche, schule, emerged, at, a, time, when, scholarly, study, of, the, bible, and, of, church, history, flourished, in, germany, and, elsewhere, see, higher, criticism, also, called, the, historical, critical, method, the, study, of, religion, is, important, religion, and, similar, concepts, have, often, shaped, civilizations, law, and, moral, codes, social, structure, art, and, music, in, order, to, better, understand, the, origin, and, current, diversity, of, religious, belief, systems, throughout, the, world, recent, studies, have, attempted, to, focus, on, historical, interrelationships, and, diversification, of, all, major, organized, religions, applying, modern, evolutionary, philosophy, to, the, comparative, analysis, of, putative, ideological, groups, these, studies, take, an, agnostic, pluralistic, approach, in, the, hope, of, moving, beyond, chauvinistic, cultural, tribalism, which, is, increasingly, interfering, with, our, ability, to, understand, other, cultures, and, address, growing, global, challenges, the, earliest, archeological, evidence, interpreted, by, some, as, suggestive, of, the, emergence, of, religious, ideas, dates, back, several, hundred, thousand, years, to, the, middle, and, lower, paleolithic, periods, some, archaeologists, conclude, that, the, apparently, intentional, burial, of, archaic, humans, neanderthals, and, even, homo, naledi, as, early, as, 300, 000, years, ago, is, proof, that, religious, ideas, already, existed, but, such, a, connection, is, entirely, conjectural, other, evidence, that, some, infer, as, indicative, of, religious, ideas, includes, symbolic, artifacts, from, middle, stone, age, sites, in, africa, however, the, interpretation, of, early, paleolithic, artifacts, with, regard, to, how, they, relate, to, religious, ideas, remains, controversial, archeological, evidence, from, more, recent, periods, is, less, controversial, scientists, generally, interpret, a, number, of, artifacts, from, the, upper, paleolithic, 50, 000, 13, 000, bce, as, representing, religious, ideas, examples, of, upper, paleolithic, remains, that, some, associate, with, religious, beliefs, include, the, lion, man, the, venus, figurines, and, the, elaborate, ritual, burial, from, sungir, in, the, 19th, century, researchers, proposed, various, theories, regarding, the, origin, of, religion, challenging, earlier, claims, of, a, christianity, like, urreligion, early, theorists, such, as, edward, burnett, tylor, 1832, 1917, and, herbert, spencer, 1820, 1903, emphasized, the, concept, of, animism, while, archaeologist, john, lubbock, 1834, 1913, used, the, term, fetishism, meanwhile, the, religious, scholar, max, m, ller, 1823, 1900, theorized, that, religion, began, in, hedonism, and, the, folklorist, wilhelm, mannhardt, 1831, 1880, suggested, that, religion, began, in, naturalism, by, which, he, meant, mythological, explanations, for, natural, events, all, of, these, theories, have, been, widely, criticized, since, then, there, is, no, broad, consensus, regarding, the, origin, of, religion, pre, pottery, neolithic, a, ppna, g, bekli, tepe, the, oldest, potentially, religious, site, yet, discovered, anywhere, includes, circles, of, erected,
