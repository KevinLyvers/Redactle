changes, began, to, occur, between, 2600, and, 2000, bce, region, became, more, arid, and, mehrgarh, was, abandoned, in, favor, of, the, indus, valley, where, a, new, civilization, was, in, the, early, stages, of, development, the, bronze, age, in, the, indus, valley, began, around, 3300, bce, with, the, indus, valley, civilization, along, with, ancient, egypt, and, mesopotamia, it, was, one, of, three, early, civilizations, of, the, old, world, and, of, the, three, the, most, widespread, covering, an, area, of, 1, 25, million, km, 2, it, flourished, in, the, basins, of, the, indus, river, in, what, is, today, the, pakistani, provinces, of, sindh, punjab, and, balochistan, and, along, a, system, of, perennial, mostly, monsoon, fed, rivers, that, once, coursed, in, the, vicinity, of, the, seasonal, ghaggar, hakra, river, in, parts, of, north, west, india, at, its, peak, the, civilization, hosted, a, population, of, approximately, 5, million, spread, across, hundreds, of, settlements, extending, as, far, as, the, arabian, sea, to, present, day, southern, and, eastern, afghanistan, and, the, himalayas, inhabitants, of, the, ancient, indus, river, valley, the, harappans,

as, an, offshoot, called, the, kulli, culture, 2500, 2000, bce, in, southern, balochistan, and, was, noted, for, its, cities, built, of, brick, roadside, drainage, system, and, multi, storeyed, houses, it, is, thought, to, have, had, some, kind, of, municipal, organisation, as, well, during, the, late, period, of, this, civilisation, signs, of, a, gradual, decline, began, to, emerge, and, by, around, 1700, bce, most, of, the, cities, were, abandoned, however, the, indus, valley, civilisation, did, not, disappear, suddenly, and, some, elements, of, the, indus, civilisation, may, have, survived, aridification, of, this, region, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, may, have, been, the, initial, spur, for, the, urbanisation, associated, with, the, civilisation, but, eventually, also, reduced, the, water, supply, enough, to, cause, the, civilisation, s, demise, and, to, scatter, its, population, eastward, the, civilization, collapsed, around, 1700, bce, though, the, reasons, behind, its, fall, are, still, unknown, through, the, excavation, of, the, indus, cities, and, analysis, of, town, planning, and, seals, it, has, been, inferred, that, the, civilization, had, high, level, of, sophistication, in, its, town, planning, arts, crafts, and, trade, the, vedic, period, c, 1500, c, 500, bce, is, postulated, to, have, formed, during, the, 1500, bce, to, 800, bce, as,

aryans, religious, beliefs, and, practices, from, the, bactria, margiana, culture, and, the, native, harappan, indus, beliefs, of, the, former, indus, valley, civilisation, eventually, gave, rise, to, vedic, culture, and, tribes, early, indo, aryans, were, a, late, bronze, age, society, centred, in, the, punjab, organised, into, tribes, rather, than, kingdoms, and, primarily, sustained, by, a, pastoral, way, of, life, during, this, period, the, vedas, the, oldest, scriptures, of, hinduism, were, composed, the, main, vedic, tribes, remaining, in, the, indus, valley, by, 550, bc, were, the, kamboja, sindhu, taksas, of, gandhara, the, madras, and, kathas, of, the, river, chenab, mallas, of, the, river, ravi, and, tugras, of, the, river, sutlej, these, several, tribes, and, principalities, fought, against, one, another, to, such, an, extent, that, the, indus, valley, no, longer, had, one, powerful, vedic, tribal, kingdom, to, defend, against, outsiders, and, to, wield, the, warring, tribes, into, one, organized, kingdom, king, pushkarasarin, of, gandhara, was, engaged, in, power, struggles, against, his, local, rivals, and, as, such, the, khyber, pass, remained, poorly, defended, king, darius, i, of, the, achaemenid, empire, took, advantage, of, the, opportunity, and, planned, for, an, invasion, the, indus, valley, was, fabled, in, persia, for, its, gold, and, fertile, soil, and, conquering, it, had, been, a, major, objective, of, his, predecessor, cyrus, the, great, in, 542, bc, cyrus, had, led, his, army, and, conquered, the, makran, coast, in, southern, balochistan, however, he, is, known, to, have, campaigned, beyond, makran, in, the, regions, of, kalat, khuzdar, and, panjgur, and, lost, most, of, his, army, in, the, gedrosian, desert, speculated, today, as, the, kharan, desert, in, 518, bc, darius, led, his, army, through, the, khyber, pass, and, southwards, in, stages, eventually, reaching, the, arabian, sea, coast, in, sindh, by, 516, bc, under, persian, rule, a, system, of, centralized, administration, with, a, bureaucratic, system, was, introduced, into, the, indus, valley, for, the, first, time, establishing, several, satrapies, gand, ra, around, the, general, region, of, gandhara, hindush, around, punjab, and, sindh, arachosia, encompassing, parts, of, present, day, khyber, pakhtunkhwa, and, balochistan, sattagydia, around, the, bannu, basin, and, gedrosia, covering, much, of, the, makran, region, of, southern, balochistan, what, is, known, about, the, easternmost, satraps, and, borderlands, of, the, achaemenid, empire, is, alluded, to, in, the, darius, inscriptions, and, from, greek, sources, such, as, the, histories, of, herodotus, and, the, later, alexander, chronicles, arrian, strabo, et, al, these, sources, list, three, indus, valley, tributaries, or, conquered, territories, that, were, subordinated, to, the, persian, empire, and, made, to, pay, tributes, to, the, persian, kings, by, spring, of, 326, bc, alexander, began, on, his, indus, expedition, from, bactria, leaving, behind, 3500, horses, and, 10, 000, soldiers, he, divided, his, army, into, two, groups, the, larger, force, would, enter, the, indus, valley, through, the, khyber, pass, just, as, darius, had, done, 200, years, earlier, while, a, smaller, force, under, the, personal, command, of, alexander, entered, through, a, northern, route, possibly, through, broghol, or, dorah, pass, near, chitral, alexander, was, commanding, a, group, of, shield, bearing, guards, foot, companions, archers, agrianians, and, horse, javelin, men, and, led, them, against, the, tribes, of, the, former, gandhara, satrapy, the, first, tribe, they, encountered, were, the, aspasioi, tribe, of, the, kunar, valley, who, initiated, a, fierce, battle, against, alexander, in, which, he, himself, was, wounded, in, the, shoulder, by, a, dart, however, the, aspasioi, eventually, lost, and, 40, 000, people, were, enslaved, alexander, then, continued, in, a, southwestern, direction, where, he, encountered, the, assakenoi, tribe, of, the, swat, buner, valleys, in, april, 326, bc, the, assakenoi, fought, bravely, and, offered, stubborn, resistance, to, alexander, and, his, army, in, the, cities, of, ora, bazira, barikot, and, massaga, so, enraged, was, alexander, about, the, resistance, put, up, by, the, assakenoi, that, he, killed, the, entire, population, of, massaga, and, reduced, its, buildings, to, rubble, similar, slaughters, followed, in, ora, a, similar, slaughter, then, followed, at, ora, another, stronghold, of, the, assakenoi, the, stories, of, these, slaughters, reached, numerous, assakenians, who, began, fleeing, to, aornos, a, hill, fort, located, between, shangla, and, kohistan, alexander, followed, close, behind, their, heels, and, besieged, the, strategic, hill, fort, eventually, capturing, and, destroying, the, fort, and, killing, everyone, inside, the, remaining, smaller, tribes, either, surrendered, or, like, the, astanenoi, tribe, of, pushkalavati, charsadda, were, quickly, neutralized, where, 38, 000, soldiers, and, 230, 000, oxen, were, captured, by, alexander, eventually, alexander, s, smaller, force, would, meet, with, the, larger, force, which, had, come, through, the, khyber, pass, met, at, attock, with, the, conquest, of, gandhara, complete, alexander, switched, to, strengthening, his, military, supply, line, which, by, now, stretched, dangerously, vulnerable, over, the, hindu, kush, back, to, balkh, in, bactria, after, conquering, gandhara, and, solidifying, his, supply, line, back, to, bactria, alexander, combined, his, forces, with, the, king, ambhi, of, taxila, and, crossed, the, river, indus, in, july, 326, bc, to, begin, the, archosia, punjab, campaign, his, first, resistance, would, come, at, the, river, jhelum, near, bhera, against, king, porus, of, the, paurava, tribe, the, famous, battle, of, the, hydaspes, jhelum, between, alexander, with, ambhi, and, porus, would, be, the, last, major, battle, fought, by, him, after, defeating, porus, his, battle, weary, troops, refused, to, advance, into, india, to, engage, the, army, of, nanda, dynasty, and, its, vanguard, of, trampling, elephants, alexander, therefore, proceeded, south, west, along, the, indus, valley, along, the, way, he, engaged, in, several, battles, with, smaller, kingdoms, in, multan, and, sindh, before, marching, his, army, westward, across, the, makran, desert, towards, what, is, now, iran, in, crossing, the, desert, alexander, s, army, took, enormous, casualties, from, hunger, and, thirst, but, fought, no, human, enemy, they, encountered, the, fish, eaters, or, ichthyophagi, primitive, people, who, lived, on, the, makran, coast, who, had, matted, hair, no, fire, no,

ali, had, formed, the, central, national, muhammadan, association, to, work, towards, the, political, advancement, of, the, indian, muslims, who, had, suffered, grievously, in, 1857, in, the, aftermath, of, the, failed, sepoy, mutiny, against, the, east, india, company, the, british, were, seen, as, foreign, invaders, but, the, organization, declined, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, 1885, the, indian, national, congress, was, founded, as, a, forum, which, later, became, a, party, to, promote, a, nationalist, cause, although, the, congress, attempted, to, include, the, muslim, community, in, the, struggle, for, independence, from, the, british, rule, and, some, muslims, were, very, active, in, the, congress, the, majority, of, muslim, leaders, including, the, influential, sir, syed, ahmed, khan, did, not, trust, the, party, a, turning, point, came, in, 1900, when, the, british, administration, in, the, united, provinces, of, agra, and, oudh, acceded, to, hindu, demands, and, made, hindi, the, version, of, the, hindustani, language, written, in, the, devanagari, script, the, official, language, the, proselytisation, conducted, in, the, region, by, the, activists, of, a, new, hindu, reformist, movement, also, stirred, muslim, s, concerns, about, their, faith, eventually, the, muslims, feared, that, the, hindu, majority, would, seek, to, suppress, the, rights, of, muslims, in, the, region, following, the, departure, of, the, british, the, all, india, muslim, league, was, founded, by, shaiiq, e, mustafa, on, 30, december, 1906, in, the, aftermath, of, division, of, bengal, on, the, sidelines, of, the, annual, all, india, muhammadan, educational, conference, in, shahbagh, dhaka, east, bengal, the, meeting, was, attended, by, three, thousand, delegates, and, presided, over, by, nawab, viqar, ul, mulk, it, addressed, the, issue, of, safeguarding, interests, of, muslims, and, finalised, a, programme, a, resolution, moved, by, nawab, salimullah, and, seconded, by, hakim, ajmal, khan, nawab, viqar, ul, mulk, conservative, declared, the, musalmans, are, only, a, fifth, in, number, as, compared, with, the, total, population, of, the, country, and, it, is, manifest, that, if, at, any, remote, period, the, british, government, ceases, to, exist, in, india, then, the, rule, of, india, would, pass, into, the, hands, of, that, community, which, is, nearly, four, times, as, large, as, ourselves, our, life, our, property, our, honour, and, our, faith, will, all, be, in, great, danger, when, even, now, that, a, powerful, british, administration, is, protecting, its, subjects, we, the, musalmans, have, to, face, most, serious, difficulties, in, safe, guarding, our, interests, from, the, grasping, hands, of, our, neighbors, the, constitution, and, principles, of, the, league, were, contained, in, the, green, book, written, by, maulana, mohammad, ali, its, goals, at, this, stage, did, not, include, establishing, an, independent, muslim, state, but, rather, concentrated, on, protecting, muslim, liberties, and, rights, promoting, understanding, between, the, muslim, community, and, other, indians, educating, the, muslim, and, indian, community, at, large, on, the, actions, of, the, government, and, discouraging, violence, however, several, factors, over, the, next, thirty, years, including, sectarian, violence, led, to, a, re, evaluation, of, the, league, s, aims, among, those, muslims, in, the, congress, who, did, not, initially, join, the, league, was, jinnah, a, prominent, statesman, and, barrister, in, bombay, this, was, because, the, first, article, of, the, league, s, platform, was, to, promote, among, the, mussalmans, muslims, of, india, feelings, of, loyalty, to, the, british, government, the, league, remained, loyal, to, the, british, administration, for, five, years, until, the, british, decided, to, reverse, the, partition, of, bengal, the, muslim, league, saw, this, british, decision, as, partial, to, hindus, in, 1907, a, vocal, group, of, hindu, hard, liners, within, the, indian, national, congress, movement, separated, from, it, and, started, to, pursue, a, pro, hindu, movement, openly, this, group, was, spearheaded, by, the, famous, triumvirate, of, lal, bal, pal, lala, lajpat, rai, bal, gangadhar, tilak, and, bipin, chandra, pal, of, punjab, bombay, and, bengal, provinces, respectively, their, influence, spread, rapidly, among, other, like, minded, hindus, they, called, it, hindu, nationalism, and, it, became, a, cause, of, serious, concern, for, muslims, however, jinnah, did, not, join, the, league, until, 1913, when, the, party, changed, its, platform, to, one, of, indian, independence, as, a, reaction, against, the, british, decision, to, reverse, the, 1905, partition, of, bengal, which, the, league, regarded, it, as, a, betrayal, of, the, bengali, muslims, after, vociferous, protests, of, the, hindu, population, and, violence, engineered, by, secret, groups, such, as, anushilan, samiti, and, its, offshoot, jugantar, of, aurobindo, and, his, brother, etc, the, british, had, decided, to, reunite, bengal, again, till, this, stage, jinnah, believed, in, mutual, co, operation, to, achieve, an, independent, united, india, although, he, argued, that, muslims, should, be, guaranteed, one, third, of, the, seats, in, any, indian, parliament, the, league, gradually, became, the, leading, representative, body, of, indian, muslims, jinnah, became, its, president, in, 1916, and, negotiated, the, lucknow, pact, with, the, congress, leader, bal, gangadhar, tilak, by, which, congress, conceded, the, principle, of, separate, electorates, and, weighted, representation, for, the, muslim, community, however, jinnah, broke, with, the, congress, in, 1920, when, the, congress, leader, mohandas, gandhi, launched, a, law, violating, non, cooperation, movement, against, the, british, which, a, temperamentally, law, abiding, barrister, jinnah, disapproved, of, jinnah, also, became, convinced, that, the, congress, would, renounce, its, support, for, separate, electorates, for, muslims, which, indeed, it, did, in, 1928, in, 1927, the, british, proposed, a, constitution, for, india, as, recommended, by, the, simon, commission, but, they, failed, to, reconcile, all, parties, the, british, then, turned, the, matter, over, to, the, league, and, the, congress, and, in, 1928, an, all, parties, congress, was, convened, in, delhi, the, attempt, failed, but, two, more, conferences, were, held, and, at, the, bombay, conference, in, may, it, was, agreed, that, a, small, committee, should, work, on, the, constitution, the, prominent, congress, leader, motilal, nehru, headed, the, committee, which, included, two, muslims, syed, ali, imam, and, shoaib, quereshi, motilal, s, son, pt, jawaharlal, nehru, was, its, secretary, the, league, however, rejected, the, committee, s, report, the, so, called, nehru, report, arguing, that, its, proposals, gave, too, little, representation, one, quarter, to, muslims, the, league, had, demanded, at, least, one, third, representation, in, the, legislature, jinnah, announced, a, parting, of, the, ways, after, reading, the, report, and, relations, between, the, congress, and, the, league, began, to, sour, the, general, elections, held, in, the, united, kingdom, had, already, weakened, the, leftist, labour, party, led, by, prime, minister, ramsay, macdonald, furthermore, the, labour, party, s, government, was, already, weakened, by, the, outcomes, of, world, war, i, which, fueled, new, hopes, for, progress, towards, self, government, in, british, india, in, fact, mohandas, k, gandhi, traveled, to, london, to, press, the, idea, of, self, government, in, british, india, and, claimed, to, represent, all, indians, whilst, duly, criticized, the, muslim, league, as, being, sectarian, and, divisive, after, reviewing, the, report, of, the, simon, commission, the, indian, congress, initiated, a, massive, civil, disobedience, movement, under, gandhi, the, muslim, league, reserved, their, opinion, on, the, simon, report, declaring, that, the, report, was, not, final, and, the, matters, should, be, decided, after, consultations, with, the, leaders, representing, all, communities, in, india, the, round, table, conferences, was, held, but, these, achieved, little, since, gandhi, and, the, league, were, unable, to, reach, a, compromise, witnessing, the, events, of, the, round, table, conferences, jinnah, had, despaired, of, politics, and, particularly, of, getting, mainstream, parties, like, the, congress, to, be, sensitive, to, minority, priorities, during, this, time, in, 1930, notable, writer, and, poet, muhammad, iqbal, called, for, a, separate, and, autonomous, nation, state, who, in, his, presidential, address, to, the, 1930, convention, of, the, muslim, league, said, that, he, felt, that, a, separate, muslim, state, was, essential, in, an, otherwise, hindu, dominated, south, asia, india, is, a, continent, of, human, groups, belonging, to, different, races, speaking, different, languages, and, professing, different, religions, personally, i, would, like, to, see, the, punjab, north, west, frontier, province, sind, and, baluchistan, amalgamated, into, a, single, state, self, government, within, the, british, empire, or, without, the, british, empire, the, formation, of, a, consolidated, north, west, indian, muslim, state, appears, to, me, to, be, the, final, destiny, of, the, muslims, at, least, of, north, west, india, the, name, of, the, nation, state, was, coined, by, the, cambridge, university, s, political, science, student, and, muslim, nationalist, rahmat, ali, and, was, published, on, 28, january, 1933, in, the, pamphlet, now, or, never, after, coining, the, name, of, the, nation, state, ali, noticed, that, there, is, an, acronym, formed, from, the, names, of, the, homelands, of, muslims, in, northwest, india, after, the, publication, of, the, pamphlet, the, hindu, press, vehemently, criticized, it, and, the, word, pakstan, used, in, it, thus, this, word, became, a, heated, topic, of, debate, with, the, addition, of, an, i, to, improve, the, pronunciation, the, name, of, pakistan, grew, in, popularity, and, led, to, the, commencement, of, the, pakistan, movement, and, consequently, the, creation, of, pakistan, in, urdu, and, persian, languages, the, name, encapsulates, the, concept, of, pak, pure, and, stan, land, and, hence, a, pure, land, in, 1935, the, british, government, proposed, to, hand, over, substantial, power, to, elected, indian, provincial, legislatures, with, elections, to, be, held, in, 1937, after, the, elections, the, league, took, office, in, bengal, and, punjab, but, the, congress, won, office, in, most, of, the, other, provinces, and, refused, to, devolve, power, with, the, league, in, provinces, with, large, muslim, minorities, citing, technical, difficulties, the, subsequent, congress, rule, was, unpopular, among, muslims, and, seen, as, a, reign, of, hindu, tyranny, by, muslim, leaders, mohammad, ali, jinnah, declared, 22, december, 1939, a, day, of, deliverance, for, indian, muslims, it, was, meant, to, celebrate, the, resignation, of, all, members, of, the, congress, party, from, provincial, and, central, offices, meanwhile, muslim, ideologues, for, independence, also, felt, vindicated, by, the, presidential, address, of, v, d, savarkar, at, the, 19th, session, of, the, famous, hindu, nationalist, party, hindu, mahasabha, in, 1937, in, it, this, legendary, revolutionary, popularly, called, veer, savarkar, and, known, as, the, iconic, father, of, the, hindu, fundamentalist, ideology, propounded, the, seminal, ideas, of, his, two, nation, theory, or, ethnic, exclusivism, which, influenced, jinnah, profoundly, in, 1940, jinnah, called, a, general, session, of, the, muslim, league, in, lahore, to, discuss, the, situation, that, had, arisen, due, to, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, and, the, government, of, india, joining, the, war, without, consulting, indian, leaders, the, meeting, was, also, aimed, at, analyzing, the, reasons, that, led, to, the, defeat, of, the, muslim, league, in, the, general, election, of, 1937, in, the, muslim, majority, provinces, in, his, speech, jinnah, criticized, the, indian, congress, and, the, nationalists, and, espoused, the, two, nation, theory, and, the, reasons, for, the, demand, for, separate, homelands, sikandar, hayat, khan, the, chief, minister, of, punjab, drafted, the, original, resolution, but, disavowed, the, final, version, that, had, emerged, after, protracted, redrafting, by, the, subject, committee, of, the, muslim, league, the, final, text, unambiguously, rejected, the, concept, of, a, united, india, because, of, increasing, inter, religious, violence, and, recommended, the, creation, of, independent, states, the, resolution, was, moved, in, the, general, session, by, shere, bangla, bengali, nationalist, akf, haq, the, chief, minister, of, bengal, supported, by, chaudhry, khaliquzzaman, and, other, leaders, and, was, adopted, on, 23, march, 1940, the, resolution, read, as, follows, no, constitutional, plan, would, be, workable, or, acceptable, to, the, muslims, unless, geographical, contiguous, units, are, demarcated, into, regions, which, should, be, so, constituted, with, such, territorial, readjustments, as, may, be, necessary, that, the, areas, in, which, the, muslims, are, numerically, in, majority, as, in, the, north, western, and, eastern, zones, of, india, should, be, grouped, to, constitute, independent, states, in, which, the, constituent, units, shall, be, autonomous, and, sovereign, that, adequate, effective, and, mandatory, safeguards, shall, be, specifically, provided, in, the, constitution, for, minorities, in, the, units, and, in, the, regions, for, the, protection, of, their, religious, cultural, economic, political, administrative, and, other, rights, of, the, minorities, with, their, consultation, arrangements, thus, should, be, made, for, the, security, of, muslims, where, they, were, in, a, minority, important, leaders, in, the, muslim, league, highlighted, that, pakistan, would, be, a, new, medina, in, other, words, the, second, islamic, state, established, after, muhammad, s, creation, of, an, islamic, state, in, medina, pakistan, was, popularly, envisaged, as, an, islamic, utopia, a, successor, to, the, defunct, turkish, caliphate, and, a, leader, and, protector, of, the, entire, islamic, world, islamic, scholars, debated, over, whether, it, was, possible, for, the, proposed, pakistan, to, truly, become, an, islamic, state, while, the, congress, top, leadership, had, been, in, prison, following, the, 1942, quit, india, movement, there, was, intense, debate, among, indian, muslims, over, the, creation, of, a, separate, homeland, the, majority, of, barelvis, and, barelvi, ulema, supported, the, creation, of, pakistan, and, pirs, and, sunni, ulema, were, mobilized, by, the, muslim, league, to, demonstrate, that, india, s, muslim, masses, wanted, a, separate, country, the, barelvis, believed, that, any, co, operation, with, hindus, would, be, counter, productive, on, the, other, hand, most, deobandis, who, were, led, by, maulana, husain, ahmad, madani, were, opposed, to, the, creation, of, pakistan, and, the, two, nation, theory, according, to, them, muslims, and, hindus, could, be, one, nation, and, muslims, were, only, a, nation, of, themselves, in, the, religious, sense, and, not, in, the, territorial, sense, at, the, same, time, some, deobandi, ulema, such, as, maulana, ashraf, ali, thanvi, mufti, muhammad, shafi, and, maulana, shabbir, ahmad, usmani, were, supportive, of, the, muslim, league, s, demand, to, create, a, separate, pakistan, muslims, who, were, living, in, provinces, where, they, were, demographically, a, minority, such, as, the, united, provinces, where, the, muslim, league, enjoyed, popular, support, were, assured, by, jinnah, that, they, could, remain, in, india, migrate, to, pakistan, or, continue, living, in, india, but, as, pakistani, citizens, in, the, constituent, assembly, elections, of, 1946, the, muslim, league, won, 425, out, of, 496, seats, reserved, for, muslims, polling, 89, 2, of, total, votes, the, congress, had, hitherto, refused, to, acknowledge, the, muslim, league, s, claim, of, being, the, representative, of, indian, muslims, but, finally, acquiesced, to, the, league, s, claim, after, the, results, of, this, election, the, muslim, league, s, demand, for, pakistan, had, received, overwhelming, popular, support, from, india, s, muslims, especially, those, muslims, who, were, living, in, provinces, such, as, up, where, they, were, a, minority, the, british, had, neither, the, will, nor, the, financial, resources, or, military, power, to, hold, india, any, longer, but, they, were, also, determined, to, avoid, partition, and, for, this, purpose, they, arranged, the, cabinet, mission, plan, according, to, this, plan, india, would, be, kept, united, but, would, be, heavily, decentralized, with, separate, groupings, of, hindu, and, muslim, majority, provinces, the, muslim, league, accepted, this, plan, as, it, contained, the, essence, of, pakistan, but, the, congress, rejected, it, after, the, failure, of, the, cabinet, mission, plan, jinnah, called, for, muslims, to, observe, direct, action, day, to, demand, the, creation, of, a, separate, pakistan, the, direct, action, day, morphed, into, violent, riots, between, hindus, and, muslims, in, calcutta, with, the, violence, displaying, elements, of, ethnic, cleansing, the, riots, in, calcutta, were, followed, by, intense, communal, rioting, elsewhere, including, in, noakhali, where, hindus, were, attacked, by, muslims, and, bihar, where, hindus, attacked, muslims, in, october, resulting, in, large, scale, displacement, in, march, 1947, such, violence, reached, punjab, where, sikhs, and, hindus, were, massacred, and, driven, out, by, muslims, in, the, rawalpindi, division, the, british, prime, minister, attlee, appointed, lord, louis, mountbatten, as, india, s, last, viceroy, to, negotiate, the, independence, of, pakistan, and, india, and, immediate, british, withdrawal, british, leaders, including, mountbatten, did, not, support, the, creation, of, pakistan, but, failed, to, convince, jinnah, otherwise, mountbatten, later, confessed, that, he, would, most, probably, have, sabotaged, the, creation, of, pakistan, had, he, known, that, jinnah, was, dying, of, tuberculosis, in, early, 1947, the, british, had, announced, their, desire, to, grant, india, its, independence, by, june, 1948, however, lord, mountbatten, decided, to, advance, the, date, in, a, meeting, in, june, nehru, and, abul, kalam, azad, representing, the, congress, jinnah, representing, the, muslim, league, b, r, ambedkar, representing, the, untouchable, community, and, master, tara, singh, representing, the, sikhs, agreed, to, partition, india, along, religious, lines, on, 14, august, 1947, pakistan, gained, independence, india, gained, independence, the, following, day, the, two, provinces, of, british, india, punjab, and, bengal, were, divided, along, religious, lines, by, the, radcliffe, commission, mountbatten, is, alleged, to, have, influenced, the, radcliffe, commission, to, draw, the, line, in, india, s, favour, punjab, s, mostly, muslim, western, part, went, to, pakistan, and, its, mostly, hindu, sikh, eastern, part, went, to, india, but, there, were, significant, muslim, minorities, in, punjab, s, eastern, section, and, likewise, there, were, many, hindus, and, sikhs, living, in, punjab, s, western, areas, intense, communal, rioting, in, the, punjab, forced, the, governments, of, india, and, pakistan, to, agree, to, a, forced, population, exchange, of, muslim, and, hindu, sikh, minorities, living, in, punjab, after, this, population, exchange, only, a, few, thousand, low, caste, hindus, remained, in, pakistan, s, side, of, punjab, and, only, a, tiny, muslim, population, remained, in, the, town, of, malerkotla, in, india, s, part, of, punjab, political, scientist, ishtiaq, ahmed, says, that, although, muslims, started, the, violence, in, punjab, by, the, end, of, 1947, more, muslims, had, been, killed, by, hindus, and, sikhs, in, east, punjab, than, the, number, of, hindus, and, sikhs, who, had, been, killed, by, muslims, in, west, punjab, more, than, ten, million, people, migrated, across, the, new, borders, and, between, 200, 000, and, 2, 000, 000, people, died, in, the, spate, of, communal, violence, in, the, punjab, in, what, some, scholars, have, described, as, a, retributive, genocide, between, the, religions, the, pakistani, government, claimed, that, 50, 000, muslim, women, were, abducted, and, raped, by, hindu, and, sikh, men, and, similarly, the, indian, government, claimed, that, muslims, abducted, and, raped, 33, 000, hindu, and, sikh, women, the, two, governments, agreed, to, repatriate, abducted, women, and, thousands, of, hindu, sikh, and, muslim, women, were, repatriated, to, their, families, in, the, 1950s, the, dispute, over, kashmir, escalated, into, the, first,
