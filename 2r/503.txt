cities, many, students, who, were, previously, red, guard, supported, the, movement, and, mao, s, vision, this, movement, was, thus, in, part, a, means, of, moving, red, guards, from, the, cities, to, the, countryside, where, they, would, cause, less, social, disruption, it, also, served, to, spread, revolutionary, ideology, geographically, the, 9th, national, congress, was, held, in, april, 1969, it, served, as, a, means, to, revitalize, the, party, with, fresh, thinking, as, well, as, new, cadres, after, much, of, the, old, guard, had, been, destroyed, in, the, struggles, of, the, preceding, years, 285, the, party, framework, established, two, decades, earlier, broke, down, almost, entirely, rather, than, through, an, election, by, party, members, delegates, for, this, congress, were, effectively, selected, by, revolutionary, committees, 288, representation, of, the, military, increased, by, a, large, margin, from, the, previous, congress, reflected, in, the, election, of, more, pla, members, to, the, new, central, committee, over, 28, 292, many, officers, now, elevated, to, senior, positions, were, loyal, to, pla, marshal, lin, biao, which, would, open, a, new, rift, between, the, military, and, civilian, leadership, 292, we, do, not, only, feel, boundless, joy, because, we, have, as, our, great, leader, the, greatest, marxist, leninist, of, our, era, chairman, mao, but, also, great, joy, because, we, have, vice, chairman, lin, as, chairman, mao, s, universally, recognized, successor, premier, zhou, enlai, at, the, 9th, party, congress, reflecting, this, lin, was, officially, elevated, to, become, the, party, s, preeminent, figure, outside, of, mao, with, his, name, written, into, the, party, constitution, as, his, closest, comrade, in, arms, and, universally, recognized, successor, 291, at, the, time, no, other, communist, parties, or, governments, anywhere, in, the, world, had, adopted, the, practice, of, enshrining, a, successor, to, the, current, leader, into, their, constitutions, lin, delivered, the, keynote, address, at, the, congress, a, document, drafted, by, hardliner, leftists, yao, wenyuan, and, zhang, chunqiao, under, mao, s, guidance, 289, the, report, was, heavily, critical, of, liu, shaoqi, and, other, counter, revolutionaries, and, drew, extensively, from, quotations, in, the, little, red, book, the, congress,

the, politburo, which, ceased, functioning, between, 1966, and, 1968, because, the, ccrg, held, de, facto, control, 296, in, early, 1970, the, nationwide, one, strike, three, anti, campaign, was, launched, by, mao, and, the, communist, party, central, aiming, to, consolidate, the, new, organs, of, power, by, targeting, counterrevolutionary, thoughts, and, actions, a, large, number, of, minor, criminals, were, executed, or, forced, to, commit, suicide, between, 1970, and, 1972, according, to, government, statistics, released, after, the, cultural, revolution, during, the, campaign, 1, 87, million, people, were, persecuted, as, traitors, spies, and, counterrevolutionaries, and, over, 284, 800, were, arrested, or, killed, from, february, to, november, 1970, alone, mao, s, efforts, at, re, organizing, party, and, state, institutions, generated, mixed, results, the, situation, in, some, of, the, provinces, remained, volatile, even, as, the, political, situation, in, beijing, stabilized, factional, struggles, many, violent, continued, at, a, local, level, despite, the, declaration, that, the, 9th, national, congress, marked, a, temporary, victory, for, the, cr, 316, furthermore, despite, mao, s, efforts, to, put, on, a, show, of, unity, at, the, congress, the, factional, divide, between, lin, s, pla, camp, and, the, jiang, led, radical, camp, was, intensifying, indeed, a, personal, dislike, of, jiang, drew, many, civilian, leaders, including, chen, closer, to, lin, 115, between, 1966, and, 1968, china, was, isolated, internationally, having, declared, its, enmity, towards, both, the, ussr, and, the, us, the, friction, with, the, ussr, intensified, after, border, clashes, on, the, ussuri, river, in, march, 1969, as, chinese, leaders, prepared, for, all, out, war, 317, in, june, 1969, the, pla, s, enforcement, of, political, discipline, and, suppression, of, the, factions, that, had, emerged, during, the, cultural, revolution, became, intertwined, with, the, central, party, s, efforts, to, accelerate, third, front, work, 150, those, who, did, not, return, to, work, would, be, viewed, as, engaging, in, schismatic, activity, which, risked, undermining, preparations, to, defend, china, from, potential, invasion, 150, 151, in, october, 1969, the, party, attempted, to, focus, more, on, war, preparedness, and, less, on, suppressing, factions, 151, that, month, senior, leaders, were, evacuated, from, beijing, 317, amidst, the, tension, lin, issued, what, appeared, to, be, an, executive, order, to, prepare, for, war, to, the, pla,

authority, 317, the, prospect, of, war, elevated, the, pla, to, greater, prominence, in, domestic, politics, increasing, lin, s, stature, at, mao, s, expense, 321, some, evidence, suggests, that, mao, was, pushed, to, seek, closer, relations, with, the, us, as, a, means, to, avoid, pla, dominance, that, would, result, from, a, military, confrontation, with, the, soviet, union, 321, during, his, later, meeting, with, richard, nixon, in, 1972, mao, hinted, that, lin, had, opposed, better, relations, with, the, u, s, 322, after, lin, was, confirmed, as, mao, s, successor, his, supporters, focused, on, the, restoration, of, the, position, of, state, chairman, which, had, been, abolished, by, mao, after, liu, s, purge, they, hoped, that, by, allowing, lin, to, ease, into, a, constitutionally, sanctioned, role, whether, chairman, or, vice, chairman, lin, s, succession, would, be, institutionalized, the, consensus, within, the, politburo, was, that, mao, should, assume, the, office, with, lin, as, vice, chairman, but, perhaps, wary, of, lin, s, ambitions, or, for, other, unknown, reasons, mao, voiced, his, explicit, opposition, 327, factional, rivalries, intensified,

ethnic, minority, although, senior, party, historians, corroborated, allegations, of, cannibalism, 259, violent, struggles, were, factional, conflicts, mostly, among, red, guards, and, rebel, groups, that, began, in, shanghai, and, then, spread, to, other, areas, in, 1967, they, brought, the, country, to, a, state, of, civil, war, weapons, used, included, some, 18, 77, million, guns, 2, 72,

violence, in, summer, 1967, dropped, sharply, after, august, when, mao, became, concerned, about, rebel, attacks, on, local, army, units, and, thereafter, made, clear, that, his, prior, calls, to,

official, interpretation, of, the, cultural, revolution, the, resolution, frankly, noted, mao, s, leadership, role, in, the, movement, stating, that, chief, responsibility, for, the, grave, left, error, of, the, cultural, revolution, an, error, comprehensive, in, magnitude, and, protracted, in, duration, does, indeed, lie, with, comrade, mao, zedong, it, diluted, blame, by, asserting, that,

actions, during, the, cultural, revolution, from, his, heroic, revolutionary, activities, during, the, chinese, civil, war, and, the, second, sino, japanese, war, it, also, separated, mao, s, personal, mistakes, from, the, correctness, of, the, theory, that, he, created, going, as, far, as, to, rationalize, that, the, cultural, revolution, contravened, the, spirit, of, mao, zedong,

independent, scholarly, research, is, discouraged, mao, zedong, s, legacy, remains, in, some, dispute, during, the, anniversary, of, his, birth, many, people, viewed, mao, as, a, godlike, figure, and, referred, to, him, as, the, people, s, great, savior, contemporary, discussions, in, newspapers, such, as, the, global, times, continue, to, glorify, mao, rather, than, focus, on, consequences, newspapers, claim, that, revolutions, typically, have, a, brutal, side, and, are, unable, to, be, viewed, from, the, humanitarian, perspective, critics, of, mao, zedong, look, at, the, actions, that, occurred, under, his, leadership, from, the, point, of, view, that, he, was, better, at, conquering, power, than, at, ruling, the, country, and, developing, a, socialist, economy, mao, went, to, extreme, measures, on, his, path, to, power, costing, millions, of, lives, then, and, during, his, rule, in, the, world, at, large, mao, zedong, emerged, as, a, symbol, of, anti, establishment,

he, regarded, as, the, destruction, of, traditional, chinese, values, by, mainland, communists, in, albania, communist, leader, and, chinese, ally, enver, hoxha, began, a, cultural, and, ideological, revolution, organized, along, the, same, lines, as, the, cultural, revolution, hoxha, delivered, a, speech, to, a, plenum, of, the, cc, of, the, party, of, labour, titled, some, preliminary, ideas, about, the, cultural, revolution, criticizing, it, he, said, that, the, cult, of, mao, was, raised, to, the, skies, in, a, sickening, and, artificial, manner, and, added, that, in, reading, its, purported, objectives, you, have, the, impression, that, everything, old, in, chinese, and, world, culture, should, be, rejected, without, discrimination, and, a, new, culture, the, culture, they, call, proletarian, should, be, created, he, further, stated, that, it, is, difficult, for, us, to, call, this, revolution, as, the, red, guards, are, carrying, it, out, a, proletarian, cultural, revolution, the, enemies, could, and, should, be, captured, by, the, organs, of, the, dictatorship, on, the, basis, of, the, law, and, if, the, enemies, have, wormed, their, way, into, the, party, committees, let, them, be, purged, through, party, channels, or, in, the, final, analysis, arm, the, working, class, and, attack, the, committees, but, not, with, children, in, october, 1966, chiang, kai, shek, criticized, the, cultural, revolution, as, a, synonym, for, mao, zedong, s, method, in, the, name, of, proletarian, revolution, after, failures, of, proletarian, revolution, general, route, great, leap, forward, people, s, commune, and, the, three, red, flags, he, claimed, that, maoism, lost, its, origins, in, marxism, leninism, and, mao, himself, dropped, his, marxist, leninist, mask, revealing, its, roots, in, huang, chao, li, zicheng, and, the, boxer, rebellion, destroying, chinese, culture, purging, intellectuals, destroying, modern, civilization, and, used, his, people, s, war, to, attempt, to, rule, asia, and, the, world, following, adolf, hitler, s, model, in, the, 1970s, nikita, khrushchev, criticized, the, cultural, revolution, in, his, memoir, he, saw, chinese, people, repeatedly, recite, mao, s, quotations, and, felt, sick, after, he, saw, human, dignity, trampled, he, argued, that, mao, is, not, supernatural, but, upended, his, country, and, that, the, cultural, revolution, was, actually, counter, revolutionary, in, 2007, hong, kong, chief, executive, donald, tsang, remarked, that, the, cultural, revolution, represented, the, dangers, of, democracy, remarking, people, can, go, to, the, extreme, like, what, we, saw, during, the, cultural, revolution, when, people, take, everything, into, their, own, hands, then, you, cannot, govern, the, place, the, remarks, caused, controversy, in, hong, kong, and, were, later, retracted, scholars, and, academics, debate, the, origin, the, events, mao, s, role, and, its, legacy, these, debates, evolved, as, researchers, explored, new, sources, in, the, 1960s, while, many, scholars, dismissed, mao, s, initiatives, as, ideological, and, destructive, others, sympathized, with, his, goals, they, saw, maoism, as, a, populist, insistence, on, mass, participation, mass, criticism, and, the, right, to, rebel, and, a, determination, to, wipe, out, a, new, ruling, class, by, the, 1980s, however, harvard, university, sociologist, andrew, walder, wrote, that, the, public, opinion, in, the, field, had, changed, markedly, most, in, the, field, now, seem, convinced, that, the, cultural, revolution, was, a, human, disaster, even, a, historical, crime, something, on, the, order, of, hitler, s, holocaust, and, stalin, s, great, terror, walder, argued, that, the, failures, of, the, cultural, revolution, did, not, come, from, poor, implementation, bureaucratic, sabotage, disloyalty, or, lingering, class, antagonisms, if, things, turned, out, differently, than, mao, expected, walder, concluded, this, was, probably, due, to, the, fact, that, mao, did, not, know, what, he, wanted, or, that, he, did, know, what, he, was, doing, or, both, the, outcomes, are, what, one, should, have, expected, given, the, maoist, doctrine, and, aims, the, debate, continues, because, the, movement, contains, many, contradictions, led, by, an, all, powerful, omnipresent, leader, it, was, mainly, driven, by, a, series, of, grassroots, popular, uprisings, many, english, language, books, published, since, the, 1980s, paint, a, negative, picture, of, the, movement, historian, anne, f, thurston, wrote, that, it, led, to, loss, of, culture, and, of, spiritual, values, loss, of, hope, and, ideals, loss, of, time, truth, and, of, life, barnouin, and, yu, summarized, the, cultural, revolution, as, a, political, movement, that, produced, unprecedented, social, divisions, mass, mobilization, hysteria, upheavals, arbitrary, cruelty, torture, killings, and, even, civil, war, calling, mao, one, of, the, most, tyrannical, despots, of, the, twentieth, century, 217, according, to, historian, chun, lin, despite, these, human, tragedies, individual, freedoms, and, political, self, organization, expanded, rapidly, some, scholars, challenge, the, mainstream, portrayals, and, conceive, it, in, a, more, positive, light, mobo, gao, writing, in, the, battle, for, china, s, past, mao, and, the, cultural, revolution, argues, that, the, movement, benefited, millions, of, chinese, citizens, particularly, agricultural, and, industrial, workers, 1, and, sees, it, as, egalitarian, and, genuinely, populist, citing, continued, maoist, nostalgia, today, as, remnants, of, its, positive, legacy, 3, some, draw, a, distinction, between, intention, and, performance, 159, while, mao, s, leadership, was, pivotal, at, the, beginning, of, the, movement, jin, qiu, contends, that, as, events, progressed, it, deviated, significantly, from, mao, s, utopian, vision, 2, 3, in, this, sense, the, cultural, revolution, was, actually, a, decentralized, and, varied, movement, that, gradually, lost, cohesion, spawning, many, local, revolutions, that, differed, in, their, nature, and, goals, 2, 3, academic, interest, focused, on, the, movement, s, relationship, with, mao, s, personality, mao, envisioned, himself, as, a, wartime, guerrilla, leader, which, made, him, wary, of, the, bureaucratic, nature, of, peacetime, governance, with, the, cultural, revolution, mao, was, simply, returning, to, form, once, again, acting, as, a, guerrilla, leader, fighting, an, institutionalized, bureaucracy, roderick, macfarquhar, and, michael, schoenhals, paint, the, movement, as, neither, a, bona, fide, war, over, ideological, purity, nor, a, mere, power, struggle, to, remove, mao, s, political, rivals, 2, 3, while, mao, s, personal, motivations, were, undoubtedly, pivotal, they, reasoned, that, other, factors, contributed, to, the, way, events, unfolded, these, include, china, s, relationship, with, the, global, communist, movement, geopolitical, concerns, the, ideological, rift, between, china, and, the, soviet, union, khrushchev, s, ouster, and, great, leap, forward, catastrophe, 2, 3, they, conclude, that, the, movement, was, at, least, in, part, a, legacy, project, to, cement, mao, s, place, in, history, aimed, to, boost, his, prestige, while, he, was, alive, and, preserve, his, ideas, after, his, death, 2, 3, varying, academic, focuses, on, power, conflicts, or, clashes, of, personalities, as, underlying, mao, s, motivations, or, alternatively, on, ideological, reasons, for, launching, the, cultural, revolution, are, not, necessarily, conflicting, 20, mao, s, suspicions, of, those, in, power, around, him, reflected, his, longstanding, concerns, with, the, decline, of, revolutionary, spirit, and, the, potential, rise, of, a, new, class, stratified, society, arising, as, the, popular, revolutionary, movement, transformed, into, a, socialist, bureaucracy, 20, historian, rebecca, karl, writes, that, for, mao, the, pursuit, of, power, was, never, an, end, in, itself, but, rather, the, seizure, of, state, power, was, to, be, used, in, making, the, revolution, professor, yiching, wu, argues, that, the, typical, historiography, of, the, cultural, revolution, as, an, era, of, madness, is, simpleminded, but, writes, that, such, narratives, have, a, remarkably, tenacious, ideological, power, 3, since, the, early, 1980s, there, have, been, concerted, efforts, to, reduce, the, extraordinary, complexity, of, the, cultural, revolution, to, the, simplicity, almost, exclusively, of, barbarism, violence, and, human, suffering, flattening, historical, memory, of, the, cultural, revolution, through, moralistic, condemnation, and, exhortation, these, narratives, not, only, deprive, an, immensely, important, and, complex, episode, of, chinese, history, of, its, multilayered, historicity, but, also, provide, the, discursive, ground, for, delegitimizing, china, s, revolutionary, history, of, the, twentieth, century, international, general
