the, indus, valley, civilisation, ivc, also, known, as, the, indus, civilisation, was, a, bronze, age, civilisation, in, the, northwestern, regions, of, south, asia, lasting, from, 3300, bce, to, 1300, bce, and, in, its, mature, form, from, 2600, bce, to, 1900, bce, together, with, ancient, egypt, and, mesopotamia, it, was, one, of, three, early, civilisations, of, the, near, east, and, south, asia, and, of, the, three, the, most, widespread, its, sites, spanning, an, area, including, much, of, modern, day, pakistan, northwestern, india, and, northeast, afghanistan, the, civilisation, flourished, both, in, the, alluvial, plain, of, the, indus, river, which, flows, through, the, length, of, pakistan, and, along, a, system, of, perennial, monsoon, fed, rivers, that, once, coursed, in, the, vicinity, of, the, ghaggar, hakra, a, seasonal, river, in, northwest, india, and, eastern, pakistan, the, term, harappan, is, sometimes, applied, to, the, indus, civilisation, after, its, type, site, harappa, the, first, to, be, excavated, early, in, the, 20th, century, in, what, was, then, the, punjab, province, of, british, india, and, is, now, punjab, pakistan, the, discovery, of, harappa, and, soon, afterwards, mohenjo, daro, was, the, culmination, of, work, that, had, begun, after, the, founding, of, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, in, the, british, raj, in, 1861, there, were, earlier, and, later, cultures, called, early, harappan, and, late, harappan, in, the, same, area, the, early, harappan, cultures, were, populated, from, neolithic, cultures, the, earliest, and, best, known, of, which, is, named, after, mehrgarh, in, balochistan, pakistan, harappan, civilisation, is, sometimes, called, mature, harappan, to, distinguish, it, from, the, earlier, cultures, the, cities, of, the, ancient, indus, were, noted, for, their, urban, planning, baked, brick, houses, elaborate, drainage, systems, water, supply, systems, clusters, of, large, non, residential, buildings, and, techniques, of, handicraft, and, metallurgy, mohenjo, daro, and, harappa, very, likely, grew, to, contain, between, 30, 000, and, 60, 000, individuals, and, the, civilisation, may, have, contained, between, one, and, five, million, individuals, during, its, florescence, a, gradual, drying, of, the, region, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, may, have, been, the, initial, stimulus, for, its, urbanisation, eventually, it, also, reduced, the, water, supply, enough, to, cause, the, civilisation, s, demise, and, to, disperse, its, population, to, the, east, although, over, a, thousand, mature, harappan, sites, have, been, reported, and, nearly, a, hundred, excavated, there, are, five, major, urban, centres, mohenjo, daro, in, the, lower, indus, valley, declared, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 1980, as, archaeological, ruins, at, moenjodaro, harappa, in, the, western, punjab, region, ganeriwala, in, the, cholistan, desert, dholavira, in, western, gujarat, declared, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 2021, as, dholavira, a, harappan, city, and, rakhigarhi, in, haryana, the, harappan, language, is, not, directly, attested, and, its, affiliations, are, uncertain, as, the, indus, script, has, remained, undeciphered, a, relationship, with, the, dravidian, or, elamo, dravidian, language, family, is, favoured, by, a, section, of, scholars, the, indus, civilisation, is, named, after, the, indus, river, system, in, whose, alluvial, plains, the, early, sites, of, the, civilisation, were, identified, and, excavated, following, a, tradition, in, archaeology, the, civilisation, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, harappan, after, its, type, site, harappa, the, first, site, to, be, excavated, in, the, 1920s, this, is, notably, true, of, usage, employed, by, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, after, india, s, independence, in, 1947, the, term, ghaggar, hakra, figures, prominently, in, modern, labels, applied, to, the, indus, civilisation, on, account, of, a, good, number, of, sites, having, been, found, along, the, ghaggar, hakra, river, in, northwest, india, and, eastern, pakistan, the, terms, indus, sarasvati, civilisation, and, sindhu, saraswati, civilisation, have, also, been, employed, in, the, literature, by, supporters, of, indigenous, aryanism, after, a, posited, identification, of, the, ghaggar, hakra, with, the, river, sarasvati, described, in, the, early, chapters, of, the, rigveda, a, collection, of, hymns, in, archaic, sanskrit, composed, in, the, second, millennium, bce, which, are, unrelated, to, the, mature, phase, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, recent, geophysical, research, suggests, that, unlike, the, sarasvati, described, in, the, rigveda, as, a, snow, fed, river, the, ghaggar, hakra, was, a, system, of, perennial, monsoon, fed, rivers, which, became, seasonal, around, the, time, that, the, civilisation, diminished, approximately, 4, 000, years, ago, the, indus, valley, civilisation, was, roughly, contemporary, with, the, other, riverine, civilisations, of, the, ancient, world, ancient, egypt, along, the, nile, mesopotamia, in, the, lands, watered, by, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, and, china, in, the, drainage, basin, of, the, yellow, river, and, the, yangtze, by, the, time, of, its, mature, phase, the, civilisation, had, spread, over, an, area, larger, than, the, others, which, included, a, core, of, 1, 500, kilometres, 900, mi, up, the, alluvial, plain, of, the, indus, and, its, tributaries, in, addition, there, was, a, region, with, disparate, flora, fauna, and, habitats, up, to, ten, times, as, large, which, had, been, shaped, culturally, and, economically, by, the, indus, around, 6500, bce, agriculture, emerged, in, balochistan, on, the, margins, of, the, indus, alluvium, in, the, following, millennia, settled, life, made, inroads, into, the, indus, plains, setting, the, stage, for, the, growth, of, rural, and, urban, settlements, the, more, organized, sedentary, life, in, turn, led, to, a, net, increase, in, the, birth, rate, the, large, urban, centres, of, mohenjo, daro, and, harappa, very, likely, grew, to, containing, between, 30, 000, and, 60, 000, individuals, and, during, the, civilisation, s, florescence, the, population, of, the, subcontinent, grew, to, between, 4, 6, million, people, during, this, period, the, death, rate, increased, as, the, close, living, conditions, of, humans, and, domesticated, animals, led, to, an, increase, in, contagious, diseases, according, to, one, estimate, the, population, of, the, indus, civilisation, at, its, peak, may, have, been, between, one, and, five, million, during, its, height, the, civilisation, extended, from, balochistan, in, the, west, to, western, uttar, pradesh, in, the, east, from, northeastern, afghanistan, in, the, north, to, gujarat, state, in, the, south, the, largest, number, of, sites, are, in, the, punjab, region, gujarat, haryana, rajasthan, uttar, pradesh, jammu, and, kashmir, states, sindh, and, balochistan, coastal, settlements, extended, from, sutkagan, dor, in, western, baluchistan, to, lothal, in, gujarat, an, indus, valley, site, has, been, found, on, the, oxus, river, at, shortugai, in, afghanistan, which, is, the, northernmost, site, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, in, the, gomal, river, valley, in, northwestern, pakistan, at, manda, jammu, on, the, beas, river, near, jammu, and, at, alamgirpur, on, the, hindon, river, only, 28, km, 17, mi, from, delhi, the, southernmost, site, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, is, daimabad, in, maharashtra, indus, valley, sites, have, been, found, most, often, on, rivers, but, also, on, the, ancient, seacoast, for, example, balakot, kot, bala, and, on, islands, for, example, dholavira, three, other, scholars, whose, names, i, cannot, pass, over, in, silence, are, the, late, mr, r, d, banerji, to, whom, belongs, the, credit, of, having, discovered, if, not, mohenjo, daro, itself, at, any, rate, its, high, antiquity, and, his, immediate, successors, in, the, task, of, excavation, messrs, m, s, vats, and, k, n, dikshit, no, one, probably, except, myself, can, fully, appreciate, the, difficulties, and, hardships, which, they, had, to, face, in, the, three, first, seasons, at, mohenjo, daro, from, john, marshall, ed, mohenjo, daro, and, the, indus, civilization, london, arthur, probsthain, 1931, the, first, modern, accounts, of, the, ruins, of, the, indus, civilisation, are, those, of, charles, masson, a, deserter, from, the, east, india, company, s, army, in, 1829, masson, traveled, through, the, princely, state, of, punjab, gathering, useful, intelligence, for, the, company, in, return, for, a, promise, of, clemency, an, aspect, of, this, arrangement, was, the, additional, requirement, to, hand, over, to, the, company, any, historical, artifacts, acquired, during, his, travels, masson, who, had, versed, himself, in, the, classics, especially, in, the, military, campaigns, of, alexander, the, great, chose, for, his, wanderings, some, of, the, same, towns, that, had, featured, in, alexander, s, campaigns, and, whose, archaeological, sites, had, been, noted, by, the, campaign, s, chroniclers, masson, s, major, archaeological, discovery, in, the, punjab, was, harappa, a, metropolis, of, the, indus, civilisation, in, the, valley, of, indus, s, tributary, the, ravi, river, masson, made, copious, notes, and, illustrations, of, harappa, s, rich, historical, artifacts, many, lying, half, buried, in, 1842, masson, included, his, observations, of, harappa, in, the, book, narrative, of, various, journeys, in, baluchistan, afghanistan, and, the, punjab, he, dated, the, harappa, ruins, to, a, period, of, recorded, history, erroneously, mistaking, it, to, have, been, described, earlier, during, alexander, s, campaign, masson, was, impressed, by, the, site, s, extraordinary, size, and, by, several, large, mounds, formed, from, long, existing, erosion, two, years, later, the, company, contracted, alexander, burnes, to, sail, up, the, indus, to, assess, the, feasibility, of, water, travel, for, its, army, burnes, who, also, stopped, in, harappa, noted, the, baked, bricks, employed, in, the, site, s, ancient, masonry, but, noted, also, the, haphazard, plundering, of, these, bricks, by, the, local, population, despite, these, reports, harappa, was, raided, even, more, perilously, for, its, bricks, after, the, british, annexation, of, the, punjab, in, 1848, 49, a, considerable, number, were, carted, away, as, track, ballast, for, the, railway, lines, being, laid, in, the, punjab, nearly, 160, km, 100, mi, of, railway, track, between, multan, and, lahore, laid, in, the, mid, 1850s, was, supported, by, harappan, bricks, in, 1861, three, years, after, the, dissolution, of, the, east, india, company, and, the, establishment, of, crown, rule, in, india, archaeology, on, the, subcontinent, became, more, formally, organised, with, the, founding, of, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, asi, alexander, cunningham, the, survey, s, first, director, general, who, had, visited, harappa, in, 1853, and, had, noted, the, imposing, brick, walls, visited, again, to, carry, out, a, survey, but, this, time, of, a, site, whose, entire, upper, layer, had, been, stripped, in, the, interim, although, his, original, goal, of, demonstrating, harappa, to, be, a, lost, buddhist, city, mentioned, in, the, seventh, century, ce, travels, of, the, chinese, visitor, xuanzang, proved, elusive, cunningham, did, publish, his, findings, in, 1875, for, the, first, time, he, interpreted, a, harappan, stamp, seal, with, its, unknown, script, which, he, concluded, to, be, of, an, origin, foreign, to, india, archaeological, work, in, harappa, thereafter, lagged, until, a, new, viceroy, of, india, lord, curzon, pushed, through, the, ancient, monuments, preservation, act, 1904, and, appointed, john, marshall, to, lead, the, asi, several, years, later, hiranand, sastri, who, had, been, assigned, by, marshall, to, survey, harappa, reported, it, to, be, of, non, buddhist, origin, and, by, implication, more, ancient, expropriating, harappa, for, the, asi, under, the, act, marshall, directed, asi, archaeologist, daya, ram, sahni, to, excavate, the, site, s, two, mounds, farther, south, along, the, main, stem, of, the, indus, in, sind, province, the, largely, undisturbed, site, of, mohenjo, daro, had, attracted, notice, marshall, deputed, a, succession, of, asi, officers, to, survey, the, site, these, included, d, r, bhandarkar, 1911, r, d, banerji, 1919, 1922, 1923, and, m, s, vats, 1924, in, 1923, on, his, second, visit, to, mohenjo, daro, baneriji, wrote, to, marshall, about, the, site, postulating, an, origin, in, remote, antiquity, and, noting, a, congruence, of, some, of, its, artifacts, with, those, of, harappa, later, in, 1923, vats, also, in, correspondence, with, marshall, noted, the, same, more, specifically, about, the, seals, and, the, script, found, at, both, sites, on, the, weight, of, these, opinions, marshall, ordered, crucial, data, from, the, two, sites, to, be, brought, to, one, location, and, invited, banerji, and, sahni, to, a, joint, discussion, by, 1924, marshall, had, become, convinced, of, the, significance, of, the, finds, and, on, 24, september, 1924, made, a, tentative, but, conspicuous, public, intimation, in, the, illustrated, london, news, not, often, has, it, been, given, to, archaeologists, as, it, was, given, to, schliemann, at, tiryns, and, mycenae, or, to, stein, in, the, deserts, of, turkestan, to, light, upon, the, remains, of, a, long, forgotten, civilisation, it, looks, however, at, this, moment, as, if, we, were, on, the, threshold, of, such, a, discovery, in, the, plains, of, the, indus, in, the, next, issue, a, week, later, the, british, assyriologist, archibald, sayce, was, able, to, point, to, very, similar, seals, found, in, bronze, age, levels, in, mesopotamia, and, iran, giving, the, first, strong, indication, of, their, date, confirmations, from, other, archaeologists, followed, systematic, excavations, began, in, mohenjo, daro, in, 1924, 25, with, that, of, k, n, dikshit, continuing, with, those, of, h, hargreaves, 1925, 1926, and, ernest, j, h, mackay, 1927, 1931, by, 1931, much, of, mohenjo, daro, had, been, excavated, but, occasional, excavations, continued, such, as, the, one, led, by, mortimer, wheeler, a, new, director, general, of, the, asi, appointed, in, 1944, and, including, ahmad, hasan, dani, after, the, partition, of, india, in, 1947, when, most, excavated, sites, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, lay, in, territory, awarded, to, pakistan, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, its, area, of, authority, reduced, carried, out, large, numbers, of, surveys, and, excavations, along, the, ghaggar, hakra, system, in, india, some, speculated, that, the, ghaggar, hakra, system, might, yield, more, sites, than, the, indus, river, basin, according, to, archaeologist, ratnagar, many, ghaggar, hakra, sites, in, india, and, indus, valley, sites, in, pakistan, are, actually, those, of, local, cultures, some, sites, display, contact, with, harappan, civilisation, but, only, a, few, are, fully, developed, harappan, ones, as, of, 1977, about, 90, of, the, indus, script, seals, and, inscribed, objects, discovered, were, found, at, sites, in, pakistan, along, the, indus, river, while, other, sites, accounts, only, for, the, remaining, 10, by, 2002, over, 1, 000, mature, harappan, cities, and, settlements, had, been, reported, of, which, just, under, a, hundred, had, been, excavated, mainly, in, the, general, region, of, the, indus, and, ghaggar, hakra, rivers, and, their, tributaries, however, there, are, only, five, major, urban, sites, harappa, mohenjo, daro, dholavira, ganeriwala, and, rakhigarhi, as, of, 2008, about, 616, sites, have, been, reported, in, india, whereas, 406, sites, have, been, reported, in, pakistan, unlike, india, in, which, after, 1947, the, asi, attempted, to, indianise, archaeological, work, in, keeping, with, the, new, nation, s, goals, of, national, unity, and, historical, continuity, in, pakistan, the, national, imperative, was, the, promotion, of, islamic, heritage, and, consequently, archaeological, work, on, early, sites, was, left, to, foreign, archaeologists, after, the, partition, mortimer, wheeler, the, director, of, asi, from, 1944, oversaw, the, establishment, of, archaeological, institutions, in, pakistan, later, joining, a, unesco, effort, tasked, to, conserve, the, site, at, mohenjo, daro, other, international, efforts, at, mohenjo, daro, and, harappa, have, included, the, german, aachen, research, project, mohenjo, daro, the, italian, mission, to, mohenjo, daro, and, the, us, harappa, archaeological, research, project, harp, founded, by, george, f, dales, following, a, chance, flash, flood, which, exposed, a, portion, of, an, archaeological, site, at, the, foot, of, the, bolan, pass, in, balochistan, excavations, were, carried, out, in, mehrgarh, by, french, archaeologist, jean, fran, ois, jarrige, and, his, team, in, the, early, 1970s, the, cities, of, the, ancient, indus, had, social, hierarchies, their, writing, system, their, large, planned, cities, and, their, long, distance, trade, mark, them, to, archaeologists, as, a, full, fledged, civilisation, the, mature, phase, of, the, harappan, civilisation, lasted, from, c, 2600, 1900, bce, with, the, inclusion, of, the, predecessor, and, successor, cultures, early, harappan, and, late, harappan, respectively, the, entire, indus, valley, civilisation, may, be, taken, to, have, lasted, from, the, 33rd, to, the, 14th, centuries, bce, it, is, part, of, the, indus, valley, tradition, which, also, includes, the, pre, harappan, occupation, of, mehrgarh, the, earliest, farming, site, of, the, indus, valley, several, periodisations, are, employed, for, the, ivc, the, most, commonly, used, classifies, the, indus, valley, civilisation, into, early, mature, and, late, harappan, phase, an, alternative, approach, by, shaffer, divides, the, broader, indus, valley, tradition, into, four, eras, the, pre, harappan, early, food, producing, era, and, the, regionalisation, integration, and, localisation, eras, which, correspond, roughly, with, the, early, harappan, mature, harappan, and, late, harappan, phases, mehrgarh, is, a, neolithic, 7000, bce, to, c, 2500, bce, mountain, site, in, the, balochistan, province, of, pakistan, which, gave, new, insights, on, the, emergence, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, mehrgarh, is, one, of, the, earliest, sites, with, evidence, of, farming, and, herding, in, south, asia, mehrgarh, was, influenced, by, the, near, eastern, neolithic, with, similarities, between, domesticated, wheat, varieties, early, phases, of, farming, pottery, other, archaeological, artefacts, some, domesticated, plants, and, herd, animals, jean, francois, jarrige, argues, for, an, independent, origin, of, mehrgarh, jarrige, notes, the, assumption, that, farming, economy, was, introduced, full, fledged, from, near, east, to, south, asia, and, the, similarities, between, neolithic, sites, from, eastern, mesopotamia, and, the, western, indus, valley, which, are, evidence, of, a, cultural, continuum, between, those, sites, but, given, the, originality, of, mehrgarh, jarrige, concludes, that, mehrgarh, has, an, earlier, local, background, and, is, not, a, backwater, of, the, neolithic, culture, of, the, near, east, lukacs, and, hemphill, suggest, an, initial, local, development, of, mehrgarh, with, a, continuity, in, cultural, development, but, a, change, in, population, according, to, lukacs, and, hemphill, while, there, is, a, strong, continuity, between, the, neolithic, and, chalcolithic, copper, age, cultures, of, mehrgarh, dental, evidence, shows, that, the, chalcolithic, population, did, not, descend, from, the, neolithic, population, of, mehrgarh, which, suggests, moderate, levels, of, gene, flow, mascarenhas, et, al, 2015, note, that, new, possibly, west, asian, body, types, are, reported, from, the, graves, of, mehrgarh, beginning, in, the, togau, phase, 3800, bce, gallego, romero, et, al, 2011, state, that, their, research, on, lactose, tolerance, in, india, suggests, that, the, west, eurasian, genetic, contribution, identified, by, reich, et, al, 2009, principally, reflects, gene, flow, from, iran, and, the, middle, east, they, further, note, that, he, earliest, evidence, of, cattle, herding, in, south, asia, comes, from, the, indus, river, valley, site, of, mehrgarh, and, is, dated, to, 7, 000, ybp, the, early, harappan, ravi, phase, named, after, the, nearby, ravi, river, lasted, from, c, 3300, bce, until, 2800, bce, it, started, when, farmers, from, the, mountains, gradually, moved, between, their, mountain, homes, and, the, lowland, river, valleys, and, is, related, to, the, hakra, phase, identified, in, the, ghaggar, hakra, river, valley, to, the, west, and, predates, the, kot, diji, phase, 2800, 2600, bce, harappan, 2, named, after, a, site, in, northern, sindh, pakistan, near, mohenjo, daro, the, earliest, examples, of, the, indus, script, date, to, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, the, mature, phase, of, earlier, village, cultures, is, represented, by, rehman, dheri, and, amri, in, pakistan, kot, diji, represents, the, phase, leading, up, to, mature, harappan, with, the, citadel, representing, centralised, authority, and, an, increasingly, urban, quality, of, life, another, town, of, this, stage, was, found, at, kalibangan, in, india, on, the, hakra, river, trade, networks, linked, this, culture, with, related, regional, cultures, and, distant, sources, of, raw, materials, including, lapis, lazuli, and, other, materials, for, bead, making, by, this, time, villagers, had, domesticated, numerous, crops, including, peas, sesame, seeds, dates, and, cotton, as, well, as, animals, including, the, water, buffalo, early, harappan, communities, turned, to, large, urban, centres, by, 2600, bce, from, where, the, mature, harappan, phase, started, the, latest, research, shows, that, indus, valley, people, migrated, from, villages, to, cities, the, final, stages, of, the, early, harappan, period, are, characterised, by, the, building, of, large, walled, settlements, the, expansion, of, trade, networks, and, the, increasing, integration, of, regional, communities, into, a, relatively, uniform, material, culture, in, terms, of, pottery, styles, ornaments, and, stamp, seals, with, indus, script, leading, into, the, transition, to, the, mature, harappan, phase, according, to, giosan, et, al, 2012, the, slow, southward, migration, of, the, monsoons, across, asia, initially, allowed, the, indus, valley, villages, to, develop, by, taming, the, floods, of, the, indus, and, its, tributaries, flood, supported, farming, led, to, large, agricultural, surpluses, which, in, turn, supported, the, development, of, cities, the, ivc, residents, did, not, develop, irrigation, capabilities, relying, mainly, on, the, seasonal, monsoons, leading, to, summer, floods, brooke, further, notes, that, the, development, of, advanced, cities, coincides, with, a, reduction, in, rainfall, which, may, have, triggered, a, reorganisation, into, larger, urban, centres, according, to, j, g, shaffer, and, d, a, lichtenstein, the, mature, harappan, civilisation, was, a, fusion, of, the, bagor, hakra, and, kot, diji, traditions, or, ethnic, groups, in, the, ghaggar, hakra, valley, on, the, borders, of, india, and, pakistan, also, according, to, a, more, recent, summary, by, maisels, 2003, the, harappan, oecumene, formed, from, a, kot, dijian, amri, nal, synthesis, he, also, says, that, in, the, development, of, complexity, the, site, of, mohenjo, daro, has, priority, along, with, the, hakra, ghaggar, cluster, of, sites, where, hakra, wares, actually, precede, the, kot, diji, related, material, he, sees, these, areas, as, catalytic, in, producing, the, fusion, from, hakra, kot, dijian, and, amri, nal, cultural, elements, that, resulted, in, the, gestalt, we, recognize, as, early, harappan, early, indus, by, 2600, bce, the, early, harappan, communities, turned, into, large, urban, centres, such, urban, centres, include, harappa, ganeriwala, mohenjo, daro, in, modern, day, pakistan, and, dholavira, kalibangan, rakhigarhi, rupar, and, lothal, in, modern, day, india, in, total, more, than, 1, 000, settlements, have, been, found, mainly, in, the, general, region, of, the,

first, urban, centre, in, the, region, the, quality, of, municipal, town, planning, suggests, the, knowledge, of, urban, planning, and, efficient, municipal, governments, which, placed, a, high, priority, on, hygiene, or, alternatively, accessibility, to, the, means, of, religious, ritual, as, seen, in, harappa, mohenjo, daro, and, the, recently, partially, excavated, rakhigarhi, this, urban,

housebuilding, in, some, villages, in, the, region, still, resembles, in, some, respects, the, housebuilding, of, the, harappans, the, ancient, indus, systems, of, sewerage, and, drainage, that, were, developed, and, used, in, cities, throughout, the, indus, region, were, far, more, advanced, than, any, found, in, contemporary, urban, sites, in, the, middle, east, and, even, more, efficient, than, those, in, many, areas, of, pakistan, and, india, today, the, advanced, architecture, of, the, harappans, is, shown, by, their, dockyards, granaries, warehouses, brick, platforms, and, protective, walls, the, massive, walls, of, indus, cities, most, likely, protected, the, harappans, from, floods, and, may, have, dissuaded, military, conflicts, the, purpose, of, the, citadel, remains, debated, in, sharp, contrast, to, this, civilisation, s, contemporaries, mesopotamia, and, ancient, egypt, no, large, monumental, structures, were, built, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, of, palaces, or, temples, some, structures, are, thought, to, have, been, granaries, found, at, one, city, is, an, enormous, well, built, bath, the, great, bath, which, may, have, been, a, public, bath, although, the, citadels, were, walled, it, is, far, from, clear, that, these, structures, were, defensive, most, city, dwellers, appear, to, have, been, traders, or, artisans, who, lived, with, others, pursuing, the, same, occupation, in, well, defined, neighbourhoods, materials, from, distant, regions, were, used, in, the, cities, for, constructing, seals, beads, and, other, objects, among, the, artefacts,

writing, system, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, some, of, the, seals, were, used, to, stamp, clay, on, trade, goods, although, some, houses, were, larger, than, others, indus, civilisation, cities, were, remarkable, for, their, apparent, if, relative, egalitarianism, all, the, houses, had, access, to, water, and, drainage, facilities, this, gives, the, impression, of, a, society, with, relatively, low, wealth, concentration, archaeological, records, provide, no, immediate, answers, for, a, centre, of, power, or, for, depictions, of, people, in, power, in, harappan, society, but, there, are, indications, of, complex, decisions, being, taken, and, implemented, for, instance, the, majority, of, the, cities, were, constructed, in, a, highly, uniform, and, well, planned, grid, pattern, suggesting, they, were, planned, by, a, central, authority, extraordinary, uniformity, of, harappan, artefacts, as, evident, in, pottery, seals, weights, and, bricks, presence, of, public, facilities, and, monumental, architecture, heterogeneity, in, the, mortuary, symbolism, and, in, grave, goods, items, included, in, burials, these, are, some, major, theories, harappans, evolved, some, new, techniques, in, metallurgy, and, produced, copper, bronze, lead, and, tin, a, touchstone, bearing, gold, streaks, was, found, in, banawali, which, was, probably, used, for, testing, the, purity, of, gold, such, a, technique, is, still, used, in, some, parts, of, india, the, people, of, the, indus, civilisation, achieved, great, accuracy, in, measuring, length, mass, and, time, they, were, among, the, first, to, develop, a, system, of, uniform, weights, and, measures, a, comparison, of, available, objects, indicates, large, scale, variation, across, the, indus, territories, their, smallest, division, which, is, marked, on, an, ivory, scale, found, in, lothal, in, gujarat, was, approximately, 1, 704, mm, the, smallest, division, ever, recorded, on, a, scale, of, the, bronze, age, harappan, engineers, followed, the, decimal, division, of, measurement, for, all, practical, purposes, including, the, measurement, of, mass, as, revealed, by, their, hexahedron, weights, these, chert, weights, were, in, a, ratio, of, 5, 2, 1, with, weights, of, 0, 05, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and, 500, units, with, each, unit, weighing, approximately, 28, grams, similar, to, the, english, imperial, ounce, or, greek, uncia, and, smaller, objects, were, weighed, in, similar, ratios, with, the, units, of, 0, 871, however, as, in, other, cultures, actual, weights, were, not, uniform, throughout, the, area, the, weights, and, measures, later, used, in, kautilya, s, arthashastra, 4th, century, bce, are, the, same, as, those, used, in, lothal, many, indus, valley, seals, and, items, in, pottery, and, terracotta, have, been, found, along, with, a, very, few, stone, sculptures, and, some, gold, jewellery, and, bronze, vessels, some, anatomically, detailed, figurines, in, terracotta, bronze, and, steatite, have, been, found, at, excavation, sites, the, former, probably, mostly, toys, the, harappans, also, made, various, toys, and, games, among, them, cubical, dice, with, one, to, six, holes, on, the, faces, which, were, found, in, sites, like, mohenjo, daro, the, terracotta, figurines, included, cows, bears, monkeys, and, dogs, the, animal, depicted, on, a, majority, of, seals, at, sites, of, the, mature, period, has, not, been, clearly, identified, part, bull, part, zebra, with, a, majestic, horn, it, has, been, a, source, of, speculation, as, yet, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, substantiate, claims, that, the, image, had, religious, or, cultic, significance, but, the, prevalence, of, the, image, raises, the, question, of, whether, or, not, the, animals, in, images, of, the, ivc, are, religious, symbols, many, crafts, including, shell, working, ceramics, and, agate, and, glazed, steatite, bead, making, were, practised, and, the, pieces, were, used, in, the, making, of, necklaces, bangles, and, other, ornaments, from, all, phases, of, harappan, culture, some, of, these, crafts, are, still, practised, in, the, subcontinent, today, some, make, up, and, toiletry, items, a, special, kind, of, combs, kakai, the, use, of, collyrium, and, a, special, three, in, one, toiletry, gadget, that, were, found, in, harappan, contexts, still, have, similar, counterparts, in, modern, india, terracotta, female, figurines, were, found, c, 2800, 2600, bce, which, had, red, colour, applied, to, the, manga, line, of, partition, of, the, hair, archeological, remains, from, 2000, to, 3000, bc, have, been, found, from, the, city, of, lothal, of, pieces, on, a, board, that, resemble, chess, the, finds, from, mohenjo, daro, were, initially, deposited, in, the, lahore, museum, but, later, moved, to, the, asi, headquarters, at, new, delhi, where, a, new, central, imperial, museum, was, being, planned, for, the, new, capital, of, the, british, raj, in, which, at, least, a, selection, would, be, displayed, it, became, apparent, that, indian, independence, was, approaching, but, the, partition, of, india, was, not, anticipated, until, late, in, the, process, the, new, pakistani, authorities, requested, the, return, of, the, mohenjo, daro, pieces, excavated, on, their, territory, but, the, indian, authorities, refused, eventually, an, agreement, was, reached, whereby, the, finds, totalling, some, 12, 000, objects, most, sherds, of, pottery, were, split, equally, between, the, countries, in, some, cases, this, was, taken, very, literally, with, some, necklaces, and, girdles, having, their, beads, separated, into, two, piles, in, the, case, of, the, two, most, celebrated, sculpted, figures, pakistan, asked, for, and, received, the, so, called, priest, king, figure, while, india, retained, the, much, smaller, dancing, girl, though, written, considerably, later, the, arts, treatise, natya, shastra, c, 200, bce, 200, ce, classifies, musical, instruments, into, four, groups, based, on, their, means, of, acoustical, production, strings, membranes, solid, materials, and, air, and, it, is, probable, that, such, instruments, had, existed, since, the, ivc, archeological, evidence, indicates, the, use, of, simple, rattles, and, vessel, flutes, while, iconographical, evidence, suggests, early, harps, and, drums, were, also, used, an, ideogram, in, the, ivc, contains, the, earliest, known, depiction, of, an, arched, harp, dated, sometime, before, 1800, bce, a, handful, of, realistic, statuettes, have, been, found, at, ivc, sites, of, which, much, the, most, famous, is, the, lost, wax, casting, bronze, statuette, of, a, slender, limbed, dancing, girl, adorned, with, bangles, found, in, mohenjo, daro, two, other, realistic, incomplete, statuettes, have, been, found, in, harappa, in, proper, stratified, excavations, which, display, near, classical, treatment, of, the, human, shape, the, statuette, of, a, dancer, who, seems, to, be, male, and, the, harappa, torso, a, red, jasper, male, torso, both, now, in, the, delhi, national, museum, sir, john, marshall, reacted, with, surprise, when, he, saw, these, two, statuettes, from, harappa, when, i, first, saw, them, i, found, it, difficult, to, believe, that, they, were, prehistoric, they, seemed, to, completely, upset, all, established, ideas, about, early, art, and, culture, modelling, such, as, this, was, unknown, in, the, ancient, world, up, to, the, hellenistic, age, of, greece, and, i, thought, therefore, that, some, mistake, must, surely, have, been, made, that, these, figures, had, found, their, way, into, levels, some, 3000, years, older, than, those, to, which, they, properly, belonged, now, in, these, statuettes, it, is, just, this, anatomical, truth, which, is, so, startling, that, makes, us, wonder, whether, in, this, all, important, matter, greek, artistry, could, possibly, have, been, anticipated, by, the, sculptors, of, a, far, off, age, on, the, banks, of, the, indus, these, statuettes, remain, controversial, due, to, their, advanced, style, in, representing, the, human, body, regarding, the, red, jasper, torso, the, discoverer, vats, claims, a, harappan, date, but, marshall, considered, this, statuette, is, probably, historical, dating, to, the, gupta, period, comparing, it, to, the, much, later, lohanipur, torso, a, second, rather, similar, grey, stone, torso, of, a, dancing, male, was, also, found, about, 150, meters, away, in, a, secure, mature, harappan, stratum, overall, anthropologist, gregory, possehl, tends, to, consider, that, these, statuettes, probably, form, the, pinnacle, of, indus, art, during, the, mature, harappan, period, thousands, of, steatite, seals, have, been, recovered, and, their, physical, character, is, fairly, consistent, in, size, they, range, from, squares, of, side, 2, to, 4, cm, 3, 4, to, 1, 1, 2, in, in, most, cases, they, have, a, pierced, boss, at, the, back, to, accommodate, a, cord, for, handling, or, for, use, as, personal, adornment, in, addition, a, large, number, of, sealings, have, survived, of, which, only, a, few, can, be, matched, to, the, seals, the, great, majority, of, examples, of, the, indus, script, are, short, groups, of, signs, on, seals, seals, have, been, found, at, mohenjo, daro, depicting, a, figure, standing, on, its, head, and, another, on, the, pashupati, seal, sitting, cross, legged, in, what, some, call, a, yoga, like, pose, see, image, the, so, called, pashupati, below, this, figure, has, been, variously, identified, sir, john, marshall, identified, a, resemblance, to, the, hindu, god, shiva, a, human, deity, with, the, horns, hooves, and, tail, of, a, bull, also, appears, in, the, seals, in, particular, in, a, fighting, scene, with, a, horned, tiger, like, beast, this, deity, has, been, compared, to, the, mesopotamian, bull, man, enkidu, several, seals, also, show, a, man, fighting, two, lions, or, tigers, a, master, of, animals, motif, common, to, civilisations, in, western, and, south, asia, the, indus, valley, civilisation, may, have, had, bullock, carts, identical, to, those, seen, throughout, south, asia, today, as, well, as, boats, most, of, these, boats, were, probably, small, flat, bottomed, craft, perhaps, driven, by, sail, similar, to, those, one, can, see, on, the, indus, river, today, an, extensive, canal, network, used, for, irrigation, has, however, also, been, discovered, by, h, p, francfort, during, 4300, 3200, bce, of, the, chalcolithic, period, copper, age, the, indus, valley, civilisation, area, shows, ceramic, similarities, with, southern, turkmenistan, and, northern, iran, which, suggest, considerable, mobility, and, trade, during, the, early, harappan, period, about, 3200, 2600, bce, similarities, in, pottery, seals, figurines, ornaments, etc, document, intensive, caravan, trade, with, central, asia, and, the, iranian, plateau, judging, from, the, dispersal, of, indus, civilisation, artefacts, the, trade, networks, economically, integrated, a, huge, area, including, portions, of, afghanistan, the, coastal, regions, of, persia, connected, by, the, gulf, of, oman, from, the, arabian, sea, northern, and, western, india, and, mesopotamia, leading, to, the, development, of, indus, mesopotamia, relations, studies, of, tooth, enamel, from, individuals, buried, at, harappa, suggest, that, some, residents, had, migrated, to, the, city, from, beyond, the, indus, valley, ancient, dna, studies, of, graves, at, bronze, age, sites, at, gonur, depe, turkmenistan, and, shahr, e, sukhteh, iran, have, identified, 11, individuals, of, south, asian, descent, who, are, presumed, to, be, of, mature, indus, valley, origin, there, was, an, extensive, maritime, trade, network, operating, between, the, harappan, and, mesopotamian, civilisations, as, early, as, the, middle, harappan, phase, with, much, commerce, being, handled, by, middlemen, merchants, from, dilmun, modern, bahrain, eastern, arabia, and, failaka, located, in, the, persian, gulf, such, long, distance, sea, trade, became, feasible, with, the, development, of, plank, built, watercraft, equipped, with, a, single, central, mast, supporting, a, sail, of, woven, rushes, or, cloth, however, the, evidence, of, sea, borne, trade, involving, the, harappan, civilisation, is, not, firm, in, their, book, rise, of, civilization, in, india, and, pakistan, archaeologists, bridget, allchin, and, raymond, allchin, write, p, 173, the, settlement, at, lothal, along, the, east, side, was, a, brick, basin, it, is, claimed, by, its, excavator, to, have, been, a, dockyard, connected, by, channels, to, a, neighbouring, estuary, on, its, edge, the, excavator, discovered, several, heavily, pierced, stones, similar, to, modern, anchor, stones, employed, by, traditional, seafaring, communities, of, western, india, this, interpretation, however, has, been, challenged, and, indeed, the, published, levels, of, the, basin, and, its, entrance, relative, to, the, modern, sea, level, seem, to, argue, against, it, leshnik, has, cogently, suggested, that, it, was, a, tank, for, the, reception, of, sweet, water, channelled, from, higher, ground, inland, to, an, area, where, the, local, water, supplies, were, anciently, as, still, today, saline, we, regard, either, interpretation, as, still, unproven, but, favour, the, latter, p, 188, 189, the, discussion, of, trade, focuses, attention, upon, methods, of, transport, several, representations, of, ships, are, found, on, seals, and, graffiti, at, harappa, mohenjo, daro, figs, 7, 15, 7, 16, etc, and, a, terracotta, model, of, a, ship, with, a, stick, impressed, socket, for, the, mast, and, eyeholes, for, fixing, rigging, comes, from, lothal, we, have, already, seen, above, that, the, great, brick, tank, interpreted, by, rao, as, a, dock, at, lothal, cannot, yet, be, certainly, identified, the, evidence, of, sea, trade, and, contact, during, the, harappan, period, is, largely, circumstantial, or, derived, from, inferences, from, the, mesopotamian, texts, as, detailed, above, figure, 7, 15, had, caption, mohenjo, daro, representation, of, ship, on, a, stone, seal, length, 4, 3, cm, after, mackay, figure, 7, 16, mohenjo, daro, representation, of, ship, on, terracotta, amulet, length, 4, 5, cm, after, dales, daniel, t, potts, writes, it, is, generally, assumed, that, most, trade, between, the, indus, valley, ancient, meluhha, and, western, neighbors, proceeded, up, the, persian, gulf, rather, than, overland, although, there, is, no, incontrovertible, proof, that, this, was, indeed, the, case, the, distribution, of, indus, type, artifacts, on, the, oman, peninsula, on, bahrain, and, in, southern, mesopotamia, makes, it, plausible, that, a, series, of, maritime, stages, linked, the, indus, valley, and, the, gulf, region, if, this, is, accepted, then, the, presence, of, etched, carnelian, beads, a, harappan, style, cubical, stone, weight, and, a, harappan, style, cylinder, seal, at, susa, amiet, 1986a, figs, 92, 94, may, be, evidence, of, maritime, trade, between, susa, and, the, indus, valley, in, the, late, 3rd, millennium, bce, on, the, other, hand, given, that, similar, finds, particularly, etched, carnelian, beads, are, attested, at, landlocked, sites, including, tepe, hissar, tappe, he, r, shah, tepe, h, tappe, kalleh, nisar, kalla, nis, r, jalalabad, jal, l, b, d, marlik, m, rlik, and, tepe, yahya, tappe, ya, y, possehl, 1996, pp, 153, 54, other, mechanisms, including, overland, traffic, by, peddlers, or, caravans, may, account, for, their, presence, at, susa, in, the, 1980s, important, archaeological, discoveries, were, made, at, ras, al, jinz, oman, demonstrating, maritime, indus, valley, connections, with, the, arabian, peninsula, dennys, frenez, recently, regards, that, indus, type, and, indus, related, artifacts, were, found, over, a, large, and, differentiated, ecumene, encompassing, central, asia, the, iranian, plateau, mesopotamia, and, the, northern, levant, the, persian, gulf, and, the, oman, peninsula, the, discovery, of, indus, trade, tools, seals, weights, and, containers, across, the, entire, middle, asia, complemented, by, information, from, mesopotamian, cuneiform, texts, shows, that, entrepreneurs, from, the, indus, valley, regularly, ventured, into, these, regions, to, transact, with, the, local, socioeconomic, and, political, entities, however, indus, artifacts, were, also, exchanged, beyond, this, core, region, eventually, reaching, as, far, the, nile, river, valley, anatolia, and, the, caucasus, on, the, contrary, only, a, handful, of, exotic, trade, tools, and, commodities, have, been, found, at, sites, in, the, greater, indus, valley, the, success, of, indus, trade, in, central, and, western, asia, did, not, only, rely, on, the, dynamic, entrepreneurialism, of, indus, merchants, and, the, exotic, commodities, they, offered, specific, products, were, proactively, designed, and, manufactured, in, the, indus, valley, to, fulfill, the, particular, needs, of, foreign, markets, and, indus, craftspeople, moved, beyond, their, native, cultural, sphere, adapting, their, distinctive, productions, to, the, taste, of, foreign, elites, or, reworking, indigenous, models, the, adoption, of, specific, seals, and, iconographies, to, regulate, external, trade, activities, suggests, a, conscious, attempt, at, implementing, a, coordinated, supraregional, marketing, strategy, according, to, gangal, et, al, 2014, there, is, strong, archeological, and, geographical, evidence, that, neolithic, farming, spread, from, the, near, east, into, north, west, india, but, there, is, also, good, evidence, for, the, local, domestication, of, barley, and, the, zebu, cattle, at, mehrgarh, according, to, jean, francois, jarrige, farming, had, an, independent, local, origin, at, mehrgarh, which, he, argues, is, not, merely, a, backwater, of, the, neolithic, culture, of, the, near, east, despite, similarities, between, neolithic, sites, from, eastern, mesopotamia, and, the, western, indus, valley, which, are, evidence, of, a, cultural, continuum, between, those, sites, archaeologist, jim, g, shaffer, writes, that, the, mehrgarh, site, demonstrates, that, food, production, was, an, indigenous, south, asian, phenomenon, and, that, the, data, support, interpretation, of, the, prehistoric, urbanisation, and, complex, social, organisation, in, south, asia, as, based, on, indigenous, but, not, isolated, cultural, developments, jarrige, notes, that, the, people, of, mehrgarh, used, domesticated, wheats, and, barley, while, shaffer, and, liechtenstein, note, that, the, major, cultivated, cereal, crop, was, naked, six, row, barley, a, crop, derived, from, two, row, barley, gangal, agrees, that, neolithic, domesticated, crops, in, mehrgarh, include, more, than, 90, barley, noting, that, there, is, good, evidence, for, the, local, domestication, of, barley, yet, gangal, also, notes, that, the, crop, also, included, a, small, amount, of, wheat, which, are, suggested, to, be, of, near, eastern, origin, as, the, modern, distribution, of, wild, varieties, of, wheat, is, limited, to, northern, levant, and, southern, turkey, the, cattle, that, are, often, portrayed, on, indus, seals, are, humped, indian, aurochs, bos, primigenius, namadicus, which, are, similar, to, zebu, cattle, zebu, cattle, are, still, common, in, india, and, in, africa, they, are, different, from, european, cattle, bos, primigenius, taurus, and, are, believed, to, have, been, independently, domesticated, on, the, indian, subcontinent, probably, in, the, baluchistan, region, of, pakistan, research, by, j, bates, et, al, 2016, confirms, that, indus, populations, were, the, earliest, people, to, use, complex, multi, cropping, strategies, across, both, seasons, growing, foods, during, summer, rice, millets, and, beans, and, winter, wheat, barley, and, pulses, which, required, different, watering, regimes, bates, et, al, 2016, also, found, evidence, for, an, entirely, separate, domestication, process, of, rice, in, ancient, south, asia, based, around, the, wild, species, oryza, nivara, this, led, to, the, local, development, of, a, mix, of, wetland, and, dryland, agriculture, of, local, oryza, sativa, indica, rice, agriculture, before, the, truly, wetland, rice, oryza, sativa, japonica, arrived, around, 2000, bce, according, to, archeological, finds, the, indus, valley, civilisation, had, a, diet, dominated, by, meats, of, animals, such, as, cattle, buffalo, goat, pig, and, chicken, remnants, of, dairy, products, were, also, discovered, according, to, akshyeta, suryanarayan, et, al, available, evidence, indicates, culinary, practices, to, be, common, over, the, region, food, constituents, were, dairy, products, in, low, proportion, ruminant, carcass, meat, and, either, non, ruminant, adipose, fats, plants, or, mixtures, of, these, products, the, dietary, pattern, remained, same, throughout, the, decline, seven, food, balls, laddus, were, found, in, intact, form, along, with, two, figurines, of, bulls, and, a, hand, held, copper, adze, during, excavations, in, 2017, from, western, rajasthan, dated, to, about, 2600, bce, they, were, likely, composed, of, legumes, primarily, mung, and, cereals, the, authors, speculated, the, food, balls, to, be, of, a, ritualistic, significance, given, the, finds, of, bull, figurines, adze, and, a, seal, in, immediate, vicinity, it, has, often, been, suggested, that, the, bearers, of, the, ivc, corresponded, to, proto, dravidians, linguistically, the, break, up, of, proto, dravidian, corresponding, to, the, break, up, of, the, late, harappan, culture, finnish, indologist, asko, parpola, concludes, that, the, uniformity, of, the, indus, inscriptions, precludes, any, possibility, of, widely, different, languages, being, used, and, that, an, early, form, of, dravidian, language, must, have, been, the, language, of, the, indus, people, today, the, dravidian, language, family, is, concentrated, mostly, in, southern, india, and, northern, and, eastern, sri, lanka, but, pockets, of, it, still, remain, throughout, the, rest, of, india, and, pakistan, the, brahui, language, which, lends, credence, to, the, theory, according, to, heggarty, and, renfrew, dravidian, languages, may, have, spread, into, the, indian, subcontinent, with, the, spread, of, farming, according, to, david, mcalpin, the, dravidian, languages, were, brought, to, india, by, immigration, into, india, from, elam, in, earlier, publications, renfrew, also, stated, that, proto, dravidian, was, brought, to, india, by, farmers, from, the, iranian, part, of, the, fertile, crescent, but, more, recently, heggarty, and, renfrew, note, that, a, great, deal, remains, to, be, done, in, elucidating, the, prehistory, of, dravidian, they, also, note, that, mcalpin, s, analysis, of, the, language, data, and, thus, his, claims, remain, far, from, orthodoxy, heggarty, and, renfrew, conclude, that, several, scenarios, are, compatible, with, the, data, and, that, the, linguistic, jury, is, still, very, much, out, in, a, 2021, study, bahata, ansumali, mukhopadhyay, presented, a, linguistic, analysis, to, posit, a, proto, dravidian, presence, in, the, ancient, indus, area, using, dravidian, root, words, for, tooth, toothbrush, and, elephant, in, various, contemporary, ancient, civilisations, between, 400, and, as, many, as, 600, distinct, indus, symbols, have, been, found, on, stamp, seals, small, tablets, ceramic, pots, and, more, than, a, dozen, other, materials, including, a, signboard, that, apparently, once, hung, over, the, gate, of, the, inner, citadel, of, the, indus, city, of, dholavira, typical, indus, inscriptions, are, around, five, characters, in, length, most, of, which, aside, from, the, dholavira, signboard, are, tiny, the, longest, on, any, single, object, inscribed, on, a, copper, plate, has, a, length, of, 34, symbols, while, the, indus, valley, civilisation, is, generally, characterised, as, a, literate, society, on, the, evidence, of, these, inscriptions, this, description, has, been, challenged, by, farmer, sproat, and, witzel, 2004, who, argue, that, the, indus, system, did, not, encode, language, but, was, instead, similar, to, a, variety, of, non, linguistic, sign, systems, used, extensively, in, the, near, east, and, other, societies, to, symbolise, families, clans, gods, and, religious, concepts, others, have, claimed, on, occasion, that, the, symbols, were, exclusively, used, for, economic, transactions, but, this, claim, leaves, unexplained, the, appearance, of, indus, symbols, on, many, ritual, objects, many, of, which, were, mass, produced, in, moulds, no, parallels, to, these, mass, produced, inscriptions, are, known, in, any, other, early, ancient, civilisations, in, a, 2009, study, by, p, n, rao, et, al, published, in, science, computer, scientists, comparing, the, pattern, of, symbols, to, various, linguistic, scripts, and, non, linguistic, systems, including, dna, and, a, computer, programming, language, found, that, the, indus, script, s, pattern, is, closer, to, that, of, spoken, words, supporting, the, hypothesis, that, it, codes, for, an, as, yet, unknown, language, farmer, sproat, and, witzel, have, disputed, this, finding, pointing, out, that, rao, et, al, did, not, actually, compare, the, indus, signs, with, real, world, non, linguistic, systems, but, rather, with, two, wholly, artificial, systems, invented, by, the, authors, one, consisting, of, 200, 000, randomly, ordered, signs, and, another, of, 200, 000, fully, ordered, signs, that, they, spuriously, claim, represent, the, structures, of, all, real, world, non, linguistic, sign, systems, farmer, et, al, have, also, demonstrated, that, a, comparison, of, a, non, linguistic, system, like, medieval, heraldic, signs, with, natural, languages, yields, results, similar, to, those, that, rao, et, al, obtained, with, indus, signs, they, conclude, that, the, method, used, by, rao, et, al, cannot, distinguish, linguistic, systems, from, non, linguistic, ones, the, messages, on, the, seals, have, proved, to, be, too, short, to, be, decoded, by, a, computer, each, seal, has, a, distinctive, combination, of, symbols, and, there, are, too, few, examples, of, each, sequence, to, provide, a, sufficient, context, the, symbols, that, accompany, the, images, vary, from, seal, to, seal, making, it, impossible, to, derive, a, meaning, for, the, symbols, from, the, images, there, have, nonetheless, been, a, number, of, interpretations, offered, for, the, meaning, of, the, seals, these, interpretations, have, been, marked, by, ambiguity, and, subjectivity, 69, photos, of, many, of, the, thousands, of, extant, inscriptions, are, published, in, the, corpus, of, indus, seals, and, inscriptions, 1987, 1991, 2010, edited, by, asko, parpola, and, his, colleagues, the, most, recent, volume, republished, photos, taken, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, of, hundreds, of, lost, or, stolen, inscriptions, along, with, many, discovered, in, the, last, few, decades, formerly, researchers, had, to, supplement, the, materials, in, the, corpus, by, study, of, the, tiny, photos, in, the, excavation, reports, of, marshall, 1931, mackay, 1938, 1943, wheeler, 1947, or, reproductions, in, more, recent, scattered, sources, the, religion, and, belief, system, of, the, indus, valley, people, has, received, considerable, attention, especially, from, the, view, of, identifying, precursors, to, deities, and, religious, practices, of, indian, religions, that, later, developed, in, the, area, however, due, to, the, sparsity, of, evidence, which, is, open, to, varying, interpretations, and, the, fact, that, the, indus, script, remains, undeciphered, the, conclusions, are, partly, speculative, and, largely, based, on, a, retrospective, view, from, a, much, later, hindu, perspective, early, and, influential, work, in, the, area, that, set, the, trend, for, hindu, interpretations, of, archaeological, evidence, from, the, harappan, sites, was, that, of, john, marshall, who, in, 1931, identified, the, following, as, prominent, features, of, the, indus, religion, a, great, male, god, and, a, mother, goddess, deification, or, veneration, of, animals, and, plants, a, symbolic, representation, of, the, phallus, linga, and, vulva, yoni, and, use, of, baths, and, water, in, religious, practice, marshall, s, interpretations, have, been, much, debated, and, sometimes, disputed, over, the, following, decades, one, indus, valley, seal, shows, a, seated, figure, with, a, horned, headdress, possibly, tricephalic, and, possibly, ithyphallic, surrounded, by, animals, marshall, identified, the, figure, as, an, early, form, of, the, hindu, god, shiva, or, rudra, who, is, associated, with, asceticism, yoga, and, linga, regarded, as, a, lord, of, animals, and, often, depicted, as, having, three, eyes, the, seal, has, hence, come, to, be, known, as, the, pashupati, seal, after, pashupati, lord, of, all, animals, an, epithet, of, shiva, while, marshall, s, work, has, earned, some, support, many, critics, and, even, supporters, have, raised, several, objections, doris, srinivasan, has, argued, that, the, figure, does, not, have, three, faces, or, yogic, posture, and, that, in, vedic, literature, rudra, was, not, a, protector, of, wild, animals, herbert, sullivan, and, alf, hiltebeitel, also, rejected, marshall, s, conclusions, with, the, former, claiming, that, the, figure, was, female, while, the, latter, associated, the, figure, with, mahisha, the, buffalo, god, and, the, surrounding, animals, with, vahanas, vehicles, of, deities, for, the, four, cardinal, directions, writing, in, 2002, gregory, l, possehl, concluded, that, while, it, would, be, appropriate, to, recognise, the, figure, as, a, deity, its, association, with, the, water, buffalo, and, its, posture, as, one, of, ritual, discipline, regarding, it, as, a, proto, shiva, would, be, going, too, far, despite, the, criticisms, of, marshall, s, association, of, the, seal, with, a, proto, shiva, icon, it, has, been, interpreted, as, the, tirthankara, rishabhanatha, by, some, scholars, of, jainism, like, vilas, sangave, historians, such, as, heinrich, zimmer, and, thomas, mcevilley, believe, that, there, is, a, connection, between, first, jain, tirthankara, rishabhanatha, and, the, indus, valley, civilisation, marshall, hypothesised, the, existence, of, a, cult, of, mother, goddess, worship, based, upon, excavation, of, several, female, figurines, and, thought, that, this, was, a, precursor, of, the, hindu, sect, of, shaktism, however, the, function, of, the, female, figurines, in, the, life, of, indus, valley, people, remains, unclear, and, possehl, does, not, regard, the, evidence, for, marshall, s, hypothesis, to, be, terribly, robust, some, of, the, baetyls, interpreted, by, marshall, to, be, sacred, phallic, representations, are, now, thought, to, have, been, used, as, pestles, or, game, counters, instead, while, the, ring, stones, that, were, thought, to, symbolise, yoni, were, determined, to, be, architectural, features, used, to, stand, pillars, although, the, possibility, of, their, religious, symbolism, cannot, be, eliminated, many, indus, valley, seals, show, animals, with, some, depicting, them, being, carried, in, processions, while, others, show, chimeric, creations, one, seal, from, mohenjo, daro, shows, a, half, human, a, half, buffalo, monster, attacking, a, tiger, which, may, be, a, reference, to, the, sumerian, myth, of, such, a, monster, created, by, goddess, aruru, to, fight, gilgamesh, in, contrast, to, contemporary, egyptian, and, mesopotamian, civilisations, indus, valley, lacks, any, monumental, palaces, even, though, excavated, cities, indicate, that, the, society, possessed, the, requisite, engineering, knowledge, this, may, suggest, that, religious, ceremonies, if, any, may, have, been, largely, confined, to, individual, homes, small, temples, or, the, open, air, several, sites, have, been, proposed, by, marshall, and, later, scholars, as, possibly, devoted, to, religious, purposes, but, at, present, only, the, great, bath, at, mohenjo, daro, is, widely, thought, to, have, been, so, used, as, a, place, for, ritual, purification, the, funerary, practices, of, the, harappan, civilisation, are, marked, by, fractional, burial, in, which, the, body, is, reduced, to, skeletal, remains, by, exposure, to, the, elements, before, final, interment, and, even, cremation, around, 1900, bce, signs, of, a, gradual, decline, began, to, emerge, and, by, around, 1700, bce, most, of, the, cities, had, been, abandoned, examination, of, human, skeletons, from, the, site, of, harappa, in, the, 2010s, demonstrated, that, the, end, of, the, indus, civilisation, saw, an, increase, in, inter, personal, violence, and, in, infectious, diseases, like, leprosy, and, tuberculosis, according, to, historian, upinder, singh, the, general, picture, presented, by, the, late, harappan, phase, is, one, of, a, breakdown, of, urban, networks, and, an, expansion, of, rural, ones, during, the, period, of, approximately, 1900, to, 1700, bce, multiple, regional, cultures, emerged, within, the, area, of, the, indus, civilisation, the, cemetery, h, culture, was, in, punjab, haryana, and, western, uttar, pradesh, the, jhukar, culture, was, in, sindh, and, the, rangpur, culture, characterised, by, lustrous, red, ware, pottery, was, in, gujarat, other, sites, associated, with, the, late, phase, of, the, harappan, culture, are, pirak, in, balochistan, pakistan, and, daimabad, in, maharashtra, india, the, largest, late, harappan, sites, are, kudwala, in, cholistan, in, punjab, bet, dwarka, in, gujarat, and, daimabad, in, maharashtra, which, can, be, considered, as, urban, but, they, are, smaller, and, few, in, number, compared, with, the, mature, harappan, cities, bet, dwarka, was, fortified, and, continued, to, have, contacts, with, the, persian, gulf, region, but, there, was, a, general, decrease, of, long, distance, trade, on, the, other, hand, the, period, also, saw, a, diversification, of, the, agricultural, base, with, a, diversity, of, crops, and, the, advent, of, double, cropping, as, well, as, a, shift, of, rural, settlement, towards, the, east, and, the, south, the, pottery, of, the, late, harappan, period, is, described, as, showing, some, continuity, with, mature, harappan, pottery, traditions, but, also, distinctive, differences, many, sites, continued, to, be, occupied, for, some, centuries, although, their, urban, features, declined, and, disappeared, formerly, typical, artifacts, such, as, stone, weights, and, female, figurines, became, rare, there, are, some, circular, stamp, seals, with, geometric, designs, but, lacking, the, indus, script, which, characterised, the, mature, phase, of, the, civilisation, script, is, rare, and, confined, to, potsherd, inscriptions, there, was, also, a, decline, in, long, distance, trade, although, the, local, cultures, show, new, innovations, in, faience, and, glass, making, and, carving, of, stone, beads, urban, amenities, such, as, drains, and, the, public, bath, were, no, longer, maintained, and, newer, buildings, were, poorly, constructed, stone, sculptures, were, deliberately, vandalised, valuables, were, sometimes, concealed, in, hoards, suggesting, unrest, and, the, corpses, of, animals, and, even, humans, were, left, unburied, in, the, streets, and, in, abandoned, buildings, during, the, later, half, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, most, of, the, post, urban, late, harappan, settlements, were, abandoned, altogether, subsequent, material, culture, was, typically, characterised, by, temporary, occupation, the, campsites, of, a, population, which, was, nomadic, and, mainly, pastoralist, and, which, used, crude, handmade, pottery, however, there, is, greater, continuity, and, overlap, between, late, harappan, and, subsequent, cultural, phases, at, sites, in, punjab, haryana, and, western, uttar, pradesh, primarily, small, rural, settlements, in, 1953, sir, mortimer, wheeler, proposed, that, the, invasion, of, an, indo, european, tribe, from, central, asia, the, aryans, caused, the, decline, of, the, indus, civilisation, as, evidence, he, cited, a, group, of, 37, skeletons, found, in, various, parts, of, mohenjo, daro, and, passages, in, the, vedas, referring, to, battles, and, forts, however, scholars, soon, started, to, reject, wheeler, s, theory, since, the, skeletons, belonged, to, a, period, after, the, city, s, abandonment, and, none, were, found, near, the, citadel, subsequent, examinations, of, the, skeletons, by, kenneth, kennedy, in, 1994, showed, that, the, marks, on, the, skulls, were, caused, by, erosion, and, not, by, violence, in, the, cemetery, h, culture, the, late, harappan, phase, in, the, punjab, region, some, of, the, designs, painted, on, the, funerary, urns, have, been, interpreted, through, the, lens, of, vedic, literature, for, instance, peacocks, with, hollow, bodies, and, a, small, human, form, inside, which, has, been, interpreted, as, the, souls, of, the, dead, and, a, hound, that, can, be, seen, as, the, hound, of, yama, the, god, of, death, this, may, indicate, the, introduction, of, new, religious, beliefs, during, this, period, but, the, archaeological, evidence, does, not, support, the, hypothesis, that, the, cemetery, h, people, were, the, destroyers, of, the, harappan, cities, suggested, contributory, causes, for, the, localisation, of, the, ivc, include, changes, in, the, course, of, the, river, and, climate, change, that, is, also, signaled, for, the, neighboring, areas, of, the, middle, east, as, of, 2016, many, scholars, believe, that, drought, and, a, decline, in, trade, with, egypt, and, mesopotamia, caused, the, collapse, of, the, indus, civilisation, the, climate, change, which, caused, the, collapse, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, was, possibly, due, to, an, abrupt, and, critical, mega, drought, and, cooling, 4, 200, years, ago, which, marks, the, onset, of, the, meghalayan, age, the, present, stage, of, the, holocene, the, ghaggar, hakra, system, was, rain, fed, and, water, supply, depended, on, the, monsoons, the, indus, valley, climate, grew, significantly, cooler, and, drier, from, about, 1800, bce, linked, to, a, general, weakening, of, the, monsoon, at, that, time, the, indian, monsoon, declined, and, aridity, increased, with, the, ghaggar, hakra, retracting, its, reach, towards, the, foothills, of, the, himalaya, leading, to, erratic, and, less, extensive, floods, that, made, inundation, agriculture, less, sustainable, aridification, reduced, the, water, supply, enough, to, cause, the, civilisation, s, demise, and, scatter, its, population, eastward, according, to, giosan, et, al, 2012, the, ivc, residents, did, not, develop, irrigation, capabilities, relying, mainly, on, the, seasonal, monsoons, leading, to, summer, floods, as, the, monsoons, kept, shifting, south, the, floods, grew, too, erratic, for, sustainable, agricultural, activities, the, residents, then, migrated, towards, the, ganges, basin, in, the, east, where, they, established, smaller, villages, and, isolated, farms, the, small, surplus, produced, in, these, small, communities, did, not, allow, the, development, of, trade, and, the, cities, died, out, archaeological, excavations, indicate, that, the, decline, of, harappa, drove, people, eastward, according, to, possehl, after, 1900, bce, the, number, of, sites, in, today, s, india, increased, from, 218, to, 853, according, to, andrew, lawler, excavations, along, the, gangetic, plain, show, that, cities, began, to, arise, there, starting, about, 1200, bce, just, a, few, centuries, after, harappa, was, deserted, and, much, earlier, than, once, suspected, according, to, jim, shaffer, there, was, a, continuous, series, of, cultural, developments, just, as, in, most, areas, of, the, world, these, link, the, so, called, two, major, phases, of, urbanisation, in, south, asia, at, sites, such, as, bhagwanpura, in, haryana, archaeological, excavations, have, discovered, an, overlap, between, the, final, phase, of, late, harappan, pottery, and, the, earliest, phase, of, painted, grey, ware, pottery, the, latter, being, associated, with, the, vedic, culture, and, dating, from, around, 1200, bce, this, site, provides, evidence, of, multiple, social, groups, occupying, the, same, village, but, using, different, pottery, and, living, in, different, types, of, houses, over, time, the, late, harappan, pottery, was, gradually, replaced, by, painted, grey, ware, pottery, and, other, cultural, changes, indicated, by, archaeology, include, the, introduction, of, the, horse, iron, tools, and, new, religious, practices, there, is, also, a, harappan, site, called, rojdi, in, rajkot, district, of, saurashtra, its, excavation, started, under, an, archaeological, team, from, gujarat, state, department, of, archaeology, and, the, museum, of, the, university, of, pennsylvania, in, 1982, 83, in, their, report, on, archaeological, excavations, at, rojdi, gregory, possehl, and, m, h, raval, write, that, although, there, are, obvious, signs, of, cultural, continuity, between, the, harappan, civilisation, and, later, south, asian, cultures, many, aspects, of, the, harappan, sociocultural, system, and, integrated, civilization, were, lost, forever, while, the, second, urbanisation, of, india, beginning, with, the, northern, black, polished, ware, culture, c, 600, bce, lies, well, outside, this, sociocultural, environment, previously, scholars, believed, that, the, decline, of, the, harappan, civilisation, led, to, an, interruption, of, urban, life, in, the, indian, subcontinent, however, the, indus, valley, civilisation, did, not, disappear, suddenly, and, many, elements, of, the, indus, civilisation, appear, in, later, cultures, the, cemetery, h, culture, may, be, the, manifestation, of, the, late, harappan, over, a, large, area, in, the, region, of, punjab, haryana, and, western, uttar, pradesh, and, the, ochre, coloured, pottery, culture, its, successor, david, gordon, white, cites, three, other, mainstream, scholars, who, have, emphatically, demonstrated, that, vedic, religion, derives, partially, from, the, indus, valley, civilisations, as, of, 2016, archaeological, data, suggests, that, the, material, culture, classified, as, late, harappan, may, have, persisted, until, at, least, c, 1000, 900, bce, and, was, partially, contemporaneous, with, the, painted, grey, ware, culture, harvard, archaeologist, richard, meadow, points, to, the, late, harappan, settlement, of, pirak, which, thrived, continuously, from, 1800, bce, to, the, time, of, the, invasion, of, alexander, the, great, in, 325, bce, in, the, aftermath, of, the, indus, civilisation, s, localisation, regional, cultures, emerged, to, varying, degrees, showing, the, influence, of, the, indus, civilisation, in, the, formerly, great, city, of, harappa, burials, have, been, found, that, correspond, to, a, regional, culture, called, the, cemetery, h, culture, at, the, same, time, the, ochre, coloured, pottery, culture, expanded, from, rajasthan, into, the, gangetic, plain, the, cemetery, h, culture, has, the, earliest, evidence, for, cremation, a, practice, dominant, in, hinduism, today, the, inhabitants, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, migrated, from, the, river, valleys, of, indus, and, ghaggar, hakra, towards, the, himalayan, foothills, of, the, ganga, yamuna, basin, in, 2019, a, study, of, the, genome, sequence, of, a, harappan, individual, from, a, cemetery, near, rakhigarhi, dating, to, around, 2, 800, 2, 300, bce, was, published, analysis, suggested, that, the, majority, of, the, genome, was, related, to, caucasus, hunter, gatherers, and, iranian, neolithic, farmers, the, remaining, portion, of, the, genome, was, from, a, south, asian, source, termed, ancient, ancestral, south, indians, that, is, distantly, related, to, the, andamanese, peoples, the, genome, completely, lacked, the, western, steppe, herder, related, ancestry, that, is, found, in, modern, particularly, in, northern, south, asians, the, genetic, profile, of, ivc, related, individuals, is, similar, to, the, majority, of, the, ancestry, found, in, modern, south, asians
