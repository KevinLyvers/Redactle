while, the, achaemenid, empire, was, the, first, conflicting, accounts, shroud, the, details, of, the, fall, of, the, parthian, empire, and, subsequent, rise, of, the, sassanian, empire, in, mystery, the, sassanian, empire, was, established, in, estakhr, by, ardashir, i, ardashir, s, father, papak, was, originally, the, ruler, of, a, region, called, khir, however, by, 200, papak, had, managed, to,

shapur, managed, to, expand, their, power, over, all, of, pars, subsequent, events, are, unclear, due, to, the, elusive, nature, of, the, sources, it, is, certain, that, following, the, death, of, papak, ardashir, the, governor, of, darabgerd, became, involved, in, a, power, struggle, with, his, elder, brother, shapur, sources, reveal, that, shapur, was, killed, when, the, roof, of, a,

his, territory, demanding, fealty, from, the, local, princes, of, fars, and, gaining, control, over, the, neighbouring, provinces, of, kerman, isfahan, susiana, and, mesene, this, expansion, quickly, came, to, the, attention, of, artabanus, iv, the, parthian, king, who, initially, ordered, the, governor, of, khuzestan, to, wage, war, against, ardashir, in, 224, but, ardashir, was, victorious, in, the, ensuing, battles, in, a, second, attempt, to, destroy, ardashir, artabanus, himself, met, ardashir, in, battle, at, hormozgan, where, the, former, met, his, death, following, the, death, of, the,

by, the, geography, of, the, province, of, fars, which, was, separated, from, the, rest, of, iran, crowned, in, 224, at, ctesiphon, as, the, sole, ruler, of, persia, ardashir, took, the, title,

in, the, west, where, persian, forces, won, a, series, of, battles, but, were, unable, to, make, territorial, gains, due, to, the, failure, of, repeated, sieges, of, the, key, frontier, city, of,

of, his, sons, became, a, christian, after, khosrow, i, hormizd, iv, 579, 590, took, the, throne, the, war, with, the, byzantines, continued, to, rage, intensely, but, inconclusively, until, the, general, bahram, chobin, dismissed, and, humiliated, by, hormizd, rose, in, revolt, in, 589, the, following, year, hormizd, was, overthrown, by, a, palace, coup, and, his, son, khosrow, ii, 590, 628, placed, on, the, throne, however, this, change, of, ruler, failed, to, placate, bahram, who, defeated, khosrow, forcing, him, to, flee, to, byzantine, territory, and, seized, the, throne, for, himself, as, bahram, vi, khosrow, asked, the, byzantine, emperor, maurice, 582, 602, for, assistance, against, bahram, offering, to, cede, the, western, caucasus, to, the, byzantines, to, cement, the, alliance, khosrow, also, married, maurice, s, daughter, miriam, under, the, command, of, khosrow, and, the, byzantine, generals, narses, and, john, mystacon, the, new, combined, byzantine, persian,

control, of, western, armenia, and, caucasian, iberia, the, new, peace, arrangement, allowed, the, two, empires, to, focus, on, military, matters, elsewhere, khosrow, focused, on, the, sassanid, empire, s, eastern, frontier, while, maurice, restored, byzantine, control, of, the, balkans, circa, 600, the, hephthalites, had, been, raiding, the, sassanid, empire, as, far, as, spahan, in, central, iran, the, hephthalites, issued, numerous, coins, imitating, the, coinage, of, khosrow, ii, in, c, 606, 607, khosrow, recalled, smbat, iv, bagratuni, from, persian, armenia, and, sent, him, to, iran, to, repel, the, hephthalites, smbat, with, the, aid, of, a, persian, prince, named, datoyean, repelled, the, hephthalites, from, persia, and, plundered, their, domains, in, eastern, khorasan, where, smbat, is, said, to, have, killed, their, king, in, single, combat, after, maurice, was, overthrown, and, killed, by, phocas, 602, 610, in, 602, however, khosrow, ii, used, the, murder, of, his, benefactor, as, a, pretext, to, begin, a, new, invasion, which, benefited, from, continuing, civil, war, in, the, byzantine, empire, and, met, little, effective, resistance, khosrow, s, generals, systematically, subdued, the, heavily, fortified, frontier, cities, of, byzantine, mesopotamia, and, armenia, laying, the, foundations, for, unprecedented, expansion, the, persians,

byzantine, emperor, heraclius, thereafter, the, persian, advance, continued, unchecked, jerusalem, fell, in, 614, alexandria, in, 619, and, the, rest, of, egypt, by, 621, the, sassanid, dream, of, restoring, the, achaemenid, boundaries, was, almost, complete, while, the, byzantine, empire, was, on, the, verge, of, collapse, this, remarkable, peak, of, expansion, was, paralleled, by, a, blossoming, of, persian, art, music, and, architecture, while, successful, at, its, first, stage, from, 602, to, 622, the, campaign, of, khosrau, ii, had, actually, exhausted, the, persian, army, and, treasuries, in, an, effort, to, rebuild, the, national, treasuries, khosrau, overtaxed, the, population, thus, while, his, empire, was, on, the, verge, of, total, defeat, heraclius, 610, 641, drew, on, all, his, diminished, and, devastated, empire, s, remaining, resources, reorganised, his, armies, and, mounted, a, remarkable, risky, counter, offensive, between, 622, and, 627, he, campaigned, against, the, persians, in, anatolia, and, the, caucasus, winning, a, string, of, victories, against, persian, forces, under, shahrbaraz, shahin, and, shahraplakan, whose, competition, to, claim, the, glory, of, personally, defeating, the, byzantine, emperor, contributed, to, their, failure, sacking, the, great, zoroastrian, temple, at, ganzak, and, securing, assistance, from, the, khazars, and, western, turkic, khaganate, in, response, khosrau, in, coordination, with, avar, and, slavic, forces, launched, a, siege, on, the, byzantine, capital, of, constantinople, in, 626, the, sassanids, led, by, shahrbaraz, attacked, the, city, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, bosphorus, while, his, avar, and, slavic, allies, invaded, from, the, western, side, attempts, to, ferry, the, persian, forces, across, the, bosphorus, to, aid, their, allies, the, slavic, forces, being, by, far, the, most, capable, in, siege, warfare, were, blocked, by, the, byzantine, fleet, and, the, siege, ended, in, failure, in, 627, 628, heraclius, mounted, a, winter, invasion, of, mesopotamia, and, despite, the, departure, of, his, khazar, allies, defeated, a, persian, army, commanded, by, rhahzadh, in, the, battle, of, nineveh, he, then, marched, down, the, tigris, devastating, the, country, and, sacking, khosrau, s, palace, at, dastagerd, he, was, prevented, from, attacking, ctesiphon, by, the, destruction, of, the, bridges, on, the, nahrawan, canal, and, conducted, further, raids, before, withdrawing, up, the, diyala, into, north, western, iran, the, impact, of, heraclius, s, victories, the, devastation, of, the, richest, territories, of, the, sassanid, empire, and, the, humiliating, destruction, of, high, profile, targets, such, as, ganzak, and, dastagerd, fatally, undermined, khosrau, s, prestige, and, his, support, among, the, persian, aristocracy, in, early, 628, he, was, overthrown, and, murdered, by, his, son, kavadh, ii, 628, who, immediately, brought, an, end, to, the, war, agreeing, to, withdraw, from, all, occupied, territories, in, 629, heraclius, restored, the, true, cross, to, jerusalem, in, a, majestic, ceremony, kavadh, died, within, months, and, chaos,

hands, of, the, generals, it, would, take, several, years, for, a, strong, king, to, emerge, from, a, series, of, coups, and, the, sassanids, never, had, time, to, recover, fully, in, early, 632, a, grandson, of, khosrau, i, who, had, lived, in, hiding, in, estakhr, yazdegerd, iii, acceded, to, the, throne, the, same, year, the, first, raiders, from, the, arab, tribes, newly, united, by, islam,

conquest, of, persia, the, sassanids, never, mounted, a, truly, effective, resistance, to, the, pressure, applied, by, the, initial, arab, armies, yazdegerd, was, a, boy, at, the, mercy, of, his, advisers, and, incapable, of, uniting, a, vast, country, crumbling, into, small, feudal, kingdoms, despite, the, fact, that, the, byzantines, under, similar, pressure, from, the, newly, expansive,

shortly, afterward, thus, the, muslims, were, able, to, seize, a, powerful, financial, resource, leaving, the, sassanid, government, strapped, for, funds, a, number, of, sassanid, governors, attempted, to, combine, their, forces, to, throw, back, the, invaders, but, the, effort, was, crippled, by, the, lack, of, a, strong, central, authority, and, the, governors, were, defeated, at, the,

regions, and, to, the, establishment, of, the, first, native, iranian, islamic, dynasty, the, samanid, dynasty, which, sought, to, revive, sassanid, traditions, the, abrupt, fall, of, the, sassanid, empire, was, completed, in, a, period, of, just, five, years, and, most, of, its, territory, was, absorbed, into, the, islamic, caliphate, however, many, iranian, cities, resisted, and, fought, against, the, invaders, several, times, islamic, caliphates, repeatedly, suppressed, revolts, in, cities, such, as, rey, isfahan, and, hamadan, the, local, population, was, initially, under, little,

kings, their, well, ordered, policy, their, care, for, their, subjects, and, the, prosperity, of, their, domains, in, normal, times, the, monarchical, office, was, hereditary, but, might, be,

from, subjected, territories, many, new, noble, families, had, risen, after, the, dissolution, of, the, parthian, dynasty, while, several, of, the, once, dominant, seven, parthian, clans, remained, of, high, importance, at, the, court, of, ardashir, i, the, old, arsacid, families, of, the, house, of, karen, and, the, house, of, suren, along, with, several, other, families, the, varazes, and,

originated, from, ardashir, i, the, first, shahanshah, of, the, empire, ardashir, restored, the, achaemenid, military, organizations, retained, the, parthian, cavalry, model, and, employed, new, types, of, armour, and, siege, warfare, techniques, the, relationship, between, priests, and, warriors, was, important, because, the, concept, of, r, nshahr, had, been, revived, by, the, priests, disagreements, between, the, priests, and, the, warriors, led, to, fragmentation, within, the, empire, which, led, to, its, downfall, the, paygan, formed, the, bulk, of, the, sassanid, infantry, and, were, often, recruited, from, the, peasant, population, each, unit, was, headed, by, an, officer, called, a, paygan, salar, which, meant, commander, of, the, infantry, and, their, main, task, was, to, guard, the, baggage, train, serve, as, pages, to, the, asvaran, a, higher, rank, storm, fortification, walls, undertake, entrenchment, projects, and, excavate, mines, those, serving, in, the, infantry, were, fitted, with, shields, and, lances, to, make, the, size, of, their, army, larger, the, sassanids, added, soldiers, provided, by, the, medes, and, the, dailamites, to, their, own, the, medes, provided, the, sassanid, army, with, high, quality, javelin, throwers, slingers, and, heavy, infantry, iranian, infantry, are, described, by, ammianus, marcellinus, as, armed, like, gladiators, and, obey, orders, like, so, many, horse, boys, the, dailamite, people, also, served, as, infantry, and, were, iranian, people, who, lived, mainly, within, gilan, iranian, azerbaijan, and, mazandaran, they, are, reported, as, having, fought, with, weapons, such, as, daggers, swords, and, javelins, and, reputed, to, have, been, recognized, by, romans, for, their, skills, and, hardiness, in, close, quarter, combat, one, account, of, dailamites, recounted, their, participation, in, an, invasion, of, yemen, where, 800, of, them, were, led, by, the, dailamite, officer, vahriz, vahriz, would, eventually, defeat, the, arab, forces, in, yemen, and, its, capital, sana, a, making, it, a, sasanian, vassal, until, the, invasion, of, persia, by, arabs, the, sasanian, navy, was, an, important, constituent, of, the, sasanian, military, from, the, time, that, ardashir, i, conquered, the, arab, side, of, the, persian, gulf, because, controlling, the, persian, gulf, was, an, economic, necessity, the, sasanian, navy, worked, to, keep, it, safe, from, piracy, prevent, roman, encroachment, and, keep, the, arab, tribes, from, getting, hostile, however, it, is, believed, by, many, historians, that, the, naval, force, could, not, have, been, a, strong, one, as, the, men, serving, in, the, navy, were, those, who, were, confined, in, prisons, the, leader, of, the, navy, bore, the, title, of, n, vbed, the, cavalry, used, during, the, sassanid, empire, were, two, types, of, heavy, cavalry, units, clibanarii, and, cataphracts, the, first, cavalry, force, composed, of, elite, noblemen, trained, since, youth, for, military, service, was, supported, by, light, cavalry, infantry, and, archers, mercenaries, and, tribal, people, of, the, empire, including, the, turks, kushans, sarmatians, khazars, georgians, and, armenians, were, included, in, these, first, cavalry, units, the, second, cavalry, involved, the, use, of, the, war, elephants, in, fact, it, was, their, specialty, to, deploy, elephants, as, cavalry, support, unlike, the, parthians, the, sassanids, developed, advanced, siege, engines, the, development, of, siege, weapons, was, a, useful, weapon, during, conflicts, with, rome, in, which, success, hinged, upon, the, ability, to, seize, cities, and, other, fortified, points, conversely, the, sassanids, also, developed, a, number, of, techniques, for, defending, their, own, cities, from, attack, the, sassanid, army, was, much, like, the, preceding, parthian, army, although, some, of, the, sassanid, s, heavy, cavalry, were, equipped, with, lances, while, parthian, armies, were, heavily, equipped, with, bows, the, roman, historian, ammianus, marcellinus, s, description, of, shapur, ii, s, clibanarii, cavalry, manifestly, shows, how, heavily, equipped, it, was, and, how, only, a, portion, were, spear, equipped, all, the, companies, were, clad, in, iron, and, all, parts, of, their, bodies, were, covered, with, thick, plates, so, fitted, that, the, stiff, joints, conformed, with, those, of, their, limbs, and, the, forms, of, human, faces, were, so, skillfully, fitted, to, their, heads, that, since, their, entire, body, was, covered, with, metal, arrows, that, fell, upon, them, could, lodge, only, where, they, could, see, a, little, through, tiny, openings, opposite, the, pupil, of, the, eye, or, where, through, the, tip, of, their, nose, they, were, able, to, get, a, little, breath, of, these, some, who, were, armed, with, pikes, stood, so, motionless, that, you, would, have, thought, them, held, fast, by, clamps, of, bronze, horsemen, in, the, sassanid, cavalry, lacked, a, stirrup, instead, they, used, a, war, saddle, which, had, a, cantle, at, the, back, and, two, guard, clamps, which, curved, across, the, top, of, the, rider, s, thighs, this, allowed, the, horsemen, to, stay, in, the, saddle, at, all, times, during, the, battle, especially, during, violent, encounters, the, byzantine, emperor, maurikios, also, emphasizes, in, his, strategikon, that, many, of, the, sassanid, heavy, cavalry, did, not, carry, spears, relying, on, their, bows, as, their, primary, weapons, conversely, the, taq, i, bustan, reliefs, and, al, tabari, s, famed, list, of, equipment, required, for, dihqan, knights, included, the, lance, the, amount, of, money, involved, in, maintaining, a, warrior, of, the, asawaran, azatan, knightly, caste, required, a, small, estate, and, the, asawaran, azatan, knightly, caste, received, that, from, the, throne, and, in, return, were, the, throne, s, most, notable, defenders, in, time, of, war, the, sassanids, like, the, parthians, were, in, constant, hostilities, with, the, roman, empire, the, sassanids, who, succeeded, the, parthians, were, recognized, as, one, of, the, leading, world, powers, alongside, its, neighboring, rival, the, byzantine, empire, or, eastern, roman, empire, for, a, period, of, more, than, 400, years, following, the, division, of, the, roman, empire, in, 395, the, byzantine, empire, with, its, capital, at, constantinople, continued, as, persia, s, principal, western, enemy, and, main, enemy, in, general, hostilities, between, the, two, empires, became, more, frequent, the, sassanids, similar, to, the, roman, empire, were, in, a, constant, state, of, conflict, with, neighboring, kingdoms, and, nomadic, hordes, although, the, threat, of, nomadic, incursions, could, never, be, fully, resolved, the, sassanids, generally, dealt, much, more, successfully, with, these, matters, than, did, the, romans, due, to, their, policy, of, making, coordinated, campaigns, against, threatening, nomads, the, last, of, the, many, and, frequent, wars, with, the, byzantines, the, climactic, byzantine, sasanian, war, of, 602, 628, which, included, the, siege, of, the, byzantine, capital, constantinople, ended, with, both, rivalling, sides, having, drastically, exhausted, their, human, and, material, resources, furthermore, social, conflict, within, the, empire, had, considerably, weakened, it, further, consequently, they, were, vulnerable, to, the, sudden, emergence, of, the, islamic, rashidun, caliphate, whose, forces, invaded, both, empires, only, a, few, years, after, the, war, the, muslim, forces, swiftly, conquered, the, entire, sasanian, empire, and, in, the, byzantine, arab, wars, deprived, the, byzantine, empire, of, its, territories, in, the, levant, the, caucasus, egypt, and, north, africa, over, the, following, centuries, half, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, entire, sasanian, empire, came, under, muslim, rule, in, general, over, the, span, of, the, centuries, in, the, west, sassanid, territory, abutted, that, of, the, large, and, stable, roman, state, but, to, the, east, its, nearest, neighbors, were, the, kushan, empire, and, nomadic, tribes, such, as, the, white, huns, the, construction, of, fortifications, such, as, tus, citadel, or, the, city, of, nishapur, which, later, became, a, center, of, learning, and, trade, also, assisted, in, defending, the, eastern, provinces, from, attack, in, south, and, central, arabia, bedouin, arab, tribes, occasionally, raided, the, sassanid, empire, the, kingdom, of, al, hirah, a, sassanid, vassal, kingdom, was, established, to, form, a, buffer, zone, between, the, empire, s, heartland, and, the, bedouin, tribes, the, dissolution, of, the, kingdom, of, al, hirah, by, khosrau, ii, in, 602, contributed, greatly, to, decisive, sassanid, defeats, suffered, against, bedouin, arabs, later, in, the, century, these, defeats, resulted, in, a, sudden, takeover, of, the, sassanid, empire, by, bedouin, tribes, under, the, islamic, banner, in, the, north, khazars, and, the, western, turkic, khaganate, frequently, assaulted, the, northern, provinces, of, the, empire, they, plundered, media, in, 634, shortly, thereafter, the, persian, army, defeated, them, and, drove, them, out, the, sassanids, built, numerous, fortifications, in, the, caucasus, region, to, halt, these, attacks, such, as, the, imposing, fortifications, built, in, derbent, dagestan, north, caucasus, now, a, part, of, russia, that, to, a, large, extent, have, remained, intact, up, to, this, day, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, caspian, sea, the, sassanians, erected, the, great, wall, of, gorgan, a, 200, km, long, defensive, structure, probably, aimed, to, protect, the, empire, from, northern, peoples, such, as, the, white, huns, in, 522, before, khosrau, s, reign, a, group, of, monophysite, axumites, led, an, attack, on, the, dominant, himyarites, of, southern, arabia, the, local, arab, leader, was, able, to, resist, the, attack, but, appealed, to, the, sassanians, for, aid, while, the, axumites, subsequently, turned, towards, the, byzantines, for, help, the, axumites, sent, another, force, across, the, red, sea, and, this, time, successfully, killed, the, arab, leader, and, replaced, him, with, an, axumite, man, to, be, king, of, the, region, in, 531, emperor, justinian, suggested, that, the, axumites, of, yemen, should, cut, out, the, persians, from, indian, trade, by, maritime, trade, with, the, indians, the, ethiopians, never, met, this, request, because, an, axumite, general, named, abraha, took, control, of, the, yemenite, throne, and, created, an, independent, nation, after, abraha, s, death, one, of, his, sons, ma, d, karib, went, into, exile, while, his, half, brother, took, the, throne, after, being, denied, by, justinian, ma, d, karib, sought, help, from, khosrau, who, sent, a, small, fleet, and, army, under, commander, vahriz, to, depose, the, new, king, of, yemen, after, capturing, the, capital, city, san, a, l, ma, d, karib, s, son, saif, was, put, on, the, throne, justinian, was, ultimately, responsible, for, sassanian, maritime, presence, in, yemen, by, not, providing, the, yemenite, arabs, support, khosrau, was, able, to, help, ma, d, karib, and, subsequently, established, yemen, as, a, principality, of, the, sassanian, empire, like, their, predecessors, the, parthians, the, sassanid, empire, carried, out, active, foreign, relations, with, china, and, ambassadors, from, persia, frequently, traveled, to, china, chinese, documents, report, on, sixteen, sassanid, embassies, to, china, from, 455, to, 555, commercially, land, and, sea, trade, with, china, was, important, to, both, the, sassanid, and, chinese, empires, large, numbers, of, sassanid, coins, have, been, found, in, southern, china, confirming, maritime, trade, on, different, occasions, sassanid, kings, sent, their, most, talented, persian, musicians, and, dancers, to, the, chinese, imperial, court, at, luoyang, during, the, jin, and, northern, wei, dynasties, and, to, chang, an, during, the, sui, and, tang, dynasties, both, empires, benefited, from, trade, along, the, silk, road, and, shared, a, common, interest, in, preserving, and, protecting, that, trade, they, cooperated, in, guarding, the, trade, routes, through, central, asia, and, both, built, outposts, in, border, areas, to, keep, caravans, safe, from, nomadic, tribes, and, bandits, politically, there, is, evidence, of, several, sassanid, and, chinese, efforts, in, forging, alliances, against, the, common, enemy, the, hephthalites, upon, the, rise, of, the, nomadic, g, kt, rks, in, inner, asia, there, is, also, what, looks, like, a, collaboration, between, china, and, the, sassanids, to, defuse, turkic, advances, documents, from, mt, mogh, talk, about, the, presence, of, a, chinese, general, in, the, service, of, the, king, of, sogdiana, at, the, time, of, the, arab, invasions, following, the, invasion, of, iran, by, muslim, arabs, peroz, iii, son, of, yazdegerd, iii, escaped, along, with, a, few, persian, nobles, and, took, refuge, in, the, chinese, imperial, court, both, peroz, and, his, son, narsieh, chinese, neh, shie, were, given, high, titles, at, the, chinese, court, on, at, least, two, occasions, the, last, possibly, in, 670, chinese, troops, were, sent, with, peroz, in, order, to, restore, him, to, the, sassanid, throne, narsieh, later, attained, the, position, of, a, commander, of, the, chinese, imperial, guards, and, his, descendants, lived, in, china, as, respected, princes, sassanian, refugees, fleeing, from, the, arab, conquest, to, settle, in, china, the, emperor, of, china, at, this, time, was, gaozong, of, tang, following, the, conquest, of, iran, and, neighboring, regions, shapur, i, extended, his, authority, northwest, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, previously, autonomous, kushans, were, obliged, to, accept, his, suzerainty, these, were, the, western, kushans, which, controlled, afghanistan, while, the, eastern, kushans, were, active, in, india, although, the, kushan, empire, declined, at, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, to, be, replaced, by, the, indian, gupta, empire, in, the, 4th, century, it, is, clear, that, the, sassanids, remained, relevant, in, india, s, northwest, throughout, this, period, persia, and, northwestern, india, the, latter, that, made, up, formerly, part, of, the, kushans, engaged, in, cultural, as, well, as, political, exchange, during, this, period, as, certain, sassanid, practices, spread, into, the, kushan, territories, in, particular, the, kushans, were, influenced, by, the, sassanid, conception, of, kingship, which, spread, through, the, trade, of, sassanid, silverware, and, textiles, depicting, emperors, hunting, or, dispensing, justice, this, cultural, interchange, did, not, however, spread, sassanid, religious, practices, or, attitudes, to, the, kushans, lower, level, cultural, interchanges, also, took, place, between, india, and, persia, during, this, period, for, example, persians, imported, the, early, form, of, chess, the, chaturanga, middle, persian, chatrang, from, india, in, exchange, persians, introduced, backgammon, n, w, arda, r, to, india, during, khosrau, i, s, reign, many, books, were, brought, from, india, and, translated, into, middle, persian, some, of, these, later, found, their, way, into, the, literature, of, the, islamic, world, and, arabic, literature, a, notable, example, of, this, was, the, translation, of, the, indian, panchatantra, by, one, of, khosrau, s, ministers, borzuya, this, translation, known, as, the, kal, lag, ud, dimnag, later, made, its, way, into, the, arabic, literature, and, europe, the, details, of, burzoe, s, legendary, journey, to, india, and, his, daring, acquisition, of, the, panchatantra, are, written, in, full, detail, in, ferdowsi, s, shahnameh, which, says, in, indian, books, borzuya, read, that, on, a, mountain, in, that, land, there, grows, a, plant, which, when, sprinkled, over, the, dead, revives, them, borzuya, asked, khosrau, i, for, permission, to, travel, to, india, to, obtain, the, plant, after, a, fruitless, search, he, was, led, to, an, ascetic, who, revealed, the, secret, of, the, plant, to, him, the, plant, was, word, the, mountain, learning, and, the, dead, the, ignorant, he, told, borzuya, of, a, book, the, remedy, of, ignorance, called, the, kalila, which, was, kept, in, a, treasure, chamber, the, king, of, india, gave, borzuya, permission, to, read, the, kalila, provided, that, he, did, not, make, a, copy, of, it, borzuya, accepted, the, condition, but, each, day, memorized, a, chapter, of, the, book, when, he, returned, to, his, room, he, would, record, what, he, had, memorized, that, day, thus, creating, a, copy, of, the, book, which, he, sent, to, iran, in, iran, bozorgmehr, translated, the, book, into, pahlavi, and, at, borzuya, s, request, named, the, first, chapter, after, him, in, contrast, to, parthian, society, the, sassanids, renewed, emphasis, on, a, charismatic, and, centralized, government, in, sassanid, theory, the, ideal, society, could, maintain, stability, and, justice, and, the, necessary, instrument, for, this, was, a, strong, monarch, thus, the, sasanians, aimed, to, be, an, urban, empire, at, which, they, were, quite, successful, during, the, late, sasanian, period, mesopotamia, had, the, largest, population, density, in, the, medieval, world, this, can, be, credited, to, among, other, things, the, sasanians, founding, and, re, founding, a, number, of, cities, which, is, talked, about, in, the, surviving, middle, persian, text, ahrest, n, h, r, n, ahr, the, provincial, capitals, of, iran, ardashir, i, himself, built, and, re, built, many, cities, which, he, named, after, himself, such, as, veh, ardashir, in, asoristan, ardashir, khwarrah, in, pars, and, vahman, ardashir, in, meshan, during, the, sasanian, period, many, cities, with, the, name, iran, khwarrah, were, established, this, was, because, sasanians, wanted, to, revive, avesta, ideology, many, of, these, cities, both, new, and, old, were, populated, not, only, by, native, ethnic, groups, such, as, the, iranians, or, syriacs, but, also, by, the, deported, roman, prisoners, of, war, such, as, goths, slavs, latins, and, others, many, of, these, prisoners, were, experienced, workers, who, were, used, to, build, things, such, as, cities, bridges, and, dams, this, allowed, the, sasanians, to, become, familiar, with, roman, technology, the, impact, these, foreigners, made, on, the, economy, was, significant, as, many, of, them, were, christians, and, the, spread, of, the, religion, accelerated, throughout, the, empire, unlike, the, amount, of, information, about, the, settled, people, of, the, sasanian, empire, there, is, little, about, the, nomadic, unsettled, ones, it, is, known, that, they, were, called, kurds, by, the, sasanians, and, that, they, regularly, served, the, sasanian, military, particularly, the, dailamite, and, gilani, nomads, this, way, of, handling, the, nomads, continued, into, the, islamic, period, where, the, service, of, the, dailamites, and, gilanis, continued, unabated, the, head, of, the, sasanian, empire, was, the, shahanshah, king, of, kings, also, simply, known, as, the, shah, king, his, health, and, welfare, was, of, high, importance, accordingly, the, phrase, may, you, be, immortal, was, used, to, reply, to, him, the, sasanian, coins, which, appeared, from, the, 6th, century, and, afterwards, depict, a, moon, and, sun, which, in, the, words, of, the, iranian, historian, touraj, daryaee, suggest, that, the, king, was, at, the, center, of, the, world, and, the, sun, and, moon, revolved, around, him, in, effect, he, was, the, king, of, the, four, corners, of, the, world, which, was, an, old, mesopotamian, idea, the, king, saw, all, other, rulers, such, as, the, romans, turks, and, chinese, as, being, beneath, him, the, king, wore, colorful, clothes, makeup, a, heavy, crown, while, his, beard, was, decorated, with, gold, the, early, sasanian, kings, considered, themselves, of, divine, descent, they, called, themselves, bay, divine, when, the, king, went, out, in, public, he, was, hidden, behind, a, curtain, and, had, some, of, his, men, in, front, of, him, whose, duty, was, to, keep, the, masses, away, from, him, and, to, clear, the, way, when, one, came, to, the, king, one, was, expected, to, prostrate, oneself, before, him, also, known, as, proskynesis, the, king, s, guards, were, known, as, the, pushtigban, on, other, occasions, the, king, was, protected, by, a, discrete, group, of, palace, guards, known, as, the, darigan, both, of, these, groups, were, enlisted, from, royal, families, of, the, sasanian, empire, and, were, under, the, command, of, the, hazarbed, who, was, in, charge, of, the, king, s, safety, controlled, the, entrance, of, the, kings, palace, presented, visitors, to, the, king, and, was, allowed, military, commands, or, used, as, a, negotiator, the, hazarbed, was, also, allowed, in, some, cases, to, serve, as, the, royal, executioner, during, nowruz, iranian, new, year, and, mihragan, mihr, s, day, the, king, would, hold, a, speech, sassanid, society, was, immensely, complex, with, separate, systems, of, social, organization, governing, numerous, different, groups, within, the, empire, historians, believe, society, comprised, four, social, classes, at, the, center, of, the, sasanian, caste, system, the, shahanshah, ruled, over, all, the, nobles, the, royal, princes, petty, rulers, great, landlords, and, priests, together, constituted, a, privileged, stratum, and, were, identified, as, wuzurgan, or, grandees, this, social, system, appears, to, have, been, fairly, rigid, the, sasanian, caste, system, outlived, the, empire, continuing, in, the, early, islamic, period, in, general, mass, slavery, was, never, practiced, by, the, iranians, and, in, many, cases, the, situation, and, lives, of, semi, slaves, prisoners, of, war, were, in, fact, better, than, those, of, the, commoner, in, persia, the, term, slave, was, also, used, for, debtors, who, had, to, use, some, of, their, time, to, serve, in, a, fire, temple, some, of, the, laws, governing, the, ownership, and, treatment, of, slaves, can, be, found, in, the, legal, compilation, called, the, matigan, i, hazar, datistan, a, collection, of, rulings, by, sasanian, judges, principles, that, can, be, inferred, from, the, laws, include, to, free, a, slave, irrespective, of, his, or, her, faith, was, considered, a, good, deed, slaves, had, some, rights, including, keeping, gifts, from, the, owner, and, at, least, three, days, of, rest, in, the, month, the, most, common, slaves, in, the, sasanian, empire, were, the, household, servants, who, worked, in, private, estates, and, at, the, fire, temples, usage, of, a, woman, slave, in, a, home, was, common, and, her, master, had, outright, control, over, her, and, could, even, produce, children, with, her, if, he, wanted, to, slaves, also, received, wages, and, were, able, to, have, their, own, families, whether, they, were, female, or, male, harming, a, slave, was, considered, a, crime, and, not, even, the, king, himself, was, allowed, to, do, it, the, master, of, a, slave, was, allowed, to, free, the, person, when, he, wanted, to, which, no, matter, what, faith, the, slave, believed, in, was, considered, a, good, deed, a, slave, could, also, be, freed, if, his, her, master, died, there, was, a, major, school, called, the, grand, school, in, the, capital, in, the, beginning, only, 50, students, were, allowed, to, study, at, the, grand, school, in, less, than, 100, years, enrollment, at, the, grand, school, was, over, 30, 000, students, on, a, lower, level, sasanian, society, was, divided, into, azatan, freemen, the, azatan, formed, a, large, low, aristocracy, of, low, level, administrators, mostly, living, on, small, estates, the, azatan, provided, the, cavalry, backbone, of, the, sasanian, army, the, sasanian, kings, were, patrons, of, letters, and, philosophy, khosrau, i, had, the, works, of, plato, and, aristotle, translated, into, pahlavi, taught, at, gundishapur, and, read, them, himself, during, his, reign, many, historical, annals, were, compiled, of, which, the, sole, survivor, is, the, karnamak, i, artaxshir, i, papakan, deeds, of, ardashir, a, mixture, of, history, and, romance, that, served, as, the, basis, of, the, iranian, national, epic, the, shahnameh, when, justinian, i, closed, the, schools, of, athens, seven, of, their, professors, went, to, persia, and, found, refuge, at, khosrau, s, court, in, his, treaty, of, 533, with, justinian, the, sasanian, king, stipulated, that, the, greek, sages, should, be, allowed, to, return, and, be, free, from, persecution, under, khosrau, i, the, academy, of, gundishapur, which, had, been, founded, in, the, 5th, century, became, the, greatest, intellectual, center, of, the, time, drawing, students, and, teachers, from, every, quarter, of, the, known, world, nestorian, christians, were, received, there, and, brought, syriac, translations, of, greek, works, in, medicine, and, philosophy, the, medical, lore, of, india, persia, syria, and, greece, mingled, there, to, produce, a, flourishing, school, of, therapy, artistically, the, sasanian, period, witnessed, some, of, the, highest, achievements, of, iranian, civilization, much, of, what, later, became, known, as, muslim, culture, including, architecture, and, writing, was, originally, drawn, from, persian, culture, at, its, peak, the, sasanian, empire, stretched, from, western, anatolia, to, northwest, india, today, pakistan, but, its, influence, was, felt, far, beyond, these, political, boundaries, sasanian, motifs, found, their, way, into, the, art, of, central, asia, and, china, the, byzantine, empire, and, even, merovingian, france, islamic, art, however, was, the, true, heir, to, sasanian, art, whose, concepts, it, was, to, assimilate, while, at, the, same, time, instilling, fresh, life, and, renewed, vigor, into, it, according, to, will, durant, sasanian, art, exported, its, forms, and, motifs, eastward, into, india, turkestan, and, china, westward, into, syria, asia, minor, constantinople, the, balkans, egypt, and, spain, probably, its, influence, helped, to, change, the, emphasis, in, greek, art, from, classic, representation, to, byzantine, ornament, and, in, latin, christian, art, from, wooden, ceilings, to, brick, or, stone, vaults, and, domes, and, buttressed, walls, sasanian, carvings, at, taq, e, bostan, and, naqsh, e, rustam, were, colored, so, were, many, features, of, the, palaces, but, only, traces, of, such, painting, remain, the, literature, however, makes, it, clear, that, the, art, of, painting, flourished, in, sasanian, times, painting, sculpture, pottery, and, other, forms, of, decoration, shared, their, designs, with, sasanian, textile, art, silks, embroideries, brocades, damasks, tapestries, chair, covers, canopies, tents, and, rugs, were, woven, with, patience, and, masterly, skill, and, were, dyed, in, warm, tints, of, yellow, blue, and, green, great, colorful, carpets, had, been, an, appendage, of, wealth, in, the, east, since, assyrian, days, the, two, dozen, sasanian, textiles, that, have, survived, are, among, the, most, highly, valued, fabrics, in, existence, even, in, their, own, day, sasanian, textiles, were, admired, and, imitated, from, egypt, to, the, far, east, and, during, the, middle, ages, they, were, favored, for, clothing, the, relics, of, christian, saints, studies, on, sasanian, remains, show, over, 100, types, of, crowns, being, worn, by, sasanian, kings, the, various, sasanian, crowns, demonstrate, the, cultural, economic, social, and, historical, situation, in, each, period, the, crowns, also, show, the, character, traits, of, each, king, in, this, era, different, symbols, and, signs, on, the, crowns, the, moon, stars, eagle, and, palm, each, illustrate, the, wearer, s, religious, faith, and, beliefs, the, sasanian, dynasty, like, the, achaemenid, originated, in, the, province, of, pars, the, sasanians, saw, themselves, as, successors, of, the, achaemenids, after, the, hellenistic, and, parthian, interlude, and, believed, that, it, was, their, destiny, to, restore, the, greatness, of, persia, in, reviving, the, glories, of, the, achaemenid, past, the, sasanians, were, no, mere, imitators, the, art, of, this, period, reveals, an, astonishing, virility, in, certain, respects, anticipating, key, features, of, islamic, art, sasanian, art, combined, elements, of, traditional, persian, art, with, hellenistic, elements, and, influences, the, conquest, of, persia, by, alexander, the, great, had, inaugurated, the, spread, of, hellenistic, art, into, western, asia, though, the, east, accepted, the, outward, form, of, this, art, it, never, really, assimilated, its, spirit, already, in, the, parthian, period, hellenistic, art, was, being, interpreted, freely, by, the, peoples, of, the, near, east, throughout, the, sasanian, period, there, was, reaction, against, it, sasanian, art, revived, forms, and, traditions, native, to, persia, and, in, the, islamic, period, these, reached, the, shores, of, the, mediterranean, according, to, fergusson, with, the, accession, of, the, persia, regained, much, of, that, power, and, stability, to, which, she, had, been, so, long, a, stranger, the, improvement, in, the, fine, arts, at, home, indicates, returning, prosperity, and, a, degree, of, security, unknown, since, the, fall, of, the, achaemenidae, surviving, palaces, illustrate, the, splendor, in, which, the, sasanian, monarchs, lived, examples, include, palaces, at, firuzabad, and, bishapur, in, fars, and, the, capital, city, of, ctesiphon, in, the, asoristan, province, present, day, iraq, in, addition, to, local, traditions, parthian, architecture, influenced, sasanian, architectural, characteristics, all, are, characterized, by, the, barrel, vaulted, iwans, introduced, in, the, parthian, period, during, the, sasanian, period, these, reached, massive, proportions, particularly, at, ctesiphon, there, the, arch, of, the, great, vaulted, hall, attributed, to, the, reign, of, shapur, i, 241, 272, has, a, span, of, more, than, 80, feet, 24, m, and, reaches, a, height, of, 118, feet, 36, m, this, magnificent, structure, fascinated, architects, in, the, centuries, that, followed, and, has, been, considered, one, of, the, most, important, examples, of, persian, architecture, many, of, the, palaces, contain, an, inner, audience, hall, consisting, as, at, firuzabad, of, a, chamber, surmounted, by, a, dome, the, persians, solved, the, problem, of, constructing, a, circular, dome, on, a, square, building, by, employing, squinches, or, arches, built, across, each, corner, of, the, square, thereby, converting, it, into, an, octagon, on, which, it, is, simple, to, place, the, dome, the, dome, chamber, in, the, palace, of, firuzabad, is, the, earliest, surviving, example, of, the, use, of, the, squinch, suggesting, that, this, architectural, technique, was, probably, invented, in, persia, the, unique, characteristic, of, sasanian, architecture, was, its, distinctive, use, of, space, the, sasanian, architect, conceived, his, building, in, terms, of, masses, and, surfaces, hence, the, use, of, massive, walls, of, brick, decorated, with, molded, or, carved, stucco, stucco, wall, decorations, appear, at, bishapur, but, better, examples, are, preserved, from, chal, tarkhan, near, rey, late, sasanian, or, early, islamic, in, date, and, from, ctesiphon, and, kish, in, mesopotamia, the, panels, show, animal, figures, set, in, roundels, human, busts, and, geometric, and, floral, motifs, due, to, the, majority, of, the, inhabitants, being, of, peasant, stock, the, sasanian, economy, relied, on, farming, and, agriculture, khuzestan, and, iraq, being, the, most, important, provinces, for, it, the, nahravan, canal, is, one, of, the, greatest, examples, of, sasanian, irrigation, systems, and, many, of, these, things, can, still, be, found, in, iran, the, mountains, of, the, sasanian, state, were, used, for, lumbering, by, the, nomads, of, the, region, and, the, centralized, nature, of, the, sasanian, state, allowed, it, to, impose, taxes, on, the, nomads, and, inhabitants, of, the, mountains, during, the, reign, of, khosrau, i, further, land, was, brought, under, centralized, administration, two, trade, routes, were, used, during, the, sasanian, period, one, in, the, north, the, famous, silk, route, and, one, less, prominent, route, on, the, southern, sasanian, coast, the, factories, of, susa, gundeshapur, and, shushtar, were, famously, known, for, their, production, of, silk, and, rivaled, the, chinese, factories, the, sasanians, showed, great, toleration, to, the, inhabitants, of, the, countryside, which, allowed, the, latter, to, stockpile, in, case, of, famine, persian, industry, under, the, sasanians, developed, from, domestic, to, urban, forms, guilds, were, numerous, good, roads, and, bridges, well, patrolled, enabled, state, post, and, merchant, caravans, to, link, ctesiphon, with, all, provinces, and, harbors, were, built, in, the, persian, gulf, to, quicken, trade, with, india, sasanian, merchants, ranged, far, and, wide, and, gradually, ousted, romans, from, the, lucrative, indian, ocean, trade, routes, recent, archeological, discovery, has, shown, the, interesting, fact, that, sasanians, used, special, labels, commercial, labels, on, goods, as, a, way, of, promoting, their, brands, and, distinguish, between, different, qualities, khosrau, i, further, extended, the, already, vast, trade, network, the, sasanian, state, now, tended, toward, monopolistic, control, of, trade, with, luxury, goods, assuming, a, far, greater, role, in, the, trade, than, heretofore, and, the, great, activity, in, building, of, ports, caravanserais, bridges, and, the, like, was, linked, to, trade, and, urbanization, the, persians, dominated, international, trade, both, in, the, indian, ocean, central, asia, and, south, russia, in, the, time, of, khosrau, although, competition, with, the, byzantines, was, at, times, intense, sassanian, settlements, in, oman, and, yemen, testify, to, the, importance, of, trade, with, india, but, the, silk, trade, with, china, was, mainly, in, the, hands, of, sasanian, vassals, and, the, iranian, people, the, sogdians, the, main, exports, of, the, sasanians, were, silk, woolen, and, golden, textiles, carpets, and, rugs, hides, and, leather, and, pearls, from, the, persian, gulf, there, were, also, goods, in, transit, from, china, paper, silk, and, india, spices, which, sasanian, customs, imposed, taxes, upon, and, which, were, re, exported, from, the, empire, to, europe, it, was, also, a, time, of, increased, metallurgical, production, so, iran, earned, a, reputation, as, the, armory, of, asia, most, of, the, sasanian, mining, centers, were, at, the, fringes, of, the, empire, in, armenia, the, caucasus, and, above, all, transoxania, the, extraordinary, mineral, wealth, of, the, pamir, mountains, led, to, a, legend, among, the, tajiks, when, god, was, creating, the, world, he, tripped, over, the, pamirs, dropping, his, jar, of, minerals, which, spread, across, the, region, under, parthian, rule, zoroastrianism, had, fragmented, into, regional, variations, which, also, saw, the, rise, of, local, cult, deities, some, from, iranian, religious, tradition, but, others, drawn, from, greek, tradition, too, greek, paganism, and, religious, ideas, had, spread, and, mixed, with, zoroastrianism, when, alexander, the, great, had, conquered, the, persian, empire, from, darius, iii, a, process, of, greco, persian, religious, and, cultural, synthesisation, which, had, continued, into, the, parthian, era, however, under, the, sassanids, an, orthodox, zoroastrianism, was, revived, and, the, religion, would, undergo, numerous, and, important, developments, sassanid, zoroastrianism, developed, clear, distinctions, from, the, practices, laid, out, in, the, avesta, the, holy, books, of, zoroastrianism, sassanid, religious, policies, contributed, to, the, flourishing, of, numerous, religious, reform, movements, most, importantly, those, founded, by, the, religious, leaders, mani, and, mazdak, the, relationship, between, the, sassanid, kings, and, the, religions, practiced, in, their, empire, became, complex, and, varied, for, instance, while, shapur, i, tolerated, and, encouraged, a, variety, of, religions, and, seems, to, have, been, a, zurvanite, himself, religious, minorities, at, times, were, suppressed, under, later, kings, such, as, bahram, ii, shapur, ii, on, the, other, hand, tolerated, religious, groups, except, christians, whom, he, only, persecuted, in, the, wake, of, constantine, s, conversion, from, the, very, beginning, of, sassanid, rule, in, 224, an, orthodox, pars, oriented, zoroastrian, tradition, would, play, an, important, part, in, influencing, and, lending, legitimization, to, the, state, until, its, collapse, in, the, mid, 7th, century, after, ardashir, i, had, deposed, the, last, parthian, king, artabanus, iv, he, sought, the, aid, of, tansar, a, herbad, high, priest, of, the, iranian, zoroastrians, to, aid, him, in, acquiring, legitimization, for, the, new, dynasty, this, tansar, did, by, writing, to, the, nominal, and, vassal, kings, in, different, regions, of, iran, to, accept, ardashir, i, as, their, new, king, most, notably, in, the, letter, of, tansar, which, was, addressed, to, gushnasp, the, vassal, king, of, tabarestan, gushnasp, had, accused, ardashir, i, of, having, forsaken, tradition, by, usurping, the, throne, and, that, while, his, actions, may, have, been, good, for, the, world, they, were, bad, for, the, faith, tansar, refuted, these, charges, in, his, letter, to, gushnasp, by, proclaiming, that, not, all, of, the, old, ways, had, been, good, and, that, ardashir, was, more, virtuous, than, his, predecessors, the, letter, of, tansar, included, some, attacks, on, the, religious, practices, and, orientation, of, the, parthians, who, did, not, follow, an, orthodox, zoroastrian, tradition, but, rather, a, heterodox, one, and, so, attempted, to, justify, ardashir, s, rebellion, against, them, by, arguing, that, zoroastrianism, had, decayed, after, alexander, s, invasion, a, decay, which, had, continued, under, the, parthians, and, so, needed, to, be, restored, tansar, would, later, help, to, oversee, the, formation, of, a, single, zoroastrian, church, under, the, control, of, the, persian, magi, alongside, the, establishment, of, a, single, set, of, avestan, texts, which, he, himself, approved, and, authorised, kartir, a, very, powerful, and, influential, persian, cleric, served, under, several, sassanid, kings, and, actively, campaigned, for, the, establishment, of, a, pars, centred, zoroastrian, orthodoxy, across, the, sassanid, empire, his, power, and, influence, grew, so, much, that, he, became, the, only, commoner, to, later, be, allowed, to, have, his, own, rock, inscriptions, carved, in, the, royal, fashion, at, sar, mashhad, naqsh, e, rostam, ka, ba, ye, zartosht, and, naqsh, e, rajab, under, shapur, i, kartir, was, made, the, absolute, authority, over, the, order, of, priests, at, the, sassanid, court, and, throughout, the, empire, s, regions, too, with, the, implication, that, all, regional, zoroastrian, clergies, would, now, for, the, first, time, be, subordinated, to, the, persian, zoroastrian, clerics, of, pars, to, some, extent, kartir, was, an, iconoclast, and, took, it, upon, himself, to, help, establish, numerous, bahram, fires, throughout, iran, in, the, place, of, the, bagins, ayazans, monuments, and, temples, containing, images, and, idols, of, cult, deities, that, had, proliferated, during, the, parthian, era, in, expressing, his, doctrinal, orthodoxy, kartir, also, encouraged, an, obscure, zoroastrian, concept, known, as, khvedodah, among, the, common, folk, marriage, within, the, family, between, siblings, cousins, at, various, stages, during, his, long, career, at, court, kartir, also, oversaw, the, periodic, persecution, of, the, non, zoroastrians, in, iran, and, secured, the, execution, of, the, prophet, mani, during, the, reign, of, bahram, i, during, the, reign, of, hormizd, i, the, predecessor, and, brother, of, bahram, i, kartir, was, awarded, the, new, zoroastrian, title, of, mobad, a, clerical, title, that, was, to, be, considered, higher, than, that, of, the, eastern, iranian, parthian, title, of, herbad, the, persians, had, long, known, of, the, egyptian, calendar, with, its, 365, days, divided, into, 12, months, however, the, traditional, zoroastrian, calendar, had, 12, months, of, 30, days, each, during, the, reign, of, ardashir, i, an, effort, was, made, to, introduce, a, more, accurate, zoroastrian, calendar, for, the, year, so, 5, extra, days, were, added, to, it, these, 5, extra, days, were, named, the, gatha, days, and, had, a, practical, as, well, as, religious, use, however, they, were, still, kept, apart, from, the, religious, year, so, as, not, to, disturb, the, long, held, observances, of, the, older, zoroastrian, calendar, some, difficulties, arose, with, the, introduction, of, the, first, calendar, reform, particularly, the, pushing, forward, of, important, zoroastrian, festivals, such, as, hamaspat, maedaya, and, nowruz, on, the, calendar, year, by, year, this, confusion, apparently, caused, much, distress, among, ordinary, people, and, while, the, sassanids, tried, to, enforce, the, observance, of, these, great, celebrations, on, the, new, official, dates, much, of, the, populace, continued, to, observe, them, on, the, older, traditional, dates, and, so, parallel, celebrations, for, nowruz, and, other, zoroastrian, celebrations, would, often, occur, within, days, of, each, other, in, defiance, of, the, new, official, calendar, dates, causing, much, confusion, and, friction, between, the, laity, and, the, ruling, class, a, compromise, on, this, by, the, sassanids, was, later, introduced, by, linking, the, parallel, celebrations, as, a, 6, day, celebration, feast, this, was, done, for, all, except, nowruz, a, further, problem, occurred, as, nowruz, had, shifted, in, position, during, this, period, from, the, spring, equinox, to, autumn, although, this, inconsistency, with, the, original, spring, equinox, date, for, nowruz, had, possibly, occurred, during, the, parthian, period, too, further, calendar, reforms, occurred, during, the, later, sassanid, era, ever, since, the, reforms, under, ardashir, i, there, had, been, no, intercalation, thus, with, a, quarter, day, being, lost, each, year, the, zoroastrian, holy, year, had, slowly, slipped, backwards, with, nowruz, eventually, ending, up, in, july, a, great, council, was, therefore, convened, and, it, was, decided, that, nowruz, be, moved, back, to, the, original, position, it, had, during, the, achaemenid, period, back, to, spring, this, change, probably, took, place, during, the, reign, of, kavad, i, in, the, early, 6th, century, much, emphasis, seems, to, have, been, placed, during, this, period, on, the, importance, of, spring, and, on, its, connection, with, the, resurrection, and, frashegerd, reflecting, the, regional, rivalry, and, bias, the, sassanids, are, believed, to, have, held, against, their, parthian, predecessors, it, was, probably, during, the, sassanid, era, that, the, two, great, fires, in, pars, and, media, the, adur, farnbag, and, adur, gushnasp, respectively, were, promoted, to, rival, and, even, eclipse, the, sacred, fire, in, parthia, the, adur, burzen, mehr, the, adur, burzen, mehr, linked, in, legend, with, zoroaster, and, vishtaspa, the, first, zoroastrian, king, was, too, holy, for, the, persian, magi, to, end, veneration, of, it, completely, it, was, therefore, during, the, sassanid, era, that, the, three, great, fires, of, the, zoroastrian, world, were, given, specific, associations, the, adur, farnbag, in, pars, became, associated, with, the, magi, adur, gushnasp, in, media, with, warriors, and, adur, burzen, mehr, in, parthia, with, the, lowest, estate, farmers, and, herdsmen, the, adur, gushnasp, eventually, became, by, custom, a, place, of, pilgrimage, by, foot, for, newly, enthroned, kings, after, their, coronation, it, is, likely, that, during, the, sassanid, era, these, three, great, fires, became, central, places, for, pilgrimage, among, zoroastrians, the, early, sassanids, ruled, against, the, use, of, cult, images, in, worship, and, so, statues, and, idols, were, removed, from, many, temples, and, where, possible, sacred, fires, were, installed, instead, this, policy, extended, even, to, the, non, iran, regions, of, the, empire, during, some, periods, hormizd, i, allegedly, destroyed, statues, erected, for, the, dead, in, armenia, however, only, cult, statues, were, removed, the, sassanids, continued, to, use, images, to, represent, the, deities, of, zoroastrianism, including, that, of, ahura, mazda, in, the, tradition, that, was, established, during, the, seleucid, era, in, the, early, sassanid, period, royal, inscriptions, often, consisted, of, parthian, middle, persian, and, greek, however, the, last, time, parthian, was, used, for, a, royal, inscription, came, during, the, reign, of, narseh, son, of, shapur, i, it, is, likely, therefore, that, soon, after, this, the, sassanids, made, the, decision, to, impose, persian, as, the, sole, official, language, within, iran, and, forbade, the, use, of, written, parthian, this, had, important, consequences, for, zoroastrianism, given, that, all, secondary, literature, including, the, zand, was, then, recorded, only, in, middle, persian, having, a, profound, impact, in, orienting, zoroastrianism, towards, the, influence, of, the, pars, region, the, homeland, of, the, sassanids, some, scholars, of, zoroastrianism, such, as, mary, boyce, have, speculated, that, it, is, possible, that, the, yasna, service, was, lengthened, during, the, sassanid, era, to, increase, its, impressiveness, this, appears, to, have, been, done, by, joining, the, gathic, staota, yesnya, with, the, haoma, ceremony, furthermore, it, is, believed, that, another, longer, service, developed, known, as, the, visperad, which, derived, from, the, extended, yasna, this, was, developed, for, the, celebration, of, the, seven, holy, days, of, obligation, the, gahambars, plus, nowruz, and, was, dedicated, to, ahura, mazda, while, the, very, earliest, zoroastrians, eschewed, writing, as, a, form, of, demonic, practice, the, middle, persian, zand, along, with, much, secondary, zoroastrian, literature, was, recorded, in, writing, during, the, sassanid, era, for, the, first, time, many, of, these, zoroastrian, texts, were, original, works, from, the, sassanid, period, perhaps, the, most, important, of, these, works, was, the, bundahishn, the, mythical, zoroastrian, story, of, creation, other, older, works, some, from, remote, antiquity, were, possibly, translated, from, different, iranian, languages, into, middle, persian, during, this, period, for, example, two, works, the, drakht, i, asurig, assyrian, tree, and, ayadgar, i, zareran, exploits, of, zarter, were, probably, translated, from, parthian, originals, of, great, importance, for, zoroastrianism, was, the, creation, of, the, avestan, alphabet, by, the, sassanids, which, enabled, the, accurate, rendering, of, the, avesta, in, written, form, including, in, its, original, language, phonology, for, the, first, time, the, alphabet, was, based, on, the, pahlavi, one, but, rather, than, the, inadequacy, of, that, script, for, recording, spoken, middle, persian, the, avestan, alphabet, had, 46, letters, and, was, well, suited, to, recording, avestan, in, written, form, in, the, way, the, language, actually, sounded, and, was, uttered, the, persian, magi, were, therefore, finally, able, to, record, all, surviving, ancient, avestan, texts, in, written, form, as, a, result, of, this, development, the, sasanian, avesta, was, then, compiled, into, 21, nasks, divisions, to, correspond, with, the, 21, words, of, the, ahunavar, invocation, an, important, literary, text, the, khwaday, namag, book, of, kings, was, composed, during, the, sasanian, era, this, text, is, the, basis, of, the, later, shahnameh, of, ferdowsi, another, important, zoroastrian, text, from, the, sasanian, period, includes, the, dadestan, e, menog, e, khrad, judgments, of, the, spirit, of, wisdom, christians, in, the, sasanian, empire, belonged, mainly, to, the, nestorian, church, church, of, the, east, and, the, jacobite, church, syriac, orthodox, church, although, these, churches, originally, maintained, ties, with, christian, churches, in, the, roman, empire, they, were, quite, different, from, them, the, liturgical, language, of, the, nestorian, and, jacobite, churches, was, syriac, rather, than, greek, another, reason, for, a, separation, between, eastern, and, western, christianity, was, strong, pressure, from, the, sasanian, authorities, to, sever, connections, with, rome, since, the, sasanian, empire, was, often, at, war, with, the, roman, empire, christianity, was, recognized, by, yazdegerd, i, in, 409, as, an, allowable, faith, within, the, sasanian, empire, the, major, break, with, mainstream, christianity, came, in, 431, due, to, the, pronouncements, of, the, first, council, of, ephesus, the, council, condemned, nestorius, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, for, teaching, a, view, of, christology, in, accordance, with, which, he, refused, to, call, mary, mother, of, jesus, theotokos, or, mother, of, god, while, the, teaching, of, the, council, of, ephesus, was, accepted, within, the, roman, empire, the, sasanian, church, disagreed, with, the, condemnation, of, nestorius, teachings, when, nestorius, was, deposed, as, patriarch, a, number, of, his, followers, fled, to, the, sasanian, empire, persian, emperors, used, this, opportunity, to, strengthen, nestorius, position, within, the, sasanian, church, which, made, up, the, vast, majority, of, the, christians, in, the, predominantly, zoroastrian, persian, empire, by, eliminating, the,
