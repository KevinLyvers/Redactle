the, achaemenid, empire, and, then, the, roman, empire, its, capital, was, sardis, at, some, point, before, 800, bc, the, lydian, people, achieved, some, sort, of, political, cohesion, and, existed, as, an, independent, kingdom, by, the, 600s, bc, at, its, greatest, extent, during, the, 7th, century, bc, it, covered, all, of, western, anatolia, in, 546, bc, it, became, a, satrapy, of, the, achaemenid, empire, known, as, sparda, in, old, persian, in, 133, bc, it, became, part, of, the, roman, province, of, asia, lydian, coins, made, of, silver, are, among, the, oldest, in, existence, dated, to, around, the, 7th, century, bc, lydia, is, generally, located, east, of, ancient, ionia, in, the, modern, western, turkish, provinces, of, u, ak, manisa, and, inland, izmir, the, boundaries, of, historical, lydia, varied, across, the, centuries, it, was, bounded, first, by, mysia, caria, phrygia, and, coastal, ionia, later, the, military, power, of, alyattes, and, croesus, expanded, lydia, which, with, its, capital, at, sardis, controlled, all, asia, minor, west, of, the, river, halys, except, lycia, after, the, persian, conquest, the, river, maeander, was, regarded, as, its, southern, boundary, and, during, imperial, roman, times, lydia, comprised, the, country, between, mysia, and, caria, on, the, one, side, and, phrygia, and, the, aegean, sea, on, the, other, the, lydian, language, was, an, indo, european, language, in, the, anatolian, language, family, related, to, luwian, and, hittite, due, to, its, fragmentary, attestation, the, meanings, of, many, words, are, unknown, but, much, of, the, grammar, has, been, determined, similar, to, other, anatolian, languages, it, featured, extensive, use, of, prefixes, and, grammatical, particles, to, chain, clauses, together, lydian, had, also, undergone, extensive, syncope, leading, to, numerous, consonant, clusters, atypical, of, most, indo, european, languages, lydian, finally, became, extinct, during, the, 1st, century, bc, the, lydian, language, is, usually, not, categorized, as, part, of, the, luwic, subgroup, unlike, the, other, nearby, anatolian, languages, luwian, carian, and, lycian, lydia, s, early, history, remains, shrouded, in, obscurity, during, the, late, bronze, age, 1600, bc, 1200, bc, the, territory, that, later, became, lydia, overlapped, with, two, kingdoms, called, mira, and, e, a, themselves, part, of, a, broader, political, entity, called, arzawa, like, the, other, arzawa, lands, these, kingdoms, had, tumultuous, relations, with, the, hittite, empire, acting, both, as, allies, enemies, and, vassals, at, various, points, in, time, by, roughly, 800, bc, the, lydian, people, appear, to, have, established, their, presence, and, achieved, some, degree, of, political, cohesion, however, precise, dates, and, events, are, impossible, to, determine, due, to, the, absence, of, contemporary, written, records, the, only, firm, evidence, for, this, early, period, comes, from, the, archaeological, excavations, at, sardis, although, certain, literary, accounts, purport, the, existence, of, two, early, lydian, dynasties, namely, the, house, of, atys, after, whose, son, lydus, the, lydians, were, supposedly, named, and, the, heraclids, who, allegedly, ruled, for, twenty, two, generations, before, 685, bc, these, sources, are, steeped, in, mythology, and, lack, historical, credibility, lydia, was, an, independent, kingdom, from, an, unknown, time, in, the, until, 546, bc, according, to, herodotus, one, of, lydus, s, descendants, was, iardanus, with, whom, heracles, was, in, service, at, one, time, heracles, had, an, affair, with, one, of, iardanus, slave, girls, and, their, son, alcaeus, was, the, first, of, the, heraclid, dynasty, said, to, have, ruled, lydia, for, 22, generations, starting, with, agron, in, the, 8th, century, bc, meles, became, the, 21st, and, penultimate, heraclid, king, and, the, last, was, his, son, candaules, died, c, 687, bc, gyges, is, the, first, king, whose, existence, is, demonstrable, from, contemporary, records, according, to, semi, mythical, accounts, of, his, reign, he, was, the, son, of, a, man, named, dascylus, and, came, to, power, by, overthrowing, king, candaules, with, the, assistance, of, a, carian, prince, from, mylasa, named, arselis, gyges, s, rise, to, power, happened, in, the, context, of, a, period, of, turmoil, following, the, invasion, of, the, cimmerians, a, nomadic, people, from, the, pontic, steppe, who, had, invaded, western, asia, who, around, 675, bc, destroyed, the, previous, major, power, in, anatolia, the, kingdom, of, phrygia, gyges, took, advantage, of, the, power, vacuum, created, by, the, cimmerian, invasions, to, consolidate, his, kingdom, and, make, it, a, military, power, he, contacted, the, neo, assyrian, court, by, sending, diplomats, to, nineveh, to, seek, help, against, the, cimmerian, invasions, and, he, attacked, the, ionian, greek, cities, of, miletus, smyrna, and, colophon, gyges, s, extensive, alliances, with, the, carian, dynasts, allowed, him, to, recruit, carian, and, ionian, greek, soldiers, to, send, overseas, to, assist, the, egyptian, king, psamtik, i, of, the, city, of, sais, with, whom, he, had, established, contacts, around, 662, bc, with, the, help, of, these, armed, forces, psamtik, i, united, egypt, under, his, rule, after, eliminating, the, eleven, other, kinglets, with, whom, he, had, been, co, ruling, lower, egypt, in, 644, bc, lydia, faced, a, third, attack, by, the, cimmerians, led, by, their, king, lygdamis, this, time, the, lydians, were, defeated, sardis, was, sacked, and, gyges, was, killed, gyges, was, succeeded, by, his, son, ardys, who, resumed, diplomatic, activity, with, assyria, and, would, also, have, to, face, the, cimmerians, ardys, attacked, the, ionian, greek, city, of, miletus, and, succeeded, in, capturing, the, city, of, priene, after, which, priene, would, remain, under, direct, rule, of, the, lydian, kingdom, until, its, end, ardys, s, reign, was, short, lived, and, in, 637, bc, that, is, in, ardys, s, seventh, regnal, year, the, thracian, treres, tribe, who, had, migrated, across, the, thracian, bosporus, and, invaded, anatolia, under, their, king, kobos, and, in, alliance, with, the, cimmerians, and, the, lycians, attacked, lydia, they, defeated, the, lydians, again, and, for, a, second, time, sacked, the, lydian, capital, of, sardis, except, for, its, citadel, it, is, probable, that, ardys, was, killed, during, this, cimmerian, attack, ardys, was, succeeded, by, his, son, sadyattes, who, had, an, even, more, short, lived, reign, sadyattes, died, in, 635, bc, and, it, is, possible, that, like, his, grandfather, gyges, and, maybe, his, father, ardys, as, well, he, died, fighting, the, cimmerians, amidst, extreme, turmoil, sadyattes, was, succeeded, in, 635, bc, by, his, son, alyattes, who, would, transform, lydia, into, a, powerful, empire, soon, after, alyattes, s, ascension, and, early, during, his, reign, with, assyrian, approval, and, in, alliance, with, the, lydians, the, scythians, under, their, king, madyes, entered, anatolia, expelled, the, treres, from, asia, minor, and, defeated, the, cimmerians, so, that, they, no, longer, constituted, a, threat, again, following, which, the, scythians, extended, their, domination, to, central, anatolia, until, they, were, themselves, expelled, by, the, medes, from, western, asia, in, the, 590s, bc, this, final, defeat, of, the, cimmerians, was, carried, out, by, the, joint, forces, of, madyes, whom, strabo, credits, with, expelling, the, treres, and, cimmerians, from, asia, minor, and, of, alyattes, whom, herodotus, and, polyaenus, claim, finally, defeated, the, cimmerians, alyattes, turned, towards, phrygia, in, the, east, where, extended, lydian, rule, eastwards, to, phrygia, alyattes, continued, his, expansionist, policy, in, the, east, and, of, all, the, peoples, to, the, west, of, the, halys, river, whom, herodotus, claimed, alyattes, s, successor, croesus, ruled, over, the, lydians, phrygians, mysians, mariandyni, chalybes, paphlagonians, thyni, and, bithyni, thracians, carians, ionians, dorians, aeolians, and, pamphylians, it, is, very, likely, that, a, number, of, these, populations, had, already, been, conquered, under, alyattes, and, it, is, not, impossible, that, the, lydians, might, have, subjected, lycia, given, that, the, lycian, coast, would, have, been, important, for, the, lydians, because, it, was, close, to, a, trade, route, connecting, the, aegean, region, the, levant, and, cyprus, alyattes, s, eastern, conquests, brought, the, lydian, empire, in, conflict, in, the, 590s, bc, with, the, medes, and, a, war, broke, out, between, the, median, and, lydian, empires, in, 590, bc, which, was, waged, in, eastern, anatolia, lasted, five, years, until, a, solar, eclipse, occurred, in, 585, bc, during, a, battle, hence, called, the, battle, of, the, eclipse, opposing, the, lydian, and, median, armies, which, both, sides, interpreted, as, an, omen, to, end, the, war, the, babylonian, king, nebuchadnezzar, ii, and, the, king, syennesis, of, cilicia, acted, as, mediators, in, the, ensuing, peace, treaty, which, was, sealed, by, the, marriage, of, the, median, king, cyaxares, s, son, astyages, with, alyattes, s, daughter, aryenis, and, the, possible, wedding, of, a, daughter, of, cyaxares, with, either, alyattes, or, with, his, son, croesus, alyattes, died, shortly, after, the, battle, of, the, eclipse, in, 585, bc, itself, following, which, lydia, faced, a, power, struggle, between, his, son, pantaleon, born, from, a, greek, woman, and, his, other, son, croesus, born, from, a, carian, noblewoman, out, of, which, the, latter, emerged, successful, croesus, brought, caria, under, the, direct, control, of, the, lydian, empire, and, he, subjugated, all, of, mainland, ionia, aeolis, and, doris, but, he, abandoned, his, plans, of, annexing, the, greek, city, states, on, the, islands, of, the, aegean, sea, and, he, instead, concluded, treaties, of, friendship, with, them, which, might, have, helped, him, participate, in, the, lucrative, trade, the, aegean, greeks, carried, out, with, egypt, at, naucratis, according, to, herodotus, croesus, ruled, over, all, the, peoples, to, the, west, of, the, halys, river, although, the, actual, border, of, his, kingdom, was, further, to, the, east, of, the, halys, at, an, undetermined, point, in, eastern, anatolia, croesus, continued, the, friendly, relations, with, the, medes, concluded, between, his, father, alyattes, and, the, median, king, cyaxares, and, he, continued, these, good, relations, with, the, medes, after, he, succeeded, alyattes, and, astyages, succeeded, cyaxares, and, under, croesus, s, rule, lydia, continued, its, good, relations, started, by, gyges, with, the, saite, egyptian, kingdom, then, ruled, by, the, pharaoh, amasis, ii, croesus, also, established, trade, and, diplomatic, relations, with, the, neo, babylonian, empire, of, nabonidus, and, he, further, increased, his, contacts, with, the, greeks, on, the, european, continent, by, establishing, relations, with, the, city, state, of, sparta, in, 550, bc, croesus, s, brother, in, law, the, median, king, astyages, was, overthrown, by, his, own, grandson, the, persian, king, cyrus, the, great, and, croesus, responded, by, attacking, pteria, the, capital, of, a, phrygian, state, vassal, to, the, lydians, which, might, have, attempted, to, declare, its, allegiance, to, the, new, persian, empire, of, cyrus, cyrus, retaliated, by, intervening, in, cappadocia, and, defeated, the, lydians, at, pteria, in, a, battle, and, again, at, thymbra, before, besieging, and, capturing, the, lydian, capital, of, sardis, thus, bringing, an, end, to, the, rule, of, the, mermnad, dynasty, and, to, the, lydian, empire, lydia, would, never, regain, its, independence, and, would, remain, a, part, of, various, successive, empires, although, the, dates, for, the, battles, of, pteria, and, thymbra, and, of, end, of, the, lydian, empire, have, been, traditionally, fixed, to, 547, bc, more, recent, estimates, suggest, that, herodotus, s, account, being, unreliable, chronologically, concerning, the, fall, of, lydia, means, that, there, are, currently, no, ways, of, dating, the, end, of, the, lydian, kingdom, theoretically, it, may, even, have, taken, place, after, the, fall, of, babylon, in, 539, bc, in, 547, bc, the, lydian, king, croesus, besieged, and, captured, the, persian, city, of, pteria, in, cappadocia, and, enslaved, its, inhabitants, the, persian, king, cyrus, the, great, marched, with, his, army, against, the, lydians, the, battle, of, pteria, resulted, in, a, stalemate, forcing, the, lydians, to, retreat, to, their, capital, city, of, sardis, some, months, later, the, persian, and, lydian, kings, met, at, the, battle, of, thymbra, cyrus, won, and, captured, the, capital, city, of, sardis, by, 546, bc, lydia, became, a, province, satrapy, of, the, persian, empire, lydia, remained, a, satrapy, after, persia, s, conquest, by, the, macedonian, king, alexander, iii, the, great, of, macedon, when, alexander, s, empire, ended, after, his, death, lydia, was, possessed, by, the, major, asian, diadoch, dynasty, the, seleucids, and, when, it, was, unable, to, maintain, its, territory, in, asia, minor, lydia, was, acquired, by, the, attalid, dynasty, of, pergamum, its, last, king, avoided, the, spoils, and, ravage, of, a, roman, war, of, conquest, by, leaving, the, realm, by, testament, to, the, roman, empire, when, the, romans, entered, the, capital, sardis, in, 133, bc, lydia, as, the, other, western, parts, of, the, attalid, legacy, became, part, of, the, province, of, asia, a, very, rich, roman, province, worthy, of, a, governor, with, the, high, rank, of, proconsul, the, whole, west, of, asia, minor, had, jewish, colonies, very, early, and, christianity, was, also, soon, present, there, acts, of, the, apostles, 16, 14, 15, mentions, the, baptism, of, a, merchant, woman, called, lydia, from, thyatira, known, as, lydia, of, thyatira, in, what, had, once, been, the, satrapy, of, lydia, christianity, spread, rapidly, during, the, 3rd, century, ad, based, on, the, nearby, exarchate, of, ephesus, under, the, tetrarchy, reform, of, emperor, diocletian, in, 296, ad, lydia, was, revived, as, the, name, of, a, separate, roman, province, much, smaller, than, the, former, satrapy, with, its, capital, at, sardis, together, with, the, provinces, of, caria, hellespontus, lycia, pamphylia, phrygia, prima, and, phrygia, secunda, pisidia, all, in, modern, turkey, and, the, insulae, ionian, islands, mostly, in, modern, greece, it, formed, the, diocese, under, a, vicarius, of, asiana, which, was, part, of, the, praetorian, prefecture, of, oriens, together, with, the, dioceses, pontiana, most, of, the, rest, of, asia, minor, oriens, proper, mainly, syria, aegyptus, egypt, and, thraciae, on, the, balkans, roughly, bulgaria, under, the, byzantine, emperor, heraclius, 610, 641, lydia, became, part, of, anatolikon, one, of, the, original, themata, and, later, of, thrakesion, although, the, seljuk, turks, conquered, most, of, the, rest, of, anatolia, forming, the, sultanate, of, ikonion, konya, lydia, remained, part, of, the, byzantine, empire, while, the, venetians, occupied, constantinople, and, greece, as, a, result, of, the, fourth, crusade, lydia, continued, as, a, part, of, the, byzantine, rump, state, called, the, nicene, empire, based, at, nicaea, until, 1261, lydia, was, captured, finally, by, turkish, beyliks, which, were, all, absorbed, by, the, ottoman, state, in, 1390, the, area, became, part, of, the, ottoman, aidin, vilayet, province, and, is, now, in, the, modern, republic, of, turkey, according, to, herodotus, the, lydians, were, the, first, people, to, use, gold, and, silver, coins, and, the, first, to, establish, retail, shops, in, permanent, locations, it, is, not, known, however, whether, herodotus, meant, that, the, lydians, were, the, first, to, use, coins, of, pure, gold, and, pure, silver, or, the, first, precious, metal, coins, in, general, despite, this, ambiguity, this, statement, of, herodotus, is, one, of, the, pieces, of, evidence, most, often, cited, on, behalf, of, the, argument, that, lydians, invented, coinage, at, least, in, the, west, although, the, first, coins, under, alyattes, i, reigned, c, 591, c, 560, bc, were, neither, gold, nor, silver, but, an, alloy, of, the, two, called, electrum, the, dating, of, these, first, stamped, coins, is, one, of, the, most, frequently, debated, topics, of, ancient, numismatics, with, dates, ranging, from, 700, bc, to, 550, bc, but, the, most, common, opinion, is, that, they, were, minted, at, or, near, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, king, alyattes, sometimes, referred, to, incorrectly, as, alyattes, ii, the, first, coins, were, made, of, electrum, an, alloy, of, gold, and, silver, that, occurs, naturally, but, that, was, further, debased, by, the, lydians, with, added, silver, and, copper, the, largest, of, these, coins, are, commonly, referred, to, as, a, 1, 3, stater, trite, denomination, weighing, around, 4, 7, grams, though, no, full, staters, of, this, type, have, ever, been, found, and, the, 1, 3, stater, probably, should, be, referred, to, more, correctly, as, a, stater, after, a, type, of, a, transversely, held, scale, the, weights, used, in, such, a, scale, from, ancient, greek, to, stand, which, also, means, standard, these, coins, were, stamped, with, a, lion, s, head, adorned, with, what, is, likely, a, sunburst, which, was, the, king, s, symbol, the, most, prolific, mint, for, early, electrum, coins, was, sardis, which, produced, large, quantities, of, the, lion, head, thirds, sixths, and, twelfths, along, with, lion, paw, fractions, to, complement, the, largest, denomination, fractions, were, made, including, a, hekte, sixth, hemihekte, twelfth, and, so, forth, down, to, a, 96th, with, the, 1, 96, stater, weighing, only, about, 0, 15, grams, there, is, disagreement, however, over, whether, the, fractions, below, the, twelfth, are, actually, lydian, alyattes, son, was, croesus, reigned, c, 560, c, 546, bc, who, became, associated, with, great, wealth, croesus, is, credited, with, issuing, the, croeseid, the, first, true, gold, coins, with, a, standardised, purity, for, general, circulation, and, the, world, s, first, bimetallic, monetary, system, circa, 550, bc, it, took, some, time, before, ancient, coins, were, used, for, commerce, and, trade, even, the, smallest, denomination, electrum, coins, perhaps, worth, about, a, day, s, subsistence, would, have, been, too, valuable, for, buying, a, loaf, of, bread, the, first, coins, to, be, used, for, retailing, on, a, large, scale, basis, were, likely, small, silver, fractions, hemiobol, ancient, greek, coinage, minted, in, cyme, aeolis, under, hermodike, ii, then, by, the, ionian, greeks, in, the, late, sixth, century, bc, sardis, was, renowned, as, a, beautiful, city, around, 550, bc, near, the, beginning, of, his, reign, croesus, paid, for, the, construction, of, the, temple, of, artemis, at, ephesus, which, became, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, croesus, was, defeated, in, battle, by, cyrus, ii, of, persia, in, 546, bc, with, the, lydian, kingdom, losing, its, autonomy, and, becoming, a, persian, satrapy, for, the, greeks, tantalus, was, a, primordial, ruler, of, mythic, lydia, and, niobe, his, proud, daughter, her, husband, amphion, associated, lydia, with, thebes, in, greece, and, through, pelops, the, line, of, tantalus, was, part, of, the, founding, myths, of, mycenae, s, second, dynasty, in, reference, to, the, myth, of, bellerophon, karl, kerenyi, remarked, in, the, heroes, of, the, greeks, 1959, p, 83, as, lykia, was, thus, connected, with, crete, and, as, the, person, of, pelops, the, hero, of, olympia, connected, lydia, with, the, peloponnesos, so, bellerophontes, connected, another, asian, country, or, rather, two, lykia, and, karia, with, the, kingdom, of, argos, in, greek, myth, lydia, had, also, adopted, the, double, axe, symbol, that, also, appears, in, the, mycenaean, civilization, the, labrys, omphale, daughter, of, the, river, iardanos, was, a, ruler, of, lydia, whom, heracles, was, required, to, serve, for, a, time, his, adventures, in, lydia, are, the, adventures, of, a, greek, hero, in, a, peripheral, and, foreign, land, during, his, stay, heracles, enslaved, the, itones, killed, syleus, who, forced, passers, by, to, hoe, his, vineyard, slew, the, serpent, of, the, river, sangarios, which, appears, in, the, heavens, as, the, constellation, ophiucus, and, captured, the, simian, tricksters, the, cercopes, accounts, tell, of, at, least, one, son, of, heracles, who, was, born, to, either, omphale, or, a, slave, girl, herodotus, histories, i, 7, says, this, was, alcaeus, who, began, the, line, of, lydian, heracleidae, which, ended, with, the, death, of, candaules, c, 687, bc, diodorus, siculus, 4, 31, 8, and, ovid, heroides, 9, 54, mentions, a, son, called, lamos, while, pseudo, apollodorus, bibliotheke, 2, 7, 8, gives, the, name, agelaus, and, pausanias, 2, 21, 3, names, tyrsenus, as, the, son, of, heracles, by, the, lydian, woman, all, three, heroic, ancestors, indicate, a, lydian, dynasty, claiming, heracles, as, their, ancestor, herodotus, 1, 7, refers, to, a, heraclid, dynasty, of, kings, who, ruled, lydia, yet, were, perhaps, not, descended, from, omphale, he, also, mentions, 1, 94, the, legend, that, the, etruscan, civilization, was, founded, by, colonists, from, lydia, led, by, tyrrhenus, brother, of, lydus, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, was, skeptical, of, this, story, indicating, that, the, etruscan, language, and, customs, were, known, to, be, totally, dissimilar, to, those, of, the, lydians, in, addition, the, story, of, the, lydian, origins, of, the, etruscans, was, not, known, to, xanthus, of, lydia, an, authority, on, the, history, of, the, lydians, later, chronologists, ignored, herodotus, statement, that, agron, was, the, first, heraclid, to, be, a, king, and, included, his, immediate, forefathers, alcaeus, belus, and, ninus, in, their, list, of, kings, of, lydia, strabo, 5, 2, 2, has, atys, father, of, lydus, and, tyrrhenus, as, a, descendant, of, heracles, and, omphale, but, that, contradicts, virtually, all, other, accounts, which, name, atys, lydus, and, tyrrhenus, among, the, pre, heraclid, kings, and, princes, of, lydia, the, gold, deposits, in, the, river, pactolus, that, were, the, source, of, the, proverbial, wealth, of, croesus, lydia, s, last, king, were, said, to, have, been, left, there, when, the, legendary, king, midas, of, phrygia, washed, away, the, midas, touch, in, its, waters, in, euripides, tragedy, the, bacchae, dionysus, while, maintaining, his, human, disguise, declares, his, country, to, be, lydia, the, relationship, between, the, etruscans, of, northern, and, central, italy, and, the, lydians, has, long, been, a, subject, of, conjecture, the, greek, historian, herodotus, believed, they, came, from, lydia, but, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, a, 1st, century, bc, historian, argued, that, the, etruscans, were, indigenous, to, italy, and, unrelated, to, the, lydians, dionysius, pointed, out, that, the, 5th, century, historian, xanthus, of, lydia, who, was, regarded, as, an, important, source, and, authority, for, the, history, of, lydia, never, linked, the, etruscans, to, lydia, or, mentioned, tyrrhenus, as, a, lydian, ruler, in, contemporary, scholarship, etruscologists, overwhelmingly, support, an, indigenous, origin, for, the, etruscans, dismissing, herodotus, account, as, based, on, erroneous, etymologies, michael, grant, argue, that, the, etruscans, may, have, propagated, this, narrative, to, facilitate, their, trading, in, asia, minor, when, many, cities, in, asia, minor, and, the, etruscans, themselves, were, at, war, with, the, greeks, the, french, scholar, dominique, briquel, contends, that, the, story, of, an, exodus, from, lydia, to, italy, was, a, deliberate, political, fabrication, created, in, the, hellenized, milieu, of, the, court, at, sardis, in, the, early, 6th, century, bc, ultimately, these, greek, authored, accounts, of, the, etruscan, origins, are, only, the, expression, of, the, image, that, etruscans, allies, or, adversaries, wanted, to, divulge, and, should, not, be, considered, historical, archaeological, evidence, does, not, support, the, idea, of, lydian, migration, to, etruria, the, etruscan, civilization, s, earliest, phase, the, villanovan, culture, emerged, around, 900, bc, which, itself, developed, from, the, previous, proto, villanovan, culture, of, italy, in, the, late, bronze, age, this, culture, has, no, ties, to, asia, minor, or, the, near, east, linguists, have, identified, an, etruscan, like, language, in, a, set, of, inscriptions, on, lemnos, island, in, the, aegean, sea, since, the, etruscan, language, was, a, pre, indo, european, language, and, neither, indo, european, or, semitic, etruscan, was, not, related, to, lydian, which, was, a, part, of, the, anatolian, branch, of, the, indo, european, languages, instead, etruscan, language, is, considered, part, of, the, pre, indo, european, tyrrhenian, language, family, along, with, the, lemnian, and, rhaetian, language, a, 2013, genetic, study, suggested, that, the, maternal, lineages, of, western, anatolians, and, modern, tuscans, had, been, largely, separate, for, 5, 000, to, 10, 000, years, with, etruscan, mtdna, closely, resembling, modern, tuscans, and, neolithic, central, european, populations, this, suggests, etruscans, descended, from, the, villanovan, culture, indicating, their, indigenous, roots, and, a, link, between, etruria, modern, tuscany, and, lydia, dating, back, to, the, neolithic, period, during, the, migration, of, early, european, farmers, from, anatolia, to, europe, a, 2019, genetic, study, revealed, that, etruscans, 900, 600, bc, and, latins, 900, 500, bc, from, latium, vetus, shared, genetic, similarities, with, both, groups, having, a, mixture, of, two, thirds, copper, age, ancestry, and, one, third, steppe, related, ancestry, this, study, also, suggested, indigenous, origins, for, the, etruscans, despite, their, pre, indo, european, language, a, 2021, study, confirmed, these, findings, showing, that, etruscans, and, latins, in, the, iron, age, had, similar, genetic, profiles, and, were, part, of, the, european, cluster, the, etruscan, dna, was, completely, absent, a, signal, of, recent, admixture, with, anatolia, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, etruscans, exhibited, a, blend, of, whg,

religion, which, remains, marginally, attested, due, to, the, known, sources, covering, it, being, largely, of, greek, origin, while, lydian, inscriptions, regarding, religion, are, small, in, number, and, no, lydian, corpus, of, ritual, texts, like, the, hittite, ritual, tablets, have, been, recovered, despite, the, small, size, of, the, recorded, lydian, corpus, the, various, inscriptions, relating, to, religion, date, from, c, 650, to, c, 330, 325, bc, thus, covering, the, period, beginning, with, the, establishment, of, the, mermnad, dynasty, under, gyges, and, ending, with, the, aftermath, of, the, macedonian, conquest, under, alexander, iii, and, the, beginning, of, the, hellenistic, period, based, on, limited, evidence, lydian, religious, practices, were, centred, around, the, fertility, of, nature, as, was, common, among, ancient, societies, which, depended, on, the, successful, cultivation, of, land, the, early, lydian, religion, exhibited, strong, connections, to, anatolian, as, well, as, greek, traditions, and, its, pantheon, was, composed, of, native, lydian, deities, who, were, reflexes, of, earlier, aegean, balkan, ones, as, well, as, anatolian, deities, the, latter, of, whom, held, lesser, roles, although, lydia, had, been, conquered, by, the, achaemenid, empire, in, c, 547, bc, native, lydian, traditions, were, not, destroyed, by, persian, rule, and, most, lydian, inscriptions, were, written, during, this, period, the, lydian, religion, was, polytheistic, in, nature, and, was, composed, of, a, number, of, deities, because, of, a, lack, of, evidence, little, is, known, on, the, organisation, of, lydian, cults, due, to, the, meagre, evidence, for, lydian, religious, spaces, little, is, known, about, their, shapes, sizes, administration, and, location, lydian, cultic, spaces, ranged, from, small, places, of, worship, to, prestigious, temples, of, the, state, cult, which, also, had, a, political, role, although, the, evidence, for, them, dates, from, after, the, end, of, lydian, independence, while, those, from, the, lydian, empire, are, primarily, known, from, greek, literature, rather, than, from, archaeological, evidence, the, early, lydian, religion, possessed, at, least, three, cultic, officiants, consisting, of, in, addition, to, these, clerical, offices, the, religious, role, of, the, kings, among, other, anatolian, peoples, suggests, that, lydian, kings, were, also, religious, high, functionaries, who, participated, in, the, cult, as, a, representative, of, divine, power, on, earth, and, claimed, their, legitimacy, to, rule, from, the, gods, anatolian, and, hellenistic, greek, parallels, also, suggest, that, lydian, kings, might, have, been, deified, after, their, deaths, lydia, later, had,
