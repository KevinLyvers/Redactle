posadnik, and, tysyatsky, remained, in, the, hands, of, boyar, families, the, boyars, also, gave, funding, to, the, ushkuyniki, who, contributed, to, the, expansion, of, novgorod, s, trade, and, colonies, in, the, north, of, european, russia, by, the, 14th, century, the, prince, of, moscow, who, was, almost, always, the, grand, prince, of, vladimir, was, usually, the, prince, of, novgorod, as, well, as, moscow, grew, in, power, in, the, 15th, century, novgorod, began, to, lose, its, autonomy, in, a, 1471, peace, treaty, with, moscow, following, the, battle, of, shelon, novgorod, pledged, allegiance, to, moscow, with, its, system, of, government, temporarily, left, intact, the, end, of, the, republic, and, the, veche, came, in, 1478, when, ivan, iii, once, again, invaded, and, seized, the, city, as, part, of, his, campaign, to, annex, all, other, russian, states, the, state, was, called, novgorod, and, great, novgorod, russian, romanized, velikiy, novgorod, with, the, form,

the, land, belonging, to, novgorod, novgorod, republic, russian, romanized, novgorodskaya, respublika, itself, is, a, much, later, term, although, the, polity, was, described, as, a, republic, as, early, as, in, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, soviet, historians, frequently, used, the, terms, novgorod, feudal, republic, and, novgorod, boyar, republic, the, area, of, novgorod, was, populated, by, various, east, slavic, tribes, that, were, constantly, at, war, with, one, another, for, supremacy, however, these, tribes, came, together, during, the, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, to, try, to, form, a, negotiated, settlement, to, end, military, aggression, amongst, each, other, the, novgorod, first, chronicle, a, collection, of, writings, depicting, the, history, of, novgorod, from, 1016, to, 1471, states, that, these, tribes, wanted, to, seek, a, prince, who, may, rule, over, us, and, judge, us, according, to, law, according, to, tradition, novgorod, was, where, the, varangians, were, invited, to, rule, over, what, is, now, northwestern, russia, in, 862, and, the, birthplace, of, its, monarchy, the, russian, scandinavian, cultural, symbiosis, became, prevalent, following, the, establishment, of, the, rus, state, the, novgorodians, were, the, first, to, reach, the, regions, between, the, arctic, ocean, and, lake, onega, even, though, there, is, no, definitive, account, of, the, precise, timing, of, their, arrival, at, the, northern, rivers, that, flowed, into, the, arctic, there, are, chronicles, which, mention, that, one, expedition, reached, the, pechora, river, in, 1032, and, trading, was, established, as, early, as, 1096, with, the, yugra, tribes, the, chronicle, mentions, novgorodians, traveling, beyond, the, portage, as, early, as, 1079, they, also, traveled, to, pomorye, the, summer, coast, of, the, cold, sea, in, search, of, furs, as, well, as, fish, and, salt, historian, george, lantzeff, remarked, that, in, the, beginning, of, russian, history, two, russian, principalities, novgorod, and, rostov, suzdal, were, engaged, in, exploring, conquering, exploiting, and, colonizing, the, area, west, of, the, ural, mountains, from, the, late, 11th, century, the, novgorodians, asserted, greater, control, over, the, determination, of, their, rules, and, rejected, a, politically, dependent, relationship, to, kiev, chronicles, state, that, the, novgorodians, paid, tribute, to, the, grand, prince, of, kiev, by, 1113, some, time, after, this, the, administration, of, the, principality, seemed, to, have, matured, the, novgorodian, tysyatsky, and, posadniki, appointed, boyars, from, the, cities, and, collected, revenues, for, administration, in, the, territories, it, held, a, charter, from, the, 1130s, mentioned, 30, administrative, posts, in, the, territory, of, novgorod, where, revenues, were, collected, regularly, and, sent, as, a, tithe, to, the, novgorod, bishop, throughout, the, 12th, century, novgorod, utilized, the, baltic, volga, caspian, trade, route, not, only, for, trading, but, also, for, bringing, food, from, the, fertile, oka, region, to, their, city, in, 1136, the, novgorodians, dismissed, their, prince, vsevolod, mstislavich, and, over, the, next, century, and, half, were, able, to, invite, in, and, dismiss, a, number, of, princes, however, these, invitations, or, dismissals, were, often, based, on, who, was, the, dominant, prince, in, rus, at, the, time, and, not, on, any, independent, thinking, on, the, part, of, novgorod, rostov, suzdal, comprised, the, territory, of, the, important, oka, region, and, lands, along, the, vital, sheksna, river, this, river, lay, in, the, northern, volga, tributary, region, whoever, controlled, the, river, was, able, to, block, food, supplies, causing, a, famine, in, novgorod, perhaps, due, to, these, fears, novgorod, led, a, failed, invasion, of, suzdal, in, 1134, they, tried, again, and, succeeded, in, 1149, alternatively, novgorod, in, a, bid, to, appease, suzdal, accepted, some, suzdalians, as, rulers, of, novgorod, despite, these, events, suzdal, still, blocked, off, trade, to, novgorod, twice, and, intercepted, novgorod, s, tributes, according, to, russian, sources, during, the, northern, crusades, the, novgorodian, prince, alexander, yaroslavich, defeated, the, swedes, at, the, battle, of, the, neva, in, july, 1240, from, which, he, received, the, sobriquet, nevsky, of, the, neva, alexander, then, defeated, german, crusaders, at, the, battle, on, the, ice, in, 1242, after, the, forces, of, the, exiled, prince, of, pskov, and, men, from, the, bishopric, of, dorpat, attacked, pskov, land, and, votia, a, tributary, of, novgorod, this, later, led, to, him, being, depicted, as, an, ideal, ruler, in, chronicles, such, as, the, life, of, alexander, nevsky, novgorod, was, also, spared, by, the, mongol, armies, during, the, mongol, invasions, after, alexander, nevsky, agreed, to, pay, tribute, historians, such, as, j, l, i, fennell, have, called, the, proportions, of, nevsky, s, victories, as, having, been, overblown, he, also, argued, that, there, was, no, existence, of, a, unified, western, scheme, of, aggression, against, russia, and, that, nevsky, appeased, the, mongols, while, many, russian, historians, have, argued, that, nevsky, was, being, wise, with, cooperation, with, the, mongols, being, the, only, sensible, option, at, the, time, which, averted, further, tragedy, the, city, of, pskov, initially, part, of, novgorod, land, became, de, facto, independent, as, early, as, the, 13th, century, after, opening, a, trading, post, for, merchants, of, the, hanseatic, league, several, princes, such, as, vsevolod, mstislavich, d, 1138, and, dovmont, d, 1299, reigned, in, pskov, without, any, deference, to, or, consultation, with, the, prince, or, other, officials, in, novgorod, the, independence, of, the, pskov, republic, was, acknowledged, in, the, 1348, treaty, of, bolotovo, however, the, archbishop, of, novgorod, continued, to, head, the, church, in, pskov, and, kept, the, title, of, archbishop, of, novgorod, the, great, and, pskov, until, 1589, in, the, 12th, to, 15th, centuries, the, novgorod, republic, expanded, east, and, northeast, the, novgorodians, explored, the, areas, around, lake, onega, along, the, northern, dvina, and, coastlines, of, the, white, sea, at, the, beginning, of, the, 14th, century, the, novgorodians, explored, the, arctic, ocean, the, barents, sea, the, kara, sea, and, the, west, siberian, river, ob, the, lands, to, the, north, of, the, city, rich, with, fur, sea, fauna, and, salt, among, others, were, of, great, economic, importance, to, the, novgorodians, who, fought, a, protracted, series, of, wars, with, moscow, beginning, in, the, late, 14th, century, in, order, to, keep, these, lands, losing, them, meant, economic, and, cultural, decline, for, the, city, and, its, inhabitants, the, ultimate, failure, of, the, novgorodians, to, win, these, wars, led, to, the, downfall, of, the, novgorod, republic, tver, moscow, and, lithuania, fought, over, control, of, novgorod, and, its, enormous, wealth, from, the, 14th, century, upon, becoming, the, grand, prince, of, vladimir, mikhail, yaroslavich, of, tver, sent, his, governors, to, novgorod, a, series, of, disagreements, with, mikhail, pushed, novgorod, towards, closer, ties, with, moscow, during, the, reign, of, yury, in, part, tver, s, proximity, the, tver, principality, was, contiguous, with, novgorod, land, threatened, novgorod, it, was, feared, that, a, tverian, prince, would, annex, novgorod, s, territory, and, thus, weaken, the, republic, at, the, time, though, moscow, did, not, border, novgorod, and, since, the, muscovite, princes, were, further, afield, they, were, more, acceptable, as, princes, of, novgorod, they, could, come, to, novgorod, s, aid, when, needed, but, would, be, too, far, away, to, meddle, too, much, in, the, republic, s, affairs, as, moscow, grew, in, strength, however, the, muscovite, princes, became, a, serious, threat, to, novgorod, ivan, i, simeon, and, other, princes, sought, to, limit, novgorod, s, independence, in, 1397, a, critical, conflict, took, place, between, moscow, and, novgorod, when, moscow, annexed, the, dvina, lands, along, the, course, of, the, northern, dvina, these, lands, were, crucial, to, novgorod, s, well, being, since, much, of, the, city, s, furs, came, from, there, this, territory, was, returned, to, novgorod, the, following, year, novgorod, supported, the, rebellious, dmitry, shemyaka, against, vasily, ii, in, the, muscovite, war, of, succession, after, vasily, ii, returned, to, throne, a, war, between, moscow, and, novgorod, took, place, which, ended, after, the, treaty, of, yazhelbitsy, was, signed, in, 1456, the, treaty, marked, the, beginning, of, the, fall, of, novgorod, s, independence, as, it, lost, certain, freedoms, moscow, began, to, gradually, seize, land, in, the, northern, territories, that, were, formerly, under, novgorod, s, control, for, the, next, decade, and, half, due, to, a, desire, for, luxury, furs, in, the, area, this, led, to, a, struggle, with, novgorod, for, the, russian, fur, trade, and, thus, an, economic, rivalry, for, fur, land, and, trade, ports, some, novgorodian, boyars, were, opposed, to, moscow, as, a, result, while, others, pursued, a, pro, muscovite, policy, in, the, hopes, that, good, relations, with, moscow, would, reduce, disruption, in, novgorod, s, trade, novgorod, was, also, dependent, on, the, russian, lands, to, its, southwest, for, important, imports, such, as, grain, some, novgorodians, were, also, attracted, to, moscow, due, to, it, being, the, center, of, russian, orthodoxy, as, opposed, to, lithuania, where, catholicism, was, dominant, and, its, culture, was, being, increasingly, polonized, though, some, novgorodian, clergy, adopted, a, pro, lithuanian, policy, for, political, reasons, due, to, fears, that, embracing, the, grand, prince, of, moscow, would, eventually, lead, to, the, end, of, novgorod, s, independence, most, novgorodian, boyars, had, hoped, to, maintain, the, republic, s, independence, since, if, novgorod, were, to, be, conquered, the, boyars, wealth, would, flow, to, the, grand, prince, and, muscovite, boyars, and, the, novgorodians, would, fall, into, decline, most, of, them, also, did, not, earn, enough, to, pay, for, war, by, 1470, with, the, pro, lithuanian, faction, being, dominant, the, novgorodian, boyars, questioned, ivan, s, sovereignty, over, novgorod, as, their, prince, novgorod, negotiated, with, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, for, a, new, prince, to, be, sent, over, this, led, to, mikhailo, olelkovich, a, cousin, of, ivan, iii, to, be, accepted, according, to, tradition, marfa, boretskaya, the, wife, of, the, posadnik, isak, boretsky, was, the, main, proponent, of, an, alliance, with, poland, lithuania, to, save, the, republic, according, to, this, legend, boretskaya, invited, the, lithuanian, princeling, mikhailo, olelkovich, and, asked, him, to, become, her, husband, and, the, ruler, of, novgorod, she, also, concluded, an, alliance, with, casimir, the, king, of, poland, and, grand, duke, of, lithuania, the, prospects, of, changing, allegiance, in, favor, of, the, allied, kingdom, of, poland, and, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, caused, a, major, commotion, among, the, commoners, janet, martin, and, gail, lenhoff, have, recently, argued, that, boretskaya, was, scapegoated, probably, by, archbishop, feofil, r, 1470, 1480, in, order, to, shift, the, blame, from, him, for, his, betrayal, of, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, yazhelbitsy, which, forbade, novgorod, from, conducting, foreign, affairs, without, grand, princely, approval, while, the, extent, of, boretskaya, s, role, in, the, lithuanian, party, is, probably, exaggerated, novgorod, did, indeed, try, to, turn, to, the, king, of, poland, a, draft, treaty, allegedly, found, among, the, loot, after, the, battle, of, shelon, river, was, drawn, up, between, casimir, and, the, novgorodians, the, muscovite, authorities, saw, novgorod, s, behavior, as, a, repudiation, of, the, treaty, of, yazhelbitsy, and, went, to, war, against, the, city, the, army, of, moscow, won, a, decisive, victory, in, the, battle, of, shelon, river, in, july, 1471, which, severely, limited, novgorod, s, freedom, to, act, thereafter, although, the, city, maintained, its, formal, independence, for, the, next, six, years, pro, moscow, and, anti, moscow, factions, in, novgorod, competed, with, one, another, ivan, iii, visited, novgorod, several, times, during, this, period, persecuting, a, number, of, pro, lithuanian, boyars, and, confiscating, their, lands, in, 1478, ivan, iii, sent, his, army, to, take, direct, control, of, the, city, he, destroyed, the, veche, tore, down, the, veche, bell, the, ancient, symbol, of, participatory, governance, civil, society, and, legal, rights, and, destroyed, the, library, and, archives, thus, ending, the, independence, of, novgorod, after, the, takeover, ivan, took, more, than, four, fifths, of, novgorod, s, land, half, for, himself, and, the, rest, for, his, allies, the, formal, annexation, of, novgorod, marked, a, major, step, in, the, unification, of, russia, around, moscow, with, ivan, iii, later, adopting, the, title, of, sovereign, of, all, russia, the, novgorod, chronicle, which, had, been, critical, of, ivan, iii, before, the, fall, of, novgorod, thus, described, the, conquest, in, its, aftermath, justifying, it, on, the, grounds, of, purported, conversion, of, novgorodians, to, the, catholic, faith, thus, did, great, prince, ivan, advance, with, all, his, host, against, his, domain, of, novgorod, because, of, the, rebellious, spirit, of, its, people, their, pride, and, conversion, to, latinism, with, a, great, and, overwhelming, force, did, he, occupy, the, entire, territory, of, novgorod, from, frontier, to, frontier, inflicting, on, every, part, of, it, the, dread, powers, of, his, fire, and, sword, the, city, state, of, novgorod, had, developed, procedures, of, governance, that, held, a, large, measure, of, democratic, participation, far, in, advance, of, the, rest, of, europe, but, that, share, several, similarities, with, the, democratic, traditions, of, scandinavian, peasant, republics, the, people, had, the, power, to, elect, city, officials, and, they, even, had, the, power, to, elect, and, remove, the, prince, the, chronicle, writer, then, goes, on, to, describe, a, town, meeting, where, these, decisions, would, have, been, made, which, included, people, from, all, social, classes, ranging, from, the, posadniki, burgomaster, to, the, chernye, liudi, lit, black, folks, or, the, lowest, free, class, the, precise, constitution, of, the, medieval, novgorodian, republic, is, uncertain, although, traditional, histories, have, created, the, image, of, a, highly, institutionalized, network, of, veches, public, assemblies, and, a, government, of, posadniki, burgomaster, tysyatskys, thousandmen, originally, the, head, of, the, town, militia, but, later, a, judicial, and, commercial, official, other, members, of, aristocratic, families, and, the, archbishops, of, novgorod, the, veche, tradition, convinced, novgorodians, that, they, had, the, right, to, be, consulted, on, important, issues, though, in, practice, the, posadniki, came, from, a, few, rich, merchant, families, in, the, early, years, of, the, republic, the, prince, and, posadnik, shared, power, until, the, prince, s, power, was, gradually, restricted, while, the, archbishop, of, novgorod, increasingly, played, the, role, of, head, of, state, particularly, during, times, of, feuds, just, before, 1300, a, series, of, reforms, further, curtailed, the, prince, s, powers, within, the, local, administration, while, those, of, the, archbishop, rose, the, council, of, lords, russian, romanized, sovet, gospod, was, also, formed, and, boyar, families, from, each, district, were, represented, typically, by, former, posadniki, with, each, posadnik, beginning, to, hold, office, for, only, one, year, as, feuds, continued, to, grow, the, structure, was, again, changed, so, that, each, district, had, its, own, posadnik, with, the, number, of, posadniki, increasing, to, 24, in, 1423, though, this, failed, to, achieve, stability, and, feuds, continued, until, the, last, days, of, independence, the, novgorod, judicial, charter, inherited, from, the, earlier, russkaya, pravda, served, as, the, legal, code, of, the, novgorod, republic, from, 1440, the, latest, version, was, supplemented, in, 1471, under, the, auspices, of, ivan, iii, and, his, son, ivan, ivanovich, the, novgorod, judicial, charter, along, with, the, pskov, judicial, charter, were, later, used, for, ivan, iii, s, sudebnik, of, 1497, which, served, as, the, legal, code, for, the, entire, russian, state, novgorod, was, called, a, republic, by, sigismund, von, herberstein, in, his, notes, on, muscovite, affairs, written, at, least, half, a, century, after, the, conquest, of, novgorod, soviet, era, marxist, scholarship, frequently, described, the, political, system, of, novgorod, as, a, feudal, republic, placing, it, within, the, marxist, historiographic, periodization, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, socialism, communism, many, scholars, today, however, question, whether, russia, ever, really, had, a, feudal, political, system, parallel, to, that, of, the, medieval, west, historians, have, also, described, novgorod, s, political, system, as, an, oligarchy, due, to, the, dominance, of, rich, merchant, families, in, politics, some, scholars, argue, that, the, archbishop, was, the, head, of, the, executive, branch, of, the, government, although, it, is, difficult, to, determine, the, exact, competence, of, the, various, officials, it, is, possible, that, there, was, a, council, of, lords, russian, that, was, headed, by, the, archbishop, and, met, in, the, archiepiscopal, palace, and, in, the, chamber, of, facets, after, 1433, the, executives, of, novgorod, at, least, nominally, were, always, the, princes, of, novgorod, invited, by, novgorodians, from, neighboring, states, even, though, their, power, waned, in, the, 13th, and, early, 14th, centuries, it, is, unclear, if, the, archbishop, of, novgorod, was, the, true, head, of, state, or, chief, executive, of, the, novgorod, republic, but, in, any, case, he, remained, an, important, town, official, in, addition, to, overseeing, the, church, in, novgorod, he, headed, embassies, oversaw, certain, court, cases, of, a, secular, nature, and, carried, out, other, secular, tasks, however, the, archbishops, appear, to, have, worked, with, the, boyars, to, reach, a, consensus, and, almost, never, acted, alone, the, archbishop, was, not, appointed, but, elected, by, novgorodians, and, approved, by, the, metropolitan, bishop, of, russia, the, archbishops, were, probably, the, richest, single, land, owners, in, novgorod, and, they, also, made, money, off, court, fees, fees, for, the, use, of, weights, and, measures, in, the, marketplace, and, through, other, means, another, important, executive, was, the, posadnik, of, novgorod, who, chaired, the, veche, co, chaired, courts, together, with, the, prince, oversaw, tax, collection, and, managed, current, affairs, of, the, city, most, of, the, prince, s, major, decisions, had, to, be, approved, by, the, posadnik, in, the, mid, 14th, century, instead, of, one, posadnik, the, veche, began, electing, six, these, six, posadniks, kept, their, status, for, their, lifetimes, and, each, year, elected, among, themselves, a, stepennoy, posadnik, posadniks, were, almost, invariably, boyars, the, city, s, highest, aristocracy, the, precise, makeup, of, the, veche, is, also, uncertain, although, it, appears, to, have, comprised, members, of, the, urban, population, as, well, as, of, the, free, rural, population, whether, it, was, a, democratic, institution, or, one, controlled, by, the, boyars, has, been, hotly, debated, the, posadniks, tysiatskys, and, even, the, bishops, and, archbishops, of, novgorod, were, often, elected, or, at, least, approved, by, the, veche, tradespeople, and, craftsmen, also, participated, in, the, political, affairs, of, novgorod, traditional, scholarship, argues, that, they, were, organized, into, five, kontsy, ends, in, russian, i, e, the, boroughs, of, the, city, they, lived, in, each, end, was, then, organized, by, the, streets, in, which, they, lived, the, ends, and, streets, often, bore, names, indicating, that, certain, trades, were, concentrated, in, certain, parts, of, the, city, there, was, a, carpenter, s, end, and, a, potters, end, for, example, the, merchants, were, organised, into, associations, of, which, the, most, famous, were, those, of, wax, traders, called, ivan, s, hundred, and, of, the, merchants, engaged, in, overseas, trade, like, much, of, the, rest, of, novgorod, s, medieval, history, the, precise, composition, of, these, organizations, is, uncertain, it, is, quite, possible, that, the, ends, and, streets, were, simply, neighborhood, administrative, groups, rather, than, guilds, or, unions, street, organizations, were, known, to, build, churches, in, their, neighborhoods, and, to, have, buried, the, dead, of, their, neighborhoods, during, outbreaks, of, the, plague, but, beyond, that, their, activities, are, uncertain, streets, and, ends, may, have, taken, part, in, political, decision, making, in, novgorod, in, support, of, certain, boyar, factions, or, to, protect, their, interests, merchant, elders, are, also, noted, in, treaties, and, other, charters, but, only, about, a, hundred, of, these, charters, exist, a, half, dozen, date, from, the, 12th, century, while, most, are, from, after, 1262, thus, it, is, difficult, to, determine, novgorod, s, political, structure, due, to, the, paucity, of, sources, the, prince, while, his, status, in, novgorod, was, not, inheritable, and, his, power, was, much, reduced, remained, an, important, figure, in, novgorodian, life, of, around, 100, princes, of, novgorod, many, if, not, most, were, invited, in, or, dismissed,

population, was, dependent, upon, agriculture, and, stock, rearing, while, hunting, and, fishing, were, also, important, the, agricultural, basis, was, also, insecure, as, the, land, passed, almost, fully, into, the, hands, of, ruling, boyars, and, clergy, with, only, a, small, area, belonging, to, merchants, the, peasants, of, novgorod, also, paid, dues, to, their, lords, in, the, products, of,

which, these, were, based, on, class, struggle, is, unclear, many, were, between, various, boyar, factions, or, if, a, revolt, did, involve, the, peasants, or, tradesmen, against, the, boyars, it, did, not, consist, of, the, peasants, wanting, to, overthrow, the, existing, social, order, but, was, more, often, than, not, a, demand, for, better, rule, on, the, part, of, the, ruling, class,
