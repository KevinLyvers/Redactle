epigraphy, from, ancient, greek, epigraph, inscription, is, the, study, of, inscriptions, or, epigraphs, as, writing, it, is, the, science, of, identifying, graphemes, clarifying, their, meanings, classifying, their, uses, according, to, dates, and, cultural, contexts, and, drawing, conclusions, about, the, writing, and, the, writers, specifically, excluded, from, epigraphy, are, the, historical, significance, of, an, epigraph, as, a, document, and, the, artistic, value, of, a, literary, composition, a, person, using, the, methods, of, epigraphy, is, called, an, epigrapher, or, epigraphist, for, example, the, behistun, inscription, is, an, official, document, of, the, achaemenid, empire, engraved, on, native, rock, at, a, location, in, iran, epigraphists, are, responsible, for, reconstructing, translating, and, dating, the, trilingual, inscription, and, finding, any, relevant, circumstances, it, is, the, work, of, historians, however, to, determine, and, interpret, the, events, recorded, by, the, inscription, as, document, often, epigraphy, and, history, are, competences, practised, by, the, same, person, epigraphy, is, a, primary, tool, of, archaeology, when, dealing, with, literate, cultures, the, us, library, of, congress, classifies, epigraphy, as, one, of, the, auxiliary, sciences, of, history, epigraphy, also, helps, identify, a, forgery, epigraphic, evidence, formed, part, of, the, discussion, concerning, the, james, ossuary, an, epigraph, not, to, be, confused, with, epigram, is, any, sort, of, text, from, a, single, grapheme, such, as, marks, on, a, pot, that, abbreviate, the, name, of, the, merchant, who, shipped, commodities, in, the, pot, to, a, lengthy, document, such, as, a, treatise, a, work, of, literature, or, a, hagiographic, inscription, epigraphy, overlaps, other, competences, such, as, numismatics, or, palaeography, when, compared, to, books, most, inscriptions, are, short, the, media, and, the, forms, of, the, graphemes, are, diverse, engravings, in, stone, or, metal, scratches, on, rock, impressions, in, wax, embossing, on, cast, metal, cameo, or, intaglio, on, precious, stones, painting, on, ceramic, or, in, fresco, typically, the, material, is, durable, but, the, durability, might, be, an, accident, of, circumstance, such, as, the, baking, of, a, clay, tablet, in, a, conflagration, the, character, of, the, writing, the, subject, of, epigraphy, is, a, matter, quite, separate, from, the, nature, of, the, text, which, is, studied, in, itself, texts, inscribed, in, stone, are, usually, for, public, view, and, so, they, are, essentially, different, from, the, written, texts, of, each, culture, not, all, inscribed, texts, are, public, however, in, mycenaean, greece, the, deciphered, texts, of, linear, b, were, revealed, to, be, largely, used, for, economic, and, administrative, record, keeping, informal, inscribed, texts, are, graffiti, in, its, original, sense, the, study, of, ideographic, inscriptions, that, is, inscriptions, representing, an, idea, or, concept, may, also, be, called, ideography, the, german, equivalent, sinnbildforschung, was, a, scientific, discipline, in, the, third, reich, but, was, later, dismissed, as, being, highly, ideological, epigraphic, research, overlaps, with, the, study, of, petroglyphs, which, deals, with, specimens, of, pictographic, ideographic, and, logographic, writing, the, study, of, ancient, handwriting, usually, in, ink, is, a, separate, field, palaeography, epigraphy, also, differs, from, iconography, as, it, confines, itself, to, meaningful, symbols, containing, messages, rather, than, dealing, with, images, the, science, of, epigraphy, has, been, developing, steadily, since, the, 16th, century, principles, of, epigraphy, vary, culture, by, culture, and, the, infant, science, in, europe, initially, concentrated, on, latin, inscriptions, individual, contributions, have, been, made, by, epigraphers, such, as, georg, fabricius, 1516, 1571, stefano, antonio, morcelli, 1737, 1822, luigi, gaetano, marini, 1742, 1815, august, wilhelm, zumpt, 1815, 1877, theodor, mommsen, 1817, 1903, emil, h, bner, 1834, 1901, franz, cumont, 1868, 1947, louis, robert, 1904, 1985, the, corpus, inscriptionum, latinarum, begun, by, mommsen, and, other, scholars, has, been, published, in, berlin, since, 1863, with, wartime, interruptions, it, is, the, largest, and, most, extensive, collection, of, latin, inscriptions, new, fascicles, are, still, produced, as, the, recovery, of, inscriptions, continues, the, corpus, is, arranged, geographically, all, inscriptions, from, rome, are, contained, in, volume, 6, this, volume, has, the, greatest, number, of, inscriptions, volume, 6, part, 8, fascicle, 3, was, just, recently, published, 2000, specialists, depend, on, such, on, going, series, of, volumes, in, which, newly, discovered, inscriptions, are, published, often, in, latin, not, unlike, the, biologists, zoological, record, the, raw, material, of, history, greek, epigraphy, has, unfolded, in, the, hands, of, a, different, team, with, different, corpora, there, are, two, the, first, is, corpus, inscriptionum, graecarum, of, which, four, volumes, came, out, again, at, berlin, 1825, 1877, this, marked, a, first, attempt, at, a, comprehensive, publication, of, greek, inscriptions, copied, from, all, over, the, greek, speaking, world, only, advanced, students, still, consult, it, for, better, editions, of, the, texts, have, superseded, it, the, second, modern, corpus, is, inscriptiones, graecae, arranged, geographically, under, categories, decrees, catalogues, honorary, titles, funeral, inscriptions, various, all, presented, in, latin, to, preserve, the, international, neutrality, of, the, field, of, classics, other, such, series, include, the, corpus, inscriptionum, etruscarum, etruscan, inscriptions, corpus, inscriptionum, crucesignatorum, terrae, sanctae, crusaders, inscriptions, corpus, inscriptionum, insularum, celticarum, celtic, inscriptions, corpus, inscriptionum, iranicarum, iranian, inscriptions, royal, inscriptions, of, mesopotamia, and, royal, inscriptions, of, the, neo, assyrian, period, sumerian, and, akkadian, inscriptions, and, so, forth, egyptian, hieroglyphs, were, solved, using, the, rosetta, stone, which, was, a, multilingual, stele, in, classical, greek, demotic, egyptian, and, classical, egyptian, hieroglyphs, the, work, was, done, by, the, french, scholar, jean, fran, ois, champollion, and, the, british, scientist, thomas, young, the, interpretation, of, maya, hieroglyphs, was, lost, as, a, result, of, the, spanish, conquest, of, central, america, however, recent, work, by, maya, epigraphers, and, linguists, has, yielded, a, considerable, amount, of, information, on, this, complex, writing, system, inscriptions, were, commonly, incised, on, stone, marble, metal, terracotta, or, wood, though, this, last, material, has, hardly, ever, survived, except, in, egypt, in, egypt, and, mesopotamia, hard, stones, were, frequently, used, for, the, purpose, and, the, inscriptions, are, therefore, well, preserved, and, easy, to, read, in, greece, the, favourite, material, especially, in, athens, was, white, marble, which, takes, an, admirably, clear, lettering, but, is, liable, to, weathering, of, the, surface, if, exposed, and, to, wear, if, rebuilt, into, pavements, or, similar, structures, many, other, kinds, of, stone, both, hard, and, soft, were, often, used, especially, crystalline, limestones, which, do, not, easily, take, a, smooth, surface, and, which, therefore, are, often, difficult, to, decipher, owing, to, accidental, marks, or, roughness, of, the, material, the, metal, most, commonly, used, for, inscriptions, was, bronze, flat, tablets, of, this, were, often, made, for, affixing, to, the, walls, of, temples, and, other, buildings, occasionally, such, tablets, were, made, of, silver, or, gold, and, inscriptions, were, often, incised, on, vessels, made, of, any, of, these, metals, inscriptions, on, metal, were, nearly, always, incised, not, cast, an, important, class, of, inscriptions, are, the, legends, on, coins, these, were, struck, from, the, die, cf, numismatics, clay, was, very, extensively, used, for, inscriptions, in, mesopotamia, and, in, crete, in, this, case, the, symbols, were, incised, or, impressed, on, specially, prepared, tablets, when, the, clay, was, soft, and, it, was, subsequently, hardened, by, fire, in, greece, many, inscriptions, on, vases, were, painted, before, firing, in, that, case, often, having, reference, to, the, scenes, represented, or, incised, after, firing, potsherds, ostraka, were, often, used, as, a, cheap, writing, material, inscriptions, were, also, often, impressed, from, a, mould, upon, wet, clay, before, firing, in, the, case, of, tiles, amphora, handles, etc, and, in, these, cases, often, supply, valuable, information, as, to, the, buildings, to, which, they, belong, or, the, place, from, which, they, took, their, origin, the, tools, used, for, making, inscriptions, varied, with, the, material, most, of, them, were, some, kind, of, chisel, usually, with, a, square, blade, early, inscriptions, were, sometimes, made, on, hard, rock, by, successive, blows, with, a, punch, or, pointed, hammer, sometimes, a, circular, punch, was, used, for, o, or, a, letter, of, which, o, formed, a, part, early, inscriptions, which, are, often, amateur, work, are, frequently, very, irregular, in, their, cutting, but, in, almost, all, examples, of, later, work, the, inscriptions, are, evidently, cut, by, professionals, and, there, are, definite, styles, and, methods, belonging, to, various, places, and, periods, in, egypt, for, instance, the, hieroglyphs, are, carefully, and, delicately, cut, in, early, times, and, in, later, periods, become, more, careless, and, conventional, in, greece, the, best, work, was, done, in, the, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, in, athens, the, letters, were, all, exact, and, regular, in, shape, with, no, adventitious, ornaments, and, were, especially, in, the, 5th, century, usually, exactly, aligned, with, the, letters, above, and, below, as, well, as, those, on, each, side, at, that, time, all, the, strokes, were, made, of, equal, thickness, but, in, the, 4th, century, bc, and, later, there, came, in, the, custom, of, holding, the, chisel, obliquely, to, the, surface, thus, producing, a, wedge, shaped, stroke, a, similar, custom, in, mesopotamia, gave, rise, to, the, so, called, cuneiform, system, on, metal, inscriptions, in, greece, this, same, effect, appears, earlier, than, stone, or, marble, in, the, 3rd, century, and, later, it, becomes, common, to, introduce, apices, or, ornamental, ends, to, the, strokes, a, custom, which, prevails, to, the, present, day, in, our, ordinary, capital, letters, the, custom, of, making, different, strokes, and, different, parts, of, curves, of, varying, thickness, became, common, in, roman, inscriptions, which, developed, a, monumental, style, of, their, own, varying, from, period, to, period, inscriptions, can, often, be, approximately, dated, by, the, style, of, the, cutting, as, well, as, by, the, shapes, of, the, letters, skill, in, doing, this, can, only, be, acquired, by, a, careful, and, minute, study, of, originals, and, facsimiles, cf, dating, methodologies, in, archaeology, inscriptions, vary, greatly, in, size, according, to, the, position, where, they, were, intended, to, be, read, their, purpose, and, the, skill, of, the, cutter, some, inscriptions, are, of, great, length, the, longest, a, statement, of, accounts, of, the, temple, at, delos, under, athenian, administration, being, nearly, half, as, long, as, a, book, of, thucydides, and, many, other, inscriptions, approach, this, in, length, most, of, the, forms, of, writing, known, to, us, originated, in, some, system, of, picture, writing, cf, also, pictography, which, developed, into, a, hieroglyphic, system, such, systems, appear, to, have, originated, independently, in, different, parts, of, the, world, in, egypt, mesopotamia, crete, among, the, hittites, and, in, china, and, america, the, evidence, for, all, of, these, is, mainly, to, be, found, in, inscriptions, the, development, from, ideographs, or, direct, representation, of, an, object, or, idea, to, symbols, of, phonetic, value, and, so, to, syllabaries, or, alphabets, took, place, in, many, different, systems, to, various, degrees, but, the, first, people, to, invent, a, completely, alphabetic, system, of, writing, were, the, phoenicians, from, whom, the, greeks, borrowed, some, scholars, believe, but, with, no, proving, it, with, certain, modifications, and, improvements, from, the, greeks, was, derived, the, latin, and, from, the, two, all, the, alphabets, of, european, peoples, it, is, still, a, matter, of, dispute, whether, the, phoenician, was, derived, from, the, egyptian, the, hieroglyphic, symbols, naturally, tended, to, be, conventionalised, and, simplified, for, convenience, of, cutting, in, accordance, with, the, materials, and, tools, employed, in, many, cases, they, developed, from, a, pictorial, to, a, linear, form, it, is, possible, that, some, of, these, linear, forms, may, not, be, derived, from, hieroglyphs, but, from, purely, conventional, geometrical, forms, such, as, widely, used, at, all, periods, and, places, as, owners, or, masons, marks, the, tendency, of, linear, forms, to, become, wedge, shaped, is, most, conspicuous, in, cuneiform, but, as, has, been, noticed, the, same, tendency, occurs, in, greek, inscriptions, incised, on, bronze, in, the, north, of, europe, the, ogham, inscriptions, are, alphabetic, and, are, apparently, an, independent, invention, on, arbitrary, lines, like, the, morse, code, but, runes, which, were, extensively, used, in, the, same, region, are, derived, from, the, greek, or, the, latin, alphabets, in, most, alphabetic, systems, there, are, also, found, in, inscriptions, certain, symbols, which, are, not, strictly, alphabetic, or, phonetic, in, character, the, commonest, of, these, are, the, various, systems, of, numerals, that, are, used, in, different, times, and, places, it, is, impossible, here, to, give, any, full, description, of, these, different, systems, but, a, brief, account, may, be, given, of, the, principles, underlying, them, most, of, them, are, based, upon, a, decimal, system, doubtless, owing, to, the, habit, of, counting, on, the, fingers, in, some, cases, the, symbols, are, simple, and, obvious, as, in, the, cretan, script, where, circles, or, rhombi, dots, and, lines, are, used, for, hundreds, tens, and, units, each, being, repeated, as, often, as, necessary, and, a, similar, system, for, the, lower, denominations, is, used, at, epidaurus, in, the, 4th, century, bc, in, athens, the, usual, system, was, to, indicate, each, denomination, by, its, initial, m, for, 10, 000, x, for, 1, 000, h, for, 100, for, 10, for, 5, and, i, for, units, the, other, greek, system, followed, that, derived, from, the, phoenicians, using, the, letters, of, the, alphabet, in, their, conventional, order, from, one, to, nine, 10, to, 90, and, 100, to, 900, in, this, arrangement, obsolete, letters, were, retained, in, their, original, places, so, as, to, give, the, requisite, number, of, 27, symbols, the, roman, system, of, numerals, m, d, c, l, x, v, i, for, 1, 000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5, and, 1, is, generally, supposed, to, have, arisen, from, the, adaptation, of, those, symbols, in, the, greek, alphabet, which, the, romans, did, not, want, an, alternative, theory, is, that, it, is, simplified, from, a, series, of, ideographs, representing, the, spread, hand, the, fingers, and, so, on, apart, from, numerals, the, use, of, initials, in, the, place, of, complete, words, was, not, common, in, early, times, it, became, however, very, frequent, in, roman, inscriptions, which, sometimes, are, made, up, almost, entirely, of, such, abbreviations, and, can, only, be, understood, by, those, familiar, with, the, formulae, a, list, of, the, commonest, of, these, will, be, found, under, list, of, classical, abbreviations, compendia, or, monograms, also, occur, in, later, greek, and, roman, times, and, become, very, common, and, very, difficult, to, interpret, in, early, christian, and, byzantine, inscriptions, some, kind, of, punctuation, is, often, found, in, inscriptions, of, all, kinds, in, greek, inscriptions, a, vertical, line, or, a, dot, or, dots, sometimes, indicates, the, separation, between, sentences, or, words, but, words, are, seldom, separated, by, spaces, as, in, modern, printing, so, that, the, text, is, continuous, and, no, division, of, words, exists, this, is, particularly, the, case, with, greek, inscriptions, of, the, best, period, in, roman, inscriptions, it, was, usual, to, separate, the, words, by, dots, in, certain, inscriptions, a, cross, was, used, to, indicate, the, beginning, of, an, inscription, especially, when, its, direction, was, erratic, christian, inscriptions, sometimes, begin, with, a, cross, which, doubtless, had, a, symbolic, meaning, and, a, leaf, or, other, device, was, often, placed, at, the, end, the, direction, of, the, writing, varies, greatly, in, different, places, and, times, the, letters, or, symbols, may, be, arranged, vertically, below, one, another, and, read, from, top, to, bottom, or, horizontally, either, from, right, to, left, or, from, left, to, right, they, may, also, be, arranged, in, a, kind, of, pattern, in, which, case, their, order, may, be, indeterminate, or, in, a, wandering, or, curved, line, or, left, to, right, and, right, to, left, alternately, boustrophedon, or, as, an, ox, in, ploughing, most, semitic, alphabets, including, phoenician, read, from, right, to, left, and, the, earliest, greek, inscriptions, follow, the, same, direction, but, the, direction, from, left, to, right, became, regular, in, greece, after, the, 6th, century, bc, and, consequently, is, adopted, by, the, romans, and, in, all, european, systems, the, individual, letters, or, symbols, usually, face, in, the, same, direction, as, the, writing, as, a, whole, the, position, or, place, of, inscriptions, depends, greatly, upon, their, purpose, or, intention, when, they, have, a, direct, relation, to, the, sculptures, reliefs, or, paintings, with, which, they, are, associated, they, often, form, a, kind, of, pattern, to, fill, the, background, or, vacant, spaces, between, the, figures, but, sometimes, especially, in, mesopotamian, statues, or, reliefs, they, are, cut, right, across, the, figures, without, any, regard, to, the, artistic, effect, in, late, greek, or, roman, work, it, is, usual, to, cut, any, inscription, relative, to, a, statue, or, relief, upon, the, basis, on, which, this, is, mounted, but, short, inscriptions, such, as, dedications, or, artists, signatures, are, often, placed, in, some, inconspicuous, position, upon, the, work, itself, in, the, case, of, painted, vases, the, inscriptions, relative, to, the, subject, represented, are, usually, painted, but, dedications, and, other, inscriptions, are, often, incised, after, the, vase, has, been, fired, in, egypt, inscriptions, were, often, inscribed, or, painted, upon, inner, walls, of, tombs, whether, they, referred, to, religious, belief, or, ritual, or, to, the, honours, and, possessions, of, the, deceased, they, were, intended, for, his, benefit, and, convenience, rather, than, for, the, information, of, others, so, as, to, perpetuate, his, familiar, surroundings, not, to, make, him, live, in, the, memory, of, his, successors, the, information, which, we, derive, from, such, inscriptions, is, invaluable, to, us, but, such, was, not, the, intention, with, which, they, were, made, on, the, other, hand, inscriptions, which, were, intended, to, be, seen, by, the, public, and, to, perpetuate, a, record, of, events, or, to, supply, useful, information, were, usually, placed, in, places, of, common, resort, above, all, in, temples, and, sacred, precincts, sometimes, they, were, cut, on, convenient, rock, faces, sometimes, upon, the, walls, of, temples, or, other, buildings, most, frequently, the, slabs, of, marble, stelae, stone, metal, or, other, material, upon, which, the, inscriptions, were, incised, were, set, up, in, convenient, positions, to, be, read, in, any, places, of, public, resort, this, was, the, method, of, publication, of, all, laws, decrees, and, official, notices, of, treaties, and, contracts, of, honours, to, officials, or, private, citizens, of, religious, dedications, and, prescriptions, of, ritual, inscribed, tombstones, were, set, up, over, graves, which, were, usually, placed, along, the, chief, roads, leading, out, of, a, town, the, most, familiar, example, being, the, sacred, way, from, athens, to, eleusis, inscriptions, commemorative, of, victories, or, other, great, events, were, only, in, exceptional, cases, erected, upon, the, spot, more, often, such, memorials, were, set, up, in, some, great, religious, centre, such, as, delphi, or, olympia, but, boundary, stones, were, necessarily, placed, on, the, line, which, they, defined, the, study, of, inscriptions, supplies, an, important, contribution, to, the, history, of, many, lands, and, peoples, in, some, cases, as, in, egypt, and, mesopotamia, it, forms, almost, the, only, source, of, information, in, the, absence, of, literary, records, in, others, as, in, greece, and, rome, it, offers, a, most, valuable, supplement, and, comment, to, what, is, otherwise, recorded, both, egyptian, and, mesopotamian, inscriptions, go, back, to, an, extremely, early, date, it, is, at, present, uncertain, which, is, the, earlier, but, both, show, before, 3500, bc, and, possibly, much, earlier, a, complete, organised, system, of, writing, which, implies, many, centuries, of, development, behind, it, the, egyptian, hieroglyphic, system, as, used, in, inscriptions, continued, without, any, essential, change, of, character, until, roman, times, though, various, systems, of, hieratic, modification, were, used, at, different, times, on, the, famous, rosetta, stone, in, the, british, museum, which, first, gave, the, clue, to, the, interpretation, of, egyptian, writing, hieroglyphic, hieratic, and, greek, versions, of, the, same, decree, are, given, side, by, side, its, date, is, 195, bc, the, mesopotamian, linear, symbols, developed, mainly, for, technical, reasons, into, a, wedge, shaped, or, cuneiform, system, which, was, adopted, in, modified, forms, and, applied, to, different, languages, through, some, thousands, of, years, sumerian, babylonian, assyrian, and, persian, until, it, was, superseded, after, the, conquests, of, alexander, by, greek, an, independent, hieroglyphic, system, which, also, developed, into, various, linear, scripts, existed, in, crete, during, the, middle, and, late, minoan, periods, from, about, 3000, probably, to, the, fall, of, knossos, about, 1500, bc, the, hittite, hieroglyphs, correspond, to, the, period, of, the, hittite, empire, in, northern, syria, and, asia, minor, from, about, 2000, to, 800, bc, from, it, according, to, one, theory, arose, the, cypriot, syllabary, which, continued, in, use, until, the, 4th, century, bc, or, later, the, earliest, phoenician, inscriptions, known, date, from, about, the, 10th, century, bc, and, the, alphabet, remained, in, use, down, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, some, believe, this, was, modified, and, adopted, by, the, greeks, at, an, uncertain, date, the, earliest, greek, inscriptions, are, generally, dated, in, the, 7th, century, bc, in, early, times, each, greek, state, had, its, own, alphabet, but, in, the, year, 403, bc, the, archonship, of, eucleides, the, ionian, alphabet, which, is, the, one, used, now, for, greek, capital, letters, was, officially, adopted, by, athens, and, soon, became, universal, in, greece, from, the, various, greek, alphabets, the, different, local, italian, alphabets, including, the, etruscan, were, derived, with, various, modifications, the, roman, alphabet, was, among, these, being, based, on, the, alphabet, of, caere, a, chalcidian, colony, there, are, a, few, very, early, roman, inscriptions, but, they, do, not, become, common, until, the, 3rd, century, bc, from, that, time, the, letters, took, much, the, same, forms, as, they, preserve, to, the, present, day, the, custom, of, putting, inscriptions, in, greek, and, in, latin, on, buildings, and, other, monuments, continued, through, medieval, times, and, is, still, customary, classical, forms, being, frequently, imitated, the, latest, dated, inscription, in, the, greek, corpus, records, the, building, of, a, bridge, in, sicily, in, ad, 1121, the, series, of, byzantine, inscriptions, continues, practically, without, interruption, to, the, present, day, and, latin, retains, its, use, as, a, universal, language, in, religious, public, and, private, inscriptions, it, is, often, possible, to, date, an, inscription, approximately, by, the, style, of, the, lettering, or, even, by, the, alphabet, used, thus, at, athens, the, ionic, alphabet, was, adopted, in, place, of, the, early, attic, alphabet, in, the, archonship, of, eucleides, 403, bc, according, to, a, decree, proposed, by, archinus, but, the, change, was, already, in, process, in, private, inscriptions, and, even, in, official, documents, ionic, forms, are, sometimes, found, earlier, inscriptions, are, dated, in, various, ways, mostly, by, giving, the, name, of, a, king, magistrate, or, priest, in, the, case, of, kings, they, only, give, an, approximate, date, unless, the, year, of, his, reign, is, given, also, but, in, the, case, of, most, independent, cities, the, date, is, given, by, the, name, of, an, annual, magistrate, and, thus, the, year, is, precisely, indicated, at, athens, the, name, used, was, that, of, the, eponymous, archon, and, as, an, almost, complete, list, of, these, has, been, drawn, up, from, inscriptions, and, other, sources, this, means, of, dating, is, quite, satisfactory, the, custom, of, dating, by, olympiads, which, is, familiar, to, us, from, later, greek, and, roman, writers, was, rarely, used, in, early, greece, except, in, connection, with, athletic, victories, many, inscriptions, are, dated, from, various, local, eras, often, based, upon, historical, events, such, as, the, foundation, of, a, town, or, festival, the, organisation, of, a, province, or, even, a, visit, of, an, emperor, the, number, of, these, eras, in, later, times, especially, in, asia, minor, becomes, very, bewildering, in, attic, decrees, and, some, others, it, was, also, usual, to, give, the, day, of, the, month, in, greek, inscription, of, the, roman, period, the, year, of, the, emperor, is, defined, by, the, number, of, his, consulate, or, other, indications, or, titles, as, in, the, corresponding, latin, inscriptions, in, later, times, the, dating, is, commonly, by, indiction, but, as, this, only, gives, the, number, of, the, year, within, the, 15, year, period, but, leaves, that, period, undefined, such, dating, is, very, inconvenient, except, for, merely, temporary, use, in, the, eastern, empire, the, date, from, the, creation, of, the, world, 5509, bc, is, sometimes, given, but, the, date, of, the, christian, era, is, hardly, ever, used, inscriptions, may, be, roughly, divided, into, two, main, classes, those, in, which, the, inscription, was, subservient, to, the, use, or, purpose, of, the, object, on, which, it, was, inscribed, or, at, any, rate, had, a, direct, relation, to, that, object, for, example, the, name, of, the, owner, or, the, record, of, dedication, to, a, god, and, those, in, which, the, inscription, existed, independently, for, its, own, sake, or, for, the, sake, of, the, information, which, it, recorded, and, the, object, on, which, it, was, inscribed, was, either, made, for, the, purpose, as, a, slab, of, marble, or, plate, of, bronze, or, was, made, use, of, as, in, the, case, of, a, convenient, wall, or, the, surface, of, a, rock, or, even, a, potsherd, the, walls, of, buildings, are, often, covered, with, such, inscriptions, especially, if, they, are, in, a, conspicuous, or, convenient, position, and, so, offer, an, obvious, means, of, publicity, for, us, accustomed, as, we, are, to, a, vast, mass, of, books, newspapers, and, other, printed, or, digital, documents, it, is, difficult, to, realise, the, extensive, use, and, great, convenience, assigned, to, inscriptions, in, ancient, times, not, only, were, public, announcements, of, all, sorts, such, as, we, should, make, known, by, advertisements, or, posters, thus, placed, before, the, public, but, all, kinds, of, records, and, enactments, codes, of, law, and, political, decrees, regulations, for, all, matters, civil, and, religious, accounts, and, contracts, public, and, private, treaties, between, states, records, of, public, and, private, benefactions, and, dedications, and, all, matters, of, administration, honours, to, the, living, and, to, the, memory, of, the, dead, many, of, these, were, intended, to, preserve, for, all, time, the, records, which, they, contained, but, others, must, have, been, of, only, temporary, interest, it, seems, therefore, the, more, remarkable, that, they, should, have, been, incised, on, permanent, material, such, as, bronze, marble, or, stone, and, incised, in, the, first, instance, with, a, care, and, perfection, of, technique, which, have, led, to, their, survival, to, the, present, day, so, as, to, preserve, for, us, invaluable, evidence, as, to, the, life, and, institutions, of, the, people, who, made, them, temporary, and, permanent, value, are, therefore, often, combined, in, the, same, inscription, for, instance, any, athenian, citizen, visiting, the, acropolis, or, the, agora, could, satisfy, themselves, at, first, hand, as, to, treaties, or, decrees, of, the, people, public, accounts, or, state, income, and, expenditure, and, at, the, same, time, these, documents, preserved, for, all, time, much, history, both, social, and, political, inscriptions, having, a, direct, relation, to, the, object, or, representation, on, which, they, are, inscribed, vary, greatly, in, their, contents, those, relating, to, picture, or, relief, chronicles, of, the, victories, or, exploits, of, kings, as, in, egypt, and, mesopotamia, serve, as, a, record, of, the, events, and, help, to, interpret, the, scenes, such, inscriptions, are, not, common, in, greek, or, roman, work, but, frequently, especially, in, early, greek, times, and, on, vases, the, names, of, persons, and, even, of, objects, are, written, beside, them, for, the, purpose, of, identification, and, sometimes, a, speech, issues, from, the, mouth, of, the, figure, on, the, carved, wooden, chest, of, cypselus, of, about, 600, bc, hexameter, verses, were, written, curving, about, among, figures, and, giving, a, description, of, each, scene, the, bases, of, statues, and, reliefs, often, had, inscriptions, cut, upon, them, for, identification, and, record, this, was, particularly, the, case, with, honorary, statues, and, tombstones, in, other, cases, where, there, is, an, evident, relation, between, the, artistic, representation, and, the, inscription, the, figures, are, subordinate, and, seem, merely, to, illustrate, the, text, as, when, a, treaty, between, athens, and, samos, has, a, relief, at, its, head, representing, the, goddess, athena, and, hera, clasping, hands, as, representatives, of, their, respective, cities, in, other, cases, the, arms, or, device, of, a, city, is, carved, on, an, inscription, almost, like, a, seal, on, a, document, in, all, these, cases, the, figures, and, the, inscription, are, part, of, a, common, design, whether, carried, out, by, the, same, hand, or, not, but, in, the, case, of, owners, marks, or, names, cut, on, vases, or, other, objects, or, of, the, dedication, of, such, objects, the, inscription, is, not, necessarily, contemporary, it, may, indeed, be, misleading, as, in, the, case, mentioned, with, disapproval, by, cicero, of, using, again, old, greek, statues, and, placing, new, dedicatory, inscriptions, on, them, in, roman, times, a, sort, of, recycling, for, instance, one, of, the, statues, of, athenian, knights, of, the, 5th, century, bc, placed, at, the, entrance, of, the, acropolis, had, a, later, inscription, cut, on, its, base, to, make, it, serve, as, an, equestrian, statue, of, germanicus, probably, in, 18, ad, when, he, visited, athens, in, egypt, and, mesopotamia, also, it, is, not, unusual, to, find, the, name, of, a, later, king, of, official, cut, upon, an, earlier, work, the, majority, of, inscriptions, are, of, independent, value, and, interest, the, object, on, which, they, are, cut, being, either, provided, for, the, purpose, or, utilised, as, convenient, and, suitable, such, inscriptions, may, be, classified, as, religious, and, political, and, social, the, distinction, between, the, two, is, not, always, easy, to, draw, for, in, almost, all, ancient, civilisations, religion, was, a, part, of, the, established, service, of, the, state, and, was, under, public, control, or, at, least, was, closely, bound, up, with, political, administration, it, follows, that, many, inscriptions, relating, to, religious, matters, take, the, form, of, political, decrees, or, state, documents, and, therefore, might, especially, as, far, as, form, is, concerned, be, included, in, either, category, but, it, is, usually, possible, to, classify, them, according, to, their, contents, and, intention, a, temple, was, often, a, kind, of, religious, corporation, under, the, control, of, the, state, and, its, accounts, and, details, of, administration, were, made, public, at, frequent, intervals, usually, annually, by, means, of, inscriptions, exhibited, to, public, view, in, its, precinct, many, such, inscriptions, have, been, found, and, supply, a, great, deal, of, information, that, can, be, obtained, from, no, other, source, some, great, temples, such, as, that, of, apollo, on, the, island, of, delos, held, great, amounts, of, property, both, real, and, portable, the, latter, taking, the, form, either, of, more, or, less, precious, offerings, dedicated, in, the, temple, and, its, surrounding, buildings, or, of, coined, money, the, inscriptions, accordingly, record, gifts, and, acquisitions, of, landed, property, leases, and, assignments, payments, of, rent, and, fines, for, default, loans, and, interest, and, many, other, business, transactions, suitable, to, a, great, landed, proprietor, or, to, a, bank, they, therefore, throw, much, light, upon, the, social, and, economic, conditions, of, ancient, life, such, as, are, nowhere, else, recorded, again, the, lists, of, offerings, dedicated, in, the, temple, and, other, buildings, enable, us, to, realise, almost, visually, the, appearance, of, their, contents, these, are, described, as, being, on, the, floor, on, the, walls, on, shelves, or, in, cases, they, consisted, of, vases, and, other, objects, suitable, for, use, in, the, temple, service, ornaments, and, jewels, statuettes, mostly, in, gold, and, silver, weapons, and, tools, coined, money, and, bullion, mostly, melted, down, from, old, offerings, the, detailed, care, that, was, taken, in, this, last, case, to, ensure, that, the, full, weight, of, these, objects, was, preserved, whether, made, into, a, new, vessel, or, not, is, recorded, in, other, inscriptions, these, elaborate, inventories, were, checked, and, revised, by, each, successive, board, of, administrators, and, gave, the, best, possible, security, against, any, robbery, or, peculation, in, addition, to, such, general, lists, there, are, also, innumerable, records, of, various, gifts, and, acquisitions, whether, of, land, and, houses, or, of, movable, property, of, all, sorts, buildings, and, repairs, are, also, recorded, sometimes, by, the, state, sometimes, by, individuals, whose, piety, and, generosity, are, suitably, honoured, in, form, these, are, often, hardly, to, be, distinguished, from, public, works, of, a, secular, character, which, must, be, mentioned, later, the, inscriptions, on, or, belonging, to, special, dedications, are, often, of, great, historical, interest, there, need, only, be, quoted, the, inscription, on, the, famous, serpent, column, once, at, delphi, and, now, in, the, hippodrome, of, constantinople, with, the, list, of, the, greek, states, which, took, part, in, the, persian, war, and, that, relating, to, the, roman, arms, dedicated, by, pyrrhus, of, epirus, at, dodona, after, his, victories, most, of, the, great, temples, being, of, immemorial, sanctity, it, is, hardly, to, be, expected, that, any, records, of, their, foundation, should, be, found, in, inscriptions, but, on, the, other, hand, we, have, many, accounts, of, the, dedication, of, new, temples, either, by, states, or, communities, or, by, private, individuals, in, almost, all, such, cases, it, was, necessary, to, obtain, sanction, for, the, foundation, from, the, state, thus, the, inscription, often, takes, the, form, of, a, decree, of, the, people, authorising, the, foundation, of, the, temple, and, often, giving, some, privileges, to, the, founder, or, founders, inscriptions, give, much, information, as, to, priests, and, other, religious, officials, there, are, in, the, first, place, lists, of, priests, some, of, them, covering, long, periods, and, even, going, back, to, mythical, times, there, are, also, lists, of, treasures, and, administrators, who, were, usually, lay, officials, appointed, for, the, purpose, either, by, election, or, by, lot, the, duties, and, privileges, of, priests, are, recorded, in, many, inscriptions, and, vary, considerably, from, place, to, place, it, is, recorded, for, instance, what, portions, of, a, victim, at, any, sacrifice, were, to, be, received, by, the, priest, in, any, important, temple, this, must, evidently, have, been, far, more, than, the, priest, or, his, family, could, consume, and, accordingly, it, must, have, been, sold, and, so, constituted, a, considerable, source, of, income, consequently, a, priesthood, was, an, office, well, paid, and, much, sought, after, and, we, actually, find, in, later, greek, times, especially, in, asia, minor, that, priesthoods, were, frequently, sold, under, proper, guarantees, and, with, due, sureties, as, to, the, duties, being, carried, out, sometimes, a, fee, to, the, priest, had, to, be, paid, in, cash, in, some, cases, a, priest, or, priestess, was, allowed, to, take, up, a, collection, on, certain, days, on, the, other, hand, the, duties, of, a, priest, are, often, recorded, he, had, to, see, to, the, cleaning, and, care, of, the, temple, and, its, contents, to, provide, flowers, and, garlands, for, decorations, and, to, supply, the, regular, daily, service, sacrifices, on, great, occasions, were, usually, provided, by, the, state, as, also, were, important, repairs, but, in, some, cases, a, priest, undertook, these, on, his, own, account, and, was, honoured, accordingly, for, instance, by, being, allowed, to, inscribe, his, name, in, the, restored, temple, besides, priests, we, find, many, other, officials, of, various, ranks, attached, to, temples, and, recorded, in, inscriptions, some, of, these, especially, those, who, were, concerned, with, buildings, or, constructions, or, with, the, inventories, of, temple, treasures, and, the, accounts, of, administration, were, lay, officials, appointed, by, the, state, as, in, the, case, of, political, officers, but, many, others, had, specialised, sacerdotal, functions, for, instance, in, many, places, there, were, manteis, or, prophets, often, of, special, families, with, hereditary, skills, in, divination, at, eleusis, we, find, records, of, the, hierophant, the, torch, bearer, and, others, who, took, part, in, the, celebration, of, the, mysteries, at, olympia, in, later, greek, times, we, find, a, remarkable, list, of, officials, that, is, three, priests, three, libation, pourers, two, prophets, three, custodians, of, keys, a, flute, player, an, interpreter, a, priest, for, the, daily, sacrifice, a, secretary, a, wine, pourer, three, dancers, at, libations, a, woodman, to, supply, wood, for, the, sacrifices, and, a, steward, and, cook, the, last, no, sinecure, in, view, of, the, numerous, sacrificial, feasts, there, were, also, many, more, menial, offices, in, the, service, of, temples, which, were, carried, out, by, slaves, such, slaves, were, often, presented, to, the, temple, or, acquired, in, some, other, way, there, is, a, whole, class, of, inscriptions, found, on, many, sites, in, which, the, sale, of, slaves, to, a, temple, or, to, the, god, of, a, temple, is, recorded, it, is, often, difficult, to, know, whether, such, slaves, were, intended, for, the, service, of, a, temple, or, on, the, other, hand, such, service, was, either, purely, formal, or, was, not, required, at, all, the, sale, to, the, temple, being, intended, as, fictitious, so, as, to, enable, a, slave, to, acquire, his, own, freedom, and, at, the, same, time, to, secure, the, protection, of, the, god, in, his, free, status, the, ritual, appropriate, to, different, divinities, and, temples, varied, greatly, from, place, to, place, and, it, was, therefore, necessary, or, desirable, to, set, up, notices, in, all, public, places, of, worship, for, the, information, and, guidance, of, worshippers, the, commonest, and, most, essential, act, of, worship, was, sacrifice, an, example, of, the, simplest, form, of, prescription, is, to, be, seen, in, the, inscription, on, the, relief, from, thasos, in, the, louvre, to, the, nymphs, and, to, apollo, the, leader, of, the, nymphs, the, worshipper, may, if, he, so, choose, sacrifice, a, male, and, a, female, victim, it, is, not, permissible, to, offer, a, sheep, or, a, pig, no, paean, is, sung, to, the, graces, it, is, not, permissible, to, offer, a, goat, or, a, pig, it, is, to, be, noticed, that, this, order, of, service, contains, a, prohibition, as, well, as, a, prescription, such, prohibitions, are, frequent, and, often, relate, to, the, need, of, ceremonial, purity, in, all, worshippers, entering, a, sacred, precinct, they, must, for, a, certain, time, have, abstained, from, certain, prescribed, means, of, pollution, varying, from, place, to, place, the, officials, are, sometimes, ordered, to, erect, notices, giving, information, on, this, point, for, instance, at, the, precinct, of, alectrona, at, ialysus, it, was, prescribed, that, no, horse, ass, mule, nor, any, other, animal, with, a, bushy, tail, should, enter, and, that, nobody, should, bring, such, animals, in, or, wear, shoes, or, any, article, produced, from, pigs, there, is, also, a, fine, for, driving, in, sheep, other, precincts, were, protected, in, a, more, general, manner, from, any, invasion, or, violation, it, was, prohibited, to, cut, wood, or, to, remove, earth, and, stones, or, to, drive, any, beasts, into, some, precincts, the, right, of, erecting, booths, was, either, restricted, or, denied, altogether, sometimes, more, detailed, prescriptions, are, given, for, the, whole, organisation, of, a, festival, thus, at, andania, in, messenia, the, arrangements, for, the, celebration, of, the, local, eleusinia, the, dress, of, the, participants, the, officials, and, policing, are, very, fully, described, similarly, in, the, hall, of, the, iobacchi, at, athens, the, order, of, proceedings, the, officers, and, the, characters, in, the, sacred, play, and, various, administrative, details, are, ordered, when, there, is, any, doubt, about, any, ritual, or, procedure, divination, is, often, resorted, to, and, the, results, of, such, divination, are, recorded, in, inscriptions, as, a, guidance, for, the, future, it, was, also, a, common, practice, to, consult, delphi, or, some, other, oracle, in, doubtful, or, difficult, cases, there, the, exact, method, of, procedure, is, sometimes, recorded, as, well, as, the, response, of, the, oracle, forms, of, worship, are, often, prescribed, or, recorded, especially, hymns, which, are, sometimes, inscribed, together, with, their, musical, notation, the, performance, of, songs, or, hymns, and, dances, are, also, matters, of, constant, reference, especially, in, connection, with, lyrical, or, musical, contests, the, victorious, band, or, performer, often, dedicated, the, prize, in, honour, of, the, god, a, special, form, of, contest, was, that, in, dramatic, performances, of, which, many, records, have, survived, both, from, athens, and, from, many, other, parts, of, the, greek, world, the, regulation, of, athletic, festivals, and, the, records, of, victors, in, their, contests, also, form, a, numerous, class, of, inscriptions, as, regards, mysteries, though, there, are, numerous, regulations, affecting, the, arrangement, of, celebrations, and, the, conduct, of, those, participating, there, is, as, was, to, be, expected, very, little, concerning, the, actual, performances, another, interesting, phase, of, greek, religion, known, to, us, mainly, from, inscriptions, is, offered, by, the, shrines, of, healing, the, most, notable, of, these, is, the, precinct, of, asclepius, at, epidaurus, here, have, been, found, on, large, slabs, of, inscription, compiled, in, all, probability, from, earlier, documents, lists, of, the, cures, effected, by, apollo, and, asclepius, the, cures, are, of, the, most, varied, kinds, from, painful, diseases, or, surgical, cases, to, a, lost, boy, and, a, broken, cup, the, formula, is, in, almost, all, cases, the, same, the, consultant, come, to, epidaurus, sleeps, in, the, abaton, has, dreams, or, sees, visions, and, comes, out, whole, in, later, times, when, such, faith, healing, had, probably, become, less, efficacious, elaborate, prescriptions, of, diet, and, hygiene, are, recorded, a, special, form, of, prayer, consists, of, curses, which, were, often, buried, in, the, ground, probably, with, the, intent, to, reach, the, infernal, gods, such, curses, often, give, the, reason, for, their, being, made, usually, some, injury, done, to, the, author, of, the, curse, sometimes, they, devote, the, offender, to, the, infernal, gods, another, elements, in, greek, religion, which, is, known, to, us, almost, exclusively, by, means, of, inscriptions, is, to, be, found, in, the, religious, associations, that, existed, in, many, greek, cities, apart, from, the, organisation, of, state, religion, though, sometimes, recognised, by, it, these, associations, had, each, its, own, regulations, which, were, duly, recorded, in, inscriptions, they, varied, greatly, both, in, purpose, and, in, character, many, of, them, had, a, definitely, religious, purpose, in, the, worship, of, certain, gods, sometimes, an, alien, community, was, given, special, permission, to, worship, its, own, god, or, gods, in, its, own, way, other, associations, were, more, social, in, character, and, served, as, clubs, or, as, burial, societies, an, interesting, feature, about, such, associations, is, that, the, lists, of, members, of, many, of, them, include, the, names, of, women, and, of, slaves, thus, contrasting, with, the, paternal, basis, of, established, religion, in, greece, ancient, writers, state, that, the, earliest, laws, of, athens, were, inscribed, upon, tablets, of, wood, put, together, in, a, pyramidal, shape, these, owing, to, their, material, have, perished, but, we, have, some, very, early, codes, of, law, preserved, on, stone, notably, at, gortyna, in, crete, here, an, inscription, of, great, length, is, incised, on, the, slabs, of, a, theatre, shaped, structure, in, 12, columns, of, 50, lines, each, it, is, mainly, concerned, with, the, law, of, inheritance, adoption, etc, doubtless, similar, inscriptions, were, set, up, in, many, places, in, greece, an, interesting, series, of, inscriptions, deals, with, the, conditions, under, which, colonists, were, sent, out, from, various, cities, and, the, measures, that, were, taken, to, secure, their, rights, as, citizens, a, bronze, tablet, records, in, some, detail, the, arrangements, of, this, sort, made, when, locrians, established, a, colony, in, naupactus, another, inscription, relates, to, the, athenian, colonisation, of, salamis, in, the, 6th, century, bc, a, very, large, number, of, inscriptions, are, in, the, form, of, decrees, of, various, cities, and, peoples, even, when, their, subject, matter, suggests, that, they, should, be, classified, under, other, headings, almost, all, legislative, and, many, administrative, measures, take, this, form, often, a, decree, prescribes, how, and, where, the, inscription, should, be, set, up, the, formulae, and, preambles, of, such, decrees, vary, considerably, from, place, to, place, and, from, period, to, period, those, of, athens, are, by, far, the, most, exactly, known, owing, to, the, immense, number, that, have, been, discovered, and, they, are, so, strictly, stereotyped, that, can, be, classified, with, the, precision, of, algebraic, formulae, and, often, dated, to, within, a, few, years, by, this, test, alone, very, full, lists, for, this, purpose, have, been, drawn, up, by, epigraphist, wilhelm, larfeld, in, his, work, on, the, subject, it, is, usual, to, record, the, year, by, the, name, of, the, eponymous, archon, the, day, of, the, month, and, of, the, prytany, or, presiding, commission, according, to, tribes, various, secretaries, the, presiding, officials, and, the, proposer, of, the, decree, it, is, also, stated, whether, the, resolution, is, passed, by, the, senate, boule, or, the, assembly, of, the, people, ecclesia, or, both, the, circumstances, or, the, reason, of, the, resolution, are, then, given, and, finally, the, decision, itself, some, other, cities, followed, athens, in, the, form, of, their, decrees, with, such, local, variations, as, were, required, others, were, more, independent, in, their, development, and, different, magistracies, or, forms, of, government, had, various, results, in, the, hellenistic, age, and, later, the, forms, of, independent, government, were, to, a, great, extent, kept, up, though, little, real, power, remained, with, the, people, on, the, other, hand, it, is, common, thing, to, find, letters, from, kings, and, later, from, roman, emperors, inscribed, and, set, up, in, public, places, it, was, customary, to, inscribe, on, stone, all, records, of, the, receipt, custody, and, expenditure, of, public, money, or, treasure, so, that, citizens, could, verify, for, themselves, the, safety, and, due, control, of, the, state, in, all, financial, matters, as, in, the, case, of, temple, accounts, it, was, usual, for, each, temporary, board, of, officials, to, render, to, their, successors, an, account, of, their, stewardship, and, of, the, resources, and, treasures, which, they, handed, over, in, all, cases, of, public, works, the, expenditure, was, ordered, by, the, state, and, detailed, reports, were, drawn, up, and, inscribed, on, stone, at, intervals, while, the, work, was, being, carried, out, in, many, cases, there, is, a, detailed, specification, of, building, work, which, makes, it, possible, not, only, to, realise, all, the, technical, details, and, processes, employed, but, also, the, whole, plan, and, structure, of, a, building, a, notable, instance, is, the, arsenal, of, philon, at, the, peiraeus, which, has, been, completely, reconstructed, on, paper, by, architects, from, the, building, specification, in, the, case, of, the, erechtheum, we, have, not, only, a, detailed, report, on, the, unfinished, state, of, the, building, in, 409, bc, but, also, accounts, of, the, expenditure, and, payments, to, the, workmen, employed, in, finishing, it, similar, accounts, have, been, preserved, of, the, building, of, the, parthenon, spread, over, 15, years, in, the, case, of, both, the, parthenon, and, the, erechtheum, there, are, included, the, payments, made, to, those, who, made, the, sculptures, naval, and, military, expenditure, is, also, fully, accounted, for, among, other, information, there, are, records, of, the, galley, slips, at, the, different, harbours, of, the, piraeus, and, of, the, ships, of, the, athenian, navy, with, their, names, and, condition, in, short, there, is, no, department, of, state, economy, and, financial, administration, that, is, not, abundantly, illustrated, by, the, record, of, inscriptions, a, set, of, records, of, high, historical, value, are, the, tribute, lists, recording, the, quota, paid, to, athens, by, her, subject, allies, during, the, 5th, century, bc, these, throw, much, light, on, her, relations, with, them, at, various, periods, cf, delian, league, an, institution, as, to, which, our, knowledge, is, mainly, derived, from, inscriptions, is, the, ephebic, system, at, athens, there, are, not, only, records, of, lists, of, ephebi, and, of, their, guardians, and, instructors, but, also, decrees, in, honour, of, their, services, especially, in, taking, their, due, part, in, religious, and, other, ceremonies, and, resolutions, of, the, ephebi, themselves, in, honour, of, their, officials, it, is, possible, to, trace, in, the, inscriptions, which, range, over, several, centuries, how, what, was, originally, a, system, of, physical, and, military, training, for, athenian, youths, from, age, of, 18, to, 20, with, outpost, and, police, duties, was, gradually, transformed, in, later, times, there, were, added, to, the, instructors, in, military, exercises, others, who, gave, lectures, on, what, we, should, now, call, arts, and, science, subjects, so, that, in, the, hellenistic, and, roman, times, when, youths, from, all, parts, of, the, civilised, world, flocked, to, athens, as, an, intellectual, centre, the, ephebic, system, became, a, kind, of, cosmopolitan, university, in, addition, to, inscriptions, which, are, concerned, with, the, internal, affairs, of, various, cities, there, are, many, others, recording, treaties, or, other, agreements, of, an, international, character, between, various, cities, and, states, these, were, incised, on, bronze, or, stone, and, set, up, in, places, of, public, resort, in, the, cities, concerned, or, in, common, religious, centres, such, as, olympia, and, delphi, the, simplest, form, of, treaty, is, merely, an, alliance, for, a, certain, term, of, years, usually, with, some, penalty, for, any, breach, of, the, conditions, often, an, oath, was, prescribed, to, be, taken, by, representatives, on, each, side, it, was, also, not, unusual, to, appeal, to, the, god, in, whose, temple, the, treaty, was, exhibited, in, other, cases, a, list, of, gods, by, whom, the, two, parties, must, swear, is, prescribed, commercial, clauses, were, sometimes, added, to, treaties, of, alliance, and, commercial, treaties, are, also, found, agreeing, as, to, the, export, and, import, of, merchandise, and, other, things, in, later, days, especially, in, the, time, of, the, hellenistic, kings, treaties, tend, to, become, more, complicated, and, detailed, in, their, provisions, another, series, of, records, of, great, historical, interest, is, concerned, with, arbitration, between, various, states, on, various, questions, mainly, concerned, with, frontiers, in, cases, of, dispute, it, was, not, uncommon, for, the, two, disputants, to, appoint, a, third, party, as, arbitrator, sometimes, this, third, party, was, another, state, sometimes, a, specified, number, of, individuals, thus, in, a, frontier, dispute, between, corinth, and, epidaurus, 151, citizens, of, megara, were, appointed, by, name, to, arbitrate, and, when, the, decision, was, disputed, 31, from, among, them, revised, and, confirmed, it, in, all, such, cases, it, was, the, custom, for, a, full, record, to, be, preserved, on, stone, and, set, up, in, the, places, concerned, in, this, case, the, initiative, in, referring, the, matter, to, arbitration, came, from, the, achaean, league, a, very, large, class, of, inscriptions, deals, with, the, institution, of, proxenia, according, to, this, a, citizen, of, any, state, might, be, appointed, proxenos, of, another, state, his, duties, would, then, be, to, offer, help, and, hospitality, to, any, citizen, of, that, other, state, who, might, be, visiting, his, city, and, to, assist, him, in, any, dispute, or, in, securing, his, legal, rights, the, office, has, been, compared, to, the, modern, appointment, of, consuls, with, the, essential, difference, that, the, proxenos, is, always, a, citizen, of, the, state, in, which, he, resides, not, of, that, whose, citizens, and, interests, he, assists, the, decrees, upon, this, matter, frequently, record, the, appointment, of, a, proxenos, and, the, conferring, on, him, of, certain, benefits, and, privileges, in, return, for, his, services, they, also, contain, resolutions, of, thanks, from, the, city, served, by, the, proxenos, and, record, honours, consequently, conferred, upon, him, this, class, of, inscription, is, in, form, not, unlike, the, last, except, that, honours, recorded, are, given, for, all, sorts, of, services, private, and, public, to, the, state, and, to, individuals, a, frequent, addition, is, an, invitation, to, dine, in, the, prytaneum, at, athens, some, are, inscribed, on, the, bases, of, statues, set, up, to, the, recipient, in, early, times, these, inscriptions, are, usually, brief, and, simple, the, bust, of, pericles, on, the, acropolis, held, nothing, but, the, names, of, pericles, himself, and, of, the, sculptor, kresilas, later, it, became, usual, to, give, in, some, detail, the, reasons, for, the, honours, awarded, and, in, hellenistic, and, roman, times, these, became, more, and, more, detailed, and, fulsome, in, laudatory, detail, these, inscriptions, are, of, special, interest, as, throwing, much, light, upon, the, history, of, art, the, artist, s, name, was, usually, especially, in, earlier, times, carved, upon, the, base, of, the, pedestal, of, a, statue, and, consequently, was, easily, separated, from, it, if, the, statue, was, carried, off, or, destroyed, a, case, where, both, statue, and, pedestal, are, preserved, is, offered, by, the, victory, signed, on, its, pedestal, by, paeonius, at, olympia, occasionally, and, more, frequently, in, later, times, the, artist, s, signature, was, carved, upon, some, portion, of, the, statue, itself, but, in, later, copies, of, well, known, works, it, has, to, be, considered, whether, the, name, is, that, of, the, original, artist, or, of, the, copyist, who, reproduced, his, work, see, for, example, the, statue, of, hercules, heracles, below, a, special, class, of, artists, signatures, is, offered, by, the, names, signed, by, attic, and, other, vase, painters, upon, their, vases, these, have, been, made, the, basis, of, a, minute, historical, and, stylistic, study, of, the, work, of, these, painters, and, unsigned, vases, also, have, been, grouped, with, the, signed, ones, so, as, to, make, an, exact, and, detailed, record, of, this, branch, of, greek, artistic, production, the, great, majority, of, these, fall, into, one, of, the, classes, already, referred, to, but, there, are, some, instances, in, which, an, inscription, is, set, up, merely, as, a, record, for, instance, a, victor, in, athletic, or, other, contests, may, set, up, a, list, of, his, victories, the, most, famous, historical, record, is, the, autobiographical, account, of, the, deeds, and, administration, of, augustus, which, was, reproduced, and, set, up, in, many, places, it, is, generally, known, as, the, monumentum, ancyranum, because, the, most, complete, copy, of, it, was, found, at, ancyra, the, marmor, parium, at, oxford, found, in, paros, is, a, chronological, record, of, greek, history, probably, made, for, educational, purposes, and, valuable, as, giving, the, traditional, dates, of, events, from, the, earliest, time, down, this, is, by, far, the, most, numerous, class, of, inscriptions, both, greek, and, latin, in, early, times, there, is, often, no, record, beyond, the, name, of, the, deceased, in, athens, often, with, the, name, of, his, father, and, his, deme, sometimes, a, word, or, two, of, conventional, praise, is, added, such, as, a, good, and, wise, man, occasionally, the, circumstances, of, death, are, alluded, to, especially, if, it, took, place, in, battle, or, at, sea, such, epitaphs, were, frequently, in, metrical, form, usually, either, hexameter, or, elegiacs, many, of, them, have, been, collected, and, they, form, an, interesting, addition, to, the, greek, anthology, in, later, times, it, becomes, usual, to, give, more, elaborate, praise, of, the, deceased, but, this, is, hardly, ever, so, detailed, and, fulsome, as, on, more, modern, tombstones, the, age, and, other, facts, about, the, deceased, are, occasionally, given, but, not, nearly, so, often, as, on, latin, tombstones, which, offer, valuable, statistical, information, in, this, respect, latin, inscriptions, may, be, classified, on, much, the, same, lines, as, greek, but, certain, broad, distinctions, may, be, drawn, at, the, outset, they, are, generally, more, standardised, as, to, form, and, as, to, content, not, only, in, rome, and, italy, but, also, throughout, the, provinces, of, the, roman, empire, one, of, the, chief, difficulties, in, deciphering, latin, inscriptions, lies, in, the, very, extensive, use, of, initials, and, abbreviations, these, are, of, great, number, and, variety, and, while, some, of, them, can, be, easily, interpreted, as, belonging, to, well, known, formulae, others, offer, considerable, difficulty, especially, to, the, inexperienced, student, often, the, same, initial, may, have, many, different, meanings, according, to, the, context, some, common, formulae, such, as, v, s, l, m, votum, solvit, libens, merito, or, h, m, h, n, s, hoc, monumentum, heredem, non, sequetur, offer, little, difficulty, but, there, are, many, which, are, not, so, obvious, and, leave, room, for, conjecture, often, the, only, way, to, determine, the, meaning, is, to, search, through, a, list, of, initials, such, as, those, given, by, modern, latin, epigraphists, until, a, formula, is, found, which, fits, the, context, most, of, what, has, been, said, about, greek, inscriptions, applies, to, roman, also, the, commonest, materials, in, this, case, also, are, stone, marble, and, bronze, but, a, more, extensive, use, is, made, of, stamped, bricks, and, tiles, which, are, often, of, historical, value, as, identifying, and, dating, a, building, or, other, construction, the, same, applies, to, leaden, water, pipes, which, frequently, bear, dates, and, names, of, officials, terracotta, lamps, also, frequently, have, their, makers, names, and, other, information, stamped, upon, them, arms, and, especially, shields, sometimes, bear, the, name, and, corps, of, their, owners, leaden, discs, were, also, used, to, serve, the, same, purpose, as, modern, identification, discs, inscriptions, are, also, found, on, sling, bullets, roman, as, well, as, greek, there, are, also, numerous, classes, of, tesserae, or, tickets, of, admission, to, theatres, or, other, shows, as, regards, the, contents, of, inscriptions, there, must, evidently, be, a, considerable, difference, between, records, of, a, number, of, independent, city, states, and, an, empire, including, almost, all, the, civilised, world, but, municipalities, maintained, much, of, their, independent, traditions, in, roman, times, and, consequently, their, inscriptions, often, follow, the, old, formulas, the, classification, of, roman, inscriptions, may, therefore, follow, the, same, lines, as, the, greek, except, that, certain, categories, are, absent, and, that, some, others, not, found, in, greek, are, of, considerable, importance, these, are, very, numerous, and, the, custom, of, placing, the, name, of, the, dedicator, in, a, conspicuous, place, on, the, building, was, prevalent, especially, in, the, case, of, dedications, by, emperors, or, officials, or, by, public, bodies, restoration, or, repair, was, often, recorded, in, the, same, manner, in, the, case, of, small, objects, the, dedication, is, usually, simple, in, form, it, usually, contains, the, name, of, the, god, or, other, recipient, and, of, the, donor, and, a, common, formula, is, d, d, dedit, donavit, often, with, additions, such, as, l, m, libens, merito, such, dedications, are, often, the, result, of, a, vow, and, v, s, votum, solvit, is, therefore, often, added, bequests, made, under, the, wills, of, rich, citizens, are, frequently, recorded, by, inscriptions, these, might, either, be, for, religious, or, for, social, purposes, a, priesthood, was, frequently, a, political, office, and, consequently, is, mentioned, along, with, political, honours, in, the, list, of, a, man, s, distinctions, the, priesthoods, that, a, man, had, held, are, usually, mentioned, first, in, inscriptions, before, his, civil, offices, and, distinctions, religious, offices, as, well, as, civil, were, restricted, to, certain, classes, the, highest, to, those, of, senatorial, rank, the, next, to, those, of, equestrian, status, many, minor, offices, both, in, rome, and, in, the, provinces, are, enumerated, in, their, due, order, among, the, most, interesting, of, these, is, the, ancient, song, and, accompanying, dance, performed, by, the, priests, known, as, the, arval, brothers, this, is, however, not, in, the, form, of, a, ritual, prescription, but, a, detailed, record, of, the, due, performance, of, the, rite, an, important, class, of, documents, is, the, series, of, calendars, that, have, been, found, in, rome, and, in, the, various, italian, towns, these, give, notice, of, religious, festivals, and, anniversaries, and, also, of, the, days, available, for, various, purposes, the, various, colleges, for, religious, purposes, were, very, numerous, many, of, them, both, in, rome, and, italy, and, in, provincial, municipalities, were, of, the, nature, of, priesthoods, some, were, regarded, as, offices, of, high, distinction, and, were, open, only, to, men, of, senatorial, rank, among, these, were, the, augurs, the, fetiales, the, salii, also, the, sodales, divorum, augustorum, in, imperial, times, the, records, of, these, colleges, sometimes, give, no, information, beyond, the, names, of, members, but, these, are, often, of, considerable, interest, haruspices, and, luperci, were, of, equestrian, rank, our, information, as, to, these, is, not, mainly, drawn, from, inscriptions, and, therefore, they, need, not, here, be, considered, on, the, other, hand, the, word, lex, law, is, usually, applied, to, all, decrees, of, the, senate, or, other, bodies, whether, of, legislative, or, of, administrative, character, it, is, therefore, best, to, consider, all, together, under, the, heading, of, public, decrees, a, certain, number, of, these, dating, from, republican, times, are, of, considerable, interest, one, of, the, earliest, relates, to, the, prohibition, of, bacchanalian, orgies, in, italy, it, takes, the, form, of, a, message, from, the, magistrates, stating, the, authority, on, which, they, acted, laws, all, follow, a, fixed, formula, according, to, the, body, which, has, passed, them, first, there, is, a, statement, that, the, legislative, body, was, consulted, by, the, appropriate, magistrate, in, due, form, then, follows, the, text, of, the, law, and, finally, the, sanction, the, statement, that, the, law, was, passed, in, decrees, of, the, senate, the, formula, differs, somewhat, they, begin, with, a, preamble, giving, the, names, of, the, consulting, magistrates, the, place, and, conditions, of, the, meeting, then, comes, the, subject, submitted, for, decision, ending, with, the, formula, qderfp, quid, de, ea, re, fieri, placeret, then, comes, the, decision, of, the, senate, opening, with, deric, de, ea, re, ita, censuerunt, c, is, added, at, the, end, to, indicate, that, the, decree, was, passed, in, imperial, times, the, emperor, sometimes, addressed, a, speech, to, the, senate, advising, them, to, pass, certain, resolutions, or, else, especially, in, later, times, gave, orders, or, instructions, directly, either, on, his, own, initiative, or, in, response, to, questions, or, references, the, number, and, variety, of, such, orders, is, such, that, no, classification, of, them, can, be, given, here, one, of, the, most, famous, is, the, edict, of, diocletian, fixing, the, prices, of, all, commodities, copies, of, this, in, greek, as, well, as, in, latin, have, been, found, in, various, parts, of, the, roman, empire, a, very, large, number, of, inscriptions, record, the, construction, or, repair, of, public, buildings, by, private, individuals, by, magistrates, roman, or, provincial, and, by, emperors, in, addition, to, the, dedication, of, temples, we, find, inscriptions, recording, the, construction, of, aqueducts, roads, especially, on, milestones, baths, basilicas, porticos, and, many, other, works, of, public, utility, in, inscriptions, of, early, period, often, nothing, is, given, but, the, name, of, the, person, who, built, or, restored, the, edifice, and, a, statement, that, he, had, done, so, but, later, it, was, usual, to, give, more, detail, as, to, the, motive, of, the, building, the, name, of, the, emperor, or, a, magistrate, giving, the, date, the, authority, for, the, building, and, the, names, and, distinctions, of, the, builders, then, follows, a, description, of, the, building, the, source, of, the, expenditure, e, g, s, p, sua, pecunia, and, finally, the, appropriate, verb, for, the, work, done, whether, building, restoring, enlarging, or, otherwise, improving, other, details, are, sometimes, added, such, as, the, name, of, the, man, under, whose, direction, the, work, was, done, these, vary, greatly, in, content, and, are, among, the, most, important, documents, concerning, the, administration, of, the, roman, empire, they, are, numerous, and, of, all, sorts, tombstones, of, every, degree, lists, of, soldiers, burial, clubs, certificates, of, discharge, from, service, schedules, of, time, expired, men, dedications, of, altars, records, of, building, or, of, engineering, works, accomplished, the, facts, directly, commemorated, are, rarely, important, but, when, the, information, from, hundreds, of, such, inscriptions, is, collected, together, you, can, trace, the, whole, policy, of, the, imperial, government, in, the, matter, of, recruiting, to, what, extent, and, till, what, date, legionaries, were, raised, in, italy, what, contingents, for, various, branches, of, the, service, were, drawn, from, the, provinces, and, which, provinces, provided, most, how, far, provincials, garrisoned, their, own, countries, and, which, of, them, like, the, british, recruits, were, sent, as, a, measure, of, precaution, to, serve, elsewhere, or, finally, at, what, epoch, the, empire, grew, weak, enough, to, require, the, enlistment, of, barbarians, from, beyond, its, frontiers, there, were, many, treaties, between, rome, and, other, states, in, republican, times, but, we, do, not, as, a, rule, owe, our, knowledge, of, these, to, inscriptions, which, are, very, rare, in, this, earlier, period, in, imperial, times, to, which, most, latin, inscriptions, belong, international, relations, were, subject, to, the, universal, domination, of, rome, and, consequently, the, documents, relating, to, them, are, concerned, with, reference, to, the, central, authority, and, often, take, the, form, of, orders, from, the, emperor, this, custom, belonged, to, greece, what, most, nearly, corresponded, to, it, in, roman, times, was, the, adoption, of, some, distinguished, roman, as, its, patron, by, a, city, or, state, the, relation, was, then, recorded, usually, on, a, bronze, tablet, placed, in, some, conspicuous, position, in, the, town, concerned, the, patron, probably, also, kept, a, copy, in, his, house, or, had, a, portable, tablet, which, would, ensure, his, recognition, and, reception, honorary, inscriptions, are, extremely, common, in, all, parts, of, the, roman, world, sometimes, they, are, placed, on, the, bases, of, statues, sometimes, in, documents, set, up, to, record, some, particular, benefaction, or, the, construction, of, some, public, work, the, offices, held, by, the, person, commemorated, and, the, distinctions, conferred, upon, him, are, enumerated, in, a, regularly, established, order, cursus, honorum, either, beginning, with, the, lower, and, proceeding, step, by, step, to, the, higher, or, in, reverse, order, with, the, highest, first, religious, and, priestly, offices, are, usually, mentioned, before, civil, and, political, ones, these, might, be, exercised, either, in, rome, itself, or, in, the, various, municipalities, of, the, empire, there, was, also, a, distinction, drawn, between, offices, that, might, be, held, only, by, persons, of, senatorial, rank, those, that, were, assigned, to, persons, of, equestrian, rank, and, those, of, a, less, distinguished, kind, it, follows, that, when, only, a, portion, of, an, inscription, has, been, found, it, is, often, possible, to, restore, the, whole, in, accordance, with, the, accepted, order, when, these, are, attached, to, statues, it, is, sometimes, doubtful, whether, the, name, is, that, of, the, man, who, actually, made, the, statue, or, of, the, master, whose, work, it, reproduces, thus, there, are, two, well, known, copies, of, a, statue, of, hercules, by, lysippus, of, which, one, is, said, to, be, the, work, of, lysippus, and, the, other, states, that, it, was, made, by, glycon, see, images, another, kind, of, artist, s, or, artificer, s, signature, that, is, commoner, in, roman, times, is, to, be, found, in, the, signatures, of, potters, upon, lamps, and, various, kinds, of, vessels, they, are, usually, impressed, on, the, mould, and, stand, out, in, relief, on, the, terracotta, or, other, material, these, are, of, interest, as, giving, much, information, as, to, the, commercial, spread, of, various, kinds, of, handicrafts, and, also, as, to, the, conditions, under, which, they, were, manufactured, many, of, these, inscriptions, might, well, be, assigned, to, one, of, the, categories, already, considered, but, there, are, some, which, were, expressly, made, to, commemorate, an, important, event, or, to, preserve, a, record, among, the, most, interesting, is, the, inscription, of, the, columna, rostrata, in, rome, which, records, the, great, naval, victory, of, gaius, duilius, over, the, carthaginians, this, however, is, not, the, original, but, a, later, and, somewhat, modified, version, a, document, of, high, importance, is, a, summary, of, the, life, and, achievements, of, augustus, already, mentioned, and, known, as, the, monumentum, ancyranum, the, various, sets, of, fasti, constituted, a, record, of, the, names, of, consuls, and, other, magistrates, or, high, officials, and, also, of, the, triumphs, accorded, to, conquering, generals, these, are, probably, the, most, numerous, of, all, classes, of, inscriptions, and, though, many, of, them, are, of, no, great, individual, interest, they, convey, when, taken, collectively, much, valuable, information, as, to, the, distribution, and, transference, of, population, as, to, trades, and, professions, as, to, health, and, longevity, and, as, to, many, other, conditions, of, ancient, life, the, most, interesting, early, series, is, that, on, the, tombs, of, the, scipios, at, rome, recording, mostly, in, saturnian, metre, the, exploits, and, distinctions, of, the, various, members, of, that, family, about, the, end, of, the, republic, and, the, beginning, of, the, empire, it, became, customary, to, head, a, tombstone, with, the, letters, d, m, or, d, m, s, dis, manibus, sacrum, thus, consecrating, the, tomb, to, the, deceased, as, having, become, members, of, the, body, of, ghosts, or, spirits, of, the, dead, these, are, followed, by, the, name, of, the, deceased, usually, with, his, father, s, name, and, his, tribe, by, his, honours, and, distinctions, sometimes, by, a, record, of, his, age, the, inscription, often, concludes, with, h, i, hic, iacet, or, some, similar, formula, and, also, frequently, with, a, statement, of, boundaries, and, a, prohibition, of, violation, or, further, use, for, instance, h, m, h, n, s, hoc, monumentum, heredem, non, sequetur, this, monument, is, not, to, pass, to, the, heir, the, person, who, has, erected, the, monument, and, his, relation, to, the, deceased, are, often, stated, or, if, a, man, has, prepared, the, tomb, in, his, lifetime, this, also, may, be, stated, v, s, f, vivus, sibi, fecit, but, there, is, an, immense, variety, in, the, information, that, either, a, man, himself, or, his, friend, may, wish, to, record, milliarium, milestones, have, already, been, referred, to, and, may, be, regarded, as, records, of, the, building, of, roads, boundary, stones, termini, are, frequently, found, both, of, public, and, private, property, a, well, known, instance, is, offered, by, those, set, up, by, the, commissioners, called, iii, viri, a, i, a, agris, iudicandis, adsignandis, in, the, time, of, the, gracchi
