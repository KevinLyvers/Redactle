the, 1556, shaanxi, earthquake, postal, romanization, shensi, known, in, chinese, colloquially, by, its, regnal, year, as, the, jiajing, great, earthquake, ji, j, ng, d, d, zh, n, or, officially, by, its, epicenter, as, the, hua, county, earthquake, hu, xi, n, d, zh, n, occurred, in, the, early, morning, of, 2, february, 1556, in, huaxian, shaanxi, during, the, ming, dynasty, most, of, the, residents, there, lived, in, yaodongs, artificial, caves, in, loess, cliffs, which, collapsed, and, buried, alive, those, sleeping, inside, modern, estimates, put, the, direct, deaths, from, the, earthquake, at, over, 100, 000, while, over, 700, 000, migrated, away, or, died, from, famine, and, plagues, which, summed, up, to, a, total, loss, of, 830, 000, people, in, imperial, records, it, was, the, deadliest, recorded, earthquake, in, history, and, in, turn, one, of, the, deadliest, natural, disasters, in, chinese, history, huaxian, lies, within, the, weihe, basin, one, of, the, rift, basins, that, form, the, southern, and, eastern, boundaries, of, the, ordos, block, to, the, east, the, basin, is, continuous, with, the, shanxi, rift, system, the, weihe, basin, formed, during, the, paleogene, in, response, to, northwest, southeast, directed, extension, following, a, tectonically, quiet, period, during, the, late, paleogene, the, rift, basins, became, active, again, in, the, neogene, in, response, to, nnw, sse, directed, extension, activity, that, continues, to, the, present, the, basins, in, the, weihe, shanxi, rift, system, are, bounded, by, large, normal, faults, which, have, been, responsible, for, large, historical, earthquakes, the, weihe, basin, has, an, overall, half, graben, geometry, with, the, main, controlling, faults, such, as, the, huashan, fault, and, north, qinling, fault, forming, the, southern, boundary, the, epicenter, was, in, the, wei, river, valley, in, shaanxi, province, near, huaxian, now, huazhou, district, of, weinan, weinan, and, huayin, huaxian, was, completely, destroyed, killing, more, than, half, the, residents, of, the, city, with, an, estimated, death, toll, in, the, hundreds, of, thousands, the, situation, in, weinan, and, huayin, was, similar, in, certain, areas, 20, metre, deep, 66, ft, crevices, opened, in, the, earth, destruction, and, death, were, widespread, affecting, places, as, far, as, 500, kilometres, 310, mi, from, the, epicenter, the, earthquake, also, triggered, landslides, which, contributed, to, the, massive, death, toll, the, rupture, occurred, during, the, reign, of, the, jiajing, emperor, of, the, ming, dynasty, therefore, in, the, chinese, historical, record, this, earthquake, is, often, referred, to, as, the, jiajing, great, earthquake, in, the, annals, of, china, it, was, described, in, this, manner, in, the, winter, of, 1556, an, earthquake, catastrophe, occurred, in, the, shaanxi, and, shanxi, provinces, in, our, hua, county, various, misfortunes, took, place, mountains, and, rivers, changed, places, and, roads, were, destroyed, in, some, places, the, ground, suddenly, rose, up, and, formed, new, hills, or, it, sank, abruptly, and, became, new, valleys, in, other, areas, a, stream, burst, out, in, an, instant, or, the, ground, broke, and, new, gullies, appeared, huts, official, houses, temples, and, city, walls, collapsed, all, of, a, sudden, the, earthquake, damaged, many, of, the, forest, of, stone, steles, badly, of, the, 114, kaicheng, stone, classics, 40, were, broken, in, the, earthquake, the, scholar, qin, keda, lived, through, the, earthquake, and, recorded, details, one, conclusion, he, drew, was, that, at, the, very, beginning, of, an, earthquake, people, indoors, should, not, go, out, immediately, just, crouch, down, and, wait, even, if, the, nest, has, collapsed, some, eggs, may, remain, intact, the, shaking, reduced, the, height, of, the, small, wild, goose, pagoda, in, xi, an, by, three, levels, modern, estimates, based, on, geological, data, give, the, earthquake, a, magnitude, of, approximately, 8, m, w, on, the, moment, magnitude, scale, and, xi, catastrophic, damage, on, the, mercalli, scale, though, more, recent, discoveries, have, shown, that, it, was, more, likely, 7, 9, m, w, while, it, was, the, deadliest, earthquake, and, the, third, deadliest, natural, disaster, in, history, there, have, been, earthquakes, with, considerably, higher, magnitudes, following, the, earthquake, aftershocks, continued, several, times, a, month, for, half, a, year, shaking, was, felt, strongly, across, the, weihe, basin, region, the, maximum, china, seismic, intensity, was, xi, to, xii, occurring, in, huaxian, and, weinan, this, would, support, the, theory, of, the, earthquake, rupturing, along, the, huashan, and, weinan, faults, intensity, viii, was, observed, throughout, the, basin, and, the, intensity, x, zone, was, 100, km, 62, mi, long, studies, about, the, earthquake, published, between, 1998, and, 2017, presumed, scarps, along, the, huashan, and, weinan, faults, some, higher, than, 8, m, 26, ft, were, produced, by, the, 1556, earthquake, the, fault, zone, is, located, northeast, of, xi, an, this, normal, fault, generally, trends, east, west, and, dips, to, the, north, a, 1995, study, said, scarps, along, the, huashan, fault, were, 3, 8, m, 9, 8, 26, 2, ft, high, near, the, town, of, huashan, the, fault, terrace, contained, yangshao, culture, artefacts, which, were, 4, 000, years, old, in, a, separate, 1998, study, the, fault, scarps, were, about, 4, 7, m, 13, 23, ft, high, scarps, of, the, weinan, fault, are, less, detailed, in, published, works, with, most, focused, around, the, chishui, river, area, two, studies, in, 1992, and, 2010, estimated, the, fault, scarps, at, 2, 4, m, 6, ft, 7, in, 13, ft, 1, in, and, 7, 8, m, 23, 26, ft, respectively, there, has, not, been, any, research, to, confirm, these, scarps, were, produced, by, the, earthquake, or, formed, by, multiple, events, assuming, both, faults, ruptured, during, the, earthquake, which, runs, for, a, total, 90, km, 56, mi, the, m, w, would, be, 7, 0, 7, 5, according, to, empirical, scaling, relationships, between, magnitude, and, fault, rupture, length, this, suggest, previous, values, for, the, earthquake, s, magnitude, were, overestimated, more, than, 97, counties, in, the, provinces, of, shaanxi, shanxi, henan, gansu, hebei, shandong, hubei, hunan, jiangsu, and, anhui, were, affected, buildings, were, damaged, slightly, in, the, cities, of, beijing, chengdu, and, shanghai, an, 840, kilometre, wide, 520, mi, area, was, destroyed, and, in, some, counties, as, much, as, 60, of, the, population, was, killed, the, cost, of, damage, done, by, the, earthquake, is, almost, impossible, to, measure, in, modern, terms, modern, estimates, put, the, direct, deaths, from, the, earthquake, to, be, probably, a, little, over, 100, 000, while, 730, 000, migrated, away, or, died, from, famine, and, plagues, which, summed, up, to, a, total, loss, of, 830, 000, people, in, imperial, records, it, is, one, of, the, deadliest, earthquakes, in, china, in, turn, making, it, one, of, the, top, disasters, in, china, by, death, toll, millions, of, people, at, the, time, lived, in, yaodong, artificial, loess, caves, on, high, cliffs, in, the, loess, plateau, much, of, the, population, in, some, of, the, affected, areas, lived, in, yaodongs, this, was, a, major, contributing, factor, to, the, very, high, death, toll, the, earthquake, collapsed, many, caves, and, caused, landslides, which, destroyed, many, more, the, portuguese, dominican, friar, gaspar, da, cruz, who, visited, guangzhou, later, in, 1556, heard, about, the, earthquake, and, later, reported, about, it, in, the, last, chapter, of, his, book, a, treatise, of, china, 1569, he, viewed, the, earthquake, as, a, possible, punishment, for, people, s, sins, and, the, great, comet, of, 1556, as, possibly, the, sign, of, this, calamity, as, well, as, perhaps, the, sign, of, the, birth, of, the, antichrist
