discrimination, and, disenfranchisement, in, the, country, the, movement, had, its, origins, in, the, reconstruction, era, during, the, late, 19th, century, and, had, its, modern, roots, in, the, 1940s, after, years, of, direct, actions, and, grassroots, protests, the, movement, made, its, largest, legislative, gains, in, the, 1960s, the, social, movement, s, major, nonviolent, resistance, and, civil, disobedience, campaigns, eventually, secured, new, protections, in, federal, law, for, the, civil, rights, of, all, americans, the, social, movement, s, span, of, time, is, called, the, civil, rights, era, after, the, american, civil, war, and, the, subsequent, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, 1860s, the, reconstruction, amendments, to, the, united, states, constitution, granted, emancipation, and, constitutional, rights, of, citizenship, to, all, african, americans, most, of, whom, had, recently, been, enslaved, for, a, short, period, of, time, african, american, men, voted, and, held, political, office, but, as, time, went, on, blacks, were, increasingly, deprived, of, civil, rights, often, under, the, racist, jim, crow, laws, and, african, americans, were, subjected, to, discrimination, and, sustained, violence, by, white, supremacists, in, the, south, over, the, following, century, various, efforts, were, made, by, african, americans, to, secure, their, legal, and, civil, rights, such, as, the, civil, rights, movements, of, 1865, 1896, and, 1896, 1954, the, movement, was, characterized, by, nonviolent, mass, protests, and, civil, disobedience, following, highly, publicized, events, such, as, the, lynching, of, emmett, till, these, included, boycotts, such, as, the, montgomery, bus, boycott, sit, ins, in, greensboro, and, nashville, a, series, of, protests, during, the, birmingham, campaign, and, a, march, from, selma, to, montgomery, at, the, culmination, of, a, legal, strategy, pursued, by, african, americans, in, 1954, the, supreme, court, struck, down, the, underpinnings, of, laws, that, had, allowed, racial, segregation, and, discrimination, to, be, legal, in, the, united, states, as, unconstitutional, the, warren, court, made, a, series, of, landmark, rulings, against, racist, discrimination, including, the, separate, but, equal, doctrine, such, as, brown, v, board, of, education, 1954, heart, of, atlanta, motel, inc, v, united, states, 1964, and, loving, v, virginia, 1967, which, banned, segregation, in, public, schools, and, public, accommodations, and, struck, down, all, state, laws, banning, interracial, marriage, the, rulings, played, a, crucial, role, in, bringing, an, end, to, the, segregationist, jim, crow, laws, prevalent, in, the, southern, states, in, the, 1960s, moderates, in, the, movement, worked, with, the, united, states, congress, to, achieve, the, passage, of, several, significant, pieces, of, federal, legislation, that, authorized, oversight, and, enforcement, of, civil, rights, laws, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, explicitly, banned, all, discrimination, based, on, race, including, racial, segregation, in, schools, businesses, and, in, public, accommodations, the, voting, rights, act, of, 1965, restored, and, protected, voting, rights, by, authorizing, federal, oversight, of, registration, and, elections, in, areas, with, historic, under, representation, of, minority, voters, the, fair, housing, act, of, 1968, banned, discrimination, in, the, sale, or, rental, of, housing, african, americans, re, entered, politics, in, the, south, and, young, people, across, the, country, began, to, take, action, from, 1964, through, 1970, a, wave, of, riots, and, protests, in, black, communities, dampened, support, from, the, white, middle, class, but, increased, support, from, private, foundations, the, emergence, of, the, black, power, movement, which, lasted, from, 1965, to, 1975, challenged, black, leaders, of, the, movement, for, its, cooperative, attitude, and, its, adherence, to, legalism, and, nonviolence, its, leaders, demanded, not, only, legal, equality, but, also, economic, self, sufficiency, for, the, community, support, for, the, black, power, movement, came, from, african, americans, who, had, seen, little, material, improvement, since, the, civil, rights, movement, s, peak, in, the, mid, 1960s, and, still, faced, discrimination, in, jobs, housing, education, and, politics, many, popular, representations, of, the, civil, rights, movement, are, centered, on, the, charismatic, leadership, and, philosophy, of, martin, luther, king, jr, who, won, the, 1964, nobel, peace, prize, for, combatting, racial, inequality, through, nonviolent, resistance, however, some, scholars, note, that, the, movement, was, too, diverse, to, be, credited, to, any, particular, person, organization, or, strategy, before, the, american, civil, war, eight, serving, presidents, had, owned, slaves, almost, four, million, black, people, remained, enslaved, in, the, south, generally, only, white, men, with, property, could, vote, and, the, naturalization, act, of, 1790, limited, u, s, citizenship, to, whites, following, the, civil, war, three, constitutional, amendments, were, passed, including, the, 13th, amendment, 1865, that, ended, slavery, the, 14th, amendment, 1869, that, gave, black, people, citizenship, adding, their, total, for, congressional, apportionment, and, the, 15th, amendment, 1870, that, gave, black, males, the, right, to, vote, only, males, could, vote, in, the, u, s, at, the, time, from, 1865, to, 1877, the, united, states, underwent, a, turbulent, reconstruction, era, during, which, the, federal, government, tried, to, establish, free, labor, and, the, civil, rights, of, freedmen, in, the, south, after, the, end, of, slavery, many, whites, resisted, the, social, changes, leading, to, the, formation, of, insurgent, movements, such, as, the, ku, klux, klan, kkk, whose, members, attacked, black, and, white, republicans, in, order, to, maintain, white, supremacy, in, 1871, president, ulysses, s, grant, the, u, s, army, and, u, s, attorney, general, amos, t, akerman, initiated, a, campaign, to, repress, the, kkk, under, the, enforcement, acts, some, states, were, reluctant, to, enforce, the, federal, measures, of, the, act, in, addition, by, the, early, 1870s, other, white, supremacist, and, insurgent, paramilitary, groups, arose, that, violently, opposed, african, american, legal, equality, and, suffrage, intimidating, and, suppressing, black, voters, and, assassinating, republican, officeholders, however, if, the, states, failed, to, implement, the, acts, the, laws, allowed, the, federal, government, to, get, involved, many, republican, governors, were, afraid, of, sending, black, militia, troops, to, fight, the, klan, for, fear, of, war, after, the, disputed, election, of, 1876, which, resulted, in, the, end, of, reconstruction, and, the, withdrawal, of, federal, troops, whites, in, the, south, regained, political, control, of, the, region, s, state, legislatures, they, continued, to, intimidate, and, violently, attack, blacks, before, and, during, elections, to, suppress, their, voting, but, the, last, african, americans, were, elected, to, congress, from, the, south, before, disenfranchisement, of, blacks, by, states, throughout, the, region, as, described, below, from, 1890, to, 1908, southern, states, passed, new, constitutions, and, laws, to, disenfranchise, african, americans, and, many, poor, whites, by, creating, barriers, to, voter, registration, voting, rolls, were, dramatically, reduced, as, blacks, and, poor, whites, were, forced, out, of, electoral, politics, after, the, landmark, supreme, court, case, of, smith, v, allwright, 1944, which, prohibited, white, primaries, progress, was, made, in, increasing, black, political, participation, in, the, rim, south, and, acadiana, although, almost, entirely, in, urban, areas, and, a, few, rural, localities, where, most, blacks, worked, outside, plantations, the, status, quo, ante, of, excluding, african, americans, from, the, political, system, lasted, in, the, remainder, of, the, south, especially, north, louisiana, mississippi, and, alabama, until, national, civil, rights, legislation, was, passed, in, the, mid, 1960s, to, provide, federal, enforcement, of, constitutional, voting, rights, for, more, than, sixty, years, blacks, in, the, south, were, essentially, excluded, from, politics, unable, to, elect, anyone, to, represent, their, interests, in, congress, or, local, government, since, they, could, not, vote, they, could, not, serve, on, local, juries, during, this, period, the, white, dominated, democratic, party, maintained, political, control, of, the, south, with, whites, controlling, all, the, seats, representing, the, total, population, of, the, south, they, had, a, powerful, voting, bloc, in, congress, the, republican, party, the, party, of, lincoln, and, the, party, to, which, most, blacks, had, belonged, shrank, to, insignificance, except, in, remote, unionist, areas, of, appalachia, and, the, ozarks, as, black, voter, registration, was, suppressed, the, republican, lily, white, movement, also, gained, strength, by, excluding, blacks, until, 1965, the, solid, south, was, a, one, party, system, under, the, white, democrats, excepting, the, previously, noted, historic, unionist, strongholds, the, democratic, party, nomination, was, tantamount, to, election, for, state, and, local, office, in, 1901, president, theodore, roosevelt, invited, booker, t, washington, president, of, the, tuskegee, institute, to, dine, at, the, white, house, making, him, the, first, african, american, to, attend, an, official, dinner, there, the, invitation, was, roundly, criticized, by, southern, politicians, and, newspapers, washington, persuaded, the, president, to, appoint, more, blacks, to, federal, posts, in, the, south, and, to, try, to, boost, african, american, leadership, in, state, republican, organizations, however, these, actions, were, resisted, by, both, white, democrats, and, white, republicans, as, an, unwanted, federal, intrusion, into, state, politics, during, the, same, time, as, african, americans, were, being, disenfranchised, white, southerners, imposed, racial, segregation, by, law, violence, against, blacks, increased, with, numerous, lynchings, through, the, turn, of, the, century, the, system, of, de, jure, state, sanctioned, racial, discrimination, and, oppression, that, emerged, from, the, post, reconstruction, south, became, known, as, the, jim, crow, system, the, united, states, supreme, court, made, up, almost, entirely, of, northerners, upheld, the, constitutionality, of, those, state, laws, that, required, racial, segregation, in, public, facilities, in, its, 1896, decision, plessy, v, ferguson, legitimizing, them, through, the, separate, but, equal, doctrine, segregation, which, began, with, slavery, continued, with, jim, crow, laws, with, signs, used, to, show, blacks, where, they, could, legally, walk, talk, drink, rest, or, eat, for, those, places, that, were, racially, mixed, non, whites, had, to, wait, until, all, white, customers, were, served, first, elected, in, 1912, president, woodrow, wilson, gave, in, to, demands, by, southern, members, of, his, cabinet, and, ordered, segregation, of, workplaces, throughout, the, federal, government, the, early, 20th, century, is, a, period, often, referred, to, as, the, nadir, of, american, race, relations, when, the, number, of, lynchings, was, highest, while, tensions, and, civil, rights, violations, were, most, intense, in, the, south, social, discrimination, affected, african, americans, in, other, regions, as, well, at, the, national, level, the, southern, bloc, controlled, important, committees, in, congress, defeated, passage, of, federal, laws, against, lynching, and, exercised, considerable, power, beyond, the, number, of, whites, in, the, south, characteristics, of, the, post, reconstruction, period, african, americans, and, other, ethnic, minorities, rejected, this, regime, they, resisted, it, in, numerous, ways, and, sought, better, opportunities, through, lawsuits, new, organizations, political, redress, and, labor, organizing, see, the, civil, rights, movement, 1896, 1954, the, national, association, for, the, advancement, of, colored, people, naacp, was, founded, in, 1909, it, fought, to, end, race, discrimination, through, litigation, education, and, lobbying, efforts, its, crowning, achievement, was, its, legal, victory, in, the, supreme, court, decision, brown, v, board, of, education, 1954, when, the, warren, court, ruled, that, segregation, of, public, schools, in, the, us, was, unconstitutional, and, by, implication, overturned, the, separate, but, equal, doctrine, established, in, plessy, v, ferguson, of, 1896, following, the, unanimous, supreme, court, ruling, many, states, began, to, gradually, integrate, their, schools, but, some, areas, of, the, south, resisted, by, closing, public, schools, altogether, the, integration, of, southern, public, libraries, followed, demonstrations, and, protests, that, used, techniques, seen, in, other, elements, of, the, larger, civil, rights, movement, this, included, sit, ins, beatings, and, white, resistance, for, example, in, 1963, in, the, city, of, anniston, alabama, two, black, ministers, were, brutally, beaten, for, attempting, to, integrate, the, public, library, though, there, was, resistance, and, violence, the, integration, of, libraries, was, generally, quicker, than, the, integration, of, other, public, institutions, the, situation, for, blacks, outside, the, south, was, somewhat, better, in, most, states, they, could, vote, and, have, their, children, educated, though, they, still, faced, discrimination, in, housing, and, jobs, in, 1900, reverend, matthew, anderson, speaking, at, the, annual, hampton, negro, conference, in, virginia, said, that, the, lines, along, most, of, the, avenues, of, wage, earning, are, more, rigidly, drawn, in, the, north, than, in, the, south, there, seems, to, be, an, apparent, effort, throughout, the, north, especially, in, the, cities, to, debar, the, colored, worker, from, all, the, avenues, of, higher, remunerative, labor, which, makes, it, more, difficult, to, improve, his, economic, condition, even, than, in, the, south, from, 1910, to, 1970, blacks, sought, better, lives, by, migrating, north, and, west, out, of, the, south, a, total, of, nearly, seven, million, blacks, left, the, south, in, what, was, known, as, the, great, migration, most, during, and, after, world, war, ii, so, many, people, migrated, that, the, demographics, of, some, previously, black, majority, states, changed, to, a, white, majority, in, combination, with, other, developments, the, rapid, influx, of, blacks, altered, the, demographics, of, northern, and, western, cities, happening, at, a, period, of, expanded, european, hispanic, and, asian, immigration, it, added, to, social, competition, and, tensions, with, the, new, migrants, and, immigrants, battling, for, a, place, in, jobs, and, housing, reflecting, social, tensions, after, world, war, i, as, veterans, struggled, to, return, to, the, workforce, and, labor, unions, were, organizing, the, red, summer, of, 1919, was, marked, by, hundreds, of, deaths, and, higher, casualties, across, the, u, s, as, a, result, of, white, race, riots, against, blacks, that, took, place, in, more, than, three, dozen, cities, such, as, the, chicago, race, riot, of, 1919, and, the, omaha, race, riot, of, 1919, urban, problems, such, as, crime, and, disease, were, blamed, on, the, large, influx, of, southern, blacks, to, cities, in, the, north, and, west, based, on, stereotypes, of, rural, southern, african, americans, overall, blacks, in, northern, and, western, cities, experienced, systemic, discrimination, in, a, plethora, of, aspects, of, life, within, employment, economic, opportunities, for, blacks, were, routed, to, the, lowest, status, and, restrictive, in, potential, mobility, within, the, housing, market, stronger, discriminatory, measures, were, used, in, correlation, to, the, influx, resulting, in, a, mix, of, targeted, violence, restrictive, covenants, redlining, and, racial, steering, the, great, migration, resulted, in, many, african, americans, becoming, urbanized, and, they, began, to, realign, from, the, republican, to, the, democratic, party, especially, because, of, opportunities, under, the, new, deal, of, the, franklin, d, roosevelt, administration, during, the, great, depression, in, the, 1930s, substantially, under, pressure, from, african, american, supporters, who, began, the, march, on, washington, movement, president, roosevelt, issued, the, first, federal, order, banning, discrimination, and, created, the, fair, employment, practice, committee, after, both, world, wars, black, veterans, of, the, military, pressed, for, full, civil, rights, and, often, led, activist, movements, in, 1948, president, harry, truman, issued, executive, order, 9981, which, ended, segregation, in, the, military, housing, segregation, became, a, nationwide, problem, following, the, great, migration, of, black, people, out, of, the, south, racial, covenants, were, employed, by, many, real, estate, developers, to, protect, entire, subdivisions, with, the, primary, intent, to, keep, white, neighborhoods, white, ninety, percent, of, the, housing, projects, built, in, the, years, following, world, war, ii, were, racially, restricted, by, such, covenants, cities, known, for, their, widespread, use, of, racial, covenants, include, chicago, baltimore, detroit, milwaukee, los, angeles, seattle, and, st, louis, said, premises, shall, not, be, rented, leased, or, conveyed, to, or, occupied, by, any, person, other, than, of, the, white, or, caucasian, race, while, many, whites, defended, their, space, with, violence, intimidation, or, legal, tactics, toward, black, people, many, other, whites, migrated, to, more, racially, homogeneous, suburban, or, exurban, regions, a, process, known, as, white, flight, from, the, 1930s, to, the, 1960s, the, national, association, of, real, estate, boards, nareb, issued, guidelines, that, specified, that, a, realtor, should, never, be, instrumental, in, introducing, to, a, neighborhood, a, character, or, property, or, occupancy, members, of, any, race, or, nationality, or, any, individual, whose, presence, will, be, clearly, detrimental, to, property, values, in, a, neighborhood, the, result, was, the, development, of, all, black, ghettos, in, the, north, and, west, where, much, housing, was, older, as, well, as, south, the, first, anti, miscegenation, law, was, passed, by, the, maryland, general, assembly, in, 1691, criminalizing, interracial, marriage, in, a, speech, in, charleston, illinois, in, 1858, abraham, lincoln, stated, i, am, not, nor, ever, have, been, in, favor, of, making, voters, or, jurors, of, negroes, nor, of, qualifying, them, to, hold, office, nor, to, intermarry, with, white, people, by, the, late, 1800s, 38, us, states, had, anti, miscegenation, statutes, by, 1924, the, ban, on, interracial, marriage, was, still, in, force, in, 29, states, while, interracial, marriage, had, been, legal, in, california, since, 1948, in, 1957, actor, sammy, davis, jr, faced, a, backlash, for, his, involvement, with, white, actress, kim, novak, davis, briefly, married, a, black, dancer, in, 1958, to, protect, himself, from, mob, violence, in, 1958, officers, in, virginia, entered, the, home, of, mildred, and, richard, loving, and, dragged, them, out, of, bed, for, living, together, as, an, interracial, couple, on, the, basis, that, any, white, person, intermarry, with, a, colored, person, or, vice, versa, each, party, shall, be, guilty, of, a, felony, and, face, prison, terms, of, five, years, invigorated, by, the, victory, of, brown, and, frustrated, by, the, lack, of, immediate, practical, effect, private, citizens, increasingly, rejected, gradualist, legalistic, approaches, as, the, primary, tool, to, bring, about, desegregation, they, were, faced, with, massive, resistance, in, the, south, by, proponents, of, racial, segregation, and, voter, suppression, in, defiance, african, american, activists, adopted, a, combined, strategy, of, direct, action, nonviolence, nonviolent, resistance, and, many, events, described, as, civil, disobedience, giving, rise, to, the, civil, rights, movement, of, 1954, to, 1968, a, philip, randolph, had, planned, a, march, on, washington, d, c, in, 1941, to, support, demands, for, elimination, of, employment, discrimination, in, the, defense, industry, he, called, off, the, march, when, the, roosevelt, administration, met, the, demand, by, issuing, executive, order, 8802, which, barred, racial, discrimination, and, created, an, agency, to, oversee, compliance, with, the, order, the, strategy, of, public, education, legislative, lobbying, and, litigation, that, had, typified, the, civil, rights, movement, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, broadened, after, brown, to, a, strategy, that, emphasized, direct, action, boycotts, sit, ins, freedom, rides, marches, or, walks, and, similar, tactics, that, relied, on, mass, mobilization, nonviolent, resistance, standing, in, line, and, at, times, civil, disobedience, churches, local, grassroots, organizations, fraternal, societies, and, black, owned, businesses, mobilized, volunteers, to, participate, in, broad, based, actions, this, was, a, more, direct, and, potentially, more, rapid, means, of, creating, change, than, the, traditional, approach, of, mounting, court, challenges, used, by, the, naacp, and, others, in, 1952, the, regional, council, of, negro, leadership, rcnl, led, by, t, r, m, howard, a, black, surgeon, entrepreneur, and, planter, organized, a, successful, boycott, of, gas, stations, in, mississippi, that, refused, to, provide, restrooms, for, blacks, through, the, rcnl, howard, led, campaigns, to, expose, brutality, by, the, mississippi, state, highway, patrol, and, to, encourage, blacks, to, make, deposits, in, the, black, owned, tri, state, bank, of, nashville, which, in, turn, gave, loans, to, civil, rights, activists, who, were, victims, of, a, credit, squeeze, by, the, white, citizens, councils, after, claudette, colvin, was, arrested, for, not, giving, up, her, seat, on, a, montgomery, alabama, bus, in, march, 1955, a, bus, boycott, was, considered, and, rejected, but, when, rosa, parks, was, arrested, in, december, jo, ann, gibson, robinson, of, the, montgomery, women, s, political, council, put, the, bus, boycott, protest, in, motion, late, that, night, she, john, cannon, chairman, of, the, business, department, at, alabama, state, university, and, others, mimeographed, and, distributed, thousands, of, leaflets, calling, for, a, boycott, the, eventual, success, of, the, boycott, made, its, spokesman, martin, luther, king, jr, a, nationally, known, figure, it, also, inspired, other, bus, boycotts, such, as, the, successful, tallahassee, florida, boycott, of, 1956, 57, this, movement, also, sparked, the, 1956, sugar, bowl, riots, in, atlanta, which, later, became, a, major, organizing, center, of, the, civil, rights, movement, with, martin, luther, king, jr, in, 1957, king, and, ralph, abernathy, the, leaders, of, the, montgomery, improvement, association, joined, with, other, church, leaders, who, had, led, similar, boycott, efforts, such, as, c, k, steele, of, tallahassee, and, t, j, jemison, of, baton, rouge, and, other, activists, such, as, fred, shuttlesworth, ella, baker, a, philip, randolph, bayard, rustin, and, stanley, levison, to, form, the, southern, christian, leadership, conference, sclc, the, sclc, with, its, headquarters, in, atlanta, georgia, did, not, attempt, to, create, a, network, of, chapters, as, the, naacp, did, it, offered, training, and, leadership, assistance, for, local, efforts, to, fight, segregation, the, headquarters, organization, raised, funds, mostly, from, northern, sources, to, support, such, campaigns, it, made, nonviolence, both, its, central, tenet, and, its, primary, method, of, confronting, racism, in, 1959, septima, clarke, bernice, robinson, and, esau, jenkins, with, the, help, of, myles, horton, s, highlander, folk, school, in, tennessee, began, the, first, citizenship, schools, in, south, carolina, s, sea, islands, they, taught, literacy, to, enable, blacks, to, pass, voting, tests, the, program, was, an, enormous, success, and, tripled, the, number, of, black, voters, on, johns, island, sclc, took, over, the, program, and, duplicated, its, results, elsewhere, from, 1954, to, 1968, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, united, states, made, significant, strides, in, challenging, racial, segregation, and, discrimination, the, movement, was, catalyzed, by, the, supreme, court, s, landmark, decision, in, brown, v, board, of, education, 1954, which, declared, racial, segregation, in, public, schools, unconstitutional, this, ruling, set, the, stage, for, further, activism, including, the, montgomery, bus, boycott, 1955, 1956, led, by, rosa, parks, and, martin, luther, king, jr, and, the, freedom, rides, 1961, that, challenged, segregation, in, interstate, bus, travel, these, nonviolent, protests, highlighted, the, systemic, racial, injustices, faced, by, african, americans, and, garnered, national, and, international, attention, the, movement, achieved, legislative, victories, most, notably, the, passage, of, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, and, voting, rights, act, of, 1965, the, civil, rights, act, outlawed, discrimination, based, on, race, color, religion, sex, or, national, origin, in, employment, and, public, accommodations, while, the, voting, rights, act, sought, to, eliminate, barriers, to, voting,

participate, fully, in, american, civic, life, the, assassination, of, martin, luther, king, jr, in, 1968, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, civil, rights, movement, his, death, sparked, riots, in, over, 100, cities, and, led, to, the, passage, of, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1968, also, known, as, the, fair, housing, act, which, aimed, to, end, discrimination, in, the, sale, rental, and, financing, of, housing, despite, these, legislative, successes, the, movement, faced, significant, challenges, including, ongoing, racial, violence, and, the, persistence, of, de, facto, segregation, in, housing, and, education, the, assassination, of, king, underscored, the, profound, resistance, to, racial, equality, that, continued, to, pervade, american, society, african, american, women, in, the, civil, rights, movement, were, pivotal, to, its, success, they, volunteered, as, activists, advocates, educators, clerics, writers, spiritual, guides, caretakers, and, politicians, for, the,

believed, it, could, help, them, contribute, to, the, cause, of, civil, rights, some, of, those, involved, with, the, black, panthers, were, nationally, recognized, as, leaders, and, still, others, did, editorial, work, on, the, black, panther, newspaper, spurring, internal, discussions, about, gender, issues, ella, baker, founded, the, sncc, and, was, a, prominent, figure, in, the, civil, rights, movement, female, students, involved, with, the, sncc, helped, to, organize, sit, ins, and, the, freedom, rides, at, the, same, time, many, elderly, black, women, in, towns, across, the, southern, us, cared, for, the, organization, s, volunteers, at, their, homes, providing, the, students, food, a, bed, healing, aid, and, motherly, love, other, women, involved, also, formed, church, groups, bridge, clubs, and, professional, organizations, such, as, the, national, council, of, negro, women, to, help, achieve, freedom, for, themselves, and, their, race, several, who, participated, in, these, organizations, lost, their, jobs, because, of, their, involvement, many, women, who, participated, in, the, movement, experienced, gender, discrimination, and, sexual, harassment, in, the, sclc, ella, baker, s, input, was, discouraged, in, spite, of, her, being, the, oldest, and, most, experienced, person, on, the, staff, there, are, many, other, accounts, and, examples, on, december, 17, 1951, the, communist, party, affiliated, civil, rights, congress, delivered, the, petition, we, charge, genocide, the, crime, of, government, against, the, negro, people, to, the, united, nations, arguing, that, the, u, s, federal, government, by, its, failure, to, act, against, lynching, in, the, united, states, was, guilty, of, genocide, under, article, ii, of, the, un, genocide, convention, see, black, genocide, the, petition, was, presented, to, the, united, nations, at, two, separate, venues, paul, robeson, a, concert, singer, and, activist, presented, it, to, a, un, official, in, new, york, city, while, william, l, patterson, executive, director, of, the, crc, delivered, copies, of, the, drafted, petition, to, a, un, delegation, in, paris, patterson, the, editor, of, the, petition, was, a, leader, of, the, communist, party, usa, and, head, of, the, international, labor, defense, a, group, that, offered, legal, representation, to, communists, trade, unionists, and, african, americans, who, were, involved, in, cases, that, involved, issues, of, political, or, racial, persecution, the, ild, was, known, for, leading, the, defense, of, the, scottsboro, boys, in, alabama, in, 1931, where, the, communist, party, had, a, considerable, amount, of, influence, among, african, americans, in, the, 1930s, this, influence, had, largely, declined, by, the, late, 1950s, although, it, could, command, international, attention, as, earlier, civil, rights, figures, such, as, robeson, du, bois, and, patterson, became, more, politically, radical, and, therefore, targets, of, cold, war, anti, communism, by, the, u, s, government, they, lost, favor, with, mainstream, black, america, as, well, as, with, the, naacp, in, order, to, secure, a, place, in, the, political, mainstream, and, gain, the, broadest, base, of, support, the, new, generation, of, civil, rights, activists, believed, that, it, had, to, openly, distance, itself, from, anything, and, anyone, associated, with, the, communist, party, according, to, ella, baker, the, southern, christian, leadership, conference, added, the, word, christian, to, its, name, in, order, to, deter, charges, that, it, was, associated, with, communism, under, j, edgar, hoover, the, fbi, had, been, concerned, about, communism, since, the, early, 20th, century, and, it, kept, civil, rights, activists, under, close, surveillance, and, labeled, some, of, them, communist, or, subversive, a, practice, that, continued, during, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, early, 1960s, the, practice, of, distancing, the, civil, rights, movement, from, reds, was, challenged, by, the, student, nonviolent, coordinating, committee, which, adopted, a, policy, of, accepting, assistance, and, participation, from, anyone, who, supported, the, sncc, s, political, program, and, was, willing, to, put, their, body, on, the, line, regardless, of, political, affiliation, at, times, the, sncc, s, policy, of, political, openness, put, it, at, odds, with, the, naacp, while, most, popular, representations, of, the, movement, are, centered, on, the, leadership, and, philosophy, of, martin, luther, king, jr, some, scholars, note, that, the, movement, was, too, diverse, to, be, credited, to, one, person, organization, or, strategy, sociologist, doug, mcadam, has, stated, that, in, king, s, case, it, would, be, inaccurate, to, say, that, he, was, the, leader, of, the, modern, civil, rights, movement, but, more, importantly, there, was, no, singular, civil, rights, movement, the, movement, was, in, fact, a, coalition, of, thousands, of, local, efforts, nationwide, spanning, several, decades, hundreds, of, discrete, groups, and, all, manner, of, strategies, and, tactics, legal, illegal, institutional, non, institutional, violent, non, violent, without, discounting, king, s, importance, it, would, be, sheer, fiction, to, call, him, the, leader, of, what, was, fundamentally, an, amorphous, fluid, dispersed, movement, decentralized, grassroots, leadership, has, been, a, major, focus, of, movement, scholarship, in, recent, decades, through, the, work, of, historians, john, dittmer, charles, payne, barbara, ransby, and, others, the, jim, crow, system, employed, terror, as, a, means, of, social, control, with, the, most, organized, manifestations, being, the, ku, klux, klan, and, their, collaborators, in, local, police, departments, this, violence, played, a, key, role, in, blocking, the, progress, of, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, late, 1950s, some, black, organizations, in, the, south, began, practicing, armed, self, defense, the, first, to, do, so, openly, was, the, monroe, north, carolina, chapter, of, the, naacp, led, by, robert, f, williams, williams, had, rebuilt, the, chapter, after, its, membership, was, terrorized, out, of, public, life, by, the, klan, he, did, so, by, encouraging, a, new, more, working, class, membership, to, arm, itself, thoroughly, and, defend, against, attack, when, klan, nightriders, attacked, the, home, of, naacp, member, albert, perry, in, october, 1957, williams, militia, exchanged, gunfire, with, the, stunned, klansmen, who, quickly, retreated, the, following, day, the, city, council, held, an, emergency, session, and, passed, an, ordinance, banning, kkk, motorcades, one, year, later, lumbee, indians, in, north, carolina, would, have, a, similarly, successful, armed, stand, off, with, the, klan, known, as, the, battle, of, hayes, pond, which, resulted, in, kkk, leader, james, w, catfish, cole, being, convicted, of, incitement, to, riot, after, the, acquittal, of, several, white, men, charged, with, sexually, assaulting, black, women, in, monroe, williams, announced, to, united, press, international, reporters, that, he, would, meet, violence, with, violence, as, a, policy, williams, declaration, was, quoted, on, the, front, page, of, the, new, york, times, and, the, carolina, times, considered, it, the, biggest, civil, rights, story, of, 1959, naacp, national, chairman, roy, wilkins, immediately, suspended, williams, from, his, position, but, the, monroe, organizer, won, support, from, numerous, naacp, chapters, across, the, country, ultimately, wilkins, resorted, to, bribing, influential, organizer, daisy, bates, to, campaign, against, williams, at, the, naacp, national, convention, and, the, suspension, was, upheld, the, convention, nonetheless, passed, a, resolution, which, stated, we, do, not, deny, but, reaffirm, the, right, of, individual, and, collective, self, defense, against, unlawful, assaults, martin, luther, king, jr, argued, for, williams, removal, but, ella, baker, and, web, dubois, both, publicly, praised, the, monroe, leader, s, position, williams, along, with, his, wife, mabel, williams, continued, to, play, a, leadership, role, in, the, monroe, movement, and, to, some, degree, in, the, national, movement, the, williamses, published, the, crusader, a, nationally, circulated, newsletter, beginning, in, 1960, and, the, influential, book, negroes, with, guns, in, 1962, williams, did, not, call, for, full, militarization, in, this, period, but, flexibility, in, the, freedom, struggle, williams, was, well, versed, in, legal, tactics, and, publicity, which, he, had, used, successfully, in, the, internationally, known, kissing, case, of, 1958, as, well, as, nonviolent, methods, which, he, used, at, lunch, counter, sit, ins, in, monroe, all, with, armed, self, defense, as, a, complementary, tactic, williams, led, the, monroe, movement, in, another, armed, stand, off, with, white, supremacists, during, an, august, 1961, freedom, ride, he, had, been, invited, to, participate, in, the, campaign, by, ella, baker, and, james, forman, of, the, student, nonviolent, coordinating, committee, sncc, the, incident, along, with, his, campaigns, for, peace, with, cuba, resulted, in, him, being, targeted, by, the, fbi, and, prosecuted, for, kidnapping, he, was, cleared, of, all, charges, in, 1976, meanwhile, armed, self, defense, continued, discreetly, in, the, southern, movement, with, such, figures, as, sncc, s, amzie, moore, hartman, turnbow, and, fannie, lou, hamer, all, willing, to, use, arms, to, defend, their, lives, from, nightrides, taking, refuge, from, the, fbi, in, cuba, the, willamses, broadcast, the, radio, show, radio, free, dixie, throughout, the, eastern, united, states, via, radio, progresso, beginning, in, 1962, in, this, period, williams, advocated, guerilla, warfare, against, racist, institutions, and, saw, the, large, ghetto, riots, of, the, era, as, a, manifestation, of, his, strategy, university, of, north, carolina, historian, walter, rucker, has, written, that, the, emergence, of, robert, f, williams, contributed, to, the, marked, decline, in, anti, black, racial, violence, in, the, u, s, after, centuries, of, anti, black, violence, african, americans, across, the, country, began, to, defend, their, communities, aggressively, employing, overt, force, when, necessary, this, in, turn, evoked, in, whites, real, fear, of, black, vengeance, this, opened, up, space, for, african, americans, to, use, nonviolent, demonstrations, with, less, fear, of, deadly, reprisal, of, the, many, civil, rights, activists, who, share, this, view, the, most, prominent, was, rosa, parks, parks, gave, the, eulogy, at, williams, funeral, in, 1996, praising, him, for, his, courage, and, for, his, commitment, to, freedom, and, concluding, that, the, sacrifices, he, made, and, what, he, did, should, go, down, in, history, and, never, be, forgotten, jewish, americans, played, an, active, role, supporting, the, civil, rights, movement, and, were, actively, involved, in, establishing, and, supporting, a, number, of, the, most, important, civil, rights, organizations, including, the, naacp, the, leadership, conference, on, civil, and, human, rights, the, southern, christian, leadership, conference, sclc, and, the, student, nonviolent, coordinating, committee, sncc, these, organizations, played, pivotal, roles, in, the, civil, rights, movement, advocating, for, racial, equality, and, justice, despite, representing, less, than, 2, of, the, us, population, jews, made, up, roughly, half, of, all, civil, rights, lawyers, in, the, south, during, the, 1960s, and, half, of, the, white, northern, volunteers, involved, in, the, 1964, mississippi, freedom, summer, project, partly, in, response, to, the, march, on, washington, movement, under, truman, s, predecessor, franklin, d, roosevelt, the, fair, employment, practices, committee, was, created, to, address, racial, discrimination, in, employment, and, in, 1946, truman, created, the, president, s, committee, on, civil, rights, on, june, 29, 1947, truman, became, the, first, president, to, address, the, demands, of, the, national, association, for, the, advancement, of, colored, people, naacp, the, speech, took, place, at, the, lincoln, memorial, during, the, naacp, convention, and, was, carried, nationally, on, radio, in, that, speech, truman, laid, out, his, agreement, on, the, need, to, end, discrimination, which, would, be, advanced, by, the, first, comprehensive, presidentially, proposed, civil, rights, legislation, truman, on, civil, rights, and, human, freedom, declared, our, immediate, task, is, to, remove, the, last, remnants, of, the, barriers, which, stand, between, millions, of, our, citizens, and, their, birthright, there, is, no, justifiable, reason, for, discrimination, because, of, ancestry, or, religion, or, race, or, color, we, must, not, tolerate, such, limitations, on, the, freedom, of, any, of, our, people, and, on, their, enjoyment, of, basic, rights, which, every, citizen, in, a, truly, democratic, society, must, possess, in, february, 1948, truman, delivered, a, formal, message, to, congress, requesting, adoption, of, his, 10, point, program, to, secure, civil, rights, including, anti, lynching, voter, rights, and, elimination, of, segregation, no, political, act, since, the, compromise, of, 1877, argued, biographer, taylor, branch, so, profoundly, influenced, race, relations, in, a, sense, it, was, a, repeal, of, 1877, truman, was, opposed, by, the, conservative, coalition, in, congress, so, instead, issued, executive, orders, 9980, and, 9981, ending, discrimination, in, federal, employment, and, in, the, armed, forces, while, not, a, key, focus, of, his, administration, president, eisenhower, made, several, conservative, strides, toward, making, america, a, racially, integrated, country, the, year, he, was, elected, eisenhower, desegregated, washington, d, c, after, hearing, a, story, about, an, african, american, man, who, was, unable, to, rent, a, hotel, room, buy, a, meal, access, drinking, water, and, attend, a, movie, shortly, after, this, act, eisenhower, utilized, hollywood, personalities, to, pressure, movie, theatres, into, desegregating, as, well, under, the, previous, administration, president, truman, signed, executive, order, 9981, to, desegregate, the, military, however, truman, s, executive, order, had, hardly, been, enforced, president, eisenhower, made, it, a, point, to, enforce, the, executive, order, by, october, 30, 1954, there, were, no, segregated, combat, units, in, the, united, states, not, only, this, but, eisenhower, also, desegregated, the, veterans, administration, and, military, bases, in, the, south, including, federal, schools, for, military, dependents, expanding, his, work, beyond, the, military, eisenhower, formed, two, non, discrimination, committees, one, to, broker, nondiscrimination, agreements, with, government, contractors, and, a, second, to, end, discrimination, within, government, departments, and, agencies, the, first, major, piece, of, civil, rights, legislation, since, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1875, was, also, passed, under, the, eisenhower, administration, president, eisenhower, proposed, championed, and, signed, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1957, the, legislation, established, the, civil, rights, commission, and, the, justice, department, s, civil, rights, division, and, banned, intimidating, coercing, and, other, means, of, interfering, with, a, citizen, s, right, to, vote, eisenhower, s, work, in, desegregating, the, judicial, system, is, also, notable, the, judges, he, appointed, were, liberal, when, it, came, to, the, subject, of, civil, rights, desegregation, and, he, actively, avoided, placing, segregationists, in, federal, courts, for, the, first, two, years, of, the, kennedy, administration, civil, rights, activists, had, mixed, opinions, of, both, the, president, and, his, younger, brother, robert, f, kennedy, the, attorney, general, historian, david, halberstam, wrote, that, the, race, question, was, for, a, long, time, a, minor, ethnic, political, issue, in, massachusetts, where, the, kennedy, brothers, came, from, and, had, they, been, from, another, part, of, the, country, they, might, have, been, more, immediately, sensitive, to, the, complexities, and, depth, of, black, feelings, a, well, of, historical, skepticism, toward, liberal, politics, had, left, african, americans, with, a, sense, of, uneasy, disdain, for, any, white, politician, who, claimed, to, share, their, concerns, for, freedom, particularly, ones, connected, to, the, historically, pro, segregationist, democratic, party, still, many, were, encouraged, by, the, discreet, support, kennedy, gave, to, king, and, the, administration, s, willingness, after, dramatic, pressure, from, civil, disobedience, to, bring, forth, racially, egalitarian, initiatives, many, of, the, initiatives, resulted, from, robert, kennedy, s, passion, the, younger, kennedy, gained, a, rapid, education, in, the, realities, of, racism, through, events, such, as, the, baldwin, kennedy, meeting, the, president, came, to, share, his, brother, s, sense, of, urgency, on, the, matter, resulting, in, the, landmark, civil, rights, address, of, june, 1963, and, the, introduction, of, the, first, major, civil, rights, act, of, the, decade, robert, kennedy, expressed, the, administration, s, commitment, to, civil, rights, during, a, may, 6, 1961, speech, at, the, university, of, georgia, law, school, our, position, is, quite, clear, we, are, upholding, the, law, the, federal, government, would, not, be, running, the, schools, in, prince, edward, county, any, more, than, it, is, running, the, university, of, georgia, or, the, schools, in, my, home, state, of, massachusetts, in, this, case, in, all, cases, i, say, to, you, today, that, if, the, orders, of, the, court, are, circumvented, the, department, of, justice, will, act, we, will, not, stand, by, or, be, aloof, we, will, move, i, happen, to, believe, that, the, 1954, decision, was, right, but, my, belief, does, not, matter, it, is, now, the, law, some, of, you, may, believe, the, decision, was, wrong, that, does, not, matter, it, is, the, law, that, same, month, during, the, freedom, rides, robert, kennedy, became, concerned, with, the, issue, when, photographs, of, the, burning, bus, and, savage, beatings, in, anniston, and, birmingham, were, broadcast, around, the, world, they, came, at, an, especially, embarrassing, time, as, president, kennedy, was, about, to, have, a, summit, with, the, soviet, premier, in, vienna, the, white, house, was, concerned, with, its, image, among, the, populations, of, newly, independent, nations, in, africa, and, asia, and, robert, kennedy, responded, with, an, address, for, voice, of, america, stating, that, great, progress, had, been, made, on, the, issue, of, race, relations, meanwhile, behind, the, scenes, the, administration, worked, to, resolve, the, crisis, with, a, minimum, of, violence, and, prevent, the, freedom, riders, from, generating, a, fresh, crop, of, headlines, that, might, divert, attention, from, the, president, s, international, agenda, the, freedom, riders, documentary, notes, that, the, back, burner, issue, of, civil, rights, had, collided, with, the, urgent, demands, of, cold, war, realpolitik, on, may, 21, when, a, white, mob, attacked, and, burned, the, first, baptist, church, in, montgomery, alabama, where, king, was, holding, out, with, protesters, robert, kennedy, telephoned, king, to, ask, him, to, stay, in, the, building, until, the, u, s, marshals, and, national, guard, could, secure, the, area, king, proceeded, to, berate, kennedy, for, allowing, the, situation, to, continue, king, later, publicly, thanked, kennedy, for, deploying, the, force, to, break, up, an, attack, that, might, otherwise, have, ended, king, s, life, with, a, very, small, majority, in, congress, the, president, s, ability, to, press, ahead, with, legislation, relied, considerably, on, a, balancing, game, with, the, senators, and, congressmen, of, the, south, without, the, support, of, vice, president, johnson, a, former, senator, who, had, years, of, experience, in, congress, and, longstanding, relations, there, many, of, the, attorney, general, s, programs, would, not, have, progressed, by, late, 1962, frustration, at, the, slow, pace, of, political, change, was, balanced, by, the, movement, s, strong, support, for, legislative, initiatives, including, administrative, representation, across, all, u, s, government, departments, and, greater, access, to, the, ballot, box, from, squaring, off, against, governor, george, wallace, to, tearing, into, vice, president, johnson, for, failing, to, desegregate, areas, of, the, administration, to, threatening, corrupt, white, southern, judges, with, disbarment, to, desegregating, interstate, transport, robert, kennedy, came, to, be, consumed, by, the, civil, rights, movement, he, continued, to, work, on, these, social, justice, issues, in, his, bid, for, the, presidency, in, 1968, on, the, night, of, governor, wallace, s, capitulation, to, african, american, enrollment, at, the, university, of, alabama, president, kennedy, gave, an, address, to, the, nation, which, marked, the, changing, tide, an, address, that, was, to, become, a, landmark, for, the, ensuing, change, in, political, policy, as, to, civil, rights, in, 1966, robert, kennedy, visited, south, africa, and, voiced, his, objections, to, apartheid, the, first, time, a, major, us, politician, had, done, so, at, the, university, of, natal, in, durban, i, was, told, the, church, to, which, most, of, the, white, population, belongs, teaches, apartheid, as, a, moral, necessity, a, questioner, declared, that, few, churches, allow, black, africans, to, pray, with, the, white, because, the, bible, says, that, is, the, way, it, should, be, because, god, created, negroes, to, serve, but, suppose, god, is, black, i, replied, what, if, we, go, to, heaven, and, we, all, our, lives, have, treated, the, negro, as, an, inferior, and, god, is, there, and, we, look, up, and, he, is, not, white, what, then, is, our, response, there, was, no, answer, only, silence, robert, kennedy, s, relationship, with, the, movement, was, not, always, positive, as, attorney, general, he, was, called, to, account, by, activists, who, booed, him, at, a, june, 1963, speech, for, the, justice, department, s, own, poor, record, of, hiring, blacks, he, also, presided, over, fbi, director, j, edgar, hoover, and, his, cointelpro, program, this, program, ordered, fbi, agents, to, expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or, otherwise, neutralize, the, activities, of, communist, front, groups, a, category, in, which, the, paranoid, hoover, included, most, civil, rights, organizations, kennedy, personally, authorized, some, of, the, programs, according, to, tim, weiner, rfk, knew, much, more, about, this, surveillance, than, he, ever, admitted, although, kennedy, only, gave, approval, for, limited, wiretapping, of, king, s, phones, on, a, trial, basis, for, a, month, or, so, hoover, extended, the, clearance, so, his, men, were, unshackled, to, look, for, evidence, in, any, areas, of, the, black, leader, s, life, they, deemed, important, they, then, used, this, information, to, harass, king, kennedy, directly, ordered, surveillance, on, james, baldwin, after, their, antagonistic, racial, summit, in, 1963, lyndon, johnson, made, civil, rights, one, of, his, highest, priorities, coupling, it, with, a, war, on, poverty, however, the, increasing, opposition, to, the, vietnam, war, coupled, with, the, cost, of, the, war, undercut, support, for, his, domestic, programs, under, kennedy, major, civil, rights, legislation, had, been, stalled, in, congress, his, assassination, changed, everything, on, one, hand, president, lyndon, johnson, was, a, much, more, skillful, negotiator, than, kennedy, but, he, had, behind, him, a, powerful, national, momentum, demanding, immediate, action, on, moral, and, emotional, grounds, demands, for, immediate, action, originated, from, unexpected, directions, especially, white, protestant, church, groups, the, justice, department, led, by, robert, kennedy, moved, from, a, posture, of, defending, kennedy, from, the, quagmire, minefield, of, racial, politics, to, acting, to, fulfill, his, legacy, the, violent, death, and, public, reaction, dramatically, moved, the, conservative, republicans, led, by, senator, everett, mckinley, dirksen, whose, support, was, the, margin, of, victory, for, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, the, act, immediately, ended, de,

with, martin, luther, king, jr, at, the, capitol, malcolm, had, tried, to, begin, a, dialog, with, king, as, early, as, 1957, but, king, had, rebuffed, him, malcolm, had, responded, by, calling, king, an, uncle, tom, saying, he, had, turned, his, back, on, black, militancy, in, order, to, appease, the, white, power, structure, but, the, two, men, were, on, good, terms, at, their, face, to, face, meeting, there, is, evidence, that, king, was, preparing, to, support, malcolm, s, plan, to, formally, bring, the, u, s, government, before, the, united, nations, on, charges, of, human, rights, violations, against, african, americans, malcolm, now, encouraged, black, nationalists, to, get, involved, in, voter, registration, drives, and, other, forms, of, community, organizing, to, redefine, and, expand, the, movement, civil, rights, activists, became, increasingly, combative, in, the, 1963, to, 1964, period, seeking, to, defy, such, events, as, the, thwarting, of, the, albany, campaign, police, repression, and, ku, klux, klan, terrorism, in, birmingham, and, the, assassination, of, medgar, evers, the, latter, s, brother, charles, evers, who, took, over, as, mississippi, naacp, field,

reaching, effect, on, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, south, there, had, been, a, long, tradition, of, self, reliance, malcolm, x, s, ideas, now, touched, that, tradition, self, reliance, was, becoming, paramount, in, light, of, the, 1964, democratic, national, convention, s, decision, to, refuse, seating, to, the, mississippi, freedom, democratic, party, mfdp, and, instead, to, seat, the, regular, state, delegation, which, had, been, elected, in, violation, of, the, party, s, own, rules, and, by, jim, crow, law, instead, sncc, moved, in, an, increasingly, militant, direction, and, worked, with, malcolm, x, on, two, harlem, mfdp, fundraisers, in, december, 1964, when, fannie, lou, hamer, spoke, to, harlemites, about, the, jim, crow, violence, that, she, d, suffered, in, mississippi, she, linked, it, directly, to, the, northern, police, brutality, against, blacks, that, malcolm, protested, against, when, malcolm, asserted, that, african, americans, should, emulate, the, mau, mau, army, of, kenya, in, efforts, to, gain, their, independence, many, in, sncc, applauded, during, the, selma, campaign, for, voting, rights, in, 1965, malcolm, made, it, known, that, he, d, heard, reports, of, increased, threats, of, lynching, around, selma, in, late, january, he, sent, an, open, telegram, to, george, lincoln, rockwell, the, head, of, the, american, nazi, party, stating, if, your, present, racist, agitation, against, our, people, there, in, alabama, causes, physical, harm, to, reverend, king, or, any, other, black, americans, you, and, your, kkk, friends, will, be, met, with, maximum, physical, retaliation, from, those, of, us, who, are, not, handcuffed, by, the, disarming, philosophy, of, nonviolence, the, following, month, the, selma, chapter, of, sncc, invited, malcolm, to, speak, to, a, mass, meeting, there, on, the, day, of, malcolm, s, appearance, president, johnson, made, his, first, public, statement, in, support, of, the, selma, campaign, paul, ryan, haygood, a, co, director, of, the, naacp, legal, defense, fund, credits, malcolm, with, a, role, in, gaining, support, by, the, federal, government, haygood, noted, that, shortly, after, malcolm, s, visit, to, selma, a, federal, judge, responding, to, a, suit, brought, by, the, department, of, justice, required, dallas, county, alabama, registrars, to, process, at, least, 100, black, applications, each, day, their, offices, were, open, many, in, the, jewish, community, supported, the, civil, rights, movement, in, fact, statistically, jews, were, one, of, the, most, actively, involved, non, black, groups, in, the, movement, many, jewish, students, worked, in, concert, with, african, americans, for, core, sclc, and, sncc, as, full, time, organizers, and, summer, volunteers, during, the, civil, rights, era, jews, made, up, roughly, half, of, the, white, northern, and, western, volunteers, involved, in, the, 1964, mississippi, freedom, summer, project, and, approximately, half, of, the, civil, rights, attorneys, active, in, the, south, during, the, 1960s, jewish, leaders, were, arrested, while, heeding, a, call, from, martin, luther, king, jr, in, st, augustine, florida, in, june, 1964, where, the, largest, mass, arrest, of, rabbis, in, american, history, took, place, at, the, monson, motor, lodge, abraham, joshua, heschel, a, writer, rabbi, and, professor, of, theology, at, the, jewish, theological, seminary, of, america, in, new, york, was, outspoken, on, the, subject, of, civil, rights, he, marched, arm, in, arm, with, king, in, the, 1965, selma, to, montgomery, march, in, the, 1964, murders, of, chaney, goodman, and, schwerner, the, two, white, activists, killed, andrew, goodman, and, michael, schwerner, were, both, jewish, brandeis, university, the, only, nonsectarian, jewish, sponsored, college, university, in, the, world, created, the, transitional, year, program, typ, in, 1968, in, part, response, to, the, assassination, of, martin, luther, king, jr, the, faculty, created, it, to, renew, the, university, s, commitment, to, social, justice, recognizing, brandeis, as, a, university, with, a, commitment, to, academic, excellence, these, faculty, members, created, a, chance, for, disadvantaged, students, to, participate, in, an, empowering, educational, experience, the, american, jewish, committee, american, jewish, congress, and, anti, defamation, league, adl, actively, promoted, civil, rights, while, jews, were, very, active, in, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, south, in, the, north, many, had, experienced, a, more, strained, relationship, with, african, americans, it, has, been, argued, that, with, black, militancy, and, the, black, power, movements, on, the, rise, black, anti, semitism, increased, leading, to, strained, relations, between, blacks, and, jews, in, northern, communities, in, new, york, city, most, notably, there, was, a, major, socio, economic, class, difference, in, the, perception, of, african, americans, by, jews, jews, from, better, educated, upper, middle, class, backgrounds, were, often, very, supportive, of, african, american, civil, rights, activities, while, the, jews, in, poorer, urban, communities, that, became, increasingly, minority, were, often, less, supportive, largely, in, part, due, to, more, negative, and, violent, interactions, between, the, two, groups, according, to, political, scientist, michael, rogin, jewish, black, hostility, was, a, two, way, street, extending, to, earlier, decades, in, the, post, world, war, ii, era, jews, were, granted, white, privilege, and, most, moved, into, the, middle, class, while, blacks, were, left, behind, in, the, ghetto, urban, jews, engaged, in, the, same, sort, of, conflicts, with, blacks, over, integration, busing, local, control, of, schools, housing, crime, communal, identity, and, class, divides, that, other, white, ethnics, did, leading, to, jews, participating, in, white, flight, the, culmination, of, this, was, the, 1968, new, york, city, teachers, strike, pitting, largely, jewish, schoolteachers, against, predominantly, black, parents, in, brownsville, new, york, many, jews, in, the, southern, states, who, supported, civil, rights, for, african, americans, tended, to, keep, a, low, profile, on, the, race, issue, in, order, to, avoid, attracting, the, attention, of, the, anti, black, and, antisemitic, ku, klux, klan, however, klan, groups, exploited, the, issue, of, african, american, integration, and, jewish, involvement, in, the, struggle, in, order, to, commit, violently, antisemitic, hate, crimes, as, an, example, of, this, hatred, in, one, year, alone, from, november, 1957, to, october, 1958, temples, and, other, jewish, communal, gatherings, were, bombed, and, desecrated, in, atlanta, nashville, jacksonville, and, miami, and, dynamite, was, found, under, synagogues, in, birmingham, charlotte, and, gastonia, north, carolina, some, rabbis, received, death, threats, but, there, were, no, injuries, following, these, outbursts, of, violence, despite, the, common, notion, that, the, ideas, of, martin, luther, king, jr, malcolm, x, and, black, power, only, conflicted, with, each, other, and, were, the, only, ideologies, of, the, civil, rights, movement, there, were, other, sentiments, felt, by, many, blacks, fearing, the, events, during, the, movement, was, occurring, too, quickly, there, were, some, blacks, who, felt, that, leaders, should, take, their, activism, at, an, incremental, pace, others, had, reservations, on, how, focused, blacks, were, on, the, movement, and, felt, that, such, attention, was, better, spent, on, reforming, issues, within, the, black, community, while, conservatives, in, general, supported, integration, some, defended, incrementally, phased, out, segregation, as, a, backstop, against, assimilation, based, on, her, interpretation, of, a, 1966, study, made, by, donald, matthews, and, james, prothro, detailing, the, relative, percentage, of, blacks, for, integration, against, it, or, feeling, something, else, lauren, winner, asserts, that, black, defenders, of, segregation, look, at, first, blush, very, much, like, black, nationalists, especially, in, their, preference, for, all, black, institutions, but, black, defenders, of, segregation, differ, from, nationalists, in, two, key, ways, first, while, both, groups, criticize, naacp, style, integration, nationalists, articulate, a, third, alternative, to, integration, and, jim, crow, while, segregationists, preferred, to, stick, with, the, status, quo, second, absent, from, black, defenders, of, segregation, s, political, vocabulary, was, the, demand, for, self, determination, they, called, for, all, black, institutions, but, not, autonomous, all, black, institutions, indeed, some, defenders, of, segregation, asserted, that, black, people, needed, white, paternalism, and, oversight, in, order, to, thrive, oftentimes, african, american, community, leaders, would, be, staunch, defenders, of, segregation, church, ministers, businessmen, and, educators, were, among, those, who, wished, to, keep, segregation, and, segregationist, ideals, in, order, to, retain, the, privileges, they, gained, from, patronage, from, whites, such, as, monetary, gains, in, addition, they, relied, on, segregation, to, keep, their, jobs, and, economies, in, their, communities, thriving, it, was, feared, that, if, integration, became, widespread, in, the, south, black, owned, businesses, and, other, establishments, would, lose, a, large, chunk, of, their, customer, base, to, white, owned, businesses, and, many, blacks, would, lose, opportunities, for, jobs, that, were, presently, exclusive, to, their, interests, on, the, other, hand, there, were, the, everyday, average, black, people, who, criticized, integration, as, well, for, them, they, took, issue, with, different, parts, of, the, civil, rights, movement, and, the, potential, for, blacks, to, exercise, consumerism, and, economic, liberty, without, hindrance, from, whites, for, martin, luther, king, jr, malcolm, x, and, other, leading, activists, and, groups, during, the, movement, these, opposing, viewpoints, acted, as, an, obstacle, against, their, ideas, these, different, views, made, such, leaders, work, much, harder, to, accomplish, but, they, were, nonetheless, important, in, the, overall, scope, of, the, movement, for, the, most, part, the, black, individuals, who, had, reservations, on, various, aspects, of, the, movement, and, ideologies, of, the, activists, were, not, able, to, make, a, game, changing, dent, in, their, efforts, but, the, existence, of, these, alternate, ideas, gave, some, blacks, an, outlet, to, express, their, concerns, about, the, changing, social, structure, during, the, freedom, summer, campaign, of, 1964, numerous, tensions, within, the, civil, rights, movement, came, to, the, forefront, many, blacks, in, sncc, developed, concerns, that, white, activists, from, the, north, and, west, were, taking, over, the, movement, the, participation, by, numerous, white, students, was, not, reducing, the, amount, of, violence, that, sncc, suffered, but, seemed, to, exacerbate, it, additionally, there, was, profound, disillusionment, at, lyndon, johnson, s, denial, of, voting, status, for, the, mississippi, freedom, democratic, party, at, the, democratic, national, convention, meanwhile, during, core, s, work, in, louisiana, that, summer, that, group, found, the, federal, government, would, not, respond, to, requests, to, enforce, the, provisions, of, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, or, to, protect, the, lives, of, activists, who, challenged, segregation, the, louisiana, campaign, survived, by, relying, on, a, local, african, american, militia, called, the, deacons, for, defense, and, justice, who, used, arms, to, repel, white, supremacist, violence, and, police, repression, core, s, collaboration, with, the, deacons, was, effective, in, disrupting, jim, crow, in, numerous, louisiana, areas, in, 1965, sncc, helped, organize, an, independent, political, party, the, lowndes, county, freedom, organization, lcfo, in, the, heart, of, the, alabama, black, belt, also, klan, territory, it, permitted, its, black, leaders, to, openly, promote, the, use, of, armed, self, defense, meanwhile, the, deacons, for, defense, and, justice, expanded, into, mississippi, and, assisted, charles, evers, naacp, chapter, with, a, successful, campaign, in, natchez, charles, had, taken, the, lead, after, his, brother, medgar, evers, was, assassinated, in, 1963, the, same, year, the, 1965, watts, rebellion, took, place, in, los, angeles, many, black, youths, were, committed, to, the, use, of, violence, to, protest, inequality, and, oppression, during, the, march, against, fear, in, 1966, initiated, by, james, meredith, sncc, and, core, fully, embraced, the, slogan, of, black, power, to, describe, these, trends, towards, militancy, and, self, reliance, in, mississippi, stokely, carmichael, declared, i, m, not, going, to, beg, the, white, man, for, anything, that, i, deserve, i, m, going, to, take, it, we, need, power, some, people, engaging, in, the, black, power, movement, claimed, a, growing, sense, of, black, pride, and, identity, in, gaining, more, of, a, sense, of, a, cultural, identity, blacks, demanded, that, whites, no, longer, refer, to, them, as, negroes, but, as, afro, americans, similar, to, other, ethnic, groups, such, as, irish, americans, and, italian, americans, until, the, mid, 1960s, blacks, had, dressed, similarly, to, whites, and, often, straightened, their, hair, as, a, part, of, affirming, their, identity, blacks, started, to, wear, african, based, dashikis, and, grow, their, hair, out, as, a, natural, afro, the, afro, sometimes, nicknamed, the, fro, remained, a, popular, black, hairstyle, until, the, late, 1970s, other, variations, of, traditional, african, styles, have, become, popular, often, featuring, braids, extensions, and, dreadlocks, the, black, panther, party, bpp, which, was, founded, by, huey, newton, and, bobby, seale, in, oakland, california, in, 1966, gained, the, most, attention, for, black, power, nationally, the, group, began, following, the, revolutionary, pan, africanism, of, late, period, malcolm, x, using, a, by, any, means, necessary, approach, to, stopping, racial, inequality, they, sought, to, rid, african, american, neighborhoods, of, police, brutality, and, to, establish, socialist, community, control, in, the, ghettos, while, they, conducted, armed, confrontation, with, police, they, also, set, up, free, breakfast, and, healthcare, programs, for, children, between, 1968, and, 1971, the, bpp, was, one, of, the, most, important, black, organizations, in, the, country, and, had, support, from, the, naacp, sclc, peace, and, freedom,

prison, guard, was, found, not, guilty, of, shooting, and, killing, three, black, prisoners, from, the, prison, tower, they, retaliated, by, killing, a, white, prison, guard, numerous, popular,

long, march, from, belfast, to, derry, which, was, inspired, by, the, selma, to, montgomery, marches, during, the, civil, rights, movement, in, northern, ireland, protesters, often, sang, the,

argued, that, this, was, a, major, factor, in, moving, the, government, to, support, civil, rights, legislation, a, majority, of, white, southerners, have, been, estimated, to, have, neither, supported, nor, resisted, the, civil, rights, movement, many, did, not, enjoy, the, idea, of, expanding, civil, rights, but, were, uncomfortable, with, the, language, and, often, violent, tactics, used, by, those, who, resisted, the, civil, rights, movement, as, part, of, the, massive, resistance, many, only, reacted, to, the, movement, once, forced, to, by, their, changing, environment, and, when, they, did, their, response, was, usually, whatever, they, felt, would, disturb, their, daily, life, the, least, most, of, their, personal, reactions, whether, eventually, in, support, or,
