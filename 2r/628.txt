ur, r, oor, was, an, important, sumerian, city, state, in, ancient, mesopotamia, located, at, the, site, of, modern, tell, el, muqayyar, arabic, lit, mound, of, bitumen, in, dhi, qar, governorate, southern, iraq, although, ur, was, once, a, coastal, city, near, the, mouth, of, the, euphrates, on, the, persian, gulf, the, coastline, has, shifted, and, the, city, is, now, well, inland, on, the, south, bank, of, the, euphrates, 16, km, 10, mi, from, nasiriyah, in, modern, day, iraq, the, city, dates, from, the, ubaid, period, c, 3800, bc, and, is, recorded, in, written, history, as, a, city, state, from, the, 26th, century, bc, its, first, recorded, king, being, king, tuttues, the, city, s, patron, deity, was, nanna, in, akkadian, sin, the, sumerian, and, akkadian, moon, god, and, the, name, of, the, city, is, in, origin, derived, from, the, god, s, name, unug, ki, literally, the, abode, unug, of, nanna, the, site, is, marked, by, the, partially, restored, ruins, of, the, ziggurat, of, ur, which, contained, the, shrine, of, nanna, excavated, in, the, 1930s, the, temple, was, built, in, the, 21st, century, bc, short, chronology, during, the, reign, of, ur, nammu, and, was, reconstructed, in, the, 6th, century, bc, by, nabonidus, the, last, king, of, babylon, archaeological, discoveries, have, shown, unequivocally, that, ur, was, a, major, sumerian, urban, center, on, the, mesopotamian, plain, especially, the, discovery, of, the, royal, tombs, has, confirmed, its, splendour, these, tombs, which, date, to, the, early, dynastic, iiia, period, approximately, in, the, 25th, or, 24th, century, bc, contained, an, immense, treasure, of, luxury, items, made, of, precious, metals, and, semi, precious, stones, imported, from, long, distances, ancient, iran, afghanistan, india, asia, minor, the, levant, and, the, persian, gulf, this, wealth, unparalleled, up, to, then, is, a, testimony, of, ur, s, economic, importance, during, the, early, bronze, age, excavation, in, the, old, city, of, ur, in, 1929, revealed, the, lyres, of, ur, instruments, similar, to, the, modern, harp, but, in, the, shape, of, a, bull, and, with, eleven, strings, when, ur, was, founded, the, persian, gulf, s, water, level, was, two, and, a, half, metres, higher, than, today, ur, is, thought, therefore, to, have, had, marshy, surroundings, irrigation, would, have, been, unnecessary, and, the, city, s, evident, canals, likely, were, used, for, transportation, fish, birds, tubers, and, reeds, might, have, supported, ur, economically, without, the, need, for, an, agricultural, revolution, sometimes, hypothesized, as, a, prerequisite, to, urbanization, archaeologists, have, discovered, evidence, of, early, occupation, at, ur, during, the, ubaid, period, c, 5500, 3700, bc, a, prehistoric, period, of, mesopotamia, the, name, derives, from, tell, al, ubaid, where, the, earliest, large, excavation, of, ubaid, period, material, was, conducted, initially, in, 1919, by, henry, hall, and, later, by, leonard, woolley, later, a, layer, of, soil, covered, the, occupation, levels, from, the, ubaid, period, excavators, of, the, 1920s, interpreted, the, layer, of, soil, as, evidence, for, the, great, flood, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, and, book, of, genesis, it, is, now, understood, that, the, south, mesopotamian, plain, was, exposed, to, regular, floods, from, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, rivers, with, heavy, erosion, from, water, and, wind, which, may, have, given, rise, to, the, mesopotamian, and, derivative, biblical, great, flood, stories, there, are, various, main, sources, informing, scholars, about, the, importance, of, ur, during, the, early, bronze, age, proto, cuneiform, tablets, from, the, early, dynastic, period, c, 2900, bc, have, been, recovered, the, first, dynasty, of, ur, seems, to, have, had, great, wealth, and, power, as, shown, by, the, lavish, remains, of, the, royal, cemetery, at, ur, the, sumerian, king, list, provides, a, tentative, political, history, of, ancient, sumer, and, mentions, among, others, several, rulers, of, ur, mesannepada, is, the, first, king, mentioned, in, the, sumerian, king, list, and, appears, to, have, lived, in, the, 26th, century, bc, that, ur, was, an, important, urban, centre, already, then, seems, to, be, indicated, by, a, type, of, cylinder, seal, called, the, city, seals, these, seals, contain, a, set, of, proto, cuneiform, signs, which, appear, to, be, writings, or, symbols, of, the, name, of, city, states, in, ancient, mesopotamia, many, of, these, seals, have, been, found, in, ur, and, the, name, of, ur, is, prominent, on, them, ur, came, under, the, control, of, the, semitic, speaking, akkadian, empire, founded, by, sargon, the, great, between, the, 24th, and, 22nd, centuries, bc, this, was, a, period, when, the, semitic, speaking, akkadians, who, had, entered, mesopotamia, in, approximately, 3000, bc, gained, ascendancy, over, the, sumerians, and, indeed, much, of, the, ancient, near, east, after, a, short, period, of, chaos, following, the, fall, of, the, akkadian, empire, the, third, ur, dynasty, was, established, when, the, king, ur, nammu, came, to, power, ruling, between, c, 2047, bc, and, 2030, bc, during, his, rule, temples, including, the, ziggurat, of, ur, were, built, and, agriculture, was, improved, through, irrigation, his, code, of, laws, the, code, of, ur, nammu, a, fragment, was, identified, in, istanbul, in, 1952, is, one, of, the, oldest, such, documents, known, preceding, the, code, of, hammurabi, by, 300, years, he, and, his, successor, shulgi, were, both, deified, during, their, reigns, and, after, his, death, he, continued, as, a, hero, figure, one, of, the, surviving, works, of, sumerian, literature, describes, the, death, of, ur, nammu, and, his, journey, to, the, underworld, ur, nammu, was, succeeded, by, shulgi, the, greatest, king, of, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, who, solidified, the, hegemony, of, ur, and, reformed, the, empire, into, a, highly, centralized, bureaucratic, state, shulgi, ruled, for, a, long, time, at, least, 42, years, and, deified, himself, halfway, through, his, rule, the, ur, empire, continued, through, the, reigns, of, three, more, kings, with, semitic, akkadian, names, amar, sin, shu, sin, and, ibbi, sin, it, fell, around, 1940, bc, to, the, elamites, in, the, 24th, regnal, year, of, ibbi, sin, an, event, commemorated, by, the, lament, for, ur, according, to, one, estimate, ur, was, the, largest, city, in, the, world, from, c, 2030, to, 1980, bc, its, population, was, approximately, 65, 000, or, 0, 1, per, cent, share, of, global, population, then, the, city, of, ur, lost, its, political, power, after, the, demise, of, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, nevertheless, its, important, position, which, kept, on, providing, access, to, the, persian, gulf, ensured, the, ongoing, economic, importance, of, the, city, during, the, second, millennium, bc, the, city, came, to, be, ruled, by, the, amorite, first, dynasty, of, babylon, which, rose, to, prominence, in, southern, mesopotamia, in, the, 19th, century, bc, during, the, old, babylonian, empire, in, the, reign, of, samsu, iluna, ur, was, abandoned, it, later, became, a, part, of, the, native, sealand, dynasty, for, several, centuries, it, then, came, under, the, control, of, the, kassites, in, the, 16th, century, bc, and, sporadically, under, the, control, of, the, middle, assyrian, empire, between, the, 14th, and, 11th, centuries, bc, the, city, along, with, the, rest, of, southern, mesopotamia, and, much, of, the, near, east, asia, minor, north, africa, and, southern, caucasus, fell, to, the, north, mesopotamian, neo, assyrian, empire, from, the, 10th, to, late, 7th, centuries, bc, from, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, bc, ur, was, ruled, by, the, so, called, chaldean, dynasty, of, babylon, in, the, 6th, century, bc, there, was, new, construction, in, ur, under, the, rule, of, nebuchadnezzar, ii, of, babylon, the, last, babylonian, king, nabonidus, improved, the, ziggurat, however, the, city, started, to, decline, from, around, 530, bc, after, babylonia, fell, to, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, and, was, no, longer, inhabited, by, the, early, 5th, century, bc, the, demise, of, ur, was, perhaps, owing, to, drought, changing, river, patterns, and, the, silting, of, the, outlet, to, the, persian, gulf, ur, is, possibly, the, city, of, ur, kasdim, mentioned, in, the, book, of, genesis, as, the, birthplace, of, the, jewish, and, muslim, patriarch, abraham, avraham, in, hebrew, ibrahim, in, arabic, traditionally, believed, to, have, lived, some, time, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, there, are, however, conflicting, traditions, and, scholarly, opinions, identifying, ur, kasdim, with, the, sites, of, anl, urfa, urkesh, urartu, or, kutha, the, biblical, ur, is, mentioned, four, times, in, the, torah, or, hebrew, bible, tanakh, in, hebrew, with, the, distinction, of, the, kasdim, kasdin, traditionally, rendered, in, english, as, ur, of, the, chaldees, the, chaldeans, had, settled, in, the, vicinity, by, around, 850, bc, but, were, not, extant, anywhere, in, mesopotamia, during, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, period, when, abraham, is, traditionally, held, to, have, lived, the, chaldean, dynasty, did, not, rule, babylonia, and, thus, become, the, rulers, of, ur, until, the, late, 7th, century, bc, and, held, power, only, until, the, mid, 6th, century, bc, the, name, is, found, in, genesis, 11, 28, genesis, 11, 31, and, genesis, 15, 7, in, nehemiah, 9, 7, a, single, passage, mentioning, ur, is, a, paraphrase, of, genesis, pope, john, paul, ii, wanted, to, visit, the, city, according, to, the, biblical, tradition, as, part, of, his, trip, to, israel, jordan, and, the, palestinian, territories, but, the, visit, was, cancelled, due, to, a, dispute, between, the, government, of, saddam, hussein, and, representatives, of, the, holy, see, in, march, 2021, pope, francis, visited, ur, during, his, journey, through, iraq, the, site, consists, of, a, mound, roughly, 1200, by, 800, meters, with, a, height, of, about, 20, meters, above, the, plan, the, mound, is, split, by, the, remnants, of, an, ancient, canal, into, north, and, south, portions, the, remains, of, a, city, wall, are, visible, surrounding, the, site, the, occupation, size, ranged, from, about, 15, hectares, in, the, jemdet, nasr, period, to, 90, hectares, in, the, early, dynastic, period, and, then, peaking, in, the, ur, iii, period, at, 108, hectares, and, the, isin, larsa, period, at, 140, hectares, extending, beyond, the, city, walls, subsequent, period, had, varying, lesser, degrees, of, occupation, in, 1625, the, site, was, visited, by, pietro, della, valle, who, recorded, the, presence, of, ancient, bricks, stamped, with, strange, symbols, cemented, together, with, bitumen, as, well, as, inscribed, pieces, of, black, marble, that, appeared, to, be, seals, he, retrieved, several, inscribed, bricks, european, archaeologists, did, not, identify, tell, el, muqayyar, as, the, site, of, ur, until, henry, rawlinson, successfully, deciphered, some, bricks, from, that, location, brought, to, england, by, william, loftus, in, 1849, the, site, was, first, excavated, in, 1853, and, 1854, on, behalf, of, the, british, museum, and, with, instructions,

these, tablets, were, inadvertently, mixed, in, with, those, excavated, at, kutalla, only, in, recent, years, has, this, error, been, recognized, typical, of, the, era, his, excavations, destroyed, information, and, exposed, the, tell, natives, used, the, now, loosened, 4, 000, year, old, bricks, and, tile, for, construction, for, the, next, 75, years, while, the, site, lay, unexplored, the, british, museum, having, decided, to, prioritize, archaeology, in, assyria, the, site, was, considered, rich, in, remains, and, relatively, easy, to, explore, after, some, soundings, were, made, during, a, week, in, 1918, by, reginald, campbell, thompson, h, r, hall, worked, the, site, for, one, season, using, 70, turkish, prisoners, of, war, for, the, british, museum, in, 1919, laying, the,

could, find, anything, that, would, allow, them, to, keep, digging, they, split, into, two, teams, a, and, team, b, both, teams, spent, the, first, few, months, digging, a, trench, and, found, evidence, of, burial, grounds, by, collecting, small, pieces, of, golden, jewelry, and, pottery, this, was, called, the, gold, trench, after, the, first, season, of, digging, finished, woolley,

blows, to, the, head, that, could, be, from, the, spiked, end, of, a, copper, axe, which, showed, woolley, s, initial, theory, of, mass, suicide, via, poison, to, be, incorrect, inside, puabi, s, tomb, there, was, a, chest, in, the, middle, of, the, room, underneath, that, chest, was, a, hole, in, the, ground, that, led, to, what, was, called, the, king, s, grave, pg, 789, it, was, believed,
