the, first, human, inhabitants, of, the, japanese, archipelago, have, been, traced, to, the, paleolithic, around, 38, 39, 000, years, ago, the, j, mon, period, named, after, its, cord, marked, pottery, was, followed, by, the, yayoi, period, in, the, first, millennium, bc, when, new, inventions, were, introduced, from, asia, during, this, period, the, first, known, written, reference, to, japan, was, recorded, in, the, chinese, book, of, han, in, the, first, century, ad, around, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, yayoi, people, from, the, continent, immigrated, to, the, japanese, archipelago, and, introduced, iron, technology, and, agricultural, civilization, because, they, had, an, agricultural, civilization, the, population, of, the, yayoi, began, to, grow, rapidly, and, ultimately, overwhelmed, the, j, mon, people, natives, of, the, japanese, archipelago, who, were, hunter, gatherers, between, the, fourth, and, ninth, centuries, japan, s, many, kingdoms, and, tribes, gradually, came, to, be, unified, under, a, centralized, government, nominally, controlled, by, the, emperor, of, japan, the, imperial, dynasty, established, at, this, time, continues, to, this, day, albeit, in, an, almost, entirely, ceremonial, role, in, 794, a, new, imperial, capital, was, established, at, heian, ky, modern, kyoto, marking, the, beginning, of, the, heian, period, which, lasted, until, 1185, the, heian, period, is, considered, a, golden, age, of, classical, japanese, culture, japanese, religious, life, from, this, time, and, onwards, was, a, mix, of, native, shinto, practices, and, buddhism, over, the, following, centuries, the, power, of, the, imperial, house, decreased, passing, first, to, great, clans, of, civilian, aristocrats, most, notably, the, fujiwara, and, then, to, the, military, clans, and, their, armies, of, samurai, the, minamoto, clan, under, minamoto, no, yoritomo, emerged, victorious, from, the, genpei, war, of, 1180, 85, defeating, their, rival, military, clan, the, taira, after, seizing, power, yoritomo, set, up, his, capital, in, kamakura, and, took, the, title, of, sh, gun, in, 1274, and, 1281, the, kamakura, shogunate, withstood, two, mongol, invasions, but, in, 1333, it, was, toppled, by, a, rival, claimant, to, the, shogunate, ushering, in, the, muromachi, period, during, this, period, regional, warlords, called, daimy, grew, in, power, at, the, expense, of, the, sh, gun, eventually, japan, descended, into, a, period, of, civil, war, over, the, course, of, the, late, 16th, century, japan, was, reunified, under, the, leadership, of, the, prominent, daimy, oda, nobunaga, and, his, successor, toyotomi, hideyoshi, after, toyotomi, s, death, in, 1598, tokugawa, ieyasu, came, to, power, and, was, appointed, sh, gun, by, the, emperor, the, tokugawa, shogunate, which, governed, from, edo, modern, tokyo, presided, over, a, prosperous, and, peaceful, era, known, as, the, edo, period, 1600, 1868, the, tokugawa, shogunate, imposed, a, strict, class, system, on, japanese, society, and, cut, off, almost, all, contact, with, the, outside, world, portugal, and, japan, came, into, contact, in, 1543, when, the, portuguese, became, the, first, europeans, to, reach, japan, by, landing, in, the, southern, archipelago, they, had, a, significant, impact, on, japan, even, in, this, initial, limited, interaction, introducing, firearms, to, japanese, warfare, the, american, perry, expedition, in, 1853, 54, more, completely, ended, japan, s, seclusion, this, contributed, to, the, fall, of, the, shogunate, and, the, return, of, power, to, the, emperor, during, the, boshin, war, in, 1868, the, new, national, leadership, of, the, following, meiji, era, 1868, 1912, transformed, the, isolated, feudal, island, country, into, an, empire, that, closely, followed, western, models, and, became, a, great, power, although, democracy, developed, and, modern, civilian, culture, prospered, during, the, taish, period, 1912, 1926, japan, s, powerful, military, had, great, autonomy, and, overruled, japan, s, civilian, leaders, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, the, japanese, military, invaded, manchuria, in, 1931, and, from, 1937, the, conflict, escalated, into, a, prolonged, war, with, china, japan, s, attack, on, pearl, harbor, in, 1941, led, to, war, with, the, united, states, and, its, allies, japan, s, forces, soon, became, overextended, but, the, military, held, out, in, spite, of, allied, air, attacks, that, inflicted, severe, damage, on, population, centers, emperor, hirohito, announced, japan, s, surrender, on, 15, august, 1945, following, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, and, the, soviet, invasion, of, manchuria, the, allies, occupied, japan, until, 1952, during, which, a, new, constitution, was, enacted, in, 1947, that, transformed, japan, into, the, constitutional, monarchy, and, parliamentary, democracy, it, is, today, after, 1955, japan, enjoyed, very, high, economic, growth, under, the, governance, of, the, liberal, democratic, party, and, became, a, world, economic, powerhouse, since, the, lost, decade, of, the, 1990s, japanese, economic, growth, has, slowed, hunter, gatherers, arrived, in, japan, in, paleolithic, times, with, the, oldest, evidence, dating, to, around, 38, 40, 000, years, ago, little, evidence, of, their, presence, remains, as, japan, s, acidic, soils, tend, to, degrade, bone, remains, however, the, discovery, of, unique, edge, ground, axes, in, japan, dated, to, over, 30, 000, years, ago, may, be, evidence, of, the, first, homo, sapiens, in, japan, early, humans, likely, arrived, in, japan, by, sea, on, watercraft, evidence, of, human, habitation, has, been, dated, to, 32, 000, years, ago, in, okinawa, s, yamashita, cave, and, up, to, 20, 000, years, ago, on, ishigaki, island, s, shiraho, saonetabaru, cave, evidence, has, been, found, suggesting, that, japan, s, paleolithic, inhabitants, interacted, with, and, butchered, now, extinct, megafauna, including, the, elephant, palaeoloxodon, naumanni, and, the, giant, deer, sinomegaceros, yabei, the, j, mon, period, of, prehistoric, japan, spans, from, roughly, 13, 000, bc, to, about, 1, 000, bc, japan, was, inhabited, by, a, predominantly, hunter, gatherer, culture, that, reached, a, considerable, degree, of, sedentism, and, cultural, complexity, the, name, j, mon, meaning, cord, marked, was, first, applied, by, american, scholar, edward, s, morse, who, discovered, shards, of, pottery, in, 1877, the, pottery, style, characteristic, of, the, first, phases, of, j, mon, culture, was, decorated, by, impressing, cords, into, the, surface, of, wet, clay, j, mon, pottery, is, generally, accepted, to, be, among, the, oldest, in, east, asia, and, the, world, the, advent, of, the, yayoi, people, from, the, asian, mainland, brought, fundamental, transformations, to, the, japanese, archipelago, the, millennial, achievements, of, the, neolithic, revolution, took, hold, of, the, islands, in, a, relatively, short, span, of, centuries, particularly, with, the, development, of, rice, cultivation, and, metallurgy, until, recently, the, onset, of, this, wave, of, cultural, and, technological, changes, was, thought, to, have, begun, around, 400, bc, radio, carbon, evidence, now, suggests, that, the, new, phase, started, some, 500, years, earlier, between, 1, 000, and, 800, bc, endowed, with, bronze, and, iron, weapons, and, tools, initially, imported, from, china, and, the, korean, peninsula, the, yayoi, radiated, out, from, northern, ky, sh, gradually, supplanting, the, j, mon, they, also, introduced, weaving, and, silk, production, new, woodworking, methods, glassmaking, technology, and, new, architectural, styles, the, expansion, of, the, yayoi, appears, to, have, brought, about, a, fusion, with, the, indigenous, j, mon, resulting, in, a, small, genetic, admixture, these, yayoi, technologies, originated, on, the, asian, mainland, there, is, debate, among, scholars, as, to, what, degree, their, spread, can, be, attributed, to, migration, or, to, cultural, diffusion, the, migration, theory, is, supported, by, genetic, and, linguistic, studies, historian, hanihara, kazur, has, suggested, that, the, annual, immigrant, influx, from, the, continent, range, from, 350, to, 3, 000, the, population, of, japan, began, to, increase, rapidly, perhaps, with, a, 10, fold, rise, over, the, j, mon, calculations, of, the, increasing, population, size, by, the, end, of, the, yayoi, period, have, varied, from, 1, to, 4, million, skeletal, remains, from, the, late, j, mon, period, reveal, a, deterioration, in, already, poor, standards, of, health, and, nutrition, whereas, contemporaneous, yayoi, archaeological, sites, possess, large, structures, suggestive, of, grain, storehouses, this, shift, was, accompanied, by, an, increase, in, both, the, stratification, of, society, and, tribal, warfare, indicated, by, segregated, gravesites, and, military, fortifications, during, the, yayoi, period, the, yayoi, tribes, gradually, coalesced, into, a, number, of, kingdoms, the, earliest, written, work, to, unambiguously, mention, japan, the, book, of, han, published, in, 111, ad, states, that, one, hundred, kingdoms, comprised, japan, which, is, referred, to, as, wa, a, later, chinese, work, of, history, the, book, of, wei, states, that, by, 240, ad, the, powerful, kingdom, of, yamatai, ruled, by, the, female, monarch, himiko, had, gained, ascendancy, over, the, others, though, modern, historians, continue, to, debate, its, location, and, other, aspects, of, its, depiction, in, the, book, of, wei, during, the, subsequent, kofun, period, japan, gradually, unified, under, a, single, territory, the, symbol, of, the, growing, power, of, japan, s, new, leaders, was, the, kofun, burial, mounds, they, constructed, from, around, 250, ad, onwards, many, were, of, massive, scale, such, as, the, daisenry, kofun, a, 486, m, long, keyhole, shaped, burial, mound, that, took, huge, teams, of, laborers, fifteen, years, to, complete, it, is, commonly, accepted, that, the, tomb, was, built, for, emperor, nintoku, the, kofun, were, often, surrounded, by, and, filled, with, numerous, haniwa, clay, sculptures, often, in, the, shape, of, warriors, and, horses, the, center, of, the, unified, state, was, yamato, in, the, kinai, region, of, central, japan, the, rulers, of, the, yamato, state, were, a, hereditary, line, of, emperors, who, still, reign, as, the, world, s, longest, dynasty, the, rulers, of, the, yamato, extended, their, power, across, japan, through, military, conquest, but, their, preferred, method, of, expansion, was, to, convince, local, leaders, to, accept, their, authority, in, exchange, for, positions, of, influence, in, the, government, many, of, the, powerful, local, clans, who, joined, the, yamato, state, became, known, as, the, uji, these, leaders, sought, and, received, formal, diplomatic, recognition, from, china, and, chinese, accounts, record, five, successive, such, leaders, as, the, five, kings, of, wa, craftsmen, and, scholars, from, china, and, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, played, an, important, role, in, transmitting, continental, technologies, and, administrative, skills, to, japan, during, this, period, historians, agree, that, there, was, a, big, struggle, between, the, yamato, federation, and, the, izumo, federation, centuries, before, written, records, the, asuka, period, began, as, early, as, 538, ad, with, the, introduction, of, the, buddhist, religion, from, the, korean, kingdom, of, baekje, since, then, buddhism, has, coexisted, with, japan, s, native, shinto, religion, in, what, is, today, known, as, shinbutsu, sh, g, the, period, draws, its,

sun, addresses, the, ruler, of, the, land, of, the, setting, sun, as, seen, in, the, kanji, characters, for, japan, nippon, by, 670, a, variant, of, this, expression, nihon, established, itself, as, the, official, name, of, the, nation, which, has, persisted, to, this, day, in, 645, the, soga, clan, were, overthrown, in, a, coup, launched, by, prince, naka, no, e, and, fujiwara, no, kamatari,

philosophies, from, china, it, nationalized, all, land, in, japan, to, be, distributed, equally, among, cultivators, and, ordered, the, compilation, of, a, household, registry, as, the, basis, for, a, new, system, of, taxation, the, true, aim, of, the, reforms, was, to, bring, about, greater, centralization, and, to, enhance, the, power, of, the, imperial, court, which, was, also, based, on, the, governmental, structure, of, china, envoys, and, students, were, dispatched, to, china, to, learn, about, chinese, writing, politics, art, and, religion, after, the, reforms, the, jinshin, war, of, 672, a, bloody, conflict, between, prince, ama, and, his, nephew, prince, tomo, two, rivals, to, the, throne, became, a, major, catalyst, for, further, administrative, reforms, these, reforms, culminated, with, the, promulgation, of, the, taih, code, which, consolidated, existing, statutes, and, established, the, structure, of, the, central, government, and, its, subordinate, local, governments, these, legal, reforms, created, the, ritsury, state, a, system, of, chinese, style, centralized, government, that, remained, in, place, for, half, a, millennium, the, art, of, the, asuka, period, embodies, the, themes, of, buddhist, art, one, of, the, most, famous, works, is, the, buddhist, temple, of, h, ry, ji, commissioned, by, prince, sh, toku, and, completed, in, 607, ad, it, is,

chinese, tang, dynasty, during, this, period, the, first, two, books, produced, in, japan, appeared, the, kojiki, and, nihon, shoki, which, contain, chronicles, of, legendary, accounts, of, early, japan, and, its, creation, myth, which, describes, the, imperial, line, as, descendants, of, the, gods, the, man, y, sh, was, compiled, in, the, latter, half, of, the, eighth, century, which, is, widely, considered, the, finest, collection, of, japanese, poetry, during, this, period, japan, suffered, a, series, of, natural, disasters, including, wildfires, droughts, famines, and, outbreaks, of, disease, such, as, a, smallpox, epidemic, in, 735, 737, that, killed, over, a, quarter, of, the, population, emperor, sh, mu, r, 724, 749, feared, his, lack, of, piousness, had, caused, the,

grandson, antoku, as, emperor, the, outcome, of, this, war, led, to, the, rivalry, between, the, minamoto, and, taira, clans, as, a, result, the, dispute, and, power, struggle, between, both, clans, led, to, the, heiji, rebellion, in, 1160, in, 1180, taira, no, kiyomori, was, challenged, by, an, uprising, led, by, minamoto, no, yoritomo, a, member, of, the, minamoto, clan, whom, kiyomori, had, exiled, to, kamakura, though, taira, no, kiyomori, died, in, 1181, the, ensuing, bloody, genpei, war, between, the, taira, and, minamoto, families, continued, for, another, four, years, the, victory, of, the, minamoto, clan, was, sealed, in, 1185, when, a, force, commanded, by, yoritomo, s, younger, brother, minamoto, no, yoshitsune, scored, a, decisive, victory, at, the, naval, battle, of, dan,

part, of, a, general, trend, of, declining, chinese, influence, during, the, heian, period, the, official, japanese, missions, to, tang, dynasty, of, china, which, began, in, the, year, 630, ended, during, the, ninth, century, though, informal, missions, of, monks, and, scholars, continued, and, thereafter, the, development, of, native, japanese, forms, of, art, and, poetry, accelerated, a,

the, court, maintained, bureaucratic, and, religious, functions, and, the, shogunate, welcomed, participation, by, members, of, the, aristocratic, class, the, older, institutions, remained, intact, in, a, weakened, form, and, kyoto, remained, the, official, capital, this, system, has, been, contrasted, with, the, simple, warrior, rule, of, the, later, muromachi, period, yoritomo, soon, turned, on, yoshitsune, who, was, initially, harbored, by, fujiwara, no, hidehira, the, grandson, of, kiyohira, and, the, de, facto, ruler, of, northern, honshu, in, 1189, after, hidehira, s, death, his, successor, yasuhira, attempted, to, curry, favor, with, yoritomo, by, attacking, yoshitsune, s, home, although, yoshitsune, was, killed, yoritomo, still, invaded, and, conquered, the, northern, fujiwara, clan, s, territories, in, subsequent, centuries, yoshitsune, would, become, a, legendary, figure, portrayed, in, countless, works, of, literature, as, an, idealized, tragic, hero, after, yoritomo, s, death, in, 1199, the, office, of, shogun, weakened, behind, the, scenes, yoritomo, s, wife, h, j, masako, became, the, true, power, behind, the, government, in, 1203, her, father, h, j,

depleted, its, finances, that, it, was, unable, to, provide, compensation, to, its, vassals, for, their, role, in, the, victory, this, had, permanent, negative, consequences, for, the, shogunate, s, relations, with, the, samurai, class, discontent, among, the, samurai, proved, decisive, in, ending, the, kamakura, shogunate, in, 1333, emperor, go, daigo, launched, a, rebellion, in, the, hope, of,

court, takauji, set, up, his, shogunate, in, the, muromachi, district, of, kyoto, however, the, shogunate, was, faced, with, the, twin, challenges, of, fighting, the, southern, court, and, of, maintaining, its, authority, over, its, own, subordinate, governors, like, the, kamakura, shogunate, the, muromachi, shogunate, appointed, its, allies, to, rule, in, the, provinces, but, these, men, increasingly, styled, themselves, as, feudal, lords, called, daimy, s, of, their, domains, and, often, refused, to, obey, the, shogun, the, ashikaga, shogun, who, was, most, successful, at, bringing, the, country, together, was, takauji, s, grandson, ashikaga, yoshimitsu, who, came, to, power, in, 1368, and, remained, influential, until, his, death, in, 1408, yoshimitsu, expanded, the, power, of,

under, tight, control, during, the, final, century, of, the, ashikaga, shogunate, the, country, descended, into, another, more, violent, period, of, civil, war, this, started, in, 1467, when, the, nin, war, broke, out, over, who, would, succeed, the, ruling, shogun, the, daimy, s, each, took, sides, and, burned, kyoto, to, the, ground, while, battling, for, their, preferred, candidate, by, the, time, the, succession, was, settled, in, 1477, the, shogun, had, lost, all, power, over, the, daimy, who, now, ruled, hundreds, of, independent, states, throughout, japan, during, this, warring, states, period, daimy, s, fought, among, themselves, for, control, of, the, country, some, of, the, most, powerful, daimy, s, of, the, era, were, uesugi, kenshin, and, takeda, shingen, one, enduring, symbol, of, this, era, was, the, ninja, skilled, spies, and, assassins, hired, by, daimy, s, few, definite, historical, facts, are, known, about, the, secretive, lifestyles, of, the, ninja, who, became, the, subject, of, many, legends, in, addition, to, the, daimy, s, rebellious, peasants, and, warrior, monks, affiliated, with, buddhist, temples, also, raised, their, own, armies, amid, this,

of, tomo, s, rin, but, in, 1562, they, moved, to, yokoseura, when, the, daimy, there, omura, sumitada, offered, to, be, the, first, lord, to, convert, to, christianity, adopting, the, name, of, dom,

as, mura, sumitada, guaranteed, a, little, land, in, the, small, fishing, village, of, nagas, qui, to, the, jesuits, who, divided, it, into, six, areas, they, could, use, the, land, to, receive, christians, exiled, from, other, territories, as, well, as, for, portuguese, merchants, the, jesuits, built, a, chapel, and, a, school, under, the, name, of, s, o, paulo, like, those, in, goa, and,

sumitada, dom, bartolomeu, decided, to, guarantee, the, city, directly, to, the, jesuits, in, 1580, after, a, few, years, the, jesuits, came, to, realize, that, if, they, understood, the, language, they, would, achieve, more, conversions, to, the, catholic, religion, jesuits, such, as, jo, o, rodrigues, wrote, a, japanese, dictionary, thus, portuguese, became, the, first, western, language, to, have, such, a, dictionary, when, it, was, published, in, nagasaki, in, 1603, in, spite, of, the, war, japan, s, relative, economic, prosperity, which, had, begun, in, the, kamakura, period, continued,

currency, based, economy, during, the, period, some, of, japan, s, most, representative, art, forms, developed, including, ink, wash, painting, ikebana, flower, arrangement, the, tea, ceremony, japanese, gardening, bonsai, and, noh, theater, though, the, eighth, ashikaga, shogun, yoshimasa, was, an, ineffectual, political, and, military, leader, he, played, a, critical, role, in, promoting, these, cultural, developments, he, had, the, famous, kinkaku, ji, or, temple, of, the, golden, pavilion, built, in, kyoto, in, 1397, during, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, japan,

with, innovative, tactics, he, promoted, talented, men, regardless, of, their, social, status, including, his, peasant, servant, toyotomi, hideyoshi, who, became, one, of, his, best, generals, the, azuchi, momoyama, period, began, in, 1568, when, nobunaga, seized, kyoto, and, thus, effectively, brought, an, end, to, the, ashikaga, shogunate, he, was, well, on, his, way, towards, his, goal, of, reuniting, all, japan, when, in, 1582, one, of, his, own, officers, akechi, mitsuhide, killed, him, during, an, abrupt, attack, on, his, encampment, hideyoshi, avenged, nobunaga, by, crushing, akechi, s, uprising, and, emerged, as, nobunaga, s, successor, hideyoshi, completed, the, reunification, of, japan, by, conquering, shikoku, kyushu, and, the, lands, of, the, h, j, family, in, eastern, japan, he, launched, sweeping, changes, to, japanese, society, including, the, confiscation, of, swords, from, the, peasantry, new, restrictions, on, daimy, s, persecutions, of, christians, a, thorough,

the, land, as, being, commoners, an, act, which, effectively, granted, freedom, to, most, of, japan, s, slaves, as, hideyoshi, s, power, expanded, he, dreamed, of, conquering, china, and, launched, two, massive, invasions, of, korea, starting, in, 1592, hideyoshi, failed, to, defeat, the, chinese, and, korean, armies, on, the, korean, peninsula, and, the, war, ended, after, his, death, in, 1598, in, the, hope, of, founding, a, new, dynasty, hideyoshi, had, asked, his, most, trusted, subordinates, to, pledge, loyalty, to, his, infant, son, toyotomi, hideyori, despite, this, almost, immediately, after, hideyoshi, s, death, war, broke, out, between, hideyori, s, allies, and, those, loyal, to, tokugawa, ieyasu, a, daimy, and, a, former, ally, of, hideyoshi, tokugawa, ieyasu, won, a, decisive, victory, at, the, battle, of, sekigahara, in, 1600, ushering, in, 268, years, of, uninterrupted, rule, by, the, tokugawa, clan, the, edo, period, was, characterized, by, relative, peace,

the, shogunate, promulgated, the, laws, for, the, military, houses, which, imposed, tighter, controls, on, the, daimy, s, and, the, alternate, attendance, system, which, required, each, daimy, to, spend, every, other, year, in, edo, even, so, the, daimy, s, continued, to, maintain, a, significant, degree, of, autonomy, in, their, domains, the, central, government, of, the, shogunate, in, edo, which, quickly, became, the, most, populous, city, in, the, world, took, counsel, from, a, group, of, senior, advisors, known, as, r, j, and, employed, samurai, as, bureaucrats, the, emperor, in, kyoto, was, funded, lavishly, by, the, government, but, was, allowed, no, political, power, the, tokugawa, shogunate, went, to, great, lengths, to, suppress, social, unrest, harsh, penalties, including, crucifixion, beheading, and, death, by, boiling, were, decreed, for, even, the, most, minor, offenses, though, criminals, of, high, social, class, were, often, given, the, option, of, seppuku, self, disembowelment, an, ancient, form, of, suicide, that, became, ritualized, christianity, which, was, seen, as, a, potential, threat, was, gradually, clamped, down, on, until, finally, after, the, christian, led, shimabara, rebellion, of, 1638, the, religion, was, completely, outlawed, to, prevent, further, foreign, ideas, from, sowing, dissent, the, third, tokugawa, shogun,

to, thirty, million, mostly, because, of, agricultural, growth, the, population, remained, stable, for, the, rest, of, the, period, the, shogunate, s, construction, of, roads, elimination, of, road, and, bridge, tolls, and, standardization, of, coinage, promoted, commercial, expansion, that, also, benefited, the, merchants, and, artisans, of, the, cities, city, populations, grew, but, almost, ninety, percent, of, the, population, continued, to, live, in, rural, areas, both, the, inhabitants, of, cities, and, of, rural, communities, would, benefit, from, one, of, the, most, notable, social, changes, of, the, edo, period, increased, literacy, and, numeracy, the, number, of, private, schools, greatly, expanded, particularly, those, attached, to, temples, and, shrines, and, raised, literacy, to, thirty, percent, this, may, have, been, the, world, s, highest, rate, at, the, time, and, drove, a, flourishing, commercial, publishing, industry, which, grew, to, produce, hundreds, of, titles, per, year, in, the, area, of, numeracy, approximated, by, an, index, measuring, people, s, ability, to, report, an, exact, rather, than, a, rounded, age, age, heaping, method, and, which, level, shows, a, strong, correlation, to, later, economic, development, of, a, country, japan, s, level, was, comparable, to, that, of, north, west, european, countries, and, moreover, japan, s, index, came, close, to, the, 100, percent, mark, throughout, the, nineteenth, century, these, high, levels, of, both, literacy, and, numeracy, were, part, of, the, socio, economical, foundation, for, japan, s, strong, growth, rates, during, the, following, century, the, edo, period, was, a, time, of, cultural, flourishing, as, the, merchant, classes, grew, in, wealth, and, began, spending, their, income, on, cultural, and, social, pursuits, members, of, the, merchant, class, who, patronized, culture, and, entertainment, were, said, to, live, hedonistic, lives, which, came, to, be, called, the,

though, they, would, not, sleep, with, them, the, tokugawas, sponsored, and, were, heavily, influenced, by, neo, confucianism, which, led, the, government, to, divide, society, into, four, classes, based, on, the, four, occupations, the, samurai, class, claimed, to, follow, the, ideology, of, bushido, literally, the, way, of, the, warrior, by, the, late, eighteenth, and, early, nineteenth, centuries, the, shogunate, showed, signs, of, weakening, the, dramatic, growth, of, agriculture, that, had, characterized, the, early, edo, period, had, ended, and, the, government, handled, the, devastating, tenp, famines, poorly, peasant, unrest, grew, and, government, revenues, fell, the, shogunate, cut, the, pay, of, the, already, financially, distressed, samurai, many, of, whom, worked, side, jobs, to, make, a, living, discontented, samurai, were, soon, to, play, a, major, role, in, engineering, the, downfall, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, at, the, same, time, the, people, drew, inspiration, from, new, ideas, and, fields, of, study, dutch, books, brought, into, japan, stimulated, interest, in, western, learning, called, rangaku, or, dutch, learning, the, physician, sugita,

developed, by, scholars, such, as, motoori, norinaga, and, hirata, atsutane, promoted, what, it, asserted, were, native, japanese, values, for, instance, it, criticized, the, chinese, style, neo, confucianism, advocated, by, the, shogunate, and, emphasized, the, emperor, s, divine, authority, which, the, shinto, faith, taught, had, its, roots, in, japan, s, mythic, past, which, was, referred, to, as, the, age, of, the, gods, the, arrival, in, 1853, of, a, fleet, of, american, ships, commanded, by, commodore, matthew, c, perry, threw, japan, into, turmoil, the, us, government, aimed, to, end, japan, s, isolationist, policies, the, shogunate, had, no, defense, against, perry, s, gunboats, and, had, to, agree, to, his, demands, that, american, ships, be, permitted, to, acquire, provisions, and, trade, at, japanese, ports, the, western, powers, imposed, what, became, known, as, unequal, treaties, on, japan, which, stipulated, that, japan, must, allow, citizens, of, these, countries, to, visit, or, reside, on, japanese, territory, and, must, not, levy, tariffs, on, their, imports, or, try, them, in, japanese, courts, the, shogunate, s, failure, to, oppose, the, western,

rescript, calling, for, an, end, to, the, tokugawa, shogunate, the, armies, of, ch, sh, and, satsuma, soon, marched, on, edo, and, the, ensuing, boshin, war, led, to, the, fall, of, the, shogunate, the, emperor, was, restored, to, nominal, supreme, power, and, in, 1869, the, imperial, family, moved, to, edo, which, was, renamed, tokyo, eastern, capital, however, the, most, powerful, men, in, the, government, were, former, samurai, from, ch, sh, and, satsuma, rather, than, the, emperor, who, was, fifteen, in, 1868, these, men, known, as, the, meiji, oligarchs, oversaw, the, dramatic, changes, japan, would, experience, during, this, period, the, leaders, of, the, meiji, government, desired, japan, to, become, a, modern, nation, state, that, could, stand, equal, to, the, western,
