are, not, seen, as, necessary, to, the, salvific, goal, of, the, early, buddhist, tradition, their, reality, is, explicitly, questioned, and, often, rejected, there, is, a, fundamental, incompatibility, between, the, notion, of, gods, and, basic, buddhist, principles, at, least, in, some, interpretations, some, buddhist, philosophers, assert, that, belief, in, an, eternal, creator, god, is, a, distraction, from, the, central, task, of, the, religious, life, within, the, astika, orthodox, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, the, samkhya, and, the, early, mimamsa, school, did, not, accept, a, creator, deity, in, their, respective, systems, the, principal, text, of, the, samkhya, school, the, samkhya, karika, was, written, by, ishvara, krishna, in, the, fourth, century, ce, by, which, time, it, was, already, a, dominant, hindu, school, the, origins, of, the, school, are, much, older, and, are, lost, in, legend, the, school, was, both, dualistic, and, atheistic, they, believed, in, a, dual, existence, of, prakriti, nature, and, purusha, consciousness, and, had, no, place, for, an, ishvara, god, in, its, system, arguing, that, the, existence, of, ishvara, cannot, be, proved, and, hence, cannot, be, admitted, to, exist, the, school, dominated, hindu, philosophy, in, its, day, but, declined, after, the, tenth, century, although, commentaries, were, still, being, written, as, late, as, the, sixteenth, century, the, foundational, text, for, the, mimamsa, school, is, the, purva, mimamsa, sutras, of, jaimini, c, third, to, first, century, bce, the, school, reached, its, height, c, 700, ce, and, for, some, time, in, the, early, middle, ages, exerted, near, dominant, influence, on, learned, hindu, thought, the, mimamsa, school, saw, their, primary, enquiry, was, into, the, nature, of, dharma, based, on, close, interpretation, of, the, vedas, its, core, tenets, were, ritualism, orthopraxy, antiasceticism, and, antimysticism, the, early, mimamsakas, believed, in, an, adrishta, unseen, that, is, the, result, of, performing, karmas, works, and, saw, no, need, for, an, ishvara, god, in, their, system, mimamsa, persists, in, some, subschools, of, hinduism, today, the, thoroughly, materialistic, and, antireligious, philosophical, c, rv, ka, also, known, as, lokayata, school, that, originated, in, india, with, the, b, rhaspatya, s, tras, final, centuries, bce, is, probably, the, most, explicitly, atheist, school, of, philosophy, in, the, region, if, not, the, world, these, ancient, schools, of, generic, skepticism, had, started, to, develop, far, earlier, than, the, mauryan, period, already, in, the, sixth, century, bce, ajita, kesakambalin, was, quoted, in, pali, scriptures, by, the, buddhists, with, whom, he, was,

known, principally, from, its, astika, and, buddhist, opponents, the, proper, aim, of, a, c, rv, kan, according, to, these, sources, was, to, live, a, prosperous, happy, productive, life, in, this, world, in, the, book, more, studies, on, the, c, rv, ka, lok, yata, cambridge, scholars, publishing, 2020, ramkrishna, bhattacharya, argues, that, there, have, been, many, varieties, of, materialist, thought, in, india, and, that, there, is, no, foundation, to, the, accusations, of, hedonism, nor, to, the, claim, that, these, schools, reject, inference, anum, na, per, se, as, a, way, of, knowledge, pram, as, the, tattvopaplavasimha, of, jayarashi, bhatta, c, 8th, century, is, sometimes, cited, as, a, surviving, carvaka, text, as, ethan, mills, does, in, three, pillars, of, skepticism, in, classical, india, nagarjuna, jayarasi, and, sri, harsa, 2018, it, has, been, claimed, that, the, school, died, out, sometime, around, the, fifteenth, century, in, the, oldest, of, the, upanishads, in, chapter, 2, of, the, brhad, ranyaka, ca, 700, bce, the, leading, theorist, y, jnavalkya, states, in, a, passage, often, referred, to, by, the, irreligious, so, i, say, after, death, there, is, no,

belief, is, that, there, is, no, hereafter, 4, 4, 60, c, rv, ka, arguments, are, also, present, in, the, oldest, sanskrit, epic, ramayana, early, parts, from, 3rd, c, bce, in, which, the, hero, rama, is, lectured, by, the, sage, javali, who, states, that, the, worship, of, gods, is, laid, down, in, the, shastras, by, clever, people, just, to, rule, over, other, people, and, make, them, submissive, and, disposed, to, charity, the, veda, philosopher, adi, shankara, ca, 790, 820, who, consolidated, the, non, dualist, advaita, vedanta, tradition, spends, several, pages, trying, to, refute, the, non, religious, schools, as, he, argues, against, unlearned, people, and, the, lokayatikas, according, to, the, historian, dag, herbj, rnsrud, the, atheist, carvaka, schools, were, present, at, the, court, of, the, muslim, born, mughal, ruler, akbar, 1542, 1605, an, inquiring, skeptic, who, believed, in, the, pursuit, of, reason, over, reliance, on, tradition, when, he, invited, philosophers, and, representatives, of, the, different, religions, to, his, new, house, of, worship, ibadat, khana, in, fatehpur, sikri, carvakas, were, present, as, well, according, to, the, chronicler, abul, fazl, 1551, 1602, those, discussing, religious, and, existential, matters, at, akbar, s, court, included, the, atheists, they, do, not, believe, in, a, god, nor, in, immaterial, substances, and, affirm, faculty, of, thought, to, result, from, the, equilibrium, of, the, aggregate, elements, they, admit, only, of, such, sciences, as, tend, to, the, promotion, of, external, order, that, is, a, knowledge, of, just, administration, and, benevolent, government, they, are, somewhat, analogous, to, the, sophists, in, their, views, and, have, written, many, works, in, reproach, of, others, herbj, rnsrud, argues, that, the, carvaka, schools, never, disappeared, in, india, and, that, the, atheist, traditions, of, india, influenced, europe, from, the, late, 16th, century, the, europeans, were, surprised, by, the, openness, and, rational, doubts, of, akbar, and, the, indians, in, pierre, de, jarric, s, histoire, 1610, based, on, the, jesuit, reports, the, mughal, emperor, is, actually, compared, to, an, atheist, himself, thus, we, see, in, this, prince, the, common, fault, of, the, atheist, who, refuses, to, make, reason, subservient, to, faith, hannah, chapelle, wojciehowski, concludes, as, follows, concerning, the, jesuit, descriptions, in, her, paper, east, west, swerves, c, rv, ka, materialism, and, akbar, s, religious, debates, at, fatehpur, sikri, 2015, the, information, they, sent, back, to, europe, was, disseminated, widely, in, both, catholic, and, protestant, countries, a, more, detailed, understanding, of, indian, philosophies, including, c, rv, ka, began, to, emerge, in, jesuit, missionary, writings, by, the, early, to, mid, seventeenth, century, the, jesuit, roberto, de, nobili, wrote, in, 1613, that, the, logaidas, lokayatas, hold, the, view, that, the, elements, themselves, are, god, some, decades, later, heinrich, roth, who, studied, sanskrit, in, agra, ca, 1654, 60, translated, the, vedantasara, by, the, influential, vedantic, commentator, sadananda, 14th, a, text, that, depicts, four, different, schools, of, the, carvaka, philosophies, wojciehowski, notes, rather, than, proclaiming, a, c, rv, ka, renaissance, in, akbar, s, court, it, would, be, safer, to, suggest, that, the, ancient, school, of, materialism, never, really, went, away, buddhism, is, sometimes, described, as, nontheistic, because, of, the, absence, of, a, creator, god, but, that, can, be, too, simplistic, a, view, the, nonadherence, to, the, notion, of, a, supreme, deity, or, a, prime, mover, is, seen, by, many, as, a, key, distinction, between, buddhism, and, other, religions, while, buddhist, traditions, do, not, deny, the, existence, of, supernatural, beings, many, are, discussed, in, buddhist, scripture, it, does, not, ascribe, powers, in, the, typical, western, sense, for, creation, salvation, or, judgement, to, the, gods, however, praying, to, enlightened, deities, is, sometimes, seen, as, leading, to, some, degree, of, spiritual, merit, buddhists, accept, the, existence, of, beings, in, higher, realms, known, as, devas, but, they, like, humans, are, said, to, be, suffering, in, samsara, and, not, particularly, wiser, than, we, are, in, fact, the, buddha, is, often, portrayed, as, a, teacher, of, the, deities, and, superior, to, them, despite, this, they, do, have, some, enlightened, devas, in, the, path, of, buddhahood, jains, see, their, tradition, as, eternal, organized, jainism, can, be, dated, back, to, mahavira, a, teacher, of, the, sixth, century, bce, and, a, contemporary, of, the, buddha, jainism, is, a, dualistic, religion, with, the, universe, made, up, of, matter, and, souls, the, universe, and, the, matter, and, souls, within, it, is, eternal, and, uncreated, and, there, is, no, omnipotent, creator, deity, in, jainism, there, are, however, gods, and, other, spirits, who, exist, within, the, universe, and, jains, believe, that, the, soul, can, attain, godhood, however, none, of, these, supernatural, beings, exercise, any, sort, of, creative, activity, or, have, the, capacity, or, ability, to, intervene, in, answers, to, prayers, in, western, classical, antiquity, theism, was, the, fundamental, belief, that, supported, the, legitimacy, of, the, state, the, polis, later, the, roman, empire, historically, any, person, who, did, not, believe, in, any, deity, supported, by, the, state, was, fair, game, to, accusations, of, atheism, a, capital, crime, charges, of, atheism, meaning, any, subversion, of, religion, were, often, used, similarly, to, charges, of, heresy, and, impiety, as, a, political, tool, to, eliminate, enemies, early, christians, were, widely, reviled, as, atheists, because, they, did, not, participate, in, the, cults, of, the, greco, roman, gods, during, the, roman, empire, christians, were, executed, for, their, rejection, of, the, pagan, deities, in, general, and, the, imperial, cult, of, ancient, rome, in, particular, when, christianity, became, the, roman, state, religion, under, theodosius, i, in, 380, heresy, became, a, punishable, offense, the, roots, of, western, philosophy, began, in, the, greek, world, in, the, sixth, century, bce, the, first, hellenic, philosophers, were, not, atheists, but, they, attempted, to, explain, the, world, in, terms, of, the, processes, of, nature, instead, of, by, mythological, accounts, thus, lightning, was, the, result, of, wind, breaking, out, and, parting, the, clouds, and, earthquakes, occurred, when, the, earth, is, considerably, altered, by, heating, and, cooling, the, early, philosophers, often, criticized, traditional, religious, notions, xenophanes, 6th, century, bce, famously, said, that, if, cows, and, horses, had, hands, then, horses, would, draw, the, forms, of, gods, like, horses, and, cows, like, cows, another, philosopher, anaxagoras, 5th, century, bce, claimed, that, the, sun, was, a, fiery, mass, larger, than, the, peloponnese, a, charge, of, impiety, was, brought, against, him, and, he, was, forced, to, flee, athens, the, first, fully, materialistic, philosophy, was, produced, by, the, atomists, leucippus, and, democritus, 5th, century, bce, who, attempted, to, explain, the, formation, and, development, of, the, world, in, terms, of, the, chance, movements, of, atoms, moving, in, infinite, space, for, political, reasons, socrates, was, accused, of, being, atheos, refusing, to, acknowledge, the, gods, recognized, by, the, state, the, athenian, public, associated, socrates, c, 470, 399, bce, with, the, trends, in, pre, socratic, philosophy, towards, naturalistic, inquiry, and, the, rejection, of, divine, explanations, for, phenomena, aristophanes, comic, play, the, clouds, performed, 423, bce, portrayed, socrates, as, teaching, his, students, that, the, traditional, greek, deities, did, not, exist, socrates, was, later, tried, and, executed, under, the, charge, of, not, believing, in, the, gods, of, the, state, and, instead, worshipping, foreign, gods, socrates, himself, vehemently, denied, the, charges, of, atheism, at, his, trial, all, the, surviving, sources, about, him, indicate, that, he, was, a, very, devout, man, who, prayed, to, the, rising, sun, and, believed, that, the, oracle, at, delphi, spoke, the, word, of, apollo, while, only, a, few, of, the, ancient, greco, roman, schools, of, philosophy, were, subject, to, accusations, of, atheism, there, were, some, individual, philosophers, who, espoused, atheist, views, the, peripatetic, philosopher, strato, of, lampsacus, did, not, believe, in, the, existence, of, gods, the, cyrenaic, philosopher, theodorus, the, atheist, c, 300, bce, is, supposed, to, have, denied, that, gods, exist, and, wrote, a, book, on, the, gods, expounding, his, views, in, the, fifth, century, bce, the, sophists, began, to, question, many, of, the, traditional, assumptions, of, greek, culture, prodicus, of, ceos, was, said, to, have, believed, that, it, was, the, things, which, were, serviceable, to, human, life, that, had, been, regarded, as, gods, and, protagoras, stated, at, the, beginning, of, a, book, that, with, regard, to, the, gods, i, am, unable, to, say, either, that, they, exist, or, do, not, exist, diagoras, of, melos, allegedly, chopped, up, a, wooden, statue, of, heracles, and, used, it, to, roast, his, lentils, and, revealed, the, secrets, of, the, eleusinian, mysteries, the, athenians, accused, him, of, impiety, and, banished, him, from, their, city, critias, was, said, as, well, to, deny, that, the, gods, existed, aristophanes, c, 448, 380, bce, known, for, his, satirical, style, wrote, in, his, play, the, knights, shrines, shrines, surely, you, don, t, believe, in, the, gods, what, s, your, argument, where, s, your, proof, the, most, important, greek, thinker, in, the, development, of, atheism, was, epicurus, c, 300, bce, drawing, on, the, ideas, of, democritus, and, the, atomists, he, espoused, a, materialistic, philosophy, according, to, which, the, universe, was, governed, by, the, laws, of, chance, without, the, need, for, divine, intervention, see, scientific, determinism, although, epicurus, still, maintained, that, the, gods, existed, he, believed, that, they, were, uninterested, in, human, affairs, the, aim, of, the, epicureans, was, to, attain, ataraxia, a, mental, state, of, being, untroubled, one, important, way, of, doing, this, was, by, exposing, fear, of, divine, wrath, as, irrational, the, epicureans, also, denied, the, existence, of, an, afterlife, and, the, need, to, fear, divine, punishment, after, death, one, of, the, most, eloquent, expressions, of, epicurean, thought, is, lucretius, on, the, nature, of, things, 1st, century, bce, in, which, he, held, that, gods, exist, but, argued, that, religious, fear, was, one, of, the, chief, causes, of, human, unhappiness, and, that, the, gods, did, not, involve, themselves, in, the, world, the, epicureans, also, denied, the, existence, of, an, afterlife, and, hence, dismissed, the, fear, of, death, epicureans, denied, being, atheists, but, their, critics, insisted, they, were, one, explanation, for, this, alleged, crypto, atheism, is, that, they, feared, persecution, and, while, they, avoided, this, their, teachings, were, controversial, and, harshly, attacked, by, some, of, the, other, schools, particularly, stoicism, and, neoplatonism, similar, to, the, epicureans, the, pyrrhonists, employed, a, tactic, to, avoid, persecution, for, atheism, in, which, they, in, conformity, with, ancestral, customs, and, laws, declared, that, the, gods, exist, and, performed, everything, which, contributes, to, their, worship, and, veneration, but, with, regard, to, philosophy, declined, to, commit, themselves, to, the, gods, existence, the, pyrrhonist, philosopher, sextus, empiricus, compiled, a, large, number, of, ancient, arguments, against, the, existence, of, gods, recommending, that, one, should, suspend, judgment, regarding, the, matter, his, large, volume, of, surviving, works, had, a, lasting, influence, on, later, philosophers, in, pre, hippocratic, times, greeks, believed, that, gods, controlled, all, aspects, of, human, existence, including, health, and, disease, one, of, the, earliest, works, that, challenged, the, religious, view, was, on, the, sacred, disease, written, about, 400, b, c, the, anonymous, author, argued, that, the, sacred, disease, of, epilepsy, has, a, natural, cause, and, that, the, idea, of, its, supposed, divine, origin, is, based, on, human, inexperience, euhemerus, c, 330, 260, bce, published, his, view, that, the, gods, were, only, the, deified, rulers, conquerors, and, founders, of, the, past, and, that, their, cults, and, religions, were, in, essence, the, continuation, of, vanished, kingdoms, and, earlier, political, structures, although, euhemerus, was, later, criticized, for, having, spread, atheism, over, the, whole, inhabited, earth, by, obliterating, the, gods, his, worldview, was, not, atheist, in, a, strict, and, theoretical, sense, because, he, differentiated, them, from, the, primordial, deities, holding, that, they, were, eternal, and, imperishable, some, historians, have, argued, that, he, merely, aimed, at, reinventing, the, old, religions, in, the, light, of, the, beginning, of, deification, of, political, rulers, such, as, alexander, the, great, in, the, early, history, of, islam, muslim, scholars, recognized, the, idea, of, atheism, and, frequently, attacked, unbelievers, although, they, were, unable, to, name, any, atheists, when, individuals, were, accused, of, atheism, they, were, usually, viewed, as, heretics, rather, than, proponents, of, atheism, however, there, were, freethinkers, and, outspoken, critics, of, the, islamic, religion, such, as, deists, philosophers, rationalists, and, atheists, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, one, notable, figure, being, the, 9th, century, scholar, ibn, al, rawandi, who, criticized, the, notion, of, religious, prophecy, including, that, of, muhammad, and, maintained, that, religious, dogmas, were, not, acceptable, to, reason, and, must, be, rejected, other, critics, of, religion, in, the, islamic, world, include, the, poet, al, ma, arri, 973, 1057, the, scholar, abu, isa, al, warraq, fl, 9th, century, and, the, physician, and, philosopher, abu, bakr, al, razi, 865, 925, however, al, razi, s, atheism, may, have, been, deliberately, misdescribed, by, an, ismaili, missionary, named, abu, hatim, al, ma, arri, wrote, and, taught, that, religion, itself, was, a, fable, invented, by, the, ancients, and, that, humans, were, of, two, sorts, those, with, brains, but, no, religion, and, those, with, religion, but, no, brains, the, titular, character, of, the, icelandic, saga, hrafnkell, written, in, the, late, thirteenth, century, says, i, think, it, is, folly, to, have, faith, in, gods, after, his, temple, to, freyr, is, burnt, and, he, is, enslaved, he, vows, never, to, perform, another, sacrifice, a, position, described, in, the, sagas, as, go, lauss, godless, jacob, grimm, in, his, teutonic, mythology, observes, it, is, remarkable, that, old, norse, legend, occasionally, mentions, certain, men, who, turning, away, in, utter, disgust, and, doubt, from, the, heathen, faith, placed, their, reliance, on, their, own, strength, and, virtue, thus, in, the, s, lar, lio, 17, we, read, of, v, bogi, and, r, dey, sik, au, tr, u, in, themselves, they, trusted, citing, several, other, examples, including, two, kings, subsequent, to, grimm, s, investigation, scholars, including, j, r, r, tolkien, and, e, o, g, turville, petre, have, identified, the, go, lauss, ethic, as, a, stream, of, atheistic, and, or, humanistic, philosophy, in, the, icelandic, sagas, people, described, as, go, lauss, expressed, not, only, a, lack, of, faith, in, deities, but, also, a, pragmatic, belief, in, their, own, faculties, of, strength, reason, and, virtue, and, in, social, codes, of, honor, independent, of, any, supernatural, agency, another, phenomenon, in, the, middle, ages, was, proofs, of, the, existence, of, god, both, anselm, of, canterbury, and, later, william, of, ockham, acknowledge, adversaries, who, doubt, the, existence, of, god, thomas, aquinas, five, proofs, of, god, s, existence, and, anselm, s, ontological, argument, implicitly, acknowledged, the, validity, of, the, question, about, god, s, existence, frederick, copleston, however, explains, that, thomas, laid, out, his, proofs, not, to, counter, atheism, but, to, address, certain, early, christian, writers, such, as, john, of, damascus, who, asserted, that, knowledge, of, god, s, existence, was, naturally,

sixteenth, century, the, word, atheist, appears, in, english, books, at, least, as, early, as, 1566, the, concept, of, atheism, re, emerged, initially, as, a, reaction, to, the, intellectual, and, religious, turmoil, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, the, reformation, as, a, charge, used, by, those, who, saw, the, denial, of, god, and, godlessness, in, the, controversial, positions, being, put, forward, by, others, during, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, the, word, atheist, was, used, exclusively, as, an, insult, nobody, wanted, to, be, regarded, as, an, atheist, although,

of, moral, restraint, according, to, geoffrey, blainey, the, reformation, in, europe, had, paved, the, way, for, atheists, by, attacking, the, authority, of, the, catholic, church, which, in, turn,

1679, was, also, accused, of, atheism, but, he, denied, it, his, theism, was, unusual, in, that, he, held, god, to, be, material, even, earlier, the, british, playwright, and, poet, christopher, marlowe, 1563, 1593, was, accused, of, atheism, when, a, tract, denying, the, divinity, of, christ, was, found, in, his, home, before, he, could, finish, defending, himself, against, the, charge,

probably, the, first, well, known, semi, atheist, to, announce, himself, in, a, christian, land, in, the, modern, era, although, nowhere, in, his, work, does, spinoza, argue, against, the, existence, of, god, it, is, a, widespread, belief, that, spinoza, equated, god, with, the, material, universe, and, so, his, beliefs, have, been, categorized, as, pantheist, spinoza, had, been, expelled, from, his, synagogue, for, his, protests, against, the, teachings, of, its, rabbis, and, for, failing, to, attend, saturday, services, he, believed, that, god, did, not, interfere, in, the, running, of, the, world, but, rather, that, natural, laws, explained, the, workings, of, the, universe, in, 1661, he, published, his, short, treatise, on, god, but, he, was, not, a, popular, figure, for, the, first, century, following, his, death, an, unbeliever, was, expected, to, be, a, rebel, in, almost, everything, and, wicked, in, all, his, ways, wrote, blainey, but, here, was, a, virtuous, one, he, lived, the, good, life, and, made, his, living, in, a, useful, way, it, took, courage, to, be, a, spinoza, or, even, one, of, his, supporters, if, a, handful, of, scholars, agreed, with, his, writings, they, did, not, so, say, in, public, in, early, modern, times, the, first, explicit, atheist, known, by, name, was, the, german, languaged, danish, critic, of, religion, matthias, knutzen,

their, own, oppression, whereas, the, same, oppression, is, shielded, by, the, folk, in, a, way, that, if, the, wise, attempted, to, free, them, by, the, truth, they, would, be, quelled, by, the, very, people, while, not, gaining, converts, from, large, portions, of, the, population, versions, of, deism, became, influential, in, certain, intellectual, circles, jean, jacques, rousseau,

the, influential, figure, of, voltaire, spread, deistic, notions, to, a, wide, audience, after, the, french, revolution, and, its, outbursts, of, atheism, voltaire, was, widely, condemned, as, one, of, the, causes, wrote, blainey, nonetheless, his, writings, did, concede, that, fear, of, god, was, an, essential, policeman, in, a, disorderly, world, if, god, did, not, exist, it, would, be,

beginning, of, the, history, of, true, atheism, by, the, 1770s, atheism, in, some, predominantly, christian, countries, was, ceasing, to, be, a, dangerous, accusation, that, required, denial, and, was, evolving, into, a, position, openly, avowed, by, some, the, first, open, denial, of, the, existence, of, god, and, avowal, of, atheism, since, classical, times, may, be, that, of, baron, d, holbach, 1723, 1789, in, his, 1770, work, the, system, of, nature, d, holbach, was, a, parisian, social, figure, who, conducted, a, famous, salon, widely, attended, by, many, intellectual, notables, of, the, day, including, denis, diderot, jean, jacques, rousseau, david, hume, adam, smith, and, benjamin, franklin, nevertheless, his, book, was, published, under, a, pseudonym, and, was, banned,
