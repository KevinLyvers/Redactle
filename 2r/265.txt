both, countries, the, terms, were, nominalized, to, mean, those, who, serve, in, close, attendance, to, the, nobility, the, japanese, term, saburai, being, the, nominal, form, of, the, verb, according, to, wilson, an, early, reference, to, the, word, saburai, appears, in, the, kokin, wakash, the, first, imperial, anthology, of, poems, completed, in, the, early, 900s, originally, the, word, samurai, referred, to, anyone, who, served, the, emperor, the, imperial, family, or, the, imperial, court, nobility, even, in, a, non, military, capacity, it, was, not, until, the, 17th, century, that, the, term, gradually, became, a, title, for, military, servants, of, warrior, families, so, that, according, to, michael, wert, a, warrior, of, elite, stature, in, pre, seventeenth, century, japan, would, have, been, insulted, to, be, called, a, samurai, in, modern, usage, bushi, is, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, samurai, the, definition, of, samurai, varies, from, period,

gokenin, which, refers, to, bushi, who, owned, territory, and, served, the, shogun, however, there, were, some, samurai, of, exceptional, status, hi, gokenin, who, did, not, serve, the, shogun, subordinate, bushi, in, the, service, of, the, samurai, were, called, r, t, r, d, or, r, j, some, of, the, r, t, were, given, a, territory, and, a, family, name, and, as, samuraihon, or, saburaibon, they, acquired, a, status, equivalent, to, that, of, a, samurai, in, other, words, a, high, ranking, person, among, the, bushi, was, called, a, samurai, during, the, muromachi, period, as, in, the, kamakura, period, the, definition, of, samurai, referred, to, high, ranking, bushi, in, the, service, of, the, shogun, bushi, serving, shugo, daimyo, feudal, lords, were, not, considered, samurai, of, course, those, who, did, not, serve, a, particular, lord, such, as, the, r, nin, who, were, vagabonds, the, nobushi, who, were, armed, peasants, and, the, ashigaru, who, were, temporarily, hired, foot, soldiers, were, not, considered, samurai, during, the, sengoku, period, the, traditional, master, servant, relationship, in, japanese, society, collapsed, and, the, traditional, definition, of, samurai, changed, dramatically, becoming, synonymous, with, bushi, jizamurai, came, from, the, powerful, my, shu, who, owned, farmland, and, held, leadership, positions, in, their, villages, and,

could, take, family, names, while, some, ashigaru, could, and, only, samurai, wakat, were, considered, samurai, class, wakat, like, samurai, had, different, definitions, in, different, periods, meaning, a, young, bushi, in, the, muromachi, period, and, a, rank, below, kachi, and, above, ashigaru, in, the, edo, period, in, the, early, edo, period, even, some, daimy, feudal, lords, with, territories, of, 10, 000, koku, or, more, called, themselves, samurai, at, the, beginning, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, there, was, no, clear, distinction, between, hatamoto, and, gokenin, which, referred, to, direct, vassals, of, the, shogun, but, from, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, a, distinction, was, made, between, hatamoto, direct, vassals, with, territories, of, 10, 000, koku, or, less, who, were, entitled, to, an, audience, with, the, shogun, and, gokenin, those, without, such, rights, samurai, referred, to, hatamoto, in, the, tokugawa, shogunate, and, to, ch, kosh, or, higher, status, bushi, in, each, han, domains, during, this, period, most, bushi, came, to, serve, the, shogun, and, the, daimyo, of, each, domains, and, as, the, distinction, between, bushi, and, ch, nin, or, peasants, became, stricter, the, boundaries, between, the, definitions, of, samurai, and, bushi, became, blurred, since, then, the, term, samurai, has, been, used, to, refer, to, bushi, officially, however, the, high, ranking, bushi, were, called, samurai, and, the, low, ranking, bushi, were, called, kachi, samurai, and, kachi, were, represented, by, the, word, shibun, a, status, that, can, be, translated, as, warrior, class, bushi, class, or, samurai, class, samurai, were, entitled, to, an, audience, with, their, lord, were, allowed, to, ride, horses, and, received, rice,

of, the, shogunate, and, each, domain, gokenin, the, status, of, kachi, were, financially, impoverished, and, supported, themselves, by, making, bamboo, handicrafts, and, umbrellas, and, selling, plants, the, shibun, status, of, samurai, and, kachi, was, clearly, distinguished, from, the, keihai, status, of, the, ashigaru, and, ch, gen, who, served, them, but, it, was, more, difficult, to, rise, from, kachi, to, samurai, than, from, ashigaru, to, kachi, and, the, status, gap, between, samurai, who, were, high, ranking, bushi, and, kachi, who, were, low, ranking, bushi, was, quite, wide, during, the, edo, period, samurai, represented, a, hereditary, social, class, defined, by, the, right, to, bear, arms, and, to, hold, public, office, as, well, as, high, social, status, from, the, mid, edo, period, ch, nin, and, farmers, could, be, promoted, to, the, samurai, class, by, being, adopted, into, gokenin, families, or, by, serving, in, daikan, offices, and, kachi, could, be, transferred, to, lower, social, classes, such, as, ch, nin, by, changing, jobs, following, the, death, of, prince, sh, toku, and, the, victory, against, the, soga, clan, japan, underwent, widespread, reform, one, of, the, most, important, was, that, of, the, taika, reform, issued, by, emperor, k, toku, in, 645, this, edict, allowed, the, japanese, aristocracy, to, adopt, the, tang, dynasty, political, structure, bureaucracy, culture, religion, and, philosophy, as, part, of, the, taih, code, of, 702, and, the, later, y, r, code, the, population, was, required, to, report, regularly, for,

most, of, the, imperial, bureaucrats, into, 12, ranks, each, divided, into, two, sub, ranks, 1st, rank, being, the, highest, adviser, to, the, emperor, those, of, 6th, rank, and, below, were, referred, to, as, samurai, and, dealt, with, day, to, day, affairs, and, were, initially, civilian, public, servants, in, keeping, with, the, original, derivation, of, this, word, from, saburau, a, verb, meaning, to, serve, military, men, however, would, not, be, referred, to, as, samurai, for, many, more, centuries, in, the, early, heian, period, during, the, late, 8th, and, early, 9th,

the, ashikaga, shogunate, gradually, expanded, the, authority, of, the, shugo, the, local, military, and, police, officials, established, by, the, kamakura, shogunate, giving, the, shugo, jurisdiction, over, land, disputes, between, gokenin, and, allowing, the, shugo, to, receive, half, of, all, taxes, from, the, areas, they, controlled, the, shugo, shared, their, newfound, wealth, with, the, local, samurai, creating, a, hierarchical, relationship, between, the, shugo, and, the, samurai, and, the, first, early, daimyo, feudal, lords, called, shugo, daimyo, appeared, the, innovations, of, s, sh, swordsmiths, in, the, late, kamakura, period, allowed, them, to, produce, japanese, swords, with, tougher, blades, than, before, and, during, the, nanboku, ch, period, dachi, large, great, sword, were, at, their, peak, as, weapons, for, the, samurai, until, the, mongol, invasion, in, the, late, kamakura, period, the, main, battle, was, fought, by, small, groups, of, warriors, using, yumi, bows, from, horseback, and, close, combat, was, a, secondary, battle, from, the, nanboku, ch, period, to, the, muromachi, period, large, groups, of, infantrymen, became, more, active, in, battle, close, combat, became, more, important, and, the, naginata, and, tachi, which, had, been, used, since, the, heian, period, were, used, more, the, yari, spear, was, not, yet, a, major, weapon, in, this, period, during, the, nanboku, ch, period, many, lower, class, foot, soldiers, called, ashigaru, began, to, participate, in, battles, and, the, popularity, of, haramaki, increased, during, the, nanboku, ch, and, muromachi, periods, d, maru, and, haramaki, became, the, norm, and, senior, samurai, also, began, to, wear, haramaki, by, adding, kabuto, helmet, men, yoroi, face, armor, and, gauntlet, issues, of, inheritance, caused, family, strife, as, primogeniture, became, common, in, contrast, to, the, division, of, succession, designated, by, law, before, the, 14th, century, invasions, of, neighboring, samurai, territories, became, common, to, avoid, infighting, and, bickering, among, samurai, was, a, constant, problem, for, the, kamakura, and, ashikaga, shogunates, the, outbreak, of, the, onin, war, which, began, in, 1467, and, lasted, about, 10, years, devastated, kyoto, and, brought, down, the, power, of, the, ashikaga, shogunate, this, plunged, the, country, into, the, sengoku, period, warring, states, period, in, which, daimyo, feudal, lords, from, different, regions, fought, each, other, this, period, corresponds, to, the, late, muromachi, period, there, are, about, nine, theories, about, the, end, of, the, sengoku, period, the, earliest, being, the, year, 1568, when, oda, nobunaga, marched, on, kyoto, and, the, latest, being, the, suppression, of, the, shimabara, rebellion, in, 1638, thus, the, sengoku, period, overlaps, with, the, muromachi, azuchi, momoyama, and, edo, periods, depending, on, the, theory, in, any, case, the, sengoku, period, was, a, time, of, large, scale, civil, wars, throughout, japan, daimyo, who, became, more, powerful, as, the, shogunate, s, control, weakened, were, called, sengoku, daimyo, and, they, often, came, from, shugo, daimyo, shugodai, deputy, shugo, and, kokujin, or, kunibito, local, masters, in, other, words, sengoku, daimyo, differed, from, shugo, daimyo, in, that, sengoku, daimyo, was, able, to, rule, the, region, on, his, own, without, being, appointed, by, the, shogun, during, this, period, the, traditional, master, servant, relationship, between, the, lord, and, his, vassals, broke, down, with, the, vassals, eliminating, the, lord, internal, clan, and, vassal, conflicts, over, leadership, of, the, lord, s, family, and, frequent, rebellion, and, puppetry, by, branch, families, against, the, lord, s, family, these, events, sometimes, led, to, the, rise, of, samurai, to, the, rank, of, sengoku, daimyo, for, example, h, j, s, un, was, the, first, samurai, to, rise, to, the, rank, of, sengoku, daimyo, during, this, period, uesugi, kenshin, was, examples, of, shugodai, who, became, sengoku, daimyo, by, weakening, and, eliminating, the, power, of, their, lords, this, period, was, marked, by, the, loosening, of, samurai, culture, with, people, born, into, other, social, strata, sometimes, making, a, name, for, themselves, as, warriors, and, thus, becoming, de, facto, samurai, one, such, example, is, toyotomi, hideyoshi, a, well, known, figure, who, rose, from, a, peasant, background, to, become, a, samurai, sengoku, daimyo, and, kampaku, imperial, regent, from, this, time, on, infantrymen, called, ashigaru, who, were, mobilized, from, the, peasantry, were, mobilized, in, even, greater, numbers, than, before, and, the, importance, of, the, infantry, which, had, begun, in, the, nanboku, ch, period, increased, even, more, when, matchlocks, were, introduced, from, portugal, in, 1543, japanese, swordsmiths, immediately, began, to, improve, and, mass, produce, them, the, japanese, matchlock, was, named, tanegashima, after, the, tanegashima, island, which, is, believed, to, be, the, place, where, it, was, first, introduced, to, japan, by, the, end, of, the, sengoku, period, there, were, hundreds, of, thousands, of, arquebuses, in, japan, and, a, large, army, of, nearly, 100, 000, men, clashing, with, each, other, on, the, battlefield, ashigaru, began, to, fight, in, close, formation, using, yari, spear, and, tanegashima, as, a, result, yari, yumi, bow, and, tanegashima, became, the, primary, weapons, on, the, battlefield, the, naginata, which, was, difficult, to, maneuver, in, close, formation, and, the, long, heavy, tachi, fell, into, disuse, and, were, replaced, by, the, nagamaki, which, could, be, held, short, and, the, short, light, katana, which, appeared, in, the, nanboku, cho, period, and, gradually, became, more, common, the, tachi, was, often, cut, off, from, the, hilt, and, shortened, to, make, a, katana, the, tachi, which, had, become, inconvenient, for, use, on, the, battlefield, was, transformed, into, a, symbol, of, authority, carried, by, high, ranking, samurai, although, the, dachi, had, become, even, more, obsolete, some, sengoku, daimyo, dared, to, organize, assault, and, kinsmen, units, composed, entirely, of, large, men, equipped, with, dachi, to, demonstrate, the, bravery, of, their, armies, these, changes, in, the, aspect, of, the, battlefield, during, the, sengoku, period, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, tosei, gusoku, style, of, armor, which, improved, the, productivity, and, durability, of, armor, in, the, history, of, japanese, armor, this, was, the, most, significant, change, since, the, introduction, of, the, yoroi, and, d, mal, in, the, heian, period, in, this, style, the, number, of, parts, was, reduced, and, instead, armor, with, eccentric, designs, became, popular, by, the, end, of, the, sengoku, period, allegiances, between, warrior, vassals, also, known, as, military, retainers, and, lords, were, solidified, vassals, would, serve, lords, in, exchange, for, material, and, intangible, advantages, in, keeping, with, confucian, ideas, imported, from, china, between, the, seventh, and, ninth, centuries, these, independent, vassals, who, held, land, were, subordinate, to, their, superiors, who, may, be, local, lords, or, in, the, edo, period, the, shogun, a, vassal, or, samurai, could, expect, monetary, benefits, including, land, or, money, from, lords, in, exchange, for, their, military, services, the, azuchi, momoyama, period, refers, to, the, period, when, oda, nobunaga, and, toyotomi, hideyoshi, were, in, power, the, name, azuchi, momoyama, comes, from, the, fact, that, nobunaga, s, castle, azuchi, castle, was, located, in, azuchi, shiga, and, fushimi, castle, where, hideyoshi, lived, after, his, retirement, was, located, in, momoyama, there, are, several, theories, as, to, when, the, azuchi, momoyama, period, began, 1568, when, oda, nobunaga, entered, kyoto, in, support, of, ashikaga, yoshiaki, 1573, when, oda, nobunaga, expelled, ashikaga, yoshiaki, from, kyoto, and, 1576, when, the, construction, of, azuchi, castle, began, in, any, case, the, beginning, of, the, azuchii, momoyama, period, marked, the, complete, end, of, the, rule, of, the, ashikaga, shogunate, which, had, been, disrupted, by, the, onin, war, in, other, words, it, marked, the, end, of, the, muromachi, period, oda, nobunaga, was, the, well, known, lord, of, the, nagoya, area, once, called, owari, province, and, an, exceptional, example, of, a, samurai, of, the, sengoku, period, he, came, within, a, few, years, of, and, laid, down, the, path, for, his, successors, to, follow, the, reunification, of, japan, under, a, new, bakufu, shogunate, oda, nobunaga, made, innovations, in, the, fields, of, organization, and, war, tactics, made, heavy, use, of, arquebuses, developed, commerce, and, industry, and, treasured, innovation, consecutive, victories, enabled, him, to, realize, the, termination, of, the, ashikaga, bakufu, and, the, disarmament, of, the, military, powers, of, the, buddhist, monks, which, had, inflamed, futile, struggles, among, the, populace, for, centuries, attacking, from, the, sanctuary, of, buddhist, temples, they, were, constant, headaches, to, any, warlord, and, even, the, emperor, who, tried, to, control, their, actions, he, died, in, 1582, when, one, of, his, generals, akechi, mitsuhide, turned, upon, him, with, his, army, toyotomi, hideyoshi, and, tokugawa, ieyasu, who, founded, the, tokugawa, shogunate, were, loyal, followers, of, nobunaga, hideyoshi, began, as, a, peasant, and, became, one, of, nobunaga, s, top, generals, and, ieyasu, had, shared, his, childhood, with, nobunaga, hideyoshi, defeated, mitsuhide, within, a, month, and, was, regarded, as, the, rightful, successor, of, nobunaga, by, avenging, the, treachery, of, mitsuhide, these, two, were, able, to, use, nobunaga, s, previous, achievements, on, which, build, a, unified, japan, and, there, was, a, saying, the, reunification, is, a, rice, cake, oda, made, it, hashiba, shaped, it, in, the, end, only, ieyasu, tastes, it, hashiba, is, the, family, name, that, toyotomi, hideyoshi, used, while, he, was, a, follower, of, nobunaga, toyotomi, hideyoshi, who, became, a, grand, minister, in, 1586, created, a, law, that, non, samurai, were, not, allowed, to, carry, weapons, which, the, samurai, caste, codified, as, permanent, and, hereditary, thereby, ending, the, social, mobility, of, japan, which, lasted, until, the, dissolution, of, the, edo, shogunate, by, the, meiji, revolutionaries, the, distinction, between, samurai, and, non, samurai, was, so, obscure, that, during, the, 16th, century, most, male, adults, in, any, social, class, even, small, farmers, belonged, to, at, least, one, military, organization, of, their, own, and, served, in, wars, before, and, during, hideyoshi, s, rule, it, can, be, said, that, an, all, against, all, situation, continued, for, a, century, the, authorized, samurai, families, after, the, 17th, century, were, those, that, chose, to, follow, nobunaga, hideyoshi, and, ieyasu, large, battles, occurred, during, the, change, between, regimes, and, a, number, of, defeated, samurai, were, destroyed, went, r, nin, or, were, absorbed, into, the, general, populace, in, 1592, and, again, in, 1597, toyotomi, hideyoshi, aiming, to, invade, china, through, korea, mobilized, an, army, of, 160, 000, peasants, and, samurai, and, deployed, them, to, korea, in, one, of, the, largest, military, endeavors, in, eastern, asia, until, the, late, 19th, century, taking, advantage, of, arquebus, mastery, and, extensive, wartime, experience, from, the, sengoku, period, japanese, samurai, armies, made, major, gains, in, most, of, korea, a, few, of, the, famous, samurai, generals, of, this, war, were, kat, kiyomasa, konishi, yukinaga, and, shimazu, yoshihiro, kat, kiyomasa, advanced, to, orangkai, territory, present, day, manchuria, bordering, korea, to, the, northeast, and, crossed, the, border, into, northern, china, kiyomasa, withdrew, back, to, korea, after, retaliatory, counterattacks, from, the, jurchens, in, the, area, whose, castles, his, forces, had, raided, shimazu, yoshihiro, led, some, 7, 000, samurai, into, battle, and, despite, being, heavily, outnumbered, defeated, a, host, of, allied, ming, and, korean, forces, at, the, battle, of, sacheon, in, 1598, yoshihiro, was, feared, as, oni, shimazu, shimazu, ogre, and, his, nickname, spread, across, korea, and, into, china, in, spite, of, the, superiority, of, japanese, land, forces, the, two, expeditions, ultimately, failed, after, hideyoshi, s, death, though, the, invasions, did, devastate, the, korean, peninsula, the, causes, of, the, failure, included, korean, naval, superiority, which, led, by, admiral, yi, sun, sin, harassed, japanese, supply, lines, continuously, throughout, the, wars, resulting, in, supply, shortages, on, land, the, commitment, of, sizable, ming, forces, to, korea, korean, guerrilla, actions, wavering, japanese, commitment, to, the, campaigns, as, the, wars, dragged, on, and, the, underestimation, of, resistance, by, japanese, commanders, in, the, first, campaign, of, 1592, korean, defenses, on, land, were, caught, unprepared, under, trained, and, under, armed, they, were, rapidly, overrun, with, only, a, limited, number, of, successfully, resistant, engagements, against, the, more, experienced, and, battle, hardened, japanese, forces, during, the, second, campaign, in, 1597, korean, and, ming, forces, proved, far, more, resilient, and, with, the, support, of, continued, korean, naval, superiority, managed, to, limit, japanese, gains, to, parts, of, southeastern, korea, the, final, death, blow, to, the, japanese, campaigns, in, korea, came, with, hideyoshi, s, death, in, late, 1598, and, the, recall, of, all, japanese, forces, in, korea, by, the, council, of, five, elders, established, by, hideyoshi, to, oversee, the, transition, from, his, regency, to, that, of, his, son, hideyori, before, his, death, hideyoshi, ordered, that, japan, be, ruled, by, a, council, of, the, five, most, powerful, sengoku, daimyo, go, tair, council, of, five, elders, and, hideyoshi, s, five, retainers, go, bugy, five, commissioners, until, his, only, heir, the, five, year, old, toyotomi, hideyori, reached, the, age, of, 16, however, having, only, the, young, hideyori, as, hideyoshi, s, successor, weakened, the, toyotomi, regime, today, the, loss, of, all, of, hideyoshi, s, adult, heirs, is, considered, the, main, reason, for, the, downfall, of, the, toyotomi, clan, hideyoshi, s, younger, brother, toyotomi, hidenaga, who, had, supported, hideyoshi, s, rise, to, power, as, a, leader, and, strategist, had, already, died, of, illness, in, 1591, and, his, nephew, toyotomi, hidetsugu, who, was, hideyoshi, s, only, adult, successor, was, forced, to, commit, seppuku, in, 1595, along, with, many, other, vassals, on, hideyoshi, s, orders, for, suspected, rebellion, in, this, politically, unstable, situation, maeda, toshiie, one, of, the, gotair, died, of, illness, and, tokugawa, ieyasu, one, of, the, gotair, who, had, been, second, in, power, to, hideyoshi, but, had, not, participated, in, the, war, rose, to, power, and, ieyasu, came, into, conflict, with, ishida, mitsunari, one, of, the, go, buky, and, others, this, conflict, eventually, led, to, the, battle, of, sekigahara, in, which, the, t, gun, eastern, army, led, by, ieyasu, defeated, the, sei, gun, western, army, led, by, mitsunari, and, ieyasu, nearly, gained, control, of, japan, social, mobility, was, high, as, the, ancient, regime, collapsed, and, emerging, samurai, needed, to, maintain, a, large, military, and, administrative, organizations, in, their, areas, of, influence, most, of, the, samurai, families, that, survived, to, the, 19th, century, originated, in, this, era, declaring, themselves, to, be, the, blood, of, one, of, the, four, ancient, noble, clans, minamoto, taira, fujiwara, and, tachibana, in, most, cases, however, it, is, difficult, to, prove, these, claims, after, the, battle, of, sekigahara, when, the, tokugawa, shogunate, defeated, the, toyotomi, clan, at, summer, campaign, of, the, siege, of, osaka, in, 1615, the, long, war, period, ended, during, the, tokugawa, shogunate, samurai, increasingly, became, courtiers, bureaucrats, and, administrators, rather, than, warriors, with, no, warfare, since, the, early, 17th, century, samurai, gradually, lost, their, military, function, during, the, tokugawa, era, also, called, the, edo, period, following, the, passing, of, a, law, in, 1629, samurai, on, official, duty, were, required, to, practice, wear, two, swords, however, by, the, end, of, the, tokugawa, era, samurai, were, aristocratic, bureaucrats, for, the, with, their, daish, becoming, more, of, a, symbolic, emblem, of, power, rather, than, a, weapon, used, in, daily, life, they, still, had, the, legal, right, to, cut, down, any, commoner, who, did, not, show, proper, respect, kiri, sute, gomen, but, to, what, extent, this, right, was, used, is, unknown, when, the, central, government, forced, daimy, s, to, cut, the, size, of, their, armies, unemployed, r, nin, became, a, social, problem, theoretical, obligations, between, a, samurai, and, his, lord, usually, a, daimy, increased, from, the, genpei, era, to, the, edo, era, they, were, strongly, emphasized, by, the, teachings, of, confucius, and, mencius, which, were, required, reading, for, the, educated, samurai, class, the, leading, figures, who, introduced, confucianism, in, japan, in, the, early, tokugawa, period, were, fujiwara, seika, 1561, 1619, hayashi, razan, 1583, 1657, and, matsunaga, sekigo, 1592, 1657, pederasty, permeated, the, culture, of, samurai, in, the, early, seventeenth, century, the, relentless, condemnation, of, pederasty, by, jesuit, missionaries, also, hindered, attempts, to, convert, japan, s, governing, elite, to, christianity, pederasty, had, become, deeply, institutionalized, among, the, daimyo, and, samurai, prompting, comparisons, to, ancient, athens, and, sparta, the, jesuits, strong, condemnation, of, the, practice, alienated, many, of, japan, s, ruling, class, creating, further, barriers, to, their, acceptance, of, christianity, tokugawa, iemitsu, the, third, shogun, was, known, for, his, interest, in, pederasty, the, conduct, of, samurai, served, as, role, model, behavior, for, the, other, social, classes, with, time, on, their, hands, samurai, spent, more, time, in, pursuit, of, other, interests, such, as, becoming, scholars, after, the, edo, period, it, came, to, cover, all, of, society, and, although, the, shogunate, sometimes, invited, monks, as, advisors, the, nobility, was, excluded, from, the, government, as, a, result, samurai, began, to, assume, all, civilian, roles, and, from, the, edo, period, onward, samurai, shifted, their, activities, from, military, to, political, administration, in, addition, those, who, were, newly, promoted, to, the, shogunate, or, domain, in, recognition, of, talents, unrelated, to, martial, arts, such, as, literature, and, scholarship, were, also, given, the, status, of, samurai, it, can, be, said, that, the, difference, between, a, samurai, and, a, military, officer, appears, in, such, a, place, in, the, edo, period, samurai, equivalent, to, civil, servants, and, administrative, officers, were, called, officials, samurai, were, given, an, honorific, title, and, were, called, obuke, sama, from, the, mid, edo, period, wealthy, ch, nin, townsman, and, farmers, could, join, the, samurai, class, by, giving, a, large, sum, of, money, to, an, impoverished, gokenin, to, be, adopted, into, a, samurai, family, and, inherit, the, samurai, s, position, and, stipend, the, amount, of, money, given, to, a, gokenin, varied, according, to, his, position, 1, 000, ryo, for, a, yoriki, and, 500, ryo, for, an, kachi, some, of, their, descendants, were, promoted, to, hatamoto, and, held, important, positions, in, the, shogunate, some, of, the, peasants, children, were, promoted, to, the, samurai, class, by, serving, in, the, daikan, office, kachi, could, change, jobs, and, move, into, the, lower, classes, such, as, ch, nin, for, example, takizawa, bakin, became, a, ch, nin, by, working, for, tsutaya, j, zabur, in, the, late, 1500s, trade, between, japan, and, southeast, asia, accelerated, and, increased, exponentially, when, the, tokugawa, shogunate, was, established, in, the, early, 1600s, the, destinations, of, the, trading, ships, the, red, seal, ships, were, thailand, the, philippines, vietnam, cambodia, etc, many, japanese, moved, to, southeast, asia, and, established, japanese, towns, there, many,

was, originally, a, palanquin, bearer, who, belonged, to, the, lowest, end, of, the, samurai, class, but, he, rose, to, prominence, in, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, now, in, southern, thailand, and, became, governor, of, the, nakhon, si, thammarat, kingdom, when, the, policy, of, national, isolation, sakoku, was, established, in, 1639, trade, between, japan, and, southeast, asia, ceased, and,

allowed, to, participate, in, western, trade, and, even, then, it, was, based, largely, on, the, idea, of, playing, the, franciscans, and, dominicans, against, one, another, in, exchange, for, the,

for, his, quote, if, a, man, does, not, investigate, into, the, matter, of, bushido, daily, it, will, be, difficult, for, him, to, die, a, brave, and, manly, death, thus, it, is, essential, to,

and, grandson, and, became, the, basis, for, tsunetomo, yamamoto, s, hagakure, he, is, best, known, for, his, saying, the, way, of, the, samurai, is, in, desperateness, ten, men, or, more, cannot, kill, such, a, man, torii, mototada, 1539, 1600, was, a, feudal, lord, in, the, service, of, tokugawa, ieyasu, on, the, eve, of, the, battle, of, sekigahara, he, volunteered, to, remain, behind, in, the, doomed, fushimi, castle, while, his, lord, advanced, to, the, east, torii, and, tokugawa, both, agreed, that, the, castle, was, indefensible, in, an, act, of, loyalty, to, his, lord, torii, chose, to, remain, behind, pledging, that, he, and, his, men, would, fight, to, the, finish, as, was, custom, torii, vowed, that, he, would, not, be, taken, alive, in, a, dramatic, last, stand, the,

that, to, sacrifice, one, s, life, for, the, sake, of, his, master, is, an, unchanging, principle, that, i, should, be, able, to, go, ahead, of, all, the, other, warriors, of, this, country, and, lay, down, my, life, for, the, sake, of, my, master, s, benevolence, is, an, honor, to, my, family, and, has, been, my, most, fervent, desire, for, many, years, it, is, said, that, both, men, cried, when, they, parted, ways, because, they, knew, they, would, never, see, each, other, again, torii, s, father, and, grandfather, had, served, the, tokugawa, before, him, and, his, own, brother, had, already, been, killed, in, battle, torii, s, actions, changed, the, course, of, japanese, history, ieyasu, tokugawa, successfully, raised, an, army, and, won, at, sekigahara, the, translator, of, hagakure, william, scott, wilson, observed, examples, of, warrior, emphasis, on, death, in, clans, other, than, yamamoto, s, he, takeda, shingen, was, a, strict, disciplinarian, as, a, warrior, and, there, is, an, exemplary, story, in, the, hagakure, relating, his, execution, of, two, brawlers, not, because, they, had, fought, but, because, they, had, not, fought, to, the, death, the, rival, of, takeda, shingen, 1521, 1573, was, uesugi, kenshin, 1530, 1578, a, legendary, sengoku, warlord, well, versed, in, the, chinese, military, classics, and, who, advocated, the, way, of, the, warrior, as, death, japanese, historian, daisetz, teitaro, suzuki, describes, uesugi, s, beliefs, as, those, who, are, reluctant, to, give, up, their, lives, and, embrace, death, are, not, true, warriors, go, to, the, battlefield, firmly, confident, of, victory, and, you, will, come, home, with, no, wounds, whatever, engage, in, combat, fully, determined, to, die, and, you, will, be, alive, wish, to, survive, in, the, battle, and, you, will, surely, meet, death, when, you, leave, the, house, determined, not, to, see, it, again, you, will, come, home, safely, when, you, have, any, thought, of, returning, you, will, not, return, you, may, not, be, in, the, wrong, to, think, that, the, world, is, always, subject, to, change, but, the, warrior, must, not, entertain, this, way, of, thinking, for, his, fate, is, always, determined, families, such, as, the, imagawa, were, influential, in, the, development, of, warrior, ethics, and, were, widely, quoted, by, other, lords, during, their, lifetime, the, writings, of, imagawa, sadayo, were, highly, respected, and, sought, out, by, tokugawa, ieyasu, as, the, source, of, japanese, feudal, law, the, philosophies, of, confucianism, buddhism, and, zen, and, to, a, lesser, extent, shinto, influenced, the, samurai, culture, zen, meditation, became, an, important, teaching, because, it, offered, a, process, to, calm, one, s, mind, the, buddhist, concept, of, reincarnation, and, rebirth, led, samurai, to, abandon, torture, and, needless, killing, while, some, samurai, even, gave, up, violence, altogether, and, became, buddhist, monks, after, coming, to, believe, that, their, killings, were, fruitless, some, were, killed, as, they, came, to, terms, with, these, conclusions, in, the, battlefield, the, most, defining, role, that, confucianism, played, in, samurai, philosophy, was, to, stress, the, importance, of, the, lord, retainer, relationship, the, loyalty, that, a, samurai, was, required, to, show, his, lord, literature, on, the, subject, of, bushido, such, as, hagakure, hidden, in, leaves, by, yamamoto, tsunetomo, and, gorin, no, sho, book, of, the, five, rings, by, miyamoto, musashi, both, written, in, the, edo, period, contributed, to, the, development, of, bushid, and, zen, philosophy, according, to, robert, sharf, the, notion, that, zen, is, somehow, related, to, japanese, culture, in, general, and, bushid, in, particular, is, familiar, to, western, students, of, zen, through, the, writings, of, d, t, suzuki, no, doubt, the, single, most, important, figure, in, the, spread, of, zen, in, the, west, in, december, 1547, francis, was, in, malacca, malaysia, waiting, to, return, to, goa, india, when, he, met, a, low, ranked, samurai, named, anjiro, possibly, spelled, yajiro, anjiro, was, not, an, intellectual, but, he, impressed, xavier, because, he, took, careful, notes, of, everything, he, said, in, church, xavier, made, the, decision, to, go, to, japan, in, part, because, this, low, ranking, samurai, convinced, him, in, portuguese, that, the, japanese, people, were, highly, educated, and, eager, to, learn, they, were, hard, workers, and, respectful, of, authority, in, their, laws, and, customs, they, were, led, by, reason, and, should, the, christian, faith, convince, them, of, its, truth, they, would, accept, it, en, masse, by, the, 12th, century, upper, class, samurai, were, highly, literate, because, of, the, general, introduction, of, confucianism, from, china, during, the, 7th, to, 9th, centuries, and, in, response, to, their, perceived, need, to, deal, with, the, imperial, court, who, had, a, monopoly, on, culture, and, literacy, for, most, of, the, heian, period, as, a, result, they, aspired, to, the, more, cultured, abilities, of, the, nobility, examples, such, as, taira, tadanori, a, samurai, who, appears, in, the, heike, monogatari, demonstrate, that, warriors, idealized, the, arts, and, aspired, to, become, skilled, in, them, tadanori, was, famous, for, his, skill, with, the, pen, and, the, sword, or, the, bun, and, the, bu, the, harmony, of, fighting, and, learning, samurai, were, expected, to, be, cultured, and, literate, and, admired, the, ancient, saying, bunbu, ry, d, literary, arts, military, arts, both, ways, or, the, pen, and, the, sword, in, accord, by, the, time, of, the, edo, period, japan, had, a, higher, literacy, comparable, to, that, in, central, europe, the, number, of, men, who, actually, achieved, the, ideal, and, lived, their, lives, by, it, was, high, an, early, term, for, warrior, uruwashii, was, written, with, a, kanji, that, combined, the, characters, for, literary, study, bun, and, military, arts, bu, and, is, mentioned, in, the, heike, monogatari, late, 12th, century, the, heike, monogatari, makes, reference, to, the, educated, poet, swordsman, ideal, in, its, mention, of, taira, no, tadanori, s, death, friends, and, foes, alike, wet, their, sleeves, with, tears, and, said, what, a, pity, tadanori, was, a, great, general, pre, eminent, in, the, arts, of, both, sword, and, poetry, in, his, book, ideals, of, the, samurai, translator, william, scott, wilson, states, the, warriors, in, the, heike, monogatari, served, as, models, for, the, educated, warriors, of, later, generations, and, the, ideals, depicted, by, them, were, not, assumed, to, be, beyond, reach, rather, these, ideals, were, vigorously, pursued, in, the, upper, echelons, of, warrior, society, and, recommended, as, the, proper, form, of, the, japanese, man, of, arms, with, the, heike, monogatari, the, image, of, the, japanese, warrior, in, literature, came, to, its, full, maturity, wilson, then, translates, the, writings, of, several, warriors, who, mention, the, heike, monogatari, as, an, example, for, their, men, to, follow, a, number, of, warrior, writings, document, this, ideal, from, the, 13th, century, onward, most, warriors, aspired, to, or, followed, this, ideal, to, varying, degrees, as, aristocrats, for, centuries, samurai, developed, their, own, cultures, that, influenced, japanese, culture, as, a, whole, waka, japanese, poetry, noh, japanese, dance, drama, kemari, japanese,

and, were, essential, cultural, pursuits, for, daimyo, and, samurai, the, view, of, life, and, death, expressed, in, noh, plays, was, something, the, samurai, of, the, time, could, relate, to, owning, tea, utensils, used, in, the, tea, ceremony, was, a, matter, of, prestige, for, daimyo, and, samurai, and, in, some, cases, tea, utensils, were, given, in, exchange, for, land, as, a, reward, for,

for, a, voyage, to, meaco, will, return, and, then, with, the, good, help, of, god, we, shall, sail, thither, the, distance, from, cagoxima, is, three, hundred, leagues, we, hear, wonderful, stories, about, the, size, of, meaco, they, say, that, it, consists, of, more, than, ninety, thousand, dwellings, there, is, a, very, famous, university, there, as, well, as, five, chief, colleges, of, students, and, more, than, two, hundred, monasteries, of, bonzes, and, of, others, who, are, like, coenobites, called, legioxi, as, well, as, of, women, of, the, same, kind, who, are, called, hamacutis, besides, this, of, meaco, there, are, in, japan, five, other, principal, academies, at, coya, at, negu, at, fisso, and, at, homia, these, are, situated, round, meaco, with, short, distances, between, them, and, each, is, frequented, by, about, three, thousand, five, hundred, scholars, besides, these, there, is, the, academy, at, bandou, much, the, largest, and, most, famous, in, all, japan, and, at, a, great, distance, from, meaco, bandou, is, a, large, territory, ruled, by, six, minor, princes, one, of, whom, is, more, powerful, than, the, others, and, is, obeyed, by, them, being, himself, subject, to, the, king, of, japan, who, is, called, the, great, king, of, meaco, the, things, that, are, given, out, as, to, the, greatness, and, celebrity, of, these, universities, and, cities, are, so, wonderful, as, to, make, us, think, of, seeing, them, first, with, our, own, eyes, and, ascertaining, the, truth, and, then, when, we, have, discovered, and, know, how, things, really, are, of, writing, an, account, of, them, to, you, they, say, that, there, are, several, lesser, academies, besides, those, which, we, have, mentioned, a, samurai, was, usually, named, by, combining, one, kanji, from, his, father, or, grandfather, and, one, new, kanji, samurai, normally, used, only, a, small, part, of, their, total, name, for, example, the, full, name, of, oda, nobunaga, was, oda, kazusanosuke, saburo, nobunaga, in, which, oda, is, a, clan, or, family, name, kazusanosuke, is, a, title, of, vice, governor, of, kazusa, province, saburo, is, a, formal, nickname, yobina, and, nobunaga, is, an, adult, name, nanori, given, at, genpuku, the, coming, of, age, ceremony, a, man, was, addressed, by, his, family, name, and, his, title, or, by, his, yobina, if, he, did, not, have, a, title, however, the, nanori, was, a, private, name, that, could, be, used, by, only, a, very, few, including, the, emperor, samurai, could, choose, their, own, nanori, and, frequently, changed, their, names, to, reflect, their, allegiances, samurai, were, given, the, privilege, of, carrying, two, swords, and, using, samurai, surnames, to, identify, themselves, from, the, common, people, samurai, had, arranged, marriages, which, were, arranged, by, a, go, between, of, the, same, or, higher, rank, while, for, those, samurai, in, the, upper, ranks, this, was, a, necessity, as, most, had, few, opportunities, to, meet, women, this, was, a, formality, for, lower, ranked, samurai, most, samurai, married, women, from, a, samurai, family, but, for, lower, ranked, samurai, marriages, with, commoners, were, permitted, in, these, marriages, a, dowry, was, brought, by, the, woman, and, was, used, to, set, up, the, couple, s, new, household, a, samurai, could, take, concubines, but, their, backgrounds, were, checked, by, higher, ranked, samurai, in, many, cases, taking, a, concubine, was, akin, to, a, marriage, kidnapping, a, concubine, although, common, in, fiction, would, have, been, shameful, if, not, criminal, if, the, concubine, was, a, commoner, a, messenger, was, sent, with, betrothal, money, or, a, note, for, exemption, of, tax, to, ask, for, her, parents, acceptance, even, though, the, woman, would, not, be, a, legal, wife, a, situation, normally, considered, a, demotion, many, wealthy, merchants, believed, that, being, the, concubine, of, a, samurai, was, superior, to, being, the, legal, wife, of, a, commoner, when, a, merchant, s, daughter, married, a, samurai, her, family, s, money, erased, the, samurai, s, debts, and, the, samurai, s, social, status, improved, the, standing, of, the, merchant, family, if, a, samurai, s, commoner, concubine, gave, birth, to, a, son, the, son, could, inherit, his, father, s, social, status, a, samurai, could, divorce, his, wife, for, a, variety, of, reasons, with, approval, from, a, superior, but, divorce, was, while, not, entirely, nonexistent, a, rare, event, a, wife, s, failure, to, produce, a, son, was, cause, for, divorce, but, adoption, of, a, male, heir, was, considered, an, acceptable, alternative, to, divorce, a, samurai, could, divorce, for, personal, reasons, even, if, he, simply, did, not, like, his, wife, but, this, was, generally, avoided, as, it, would, embarrass, the, person, who, had, arranged, the, marriage, a, woman, could, also, arrange, a, divorce, although, it, would, generally, take, the, form, of, the, samurai, divorcing, her, after, a, divorce, samurai, had, to, return, the, betrothal, money, which, often, prevented, divorces, maintaining, the, household, was, the, main, duty, of, women, of, the, samurai, class, this, was, especially, crucial, during, early, feudal, japan, when, warrior, husbands, were, often, traveling, abroad, or, engaged, in, clan, battles, the, wife, or, okugatasama, meaning, one, who, remains, in, the, home, was, left, to, manage, all, household, affairs, care, for, the, children, and, perhaps, even, defend, the, home, forcibly, for, this, reason, many, women, of, the, samurai, class, were, trained, in, wielding, a, polearm, called, a, naginata, or, a, special, knife, called, the, kaiken, in, an, art, called, tantojutsu, lit, the, skill, of, the, knife, which, they, could, use, to, protect, their, household, family, and, honor, if, the, need, arose, there, were, women, who, actively, engaged, in, battles, alongside, male, samurai, in, japan, although, most, of, these, female, warriors, were, not, formal, samurai, a, samurai, s, daughter, s, greatest, duty, was, political, marriage, these, women, married, members, of, enemy, clans, of, their, families, to, form, a, diplomatic, relationship, these, alliances, were, stages, for, many, intrigues, wars, and, tragedies, throughout, japanese, history, a, woman, could, divorce, her, husband, if, he, did, not, treat, her, well, and, also, if, he, was, a, traitor, to, his, wife, s, family, a, famous, case, was, that, of, oda, tokuhime, daughter, of, oda, nobunaga, irritated, by, the, antics, of, her, mother, in, law, lady, tsukiyama, the, wife, of, tokugawa, ieyasu, she, was, able, to, get, lady, tsukiyama, arrested, on, suspicion, of, communicating, with, the, takeda, clan, then, a, great, enemy, of, nobunaga, and, the, oda, clan, ieyasu, also, arrested, his, own, son, matsudaira, nobuyasu, who, was, tokuhime, s, husband, because, nobuyasu, was, close, to, his, mother, lady, tsukiyama, to, assuage, his, ally, nobunaga, ieyasu, had, lady, tsukiyama, executed, in, 1579, and, that, same, year, ordered, his, son, to, commit, seppuku, to, prevent, him, from, seeking, revenge, for, the, death, of, his, mother, traits, valued, in, women, of, the, samurai, class, were, humility, obedience, self, control, strength, and, loyalty, ideally, a, samurai, wife, would, be, skilled, at, managing, property, keeping, records, dealing, with, financial, matters, educating, the, children, and, perhaps, servants, as, well, and, caring, for, elderly, parents, or, in, laws, that, may, be, living, under, her, roof, confucian, law, which, helped, define, personal, relationships, and, the, code, of, ethics, of, the, warrior, class, required, that, a, woman, show, subservience, to, her, husband, filial, piety, to, her, parents, and, care, to, the, children, too, much, love, and, affection, was, also, said, to, indulge, and, spoil, the, youngsters, thus, a, woman, was, also, to, exercise, discipline, though, women, of, wealthier, samurai, families, enjoyed, perks, of, their, elevated, position, in, society, such, as, avoiding, the, physical, labor, that, those, of, lower, classes, often, engaged, in, they, were, still, viewed, as, far, beneath, men, women, were, prohibited, from, engaging, in, any, political, affairs, and, were, usually, not, the, heads, of, their, household, this, does, not, mean, that, women, in, the, samurai, class, were, always, powerless, powerful, women, both, wisely, and, unwisely, wielded, power, at, various, occasions, throughout, history, several, women, of, the, samurai, class, have, acquired, political, power, and, influence, even, though, they, have, not, received, these, privileges, de, jure, after, ashikaga, yoshimasa, 8th, sh, gun, of, the, muromachi, shogunate, lost, interest, in, politics, his, wife, hino, tomiko, largely, ruled, in, his, place, nene, wife, of, toyotomi, hideyoshi, was, known, to, overrule, her, husband, s, decisions, at, times, and, yodo, dono, his, concubine, became, the, de, facto, master, of, osaka, castle, and, the, toyotomi, clan, after, hideyoshi, s, death, tachibana, ginchiyo, was, chosen, to, lead, the, tachibana, clan, after, her, father, s, death, yamauchi, chiyo, wife, of, yamauchi, kazutoyo, has, long, been, considered, the, ideal, samurai, wife, according, to, legend, she, made, her, kimono, out, of, a, quilted, patchwork, of, bits, of, old, cloth, and, saved, pennies, to, buy, her, husband, a, magnificent, horse, on, which, he, rode, to, many, victories, the, fact, that, chiyo, though, she, is, better, known, as, wife, of, yamauchi, kazutoyo, is, held, in, such, high, esteem, for, her, economic, sense, is, illuminating, in, the, light, of, the, fact, that, she, never, produced, an, heir, and, the, yamauchi, clan, was, succeeded, by, kazutoyo, s, younger, brother, the, source, of, power, for, women, may, have, been, that, samurai, left, their, finances, to, their, wives, several, women, ascended, the, chrysanthemum, throne, as, a, female, imperial, ruler, josei, tenn, as, the, tokugawa, period, progressed, more, value, became, placed, on, education, and, the, education, of, females, beginning, at, a, young, age, became, important, to, families, and, society, as, a, whole, marriage, criteria, began, to, weigh, intelligence, and, education, as, desirable, attributes, in, a, wife, right, along, with, physical, attractiveness, though, many, of, the, texts, written, for, women, during, the, tokugawa, period, only, pertained, to, how, a, woman, could, become, a, successful, wife, and, household, manager, there, were, those, that, undertook, the, challenge, of, learning, to, read, and, also, tackled, philosophical, and, literary, classics, nearly, all, women, of, the, samurai, class, were, literate, by, the, end, of, the, tokugawa, period, during, the, existence, of, the, samurai, two, opposite, types, of, organization, reigned, the, first, type, were, recruits, based, armies, at, the, beginning, during, the, nara, period, samurai, armies, relied, on, armies, of, chinese, type, recruits, and, towards, the, end, in, infantry, units, composed, of, ashigaru, the, second, type, of, organization, was, that, of, a, samurai, on, horseback, who, fought, individually, or, in, small, groups, at, the, beginning, of, the, contest, a, series, of, bulbous, headed, arrows, were, shot, which, buzzed, in, the, air, the, purpose, of, these, shots, was, to, call, the, kami, to, witness, the, displays, of, courage, that, were, about, to, unfold, after, a, brief, exchange, of, arrows, between, the, two, sides, a, contest, called, ikkiuchi, was, developed, where, great, rivals, on, both, sides, faced, each, other, after, these, individual, combats, the, major, combats, were, given, way, usually, sending, infantry, troops, led, by, samurai, on, horseback, at, the, beginning, of, the, samurai, battles, it, was, an, honor, to, be, the, first, to, enter, battle, this, changed, in, the, sengoku, period, with, the, introduction, of, the, arquebus, at, the, beginning, of, the, use, of, firearms, the, combat, methodology, was, as, follows, at, the, beginning, an, exchange, of, arquebus, shots, was, made, at, a, distance, of, approximately, 100, meters, when, the, time, was, right, the, ashigaru, spearmen, were, ordered, to, advance, and, finally, the, samurai, would, attack, either, on, foot, or, on, horseback, the, army, chief, would, sit, in, a, scissor, chair, inside, a, semi, open, tent, called, maku, which, exhibited, its, respective, mon, and, represented, the, bakufu, government, from, the, maku, in, the, middle, of, the, contest, some, samurai, decided, to, get, off, the, horse, and, seek, to, cut, off, the, head, of, a, worthy, rival, this, act, was, considered, an, honor, through, it, they, gained, respect, among, the, military, class, after, the, battle, the, high, ranking, samurai, normally, celebrated, with, a, tea, ceremony, and, the, victorious, general, reviewed, the, heads, of, the, most, important, members, of, the, enemy, which, had, been, cut, most, of, the, battles, were, not, resolved, in, the, ideal, manner, mentioned, above, most, wars, were, won, through, surprise, attacks, such, as, night, raids, fires, etc, the, renowned, samurai, minamoto, no, tametomo, said, according, to, my, experience, there, is, nothing, more, advantageous, when, it, comes, to, crushing, the, enemy, than, a, night, attack, if, we, set, fire, to, three, of, the, sides, and, close, the, passage, through, the, room, those, who, flee, from, the, flames, will, be, shot, down, by, arrows, and, those, who, seek, to, escape, from, them, will, not, be, able, to, flee, from, the, flames, cutting, off, the, head, of, a, worthy, rival, on, the, battlefield, was, a, source, of, great, pride, and, recognition, there, was, a, detailed, ritual, to, beautify, the, severed, heads, first, they, were, washed, and, combed, and, once, this, was, done, the, teeth, were, blackened, by, applying, a, dye, called, ohaguro, the, reason, for, blackening, the, teeth, was, that, white, teeth, was, a, sign, of, distinction, so, applying, a, dye, to, darken, them, was, a, desecration, the, heads, were, carefully, arranged, on, a, table, for, exposure, in, 1600, kani, saiz, participated, in, the, battle, of, sekigahara, as, the, forerunner, of, fukushima, masanori, s, army, in, the, outpost, battle, of, gifu, castle, he, took, the, heads, of, 17, enemy, soldiers, and, was, greatly, praised, by, tokugawa, ieyasu, he, fought, with, a, bamboo, stalk, on, his, back, and, would, mark, the, heads, of, his, defeated, enemies, by, putting, bamboo, leaves, in, their, cut, necks, or, mouths, since, he, could, not, carry, every, head, thus, he, gained, the, nickname, bamboo, saizo, during, toyotomi, hideyoshi, s, invasions, of, korea, the, number, of, severed, heads, of, the, enemies, to, be, sent, to, japan, was, such, that, for, logistical, reasons, only, the, noses, were, sent, these, were, covered, with, salt, and, shipped, in, wooden, barrels, these, barrels, were, buried, in, a, burial, mound, near, the, great, buddha, of, hideyoshi, where, they, remain, today, under, the, wrong, name, of, mimizuka, or, ear, mound, during, the, azuchi, momoyama, period, and, thanks, to, the, introduction, of, firearms, combat, tactics, changed, dramatically, the, military, formations, adopted, had, poetic, names, among, which, are, most, samurai, were, bound, by, a, code, of, honor, and, were, expected, to, set, an, example, for, those, below, them, a, notable, part, of, their, code, is, seppuku, seppuku, or, hara, kiri, which, allowed, a, disgraced, samurai, to, regain, his, honor, by, passing, into, death, where, samurai, were, still, beholden, to, social, rules, while, there, are, many, romanticized, characterizations, of, samurai, behavior, such, as, the, writing, of, bushido, the, soul, of, japan, in, 1899, studies, of, kobud, and, traditional, bud, indicate, that, the, samurai, were, as, practical, on, the, battlefield, as, were, any, other, warriors, some, writers, take, issue, with, the, very, mention, of, the, term, bushido, when, not, used, to, describe, an, individual, samurai, s, usage, of, the, word, because, of, how, broad, and, changed, the, meaning, of, it, has, become, over, time, despite, the, rampant, romanticism, of, the, 20th, century, samurai, could, be, disloyal, and, treacherous, e, g, akechi, mitsuhide, cowardly, brave, or, overly, loyal, e, g, kusunoki, masashige, samurai, were, usually, loyal, to, their, immediate, superiors, who, in, turn, allied, themselves, with, higher, lords, these, loyalties, to, the, higher, lords, often, shifted, for, example, the, high, lords, allied, under, toyotomi, hideyoshi, were, served, by, loyal, samurai, but, the, feudal, lords, under, them, could, shift, their, support, to, tokugawa, taking, their, samurai, with, them, there, were, however, also, notable, instances, where, samurai, would, be, disloyal, to, their, lord, daimy, when, loyalty, to, the, emperor, was, seen, to, have, supremacy, samurai, figures, have, been, the, subject, for, legends, folk, tales, dramatic, stories, i, e, gunki, monogatari, theatre, productions, in, kabuki, and,
