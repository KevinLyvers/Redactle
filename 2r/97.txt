roman, victory, the, punic, wars, were, a, series, of, wars, between, 264, and, 146, bc, fought, between, the, roman, republic, and, ancient, carthage, three, wars, took, place, on, both, land, and, sea, across, the, western, mediterranean, region, and, involved, a, total, of, forty, three, years, of, warfare, the, punic, wars, are, also, considered, to, include, the, four, year, long, revolt, against, carthage, which, started, in, 241, bc, each, war, involved, immense, materiel, and, human, losses, on, both, sides, the, first, punic, war, broke, out, on, the, mediterranean, island, of, sicily, in, 264, bc, as, rome, s, expansion, began, to, encroach, on, carthage, s, sphere, of, influence, on, the, island, at, the, start, of, the, war, carthage, was, the, dominant, power, of, the, western, mediterranean, with, an, extensive, maritime, empire, while, rome, was, a, rapidly, expanding, power, in, italy, with, a, strong, army, but, no, navy, the, fighting, took, place, primarily, on, sicily, and, its, surrounding, waters, as, well, as, in, north, africa, corsica, and, sardinia, it, lasted, 23, years, until, 241, bc, when, the, carthaginians, were, defeated, by, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, lutatius, 241, amended, 237, bc, carthage, paid, large, reparations, and, sicily, was, annexed, as, a, roman, province, the, end, of, the, war, sparked, a, major, but, eventually, unsuccessful, revolt, within, carthaginian, territory, known, as, the, mercenary, war, the, second, punic, war, began, in, 218, bc, and, witnessed, the, carthaginian, general, hannibal, s, crossing, of, the, alps, and, invasion, of, mainland, italy, this, expedition, enjoyed, considerable, early, success, and, campaigned, in, italy, for, 14, years, before, the, survivors, withdrew, there, was, also, extensive, fighting, in, iberia, modern, spain, and, portugal, sicily, sardinia, and, north, africa, the, successful, roman, invasion, of, the, carthaginian, homeland, in, africa, in, 204, bc, led, to, hannibal, s, recall, he, was, defeated, in, the, battle, of, zama, in, 202, bc, and, carthage, sued, for, peace, a, treaty, was, agreed, in, 201, bc, which, stripped, carthage, of, its, overseas, territories, and, some, of, its, african, ones, imposed, a, large, indemnity, severely, restricted, the, size, of, its, armed, forces, and, prohibited, carthage, from, waging, war, without, rome, s, express, permission, this, caused, carthage, to, cease, to, be, a, military, threat, in, 151, bc, carthage, attempted, to, defend, itself, against, numidian, encroachments, and, rome, used, this, as, a, justification, to, declare, war, in, 149, bc, starting, the, third, punic, war, this, conflict, was, fought, entirely, on, carthage, s, territories, in, what, is, now, tunisia, and, centred, on, the, siege, of, carthage, in, 146, bc, the, romans, stormed, the, city, of, carthage, sacked, it, slaughtered, or, enslaved, most, of, its, population, and, completely, demolished, the, city, the, carthaginian, territories, were, taken, over, as, the, roman, province, of, africa, the, ruins, of, the, city, lie, east, of, modern, tunis, on, the, north, african, coast, the, most, reliable, source, for, the, punic, wars, is, the, historian, polybius, c, 200, c, 118, bc, a, greek, sent, to, rome, in, 167, bc, as, a, hostage, he, is, best, known, for, the, histories, written, sometime, after, 146, bc, polybius, s, work, is, considered, broadly, objective, and, largely, neutral, between, carthaginian, and, roman, points, of, view, polybius, was, an, analytical, historian, and, wherever, possible, interviewed, participants, from, both, sides, in, the, events, he, wrote, about, modern, historians, consider, polybius, to, have, treated, the, relatives, of, scipio, aemilianus, his, patron, and, friend, unduly, favourably, but, the, consensus, is, to, accept, his, account, largely, at, face, value, the, modern, historian, andrew, curry, sees, polybius, as, being, fairly, reliable, craige, champion, describes, him, as, a, remarkably, well, informed, industrious, and, insightful, historian, the, details, of, the, war, in, modern, sources, are, largely, based, on, interpretations, of, polybius, s, account, the, account, of, the, roman, historian, livy, is, commonly, used, by, modern, historians, where, polybius, s, account, is, not, extant, livy, relied, heavily, on, polybius, but, wrote, in, a, more, structured, way, with, more, details, about, roman, politics, as, well, as, being, openly, pro, roman, his, accounts, of, military, encounters, are, often, demonstrably, inaccurate, the, classicist, adrian, goldsworthy, says, livy, s, reliability, is, often, suspect, and, the, historian, philip, sabin, refers, to, livy, s, military, ignorance, later, ancient, histories, of, the, wars, also, exist, in, fragmentary, or, summary, form, modern, historians, usually, take, into, account, the, writings, of, various, roman, annalists, some, contemporary, the, sicilian, greek, diodorus, siculus, and, the, later, roman, historians, plutarch, appian, and, dio, cassius, goldsworthy, writes, polybius, account, is, usually, to, be, preferred, when, it, differs, with, any, of, our, other, accounts, other, sources, include, coins, inscriptions, archaeological, evidence, and, empirical, evidence, from, reconstructions, such, as, the, trireme, olympias, the, roman, republic, had, been, aggressively, expanding, in, the, southern, italian, mainland, for, a, century, before, the, first, punic, war, it, had, conquered, peninsular, italy, south, of, the, arno, river, by, 270, bc, when, the, greek, cities, of, southern, italy, magna, graecia, submitted, after, the, conclusion, of, the, pyrrhic, war, during, this, period, of, roman, expansion, carthage, with, its, capital, in, what, is, now, tunisia, had, come, to, dominate, southern, iberia, much, of, the, coastal, regions, of, north, africa, the, balearic, islands, corsica, sardinia, and, the, western, half, of, sicily, in, a, thalassocracy, beginning, in, 480, bc, carthage, fought, a, series, of, inconclusive, wars, against, the, greek, city, states, of, sicily, led, by, syracuse, by, 264, bc, carthage, was, the, dominant, external, power, on, the, island, and, carthage, and, rome, were, the, preeminent, powers, in, the, western, mediterranean, relationships, were, good, and, the, two, states, had, several, times, declared, their, mutual, friendship, in, formal, alliances, in, 509, bc, 348, bc, and, around, 279, bc, there, were, strong, commercial, links, during, the, pyrrhic, war, of, 280, 275, bc, against, a, king, of, epirus, who, alternately, fought, rome, in, italy, and, carthage, on, sicily, carthage, provided, materiel, to, the, romans, and, on, at, least, one, occasion, provided, its, navy, to, ferry, a, roman, force, according, to, the, classicist, richard, miles, rome, had, an, expansionary, attitude, after, its, conquest, of, southern, italy, while, carthage, had, a, proprietary, approach, to, sicily, the, conflict, between, these, policies, pushed, the, two, powers, to, stumble, into, war, more, by, accident, than, design, the, spark, that, ignited, the, first, punic, war, in, 264, bc, was, the, issue, of, control, of, the, independent, sicilian, city, state, of, messana, modern, messina, most, male, roman, citizens, were, liable, for, military, service, and, would, serve, as, infantry, with, a, better, off, minority, providing, a, cavalry, component, traditionally, when, at, war, the, romans, would, raise, two, legions, each, of, 4, 200, infantry, and, 300, cavalry, approximately, 1, 200, members, of, the, infantry, poorer, or, younger, men, unable, to, afford, the, armour, and, equipment, of, a, standard, legionary, served, as, javelin, armed, skirmishers, known, as, velites, they, each, carried, several, javelins, which, would, be, thrown, from, a, distance, as, well, as, a, short, sword, and, a, 90, centimetre, 3, ft, shield, the, rest, of, the, soldiers, were, equipped, as, heavy, infantry, with, body, armour, a, large, shield, and, short, thrusting, swords, they, were, divided, into, three, ranks, the, front, rank, also, carried, two, javelins, while, the, second, and, third, ranks, had, a, thrusting, spear, instead, both, legionary, sub, units, and, individual, legionaries, fought, in, relatively, open, order, it, was, the, long, standing, roman, procedure, to, elect, two, men, each, year, as, senior, magistrates, known, as, consuls, who, in, a, time, of, war, would, each, lead, an, army, an, army, was, usually, formed, by, combining, a, roman, legion, with, a, similarly, sized, and, equipped, legion, provided, by, their, latin, allies, allied, legions, usually, had, a, larger, attached, complement, of, cavalry, than, roman, ones, carthaginian, citizens, only, served, in, their, army, if, there, was, a, direct, threat, to, the, city, of, carthage, when, they, did, they, fought, as, well, armoured, heavy, infantry, armed, with, long, thrusting, spears, although, they, were, notoriously, ill, trained, and, ill, disciplined, in, most, circumstances, carthage, recruited, foreigners, to, make, up, its, army, many, were, from, north, africa, and, these, were, frequently, referred, to, as, libyans, the, region, provided, several, types, of, fighters, including, close, order, infantry, equipped, with, large, shields, helmets, short, swords, and, long, thrusting, spears, javelin, armed, light, infantry, skirmishers, close, order, shock, cavalry, also, known, as, heavy, cavalry, carrying, spears, and, light, cavalry, skirmishers, who, threw, javelins, from, a, distance, and, avoided, close, combat, the, latter, were, usually, numidians, the, close, order, african, infantry, and, the, citizen, militia, both, fought, in, a, tightly, packed, formation, known, as, a, phalanx, on, occasion, some, of, the, infantry, would, wear, captured, roman, armour, especially, among, the, troops, of, the, carthaginian, general, hannibal, in, addition, both, iberia, and, gaul, provided, many, experienced, infantry, and, cavalry, the, infantry, from, these, areas, were, unarmoured, troops, who, would, charge, ferociously, but, had, a, reputation, for, breaking, off, if, a, combat, was, protracted, the, gallic, cavalry, and, possibly, some, of, the, iberians, wore, armour, and, fought, as, close, order, troops, most, or, all, of, the, mounted, iberians, were, light, cavalry, slingers, were, frequently, recruited, from, the, balearic, islands, the, carthaginians, also, employed, war, elephants, north, africa, had, indigenous, african, forest, elephants, at, the, time, garrison, duty, and, land, blockades, were, the, most, common, operations, when, armies, were, campaigning, surprise, attacks, ambushes, and, stratagems, were, common, more, formal, battles, were, usually, preceded, by, the, two, armies, camping, two, twelve, kilometres, 1, 7, miles, apart, for, days, or, weeks, sometimes, both, forming, up, in, battle, order, each, day, if, either, commander, felt, at, a, disadvantage, they, might, march, off, without, engaging, in, such, circumstances, it, was, difficult, to, force, a, battle, if, the, other, commander, was, unwilling, to, fight, forming, up, in, battle, order, was, a, complicated, and, premeditated, affair, which, took, several, hours, infantry, were, usually, positioned, in, the, centre, of, the, battle, line, with, light, infantry, skirmishers, to, their, front, and, cavalry, on, each, flank, many, battles, were, decided, when, one, side, s, infantry, force, was, attacked, in, the, flank, or, rear, and, they, were, partially, or, wholly, enveloped, quinqueremes, meaning, five, oarsmen, provided, the, workhorses, of, the, roman, and, carthaginian, fleets, throughout, the, punic, wars, so, ubiquitous, was, the, type, that, polybius, uses, it, as, a, shorthand, for, warship, in, general, a, quinquereme, carried, a, crew, of, 300, 280, oarsmen, and, 20, deck, crew, and, officers, it, would, also, normally, carry, a, complement, of, 40, marines, if, battle, was, thought, to, be, imminent, this, would, be, increased, to, as, many, as, 120, in, 260, bc, romans, set, out, to, construct, a, fleet, and, used, a, shipwrecked, carthaginian, quinquereme, as, a, blueprint, for, their, own, as, novice, shipwrights, the, romans, built, copies, that, were, heavier, than, the, carthaginian, vessels, thus, they, were, slower, and, less, manoeuvrable, getting, the, oarsmen, to, row, as, a, unit, let, alone, to, execute, more, complex, battle, manoeuvres, required, long, and, arduous, training, at, least, half, of, the, oarsmen, would, need, to, have, had, some, experience, if, the, ship, was, to, be, handled, effectively, as, a, result, the, romans, were, initially, at, a, disadvantage, against, the, more, experienced, carthaginians, to, counter, this, the, romans, introduced, the, corvus, a, bridge, 1, 2, metres, 4, feet, wide, and, 11, metres, 36, feet, long, with, a, heavy, spike, on, the, underside, which, was, designed, to, pierce, and, anchor, into, an, enemy, ship, s, deck, this, allowed, roman, legionaries, acting, as, marines, to, board, enemy, ships, and, capture, them, rather, than, employing, the, previously, traditional, tactic, of, ramming, all, warships, were, equipped, with, rams, a, triple, set, of, 60, centimetre, wide, 2, ft, bronze, blades, weighing, up, to, 270, kilograms, 600, lb, positioned, at, the, waterline, in, the, century, prior, to, the, punic, wars, boarding, had, become, increasingly, common, and, ramming, had, declined, as, the, larger, and, heavier, vessels, adopted, in, this, period, increasingly, lacked, the, speed, and, manoeuvrability, necessary, to, ram, effectively, while, their, sturdier, construction, reduced, a, ram, s, effect, on, them, even, in, case, of, a, successful, attack, the, roman, adaptation, of, the, corvus, was, a, continuation, of, this, trend, and, compensated, for, their, initial, disadvantage, in, ship, manoeuvring, skills, the, added, weight, in, the, prow, compromised, both, the, ship, s, manoeuvrability, and, its, seaworthiness, and, in, rough, sea, conditions, the, corvus, became, useless, part, way, through, the, first, punic, war, the, romans, ceased, using, it, much, of, the, first, punic, war, was, fought, on, or, in, the, waters, near, sicily, away, from, the, coasts, its, hilly, and, rugged, terrain, made, manoeuvring, large, forces, difficult, and, so, encouraged, defensive, strategies, land, operations, were, largely, confined, to, raids, sieges, and, interdiction, in, 23, years, of, war, on, sicily, there, were, only, two, full, scale, pitched, battles, the, war, began, with, the, romans, gaining, a, foothold, on, sicily, at, messana, modern, messina, in, 264, bc, they, then, pressed, syracuse, the, only, significant, independent, power, on, the, island, into, allying, with, them, and, laid, siege, to, carthage, s, main, base, at, akragas, on, the, south, coast, a, carthaginian, army, of, 50, 000, infantry, 6, 000, cavalry, and, 60, elephants, attempted, to, lift, the, siege, in, 262, bc, but, was, badly, defeated, at, the, battle, of, akragas, that, night, the, carthaginian, garrison, escaped, and, the, romans, seized, the, city, and, its, inhabitants, selling, 25, 000, of, them, into, slavery, after, this, the, land, war, on, sicily, reached, a, stalemate, as, the, carthaginians, focused, on, defending, their, well, fortified, towns, and, cities, these, were, mostly, on, the, coast, and, so, could, be, supplied, and, reinforced, without, the, romans, being, able, to, use, their, superior, army, to, interfere, the, focus, of, the, war, shifted, to, the, sea, where, the, romans, had, little, experience, on, the, few, occasions, they, had, previously, felt, the, need, for, a, naval, presence, they, had, usually, relied, on, small, squadrons, provided, by, their, latin, or, greek, allies, the, romans, built, a, navy, to, challenge, carthage, s, and, using, the, corvus, inflicted, a, major, defeat, at, the, battle, of, mylae, in, 260, bc, a, carthaginian, base, on, corsica, was, seized, but, an, attack, on, sardinia, was, repulsed, the, base, on, corsica, was, then, lost, in, 258, bc, a, roman, fleet, defeated, a, smaller, carthaginian, fleet, at, the, battle, of, sulci, off, the, western, coast, of, sardinia, taking, advantage, of, their, naval, victories, the, romans, launched, an, invasion, of, north, africa, in, 256, bc, which, the, carthaginians, intercepted, at, the, battle, of, cape, ecnomus, off, the, southern, coast, of, sicily, the, carthaginian, s, superior, seamanship, was, not, as, effective, as, they, had, hoped, while, the, romans, corvus, gave, them, an, edge, as, the, battle, degenerated, into, a, shapeless, brawl, the, carthaginians, were, again, beaten, this, was, possibly, the, largest, naval, battle, in, history, by, the, number, of, combatants, involved, the, invasion, initially, went, well, and, in, 255, bc, the, carthaginians, sued, for, peace, the, proposed, terms, were, so, harsh, they, decided, to, fight, on, at, the, battle, of, tunis, in, spring, 255, bc, a, combined, force, of, infantry, cavalry, and, war, elephants, under, the, command, of, the, spartan, mercenary, xanthippus, crushed, the, romans, the, romans, sent, a, fleet, to, evacuate, their, survivors, and, the, carthaginians, opposed, it, at, the, battle, of, cape, hermaeum, modern, cape, bon, the, carthaginians, were, again, heavily, defeated, the, roman, fleet, in, turn, was, devastated, by, a, storm, while, returning, to, italy, losing, most, of, its, ships, and, more, than, 100, 000, men, it, is, possible, that, the, presence, of, the, corvus, making, the, roman, ships, unusually, unseaworthy, contributed, to, this, disaster, there, is, no, record, of, them, being, used, again, the, war, continued, with, neither, side, able, to, gain, a, decisive, advantage, the, carthaginians, attacked, and, recaptured, akragas, in, 255, bc, but, not, believing, they, could, hold, the, city, they, razed, and, abandoned, it, the, romans, rapidly, rebuilt, their, fleet, adding, 220, new, ships, and, captured, panormus, modern, palermo, in, 254, bc, the, next, year, they, lost, another, 150, ships, to, a, storm, on, sicily, the, romans, avoided, battle, in, 252, and, 251, bc, according, to, polybius, because, they, feared, the, war, elephants, which, the, carthaginians, had, shipped, to, the, island, in, 250, bc, the, carthaginians, advanced, on, panormus, but, in, a, battle, outside, the, walls, the, romans, drove, off, the, carthaginian, elephants, with, javelins, the, elephants, routed, through, the, carthaginian, infantry, who, were, then, charged, by, the, roman, infantry, to, complete, their, defeat, slowly, the, romans, had, occupied, most, of, sicily, in, 250, bc, they, besieged, the, last, two, carthaginian, strongholds, lilybaeum, and, drepana, in, the, extreme, west, repeated, attempts, to, storm, lilybaeum, s, strong, walls, failed, as, did, attempts, to, block, access, to, its, harbour, and, the, romans, settled, down, to, a, siege, which, was, to, last, nine, years, they, launched, a, surprise, attack, on, the, carthaginian, fleet, but, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, drepana, carthage, s, greatest, naval, victory, of, the, war, carthage, turned, to, the, maritime, offensive, inflicting, another, heavy, naval, defeat, at, the, battle, of, phintias, and, all, but, swept, the, romans, from, the, sea, it, was, to, be, seven, years, before, rome, again, attempted, to, field, a, substantial, fleet, while, carthage, put, most, of, its, ships, into, reserve, to, save, money, and, free, up, manpower, after, more, than, 20, years, of, war, both, states, were, financially, and, demographically, exhausted, evidence, of, carthage, s, financial, situation, includes, their, request, for, a, 2, 000, talent, loan, from, ptolemaic, egypt, which, was, refused, rome, was, also, close, to, bankruptcy, and, the, number, of, adult, male, citizens, who, provided, the, manpower, for, the, navy, and, the, legions, had, declined, by, 17, per, cent, since, the, start, of, the, war, historian, adrian, goldsworthy, 2006, has, described, roman, manpower, losses, as, appalling, the, romans, rebuilt, their, fleet, again, in, 243, bc, after, the, senate, approached, rome, s, wealthiest, citizens, for, loans, to, finance, the, construction, of, one, ship, each, repayable, from, the, reparations, to, be, imposed, on, carthage, once, the, war, was, won, this, new, fleet, effectively, blockaded, the, carthaginian, garrisons, carthage, assembled, a, fleet, which, attempted, to, relieve, them, but, it, was, destroyed, at, the, battle, of, the, aegates, islands, in, 241, bc, forcing, the, cut, off, carthaginian, troops, on, sicily, to, negotiate, for, peace, the, treaty, of, lutatius, was, agreed, by, which, carthage, paid, 3, 200, talents, of, silver, in, reparations, and, sicily, was, annexed, as, a, roman, province, polybius, regarded, the, war, as, the, longest, most, continuous, and, most, severely, contested, war, known, to, us, in, history, henceforth, rome, considered, itself, the, leading, military, power, in, the, western, mediterranean, and, increasingly, the, mediterranean, region, as, a, whole, the, immense, effort, of, repeatedly, building, large, fleets, of, galleys, during, the, war, laid, the, foundation, for, rome, s, maritime, dominance, which, was, to, last, 600, years, the, mercenary, or, truceless, war, began, in, 241, bc, as, a, dispute, over, the, payment, of, wages, owed, to, 20, 000, foreign, soldiers, who, had, fought, for, carthage, on, sicily, during, the, first, punic, war, this, erupted, into, full, scale, mutiny, under, the, leadership, of, spendius, and, matho, 70, 000, africans, from, carthage, s, oppressed, dependant, territories, flocked, to, join, the, mutineers, bringing, supplies, and, finance, war, weary, carthage, fared, poorly, in, the, initial, engagements, especially, under, the, generalship, of, hanno, hamilcar, barca, a, veteran, of, the, campaigns, in, sicily, was, given, joint, command, of, the, army, in, 240, bc, and, supreme, command, in, 239, bc, he, campaigned, successfully, initially, demonstrating, leniency, in, an, attempt, to, woo, the, rebels, over, to, prevent, this, in, 240, bc, spendius, tortured, 700, carthaginian, prisoners, to, death, and, henceforth, the, war, was, pursued, with, great, brutality, by, early, 237, bc, after, numerous, setbacks, the, rebels, were, defeated, and, their, cities, brought, back, under, carthaginian, rule, an, expedition, was, prepared, to, reoccupy, sardinia, where, mutinous, soldiers, had, slaughtered, all, carthaginians, the, roman, senate, stated, they, considered, the, preparation, of, this, force, an, act, of, war, and, demanded, carthage, cede, sardinia, and, corsica, and, pay, an, additional, 1, 200, talent, indemnity, weakened, by, 30, years, of, war, carthage, agreed, rather, than, again, enter, into, conflict, with, rome, polybius, considered, this, contrary, to, all, justice, and, modern, historians, have, variously, described, the, romans, behaviour, as, unprovoked, aggression, and, treaty, breaking, shamelessly, opportunistic, and, an, unscrupulous, act, these, events, fuelled, resentment, of, rome, in, carthage, which, was, not, reconciled, to, rome, s, perception, of, its, situation, this, breach, of, the, recently, signed, treaty, is, considered, by, modern, historians, to, be, the, single, greatest, cause, of, war, with, carthage, breaking, out, again, in, 218, bc, in, the, second, punic, war, with, the, suppression, of, the, rebellion, hamilcar, understood, that, carthage, needed, to, strengthen, its, economic, and, military, base, if, it, were, to, again, confront, rome, after, the, first, punic, war, carthaginian, possessions, in, iberia, modern, spain, and, portugal, were, limited, to, a, handful, of, prosperous, coastal, cities, in, the, south, hamilcar, took, the, army, which, he, had, led, in, the, mercenary, war, to, iberia, in, 237, bc, and, carved, out, a, quasi, monarchial, autonomous, state, in, its, south, east, this, gave, carthage, the, silver, mines, agricultural, wealth, manpower, military, facilities, such, as, shipyards, and, territorial, depth, to, stand, up, to, future, roman, demands, with, confidence, hamilcar, ruled, as, a, viceroy, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, in, law, hasdrubal, in, the, early, 220s, bc, and, then, his, son,

introduced, the, fabian, strategy, of, avoiding, open, battle, with, his, opponent, but, constantly, skirmishing, with, small, detachments, of, the, enemy, this, was, not, popular, with, parts, of, the, roman, army, public, and, senate, since, he, avoided, battle, while, italy, was, being, devastated, by, the, enemy, hannibal, marched, through, the, richest, and, most, fertile, provinces, of, italy, hoping, the, devastation, would, draw, fabius, into, battle, but, fabius, refused, in, the, 216, bc, elections, gaius, varro, and, lucius, paullus, were, elected, as, consuls, both, were, more, aggressive, minded, than, fabius, the, roman, senate, authorised, the, raising, of, a, force, of, 86, 000, men, the, largest, in, roman, history, to, that, point, paullus, and, varro, marched,

samnite, tribes, also, joined, the, carthaginian, cause, by, 214, bc, the, bulk, of, southern, italy, had, turned, against, rome, although, there, were, many, exceptions, the, majority, of, rome, s, allies, in, central, italy, remained, loyal, all, except, the, smallest, towns, were, too, well, fortified, for, hannibal, to, take, by, assault, and, blockade, could, be, a, long, drawn, out, affair, or, if, the, target, was, a, port, impossible, carthage, s, new, allies, felt, little, sense, of, community, with, carthage, or, even, with, each, other, the, new, allies, increased, the, number, of, places, that, hannibal, s, army, was, expected, to, defend, from, roman, retribution, but, provided, relatively, few, fresh, troops, to, assist, him, in, doing, so, such, italian, forces, as, were, raised, resisted, operating, away, from, their, home, cities, and, performed, poorly, when, they, did, when, the, port, city, of, locri, defected, to, carthage, in, the, summer, of, 215, bc, it, was, immediately, used, to, reinforce, the, carthaginian, forces, in, italy, with, soldiers, supplies, and, war, elephants, it, was, the, only, time, during, the, war, that, carthage, reinforced, hannibal, a, second, force, under, hannibal, s, youngest, brother, mago, was, meant, to, land, in, italy, in, 215, bc, but, was, diverted, to, iberia, after, the, carthaginian, defeat, there, at, the, battle, of, dertosa, meanwhile, the, romans, took, drastic, steps, to, raise, new, legions, enrolling, slaves, criminals, and, those, who, did, not, meet, the, usual, property, qualification, by, early, 215, bc, they, were, fielding, at, least, 12, legions, by, 214, bc, 18, and, by, 213, bc, 22, by, 212, bc, the, full, complement, of, the, legions, deployed, would, have, been, in, excess, of, 100, 000, men, plus, as, always, a, similar, number, of, allied, troops, the, majority, were, deployed, in, southern, italy, in, field, armies, of, approximately, 20, 000, men, each, this, was, insufficient, to, challenge, hannibal, s, army, in, open, battle, but, sufficient, to, force, him, to, concentrate, his, forces, and, to, hamper, his, movements, for, 12, years, after, cannae, the, war, surged, around, southern, italy, as, cities, went, over, to, the, carthaginians, or, were, taken, by, subterfuge, and, the, romans, recaptured, them, by, siege, or, by, suborning, pro, roman, factions, hannibal, repeatedly, defeated, roman, armies, in, 209, bc, both, consuls, were, killed, in, a, cavalry, skirmish, but, wherever, his, main, army, was, not, active, the, romans, threatened, carthaginian, supporting, towns, or, sought, battle, with, carthaginian, or, carthaginian, allied, detachments, frequently, with, success, by, 207, bc, hannibal, had, been, confined, to, the, extreme, south, of, italy, and, many, of, the, cities, and, territories, which, had, joined, the, carthaginian, cause, had, returned, to, their, roman, allegiance, during, 216, bc, the, macedonian, king,

league, a, coalition, of, greek, city, states, which, was, already, at, war, against, macedonia, in, 205, bc, this, war, ended, with, a, negotiated, peace, a, rebellion, in, support, of, the, carthaginians, broke, out, on, sardinia, in, 213, bc, but, it, was, quickly, put, down, by, the, romans, up, to, 215, bc, sicily, remained, firmly, in, roman, hands, blocking, the, ready, seaborne,

successor, hieronymus, was, discontented, with, his, situation, hannibal, negotiated, a, treaty, whereby, syracuse, defected, to, carthage, in, exchange, for, making, the, whole, of, sicily, a, syracusan, possession, the, syracusan, army, proved, no, match, for, a, roman, army, led, by, claudius, marcellus, and, by, spring, 213, bc, syracuse, was, besieged, the, siege, was, marked, by, the, ingenuity, of, archimedes, in, inventing, war, machines, to, counteract, the, traditional, siege, warfare, methods, of, the, romans, a, large, carthaginian, army, led, by, himilco, was, sent, to, relieve, the, city, in, 213, bc, it, captured, several, roman, garrisoned, towns, on, sicily, many, roman, garrisons, were, either, expelled, or, massacred, by, carthaginian, partisans, in, spring, 212, bc, the, romans, stormed, syracuse, in, a, surprise, night, assault, and, captured, several, districts, of, the, city, meanwhile, the, carthaginian, army, was, crippled, by, plague, after, the, carthaginians, failed, to, resupply, the, city, syracuse, fell, that, autumn, archimedes, was, killed, by, a, roman, soldier, carthage, sent, more, reinforcements, to, sicily, in, 211, bc, and, went, on, the, offensive, a, fresh, roman, army, attacked, the, main, carthaginian, stronghold, on, the, island, agrigentum, in, 210, bc, and, the, city, was, betrayed, to, the, romans, by, a, discontented, carthaginian, officer, the, remaining, carthaginian, controlled, towns, then, surrendered, or, were, taken, through, force, or, treachery, and, the, sicilian, grain, supply, to, rome, and, its, armies, was, secured, in, the, spring, of, 207, bc, hasdrubal, barca, repeated, the, feat, of, his, elder, brother, by, marching, an, army, of, 35, 000, men, across, the, alps, and, invading, italy, his, aim, was, to, join, his, forces, with, those, of, hannibal, but, hannibal, was, unaware, of, his, presence, the, romans, facing, hannibal, in, southern, italy, tricked, him, into, believing, the, whole, roman, army, was, still, in, camp, while, a, large, portion, marched, north, under, the, consul, claudius, nero, and, reinforced, the, romans, facing, hasdrubal, who, were, commanded, by, the, other, consul, marcus, salinator, the, combined, roman, force, attacked, hasdrubal, at, the, battle, of, the, metaurus, and, destroyed, his, army, killing, hasdrubal, this, battle, confirmed, roman, dominance, in, italy, and, marked, the, end, of, their, fabian, strategy, in, 205, bc, mago, landed, in, genua, in, north, west, italy, with, the, remnants, of, his, spanish, army, see, iberia, below, where, it, received, gallic, and, ligurian, reinforcements, mago, s, arrival, in, the, north, of, the, italian, peninsula, was, followed, by, hannibal, s, inconclusive, battle, of, crotona, in, 204, bc, in, the, far, south, of, the, peninsula, mago, marched, his, reinforced, army, towards, the, lands, of, carthage, s, main, gallic, allies, in, the, po, valley, but, was, checked, by, a, large, roman, army, and, defeated, at, the, battle, of, insubria, in, 203, bc, after, publius, cornelius, scipio, invaded, the, carthaginian, homeland, in, 204, bc, defeating, the, carthaginians, in, two, major, battles, and, winning, the, allegiance, of, the, numidian, kingdoms, of, north, africa, hannibal, and, the, remnants, of, his, army, were, recalled, they, sailed, from, croton, and, landed, at,

route, from, iberia, to, italy, and, greatly, hindered, the, despatch, of, reinforcements, from, iberia, to, hannibal, the, carthaginian, commander, in, iberia, hannibal, s, brother, hasdrubal, marched, into, this, area, in, 215, bc, offered, battle, and, was, defeated, at, dertosa, although, both, sides, suffered, heavy, casualties, the, carthaginians, suffered, a, wave, of, defections, of, local, celtiberian, tribes, to, rome, the, roman, commanders, captured, saguntum, in, 212, bc, and, in, 211, bc, hired, 20, 000, celtiberian, mercenaries, to, reinforce, their, army, observing, that, the, three, carthaginian, armies, were, deployed, apart, from, each, other, the, romans, split, their, forces, this, strategy, resulted, in, two, separate, battles, in, 211, bc, usually, referred, to, jointly, as, the, battle, of, the, upper, baetis, both, battles, ended, in, complete, defeat, for, the, romans, as, hasdrubal, had, bribed, the, romans, mercenaries, to, desert, the, romans, retreated, to, their, coastal, stronghold, north, of, the, ebro, from, which, the, carthaginians, again, failed, to, expel, them, claudius, nero, brought, over, reinforcements, in, 210, bc, and, stabilised, the, situation, in, 210, bc, publius, cornelius, scipio, arrived, in, iberia, with, further, roman, reinforcements, in, a, carefully, planned, assault, in, 209, bc, he, captured, cartago,

liberated, the, iberian, hostages, who, had, been, held, there, by, the, carthaginians, to, ensure, the, loyalty, of, their, tribes, even, so, many, of, them, later, fought, against, the, romans, in, the, spring, of, 208, bc, hasdrubal, moved, to, engage, scipio, at, the, battle, of, baecula, the, carthaginians, were, defeated, but, hasdrubal, was, able, to, withdraw, the, majority, of, his, army, and, prevent, any, roman, pursuit, most, of, his, losses, were, among, his, iberian, allies, scipio, was, not, able, to, prevent, hasdrubal, from, leading, his, depleted, army, through, the, western, passes, of, the, pyrenees, into, gaul, in, 207, bc, after, recruiting, heavily, in, gaul, hasdrubal, crossed, the, alps, into, italy, in, an, attempt, to, join, his, brother, hannibal, but, was, defeated, before, he, could, in, 206, bc, at, the, battle, of, ilipa, scipio, with, 48, 000, men, half, italian, and, half, iberian, defeated, a, carthaginian, army, of, 54, 500, men, and, 32, elephants, this, sealed, the, fate, of, the, carthaginians, in, iberia, the, last, carthaginian, held, city, in, iberia, gades, defected, to, the, romans, later, the, same, year, a, mutiny, broke, out, among, roman, troops, which, attracted, support, from, iberian, leaders, disappointed, that, roman, forces, had, remained, in, the, peninsula, after, the, expulsion, of, the, carthaginians, but, it, was, effectively, put, down, by, scipio, in, 205, bc, a, last, attempt, was, made, by, mago, to, recapture, new, carthage, when, the, roman, occupiers, were, shaken, by, another, mutiny, and, an, iberian, uprising, but, he, was, repulsed, mago, left, iberia, for, cisalpine, gaul, with, his, remaining, forces, in, 203, bc, carthage, succeeded, in, recruiting, at, least, 4, 000, mercenaries, from, iberia, despite, rome, s, nominal, control, in, 213, bc, syphax, a, powerful, numidian, king, in, north, africa, declared, for, rome, in, response, roman, advisers, were, sent, to, train, his, soldiers, and, he, waged, war, against, the, carthaginian, ally, gala, in, 206, bc, the, carthaginians, ended, this, drain, on, their, resources, by, dividing, several, numidian, kingdoms, with, him, one, of, those, disinherited, was, the, numidian, prince, masinissa, who, was, thus, driven, into, the, arms, of, rome, in, 205, bc, publius, scipio, was, given, command, of, the, legions, in, sicily, and, allowed, to, enrol, volunteers, for, his, plan, to, end, the, war, by, an, invasion, of, africa, after, landing, in, africa, in, 204, bc, he, was, joined, by, masinissa, and, a, force, of, numidian, cavalry, scipio, gave, battle, to, and, destroyed, two, large, carthaginian, armies, after, the, second, of, these, syphax, was, pursued, and, taken, prisoner, by, masinissa, at, the, battle, of, cirta, masinissa, then, seized, most, of, syphax, s, kingdom, with, roman, help, rome, and, carthage, entered, into, peace, negotiations, and, carthage, recalled, hannibal, from, italy, the, roman, senate, ratified, a, draft, treaty, but, because, of, mistrust, and, a, surge, in, confidence, when, hannibal, arrived, from, italy, carthage, repudiated, it, hannibal, was, placed, in, command, of, an, army, formed, from, his, and, mago, s, veterans, from, italy, and, newly, raised, troops, from, africa, but, with, few, cavalry, the, decisive, battle, of, zama, followed, in, october, 202, bc, unlike, most, battles, of, the, second, punic, war, the, romans, had, superiority, in, cavalry, and, the, carthaginians, in, infantry, hannibal, attempted, to, use, 80, elephants, to, break, into, the, roman, infantry, formation, but, the, romans, countered, them, effectively, and, they, routed, back, through, the, carthaginian, ranks, the, roman, and, allied, numidian, cavalry, then, pressed, their, attacks, and, drove, the, carthaginian, cavalry, from, the, field, the, two, sides, infantry, fought, inconclusively, until, the, roman, cavalry, returned, and, attacked, the, carthaginian, rear, the, carthaginian, formation, collapsed, hannibal, was, one, of, the, few, to, escape, the, field, the, new, peace, treaty, dictated, by, rome, stripped, carthage, of, all, of, its, overseas, territories, and, some, of, its, african, ones, an, indemnity, of, 10, 000, silver, talents, was, to, be, paid, over, 50, years, hostages, were, to, be, taken, carthage, was, forbidden, to, possess, war, elephants, and, its, fleet, was, restricted, to, 10, warships, it, was, prohibited, from, waging, war, outside, africa, and, in, africa, only, with, rome, s, express, permission, many, senior, carthaginians, wanted, to, reject, it, but, hannibal, spoke, strongly, in, its, favour, and, it, was, accepted, in, spring, 201, bc, henceforth, it, was, clear, that, carthage, was, politically, subordinate, to, rome, scipio, was, awarded, a, triumph, and, received, the, agnomen, africanus, under, the, pressure, of, the, war, the, romans, developed, an, increasingly, effective, system, of, logistics, to, equip, and, feed, the, unprecedented, numbers, of, soldiers, they, field, during, the, last, three, years, of, the, war, this, was, extended, to, the, transporting, by, sea, from, sicily, to, africa, of, almost, all, of, the, requirements, of, scipio, s, large, army, these, developments, made, possible, the, subsequent, roman, overseas, wars, of, conquest, at, the, end, of, the, war, masinissa, emerged, as, by, far, the, most, powerful, ruler, among, the, numidians, over, the, following, 48, years, he, repeatedly, took, advantage, of, carthage, s, inability, to, protect, its, possessions, whenever, carthage, petitioned, rome, for, redress, or, permission, to, take, military, action, rome, backed, its, ally, masinissa, and, refused, masinissa, s, seizures, of, and, raids, into, carthaginian, territory, became, increasingly, flagrant, in, 151, bc, carthage, raised, an, army, the, treaty, notwithstanding, and, counterattacked, the, numidians, the, campaign, ended, in, disaster, for, the, carthaginians, and, their, army, surrendered, carthage, had, paid, off, its, indemnity, and, was, prospering, economically, but, was, no, military, threat, to, rome, elements, in, the, roman, senate, had, long, wished, to, destroy, carthage, and, with, the, breach, of, the, treaty, as, a, casus, belli, war, was, declared, in, 149, bc, in, 149, bc, a, roman, army, of, approximately, 50, 000, men, jointly, commanded, by, both, consuls, landed, near, utica, 35, kilometres, 22, mi, north, of, carthage, rome, demanded, that, if, war, were, to, be, avoided, the, carthaginians, must, hand, over, all, of, their, armaments, vast, amounts, of, materiel, were, delivered, including, 200, 000, sets, of, armour, 2, 000, catapults, and, a,
