the, history, of, economic, thought, is, the, study, of, the, philosophies, of, the, different, thinkers, and, theories, in, the, subjects, that, later, became, political, economy, and, economics, from, the, ancient, world, to, the, present, day, this, field, encompasses, many, disparate, schools, of, economic, thought, ancient, greek, writers, such, as, the, philosopher, aristotle, examined, ideas, about, the, art, of, wealth, acquisition, and, questioned, whether, property, is, best, left, in, private, or, public, hands, in, the, middle, ages, thomas, aquinas, argued, that, it, was, a, moral, obligation, of, businesses, to, sell, goods, at, a, just, price, in, the, western, world, economics, was, not, a, separate, discipline, but, part, of, philosophy, until, the, 18th, 19th, century, industrial, revolution, and, the, 19th, century, great, divergence, which, accelerated, economic, growth, hesiod, active, 750, to, 650, bc, a, boeotian, who, wrote, the, earliest, known, work, concerning, the, basic, origins, of, economic, thought, contemporary, with, homer, of, the, 828, verses, in, his, poem, works, and, days, the, first, 383, centered, on, the, fundamental, economic, problem, of, scarce, resources, for, the, pursuit, of, numerous, and, abundant, human, ends, and, desires, fan, li, also, known, as, tao, zhu, gong, born, 517, bc, an, adviser, to, king, goujian, of, yue, wrote, on, economic, issues, and, developed, a, set, of, golden, business, rules, discourses, on, salt, and, iron, was, one, of, the, first, recorded, debates, of, state, intervention, and, laissez, faire, hindu, texts, vedas, 1700, 1100, bc, contain, economic, ideas, but, atharvaveda, 1200, bc, is, most, vocal, about, such, ideas, chanakya, born, 350, bc, of, the, maurya, empire, authored, the, arthashastra, along, with, several, indian, sages, a, treatise, on, statecraft, economic, policy, and, military, strategy, the, arthashastra, posits, the, theory, that, there, are, four, necessary, fields, of, knowledge, the, vedas, the, anvikshaki, philosophy, of, samkhya, yoga, and, lokayata, the, science, of, government, and, the, science, of, economics, varta, of, agriculture, cattle, and, trade, it, is, from, these, four, that, all, other, knowledge, wealth, and, human, prosperity, is, derived, ancient, athens, an, advanced, city, state, civilisation, and, progressive, society, developed, an, embryonic, model, of, democracy, xenophon, s, c, 430, 354, bc, oeconomicus, c, 360, bc, is, a, dialogue, principally, about, household, management, and, agriculture, plato, s, dialogue, the, republic, c, 380, 360, bc, describing, an, ideal, city, state, run, by, philosopher, kings, contained, references, to, specialization, of, labor, and, to, production, according, to, joseph, schumpeter, plato, was, the, first, known, advocate, of, a, credit, theory, of, money, that, is, money, as, a, unit, of, account, for, debt, plato, also, argued, that, collective, ownership, was, necessary, to, promote, common, pursuit, of, the, common, interest, and, to, avoid, the, social, divisiveness, that, would, occur, when, some, grieve, exceedingly, and, others, rejoice, at, the, same, happenings, aristotle, s, politics, c, 350, bc, analyzed, different, forms, of, the, state, monarchy, aristocracy, constitutional, government, tyranny, oligarchy, and, democracy, as, a, critique, of, plato, s, model, of, a, philosopher, kings, of, particular, interest, for, economists, plato, provided, a, blueprint, of, a, society, based, on, common, ownership, of, resources, aristotle, viewed, this, model, as, an, oligarchical, anathema, though, aristotle, did, certainly, advocate, holding, many, things, in, common, he, argued, that, not, everything, could, be, simply, because, of, the, wickedness, of, human, nature, it, is, clearly, better, that, property, should, be, private, wrote, aristotle, but, the, use, of, it, common, and, the, special, business, of, the, legislator, is, to, create, in, men, this, benevolent, disposition, in, politics, book, i, aristotle, discusses, the, general, nature, of, households, and, market, exchanges, for, him, there, is, a, certain, art, of, acquisition, or, wealth, getting, which, is, necessary, and, honourable, for, one, s, household, while, exchange, on, the, retail, trade, for, simply, accumulation, is, justly, censured, for, it, is, dishonorable, writing, of, the, people, aristotle, stated, that, they, as, a, whole, thought, acquisition, of, wealth, chrematistike, as, being, either, the, same, as, or, a, principle, of, oikonomia, household, management, oikonomos, with, oikos, meaning, house, and, with, themis, meaning, custom, nomos, meaning, law, aristotle, himself, highly, disapproved, of, usury, and, cast, scorn, on, making, money, through, a, monopoly, aristotle, discarded, plato, s, credit, theory, of, money, for, metallism, the, theory, that, money, derives, its, value, from, the, purchasing, power, of, the, commodity, upon, which, it, is, based, indeed, riches, is, assumed, by, many, to, be, only, a, quantity, of, coin, because, the, arts, of, getting, wealth, and, retail, trade, are, concerned, with, coin, others, maintain, that, coined, money, is, a, mere, sham, a, thing, not, natural, but, conventional, only, because, if, the, users, substitute, another, commodity, for, it, it, is, worthless, and, because, it, is, not, useful, as, a, means, to, any, of, the, necessities, of, life, and, indeed, he, who, is, rich, in, coin, may, often, be, in, want, of, necessary, food, but, how, can, that, be, wealth, of, which, a, man, may, have, a, great, abundance, and, yet, perish, with, hunger, like, midas, in, the, fable, whose, insatiable, prayer, turned, everything, that, was, set, before, him, into, gold, thomas, aquinas, 1225, 74, was, an, italian, theologian, and, economic, writer, he, taught, in, both, cologne, and, paris, and, was, part, of, a, group, of, catholic, scholars, known, as, the, schoolmen, who, moved, their, enquiries, beyond, theology, to, philosophical, and, scientific, debates, in, the, treatise, summa, theologica, aquinas, dealt, with, the, concept, of, a, just, price, which, he, considered, necessary, for, the, reproduction, of, the, social, order, similar, in, many, ways, to, the, modern, concept, of, long, run, equilibrium, a, just, price, was, just, sufficient, to, cover, the, costs, of, production, including, the, maintenance, of, a, worker, and, his, family, aquinas, argued, it, was, immoral, for, sellers, to, raise, their, prices, simply, because, buyers, had, a, pressing, need, for, a, product, aquinas, discusses, a, number, of, topics, in, the, format, of, questions, and, replies, substantial, tracts, dealing, with, aristotle, s, theory, questions, 77, and, 78, concern, economic, issues, primarily, what, a, just, price, might, be, and, the, fairness, of, a, seller, dispensing, faulty, goods, aquinas, argued, against, any, form, of, cheating, and, recommended, always, paying, compensation, in, lieu, of, service, obtained, as, it, utilized, resources, whilst, human, laws, might, not, impose, sanctions, for, unfair, dealing, divine, law, did, in, his, opinion, one, of, aquinas, main, critics, was, duns, scotus, 1265, 1308, originally, from, duns, scotland, who, taught, in, oxford, cologne, and, paris, in, his, work, sententiae, 1295, he, thought, it, possible, to, be, more, precise, than, aquinas, in, calculating, a, just, price, emphasizing, the, costs, of, labor, and, expenses, although, he, recognized, that, the, latter, might, be, inflated, by, exaggeration, because, buyer, and, seller, usually, have, different, ideas, of, a, just, price, if, people, did, not, benefit, from, a, transaction, in, scotus, view, they, would, not, trade, scotus, said, merchants, perform, a, necessary, and, useful, social, role, by, transporting, goods, and, making, them, available, to, the, public, jean, buridan, french, latin, johannes, buridanus, c, 1300, after, 1358, was, a, french, priest, buridanus, looked, at, money, from, two, angles, its, metal, value, and, its, purchasing, power, which, he, acknowledged, can, vary, he, argued, that, aggregated, not, individual, demand, and, supply, determine, market, prices, hence, for, him, a, just, price, was, what, the, society, collectively, and, not, just, one, individual, is, willing, to, pay, until, joseph, j, spengler, s, 1964, work, economic, thought, of, islam, ibn, khaldun, adam, smith, 1723, 1790, was, considered, the, father, of, economics, spengler, highlighted, the, work, of, arab, scholar, ibn, khaldun, 1332, 1406, of, tunisia, though, what, influence, khaldun, had, in, the, west, is, unclear, arnold, toynbee, called, ibn, khaldun, a, genius, who, appears, to, have, been, inspired, by, no, predecessors, and, to, have, found, no, kindred, souls, among, his, contemporaries, and, yet, in, the, prolegomena, muqaddimat, to, his, universal, history, he, has, conceived, and, formulated, a, philosophy, of, history, which, is, undoubtedly, the, greatest, work, of, its, kind, that, has, ever, yet, been, created, by, any, mind, in, any, time, or, place, ibn, khaldoun, expressed, a, theory, of, the, lifecycle, of, civilizations, the, specialization, of, labor, and, the, value, of, money, as, a, means, of, exchange, rather, than, as, a, store, of, inherent, value, his, ideas, on, taxes, were, similar, to, supply, side, economics, laffer, curve, which, posits, that, beyond, a, certain, point, higher, taxes, discourage, production, and, actually, cause, revenues, to, fall, french, philosopher, and, priest, nicolas, d, oresme, 1320, 1382, wrote, de, origine, natura, jure, et, mutationibus, monetarum, about, the, origin, nature, law, and, alterations, of, money, it, is, one, of, the, earliest, manuscripts, on, the, concept, of, money, his, treatise, argues, how, money, or, currency, belongs, to, the, public, and, that, the, government, or, sovereign, of, the, economy, has, no, right, to, control, the, value, of, the, currency, just, so, that, they, can, profit, from, it, saint, antoninus, of, florence, 1389, 1459, o, p, was, an, italian, dominican, friar, who, became, archbishop, of, florence, antoninus, writings, address, social, and, economic, development, and, argued, that, the, state, has, a, duty, to, intervene, in, mercantile, affairs, for, the, common, good, and, an, obligation, to, help, the, poor, and, needy, in, his, primary, work, summa, theologica, he, was, mainly, concerned, about, price, justice, and, capital, theory, like, duns, scotus, he, distinguishes, between, the, natural, value, of, a, good, and, its, practical, value, the, latter, is, determined, by, its, suitability, to, satisfy, needs, virtuositas, its, rarity, raritas, and, its, subjective, value, complacibilitas, due, to, this, subjective, component, there, cannot, only, be, one, just, price, but, a, bandwidth, of, more, or, less, just, prices, mercantilism, dominated, europe, from, the, 16th, to, the, 18th, century, despite, the, localism, of, the, middle, ages, the, waning, of, feudalism, saw, new, national, economic, frameworks, begin, to, strengthen, after, the, 15th, century, voyages, of, christopher, columbus, and, other, explorers, opened, up, new, opportunities, for, trade, with, the, new, world, and, asia, newly, powerful, monarchies, wanted, a, more, powerful, military, state, to, boost, their, status, mercantilism, was, a, political, movement, and, an, economic, theory, that, advocated, the, use, of, the, state, s, military, power, to, ensure, that, local, markets, and, supply, sources, were, protected, spawning, protectionism, mercantile, theorists, held, that, international, trade, could, not, benefit, all, countries, at, the, same, time, money, and, precious, metals, were, the, only, source, of, riches, in, their, view, and, limited, resources, must, be, allocated, between, countries, therefore, tariffs, should, be, used, to, encourage, exports, which, bring, money, into, the, country, and, discourage, imports, which, send, it, abroad, in, other, words, a, positive, balance, of, trade, ought, to, be, maintained, through, a, surplus, of, exports, often, backed, by, military, might, despite, the, prevalence, of, the, model, the, term, mercantilism, was, not, coined, until, 1763, by, victor, de, riqueti, marquis, de, mirabeau, 1715, 1789, and, popularized, by, adam, smith, in, 1776, who, vigorously, opposed, it, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, school, of, salamanca, in, spain, developed, economic, theory, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, a, study, in, the, economic, tradition, of, the, field, of, economics, even, if, his, doctrin, was, influenced, by, the, philosophy, of, thomas, aquinas, it, sometimes, renew, the, economic, thought, as, such, an, extent, that, it, was, defined, as, pro, market, pro, hard, money, anti, state, in, many, ways, pro, property, and, pro, merchant, to, a, surprising, extent, there, was, also, the, development, of, an, early, form, of, monetarism, in, response, to, the, introduction, of, new, world, gold, into, the, spanish, economy, with, their, reflexions, on, contract, law, and, fairness, in, exchange, the, members, of, the, school, of, salamanca, were, often, confronted, with, the, concept, of, value, thus, observing, the, effect, of, american, silver, and, gold, arrivals, in, spain, namely, lessening, of, their, values, and, augmentation, of, prices, mart, n, de, azpilcueta, established, the, idea, of, a, value, scarcity, first, form, of, the, quantity, theory, of, money, they, also, renewed, the, aquilian, concept, of, just, price, which, respects, the, principle, of, commutative, justice, but, depends, on, many, factors, the, just, price, have, a, certain, latitude, because, it, s, not, the, result, of, god, s, will, or, of, labor, but, of, the, common, estimation, of, the, people, communis, aestimatio, hominum, on, this, luis, saravia, de, la, calle, wrote, in, 1544, those, who, measure, the, just, price, by, the, labour, costs, and, risk, incurred, by, the, person, who, deals, in, the, merchandise, or, produces, it, or, by, the, cost, of, transport, or, the, expense, of, traveling, or, by, what, he, has, to, pay, the, factors, for, their, industry, risk, and, labour, are, greatly, in, error, for, the, just, price, arises, from, the, abundance, or, scarcity, of, goods, merchants, and, money, and, not, from, costs, labour, and, risk, why, should, a, bale, of, linen, brought, overland, from, brittany, at, great, expense, be, worth, more, than, one, which, is, transported, cheaply, by, sea, why, should, a, book, written, out, by, hand, be, worth, more, than, one, which, is, printed, when, the, latter, is, better, though, it, costs, less, to, produce, the, just, price, is, found, not, by, counting, the, cost, but, by, the, common, estimation, however, as, friedrich, hayek, has, written, the, school, rarely, followed, this, idea, through, systematically, his, members, thought, that, authories, were, sometimes, required, to, intervene, and, to, control, prices, especially, in, monopoly, cases, or, for, staples, the, opportunity, of, an, economic, interventionnism, called, arbitrism, wasn, t, unanimously, accepted, if, somes, thought, that, the, prince, concerned, of, public, interest, is, more, trustable, that, greedy, merchants, like, domingo, de, soto, and, tom, s, de, mercado, others, like, luis, de, molina, leonardus, lessius, or, juan, de, lugo, considered, that, any, intervention, of, the, authorities, is, inopportune, owing, to, the, corruption, and, the, clientelism, that, it, ll, created, sir, thomas, more, in, 1516, english, humanist, sir, thomas, more, 1478, 1535, published, utopia, which, describes, an, ideal, society, where, land, is, owned, in,

created, employment, for, the, poor, the, first, known, mention, of, underconsumption, theory, which, was, later, refined, by, john, maynard, keynes, leonardus, lessius, in, 1605, flemish, jesuit, theologian, leonardus, lessius, 1554, 1623, published, on, justice, and, law, the, deepest, moral, theological, study, of, economics, since, aquinas, whose, just, price, approach, he, claimed, was, no, longer, workable, after, comparing, money, s, growth, via, avarice, to, the, propagation, of, hares, he, made, the, first, statement, of, the, price, of, insurance, as, being, based, on, risk, edward, misselden, and, gerard, malynes, in, 1622, english, merchants, edward, misselden, and, gerard, malynes, began, a, dispute, over, free, trade, and, the, desirability, of, government, regulation, of, companies, with, malynes, arguing, against, foreign, exchange, as, under, the, control, of, bankers, and, misselden, arguing, that, international, money, exchange, and, fluctuations, in, the, exchange, rate, depend, upon, international, trade, and, not, bankers, and, that, the, state, should, regulate, trade, to, insure, export, surpluses, thomas, mun, english, economist, thomas,

including, robert, boyle, s, discovery, of, the, gas, pressure, constant, 1660, and, sir, isaac, newton, s, publication, of, philosophiae, naturalis, principia, mathematica, 1687, which, described, newton, s, laws, of, motion, and, his, universal, law, of, gravitation, all, these, factors, spurred, the, advancement, of, economic, thought, for, instance, richard, cantillon, 1680, 1734, consciously, imitated, newton, s, forces, of, inertia, and, gravity, in, the, natural, world, with, human, reason, and, market, competition, in, the, economic, world, in, his, essay, on, the, nature, of, commerce, in, general, he, argued, rational, self, interest, in, a, system, of, freely, adjusting, markets, would, lead, to, order, and, mutually, compatible, prices, unlike, the, mercantilist, thinkers, however, wealth, was, found, not, in, trade, but, in, human, labor, the, first, person, to, tie, these, ideas, into, a, political, framework, was, john, locke, john, locke, 1632, 1704, was, born, near, bristol, and, educated, in, london, and, oxford, he, is, considered, one, of, the, most, significant, philosophers, of, his, era, mainly, for, his, critique, of, thomas, hobbes, defense, of, absolutism, in, leviathan, 1651, and, of, his, social, contract, theory, locke, believed, that, people, contracted, into, society, which, was, bound, to, protect, their, property, rights, he, defined, property, broadly, to, include, people, s, lives, and, liberties, as, well, as, their, wealth, when, people, combined, their, labor, with, their, surroundings, that, created, property, rights, in, his, words, from, his, second, treatise, on, civil, government, 1689, god, hath, given, the, world, to, men, in, common, yet, every, man, has, a, property, in, his, own, person, the, labour, of, his, body, and, the, work, of, his, hands, we, may, say, are, properly, his, whatsoever, then, he, removes, out, of, the, state, that, nature, hath, provided, and, left, it, in, he, hath, mixed, his, labour, with, and, joined, to, it, something, that, is, his, own, and, thereby, makes, it, his, property, locke, argued, that, not, only, should, the, government, cease, interference, with, people, s, property, or, their, lives, liberties, and, estates, but, also, that, it, should, positively, work, to, ensure, their, protection, his, views, on, price, and, money, were, laid, out, in, a, letter, to, a, member, of, parliament, in, 1691, entitled, some, considerations, on, the, consequences, of, the, lowering, of, interest, and, the, raising, of, the, value, of, money, 1691, arguing, that, the, price, of, any, commodity, rises, or, falls, by, the, proportion, of, the, number, of, buyers, and, sellers, a, rule, which, holds, universally, in, all, things, that, are, to, be, bought, and, sold, dudley, north, 1641, 1691, was, a, wealthy, merchant, and, landowner, who, worked, for, her, majesty, s, treasury, and, opposed, most, mercantile, policy, his, discourses, upon, trade, 1691, published, anonymously, argued, against, assuming, a, need, for, a, favorable, balance, of, trade, trade, he, argued, benefits, both, sides, promotes, specialization, division, of, labor, and, wealth, for, everyone, regulation, of, trade, interferes, with, these, benefits, he, said, david, hume, 1711, 1776, agreed, with, north, s, philosophy, and, denounced, mercantilist, assumptions, his, contributions, were, set, down, in, political, discourses, 1752, and, later, consolidated, in, his, essays, moral, political, literary, 1777, adding, to, the, argument, that, it, was, undesirable, to, strive, for, a, favourable, balance, of, trade, hume, argued, that, it, is, in, any, case, impossible, hume, held, that, any, surplus, of, exports, would, be, paid, for, by, imports, of, gold, and, silver, this, would, increase, the, money, supply, causing, prices, to, rise, that, in, turn, would, cause, a, decline, in, exports, until, the, balance, with, imports, is, restored, bernard, mandeville, 1670, 1733, was, an, anglo, dutch, philosopher, political, economist, and, satirist, his, main, thesis, is, that, the, actions, of, men, cannot, be, divided, into, lower, and, higher, the, higher, life, of, man, is, a, mere, fiction, introduced, by, philosophers, and, rulers, to, simplify, government, and, the, relations, of, society, in, fact, virtue, which, he, defined, as, every, performance, by, which, man, contrary, to, the, impulse, of, nature, should, endeavour, the, benefit, of, others, or, the, conquest, of, his, own, passions, out, of, a, rational, ambition, of, being, good, is, actually, detrimental, to, the, state, in, its, commercial, and, intellectual, progress, this, is, because, it, is, the, vices, i, e, the, self, regarding, actions, of, men, which, alone, by, means, of, inventions, and, the, circulation, of, capital, economics, in, connection, with, luxurious, living, stimulate, society, into, action, and, progress, francis, hutcheson, 1694, 1746, the, teacher, of, adam, smith, from, 1737, to, 1740, is, considered, the, end, of, a, long, tradition, of, thought, on, economics, as, household, or, family, management, stemming, from, xenophon, s, work, oeconomicus, similarly, disenchanted, with, regulation, on, trade, inspired, by, mercantilism, the, frenchman, vincent, de, gournay, 1712, 1759, reputedly, asked, why, it, was, so, hard, to, laissez, faire, let, it, be, laissez, passer, let, it, pass, advocating, free, enterprise, and, free, trade, he, was, one, of, the, early, physiocrats, who, regarded, agriculture, as, the, source, of, wealth, as, historian, david, b, danbom, wrote, the, physiocrats, damned, cities, for, their, artificiality, and, praised, more, natural, styles, of, living, they, celebrated, farmers, over, the, end, of, the, seventeenth, and, beginning, of, the, eighteenth, century, major, advances, in, natural, science, and, anatomy, included, the, discovery, of, blood, circulation, through, the, human, body, documented, by, william, harvey, in, 1628, this, concept, was, mirrored, in, the, physiocrats, economic, theory, with, the, notion, of, a, circular, flow, of, income, throughout, an, economy, fran, ois, quesnay, 1694, 1774, served, as, the, court, physician, to, king, louis, xv, of, france, he, believed, that, trade, and, industry, were, not, sources, of, wealth, and, instead, in, his, book, tableau, conomique, 1758, economic, table, argued, that, agricultural, surpluses, by, flowing, through, the, economy, in, the, form, of, rent, wages, and, purchases, were, the, real, economic, movers, firstly, wrote, quesnay, regulation, impedes, the, flow, of, income, throughout, all, social, classes, and, therefore, economic, development, secondly, taxes, on, the, productive, classes, such, as, farmers, should, be, reduced, in, favour, of, rises, for, unproductive, classes, such, as, landowners, since, their, luxurious, way, of, life, distorts, the, income, flow, later, in, the, early, 19th, century, david, ricardo, showed, that, taxes, on, land, are, non, transferable, to, tenants, according, to, his, law, of, rent, jacques, turgot, 1727, 1781, was, born, in, paris, to, an, old, norman, family, his, best, known, work, r, flexions, sur, la, formation, et, la, distribution, des, richesses, reflections, on, the, formation, and, distribution, of, wealth, 1766, developed, quesnay, s, theory, that, land, is, the, only, source, of, wealth, turgot, viewed, society, in, terms, of, three, classes, the, productive, agricultural, class, the, salaried, artisan, class, classe, stipendice, and, the, landowning, class, classe, disponible, he, argued, that, only, the, net, product, of, land, should, be, taxed, and, advocated, complete, freedom, of, commerce, and, industry, in, august, 1774, king, louis, xvi, appointed, turgot, as, minister, of, finance, and, in, the, space, of, two, years, he, introduced, many, anti, mercantile, and, anti, feudal, measures, supported, by, the, king, his, guiding, principles, as, given, to, the, king, were, no, bankruptcy, no, tax, increases, no, borrowing, turgot, s, ultimate, wish, was, to, have, a, single, tax, on, land, and, to, abolish, all, other, indirect, taxes, but, measures, he, introduced, before, that, met, with, overwhelming, opposition, from, landed, interests, two, edicts, in, particular, one, suppressing, corv, es, forced, labour, obligations, due, by, peasants, to, landlords, and, another, renouncing, privileges, given, to, guilds, inflamed, influential, opinion, he, was, forced, from, office, in, 1776, in, 1751, neapolitan, philosopher, ferdinando, galiani, published, a, nearly, exhaustive, treatise, on, money, called, della, moneta, on, money, 25, years, before, adam, smith, s, the, wealth, of, nations, and, therefore, is, seen, as, possibly, the, first, truly, modern, economic, analysis, in, its, five, sections, della, moneta, covered, all, modern, aspects, of, monetary, theory, including, the, value, and, origin, of, money, its, regulation, and, inflation, this, text, remained, cited, by, various, economists, for, centuries, as, wide, ranging, a, list, as, karl, marx, and, austrian, economist, joseph, schumpeter, adam, smith, 1723, 1790, is, popularly, seen, as, the, father, of, modern, political, economy, his, 1776, publication, an, inquiry, into, the, nature, and, causes, of, the, wealth, of, nations, happened, to, coincide, not, only, with, the, american, revolution, shortly, before, the, europe, wide, upheavals, of, the, french, revolution, but, also, the, dawn, of, a, new, industrial, revolution, that, allowed, more, wealth, to, be, created, on, a, larger, scale, than, ever, before, smith, was, a, scottish, moral, philosopher, whose, first, book, was, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, 1759, he, argued, in, it, that, people, s, ethical, systems, develop, through, personal, relations, with, other, individuals, that, right, and, wrong, are, sensed, through, others, reactions, to, one, s, behaviour, this, gained, smith, more, popularity, than, his, next, work, the, wealth, of, nations, which, the, general, public, initially, ignored, yet, smith, s, political, economic, magnum, opus, was, successful, in, circles, that, mattered, smith, argued, for, a, system, of, natural, liberty, where, individual, effort, was, the, producer, of, social, good, smith, believed, even, the, selfish, within, society, were, kept, under, restraint, and, worked, for, the, good, of, all, when, acting, in, a, competitive, market, prices, are, often, unrepresentative, of, the, true, value, of, goods, and, services, following, john, locke, smith, thought, true, value, of, things, derived, from, the, amount, of, labour, invested, in, them, every, man, is, rich, or, poor, according, to, the, degree, in, which, he, can, afford, to, enjoy, the, necessaries, conveniencies, and, amusements, of, human, life, but, after, the, division, of, labour, has, once, thoroughly, taken, place, it, is, but, a, very, small, part, of, these, with, which, a, man, s, own, labour, can, supply, him, the, far, greater, part, of, them, he, must, derive, from, the, labour, of, other, people, and, he, must, be, rich, or, poor, according, to, the, quantity, of, that, labour, which, he, can, command, or, which, he, can, afford, to, purchase, the, value, of, any, commodity, therefore, to, the, person, who, possesses, it, and, who, means, not, to, use, or, consume, it, himself, but, to, exchange, it, for, other, commodities, is, equal, to, the, quantity, of, labour, which, it, enables, him, to, purchase, or, command, labour, therefore, is, the, real, measure, of, the, exchangeable, value, of, all, commodities, the, real, price, of, every, thing, what, every, thing, really, costs, to, the, man, who, wants, to, acquire, it, is, the, toil, and, trouble, of, acquiring, it, when, the, butchers, the, brewers, and, the, bakers, acted, under, the, restraint, of, an, open, market, economy, their, pursuit, of, self, interest, thought, smith, paradoxically, drives, the, process, to, correct, real, life, prices, to, their, just, values, his, classic, statement, on, competition, goes, as, follows, when, the, quantity, of, any, commodity, which, is, brought, to, market, falls, short, of, the, effectual, demand, all, those, who, are, willing, to, pay, cannot, be, supplied, with, the, quantity, which, they, want, some, of, them, will, be, willing, to, give, more, a, competition, will, begin, among, them, and, the, market, price, will, rise, when, the, quantity, brought, to, market, exceeds, the, effectual, demand, it, cannot, be, all, sold, to, those, who, are, willing, to, pay, the, whole, value, of, the, rent, wages, and, profit, which, must, be, paid, to, bring, it, thither, the, market, price, will, sink, smith, s, vision, of, a, free, market, economy, based, on, secure, property, capital, accumulation, widening, markets, and, a, division, of, labour, contrasted, with, the, mercantilist, tendency, to, attempt, to, regulate, all, evil, human, actions, smith, believed, there, were, precisely, three, legitimate, functions, of, government, the, third, function, was, erecting, and, maintaining, certain, public, works, and, certain, public, institutions, which, it, can, never, be, for, the, interest, of, any, individual, or, small, number, of, individuals, to, erect, and, maintain, every, system, which, endeavours, to, draw, towards, a, particular, species, of, industry, a, greater, share, of, the, capital, of, the, society, than, what, would, naturally, go, to, it, retards, instead, of, accelerating, the, progress, of, the, society, toward, real, wealth, and, greatness, in, addition, to, the, necessity, of, public, leadership, in, certain, sectors, smith, argued, secondly, that, cartels, were, undesirable, because, of, their, potential, to, limit, production, and, quality, of, goods, and, services, thirdly, smith, criticised, government, support, of, any, kind, of, monopoly, which, always, charges, the, highest, price, which, can, be, squeezed, out, of, the, buyers, the, existence, of, monopoly, and, the, potential, for, cartels, which, would, later, form, the, core, of, competition, law, policy, could, distort, the, benefits, of, free, markets, to, the, advantage, of, businesses, at, the, expense, of, consumer, sovereignty, william, pitt, the, younger, 1759, 1806, tory, prime, minister, in, 1783, 1801, based, his, tax, proposals, on, smith, s, ideas, and, advocated, free, trade, as, a, devout, disciple, of, the, wealth, of, nations, smith, was, appointed, a, commissioner, of, customs, and, within, twenty, years, smith, had, a, following, of, new, generation, writers, who, were, intent, on, building, the, science, of, political, economy, adam, smith, expressed, an, affinity, to, the, opinions, of, irish, mp, edmund, burke, 1729, 1797, known, widely, as, a, political, philosopher, burke, is, the, only, man, i, ever, knew, who, thinks, on, economic, subjects, exactly, as, i, do, without, any, previous, communication, having, passed, between, us, burke, was, an, established, political, economist, himself, known, for, his, book, thoughts, and, details, on, scarcity, he, was, widely, critical, of, liberal, politics, and, condemned, the, french, revolution, which, began, in, 1789, in, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, 1790, he, wrote, that, the, age, of, chivalry, is, dead, that, of, sophisters, economists, and, calculators, has, succeeded, and, the, glory, of, europe, is, extinguished, forever, smith, s, contemporary, influences, included, fran, ois, quesnay, and, jacques, turgot, whom, he, met, on, a, visit, to, paris, and, david, hume, his, scottish, compatriot, the, times, produced, a, common, need, among, thinkers, to, explain, social, upheavals, of, the, industrial, revolution, taking, place, and, in, the, seeming, chaos, without, the, feudal, and, monarchical, structures, of, europe, show, there, was, order, still, jeremy, bentham, 1748, 1832, was, perhaps, the, most, radical, thinker, of, his, time, and, developed, the, concept, of, utilitarianism, bentham, was, an, atheist, a, prison, reformer, animal, rights, activist, believer, in, universal, suffrage, freedom, of, speech, free, trade, and, health, insurance, at, a, time, when, few, dared, to, argue, for, any, of, these, ideas, he, was, schooled, rigorously, from, an, early, age, finishing, university, and, being, called, to, the, bar, at, 18, his, first, book, a, fragment, on, government, 1776, published, anonymously, was, a, trenchant, critique, of, william, blackstone, s, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, this, gained, wide, success, until, it, was, found, that, the, young, bentham, and, not, a, revered, professor, had, penned, it, in, an, introduction, to, the, principles, of, morals, and, legislation, 1789, bentham, set, out, his, theory, of, utility, jean, baptiste, say, 1767, 1832, was, a, frenchman, born, in, lyon, who, helped, popularize, adam, smith, s, work, in, france, his, book, a, treatise, on, political, economy, 1803, contained, a, brief, passage, which, later, became, orthodoxy, in, political, economics, until, the, great, depression, now, known, as, say, s, law, of, markets, say, argued, that, there, could, never, be, a, general, deficiency, of, demand, or, a, general, glut, of, commodities, in, the, whole, economy, people, produce, things, to, fulfill, their, own, wants, rather, than, those, of, others, therefore, production, is, not, a, question, of, supply, but, an, indication, of, producers, demanding, goods, say, agreed, that, a, part, of, income, is, saved, by, households, but, in, the, long, term, savings, are, invested, investment, and, consumption, are, the, two, elements, of, demand, so, that, production, is, demand, therefore, it, is, impossible, for, production, to, outrun, demand, or, for, there, to, be, a, general, glut, of, supply, say, also, argued, that, money, was, neutral, because, its, sole, role, is, to, facilitate, exchanges, therefore, people, demand, money, only, to, buy, commodities, money, is, a, veil, david, ricardo, 1772, 1823, was, born, in, london, by, the, age, of, 26, he, had, become, a, wealthy, stock, market, trader, and, bought, himself, a, constituency, seat, in, ireland, to, gain, a, platform, in, the, british, parliament, s, house, of, commons, ricardo, s, best, known, work, is, on, the, principles, of, political, economy, and, taxation, 1817, which, contains, his, critique, of, barriers, to, international, trade, and, a, description, of, the, manner, in, which, income, is, distributed, in, the, population, ricardo, made, a, distinction, between, workers, who, received, a, wage, fixed, to, a, level, at, which, they, could, survive, the, landowners, who, earn, a, rent, and, capitalists, who, own, capital, and, receive, a, profit, a, residual, part, of, the, income, if, population, grows, it, becomes, necessary, to, cultivate, additional, land, whose, fertility, is, lower, than, that, of, already, cultivated, fields, because, of, the, law, of, decreasing, productivity, therefore, the, cost, of, the, production, of, the, wheat, increases, as, well, as, the, price, of, the, wheat, the, rents, increase, also, the, wages, indexed, to, inflation, because, they, must, allow, workers, to, survive, as, well, profits, decrease, until, the, capitalists, can, no, longer, invest, the, economy, ricardo, concluded, is, bound, to, tend, towards, a, steady, state, jean, charles, l, onard, de, sismondi, 1773, 1842, was, the, earliest, author, of, systemic, crisis, theory, john, stuart, mill, 1806, 1873, was, the, dominant, figure, of, political, economic, thought, of, his, time, as, well, as, a, member, of, parliament, for, the, seat, of, westminster, and, a, leading, political, philosopher, mill, was, a, child, prodigy, reading, ancient, greek, from, the, age, of, 3, and, being, vigorously, schooled, by, his, father, james, mill, jeremy, bentham, was, a, close, mentor, and, family, friend, and, mill, was, heavily, influenced, by, david, ricardo, mill, s, textbook, first, published, in, 1848, and, titled, principles, of, political, economy, was, essentially, a, summary, of, the, economic, thought, of, the, mid, nineteenth, century, principles, of, political, economy, 1848, was, used, as, the, standard, text, by, most, universities, well, into, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, on, the, question, of, economic, growth, mill, tried, to, find, a, middle, ground, between, adam, smith, s, view, of, ever, expanding, opportunities, for, trade, and, technological, innovation, and, thomas, malthus, view, of, the, inherent, limits, of, population, in, his, fourth, book, mill, set, out, a, number, of, possible, future, outcomes, rather, than, predicting, one, in, particular, the, classical, economists, were, referred, to, as, a, group, for, the, first, time, by, karl, marx, one, unifying, part, of, their, theories, was, the, labour, theory, of, value, contrasting, to, value, deriving, from, a, general, equilibrium, theory, of, supply, and, demand, these, economists, had, seen, the, first, economic, and, social, transformation, brought, by, the, industrial, revolution, rural, depopulation, precariousness, poverty, apparition, of, a, working, class, they, wondered, about, population, growth, because, demographic, transition, had, begun, in, great, britain, at, that, time, they, also, asked, many, fundamental, questions, about, the, source, of, value, the, causes, of, economic, growth, and, the, role, of, money, in, the, economy, they, supported, a, free, market, economy, arguing, it, was, a, natural, system, based, upon, freedom, and, property, however, these, economists, were, divided, and, did, not, make, up, a, unified, current, of, thought, a, notable, current, within, classical, economics, was, underconsumption, theory, as, advanced, by, the, birmingham, school, and, thomas, robert, malthus, in, the, early, 19th, century, these, argued, for, government, action, to, mitigate, unemployment, and, economic, downturns, and, were, an, intellectual, predecessor, of, what, later, became, keynesian, economics, in, the, 1930s, another, notable, school, was, manchester, capitalism, which, advocated, free, trade, against, the, previous, policy, of, mercantilism, marx, wrote, his, magnum, opus, das, kapital, capital, a, critique, of, political, economy, 1867, at, the, british, museum, s, library, in, london, karl, marx, begins, with, the, concept, of, commodities, which, he, views, as, a, historically, specific, phenomenon, he, hence, looks, to, history, to, state, that, before, capital, production, was, based, on, slavery, in, ancient, rome, for, example, then, serfdom, in, the, feudal, societies, of, medieval, europe, marx, viewed, the, current, mode, of, production, as, one, which, would, ultimately, produce, an, erratic, and, unstable, situation, allowing, the, conditions, for, revolution, in, the, long, term, marx, uses, the, word, commodity, in, an, extensive, metaphysical, discussion, of, the, nature, of, material, wealth, how, the, objects, of, wealth, are, perceived, and, how, they, can, be, used, a, commodity, contrasts, to, objects, of, the, natural, world, when, people, mix, their, labor, with, an, object, it, becomes, a, commodity, in, the, natural, world, there, are, trees, diamonds, iron, ore, and, people, in, the, world, of, the, economists, they, become, chairs, rings, factories, and, workers, however, says, marx, commodities, have, a, dual, nature, he, distinguishes, the, use, value, of, a, thing, from, its, exchange, value, if, commodities, are, considered, absolutely, isolated, from, their, useful, qualities, the, common, property, is, human, labor, in, the, abstract, a, phenomenon, unique, to, a, specific, historical, configuration, which, is, dependent, on, certain, social, practices, most, dominantly, waged, work, executed, en, masse, marx, argued, for, critique, by, linking, his, ideas, of, surplus, value, and, socially, necessary, labor, time, with, the, classical, labor, theory, of, value, and, theories, of, rent, marx, believed, that, a, reserve, army, of, the, unemployed, would, grow, and, grow, fueling, a, downward, pressure, on, wages, as, desperate, people, accepted, work, for, less, but, this, would, produce, a, deficit, of, demand, as, the, people, s, power, to, purchase, products, lagged, a, glut, of, unsold, products, would, result, production, would, be, cut, back, and, profits, decline, until, capital, accumulation, halted, in, an, economic, depression, when, the, glut, cleared, the, economy, would, again, start, to, boom, before, the, next, cyclical, bust, begins, with, every, boom, and, bust, with, every, capitalist, crisis, thought, marx, tension, and, conflict, between, the, increasingly, polarized, classes, of, capitalists, and, workers, would, heighten, due, to, the, tendency, of, the, rate, of, profit, to, fall, henry, george, 1839, 1897, is, popularly, recognized, as, the, intellectual, inspiration, for, the, economic, philosophy, now, known, as, georgism, george, is, said, to, be, the, last, classical, economist, during, his, life, george, was, one, of, the, three, most, famous, americans, along, with, henry, ford, and, thomas, edison, george, s, first, book, progress, and, poverty, was, one, of, the, most, widely, printed, books, in, english, selling, between, 3, and, 6, million, copies, by, the, early, 1900s, progress, and, poverty, sparked, a, worldwide, reform, movement, and, is, sometimes, marked, as, the, beginning, of, the, progressive, era, georgism, declined, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, as, the, marxist, and, austrian, and, keynesian, neoclassical, schools, gained, popularity, however, there, are, still, active, georgist, organizations, and, land, reform, movements, around, the, world, george, s, ideas, have, been, incorporated, into, the, philosophies, of, socialism, libertarianism, and, ecological, economics, paul, samuelson, listed, henry, george, as, one, of, only, six, american, saints, in, classical, economics, in, 1895, the, london, school, of, economics, lse, was, founded, by, fabian, society, members, sidney, webb, 1859, 1947, beatrice, webb, 1858, 1943, and, george, bernard, shaw, 1856, 1950, joining, the, university, of, london, in, 1900, in, the, 1930s, lse, member, sir, roy, g, d, allen, 1906, 1983, popularized, the, use, of, mathematics, in, economics, neoclassical, economics, developed, in, the, 1870s, there, were, three, main, independent, schools, the, cambridge, school, was, founded, with, the, 1871, publication, of, jevons, theory, of, political, economy, developing, theories, of, partial, equilibrium, and, focusing, on, market, failures, its, main, representatives, were, stanley, jevons, alfred, marshall, and, arthur, pigou, the, austrian, school, of, economics, was, made, up, of, austrian, economists, carl, menger, eugen, von, b, hm, bawerk, and, friedrich, von, wieser, who, developed, the, theory, of, capital, and, tried, to, explain, economic,

large, influence, on, the, economic, thinking, of, austrian, school, economist, friedrich, hayek, 1899, 1992, who, while, initially, sympathetic, became, one, of, the, leading, academic, critics, of, collectivism, in, the, 20th, century, hayek, believed, that, all, forms, of, collectivism, even, those, theoretically, based, on, voluntary, cooperation, could, only, be, maintained, by, a, central, authority, but, he, argued, that, centralizing, economic, decision, making, would, lead, not, only, to, infringements, of, liberty, but, also, to, depressed, standards, of, living, because, centralized, experts, could, not, gather, and, assess, the, knowledge, required, to, allocate, scarce, resources, efficiently, or, productively, in, his, book, the, road, to, serfdom, 1944, and, in, subsequent, works, hayek, claimed, that, socialism, required, central, economic, planning, and, that, such, planning, in, turn, would, lead, towards, totalitarianism, hayek, attributed, the, birth, of, civilization, to, private, property, in, his, book, the, fatal, conceit, 1988, according, to, him, price, signals, are, the, only, means, of, enabling, each, economic, decision, maker, to,

materialistic, culture, and, wealthy, people, who, conspicuously, consumed, their, riches, as, a, way, of, demonstrating, success, in, the, theory, of, business, enterprise, 1904, veblen, distinguished, production, for, people, to, use, things, and, production, for, pure, profit, arguing, that, the, former, is, often, hindered, because, businesses, pursue, the, latter, output, and,

of, significant, upheaval, in, the, world, economy, one, of, the, most, original, contributions, to, understanding, what, went, wrong, came, from, harvard, university, lawyer, adolf, berle, 1895, 1971, who, like, john, maynard, keynes, had, resigned, from, his, diplomatic, job, at, the, paris, peace, conference, 1919, and, was, deeply, disillusioned, by, the, versailles, treaty, in, his, book, with, american, economist, gardiner, c, means, 1896, 1988, the, modern, corporation, and, private, property, 1932, he, detailed, the, evolution, in, the, contemporary, economy, of, big, business, and, argued, that, those, who, controlled, big, firms, should, be, better, held, to, account, directors, of, companies, are, held, to, account, to, the, shareholders, of, companies, or, not, by, the, rules, found, in, company, law, statutes, this, might, include, rights, to, elect, and, fire, the, management, require, for, regular, general, meetings, accounting, standards, and, so, on, in, 1930s, america, the, typical, company, laws, e, g, in, delaware, did, not, clearly, mandate, such, rights, berle, argued, that, the, unaccountable, directors, of, companies, were, therefore, apt, to, funnel, the, fruits, of, enterprise, profits, into, their, own, pockets, as, well, as, manage, in, their, own, interests, the, ability, to, do, this, was, supported, by, the, fact, that, the, majority, of, shareholders, in, big, public, companies, were, single, individuals, with, scant, means, of, communication, in, short, divided, and, conquered, berle, served, in, president, franklin, delano, roosevelt, s, administration, through, the, great, depression, as, a, key, member, of, his, brain, trust, developing, many, new, deal, policies, in, 1967, berle, and, means, issued, a, revised, edition, of, their, work, in, which, the, preface, added, a, new, dimension, it, was, not, only, the, separation, of, controllers, of, companies, from, the, owners, as, shareholders, at, stake, they, posed, the, question, of, what, the, corporate, structure, was, really, meant, to, achieve, stockholders, toil, not, neither, do, they, spin, to, earn, they, are, beneficiaries, by, position, only, justification, for, their, inheritance, can, be, founded, only, upon, social, grounds, that, justification, turns, on, the, distribution, as, well, as, the, existence, of, wealth, its, force, exists, only, in, direct, ratio, to, the, number, of, individuals, who, hold, such, wealth, justification, for, the, stockholder, s, existence, thus, depends, on, increasing, distribution, within, the, american, population, ideally, the, stockholder, s, position, will, be, impregnable, only, when, every, american, family, has, its, fragment, of, that, position, and, of, the, wealth, by, which, the,

population, was, perceived, as, a, simple, path, of, progress, however, in, the, 1930s, economists, began, developing, models, of, non, renewable, resource, management, see, hotelling, s, rule, and, the, sustainability, of, welfare, in, an, economy, that, uses, non, renewable, resources, concerns, about, the, environmental, and, social, impacts, of, industry, had, been, expressed, by, some,

the, state, must, interfere, to, prevent, them, however, pigou, retained, free, market, beliefs, and, in, 1933, in, the, face, of, the, economic, crisis, he, explained, in, the, theory, of, unemployment, that, the, excessive, intervention, of, the, state, in, the, labor, market, was, the, real, cause, of, massive, unemployment, because, the, governments, had, established, a, minimal, wage, which, prevented, wages, from, adjusting, automatically, this, was, to, be, the, focus, of, attack, from, keynes, in, 1943, pigou, published, the, paper, the, classical, stationary, state,

held, in, july, 1944, to, establish, a, new, economic, order, in, which, keynes, was, again, to, play, a, leading, role, during, the, great, depression, keynes, published, his, most, important, work, the, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, 1936, the, great, depression, had, been, sparked, by, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, leading, to, massive, rises, in, unemployment, in, the, united, states, leading, to, debts, being, recalled, from, european, borrowers, and, an, economic, domino, effect, across, the, world, orthodox, economics, called, for, a, tightening, of, spending, until, business, confidence, and, profit, levels, could, be, restored, keynes, by, contrast, had, argued, in, a, tract, on, monetary, reform, 1923, which, argues, for, a, stable, currency, that, a, variety, of, factors, determined, economic, activity, and, that, it, was, not, enough, to, wait, for, the, long, run, market, equilibrium, to, restore, itself, as, keynes, famously, remarked, this, long, run, is, a, misleading, guide, to, current, affairs, in, the, long, run, we, are, all, dead, economists, set, themselves, too, easy, too, useless, a, task, if, in, tempestuous, seasons, they, can, only, tell, us, that, when, the, storm, is, long, past, the, ocean, is, flat, again, on, top, of, the, supply, of, money, keynes, identified, the, propensity, to, consume, inducement, to, invest, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, liquidity, preference, and, multiplier, effect, as, variables, which, determine, the, level, of, the, economy, s, output, employment, and, price, levels, much, of, this, esoteric, terminology, was, invented, by, keynes, especially, for, his, general, theory, keynes, argued, that, if, savings, were, being, withheld, from, investment, in, financial, markets, total, spending, falls, leading, to, reduced, incomes, and, unemployment, which, reduces, savings, again, this, continues, until, the, desire, to, save, becomes, equal, to, the, desire, to, invest, which, means, a, new, equilibrium, is, reached, and, the, spending, decline, halts, this, new, equilibrium, is, a, depression, where, people, are, investing, less, have, less, to, save, and, less, to, spend, keynes, argued, that, employment, depends, on, total, spending, which, is, composed, of, consumer, spending, and, business, investment, in, the, private, sector, consumers, only, spend, passively, or, according, to, their, income, fluctuations, businesses, on, the, other, hand, are, induced, to, invest, by, the, expected, rate, of, return, on, new, investments, the, benefit, and, the, rate, of, interest, paid, the, cost, so, said, keynes, if, business, expectations, remained, the, same, and, government, reduces, interest, rates, the, costs, of, borrowing, investment, would, increase, and, would, have, a, multiplied, effect, on, total, spending, interest, rates, in, turn, depend, on, the, quantity, of, money, and, the, desire, to, hold, money, in, bank, accounts, as, opposed, to, investing, if, not, enough, money, is, available, to, match, how, much, people, want, to, hold, interest, rates, rise, until, enough, people, are, put, off, so, if, the, quantity, of, money, were, increased, while, the, desire, to, hold, money, remained, stable, interest, rates, would, fall, leading, to, increased, investment, output, and, employment, for, both, these, reasons, keynes, therefore, advocated, low, interest, rates, and, easy, credit, to, combat, unemployment, but, keynes, believed, in, the, 1930s, conditions, necessitated, public, sector, action, deficit, spending, said, keynes, would, kick, start, economic, activity, this, he, had, advocated, in, an, open, letter, to, u, s, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, in, the, new, york, times, 1933, the, new, deal, programme, in, the, u, s, had, been, well, underway, by, the, publication, of, the, general, theory, it, provided, conceptual, reinforcement, for, policies, already, pursued, keynes, also, believed, in, a, more, egalitarian, distribution, of, income, and, taxation, on, unearned, income, arguing, that, high, rates, of, savings, to, which, richer, folk, are, prone, are, not, desirable, in, a, developed, economy, keynes, therefore, advocated, both, monetary, management, and, an, active, fiscal, policy, during, world, war, ii, keynes, acted, as, adviser, to, hm, treasury, again, negotiating, major, loans, from, the, u, s, helping, formulate, the, plans, for, the, international, monetary, fund, the, world, bank, and, the, international, trade, organisation, at, the, 1944, bretton, woods, conference, a, package, designed, to, stabilize, world, economy, fluctuations, that, had, occurred, in, the, 1920s, and, create, a, level, trading, field, across, the, globe, keynes, died, little, more, than, a, year, later, but, his, ideas, had, already, shaped, a, new, global, economic, order, and, all, western, governments, followed, the, keynesian, economics, program, of, deficit, spending, to, avert, crises, and, maintain, full, employment, one, of, keynes, s, pupils, at, cambridge, was, joan, robinson, 1903, 1983, a, member, of, keynes, s, cambridge, circus, who, contributed, to, the, notion, that, competition, is, seldom, perfect, in, a, market, an, indictment, of, the, theory, of, markets, setting, prices, in, the, production, function, and, the, theory, of, capital, 1953, robinson, tackled, what, she, saw, to, be, some, of, the, circularity, in, orthodox, economics, neoclassicists, assert, that, a, competitive, market, forces, producers, to, minimize, the, costs, of, production, robinson, said, that, costs, of, production, are, merely, the, prices, of, inputs, like, capital, capital, goods, get, their, value, from, the, final, products, and, if, the, price, of, the, final, products, determines, the, price, of, capital, then, it, is, argued, robinson, utterly, circular, to, say, that, the, price, of, capital, determines, the, price, of, the, final, products, goods, cannot, be, priced, until, the, costs, of, inputs, are, determined, this, would, not, matter, if, everything, in, the, economy, happened, instantaneously, but, in, the, real, world, price, setting, takes, time, goods, are, priced, before, they, are, sold, since, capital, cannot, be, adequately, valued, in, independently, measurable, units, how, can, one, show, that, capital, earns, a, return, equal, to, the, contribution, to, production, alfred, eichner, 1937, 1988, was, an, american, post, keynesian, economist, who, challenged, the, neoclassical, price, mechanism, and, asserted, that, prices, are, not, set, through, supply, and, demand, but, rather, through, mark, up, pricing, eichner, is, one, of, the, founders, of, the, post, keynesian, school, of, economics, and, was, a, professor, at, rutgers, university, at, the, time, of, his, death, eichner, s, writings, and, advocacy, of, thought, differed, with, the, theories, of, john, maynard, keynes, who, was, an, advocate, of, government, intervention, in, the, free, market, and, proponent, of, public, spending, to, increase, employment, eichner, argued, that, investment, was, the, key, to, economic, expansion, he, was, considered, an, advocate, of, the, concept, that, government, incomes, policy, should, prevent, inflationary, wage, and, price, settlements, in, connection, to, the, customary, fiscal, and, monetary, means, of, regulating, the, economy, richard, kahn, 1905, 1989, was, a, member, of, the, cambridge, circus, who, in, 1931, proposed, the, multiplier, piero, sraffa, 1898, 1983, came, to, england, from, fascist, italy, in, the, 1920s, and, became, a, member, of, the, cambridge, circus, in, 1960, he, published, a, small, book, called, production, of, commodities, by, means, of, commodities, which, explained, how, technological, relationships, are, the, basis, for, production, of, goods, and, services, prices, result, from, wage, profit, tradeoffs, collective, bargaining, labour, and, management, conflict, and, the, intervention, of, government, planning, like, robinson, sraffa, was, showing, how, the, major, force, for, price, setting, in, the, economy, was, not, necessarily, market, adjustments, john, hicks, 1904, 1989, of, england, was, a, keynesian, who, in, 1937, proposed, the, investment, saving, liquidity, preference, money, supply, model, which, treats, the, intersection, of, the, is, and, lm, curves, as, the, general, equilibrium, in, both, markets, in, 1977, edmund, phelps, 1933, who, was, awarded, the, 2006, nobel, economics, prize, and, john, b, taylor, 1946, published, a, paper, proving, that, staggered, setting, of, wages, and, prices, gives, monetary, policy, a, role, in, stabilizing, economic, fluctuations, if, the, wages, prices, are, sticky, even, when, all, workers, and, firms, have, rational, expectations, which, caused, keynesian, economics, to, make, a, comeback, among, mainstream, economists, with, new, keynesian, macroeconomics, its, central, theme, is, the, provision, of, a, microeconomic, foundation, for, keynesian, macroeconomics, obtained, by, identifying, minimal, deviations, from, the, standard, microeconomic, assumptions, which, yield, keynesian, macroeconomic, conclusions, such, as, the, possibility, of, significant, welfare, benefits, from, macroeconomic, stabilization, in, 1985, george, akerlof, 1940, and, janet, yellen, 1946, published, menu, costs, arguments, showing, that, under, imperfect, competition, small, deviations, from, rationality, generate, significant, in, welfare, terms, price, stickiness, in, 1987, british, economist, huw, dixon, 1958, published, a, simple, model, of, imperfect, competition, with, walrasian, features, the, first, work, to, demonstrate, in, a, simple, general, equilibrium, model, that, the, fiscal, multiplier, could, be, increasing, with, the, degree, of, imperfect, competition, in, the, output, market, helping, develop, new, keynesian, economics, the, reason, for, this, is, that, imperfect, competition, in, the, output, market, tends, to, reduce, the, real, wage, leading, to, the, household, substituting, away, from, consumption, towards, leisure, when, government, spending, is, increased, the, corresponding, increase, in, lump, sum, taxation, causes, both, leisure, and, consumption, to, decrease, assuming, that, they, are, both, a, normal, good, the, greater, the, degree, of, imperfect, competition, in, the, output, market, the, lower, the, real, wage, and, hence, the, more, the, reduction, falls, on, leisure, i, e, households, work, more, and, less, on, consumption, hence, the, fiscal, multiplier, is, less, than, one, but, increasing, in, the, degree, of, imperfect, competition, in, the, output, market, in, 1997, american, economist, michael, woodford, 1955, and, argentine, economist, julio, rotemberg, 1953, published, the, first, paper, describing, a, microfounded, dsge, new, keynesian, macroeconomic, model, in, 1975, american, economists, sidney, weintraub, 1914, 1983, and, henry, wallich, 1914, 1988, published, a, tax, based, incomes, policy, promoting, tax, based, incomes, policy, tip, using, the, income, tax, mechanism, to, implement, an, anti, inflationary, incomes, policy, in, 1978, weintraub, and, american, economist, paul, davidson, 1930, founded, the, journal, of, post, keynesian, economics, this, opened, the, door, to, many, younger, economists, such, as, e, ray, canterbery, 1935, always, post, keynesian, in, his, style, and, approach, canterbery, went, on, to, make, contributions, outside, traditional, post, keynesianism, his, friend, john, kenneth, galbraith, was, a, long, time, influence, in, 1913, english, economist, diplomat, alfred, mitchell, innes, 1864, 1950, published, what, is, money, which, was, reviewed, favorably, by, john, maynard, keynes, followed, in, 1914, by, the, credit, theory, of, money, advocating, the, credit, theory, of, money, which, economist, l, randall, wray, called, the, best, pair, of, articles, on, the, nature, of, money, written, in, the, twentieth, century, the, government, interventionist, monetary, and, fiscal, policies, that, the, postwar, keynesian, economists, recommended, came, under, attack, by, a, group, of, theorists, working, at, the, university, of, chicago, which, came, in, the, 1950s, to, be, known, as, the, chicago, school, of, economics, before, world, war, ii, the, old, chicago, school, of, strong, keynesians, was, founded, by, frank, knight, 1885, 1972, jacob, viner, 1892, 1970, and, henry, calvert, simons, 1899, 1946, the, second, generation, was, known, for, a, more, conservative, line, of, thought, reasserting, a, libertarian, view, of, market, activity, that, people, are, best, left, to, themselves, to, be, free, to, choose, how, to, conduct, their, own, affairs, ronald, coase, 1910, 2013, of, the, chicago, school, of, economics, was, the, most, prominent, economic, analyst, of, law, and, the, 1991, nobel, prize, in, economics, winner, his, first, major, article, the, nature, of, the, firm, 1937, argued, that, the, reason, for, the, existence, of, firms, companies, partnerships, etc, is, the, existence, of, transaction, costs, homo, economicus, trades, through, bilateral, contracts, on, open, markets, until, the, costs, of, transactions, make, the, use, of, corporations, to, produce, things, more, cost, effective, his, second, major, article, the, problem, of, social, cost, 1960, argued, that, if, we, lived, in, a, world, without, transaction, costs, people, would, bargain, with, one, another, to, create, the, same, allocation, of, resources, regardless, of, the, way, a, court, might, rule, in, property, disputes, coase, used, the, example, of, an, old, legal, case, about, nuisance, named, sturges, v, bridgman, where, a, noisy, sweets, maker, and, a, quiet, doctor, were, neighbors, and, went, to, court, to, see, who, should, have, to, move, coase, said, that, regardless, of, whether, the, judge, ruled, that, the, sweets, maker, had, to, stop, using, his, machinery, or, that, the, doctor, had, to, put, up, with, it, they, could, strike, a, mutually, beneficial, bargain, about, who, moves, house, that, reaches, the, same, outcome, of, resource, distribution, only, the, existence, of, transaction, costs, may, prevent, this, so, the, law, ought, to, preempt, what, would, happen, and, be, guided, by, the, most, efficient, solution, the, idea, is, that, law, and, regulation, are, not, as, important, or, effective, at, helping, people, as, lawyers, and, government, planners, believe, coase, and, others, like, him, wanted, a, change, of, approach, to, put, the, burden, of, proof, for, positive, effects, on, a, government, that, was, intervening, in, the, market, by, analyzing, the, costs, of, action, in, the, 1960s, gary, becker, 1930, 2014, and, jacob, mincer, 1922, 2006, of, the, chicago, school, of, economics, founded, new, home, economics, which, spawned, family, economics, in, 1973, coase, disciple, richard, posner, 1939, published, economic, analysis, of, law, which, became, a, standard, textbook, causing, him, to, become, the, most, cited, legal, scholar, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1981, he, published, the, economics, of, justice, which, claimed, that, judges, have, been, interpreting, common, law, as, it, they, were, trying, to, maximize, economic, welfare, milton, friedman, 1912, 2006, of, the, chicago, school, of, economics, is, one, of, the, most, influential, economists, of, the, late, 20th, century, receiving, the, nobel, prize, in, economics, in, 1976, he, is, known, for, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, 1963, in, which, he, argued, that, the, great, depression, was, caused, by, the, policies, of, the, federal, reserve, friedman, argues, that, laissez, faire, government, policy, is, more, desirable, than, government, intervention, in, the, economy, governments, should, aim, for, a, neutral, monetary, policy, oriented, toward, long, run, economic, growth, by, gradual, expansion, of, the, money, supply, he, advocates, the, quantity, theory, of, money, that, general, prices, are, determined, by, money, therefore, active, monetary, e, g, easy, credit, or, fiscal, e, g, tax, and, spend, policy, can, have, unintended, negative, effects, in, capitalism, and, freedom, 1962, friedman, wrote, there, is, likely, to, be, a, lag, between, the, need, for, action, and, government, recognition, of, the, need, a, further, lag, between, recognition, of, the, need, for, action, and, the, taking, of, action, and, a, still, further, lag, between, the, action, and, its, effects, friedman, was, also, known, for, his, work, on, the, consumption, function, the, permanent, income, hypothesis, 1957, which, friedman, referred, to, as, his, best, scientific, work, this, work, contended, that, rational, consumers, would, spend, a, proportional, amount, of, what, they, perceived, to, be, their, permanent, income, windfall, gains, would, mostly, be, saved, tax, reductions, likewise, as, rational, consumers, would, predict, that, taxes, would, have, to, rise, later, to, balance, public, finances, other, important, contributions, include, his, critique, of, the, phillips, curve, and, the, concept, of, the, natural, rate, of, unemployment, 1968, in, the, early, 1970s, american, chicago, school, economist, robert, e, lucas, jr, 1937, founded, new, classical, macroeconomics, based, on, milton, friedman, s, monetarist, critique, of, keynesian, macroeconomics, and, the, idea, of, rational, expectations, first, proposed, in, 1961, by, john, f, muth, opposing, the, idea, that, government, intervention, can, or, should, stabilize, the, economy, the, policy, ineffectiveness, proposition, 1975, of, thomas, j, sargent, 1943, and, neil, wallace, 1939, which, seemed, to, refute, a, basic, assumption, of, keynesian, economics, was, also, adopted, the, lucas, aggregate, supply, function, states, that, economic, output, is, a, function, of, money, or, price, surprise, lucas, was, awarded, the, 1995, nobel, economics, prize, lucas, model, was, superseded, as, the, standard, model, of, new, classical, macroeconomics, by, the, real, business, cycle, theory, proposed, in, 1982, by, finn, kydland, 1943, and, edward, c, prescott, 1940, which, seeks, to, explain, observed, fluctuations, in, output, and, employment, in, terms, of, real, variables, such, as, changes, in, technology, and, tastes, assuming, competitive, markets, real, business, cycle, theory, implies, that, cyclical, fluctuations, are, optimal, responses, to, variability, in, technology, and, tastes, and, that, macroeconomic, stabilization, policies, must, reduce, welfare, in, 1982, kydland, and, prescott, also, founded, the, theory, of, dynamic, stochastic, general, equilibrium, dsge, large, systems, of, microeconomic, equations, combined, into, models, of, the, general, economy, which, became, central, to, the, new, neoclassical, synthesis, incorporating, theoretical, elements, such, as, sticky, prices, from, new, keynesian, macroeconomics, they, shared, the, 2004, nobel, economics, prize, in, 1965, chicago, school, economist, eugene, fama, 1939, published, the, behavior, of, stock, market, prices, which, found, that, stock, market, prices, follow, a, random, walk, proposing, the, efficient, market, hypothesis, that, randomness, is, characteristic, of, a, perfectly, functioning, financial, market, the, same, year, paul, samuelson, published, a, paper, concluding, the, same, thing, with, a, mathematical, proof, sharing, the, credit, earlier, in, 1948, holbrook, working, 1895, 1985, published, a, paper, saying, the, same, thing, but, not, in, a, mathematical, form, in, 1970, fama, published, efficient, capital, markets, a, review, of, theory, and, empirical, work, proposing, that, efficient, markets, can, be, strong, semi, strong, or, weak, and, also, proposing, the, joint, hypothesis, problem, that, the, idea, of, market, efficiency, can, not, be, rejected, without, also, rejecting, the, market, mechanism, in, 1898, thorstein, veblen, published, why, is, economics, not, an, evolutionary, science, which, coins, the, term, evolutionary, economics, making, use, of, anthropology, to, deny, that, there, is, a, universal, human, nature, emphasizing, the, conflict, between, industrial, or, instrumental, and, pecuniary, or, ceremonial, values, which, became, known, as, the, ceremonial, instrumental, dichotomy, joseph, alois, schumpeter, 1883, 1950, was, an, austrian, school, economist, and, political, scientist, best, known, for, his, works, on, business, cycles, and, innovation, he, insisted, on, the, role, of, the, entrepreneurs, in, an, economy, in, business, cycles, a, theoretical, historical, and, statistical, analysis, of, the, capitalist, process, 1939, schumpeter, synthesized, the, theories, about, business, cycles, suggesting, that, they, could, explain, the, economic, situations, according, to, schumpeter, capitalism, necessarily, goes, through, long, term, cycles, because, it, is, entirely, based, upon, scientific, inventions, and, innovations, a, phase, of, expansion, is, made, possible, by, innovations, because, they, bring, productivity, gains, and, encourage, entrepreneurs, to, invest, however, when, investors, have, no, more, opportunities, to, invest, the, economy, goes, into, recession, several, firms, collapse, closures, and, bankruptcy, occur, this, phase, lasts, until, new, innovations, bring, a, creative, destruction, process, i, e, they, destroy, old, products, reduce, the, employment, but, they, allow, the, economy, to, start, a, new, phase, of, growth, based, upon, new, products, and, new, factors, of, production, in, 1944, hungarian, american, mathematician, john, von, neumann, and, oskar, morgenstern, published, theory, of, games, and, economic, behavior, founding, game, theory, which, was, widely, adopted, by, economists, in, 1951, princeton, mathematician, john, forbes, nash, jr, published, the,

forgave, germany, its, war, debts, and, used, its, surpluses, to, rebuild, europe, and, encourage, reindustrialization, of, germany, and, japan, in, the, 1960s, it, changed, its, role, to, recycling, global, surpluses, after, world, war, ii, canadian, born, john, kenneth, galbraith, 1908, 2006, became, one, of, the, standard, bearers, for, pro, active, government, and, liberal, democrat, politics, in, the, affluent, society, 1958, galbraith, argued, that, voters, reaching, a, certain, material, wealth, begin, to, vote, against, the, common, good, he, also, argued, that, the, conventional, wisdom, of, the, conservative, consensus, was, not, enough, to, solve, the, problems, of, social, inequality, in, an, age, of, big, business, he, argued, it, is, unrealistic, to, think, of, markets, of, the, classical, kind, they, set, prices, and, use, advertising, to, create, artificial, demand, for, their, own, products, distorting, people, s, real, preferences, consumer, preferences, actually, come, to, reflect, those, of, corporations, a, dependence, effect, and, the, economy, as, a, whole, is, geared, to, irrational, goals, in, the, new, industrial, state, galbraith, argued, that, economic, decisions, are, planned, by, a, private, bureaucracy, a, technostructure, of, experts, who, manipulate, marketing, and, public, relations, channels, this, hierarchy, is, self, serving, profits, are, no, longer, the, prime, motivator, and, even, managers, are, not, in, control, because, they, are, the, new, planners, corporations, detest, risk, require, steady, economic, and, stable, markets, they, recruit, governments, to, serve, their, interests, with, fiscal, and, monetary, policy, for, instance, adhering, to, monetarist, policies, which, enrich, money, lenders, in, the, city, through, increases, in, interest, rates, while, the, goals, of, an, affluent, society, and, complicit, government, serve, the, irrational, technostructure, public, space, is, simultaneously, impoverished, galbraith, paints, the, picture, of, stepping, from, penthouse, villas, onto, unpaved, streets, from, landscaped, gardens, to, unkempt, public, parks, in, economics, and, the, public, purpose, 1973, galbraith, advocates, a, new, socialism, as, the, solution, nationalising, military, production, and, public, services, such, as, health, care, introducing, disciplined, salary, and, price, controls, to, reduce, inequality, in, contrast, to, galbraith, s, linguistic, style, the, post, war, economics, profession, began, to, synthesize, much, of, keynes, work, with, mathematical,
