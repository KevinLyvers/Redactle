including, un, security, council, resolution, 660, which, demanded, iraq, s, immediate, withdrawal, from, kuwait, and, the, imposition, of, comprehensive, international, sanctions, against, iraq,

naval, bombardment, of, iraq, on, 17, january, which, continued, for, five, weeks, as, the, iraqi, military, struggled, against, the, coalition, attacks, iraq, fired, missiles, at, israel, to, provoke, an, israeli, military, response, with, the, expectation, that, such, a, response, would, lead, to, the, withdrawal, of, several, muslim, majority, countries, from, the, coalition, the, provocation, was, unsuccessful, israel, did, not, retaliate, and, iraq, continued, to, remain, at, odds, with, most, muslim, majority, countries, iraqi, missile, barrages, against, coalition, targets, in, saudi, arabia, were, also, largely, unsuccessful, and, on, 24, february, 1991, the, coalition, launched, a, major, ground, assault, into, iraqi, occupied, kuwait, the, offensive, was, a, decisive, victory, for, the, coalition, who, liberated, kuwait, and, promptly, began, to, advance, past, the, iraq, kuwait, border, into, iraqi, territory, a, hundred, hours, after, the, beginning, of, the, ground, campaign, the, coalition, ceased, its, advance, into, iraq, and, declared, a, ceasefire, aerial, and, ground, combat, was, confined, to, iraq, kuwait, and, areas, straddling, the, iraq, saudi,

gulf, war, are, the, most, common, terms, for, the, conflict, used, within, western, countries, though, it, may, also, be, called, the, first, gulf, war, to, distinguish, it, from, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, and, the, subsequent, iraq, war, some, authors, have, called, it, the, second, gulf, war, to, distinguish, it, from, the, iran, iraq, war, liberation, of, kuwait, arabic, ta, r, r,

us, divided, the, conflict, into, three, major, campaigns, throughout, the, cold, war, iraq, had, been, an, ally, of, the, soviet, union, and, there, was, a, history, of, friction, between, iraq, and, the, united, states, the, us, was, concerned, with, iraq, s, position, on, israeli, palestinian, politics, the, us, also, disliked, iraqi, support, for, palestinian, militant, groups, which, led, to, iraq, s, inclusion, on, the, developing, us, list, of, state, sponsors, of, terrorism, in, december, 1979, the, us, remained, officially, neutral, after, iraq, s, invasion, of, iran, in, 1980, which, became, the, iran, iraq, war, although, it, provided, resources, political, support, and, some, non, military, aircraft, to, iraq, in, march, 1982, iran, began, a, successful, counteroffensive, operation, undeniable, victory, and, the, us, increased, its, support, for, iraq, to, prevent, iran, from, forcing, a, surrender, in, a, us, bid, to, open, full, diplomatic, relations, with, iraq, the, country, was, removed, from, the, us, list, of, state, sponsors, of, terrorism, ostensibly, this, was, because, of, improvement, in, the, regime, s, record, although, former, us, assistant, defense, secretary, noel, koch, later, stated, no, one, had, any, doubts, about, continued, involvement, in, terrorism, the, real, reason, was, to, help, them, succeed, in, the, war, against, iran, with, iraq, s, newfound, success, in, the, war, and, the, iranian, rebuff, of, a, peace, offer, in, july, arms, sales, to, iraq, reached, a, record, spike, in, 1982, when, iraqi, president, saddam, hussein, expelled, abu, nidal, to, syria, at, the, us, s, request, in, november, 1983, the, reagan, administration, sent, donald, rumsfeld, to, meet, saddam, as, a, special, envoy, and, to, cultivate, ties, by, the, time, the, ceasefire, with, iran, was, signed, in, august, 1988, iraq, was, heavily, debt, ridden, and, tensions, within, society, were, rising, most, of, its, debt, was, owed, to, saudi, arabia, and, kuwait, iraq, s, debts, to, kuwait, amounted, to, 14, billion, iraq, pressured, both, nations, to, forgive, the, debts, but, they, refused, the, iraq, kuwait, border, dispute, involved, iraqi, claims, to, kuwaiti, territory, kuwait, had, been, a, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, s, province, of, basra, something, that, iraq, claimed, made, kuwait, rightful, iraqi, territory, kuwait, s, ruling, dynasty, the, al, sabah, family, had, concluded, a, protectorate, agreement, in, 1899, that, assigned, responsibility, for, kuwait, s, foreign, affairs, to, the, united, kingdom, the, uk, drew, the, border, between, kuwait, and, iraq, in, 1922, making, iraq, almost, entirely, landlocked, kuwait, rejected, iraqi, attempts, to, secure, further, provisions, in, the, region, iraq, also, accused, kuwait, of, exceeding, its, opec, quotas, for, oil, production, in, order, for, the, cartel, to, maintain, its, desired, price, of, 18, per, barrel, discipline, was, required, the, united, arab, emirates, and, kuwait, were, consistently, overproducing, the, latter, at, least, in, part, to, repair, losses, caused, by, iranian, attacks, in, the, iran, iraq, war, and, to, pay, for, the, losses, of, an, economic, scandal, the, result, was, a, slump, in, the, oil, price, as, low, as, 10, per, barrel, 63, m, 3, with, a, resulting, loss, of, 7, billion, a, year, to, iraq, equal, to, its, 1989, balance, of, payments, deficit, resulting, revenues, struggled, to, support, the, government, s, basic, costs, let, alone, repair, iraq, s, damaged, infrastructure, jordan, and, iraq, both, looked, for, more, discipline, with, little, success, the, iraqi, government, described, it, as, a, form, of, economic, warfare, which, it, claimed, was, aggravated, by, kuwait, slant, drilling, across, the, border, into, iraq, s, rumaila, oil, field, according, to, oil, workers, in, the, area, iraq, s, slant, drilling, claim, was, fabricated, as, oil, flows, easily, from, the, rumaila, field, without, any, need, for, these, techniques, at, the, same, time, saddam, looked, for, closer, ties, with, those, arab, states, that, had, supported, iraq, in, the, war, this, move, was, supported, by, the, us, who, believed, that, iraqi, ties, with, pro, western, gulf, states, would, help, bring, and, maintain, iraq, inside, the, us, sphere, of, influence, in, 1989, it, appeared, that, saudi, iraqi, relations, strong, during, the, war, would, be, maintained, a, pact, of, non, interference, and, non, aggression, was, signed, between, the, countries, followed, by, a, kuwaiti, iraqi, deal, for, iraq, to, supply, kuwait, with, water, for, drinking, and, irrigation, although, a, request, for, kuwait, to, lease, iraq, umm, qasr, was, rejected, saudi, backed, development, projects, were, hampered, by, iraq, s, large, debts, even, with, the, demobilization, of, 200, 000, soldiers, iraq, also, looked, to, increase, arms, production, so, as, to, become, an, exporter, although, the, success, of, these, projects, was, also, restrained, by, iraq, s, obligations, in, iraq, resentment, to, opec, s, controls, mounted, iraq, s, relations, with, its, arab, neighbors, particularly, egypt, were, degraded, by, mounting, violence, in, iraq, against, expatriate, groups, who, were, well, employed, during, the, war, by, unemployed, iraqis, among, them, demobilized, soldiers, these, events, drew, little, notice, outside, the, arab, world, because, of, fast, moving, events, directly, related, to, the, fall, of, communism, in, eastern, europe, however, the, us, did, begin, to, condemn, iraq, s, human, rights, record, including, the, well, known, use, of, torture, the, uk, also, condemned, the, execution, of, farzad, bazoft, a, journalist, working, for, the, british, newspaper, the, observer, following, saddam, s, declaration, that, binary, chemical, weapons, would, be, used, on, israel, if, it, used, military, force, against, iraq, washington, halted, part, of, its, funding, a, un, mission, to, the, israeli, occupied, territories, where, riots, had, resulted, in, palestinian, deaths, was, vetoed, by, the, us, making, iraq, deeply, skeptical, of, us, foreign, policy, aims, in, the, region, combined, with, the, reliance, of, the, us, on, middle, eastern, energy, reserves, in, early, july, 1990, iraq, complained, about, kuwait, s, behavior, such, as, not, respecting, their, quota, and, openly, threatened, to, take, military, action, on, the, 23rd, the, cia, reported, that, iraq, had, moved, 30, 000, troops, to, the, iraq, kuwait, border, and, the, us, naval, fleet, in, the, persian, gulf, was, placed, on, alert, saddam, believed, an, anti, iraq, conspiracy, was, developing, kuwait, had, begun, talks, with, iran, and, iraq, s, rival, syria, had, arranged, a, visit, to, egypt, on, 15, july, 1990, saddam, s, government, laid, out, its, combined, objections, to, the, arab, league, including, that, policy, moves, were, costing, iraq, 1, billion, a, year, that, kuwait, was, still, using, the, rumaila, oil, field, and, that, loans, made, by, the, uae, and, kuwait, could, not, be, considered, debts, to, its, arab, brothers, he, threatened, force, against, kuwait, and, the, uae, saying, the, policies, of, some, arab, rulers, are, american, they, are, inspired, by, america, to, undermine, arab, interests, and, security, the, us, sent, aerial, refuelling, planes, and, combat, ships, to, the, persian, gulf, in, response, to, these, threats, discussions, in, jeddah, saudi, arabia, mediated, on, the, arab, league, s, behalf, by, egyptian, president, hosni, mubarak, were, held, on, 31, july, and, led, mubarak, to, believe, that, a, peaceful, course, could, be, established, it, was, revealed, during, saddam, hussein, s, 2003, 2004, interrogation, following, his, capture, that, in, addition, to, economic, disputes, an, insulting, exchange, between, the, kuwaiti, emir, al, sabah, and, the, iraqi, foreign, minister, during, which, saddam, claimed, that, the, emir, stated, his, intention, to, turn, every, iraqi, woman, into, a, 10, prostitute, by, bankrupting, the, country, was, a, decisive, factor, in, triggering, the, iraqi, invasion, on, the, 25th, saddam, met, with, april, glaspie, the, us, ambassador, to, iraq, in, baghdad, the, iraqi, leader, attacked, american, policy, with, regards, to, kuwait, and, the, uae, so, what, can, it, mean, when, america, says, it, will, now, protect, its, friends, it, can, only, mean, prejudice, against, iraq, this, stance, plus, maneuvers, and, statements, which, have, been, made, has, encouraged, the, uae, and, kuwait, to, disregard, iraqi, rights, if, you, use, pressure, we, will, deploy, pressure, and, force, we, know, that, you, can, harm, us, although, we, do, not, threaten, you, but, we, too, can, harm, you, everyone, can, cause, harm, according, to, their, ability, and, their, size, we, cannot, come, all, the, way, to, you, in, the, united, states, but, individual, arabs, may, reach, you, we, do, not, place, america, among, the, enemies, we, place, it, where, we, want, our, friends, to, be, and, we, try, to, be, friends, but, repeated, american, statements, last, year, made, it, apparent, that, america, did, not, regard, us, as, friends, glaspie, replied, i, know, you, need, funds, we, understand, that, and, our, opinion, is, that, you, should, have, the, opportunity, to, rebuild, your, country, but, we, have, no, opinion, on, the, arab, arab, conflicts, like, your, border, disagreement, with, kuwait, frankly, we, can, only, see, that, you, have, deployed, massive, troops, in, the, south, normally, that, would, not, be, any, of, our, business, but, when, this, happens, in, the, context, of, what, you, said, on, your, national, day, then, when, we, read, the, details, in, the, two, letters, of, the, foreign, minister, then, when, we, see, the, iraqi, point, of, view, that, the, measures, taken, by, the, uae, and, kuwait, is, in, the, final, analysis, parallel, to, military, aggression, against, iraq, then, it, would, be, reasonable, for, me, to, be, concerned, saddam, stated, that, he, would, attempt, last, ditch, negotiations, with, the, kuwaitis, but, iraq, would, not, accept, death, according, to, glaspie, s, own, account, she, stated, in, reference, to, the, precise, border, between, kuwait, and, iraq, that, she, had, served, in, kuwait, 20, years, before, then, as, now, we, took, no, position, on, these, arab, affairs, glaspie, similarly, believed, that, war, was, not, imminent, on, 26, july, 1990, only, a, few, days, before, the, iraqi, invasion, opec, officials, said, that, kuwait, and, the, united, arab, emirates, had, agreed, to, a, proposal, to, limit, their, oil, output, to, 1, 5, million, barrels, 240, 000, m, 3, per, day, down, from, the, nearly, 2, million, barrels, a, day, they, had, each, been, pumping, thus, potentially, settling, differences, over, oil, policy, between, kuwait, and, iraq, the, result, of, the, jeddah, talks, was, an, iraqi, demand, for, 10, billion, to, cover, the, lost, revenues, from, rumaila, kuwait, offered, 500, million, the, iraqi, response, was, to, immediately, order, an, invasion, which, started, on, 2, august, 1990, with, the, bombing, of, kuwait, s, capital, kuwait, city, before, the, invasion, the, kuwaiti, military, was, believed, to, have, numbered, 16, 000, men, arranged, into, three, armored, one, mechanized, infantry, and, one, under, strength, artillery, brigade, the, pre, war, strength, of, the, kuwait, air, force, was, around, 2, 200, kuwaiti, personnel, with, 80, fixed, wing, aircraft, and, 40, helicopters, in, spite, of, iraqi, saber, rattling, kuwait, did, not, mobilize, its, force, the, army, had, been, stood, down, on, 19, july, and, during, the, iraqi, invasion, many, kuwaiti, military, personnel, were, on, leave, by, 1988, at, the, end, of, the, iran, iraq, war, the, iraqi, army, was, the, world, s, fourth, largest, army, consisting, of, 955, 000, standing, soldiers, and, 650, 000, paramilitary, forces, in, the, popular, army, according, to, john, childs, and, andr, corvisier, a, low, estimate, shows, the, iraqi, army, capable, of, fielding, 4, 500, tanks, 484, combat, aircraft, and, 232, combat, helicopters, according, to, michael, knights, a, high, estimate, shows, the, iraqi, army, capable, of, fielding, one, million, troops, and, 850, 000, reservists, 5, 500, tanks, 3, 000, artillery, pieces, 700, combat, aircraft, and, helicopters, it, held, 53, divisions, 20, special, forces, brigades, and, several, regional, militias, and, had, a, strong, air, defense, iraqi, commandos, infiltrated, the, kuwaiti, border, first, to, prepare, for, the, major, units, which, began, the, attack, at, midnight, the, iraqi, attack, had, two, prongs, with, the, primary, attack, force, driving, south, straight, for, kuwait, city, down, the, main, highway, and, a, supporting, attack, force, entering, kuwait, farther, west, but, then, turning, and, driving, east, cutting, off, kuwait, city, from, the, country, s, southern, half, the, commander, of, a, kuwaiti, armored, battalion, 35th, armoured, brigade, deployed, them, against, the, iraqi, attack, and, conducted, a, robust, defense, at, the, battle, of, the, bridges, near, al, jahra, west, of, kuwait, city, kuwaiti, aircraft, scrambled, to, meet, the, invading, force, but, approximately, 20, were, lost, or, captured, a, few, combat, sorties, were, flown, against, iraqi, ground, forces, the, main, iraqi, thrust, into, kuwait, city, was, conducted, by, commandos, deployed, by, helicopters, and, boats, to, attack, the, city, from, the, sea, while, other, divisions, seized, the, airports, and, two, airbases, the, iraqis, attacked, the, dasman, palace, the, royal, residence, of, kuwait, s, emir, jaber, al, ahmad, al, jaber, al, sabah, which, was, defended, by, the, emiri, guard, supported, with, m, 84, tanks, in, the, process, the, iraqis, killed, fahad, al, ahmed, al, jaber, al, sabah, the, emir, s, youngest, brother, within, 12, hours, most, resistance, had, ended, within, kuwait, and, the,

kuwait, city, then, headed, south, and, redeployed, along, the, saudi, border, after, the, decisive, iraqi, victory, saddam, initially, installed, a, puppet, regime, known, as, the, provisional, government, of, free, kuwait, before, installing, his, cousin, ali, hassan, al, majid, as, kuwait, s, governor, on, 8, august, after, the, invasion, the, iraqi, military, looted, over, 1, billion, in, banknotes, from, kuwait, s, central, bank, at, the, same, time, saddam, hussein, made, the, kuwaiti, dinar, equal, to, the, iraqi, dinar, thereby, lowering, the, kuwaiti, currency, to, one, twelfth, of, its, original, value, in, response, sheikh, jaber, al, ahmad, al, sabah, ruled, the, banknotes, as, invalid, and, refused, to, reimburse, stolen, notes, which, became, worthless, because, of, a, un, embargo, after, the, conflict, ended, many, of, the, stolen, banknotes, made, their, way, back, into, circulation, today, the, stolen, banknotes, are, a, collectible, for, numismatists, kuwaitis,

and, western, hostages, the, resistance, predominantly, consisted, of, ordinary, citizens, who, lacked, any, form, of, training, and, supervision, a, key, element, of, us, political, military, and, energy, economic, planning, occurred, in, early, 1984, the, iran, iraq, war, had, been, going, on, for, five, years, by, that, time, and, both, sides, sustained, significant, casualties, reaching, into, the, hundreds, of, thousands, within, president, ronald, reagan, s, national, security, council, concern, was, growing, that, the, war, could, spread, beyond, the, boundaries, of, the, two, belligerents, a, national, security, planning, group, meeting, was, formed, chaired, by, then, vice, president, george, h, w, bush, to, review, us, options, it, was, determined, that, the, conflict, would, likely, spread, into, saudi, arabia, and, other, persian, gulf, states, but, that, the, united, states, had, little, capability, to, defend, the, region, furthermore, it, was, determined, that, a, prolonged, war, in, the, region, would, induce, much, higher, oil, prices, and, threaten, the, fragile, recovery, of, the, world, economy, which, was, just, beginning, to, gain, momentum, on, 22, may, 1984, president, reagan, was, briefed, on, the, project, conclusions, in, the, oval, office, by, william, flynn, martin, who, had, served, as, the, head, of, the, nsc, staff, that, organized, the, study, the, full, declassified, presentation, can, be, seen, here, the, conclusions, were, threefold, first, oil, stocks, needed, to, be, increased, among, members, of, the, international, energy, agency, and, if, necessary, released, early, if, the, oil, market, was, disrupted, second, the, united, states, needed, to, beef, up, the, security, of, friendly, arab, states, in, the,

leaders, headed, by, the, united, kingdom, s, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, in, the, london, summit, of, 1984, the, plan, was, implemented, and, became, the, basis, for, us, preparedness, to, respond, to, the, iraqi, occupation, of, kuwait, in, 1991, within, hours, of, the, invasion, kuwait, and, us, delegations, requested, a, meeting, of, the, un, security, council, which, passed, resolution, 660, condemning, the, invasion, and, demanding, a, withdrawal, of, iraqi, troops, on, 3, august, 1990, the, arab, league, passed, its, own, resolution, which, called, for, a, solution, to, the, conflict, from, within, the, league, and, warned, against, outside, intervention, iraq, and, libya, were, the, only, two, arab, league, states, that, opposed, the, resolution, for, iraq, to,

resolution, 661, placed, economic, sanctions, on, iraq, resolution, 665, followed, soon, after, which, authorized, a, naval, blockade, to, enforce, the, sanctions, it, said, the, use, of, measures, commensurate, to, the, specific, circumstances, as, may, be, necessary, to, halt, all, inward, and, outward, maritime, shipping, in, order, to, inspect, and, verify, their, cargoes, and, destinations, and, to, ensure, strict, implementation, of, resolution, 661, the, us, administration, had, at, first, been, indecisive, with, an, undertone, of, resignation, to, the, invasion, and, even, adaptation, to, it, as, a, fait, accompli, until, the, uk, s, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, played, a, powerful, role, reminding, the, president, that, appeasement, in, the, 1930s, had, led, to, war, that, saddam, would, have, the, whole, gulf, at, his, mercy, along, with, 65, percent, of, the, world, s, oil, supply, and, famously, urging, president, bush, not, to, go, wobbly, once, persuaded, us, officials, insisted, on, a, total, iraqi, pullout, from, kuwait, without, any, linkage, to, other, middle, eastern, problems, accepting, the, british, view, that, any, concessions, would, strengthen, iraqi, influence, in, the, region, for, years, to, come, on, 12, august, 1990, saddam, propose, that, all, cases, of, occupation, and, those, cases, that, have, been, portrayed, as, occupation, in, the, region, be, resolved, simultaneously, specifically, he, called, for, israel, to, withdraw, from, occupied, territories, in, palestine, syria, and, lebanon, syria, to, withdraw, from, lebanon, and, mutual, withdrawals, by, iraq, and, iran, and, arrangement, for, the, situation, in, kuwait, he, also, called, for, a, replacement, of, us, troops, that, mobilized, in, saudi, arabia, in, response, to, kuwait, s, invasion, with, an, arab, force, as, long, as, that, force, did, not, involve, egypt, additionally, he, requested, an, immediate, freeze, of, all, boycott, and, siege, decisions, and, a, general, normalization, of, relations, with, iraq, from, the, beginning, of, the, crisis, president, bush, was, strongly, opposed, to, any, linkage, between, iraq, s, occupation, of, kuwait, and, the, palestinian, issue, on, 23, august, saddam, appeared, on, state, television, with, western, hostages, to, whom, he, had, refused, exit, visas, in, the, video, he, asks, a, young, british, boy, stuart, lockwood, whether, he, is, getting, his, milk, and, goes, on, to, say, through, his, interpreter, we, hope, your, presence, as, guests, here, will, not, be, for, too, long, your, presence, here, and, in, other, places, is, meant, to, prevent, the, scourge, of, war, another, iraqi, proposal, communicated, in, august, 1990, was, delivered, to, us, national, security, advisor, brent, scowcroft, by, an, unidentified, iraqi, official, the, official, communicated, to, the, white, house, that, iraq, would, withdraw, from, kuwait, and, allow, foreigners, to, leave, provided, that, the, un, lifted, sanctions, allowed, guaranteed, access, to, the, persian, gulf, through, the, kuwaiti, islands, of, bubiyan, and, warbah, and, allowed, iraq, to, gain, full, control, of, the, rumaila, oil, field, that, extends, slightly, into, kuwaiti, territory, the, proposal, also, include, offers, to, negotiate, an, oil, agreement, with, the, united, states, satisfactory, to, both, nations, national, security, interests, develop, a, joint, plan, to, alleviate, iraq, s, economical, and, financial, problems, and, jointly, work, on, the, stability, of, the, gulf, on, 29, november, 1990, the, security, council, passed, resolution, 678, which, gave, iraq, until, 15, january, 1991, to, withdraw, from, kuwait, and, empowered, states, to, use, all, necessary, means, to, force, iraq, out, of, kuwait, after, the, deadline, in, december, 1990, iraq, made, a, proposal, to, withdraw, from, kuwait, provided, that, foreign, troops, left, the, region, and, that, an, agreement, was, reached, regarding, the, palestinian, problem, and, the, dismantlement, of, both, israel, s, and, iraq, s, weapons, of, mass, destruction, the, white, house, rejected, the, proposal, the, plo, s, yasser, arafat, expressed, that, neither, he, nor, saddam, insisted, that, solving, the, israel, palestine, issues, should, be, a, precondition, to, solving, the, issues, in, kuwait, though, he, did, acknowledge, a, strong, link, between, these, problems, ultimately, the, us, and, uk, stuck, to, their, position, that, there, would, be, no, negotiations, until, iraq, withdrew, from, kuwait, and, that, they, should, not, grant, iraq, concessions, lest, they, give, the, impression, that, iraq, benefited, from, its, military, campaign, also, when, us, secretary, of, state, james, baker, met, with, tariq, aziz, in, geneva, switzerland, for, last, minute, peace, talks, in, early, 1991, aziz, reportedly, made, no, concrete, proposals, and, did, not, outline, any, hypothetical, iraqi, moves, on, 14, january, 1991, france, proposed, that, the, un, security, council, call, for, a, rapid, and, massive, withdrawal, from, kuwait, along, with, a, statement, to, iraq, that, council, members, would, bring, their, active, contribution, to, a, settlement, of, the, region, s, other, problems, in, particular, of, the, arab, israeli, conflict, and, in, particular, to, the, palestinian, problem, by, convening, at, an, appropriate, moment, an, international, conference, to, assure, the, security, stability, and, development, of, this, region, of, the, world, the, french, proposal, was, supported, by, belgium, at, the, moment, one, of, the, rotating, council, members, germany, spain, italy, algeria, morocco, tunisia, and, several, non, aligned, states, the, us, the, uk, and, the, soviet, union, rejected, it, us, ambassador, to, the, un, thomas, pickering, stated, that, the, french, proposal, was, unacceptable, because, it, went, beyond, previous, council, resolutions, on, the, iraqi, invasion, france, dropped, this, proposal, when, it, found, no, tangible, sign, of, interest, from, baghdad, one, of, the, main, concerns, in, the, western, world, was, the, significant, threat, iraq, posed, to, saudi, arabia, following, kuwait, s, conquest, the, iraqi, army, was, within, easy, striking, distance, of, saudi, oil, fields, control, of, these, fields, along, with, kuwaiti, and, iraqi, reserves, would, have, given, saddam, control, over, the, majority, of, the, world, s, oil, reserves, iraq, also, had, a, number, of, grievances, with, saudi, arabia, the, saudis, had, lent, iraq, some, 26, billion, dollars, during, its, war, with, iran, the, saudis, had, backed, iraq, in, that, war, as, they, feared, the, influence, of, shia, iran, s, islamic, revolution, on, its, own, shia, minority, after, the, war, saddam, felt, he, should, not, have, to, repay, the, loans, due, to, the, help, he, had, given, the, saudis, by, fighting, iran, soon, after, his, conquest, of, kuwait, saddam, began, verbally, attacking, the, saudis, he, argued, that, the, us, supported, saudi, state, was, an, illegitimate, and, unworthy, guardian, of, the, holy, cities, of, mecca, and, medina, he, combined, the, language, of, the, islamist, groups, that, had, recently, fought, in, afghanistan, with, the, rhetoric, iran, had, long, used, to, attack, the, saudis, acting, on, the, carter, doctrine, policy, and, out, of, fear, the, iraqi, army, could, launch, an, invasion, of, saudi, arabia, us, president, george, h, w, bush, quickly, announced, that, the, us, would, launch, a, wholly, defensive, mission, to, prevent, iraq, from, invading, saudi, arabia, under, the, codename, operation, desert, shield, the, operation, began, on, 7, august, 1990, when, us, troops, were, sent, to, saudi, arabia, due, also, to, the, request, of, its, monarch, king, fahd, who, had, earlier, called, for, us, military, assistance, this, wholly, defensive, doctrine, was, quickly, abandoned, when, on, 8, august, iraq, declared, kuwait, to, be, iraq, s, 19th, province, and, saddam, named, his, cousin, ali, hassan, al, majid, as, its, military, governor, the, us, navy, dispatched, two, naval, battle, groups, built, around, the, aircraft, carriers, uss, dwight, d, eisenhower, and, uss, independence, to, the, persian, gulf, where, they, were, ready, by, 8, august, the, us, also, sent, the, battleships, uss, missouri, and, uss, wisconsin, to, the, region, a, total, of, 48, us, air, force, f, 15s, from, the, 1st, fighter, wing, at, langley, air, force, base, virginia, landed, in,

midway, and, 15, other, ships, 1, 100, aircraft, and, a, thousand, marines, in, a, press, conference, general, schwarzkopf, stated, that, these, exercises, were, intended, to, deceive, the, iraqi,

implement, resolution, 660, and, a, diplomatic, formulation, authorizing, the, use, of, force, if, iraq, failed, to, comply, to, ensure, that, the, us, received, economic, backing, james, baker, went, on, an, 11, day, journey, to, nine, countries, in, september, 1990, which, the, press, dubbed, the, tin, cup, trip, the, first, stop, was, saudi, arabia, which, a, month, before, had, already, granted, permission, to, the, united, states, to, use, its, facilities, however, baker, believed, that, saudi, arabia, should, assume, some, of, the, cost, of, the, military, efforts, to, defend, it, when, baker, asked, king, fahd, for, 15, billion, dollars, the, king, readily, agreed, with, the, promise, that, baker, ask, kuwait, for, the, same, amount, the, next, day, 7, september, he, did, just, that, and, the, emir, of, kuwait, displaced, in, a, sheraton, hotel, outside, his, invaded, country, easily, agreed, baker, then, moved, to, enter, talks, with, egypt, whose, leadership, he, considered, the, moderate, voice, of, the, middle, east, president, mubarak, of, egypt, was, furious, with, saddam, for, his, invasion, of, kuwait, and, for, the, fact, that, saddam, had, assured, mubarak, that, an, invasion, was, not, his, intention, egypt, received, approximately, 7, billion, in, debt, forgiveness, for, its, providing, of, support, and, troops, for, the, us, led,

its, role, in, the, crisis, with, its, president, hafez, assad, assad, had, a, deep, personal, enmity, towards, saddam, which, was, defined, by, the, fact, that, saddam, had, been, trying, to, kill, him, for, years, harboring, this, animosity, and, impressed, with, baker, s, diplomatic, initiative, to, visit, damascus, relations, had, been, severed, since, the, 1983, bombing, of, us, marine, barracks, in, beirut, assad, agreed, to, pledge, up, to, 100, 000, syrian, troops, to, the, coalition, effort, this, was, a, vital, step, in, ensuring, arab, states, were, represented, in, the, coalition, in, exchange, washington, gave, al, assad, the, green, light, to, wipe, out, forces, opposing, syria, s, rule, in, lebanon, and, arranged, for, weapons, valued, at, a, billion, dollars, to, be, provided, to, syria, mostly, through, gulf, states, in, exchange, for, iran, s, support, for, the, us, led, intervention, the, us, government, promised, the, iranian, government, to, end, us,

with, the, italians, in, which, he, was, promised, the, use, of, some, military, equipment, before, journeying, to, germany, to, meet, with, american, ally, chancellor, kohl, although, germany, s, constitution, which, was, brokered, essentially, by, the, united, states, prohibited, military, involvement, outside, germany, s, borders, kohl, committed, a, two, billion, dollar, contribution, to, the, coalition, s, war, effort, as, well, as, further, economic, and, military, support, of, coalition, ally, turkey, and, the, transportation, of, egyptian, soldiers, and, ships, to, the, persian,

the, coalition, countries, were, reluctant, to, commit, military, forces, some, felt, that, the, war, was, an, internal, arab, affair, or, did, not, want, to, increase, us, influence, in, the, middle, east, in, the, end, however, many, governments, were, persuaded, by, iraq, s, belligerence, towards, other, arab, states, offers, of, economic, aid, or, debt, forgiveness, and, threats, to, withhold, aid, the, us, and, the, un, gave, several, public, justifications, for, involvement, in, the, conflict, the, most, prominent, being, the, iraqi, violation, of, kuwaiti, territorial, integrity, in, addition, the, us, moved, to, support, its, ally, saudi, arabia, whose, importance, in, the, region, and, as, a, key, supplier, of, oil, made, it, of, considerable, geopolitical, importance, shortly, after, the, iraqi, invasion, us, defense, secretary, dick, cheney, made, the, first, of, several, visits, to, saudi, arabia, where, king, fahd, requested, us, military, assistance, during, a, speech, in, a, special, joint, session, of, the, us, congress, given, on, 11, september, 1990, bush, summed, up, the, reasons, with, the, following, remarks, within, three, days, 120, 000, iraqi, troops, with, 850, tanks, had, poured, into, kuwait, and, moved, south, to, threaten, saudi, arabia, it, was, then, that, i, decided, to, act, to, check, that, aggression, the, pentagon, stated, that, satellite, photos, showing, a, buildup, of, iraqi, forces, along, the, border, were, the, source, of, this, information, but, this, was, later, alleged, to, be, false, a, reporter, for, the, st, petersburg, times, acquired, two, commercial, soviet, satellite, images, made, at, the, time, which, showed, nothing, but, empty, desert, other, justifications, for, foreign, involvement, included, iraq, s, history, of, human, rights, abuses, under, saddam, iraq, was, also, known, to, possess, biological, weapons, and, chemical, weapons, which, saddam, had, used, against, iranian, troops, during, the, iran, iraq, war, and, against, his, own, country, s, kurdish, population, in, the, al, anfal, campaign, iraq, was, also, known, to, have, a, nuclear, weapons, program, but, the, report, about, it, from, january, 1991, was, partially, declassified, by, the, cia, on, 26, may, 2001, although, the, iraqi, military, committed, human, rights, abuses, during, the, invasion, the, alleged, incidents, that, received, the, most, publicity, in, the, us, were, fabrications, of, the, public, relations, firm, hired, by, the, government, of, kuwait, to, persuade, americans, to, support, military, intervention, shortly, after, iraq, s, invasion, of, kuwait, the, organization, citizens, for, a, free, kuwait, was, formed, in, the, us, it, hired, the, public, relations, firm, hill,

deployed, in, the, region, free, kuwait, t, shirts, and, speakers, to, college, campuses, and, dozens, of, video, news, releases, to, television, stations, the, firm, arranged, for, an, appearance, before, a, group, of, members, of, the, us, congress, in, which, a, young, woman, identifying, herself, as, a, nurse, working, in, the, kuwait, city, hospital, described, iraqi, soldiers, pulling, babies, out, of, incubators, and, letting, them, die, on, the, floor, the, story, helped, tip, both, the, public, and, congress, towards, a, war, with, iraq, six, congressmen, said, the, testimony, was, enough, for, them, to, support, military, action, against, iraq, and, seven, senators, referenced, the, testimony, in, debate, the, senate, supported, the, military, actions, in, a, 52, 47, vote, however, a, year, after, the, war, this, allegation, was, revealed, to, be, a, fabrication, the, young, woman, who, had, testified, was, found, to, be, a, member, of, kuwait, s, royal, family, and, the, daughter, of, kuwait, s, ambassador, to, the, us, she, hadn, t, lived, in, kuwait, during, the, iraqi, invasion, the, details, of, the, hill, knowlton, public, relations, campaign, including, the, incubator, testimony, were, published, in, john, r, macarthur, s, second, front, censorship, and, propaganda, in, the, gulf, war, and, came, to, wide, public, attention, when, an, op, ed, by, macarthur, was, published, in, the, new, york, times, this, prompted, a, reexamination, by, amnesty, international, which, had, originally, promoted, an, account, alleging, even, greater, numbers, of, babies, torn, from, incubators, than, the, original, fake, testimony, after, finding, no, evidence, to, support, it, the, organization, issued, a, retraction, president, bush, then, repeated, the, incubator, allegations, on, television, in, reality, the, iraqi, army, did, commit, various, well, documented, crimes, during, its, occupation, of, kuwait, such, as, the, summary, execution, without, trial, of, three, brothers, after, which, their, bodies, were, stacked, and, left, to, decay, in, a, public, street, iraqi, troops, also, ransacked, and, looted, private, kuwaiti, homes, one, residence, was, repeatedly, defecated, in, a, resident, later, commented, the, whole, thing, was, violence, for, the, sake, of, violence, destruction, for, the, sake, of, destruction, imagine, a, surrealistic, painting, by, salvador, dal, us, president, bush, repeatedly, compared, saddam, hussein, to, hitler, the, gulf, war, began, with, an, extensive, aerial, bombing, campaign, on, 16, january, 1991, for, 42, consecutive, days, and, nights, the, coalition, forces, subjected, iraq, to, one, of, the, most, intensive, air, bombardments, in, military, history, the, coalition, flew, over, 100, 000, sorties, dropping, 88, 500, tonnes, of, bombs, which, widely, destroyed, military, and, civilian, infrastructure, iraqi, anti, aircraft, defenses, including, man, portable, air, defense, systems, were, surprisingly, ineffective, against, enemy, aircraft, and, the, coalition, suffered, only, 75, aircraft, losses, in, over, 100, 000, sorties, 44, due, to, iraqi, action, two, of, these, losses, are, the, result, of, aircraft, colliding, with, the, ground, while, evading, iraqi, ground, fired, weapons, one, of, these, losses, is, a, confirmed, air, air, victory, iraq, s, government, made, no, secret, that, it, would, attack, israel, if, invaded, prior, to, the, war, s, start, in, the, aftermath, of, the, failed, us, iraq, peace, talks, in, geneva, switzerland, a, reporter, asked, iraq, s, english, speaking, foreign, minister, and, deputy, prime, minister, tariq, aziz, mr, foreign, minister, if, war, starts, will, you, attack, israel, his, response, was, yes, absolutely, yes, five, hours, after, the, first, attacks, iraq, s, state, radio, broadcast, declared, that, the, dawn, of, victory, nears, as, this, great, showdown, begins, iraq, fired, eight, missiles, the, next, day, these, missile, attacks, were, to, continue, throughout, the, war, iraq, fired, 88, scud, missiles, during, the, war, s, seven, weeks, iraq, hoped, to, provoke, a, military, response, from, israel, the, iraqi, government, hoped, that, many, arab, states, would, withdraw, from, the, coalition, as, they, would, be, reluctant, to, fight, alongside, israel, following, the, first, attacks, israeli, air, force, jets, were, deployed, to, patrol, the, northern, airspace, with, iraq, israel, prepared, to, militarily, retaliate, as, its, policy, for, the, previous, 40, years, had, always, been, retaliation, however, president, bush, pressured, israeli, prime, minister, yitzhak, shamir, not, to, retaliate, and, withdraw, israeli, jets, fearing, that, if, israel, attacked, iraq, the, other, arab, states, would, either, desert, the, coalition, or, join, iraq, it, was, also, feared, that, if, israel, used, syrian, or, jordanian, airspace, to, attack, iraq, they, would, intervene, in, the, war, on, iraq, s, side, or, attack, israel, the, coalition, promised, to, deploy, patriot, missiles, to, defend, israel, if, it, refrained, from, responding, to, the, scud, attacks, the, scud, missiles, targeting, israel, were, relatively, ineffective, as, firing, at, extreme, range, resulted, in, a, dramatic, reduction, in, accuracy, and, payload, two, israeli,

conference, iraq, was, authorized, to, fly, armed, helicopters, on, their, side, of, the, temporary, border, ostensibly, for, government, transit, due, to, the, damage, done, to, civilian, infrastructure, soon, after, these, helicopters, and, much, of, iraq, s, military, were, used, to, fight, an, uprising, in, the, south, on, march, 1, 1991, one, day, after, the, gulf, war, ceasefire, a, revolt, broke, out, in, basra, against, the, iraqi, government, the, uprising, spread, within, days, to, all, of, the, largest, shia, cities, in, southern, iraq, najaf, amarah, diwaniya, hilla, karbala, kut, nasiriyah, and, samawah, the, rebellions, were, encouraged, by, an, airing, of, the, voice, of, free, iraq, on, 24, february, 1991, which, was, broadcast, from, a, cia, run, radio, station, out, of, saudi, arabia, the, arabic, service, of, the, voice, of, america, supported, the, uprising, by, stating, that, the, rebellion, was, well, supported, and, that, they, would, soon, be, liberated, from, saddam, in, the, north, kurdish, leaders, took, american, statements, that, they, would, support, an, uprising, to, heart, and, began, fighting, hoping, to, trigger, a, coup, d, tat, however, when, no, us, support, came, iraqi, generals, remained, loyal, to, saddam, and, brutally, crushed, the, kurdish, uprising, and, the, uprising, in, the, south, millions, of, kurds, fled, across, the, mountains, to, turkey, and, kurdish, areas, of, iran, on, april, 5, the, iraqi, government, announced, the, complete, crushing, of, acts, of, sedition, sabotage, and, rioting, in, all, towns, of, iraq, an, estimated, 25, 000, to, 100, 000, iraqis, were, killed, in, the, uprisings, these, events, later, resulted, in, no, fly, zones, being, established, in, northern, and, southern, iraq, in, kuwait, the, emir, was, restored, and, suspected, iraqi, collaborators, were, repressed, eventually, over, 400, 000, people, were, expelled, from, the, country, including, a, large, number, of, palestinians, because, of, plo, support, of, saddam, yasser, arafat, did, not, apologize, for, his, support, of, iraq, but, after, his, death, mahmoud, abbas, formally, apologized, in, 2004, on, behalf, of, the, plo, this, came, after, the, kuwaiti, government, formally, forgave, the, group, there, was, some, criticism, of, the, bush, administration, as, they, chose, to, allow, saddam, to, remain, in, power, instead, of, pushing, on, to, capture, baghdad, and, overthrowing, his, government, in, their, co, written, 1998, book, a, world, transformed, bush, and, brent, scowcroft, argued, that, such, a, course, would, have, fractured, the, alliance, and, would, have, had, many, unnecessary, political, and, human, costs, associated, with, it, in, 1992, the, us, defense, secretary, during, the, war, dick, cheney, made, the, same, point, i, would, guess, if, we, had, gone, in, there, we, would, still, have, forces, in, baghdad, today, we, d, be, running, the, country, we, would, not, have, been, able, to, get, everybody, out, and, bring, everybody, home, and, the, final, point, that, i, think, needs, to, be, made, is, this, question, of, casualties, i, don, t, think, you, could, have, done, all, of, that, without, significant, additional, us, casualties, and, while, everybody, was, tremendously, impressed, with, the, low, cost, of, the, 1991, conflict, for, the, 146, americans, who, were, killed, in, action, and, for, their, families, it, wasn, t, a, cheap, war, and, the, question, in, my, mind, is, how, many, additional, american, casualties, is, saddam, worth, and, the, answer, is, not, that, damned, many, so, i, think, we, got, it, right, both, when, we, decided, to, expel, him, from, kuwait, but, also, when, the, president, made, the, decision, that, we, d, achieved, our, objectives, and, we, were, not, going, to, go, get, bogged, down, in, the, problems, of, trying, to, take, over, and, govern, iraq, on, 10, march, 1991, 540, 000, us, troops, began,

approximately, 375, remains, were, found, in, mass, graves, in, iraq, the, increased, importance, of, air, attacks, from, both, coalition, warplanes, and, cruise, missiles, led, to, controversy, over, the, number, of, civilian, deaths, caused, during, desert, storm, s, initial, stages, within, desert, storm, s, first, 24, hours, more, than, 1, 000, sorties, were, flown, many, against, targets, in, baghdad, the, city, was, the, target, of, heavy, bombing, as, it, was, the, seat, of, power, for, saddam, and, the, iraqi, forces, command, and, control, this, ultimately, led, to, civilian, casualties, in, one, noted, incident, two, usaf, stealth, planes, bombed, a, bunker, in, amiriyah, causing, the, deaths, of, 408, iraqi, civilians, in, the, shelter, scenes, of, burned, and, mutilated, bodies, were, subsequently, broadcast, and, controversy, arose, over, the, bunker, s, status, with, some, stating, that, it, was, a, civilian, shelter, while, others, contended, that, it, was, a, center, of, iraqi, military, operations, and, that, the, civilians, had, been, deliberately, moved, there, to, act, as, human, shields, saddam, s, government, gave, high, civilian, casualty, to, draw, support, from, islamic, countries, the, iraqi, government, claimed, that, 2, 300, civilians, died, during, the, air, campaign, according, to, the, project, on, defense, alternatives, study, 3, 664, iraqi, civilians, were, killed, in, the, conflict, during, the, nationwide, uprisings, against, the, ba, athist, iraqi, government, that, directly, followed, the, end, of, the, gulf, war, in, march, and, april, an, estimated, 25, 000, to, 100, 000, iraqis, were, killed, overwhelmingly, civilians, a, harvard, university, study, released, in, june, 1991, predicted, that, there, would, be, tens, of, thousands, of, additional, iraqi, civilian, deaths, by, the, end, of, 1991, due, to, the, public, health, catastrophe, caused, by, the, destruction, of, the, country, s, electrical, generating, capacity, without, electricity, hospitals, cannot, function, perishable, medicines, spoil, water, cannot, be, purified, and, raw, sewage, cannot, be, processed, the, us, government, refused, to, release, its, own, study, of, the, effects, of, the, iraqi, public, health, crisis, an, investigation, in, 1992, by, beth, osborne, daponte, estimated, about, 13, 000, civilians, were, directly, killed, in, the, war, while, another, 70, 000, died, indirectly, from, the, war, s, other, effects, according, to, a, 1992, study, published, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, by, researchers, known, as, the, international, study, team, ist, child, mortality, increased, threefold, as, a, result, of, the, war, with, 46, 900, children, under, the, age, of, 5, dying, between, january, and, august, 1991, however, these, figures, have, been, challenged, by, a, 2017, study, published, in, the, bmj, which, stated, that, the, ist, survey, probably, understated, the, level, of, child, mortality, that, prevailed, during, 1985, 1990, and, overstated, the, level, during, 1991, according, to, this, study, there, was, no, major, rise, in, child, mortality, in, iraq, after, 1990, a, report, published, in, 2002, by, medact, estimated, the, total, number, of, iraqi, deaths, caused, directly, and, indirectly, by, the, gulf, war, to, be, between, 142, 500, and, 206, 000, including, 100, 000, 120, 000, military, deaths, and, 20, 000, 35, 000, civilian, deaths, in, the, civil, war, and, 15, 000, 30, 000, refugee, deaths, after, the, end, of, the, gulf, war, iraq, also, launched, numerous, attacks, on, civilian, targets, in, israel, and, saudi, arabia, a, 1991, report, by, middle, east, watch, said, that, at, least, one, saudi, civilian, was, killed, after, they, were, hit, by, iraqi, shelling, in, riyadh, disputed, amounts, of, people, were, also, killed, during, the, iraqi, rocket, attacks, on, israel, a, united, nations, report, in, march, 1991, described, the, effect, on, iraq, of, the, us, led, bombing, campaign, as, near, apocalyptic, bringing, back, iraq, to, the, pre, industrial, age, the, exact, number, of, iraqi, combat, casualties, is, unknown, but, is, believed, to, have, been, heavy, some, estimate, that, iraq, sustained, between, 20, 000, and, 35, 000, fatalities, a, report, commissioned, by, the, us, air, force, estimated, 10, 000, 12, 000, iraqi, combat, deaths, in, the, air, campaign, and, as, many, as, 10, 000, casualties, in, the, ground, war, this, analysis, is, based, on, iraqi, prisoner, of, war, reports, according, to, the, project, on, defense, alternatives, study, between, 20, 000, and, 26, 000, iraqi, military, personnel, were, killed, in, the, conflict, while, 75, 000, others, were, wounded, according, to, kanan, makiya, for, the, iraqi, people, the, cost, of, enforcing, the, will, of, the, united, nations, has, been, grotesque, general, schwarzkopf, talked, about, a, very, very, large, number, of, dead, in, these, units, a, very, very, large, number, indeed, the, chairman, of, the, house, armed, services, committee, les, aspin, estimated, that, at, least, 65, 000, iraqi, soldiers, were, killed, a, figure, was, supported, by, israeli, sources, who, speak, of, one, to, two, hundred, thousand, iraqi, casualties, most, of, the, killing, took, place, during, the, ground, war, fleeing, soldiers, were, bombed, with, a, device, known, as, a, fuel, air, explosive, the, us, department, of, defense, reports, that, us, forces, suffered, 148, battle, related, deaths, 35, to, friendly, fire, with, one, pilot, listed, as, mia, his, remains, were, found, and, identified, in, august, 2009, a, further, 145, americans, died, in, non, combat, accidents, the, uk, suffered, 47, deaths, nine, to,

458, americans, 190, coalition, troops, were, killed, by, iraqi, combatants, the, rest, of, the, 379, coalition, deaths, were, from, friendly, fire, or, accidents, this, number, was, much, lower, than, expected, among, the, american, combat, dead, were, four, female, soldiers, while, the, death, toll, among, coalition, forces, engaging, iraqi, combatants, was, very, low, a, substantial, number, of, deaths, were, caused, by, accidental, attacks, from, other, allied, units, of, the, 148, us, troops, who, died, in, battle, 24, were, killed, by, friendly, fire, a, total, of, 35, service,

gulf, war, illness, gwi, common, symptoms, reported, are, chronic, fatigue, fibromyalgia, and, gastrointestinal, disorder, there, has, been, widespread, speculation, and, disagreement, about, the, causes, of, the, illness, and, the, possibly, related, birth, defects, researchers, found, that, infants, born, to, male, veterans, of, the, 1991, war, had, higher, rates, of, two, types, of, heart, valve, defects, some, children, born, after, the, war, to, gulf, war, veterans, had, a, certain, kidney, defect, that, was, not, found, in, gulf, war, veterans, children, born, before, the, war, researchers, have, said, that, they, did, not, have, enough, information, to, link, birth, defects, with, exposure, to, toxic, substances, in, 1994, the, us, senate, committee, on, banking, housing, and, urban, affairs, with, respect, to, export, administration, published, a, report, entitled, u, s, chemical, and, biological, warfare, related, dual, use, exports, to, iraq, and, their, possible, impact, on, the, health, consequences, of, the, gulf, war, this, publication, called, the, riegle, report, summarized, testimony, this, committee, had, received, establishing, that, the, u, s, had, in, the, 1980s, supplied, saddam, hussein, with, chemical, and, biological, warfare, technology, that, saddam, had, used, such, chemical, weapons, against, iran, and, his, own, native, kurds, and, possibly, against, u, s, soldiers, as, well, plausibly, contributing, to, the, gws, a, 2022, study, by, dr, robert, w, haley, of, the, university, of, texas, southwestern, medical, center, et, al, of, 1, 016, u, s, gulf, war, veterans, found, evidence, of, a, causal, link, between, gws, and, exposure, to, low, levels, of, the, nerve, agent, sarin, which, was, released, into, the, air, by, coalition, bombing, of, iraqi, chemical, weapons, facilities, significantly, the, study, found, an, increased, incidence, of, gws, not, only, among, veterans, who, recounted, hearing, nerve, agent, alarms, but, also, among, veterans, with, the, rr, or, qr, as, opposed, to, the, qq, forms, of, the, pon1, gene, which, produces, an, enzyme, that, deactivates, organophosphates, including, sarin, through, hydrolysis, by, contrast, gws, was, inversely, associated, with, higher, levels, of, the, type, q, isozyme, which, is, more, efficient, at, breaking, down, sarin, than, its, type, r, counterpart, the, authors, found, that, the, pon1, genotype, and, hearing, nerve, agent, alarms, were, independent, and, the, findings, robust, to, both, measured, and, unmeasured, confounding, supporting, a, mechanistic, interaction, moreover, the, change, in, the, combined, effect, from, one, category, to, the, next, was, significantly, greater, than, the, sum, of, the, independent, effects, of, the, environmental, exposure, and, the, genotype, the, us, military, used, depleted, uranium, in, tank, kinetic, energy, penetrators, and, 20, 30, mm, 0, 79, 1, 18, in, cannon, ordnance, significant, controversy, regarding, the, long, term, safety, of, depleted, uranium, exists, including, claims, of, pyrophoric, genotoxic, and, teratogenic, heavy, metal, effects, many, have, cited, its, use, during, the, war, as, a, contributing, factor, to, a, number, of, major, health, issues, in, veterans, and, in, surrounding, civilian, populations, including, in, birth, defects, and, child, cancer, rates, scientific, opinion, on, the, risk, is, mixed, in, 2004, iraq, had, the, highest, mortality, rate, due, to, leukemia, of, any, country, depleted, uranium, has, 40, less, radioactivity, than, natural, uranium, but, the, negative, effects, should, not, be, overlooked, depleted, uranium, is, not, a, significant, health, hazard, unless, it, is, taken, into, the, body, external, exposure, to, radiation, from, depleted, uranium, is, generally, not, a, major, concern, because, the, alpha, particles, emitted, by, its, isotopes, travel, only, a, few, centimeters, in, air, or, can, be, stopped, by, a, sheet, of, paper, also, the, uranium, 235, that, remains, in, depleted, uranium, emits, only, a, small, amount, of, low, energy, gamma, radiation, however, if, allowed, to, enter, the, body, depleted, uranium, like, natural, uranium, has, the, potential, for, both, chemical, and, radiological, toxicity, with, the, two, important, target, organs, being, the, kidneys, and, the, lungs, in, the, night, of, 26, 27, february, 1991, some, iraqi, forces, began, leaving, kuwait, on, the, main, highway, north, of, al, jahra, in, a, column, of, some, 1, 400, vehicles, a,

already, learned, to, scamper, off, into, the, desert, when, our, aircraft, started, to, attack, nevertheless, some, people, back, home, wrongly, chose, to, believe, we, were, cruelly, and, unusually, punishing, our, already, whipped, foes, by, february, 27, talk, had, turned, toward, terminating, the, hostilities, kuwait, was, free, we, were, not, interested, in, governing, iraq, so, the, question, became, how, do, we, stop, the, killing, another, incident, during, the, war, highlighted, the, question, of, large, scale, iraqi, combat, deaths, this, was, the, bulldozer, assault, wherein, two, brigades, from, the, us, 1st, infantry, division, mechanized, were, faced, with, a, large, and, complex, trench, network, as, part, of, the, heavily, fortified, saddam, hussein, line, after, some, deliberation, they, opted, to, use, anti, mine, plows, mounted, on, tanks, and, combat, earthmovers, to, simply, plow, over, and, bury, alive, the, defending, iraqi, soldiers, not, a,

the, war, to, reinforce, the, idea, that, there, would, be, an, amphibious, assault, attempt, about, 30, 40, of, this, came, from, allied, raids, on, iraqi, coastal, targets, the, kuwaiti, oil, fires, were, caused, by, the, iraqi, military, setting, fire, to, 700, oil, wells, as, part, of, a, scorched, earth, policy, while, retreating, from, kuwait, in, 1991, after, conquering, the, country, but, being, driven, out, by, coalition, forces, the, fires, started, in, january, and, february, 1991, and, the, last, one, was, extinguished, by, november, the, resulting, fires, burned, uncontrollably, because, of, the, dangers, of, sending, in, firefighting, crews, land, mines, had, been, placed, in, areas, around, the, oil, wells, and, a, military, cleaning, of, the, areas, was, necessary, before, the, fires, could, be, put, out, somewhere, around, 6, million, barrels, 950, 000, m, 3, of, oil, were, lost, each, day, eventually, privately, contracted, crews, extinguished, the, fires, at, a, total, cost, of, us, 1, 5, billion, to, kuwait, by, that, time, however, the, fires, had, burned, for, approximately, 10, months, causing, widespread, pollution, the, cost, of, the, war, to, the, united, states, was, calculated, by, the, us, congress, in, april, 1992, to, be, 61, 1, billion, equivalent, to, 119, billion, in, 2023, about, 52, billion, of, that, amount, was, paid, by, other, countries, 36, billion, by, kuwait, saudi, arabia, and, other, arab, states, of, the, persian, gulf, 16, billion, by, germany, and, japan, which, sent, no, combat, forces, due, to, their, constitutions, about, 25, of, saudi, arabia, s, contribution, was, paid, with, in, kind, services, to, the, troops, such, as, food, and, transportation, us, troops, represented, about, 74, of, the, combined, force, and, the, global, cost, was, therefore, higher, apart, from, the, impact, on, arab, states, of, the, persian, gulf, the, resulting, economic, disruptions, after, the, crisis, affected, many, states, the, overseas, development, institute, odi, undertook, a, study, in, 1991, to, assess, the, effects, on, developing, states, and, the, international, community, s, response, a, briefing, paper, finalized, on, the, day, that, the, conflict, ended, draws, on, their, findings, which, had, two, main, conclusions, many, developing, states, were, severely, affected, and, while, there, has, been, a, considerable, response, to, the, crisis, the, distribution, of, assistance, was, highly, selective, the, odi, factored, in, elements, of, cost, which, included, oil, imports, remittance, flows, re, settlement, costs, loss, of, export, earnings, and, tourism, for, egypt, the, cost, totaled, 1, billion, 3, of, gdp, yemen, had, a, cost, of, 830, million, 10, of, gdp, while, it, cost, jordan, 1, 8, billion, 32, of, gdp, international, response, to, the, crisis, on, developing, states, came, with, the, channeling, of, aid, through, the, gulf, crisis, financial, co, ordination, group, they, were, 24, states, comprising, most, of, the, oecd, countries, plus, some, gulf, states, saudi, arabia, united, arab, emirates, qatar, and, kuwait, the, members, of, this, group, agreed, to, disperse, 14, billion, in, development, assistance, the, world, bank, responded, by, speeding, up, the, disbursement, of, existing, project, and, adjustment, loans, the, international, monetary, fund, adopted, two, lending, facilities, the, enhanced, structural, adjustment, facility, esaf, and, the, compensatory, contingency, financing, facility, ccff, the, european, community, offered, 2, billion, in, assistance, us, policy, regarding, media, freedom, was, much, more, restrictive, than, in, the, vietnam, war, the, policy, had, been, spelled, out, in, a, pentagon, document, entitled, annex, foxtrot, most, of, the, press, information, came, from, briefings, organized, by, the, military, only, selected, journalists, were, allowed, to, visit, the, front, lines, or, conduct, interviews, with, soldiers, those, visits, were, always, conducted, in, the, presence, of, officers, and, were, subject, to, both, prior, approval, by, the, military, and, censorship, afterward, this, was, ostensibly, to, protect, sensitive, information, from, being, revealed, to, iraq, this, policy, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, military, s, experience, with, the, vietnam, war, in, which, public, opposition, within, the, us, grew, throughout, the, war, s, course, it, was, not, only, the, limitation, of, information, in, the, middle, east, media, were, also, restricting, what, was, shown, about, the, war, with, more, graphic, depictions, like, ken, jarecke, s, image, of, a, burnt, iraqi, soldier, being, pulled, from, the, american, ap, wire, whereas, in, europe, it, was, given, extensive, coverage, two, bbc, journalists, john, simpson, and, bob, simpson, no, relation, defied, their, editors, and, remained, in, baghdad, to, report, on, the, war, s, progress, they, were, responsible, for, a, report, which, included, an, infamous, cruise, missile, that, travelled, down, a, street, and, turned, left, at, a, traffic, light, alternative, media, outlets, provided, views, opposing, the, war, deep, dish, television, compiled, segments, from, independent, producers, in, the, us, and, abroad, and, produced, a, 10, hour, series, that, was, distributed,

was, the, title, of, another, program, in, the, series, it, focused, on, the, media, s, complicity, in, promoting, the, war, as, well, as, americans, reactions, to, the, media, coverage, media, watchdog, group, fairness, and, accuracy, in, reporting, fair, critically, analyzed, media, coverage, during, the, war, in, various, articles, and, books, such, as, the, 1991, gulf, war, coverage, the, worst, censorship, was, at, home, precision, guided, munitions, were, heralded, as, key, in, allowing, military, strikes, to, be, made, with, a, minimum, of, civilian, casualties, compared, to, previous, wars, although, they, were, not, used, as, often, as, more, traditional, less, accurate, bombs, specific, buildings, in, downtown, baghdad, could, be, bombed, while, journalists, in, their, hotels, watched, cruise, missiles, fly, by, precision, guided, munitions, amounted, to, approximately, 7, 4, of, all, bombs, dropped, by, the, coalition, other, bombs, included, cluster, bombs, which, disperse, numerous, submunitions, and, daisy, cutters, 15, 000, pound, bombs, which, can, disintegrate, everything, within, hundreds, of, yards, global, positioning, system, gps, units, were, relatively, new, at, the, time, and, were, important, in, enabling, coalition, units, to, easily, navigate, across, the, desert, since, military, gps, receivers, were, not, available, for, most, troops, many, used, commercially, available, units, to, permit, these, to, be, used, to, best, effect, the, selective, availability, feature, of, the, gps, system, was, turned, off, for, the, duration, of, desert, storm, allowing, these, commercial, receivers, to, provide, the, same, precision, as, the, military, equipment, airborne, warning, and, control, system, awacs, and, satellite, communication, systems, were, also, important, two, examples, of, this, are, the, us, navy, s, grumman, e, 2, hawkeye, and, the, us, air, force, s, boeing, e, 3, sentry, both, were, used, in, command, and, control, area, of, operations, these, systems, provided, essential, communications, links, between, air, ground, and, naval, forces, it, is, one, of, several, reasons, coalition, forces, dominated, the, air, war, american, made, color, photocopiers, were, used, to, produce, some, of, iraq, s, battle, plans, some, of, the, copiers, contained, concealed, high, tech, transmitters, that, revealed, their, positions, to, american, electronic, warfare, aircraft, leading, to, more, precise, bombings, the, role, of, iraq, s, scud, missiles, featured, prominently, in, the, war, scud, is, a, tactical, ballistic, missile, that, the, soviet, union, developed, and, deployed, among, the, forward, deployed, soviet, army, divisions, in, east, germany, scud, missiles, utilize, inertial,

casualties, while, others, caused, little, damage, the, us, patriot, missile, was, used, in, combat, for, the, first, time, the, us, military, claimed, a, high, effectiveness, against, scuds, at, the, time, but, later, analysis, gives, figures, as, low, as, 9, with, 45, of, the, 158, patriot, launches, being, against, debris, or, false, targets, the, dutch, ministry, of, defense, which, also, sent, patriot, missiles, to, protect, civilians, in, israel, and, turkey, later, disputed, the, higher, claim, further, there, is, at, least, one, incident, of, a, software, error, causing, a, patriot, missile, s, failure, to, engage, an, incoming, scud, resulting, in, deaths, both, the, us, army, and, the, missile, manufacturers, maintained, the, patriot, delivered, a, miracle, performance, in,
