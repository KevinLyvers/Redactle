are, used, historiographically, to, distinguish, it, from, the, current, republic, of, colombia, which, is, also, the, official, name, of, the, former, state, however, international, recognition, of, the, legitimacy, of, the, gran, colombian, state, ran, afoul, of, european, opposition, to, the, independence, of, states, in, the, americas, austria, france, and, russia, only, recognized, independence, in, the, americas, if, the, new, states, accepted, monarchs, from, european, dynasties, in, addition, colombia, and, the, international, powers, disagreed, over, the, extension, of, the, colombian, territory, and, its, boundaries, gran, colombia, was, proclaimed, through, the, fundamental, law, of, the, republic, of, colombia, issued, during, the, congress, of, angostura, 1819, but,

was, marked, by, a, struggle, between, those, who, supported, a, centralized, government, with, a, strong, presidency, and, those, who, supported, a, decentralized, federal, form, of, government, at, the, same, time, another, political, division, emerged, between, those, who, supported, the, constitution, of, c, cuta, and, two, groups, who, sought, to, do, away, with, the, constitution, either, in, favor, of, breaking, up, the, country, into, smaller, republics, or, maintaining, the, union, but, creating, an, even, stronger, presidency, the, faction, that, favored, constitutional, rule, coalesced, around, vice, president, francisco, de, paula, santander, while, those, who, supported, the, creation, of, a, stronger, presidency, were, led, by, president, sim, n, bol, var, the, two, of, them, had, been, allies, in, the, war, against, spanish, rule, but, by, 1825, their, differences, had, become, public, and, were, an, important, part, of, the, political, instability, from, that, year, onward, gran, colombia, was, dissolved, in, 1831, due, to, the, political, differences, that, existed, between, supporters, of, federalism, and, centralism, as, well, as, regional, tensions, among, the, peoples, that, made, up, the, republic, it, broke, into, the, successor, states, of, colombia, ecuador, and, venezuela, panama, was, separated, from, colombia, in, 1903, since, gran,

mosquito, coast, as, well, as, most, of, esequiba, its, proclaimed, name, was, the, republic, of, colombia, historians, have, adopted, the, term, gran, colombia, to, distinguish, this, republic, from, the, present, day, republic, of, colombia, which, began, using, the, name, in, 1863, although, many, use, colombia, where, the, confusion, would, not, arise, the, name, colombia, is, the, spanish, version, of, the, eighteenth, century, neo, latin, word, columbia, which, derives, from, the, family, name, of, the, genoese, explorer, christopher, columbus, it, was, the, term, proposed, by, the, venezuelan, revolutionary, francisco, de, miranda, to, denote, the, new, world, region, of, the, western, hemisphere, especially, to, all, american, territories, and, colonies, under, spanish, rule, he, used, an, improvised, quasi, greek, adjectival, version, of, the, name, colombia, to, mean, papers, and, things, relating, to, colombia, as, the, title, of, the, archive, of, his, revolutionary, activities, sim, n, bol, var, and, other, spanish, american, revolutionaries, also, used, the, word, colombia, in, the, continental, sense, the, 1819, proclamation, of, a, country, with, the, name, colombia, by, the, congress, of, angostura, gave, the, term, a, specific, geographic, and, political, reference, the, total, population, of, gran, colombia, after, independence, was, 2, 583, 799, with, indians, numbering, 1, 200, 000, people, or, 50, of, the, population, however, in, the, modern, day, territory, of, colombia, the, population, was, 1, 327, 000, including, 700, 000, indians, which, made, up, 53, of, the, population, of, the, territory, of, colombia, it, was, proclaimed, by, the, congress, of, c, cuta, in, 1821, in, the, constitution, of, c, cuta, and, had, been, promulgated, through, the, fundamental, law, of, the, republic, of, colombia, during, the, congress, of, angostura, 1819, the, territory, it, claimed, loosely, corresponded, to, the, former, territories, of, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, 1739, 1777, which, it, claimed, under, the, legal, principle, of, uti, possidetis, it, united, the, territories, of, the, former, third, republic, of, venezuela, the, united, provinces, of, new, granada, the, former, royal, audiencia, of, panama, and, the, presidency, of, quito, which, was, still, under, spanish, rule, in, 1821, since, the, new, country, was, proclaimed, soon, after, bol, var, s, unexpected, victory, in, new, granada, its, government, was, temporarily, set, up, as, a, federal, republic, made, up, of, three, departments, headed, by, a, vice, president, and, with, capitals, in, the, cities, of, bogot, cundinamarca, department, caracas, venezuela, department, and, quito, quito, department, in, that, year, none, of, the, provinces, of, quito, nor, many, in, venezuela, and, new, granada, were, free, yet, the, constitution, of, c, cuta, was, drafted, in, 1821, at, the, congress, of, c, cuta, establishing, the, republic, s, capital, in, bogot, bol, var, and, santander, were, appointed, by, the, congress, as, the, country, s, president, and, vice, president, a, great, degree, of, centralization, was, established, by, the, assembly, at, c, cuta, since, several, new, granadan, and, venezuelan, deputies, of, the, congress, who, formerly, had, been, ardent, federalists, now, came, to, believe, that, centralism, was, necessary, to, successfully, manage, the, war, against, the, royalists, to, break, up, regionalist, tendencies, and, to, set, up, efficient, central, control, of, local, administration, a, new, territorial, division, was, implemented, in, 1824, the, departments, of, venezuela, cundinamarca, and, quito, were, split, into, smaller, departments, each, governed, by, an, intendant, appointed, by, the, central, government, with, the, same, powers, that, bourbon, intendants, had, realizing, that, not, all, of, the, provinces, were, represented, at, c, cuta, because, many, areas, of, the, country, remained, in, royalist, hands, the, congress, called, for, a, new, constitutional, convention, to, meet, in, ten, years, in, its, first, years, it, helped, other, provinces, still, at, war, with, spain, to, become, independent, all, of, venezuela, except, puerto, cabello, was, liberated, at, the, battle, of, carabobo, panama, joined, the, federation, in, november, 1821, and, the, provinces, of, pasto, guayaquil, and, quito, in, 1822, that, year, colombia, became, the, first, spanish, american, republic, recognized, by, the, united, states, due, to, the, efforts, of, diplomat, manuel, torres, its, army, later, consolidated, the, independence, of, peru, in, 1824, bol, var, and, santander, were, re, appointed, by, the, national, congress, in, 1826, gran, colombia, was, constituted, as, a, unitary, centralist, state, its, history, was, marked, by, a, struggle, between, those, who, supported, a, centralized, government, with, a, strong, presidency, and, those, who,

federalist, and, regionalist, sentiments, that, had, been, suppressed, for, the, sake, of, the, war, arose, once, again, there, were, calls, for, a, modification, of, the, political, division, and, related, economic, and, commercial, disputes, between, regions, reappeared, ecuador, had, important, economic, and, political, grievances, since, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, its, textile, industry, had, suffered, because, cheaper, textiles, were, being, imported, after, independence, it, adopted, a, low, tariff, policy, which, benefited, agricultural, regions, such, as, venezuela, moreover, from, 1820, to, 1825, the, area, was, ruled, directly, by, bol, var, because, of, the, extraordinary, powers, granted, to, him, his, top, priority, was, the, war, in, peru, against, the, royalists, not, solving, ecuador, s, economic, problems, having, been, incorporated, later, ecuador, was, also, underrepresented, in, all, branches, of, the, central, government, and, ecuadorians, had, little, opportunity, to, rise, to, command, positions, in, its, army, even, local, political, offices, were, often, staffed, by, venezuelans, and, new, granadans, no, outright, separatist, movement, emerged, in, ecuador, but, these, problems, were, never, resolved, in, the, ten, year, existence, of, the, country, the, strongest, calls, for, a, federal, arrangement, instead, came, from, venezuela, where, there, was, strong, federalist, sentiment, among, the, region, s, liberals, many, of, whom, had, not, fought, in, the, war, of, independence, but, had, supported, spanish, liberalism, in, the, previous, decade, and, who, now, allied, themselves, with, the, conservative, commandant, general, of, the, department, of, venezuela, jos, antonio, p, ez, against, the, central, government, in, 1826, venezuela, came, close, to, seceding, that, year, congress, began, impeachment, proceedings, against, p, ez, who, resigned, his, post, on, april, 28, but, reassumed, it, two, days, later, in, defiance, of, the, central, government, support, for, p, ez, and, his, revolt, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, cosiata, a, venezuelan, colloquialism, of, the, time, meaning, the, insignificant, thing, in, venezuelan, history, spread, throughout, venezuela, aided, by, the, fact, that, it, did, not, explicitly, stand, for, anything, except, defiance, to, the, central, government, nevertheless, the, support, p, ez, received, from, across, the, venezuelan, political, spectrum, posed, a, serious, threat, to, the, unity, of, the, country, in, july, and, august, the, municipal, government, of, guayaquil, and, a, junta, in, quito, issued, declarations, of, support, for, p, ez, s, actions, bol, var, for, his, part, used, the, developments, to, promote, the, conservative, constitution, he, had, just, written, for, bolivia, which, found, support, among, conservative, ecuadorians, and, the, venezuelan, military, officialdom, but, was, generally, met, with, indifference, or, outright, hostility, among, other, sectors, of, society, and, most, importantly, for, future, political, developments, by, vice, president, santander, himself, in, november, two, assemblies, met, in, venezuela, to, discuss, the, future, of, the, region, but, no, formal, independence, was, declared, at, either, that, same, month, skirmishes, broke, out, between, the, supporters, of, p, ez, and, bol, var, in, the, east, and, south, of, venezuela, by, the, end, of, the, year, bol, var, was, in, maracaibo, preparing, to, march, into, venezuela, with, an, army, if, necessary, ultimately, political, compromises, prevented, this, in, january, bol, var, offered, the, rebellious, venezuelans, a, general, amnesty, and, the, promise, to, convene, a, new, constituent, assembly, before, the, ten, year, period, established, by, the, constitution, of, c, cuta, and, p, ez, backed, down, and, recognized, bol, var, s, authority, the, reforms, however, never, fully, satisfied, its, different, political, factions, and, no, permanent, consolidation, was, achieved, the, instability, of, the, state, s, structure, was, now, apparent, to, all, in, 1828, the, new, constituent, assembly, the, convention, of, oca, a, began, its, sessions, at, its, opening, bol, var, again, proposed, a, new, constitution, based, on, the, bolivian, one, but, this, suggestion, continued, to, be, unpopular, the, convention, fell, apart, when, pro, bol, var, delegates, walked, out, rather, than, sign, a, federalist, constitution, after, this, failure, bol, var, believed, that, by, centralizing, his, constitutional, powers, he, could, prevent, the, separatists, the, new, granadians, represented, mainly, by, francisco, de, paula, santander, and, jos, mar, a, obando, and, the, venezuelans, by, jos, antonio, p, ez, from, bringing, down, the, union, he, ultimately, failed, to, do, so, as, the, collapse, of, the, country, became, evident, in, 1830, bol, var, resigned, from, the, presidency, internal, political, strife, between, the, different, regions, intensified, even, as, general, rafael, urdaneta, temporarily, took, power, in, bogot, attempting, to, use, his, authority, to, ostensibly, restore, order, but, actually, hoping, to, convince, bol, var, to, return, to, the, presidency, and, the, country, to, accept, him, the, federation, finally, dissolved, in, the, closing, months, of, 1830, and, was, formally, abolished, in, 1831, venezuela, ecuador, and, new, granada, came, to, exist, as, independent, states, on, 3, june, 1828, bol, var, declared, war, on, peru, over, gran, colombian, claims, on, the, peruvian, territories, of, ja, n, and, maynas, the, war, ended, in, the, treaty, of, guayaquil, which, was, signed, on, 22, september, 1829, and, went, into, effect, on, 27, october, 1829, the, dissolution, of, gran, colombia, represented, the, failure, of, bol, var, s, vision, the, former, republic, was, replaced, by, the, republics, of, venezuela, ecuador, and, new, granada, the, former, department, of, cundinamarca, as, established, in, 1819, at, the, congress, of, angostura, became, a, new, country, the, republic, of, new, granada, in, 1858, new, granada, was, replaced, by, the, granadine, confederation, later, in, 1863, the, granadine, confederation, changed, its, name, officially, to, the, united, states, of, colombia, and, in, 1886, adopted, its, present, day, name, the, republic, of, colombia, panama, which, voluntarily, became, part, of, it, in, 1821, remained, a, department, of, the, republic, of, colombia, until, 1903, when, in, great, part, as, a, consequence, of, the, thousand, days, war, of, 1899, 1902, it, became, independent, under, intense, american, pressure, the, united, states, wanted, territorial, rights, in, the, future, panama, canal, zone, which, colombia, had, refused, with, the, exception, of, panama, which, as, mentioned, achieved, independence, seven, decades, later, the, countries, that, were, created, have, similar, flags, reminiscent, of, the, flag, of, gran, colombia, before, a, new, constitution, could, be, written, by, the, 1821, congress, of, c, cuta, the, 1819, congress, of, angostura, appointed, bol, var, and, santander, president, and, vice, president, respectively, under, the, constitution, of, c, cuta, the, country, was, divided, into, twelve, departments, each, governed, by, an, intendant, departments, were, further, divided, into, thirty, six, provinces, each, headed, by, a, governor, who, had, overlapping, powers, with, the, intendant, military, affairs, at, the, department, level, were, overseen, by, a, commandant, general, who, could, also, be, the, intendant, all, three, offices, were, appointed, by, the, central, government, the, central, government, which, temporarily, was, to, reside, in, bogot, consisted, of, a, presidency, a, bicameral, congress, and, a, high, court, the, alta, corte, the, president, was, the, head, of, the, executive, branch, of, both, the, central, and, local, governments, the, president, could, be, granted, extraordinary, powers, in, military, fronts, such, as, the, area, that, became, ecuador, the, vice, president, assumed, the, presidency, in, case, of, the, absence, death, demotion, or, illness, of, the, president, since, president, bol, var, was, absent, from, gran, colombia, for, the, early, years, of, its, existence, executive, power, was, wielded, by, the, vice, president, santander, the, vote, was, given, to, persons, who, owned, 100, pesos, in, landed, property, or, had, an, equivalent, income, from, a, profession, elections, were, indirect, in, peru, the, dissolution, of, gran, colombia, is, seen, as, a, country, ceasing, to, exist, giving, way, to, the, formation, of, new, nation, states, the, significance, of, this, view, is, that, the, treaties, peru, had, signed, with, gran, colombia, became, void, when, the, countersignatory, ceased, to, exist, the, three, new, states, the, republic, of, new, granada, which, later, changed, its, name, to, republic, of, colombia, the, republic, of, venezuela, and, the, republic, of, ecuador, in, the, peruvian, view, started, with, a, clean, diplomatic, slate, an, alternative, view, is, that, ecuador, and, venezuela, separated, from, the, gran, colombian, federation, and, inherited, all, of, the, treaty, obligations, that, gran, colombia, had, assumed, at, least, to, the, extent, that, they, apply, to, their, respective, territories, there, are, indications, that, colombia, itself, maintained, this, position, gran, colombia, and, its, successor, state, the, republic, of, colombia, shared, a, capital, city, a, subset, of, the, same, territory, and, much, the, same, citizenry, it, would, be, unnatural, to, disavow, their, common, histories, the, question, of, the, status, of, treaties, and, accords, dating, to, the, revolutionary, period, 1809, 1819, and, gran, colombia, period, 1819, 1830, has, a, profound, effect, on, international, relations, to, the, present, day, there, have, been, attempts, at, the, reunification, of, gran, colombia, since, the, separation, of, panama, from, colombia, in, 1903, people, in, favor, of, reunification, are, called, unionistas, or, unionists, in, 2008, the, bolivarian, news, agency, reported, that, the, then, president, of, venezuela, hugo,
