in, classical, antiquity, the, hellenistic, period, covers, the, time, in, mediterranean, history, after, classical, greece, between, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bc, and, the, death, of, cleopatra, vii, in, 30, bc, which, was, followed, by, the, ascendancy, of, the, roman, empire, as, signified, by, the, battle, of, actium, in, 31, bc, and, the, roman, conquest, of, ptolemaic, egypt, the, following, year, which, eliminated, the, last, major, hellenistic, kingdom, its, name, stems, from, the, ancient, greek, word, hellas, hell, s, which, was, gradually, recognized, as, the, name, for, greece, from, which, the, early, modern, 19th, century, historiographical, term, hellenistic, was, derived, the, term, hellenistic, is, to, be, distinguished, from, hellenic, in, that, the, latter, refers, to, greece, itself, while, the, former, encompasses, all, the, ancient, territories, of, the, period, which, had, come, under, significant, greek, influence, in, particular, the, hellenized, middle, east, after, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, after, the, macedonian, conquest, of, the, achaemenid, empire, in, 330, bc, and, its, disintegration, shortly, thereafter, in, the, partition, of, babylon, and, subsequent, wars, of, the, diadochi, hellenistic, monarchies, were, established, throughout, south, west, asia, seleucid, empire, kingdom, of, pergamon, north, east, africa, ptolemaic, kingdom, and, south, asia, greco, bactrian, kingdom, indo, greek, kingdom, this, resulted, in, an, influx, of, greek, colonists, and, the, export, of, greek, culture, and, language, to, these, new, realms, a, breadth, spanning, as, far, as, modern, day, india, these, new, greek, kingdoms, were, also, influenced, by, the, indigenous, cultures, adopting, local, practices, where, deemed, beneficial, necessary, or, convenient, hellenistic, culture, thus, represents, a, fusion, of, the, ancient, greek, world, with, that, of, western, asian, northeastern, african, and, southwestern, asian, the, consequence, of, this, mixture, gave, rise, to, a, common, attic, based, greek, dialect, known, as, koine, greek, which, became, the, lingua, franca, throughout, the, ancient, world, during, the, hellenistic, period, greek, cultural, influence, reached, its, peak, in, the, mediterranean, and, beyond, prosperity, and, progress, in, the, arts, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and, science, characterize, the, era, the, hellenistic, period, saw, the, rise, of, new, comedy, alexandrian, poetry, translation, efforts, such, as, the, septuagint, and, the, philosophies, of, stoicism, epicureanism, and, pyrrhonism, in, science, the, works, of, the, mathematician, euclid, and, the, polymath, archimedes, are, exemplary, sculpture, during, this, period, was, characterized, by, intense, emotion, and, dynamic, movement, as, seen, in, sculptural, works, like, the, dying, gaul, and, the, venus, de, milo, a, form, of, hellenistic, architecture, arose, which, especially, emphasized, the, building, of, grand, monuments, and, ornate, decorations, as, exemplified, by, structures, such, as, the, pergamon, altar, the, religious, sphere, of, greek, religion, expanded, through, syncretic, facets, to, include, new, gods, such, as, the, greco, egyptian, serapis, eastern, deities, such, as, attis, and, cybele, and, a, syncretism, between, hellenistic, culture, and, buddhism, in, bactria, and, northwest, india, scholars, and, historians, are, divided, as, to, which, event, signals, the, end, of, the, hellenistic, era, there, is, a, wide, chronological, range, of, proposed, dates, that, have, included, the, final, conquest, of, the, greek, heartlands, by, the, expansionist, roman, republic, in, 146, bc, following, the, achaean, war, the, final, defeat, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, at, the, battle, of, actium, in, 31, bc, the, end, of, the, reign, of, the, emperor, hadrian, in, ad, 138, and, the, move, by, the, emperor, constantine, the, great, of, the, capital, of, the, roman, empire, to, constantinople, in, ad, 330, though, this, scope, of, suggested, dates, demonstrates, a, range, of, academic, opinion, a, generally, accepted, date, by, most, of, scholarship, has, been, that, of, 31, 30, bc, the, word, originated, from, ancient, greek, hell, nist, s, one, who, uses, the, greek, language, from, hell, s, greece, as, if, hellenist, ic, the, idea, of, a, hellenistic, period, is, a, 19th, century, concept, and, did, not, exist, in, ancient, greece, although, words, related, in, form, or, meaning, e, g, hellenist, ancient, greek, hell, nist, s, have, been, attested, since, ancient, times, it, has, been, attributed, to, the, 19th, century, german, historian, johann, gustav, droysen, who, in, his, classic, work, geschichte, des, hellenismus, history, of, hellenism, coined, the, term, hellenistic, to, refer, to, and, define, the, period, when, greek, culture, spread, in, the, non, greek, world, after, alexander, s, conquest, following, droysen, hellenistic, and, related, terms, e, g, hellenism, have, been, widely, used, in, various, contexts, a, notable, such, use, is, in, culture, and, anarchy, by, matthew, arnold, where, hellenism, is, used, in, contrast, with, hebraism, the, major, issue, with, the, term, hellenistic, lies, in, its, convenience, as, the, spread, of, greek, culture, was, not, the, generalized, phenomenon, that, the, term, implies, some, areas, of, the, conquered, world, were, more, affected, by, greek, influences, than, others, the, term, hellenistic, also, implies, that, the, greek, populations, were, of, majority, in, the, areas, in, which, they, settled, but, in, many, cases, the, greek, settlers, were, actually, the, minority, among, the, native, populations, the, greek, population, and, the, native, population, did, not, always, mix, the, greeks, moved, and, brought, their, own, culture, but, interaction, did, not, always, occur, while, a, few, fragments, exist, there, are, no, complete, surviving, historical, works, that, date, to, the, hundred, years, following, alexander, s, death, the, works, of, the, major, hellenistic, historians, hieronymus, of, cardia, who, worked, under, alexander, antigonus, i, and, other, successors, duris, of, samos, and, phylarchus, which, were, used, by, surviving, sources, are, all, lost, the, earliest, and, most, credible, surviving, source, for, the, hellenistic, period, is, polybius, of, megalopolis, c, 200, 118, a, statesman, of, the, achaean, league, until, 168, bc, when, he, was, forced, to, go, to, rome, as, a, hostage, his, histories, eventually, grew, to, a, length, of, forty, books, covering, the, years, 220, to, 167, bc, the, most, important, source, after, polybius, is, diodorus, siculus, who, wrote, his, bibliotheca, historica, between, 60, and, 30, bc, and, reproduced, some, important, earlier, sources, such, as, hieronymus, but, his, account, of, the, hellenistic, period, breaks, off, after, the, battle, of, ipsus, 301, bc, another, important, source, plutarch, s, c, ad, 50, c, 120, parallel, lives, although, more, preoccupied, with, issues, of, personal, character, and, morality, outlines, the, history, of, important, hellenistic, figures, appian, of, alexandria, late, 1st, century, ad, before, 165, wrote, a, history, of, the, roman, empire, that, includes, information, of, some, hellenistic, kingdoms, other, sources, include, justin, s, 2nd, century, ad, epitome, of, pompeius, trogus, historiae, philipicae, and, a, summary, of, arrian, s, events, after, alexander, by, photios, i, of, constantinople, lesser, supplementary, sources, include, curtius, rufus, pausanias, pliny, and, the, byzantine, encyclopedia, the, suda, in, the, field, of, philosophy, diogenes, la, rtius, lives, and, opinions, of, eminent, philosophers, is, the, main, source, works, such, as, cicero, s, de, natura, deorum, also, provide, some, further, detail, of, philosophical, schools, in, the, hellenistic, period, inscriptions, on, stone, or, metal, were, commonly, erected, throughout, the, greek, world, for, public, display, a, practice, which, originated, well, before, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, but, saw, substantial, expansion, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, majority, of, these, inscriptions, are, located, on, the, greek, mainland, the, greek, islands, and, western, asia, minor, while, they, become, increasingly, rare, towards, the, eastern, regions, they, are, not, entirely, absent, there, and, they, are, most, notably, featured, in, public, buildings, and, sanctuaries, the, content, of, these, inscriptions, is, diverse, encompassing, royal, correspondence, addressed, to, cities, or, individuals, municipal, and, legal, edicts, decrees, commemorating, rulers, officials, and, individuals, for, their, contributions, as, well, as, laws, treaties, religious, rulings, and, dedications, despite, challenges, in, their, interpretation, inscriptions, are, often, the, only, source, available, for, understanding, numerous, events, in, greek, history, papyrus, served, as, the, predominant, medium, for, handwritten, documents, across, the, hellenistic, world, though, its, production, was, confined, to, egypt, due, to, egypt, s, arid, climate, papyrus, manuscripts, was, almost, exclusively, preserved, there, as, well, that, being, said, the, different, historical, periods, are, not, represented, equally, in, the, papyrological, documents, texts, from, the, reign, of, ptolemy, i, are, notably, scarce, while, those, from, the, reign, of, ptolemy, ii, are, more, frequently, encountered, this, is, owing, in, part, to, the, large, quantities, of, papyri, which, were, stuffed, into, human, and, animal, mummies, during, his, rule, papyri, have, been, classified, into, public, and, private, documents, including, literary, texts, laws, and, regulations, official, correspondence, petitions, records, and, archives, or, collections, of, documents, belonging, to, individuals, of, position, and, authority, significant, information, about, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, which, might, otherwise, have, been, lost, has, been, preserved, in, papyrological, documents, this, is, particularly, noteworthy, given, the, limited, documentation, available, for, their, seleucid, counterparts, ancient, greece, had, traditionally, been, a, fractious, collection, of, fiercely, independent, city, states, after, the, peloponnesian, war, 431, 404, bc, greece, had, fallen, under, a, spartan, hegemony, in, which, sparta, was, pre, eminent, but, not, all, powerful, spartan, hegemony, was, succeeded, by, a, theban, hegemony, after, the, battle, of, leuctra, 371, bc, but, after, the, battle, of, mantinea, 362, bc, all, of, greece, was, so, weakened, that, no, one, state, could, claim, pre, eminence, it, was, against, this, backdrop, that, the, ascendancy, of, macedon, began, under, king, philip, ii, macedon, was, located, at, the, periphery, of, the, greek, world, and, although, its, royal, family, claimed, greek, descent, the, macedonians, themselves, were, looked, down, upon, as, semi, barbaric, by, the, rest, of, the, greeks, however, macedon, controlled, a, large, area, and, had, a, relatively, strong, centralized, government, in, comparison, to, most, greek, states, philip, ii, was, a, strong, and, expansionist, king, who, took, every, opportunity, to, expand, macedonian, territory, in, 352, bc, he, annexed, thessaly, and, magnesia, in, 338, bc, philip, defeated, a, combined, theban, and, athenian, army, at, the, battle, of, chaeronea, after, a, decade, of, desultory, conflict, in, the, aftermath, philip, formed, the, league, of, corinth, effectively, bringing, the, majority, of, greece, under, his, direct, sway, he, was, elected, hegemon, of, the, league, and, a, campaign, against, the, achaemenid, empire, of, persia, was, planned, however, in, 336, bc, while, this, campaign, was, in, its, early, stages, he, was, assassinated, succeeding, his, father, alexander, took, over, the, persian, war, himself, during, a, decade, of, campaigning, alexander, conquered, the, whole, persian, empire, overthrowing, the, persian, king, darius, iii, the, conquered, lands, included, asia, minor, assyria, the, levant, egypt, mesopotamia, media, persia, and, parts, of, modern, day, afghanistan, pakistan, and, the, steppes, of, central, asia, the, years, of, constant, campaigning, had, taken, their, toll, however, and, alexander, died, in, 323, bc, after, his, death, the, huge, territories, alexander, had, conquered, became, subject, to, a, strong, greek, influence, hellenization, for, the, next, two, or, three, centuries, until, the, rise, of, rome, in, the, west, and, of, parthia, in, the, east, as, the, greek, and, levantine, cultures, mingled, the, development, of, a, hybrid, hellenistic, culture, began, and, persisted, even, when, isolated, from, the, main, centres, of, greek, culture, for, instance, in, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, it, can, be, argued, that, some, of, the, changes, across, the, macedonian, empire, after, alexander, s, conquests, and, during, the, rule, of, the, diadochi, would, have, occurred, without, the, influence, of, greek, rule, as, mentioned, by, peter, green, numerous, factors, of, conquest, have, been, merged, under, the, term, hellenistic, period, specific, areas, conquered, by, alexander, s, invading, army, including, egypt, and, areas, of, asia, minor, and, mesopotamia, fell, willingly, to, conquest, and, viewed, alexander, as, more, of, a, liberator, than, a, conqueror, in, addition, much, of, the, area, conquered, would, continue, to, be, ruled, by, the, diadochi, alexander, s, generals, and, successors, initially, the, whole, empire, was, divided, among, them, however, some, territories, were, lost, relatively, quickly, or, only, remained, nominally, under, macedonian, rule, after, 200, years, only, much, reduced, and, rather, degenerate, states, remained, until, the, conquest, of, ptolemaic, egypt, by, rome, when, alexander, the, great, died, 10, june, 323, bc, he, left, behind, a, sprawling, empire, which, was, composed, of, many, essentially, autonomous, territories, called, satrapies, without, a, chosen, successor, there, were, immediate, disputes, among, his, generals, as, to, who, should, be, king, of, macedon, these, generals, became, known, as, the, diadochi, greek, diadokhoi, meaning, successors, meleager, and, the, infantry, supported, the, candidacy, of, alexander, s, half, brother, philip, arrhidaeus, while, perdiccas, the, leading, cavalry, commander, supported, waiting, until, the, birth, of, alexander, s, child, by, roxana, after, the, infantry, stormed, the, palace, of, babylon, a, compromise, was, arranged, arrhidaeus, as, philip, iii, should, become, king, and, should, rule, jointly, with, roxana, s, child, assuming, that, it, was, a, boy, as, it, was, becoming, alexander, iv, perdiccas, himself, would, become, regent, epimeletes, of, the, empire, and, meleager, his, lieutenant, soon, however, perdiccas, had, meleager, and, the, other, infantry, leaders, murdered, and, assumed, full, control, the, generals, who, had, supported, perdiccas, were, rewarded, in, the, partition, of, babylon, by, becoming, satraps, of, the, various, parts, of, the, empire, but, perdiccas, position, was, shaky, because, as, arrian, writes, everyone, was, suspicious, of, him, and, he, of, them, the, first, of, the, diadochi, wars, broke, out, when, perdiccas, planned, to, marry, alexander, s, sister, cleopatra, and, began, to, question, antigonus, i, monophthalmus, leadership, in, asia, minor, antigonus, fled, for, greece, and, then, together, with, antipater, and, craterus, the, satrap, of, cilicia, who, had, been, in, greece, fighting, the, lamian, war, invaded, anatolia, the, rebels, were, supported, by, lysimachus, the, satrap, of, thrace, and, ptolemy, the, satrap, of, egypt, although, eumenes, satrap, of, cappadocia, defeated, the, rebels, in, asia, minor, perdiccas, himself, was, murdered, by, his, own, generals, peithon, seleucus, and, antigenes, possibly, with, ptolemy, s, aid, during, his, invasion, of, egypt, c, 21, may, to, 19, june, 320, bc, ptolemy, came, to, terms, with, perdiccas, s, murderers, making, peithon, and, arrhidaeus, regents, in, his, place, but, soon, these, came, to, a, new, agreement, with, antipater, at, the, treaty, of, triparadisus, antipater, was, made, regent, of, the, empire, and, the, two, kings, were, moved, to, macedon, antigonus, remained, in, charge, of, asia, minor, ptolemy, retained, egypt, lysimachus, retained, thrace, and, seleucus, i, controlled, babylon, the, second, diadochi, war, began, following, the, death, of, antipater, in, 319, bc, passing, over, his, own, son, cassander, antipater, had, declared, polyperchon, his, successor, as, regent, cassander, rose, in, revolt, against, polyperchon, who, was, joined, by, eumenes, and, was, supported, by, antigonus, lysimachus, and, ptolemy, in, 317, bc, cassander, invaded, macedonia, attaining, control, of, macedon, sentencing, olympias, to, death, and, capturing, the, boy, king, alexander, iv, and, his, mother, in, asia, eumenes, was, betrayed, by, his, own, men, after, years, of, campaign, and, was, given, up, to, antigonus, who, had, him, executed, the, third, war, of, the, diadochi, broke, out, because, of, the, growing, power, and, ambition, of, antigonus, he, began, removing, and, appointing, satraps, as, if, he, were, king, and, also, raided, the, royal, treasuries, in, ecbatana, persepolis, and, susa, making, off, with, 25, 000, talents, seleucus, was, forced, to, flee, to, egypt, and, antigonus, was, soon, at, war, with, ptolemy, lysimachus, and, cassander, he, then, invaded, phoenicia, laid, siege, to, tyre, stormed, gaza, and, began, building, a, fleet, ptolemy, invaded, syria, and, defeated, antigonus, son, demetrius, poliorcetes, in, the, battle, of, gaza, of, 312, bc, which, allowed, seleucus, to, secure, control, of, babylonia, and, the, eastern, satrapies, in, 310, bc, cassander, had, young, king, alexander, iv, and, his, mother, roxana, murdered, ending, the, argead, dynasty, which, had, ruled, macedon, for, several, centuries, antigonus, then, sent, his, son, demetrius, to, regain, control, of, greece, in, 307, bc, he, took, athens, expelling, demetrius, of, phaleron, cassander, s, governor, and, proclaiming, the, city, free, again, demetrius, now, turned, his, attention, to, ptolemy, defeating, his, fleet, at, the, battle, of, salamis, and, taking, control, of, cyprus, in, the, aftermath, of, this, victory, antigonus, took, the, title, of, king, basileus, and, bestowed, it, on, his, son, demetrius, poliorcetes, the, rest, of, the, diadochi, soon, followed, suit, demetrius, continued, his, campaigns, by, laying, siege, to, rhodes, and, conquering, most, of, greece, in, 302, bc, creating, a, league, against, cassander, s, macedon, the, decisive, engagement, of, the, war, came, when, lysimachus, invaded, and, overran, much, of, western, anatolia, but, was, soon, isolated, by, antigonus, and, demetrius, near, ipsus, in, phrygia, seleucus, arrived, in, time, to, save, lysimachus, and, utterly, crushed, antigonus, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, in, 301, bc, seleucus, war, elephants, proved, decisive, antigonus, was, killed, and, demetrius, fled, back, to, greece, to, attempt, to, preserve, the, remnants, of, his, rule, there, by, recapturing, a, rebellious, athens, meanwhile, lysimachus, took, over, ionia, seleucus, took, cilicia, and, ptolemy, captured, cyprus, after, cassander, s, death, in, c, 298, bc, however, demetrius, who, still, maintained, a, sizable, loyal, army, and, fleet, invaded, macedon, seized, the, macedonian, throne, 294, bc, and, conquered, thessaly, and, most, of, central, greece, 293, 291, bc, he, was, defeated, in, 288, bc, when, lysimachus, of, thrace, and, pyrrhus, of, epirus, invaded, macedon, on, two, fronts, and, quickly, carved, up, the, kingdom, for, themselves, demetrius, fled, to, central, greece, with, his, mercenaries, and, began, to, build, support, there, and, in, the, northern, peloponnese, he, once, again, laid, siege, to, athens, after, they, turned, on, him, but, then, struck, a, treaty, with, the, athenians, and, ptolemy, which, allowed, him, to, cross, over, to, asia, minor, and, wage, war, on, lysimachus, holdings, in, ionia, leaving, his, son, antigonus, gonatas, in, greece, after, initial, successes, he, was, forced, to, surrender, to, seleucus, in, 285, bc, and, later, died, in, captivity, lysimachus, who, had, seized, macedon, and, thessaly, for, himself, was, forced, into, war, when, seleucus, invaded, his, territories, in, asia, minor, and, was, defeated, and, killed, in, 281, bc, at, the, battle, of, corupedium, near, sardis, seleucus, then, attempted, to, conquer, lysimachus, european, territories, in, thrace, and, macedon, but, he, was, assassinated, by, ptolemy, ceraunus, the, thunderbolt, who, had, taken, refuge, at, the, seleucid, court, and, then, had, himself, acclaimed, as, king, of, macedon, ptolemy, was, killed, when, macedon, was, invaded, by, gauls, in, 279, bc, his, head, stuck, on, a, spear, and, the, country, fell, into, anarchy, antigonus, ii, gonatas, invaded, thrace, in, the, summer, of, 277, and, defeated, a, large, force, of, 18, 000, gauls, he, was, quickly, hailed, as, king, of, macedon, and, went, on, to, rule, for, 35, years, at, this, point, the, tripartite, territorial, division, of, the, hellenistic, age, was, in, place, with, the, main, hellenistic, powers, being, macedon, under, demetrius, s, son, antigonus, ii, gonatas, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, under, ptolemy, s, son, ptolemy, ii, and, the, seleucid, empire, under, seleucus, son, antiochus, i, soter, epirus, was, a, northwestern, greek, kingdom, in, the, western, balkans, ruled, by, the, molossian, aeacidae, dynasty, epirus, was, an, ally, of, macedon, during, the, reigns, of, philip, ii, and, alexander, in, 281, pyrrhus, nicknamed, the, eagle, aetos, invaded, southern, italy, to, aid, the, city, state, of, tarentum, pyrrhus, defeated, the, romans, in, the, battle, of, heraclea, and, at, the, battle, of, asculum, though, victorious, he, was, forced, to, retreat, due, to, heavy, losses, hence, the, term, pyrrhic, victory, pyrrhus, then, turned, south, and, invaded, sicily, but, was, unsuccessful, and, returned, to, italy, after, the, battle, of, beneventum, 275, bc, pyrrhus, lost, all, his, italian, holdings, and, left, for, epirus, pyrrhus, then, went, to, war, with, macedonia, in, 275, bc, deposing, antigonus, ii, gonatas, and, briefly, ruling, over, macedonia, and, thessaly, until, 272, afterwards, he, invaded, southern, greece, and, was, killed, in, battle, against, argos, in, 272, bc, after, the, death, of, pyrrhus, epirus, remained, a, minor, power, in, 233, bc, the, aeacid, royal, family, was, deposed, and, a, federal, state, was, set, up, called, the, epirote, league, the, league, was, conquered, by, rome, in, the, third, macedonian, war, 171, 168, bc, antigonus, ii, a, student, of, zeno, of, citium, spent, most, of, his, rule, defending, macedon, against, epirus, and, cementing, macedonian, power, in, greece, first, against, the, athenians, in, the, chremonidean, war, and, then, against, the, achaean, league, of, aratus, of, sicyon, under, the, antigonids, macedonia, was, often, short, on, funds, the, pangaeum, mines, were, no, longer, as, productive, as, under, philip, ii, the, wealth, from, alexander, s, campaigns, had, been, used, up, and, the, countryside, pillaged, by, the, gallic, invasion, a, large, number, of, the, macedonian, population, had, also, been, resettled, abroad, by, alexander, or, had, chosen, to, emigrate, to, the, new, eastern, greek, cities, up, to, two, thirds, of, the, population, emigrated, and, the, macedonian, army, could, only, count, on, a, levy, of, 25, 000, men, a, significantly, smaller, force, than, under, philip, ii, antigonus, ii, ruled, until, his, death, in, 239, bc, his, son, demetrius, ii, soon, died, in, 229, bc, leaving, a, child, philip, v, as, king,

and, the, greek, leagues, the, social, war, of, 220, 217, bc, to, an, end, and, at, this, time, he, controlled, all, of, greece, except, athens, rhodes, and, pergamum, in, 215, bc, philip, with, his, eye, on, illyria, formed, an, alliance, with, rome, s, enemy, hannibal, of, carthage, which, led, to, roman, alliances, with, the, achaean, league, rhodes, and, pergamum, the, first, macedonian, war, broke, out, in, 212, bc, and, ended, inconclusively, in, 205, bc, philip, continued, to, wage, war, against, pergamum, and, rhodes, for, control, of, the, aegean, 204, 200, bc, and, ignored, roman,

antioch, capitals, of, ptolemaic, egypt, and, seleucid, syria, respectively, the, conquests, of, alexander, greatly, widened, the, horizons, of, the, greek, world, making, the, endless, conflicts, between, the, cities, which, had, marked, the, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, seem, petty, and, unimportant, it, led, to, a, steady, emigration, particularly, of, the, young, and, ambitious, to, the, new, greek, empires, in, the, east, many, greeks, migrated, to, alexandria, antioch, and, the, many, other, new, hellenistic, cities, founded, in, alexander, s, wake, as, far, away, as, modern, afghanistan, and, pakistan, independent, city, states, were, unable, to, compete, with, hellenistic, kingdoms, and, were, usually, forced, to, ally, themselves, to, one, of, them, for, defense, giving, honors, to, hellenistic, rulers, in, return, for, protection, one, example, is, athens, which, had, been, decisively, defeated, by, antipater, in, the, lamian, war, 323, 322, bc, and, had, its, port, in, the, piraeus, garrisoned, by, macedonian, troops, who, supported, a, conservative, oligarchy, after, demetrius, poliorcetes, captured, athens, in, 307, bc, and, restored, the,

sellasia, 222, bc, by, the, achaean, league, and, macedon, who, restored, the, power, of, the, ephors, other, city, states, formed, federated, states, in, self, defense, such, as, the, aetolian, league, est, 370, bc, the, achaean, league, est, 280, bc, the, boeotian, league, the, northern, league, byzantium, chalcedon, heraclea, pontica, and, tium, and, the, nesiotic, league, of, the, cyclades, these, federations, involved, a, central, government, which, controlled, foreign, policy, and, military, affairs, while, leaving, most, of, the, local, governing, to, the, city, states, a, system, termed, sympoliteia, in, states, such, as, the, achaean, league, this, also, involved, the, admission, of, other, ethnic, groups, into, the, federation, with, equal, rights, in, this, case,

egyptian, bureaucracy, highly, centralized, and, focused, on, squeezing, as, much, revenue, out, of, the, population, as, possible, through, tariffs, excise, duties, fines, taxes, and, so, forth, a, whole, class, of, petty, officials, tax, farmers, clerks, and, overseers, made, this, possible, the, egyptian, countryside, was, directly, administered, by, this, royal, bureaucracy, external,

babylonia, from, there, he, created, a, new, empire, which, expanded, to, include, much, of, alexander, s, near, eastern, territories, at, the, height, of, its, power, it, included, central, anatolia, the, levant, mesopotamia, persia, today, s, turkmenistan, pamir, and, parts, of, pakistan, it, included, a, diverse, population, estimated, at, fifty, to, sixty, million, people, under, antiochus, i, c, 324, 323, 261, bc, however, the, unwieldy, empire, was, already, beginning, to, shed, territories, pergamum, broke, away, under, eumenes, i, who, defeated, a, seleucid, army, sent, against, him, the, kingdoms, of, cappadocia, bithynia, and, pontus, were, all, practically, independent, by, this, time, as, well, like, the, ptolemies, antiochus, i, established, a, dynastic, religious, cult, deifying, his, father, seleucus, i, seleucus, officially, said, to, be, descended, from, apollo, had, his, own, priests, and, monthly, sacrifices, the, erosion, of, the, empire, continued, under, seleucus, ii, who, was, forced, to, fight, a, civil, war, 239, 236, bc, against, his, brother, antiochus, hierax, and, was, unable, to, keep, bactria, sogdiana, and, parthia, from, breaking, away, hierax, carved, off, most, of, seleucid, anatolia, for, himself, but, was, defeated, along, with, his, galatian, allies, by, attalus, i, of, pergamon, who, now, also, claimed, kingship, the, vast, seleucid, empire, was, like, egypt, mostly, dominated, by, a, greco, macedonian, political, elite, the, greek, population, of, the, cities, who, formed, the, dominant, elite, were, reinforced, by, emigration, from, greece, these, cities, included, newly, founded, colonies, such, as, antioch, the, other, cities, of, the, syrian, tetrapolis, seleucia, north, of, babylon, and, dura, europos, on, the, euphrates, these, cities, retained, traditional, greek, city, state, institutions, such, as, assemblies, councils, and, elected, magistrates, but, this, was, a, facade, for, they, were, always, controlled, by, the, royal, seleucid, officials, apart, from, these, cities, there, were, also, a, large, number, of, seleucid, garrisons, choria, military, colonies, katoikiai, and, greek, villages, komai, which, the, seleucids, planted, throughout, the, empire, to, cement, their, rule, this, greco, macedonian, population, which, also, included, the, sons, of, settlers, who, had, married, local, women, could, make, up, a, phalanx, of, 35, 000, men, out, of, a, total, seleucid, army, of, 80, 000, during, the, reign, of, antiochus, iii, the, rest, of, the, army, was, made, up, of, native, troops, antiochus, iii, the, great, conducted, several, vigorous, campaigns, to, retake, all, the, lost, provinces, of, the, empire, since, the, death, of, seleucus, i, after, being, defeated, by, ptolemy, iv, s, forces, at, raphia, 217, bc, antiochus, iii, led, a, long, campaign, to, the, east, to, subdue, the, far, eastern, breakaway, provinces, 212, 205, bc, including, bactria, parthia, ariana, sogdiana, gedrosia, and, drangiana, he, was, successful, bringing, back, most, of, these, provinces, into, at, least, nominal, vassalage, and, receiving, tribute, from, their, rulers, after, the, death, of, ptolemy, iv, 204, bc, antiochus, took, advantage, of, the, weakness, of, egypt, to, conquer, coele, syria, in, the, fifth, syrian, war, 202, 195, bc, he, then, began, expanding, his, influence, into, pergamene, territory, in, asia, and, crossed, into, europe, fortifying, lysimachia, on, the, hellespont, but, his, expansion, into, anatolia, and, greece, was, abruptly, halted, after, a, decisive, defeat, at, the, battle, of, magnesia, 190, bc, in, the, treaty, of, apamea, which, ended, the, war, antiochus, lost, all, of, his, territories, in, anatolia, west, of, the, taurus, and, was, forced, to, pay, a, large, indemnity, of, 15, 000, talents, much, of, the, eastern, part, of, the, empire, was, then, conquered, by, the, parthians, under, mithridates, i, of, parthia, in, the, mid, 2nd, century, bc, yet, the, seleucid, kings, continued, to, rule, a, rump, state, from, syria, until, the, invasion, by, the, armenian, king, tigranes, the, great, and, their, ultimate, overthrow, by, the, roman, general, pompey, after, the, death, of, lysimachus, one, of, his, officers, philetaerus, took, control, of, the, city, of, pergamum, in, 282, bc, along, with, lysimachus, war, chest, of, 9, 000, talents, and, declared, himself, loyal, to, seleucus, i, while, remaining, de, facto, independent, his, descendant, attalus, i, defeated, the, invading, galatians, and, proclaimed, himself, an, independent, king, attalus, i, 241, 197, bc, was, a, staunch, ally, of, rome, against, philip, v, of, macedon, during, the, first, and, second, macedonian, wars, for, his, support, against, the, seleucids, in, 190, bc, eumenes, ii, was, rewarded, with, all, the, former, seleucid, domains, in, asia, minor, eumenes, ii, turned, pergamon, into, a, centre, of, culture, and, science, by, establishing, the, library, of, pergamum, which, was, said, to, be, second, only, to, the, library, of, alexandria, with, 200, 000, volumes, according, to, plutarch, it, included, a, reading, room, and, a, collection, of, paintings, eumenes, ii, also, constructed, the, pergamum, altar, with, friezes, depicting, the, gigantomachy, on, the, acropolis, of, the, city, pergamum, was, also, a, center, of, parchment, charta, pergamena, production, the, attalids, ruled, pergamon, until, attalus, iii, bequeathed, the, kingdom, of, pergamon, to, the, roman, republic, in, 133, bc, to, avoid, a, likely, succession, crisis, the, celts, who, settled, in, galatia, came, through, thrace, under, the, leadership, of, leotarios, and, leonnorios, c, 270, bc, they, were, defeated, by, seleucus, i, in, the, battle, of, the, elephants, but, were, still, able, to, establish, a, celtic, territory, in, central, anatolia, the, galatians, were, well, respected, as, warriors, and, were, widely, used, as, mercenaries, in, the, armies, of, the, successor, states, they, continued, to, attack, neighboring, kingdoms, such, as, bithynia, and, pergamon, plundering, and, extracting, tribute, this, came, to, an, end, when, they, sided, with, the, renegade, seleucid, prince, antiochus, hierax, who, tried, to, defeat, attalus, the, ruler, of, pergamon, 241, 197, bc, attalus, severely, defeated, the, gauls, forcing, them, to, confine, themselves, to, galatia, the, theme, of, the, dying, gaul, a, famous, statue, displayed, in, pergamon, remained, a, favorite, in, hellenistic, art, for, a, generation, signifying, the, victory, of, the, greeks, over, a, noble, enemy, in, the, early, 2nd, century, bc, the, galatians, became, allies, of, antiochus, the, great, the, last, seleucid,

through, regional, rulers, from, 189, bc, onward, after, their, defeats, by, pergamon, and, rome, the, galatians, slowly, became, hellenized, and, they, were, called, gallo, graeci, by, the,

though, the, nabateans, originally, worshipped, their, traditional, gods, in, symbolic, form, such, as, stone, blocks, or, pillars, during, the, hellenistic, period, they, began, to, identify, their, gods, with, greek, gods, and, depict, them, in, figurative, forms, influenced, by, greek, sculpture, nabatean, art, shows, greek, influences, and, paintings, have, been, found, depicting, dionysian,

after, alexander, s, death, he, was, defeated, by, eumenes, and, crucified, in, 322, bc, but, his, son, ariarathes, ii, managed, to, regain, the, throne, and, maintain, his, autonomy, against, the,

a, war, against, the, seleucids, ariarathes, v, also, waged, war, with, rome, against, aristonicus, a, claimant, to, the, throne, of, pergamon, and, their, forces, were, annihilated, in, 130, bc, this, defeat, allowed, pontus, to, invade, and, conquer, the, kingdom, orontid, armenia, formally, passed, to, the, empire, of, alexander, the, great, following, his, conquest, of, persia, alexander, appointed, an, orontid, named, mithranes, to, govern, armenia, armenia, later, became, a, vassal, state, of, the, seleucid, empire, but, it, maintained, a, considerable, degree, of, autonomy, retaining, its, native, rulers, towards, the, end, 212, bc, the, country, was, divided, into, two, kingdoms, greater, armenia, and, armenia, sophene, including, commagene, or, armenia, minor, the,

the, battle, of, magnesia, in, 190, bc, the, kings, of, sophene, and, greater, armenia, revolted, and, declared, their, independence, with, artaxias, becoming, the, first, king, of, the, artaxiad, dynasty, of, armenia, in, 188, bc, during, the, reign, of, the, artaxiads, armenia, went, through, a, period, of, hellenization, numismatic, evidence, shows, greek, artistic, styles, and, the, use, of, the, greek, language, some, coins, describe, the, armenian, kings, as, philhellenes, during, the, reign, of, tigranes, the, great, 95, 55, bc, the, kingdom, of, armenia, reached, its, greatest, extent, containing, many, greek, cities, including, the, entire, syrian, tetrapolis, cleopatra, the, wife, of, tigranes, the, great, invited, greeks, such, as, the, rhetor, amphicrates, and, the, historian, metrodorus, of, scepsis, to, the, armenian, court, and, according, to, plutarch, when, the, roman, general, lucullus, seized, the, armenian, capital, tigranocerta, he, found, a, troupe, of, greek, actors, who, had, arrived, to, perform, plays, for, tigranes, tigranes, successor, artavasdes, ii, even, composed, greek, tragedies, himself, parthia, was, a, north, eastern, iranian, satrapy, of, the, achaemenid, empire, which, later, passed, on, to, alexander, s, empire, under, the, seleucids, parthia, was, governed, by, various, greek, satraps, such, as, nicanor, and, philip, in, 247, bc, following, the, death, of, antiochus, ii, theos, andragoras, the, seleucid, governor, of, parthia, proclaimed, his, independence, and, began, minting, coins, showing, himself, wearing, a, royal, diadem, and, claiming, kingship, he, ruled, until, 238, bc, when, arsaces, the, leader, of, the, parni, tribe, conquered, parthia, killing, andragoras, and, inaugurating, the, arsacid, dynasty, antiochus, iii, recaptured, arsacid, controlled, territory, in, 209, bc, from, arsaces, ii, arsaces, ii, sued, for, peace, and, became, a, vassal, of, the, seleucids, it, was, not, until, the, reign, of, phraates, i, c, 176, 171, bc, that, the, arsacids, would, again, begin, to, assert, their, independence, during, the, reign, of, mithridates, i, of, parthia, arsacid, control, expanded, to, include, herat, in, 167, bc, babylonia, in, 144, bc, media, in, 141, bc, persia, in, 139, bc, and, large, parts, of, syria, in, the, 110s, bc, the, seleucid, parthian, wars, continued, as, the, seleucids, invaded, mesopotamia, under, antiochus, vii, sidetes, reigned, 138, 129, bc, but, he, was, eventually, killed, by, a, parthian, counterattack, after, the, fall, of, the, seleucid, dynasty, the, parthians, fought, frequently, against, neighbouring, rome, in, the, roman, parthian, wars, 66, bc, ad, 217, abundant, traces, of, hellenism, continued, under, the, parthian, empire, the, parthians, used, greek, as, well, as, their, own, parthian, language, though, lesser, than, greek, as, languages, of, administration, and, also, used, greek, drachmas, as, coinage, they, enjoyed, greek, theater, and, greek, art, influenced, parthian, art, the, parthians, continued, worshipping, greek, gods, syncretized, together, with, iranian, deities, their, rulers, established, ruler, cults, in, the, manner, of, hellenistic, kings, and, often, used, hellenistic, royal, epithets, the, hellenistic, influence, in, iran, was, significant, in, terms, of, scope, but, not, depth, and, durability, unlike, the, near, east, the, iranian, zoroastrian, ideas, and, ideals, remained, the, main, source, of, inspiration, in, mainland, iran, and, was, soon, revived, in, late, parthian, and, sasanian, periods, during, the, hellenistic, period, judea, became, a, frontier, region, between, the, seleucid, empire, and, ptolemaic, egypt, and, therefore, was, often, the, frontline, of, the, syrian, wars, changing, hands, several, times, during, these, conflicts, under, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, judea, was, ruled, by, the, hereditary, office, of, the, high, priest, of, israel, as, a, hellenistic, vassal, this, period, also, saw, the, rise, of, a, hellenistic, judaism, which, first, developed, in, the, jewish, diaspora, of, alexandria, and, antioch, and, then, spread, to, judea, the, major, literary, product, of, this, cultural, syncretism, is, the, septuagint, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, from, biblical, hebrew, and, biblical, aramaic, to, koin, greek, the, reason, for, the, production, of, this, translation, seems, to, be, that, many, of, the, alexandrian, jews, had, lost, the, ability, to, speak, hebrew, and, aramaic, between, 301, and, 219, bc, the, ptolemies, ruled, judea, in, relative, peace, and, jews, often, found, themselves, working, in, the, ptolemaic, administration, and, army, which, led, to, the, rise, of, a, hellenized, jewish, elite, class, e, g, the, tobiads, the, wars, of, antiochus, iii, brought, the, region, into, the, seleucid, empire, jerusalem, fell, to, his, control, in, 198, bc, and, the, temple, was, repaired, and, provided, with, money, and, tribute, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, sacked, jerusalem, and, looted, the, temple, in, 169, bc, after, disturbances, in, judea, during, his, abortive, invasion, of, egypt, antiochus, then, banned, key, jewish, religious, rites, and, traditions, in, judea, he, may, have, been, attempting, to, hellenize, the, region, and, unify, his, empire, and, the, jewish, resistance, to, this, eventually, led, to, an, escalation, of, violence, whatever, the, case, tensions, between, pro, and, anti, seleucid, jewish, factions, led, to, the, 174, 135, bc, maccabean, revolt, of, judas, maccabeus, whose, victory, is, celebrated, in, the, jewish, festival, of, hanukkah, modern, interpretations, see, this, period, as, a, civil, war, between, hellenized, and, orthodox, forms, of, judaism, out, of, this, revolt, was, formed, an, independent, jewish, kingdom, known, as, the, hasmonean, dynasty, which, lasted, from, 165, bc, to, 63, bc, the, hasmonean, dynasty, eventually, disintegrated, in, a, civil, war, which, coincided, with, civil, wars, in, rome, the, last, hasmonean, ruler, antigonus, ii, mattathias, was, captured, by, herod, and, executed, in, 37, bc, in, spite, of, originally, being, a, revolt, against, greek, overlordship, the, hasmonean, kingdom, and, also, the, herodian, kingdom, which, followed, gradually, became, more, and, more, hellenized, from, 37, bc, to, 4, bc, herod, the, great, ruled, as, a, jewish, roman, client, king, appointed, by, the, roman, senate, he, considerably, enlarged, the, temple, see, herod, s, temple, making, it, one, of, the, largest, religious, structures, in, the, world, the, style, of, the, enlarged, temple, and, other, herodian, architecture, shows, significant, hellenistic, architectural, influence, his, son, herod, archelaus, ruled, from, 4, bc, to, ad, 7, when, he, was, deposed, for, the, formation, of, roman, judea, the, kingdom, of, pontus, was, a, hellenistic, kingdom, on, the, southern, coast, of, the, black, sea, it, was, founded, by, mithridates, i, in, 291, bc, and, lasted, until, its, conquest, by, the, roman, republic, in, 63, bc, despite, being, ruled, by, a, dynasty, which, was, a, descendant, of, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, it, became, hellenized, due, to, the, influence, of, the, greek, cities, on, the, black, sea, and, its, neighboring, kingdoms, pontic, culture, was, a, mix, of, greek, and, iranian, elements, the, most, hellenized, parts, of, the, kingdom, were, on, the, coast, populated, by, greek, colonies, such, as, trapezus, and, sinope, the, latter, of, which, became, the, capital, of, the, kingdom, epigraphic, evidence, also, shows, extensive, hellenistic, influence, in, the, interior, during, the, reign, of, mithridates, ii, pontus, was, allied, with, the, seleucids, through, dynastic, marriages, by, the, time, of, mithridates, vi, eupator, greek, was, the, official, language, of, the, kingdom, though, anatolian, languages, continued, to, be, spoken, the, kingdom, grew, to, its, largest, extent, under, mithridates, vi, who, conquered, colchis, cappadocia, paphlagonia, bithynia, lesser, armenia, the, bosporan, kingdom, the, greek, colonies, of, the, tauric, chersonesos, and, for, a, brief, time, the, roman, province, of, asia, mithridates, himself, of, mixed, persian, and, greek, ancestry, presented, himself, as, the, protector, of, the, greeks, against, the, barbarians, of, rome, styling, himself, as, king, mithridates, eupator, dionysus, and, as, the, great, liberator, mithridates, also, depicted, himself, with, the, anastole, hairstyle, of, alexander, and, used, the, symbolism, of, herakles, from, whom, the, macedonian, kings, claimed, descent, after, a, long, struggle, with, rome, in, the, mithridatic, wars, pontus, was, defeated, part, of, it, was, incorporated, into, the, roman, republic, as, the, province, of, bithynia, while, pontus, eastern, half, survived, as, a, client, kingdom, the, greek, kingdom, of, bactria, began, as, a, breakaway, satrapy, of, the, seleucid, empire, which, because, of, the, size, of, the, empire, had, significant, freedom, from, central, control, between, 255, and, 246, bc, the, governor, of, bactria, sogdiana, and, margiana, most, of, present, day, afghanistan, one, diodotus, took, this, process, to, its, logical, extreme, and, declared, himself, king, diodotus, ii, son, of, diodotus, was, overthrown, in, about, 230, bc, by, euthydemus, possibly, the, satrap, of, sogdiana, who, then, started, his, own, dynasty, in, c, 210, bc, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, was, invaded, by, a, resurgent, seleucid, empire, under, antiochus, iii, the, great, while, victorious, in, the, field, it, seems, antiochus, came, to, realise, that, there, were, advantages, in, the, status, quo, perhaps, sensing, that, bactria, could, not, be, governed, from, syria, and, married, one, of, his, daughters, to, euthydemus, s, son, thus, legitimizing, the, greco, bactrian, dynasty, soon, afterwards, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, seems, to, have, expanded, possibly, taking, advantage, of, the, defeat, of, the, parthian, king, arsaces, ii, by, antiochus, according, to, strabo, the, greco, bactrians, seem, to, have, had, contacts, with, han, china, through, the, silk, road, trade, routes, strabo, xi, 11, 1, there, is, evidence, of, technology, exchange, between, bactria, and, china, around, this, time, in, the, form, of, metal, alloys, such, as, copper, nickel, which, was, then, unknown, to, the, west, indian, sources, also, maintain, religious, contact, between, buddhist, monks, and, the, greeks, and, some, greco, bactrians, did, convert, to, buddhism, demetrius, son, and, successor, of, euthydemus, invaded, north, western, india, around, 180, bc, after, the, destruction, of, the, mauryan, empire, there, the, mauryans, were, probably, allies, of, the, bactrians, and, seleucids, the, exact, justification, for, the, invasion, remains, unclear, but, after, 180, bc, the, greeks, ruled, over, parts, of, northwestern, india, this, period, also, marks, the, beginning, of, the, obfuscation, of, greco, bactrian, history, demetrius, possibly, died, in, about, 180, bc, numismatic, evidence, suggests, the, existence, of, several, other, kings, shortly, thereafter, it, is, probable, that, at, this, point, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, split, into, several, semi, independent, regions, for, some, years, often, warring, amongst, themselves, king, heliocles, was, the, last, greek, to, clearly, rule, bactria, his, power, collapsing, in, the, face, of, central, asian, tribal, invasions, scythian, and, yuezhi, by, about, 130, bc, however, greek, urban, civilisation, seems, to, have, continued, in, bactria, after, the, fall, of, the, kingdom, having, a, hellenising, effect, on, the, tribes, which, had, displaced, greek, rule, the, kushan, empire, which, followed, continued, to, use, greek, on, their, coinage, and, greeks, continued, being, influential, in, the, empire, the, separation, of, the, indo, greek, kingdom, from, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, resulted, in, an, even, more, isolated, position, and, thus, the, details, of, the, indo, greek, kingdom, are, even, more, obscure, than, for, bactria, many, supposed, kings, in, india, are, known, only, because, of, coins, bearing, their, name, the, numismatic, evidence, together, with, archaeological, finds, and, the, scant, historical, records, suggest, that, the, fusion, of, eastern, and, western, cultures, reached, its, peak, in, the, indo, greek, kingdom, after, demetrius, death, civil, wars, between, bactrian, kings, in, india, allowed, apollodotus, i, from, c, 180, 175, bc, to, make, himself, independent, as, the, first, proper, indo, greek, king, who, did, not, rule, from, bactria, large, numbers, of, his, coins, have, been, found, in, india, and, he, seems, to, have, reigned, in, gandhara, as, well, as, western, punjab, apollodotus, i, was, succeeded, by, or, ruled, alongside, antimachus, ii, likely, the, son, of, the, bactrian, king, antimachus, i, in, about, 155, or, 165, bc, he, seems, to, have, been, succeeded, by, the, most, successful, of, the, indo, greek, kings, menander, i, menander, converted, to, buddhism, and, seems, to, have, been, a, great, patron, of, the, religion, he, is, remembered, in, some, buddhist, texts, as, milinda, he, also, expanded, the, kingdom, further, east, into, punjab, though, these, conquests, were, rather, ephemeral, after, the, death, of, menander, c, 130, bc, the, kingdom, appears, to, have, fragmented, with, several, kings, attested, contemporaneously, in, different, regions, this, inevitably, weakened, the, greek, position, and, territory, seems, to, have, been, lost, progressively, around, 70, bc, the, western, regions, of, arachosia, and, paropamisadae, were, lost, to, tribal, invasions, presumably, by, those, tribes, responsible, for, the, end, of, the, bactrian, kingdom, the, resulting, indo, scythian, kingdom, seems, to, have, gradually, pushed, the, remaining, indo, greek, kingdom, towards, the, east, the, indo, greek, kingdom, appears, to, have, lingered, on, in, western, punjab, until, about, ad, 10, at, which, time, it, was, finally, ended, by, the, indo, scythians, strato, iii, was, the, last, of, the, dynasty, of, diodotus, was, the, last, of, the, line, of, diodotus, and, independent, hellenistic, king, to, rule, at, his, death, in, 10, ad, after, conquering, the, indo, greeks, the, kushan, empire, took, over, greco, buddhism, the, greek, language, greek, script, greek, coinage, and, artistic, styles, greeks, continued, being, an, important, part, of, the, cultural, world, of, india, for, generations, the, depictions, of, the, buddha, appear, to, have, been, influenced, by, greek, culture, buddha, representations, in, the, ghandara, period, often, showed, buddha, under, the, protection, of, herakles, several, references, in, indian, literature, praise, the, knowledge, of, the, yavanas, or, the, greeks, the, mahabharata, compliments, them, as, the, all, knowing, yavanas, sarvaj, yavan, e, g, the, yavanas, o, king, are, all, knowing, the, suras, are, particularly, so, the, mlecchas, are, wedded, to, the, creations, of, their, own, fancy, such, as, flying, machines, that, are, generally, called, vimanas, the, brihat, samhita, of, the, mathematician, varahamihira, says, the, greeks, though, impure, must, be, honored, since, they, were, trained, in, sciences, and, therein, excelled, others, widespread, roman, interference, in, the, greek, world, was, probably, inevitable, given, the, general, manner, of, the, ascendancy, of, the, roman, republic, this, roman, greek, interaction, began, as, a, consequence, of, the, greek, city, states, located, along, the, coast, of, southern, italy, rome, had, come, to, dominate, the, italian, peninsula, and, desired, the, submission, of, the, greek, cities, to, its, rule, although, they, initially, resisted, allying, themselves, with, pyrrhus, of, epirus, and, defeating, the, romans, at, several, battles, the, greek, cities, were, unable, to, maintain, this, position, and, were, absorbed, by, the, roman, republic, shortly, afterward, rome, became, involved, in, sicily, fighting, against, the, carthaginians, in, the, first, punic, war, the, result, was, the, complete, conquest, of, sicily, including, its, previously, powerful, greek, cities, by, the, romans, after, the, second, punic, war, the, romans, looked, to, re, assert, their, influence, in, the, balkans, and, to, curb, the, expansion, of, philip, v, of, macedon, a, pretext, for, war, was, provided, by, philip, s, refusal, to, end, his, war, with, attalid, pergamum, and, rhodes, both, roman, allies, the, romans, also, allied, with, the, aetolian, league, of, greek, city, states, which, resented, philip, s, power, thus, declared, war, on, macedon, in, 200, bc, starting, the, second, macedonian, war, this, ended, with, a, decisive, roman, victory, at, the, battle, of, cynoscephalae, 197, bc, like, most, roman, peace, treaties, of, the, period, the, resultant, peace, of, flaminius, was, designed, utterly, to, crush, the, power, of, the, defeated, party, a, massive, indemnity, was, levied, philip, s, fleet, was, surrendered, to, rome, and, macedon, was, effectively, returned, to, its, ancient, boundaries, losing, influence, over, the, city, states, of, southern, greece, and, land, in, thrace, and, asia, minor, the, result, was, the, end, of, macedon, as, a, major, power, in, the, mediterranean, in, less, than, twenty, years, rome, had, destroyed, the, power, of, one, of, the, successor, states, crippled, another, and, firmly, entrenched, its, influence, over, greece, this, was, primarily, a, result, of, the, over, ambition, of, the, macedonian, kings, and, their, unintended, provocation, of, rome, though, rome, was, quick, to, exploit, the, situation, in, another, twenty, years, the, macedonian, kingdom, was, no, more, seeking, to, re, assert, macedonian, power, and, greek, independence, philip, v, s, son, perseus, incurred, the, wrath, of, the, romans, resulting, in, the, third, macedonian, war, 171, 168, bc, victorious, the, romans, abolished, the, macedonian, kingdom, replacing, it, with, four, puppet, republics, until, it, was, formally, annexed, as, a, roman, province, after, yet, another, rebellion, under, andriscus, rome, now, demanded, that, the, achaean, league, the, last, stronghold, of, greek, independence, be, dissolved, the, achaeans, refused, and, declared, war, on, rome, most, of, the, greek, cities, rallied, to, the, achaeans, side, even, slaves, were, freed, to, fight, for, greek, independence, the, roman, consul, lucius, mummius, advanced, from, macedonia, and, defeated, the, greeks, at, corinth, which, was, razed, to, the, ground, in, 146, bc, the, greek, peninsula, though, not, the, islands, became, a, roman, protectorate, roman, taxes, were, imposed, except, in, athens, and, sparta, and, all, the, cities, had, to, accept, rule, by, rome, s, local, allies, the, attalid, dynasty, of, pergamum, lasted, little, longer, a, roman, ally, until, the, end, its, final, king, attalus, iii, died, in, 133, bc, without, an, heir, and, taking, the, alliance, to, its, natural, conclusion, willed, pergamum, to, the, roman, republic, the, final, greek, resistance, came, in, 88, bc, when, king, mithridates, of, pontus, rebelled, against, rome, captured, roman, held, anatolia, and, massacred, up, to, 100, 000, romans, and, roman, allies, across, asia, minor, many, greek, cities, including, athens, overthrew, their, roman, puppet, rulers, and, joined, him, in, the, mithridatic, wars, when, he, was, driven, out, of, greece, by, the, roman, general, lucius, cornelius, sulla, the, latter, laid, siege, to, athens, and, razed, the, city, mithridates, was, finally, defeated, by, gnaeus, pompeius, magnus, pompey, the, great, in, 65, bc, further, ruin, was, brought, to, greece, by, the, roman, civil, wars, which, were, partly, fought, in, greece, finally, in, 27, bc, augustus, directly, annexed, greece, to, the, new, roman, empire, as, the, province, of, achaea, the, struggles, with, rome, had, left, greece, depopulated, and, demoralised, nevertheless, roman, rule, at, least, brought, an, end, to, warfare, and, cities, such, as, athens, corinth, thessaloniki, and, patras, soon, recovered, their, prosperity, eventually, instability, in, the, near, east, resulting, from, the, power, vacuum, left, by, the, collapse, of, the, seleucid, empire, caused, the, roman, proconsul, pompey, the, great, to, abolish, the, seleucid, rump, state, absorbing, much, of, syria, into, the, roman, republic, famously, the, end, of, ptolemaic, egypt, came, as, the, final, act, in, the, republican, civil, war, between, the, roman, triumvirs, mark, anthony, and, augustus, caesar, after, the, defeat, of, anthony, and, his, lover, the, last, ptolemaic, monarch, cleopatra, vii, at, the, battle, of, actium, augustus, invaded, egypt, and, took, it, as, his, own, personal, fiefdom, he, thereby, completed, the, destruction, of, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, and, transformed, the, roman, republic, into, a, monarchy, ending, in, hindsight, the, hellenistic, era, greek, culture, was, at, its, height, of, world, influence, in, the, hellenistic, period, hellenism, or, at, least, philhellenism, reached, most, regions, on, the, frontiers, of, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, though, some, of, these, regions, were, not, ruled, by, greeks, or, even, greek, speaking, elites, hellenistic, influence, can, be, seen, in, the, historical, record, and, material, culture, of, these, regions, other, regions, had, established, contact, with, greek, colonies, before, this, period, and, simply, saw, a, continued, process, of, hellenization, and, intermixing, the, spread, of, greek, culture, and, language, throughout, the, near, east, and, asia, owed, much, to, the, development, of, newly, founded, cities, and, deliberate, colonization, policies, by, the, successor, states, which, in, turn, was, necessary, for, maintaining, their, military, forces, settlements, such, as, ai, khanoum, on, trade, routes, allowed, greek, culture, to, mix, and, spread, the, language, of, philip, ii, s, and, alexander, s, court, and, army, which, was, made, up, of, various, greek, and, non, greek, speaking, peoples, was, a, version, of, attic, greek, and, over, time, this, language, developed, into, koine, the, lingua, franca, of, the, successor, states, the, spread, of, greek, influence, and, language, is, also, shown, through, ancient, greek, coinage, portraits, became, more, realistic, and, the, obverse, of, the, coin, was, often, used, to, display, a, propagandistic, image, commemorating, an, event, or, displaying, the, image, of, a, favored, god, the, use, of, greek, style, portraits, and, greek, language, continued, under, the, roman, parthian, and, kushan, empires, even, as, the, use, of, greek, was, in, decline, in, some, fields, hellenistic, culture, thrived, particularly, in, its, preservation, of, the, past, the, states, of, the, hellenistic, period, were, deeply, fixated, with, the, past, and, its, seemingly, lost, glories, the, preservation, of, many, classical, and, archaic, works, of, art, and, literature, including, the, works, of, the, three, great, classical, tragedians, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, are, due, to, the, efforts, of, the, hellenistic, greeks, the, museum, and, library, of, alexandria, was, the, center, of, this, conservationist, activity, with, the, support, of, royal, stipends, alexandrian, scholars, collected, translated, copied, classified, and, critiqued, every, book, they, could, find, most, of, the, great, literary, figures, of, the, hellenistic, period, studied, at, alexandria, and, conducted, research, there, they, were, scholar, poets, writing, not, only, poetry, but, treatises, on, homer, and, other, archaic, and, classical, greek, literature, athens, retained, its, position, as, the, most, prestigious, seat, of, higher, education, especially, in, the, domains, of, philosophy, and, rhetoric, with, considerable, libraries, and, philosophical, schools, alexandria, had, the, monumental, museum, a, research, center, and, library, of, alexandria, which, was, estimated, to, have, had, 700, 000, volumes, the, city, of, pergamon, also, had, a, large, library, and, became, a, major, center, of, book, production, the, island, of, rhodes, had, a, library, and, also, boasted, a, famous, finishing, school, for, politics, and, diplomacy, libraries, were, also, present, in, antioch, pella, and, kos, cicero, was, educated, in, athens, and, mark, antony, in, rhodes, antioch, was, founded, as, a, metropolis, and, center, of, greek, learning, which, retained, its, status, into, the, era, of, christianity, seleucia, replaced, babylon, as, the, metropolis, of, the, lower, tigris, the, identification, of, local, gods, with, similar, greek, deities, a, practice, termed, interpretatio, graeca, stimulated, the, building, of, greek, style, temples, and, greek, culture, in, the, cities, meant, that, buildings, such, as, gymnasia, and, theaters, became, common, many, cities, maintained, nominal, autonomy, while, under, the, rule, of, the, local, king, or, satrap, and, often, had, greek, style, institutions, greek, dedications, statues, architecture, and, inscriptions, have, all, been, found, however, local, cultures, were, not, replaced, and, mostly, went, on, as, before, but, now, with, a, new, greco, macedonian, or, otherwise, hellenized, elite, an, example, that, shows, the, spread, of, greek, theater, is, plutarch, s, story, of, the, death, of, crassus, in, which, his, head, was, taken, to, the, parthian, court, and, used, as, a, prop, in, a, performance, of, the, bacchae, theaters, have, also, been, found, for, example, in, ai, khanoum, on, the, edge, of, bactria, the, theater, has, 35, rows, larger, than, the, theater, in, babylon, the, concept, of, hellenization, meaning, the, adoption, of, greek, culture, in, non, greek, regions, has, long, been, controversial, undoubtedly, greek, influence, did, spread, through, the, hellenistic, realms, but, to, what, extent, and, whether, this, was, a, deliberate, policy, or, mere, cultural, diffusion, have, been, hotly, debated, it, seems, likely, that, alexander, himself, pursued, policies, which, led, to, hellenization, such, as, the, foundations, of, new, cities, and, greek, colonies, while, it, may, have, been, a, deliberate, attempt, to, spread, greek, culture, or, as, arrian, says, to, civilise, the, natives, it, is, more, likely, that, it, was, a, series, of, pragmatic, measures, designed, to, aid, in, the, rule, of, his, enormous, empire, cities, and, colonies, were, centers, of, administrative, control, and, macedonian, power, in, a, newly, conquered, region, alexander, also, seems, to, have, attempted, to, create, a, mixed, greco, persian, elite, class, as, shown, by, the, susa, weddings, and, his, adoption, of, some, forms, of, persian, dress, and, court, culture, he, also, brought, persian, and, other, non, greek, peoples, into, his, military, and, even, the, elite, cavalry, units, of, the, companion, cavalry, again, it, is, probably, better, to, see, these, policies, as, a, pragmatic, response, to, the, demands, of, ruling, a, large, empire, than, to, any, idealized, attempt, to, bringing, greek, culture, to, the, barbarians, this, approach, was, bitterly, resented, by, the, macedonians, and, discarded, by, most, of, the, diadochi, after, alexander, s, death, these, policies, can, also, be, interpreted, as, the, result, of, alexander, s, possible, megalomania, during, his, later, years, after, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, the, influx, of, greek, colonists, into, the, new, realms, continued, to, spread, greek, culture, into, asia, the, founding, of, new, cities, and, military, colonies, continued, to, be, a, major, part, of, the, successors, struggle, for, control, of, any, particular, region, and, these, continued, to, be, centers, of, cultural, diffusion, the, spread, of, greek, culture, under, the, successors, seems, mostly, to, have, occurred, with, the, spreading, of, greeks, themselves, rather, than, as, an, active, policy, throughout, the, hellenistic, world, these, greco, macedonian, colonists, considered, themselves, by, and, large, superior, to, the, native, barbarians, and, excluded, most, non, greeks, from, the, upper, echelons, of, courtly, and, government, life, most, of, the, native, population, was, not, hellenized, had, little, access, to, greek, culture, and, often, found, themselves, discriminated, against, by, their, hellenic, overlords, gymnasiums, and, their, greek, education, for, example, were, for, greeks, only, greek, cities, and, colonies, may, have, exported, greek, art, and, architecture, as, far, as, the, indus, but, these, were, mostly, enclaves, of, greek, culture, for, the, transplanted, greek, elite, the, degree, of, influence, that, greek, culture, had, throughout, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, was, therefore, highly, localized, and, based, mostly, on, a, few, great, cities, like, alexandria, and, antioch, some, natives, did, learn, greek, and, adopt, greek, ways, but, this, was, mostly, limited, to, a, few, local, elites, who, were, allowed, to, retain, their, posts, by, the, diadochi, and, also, to, a, small, number, of, mid, level, administrators, who, acted, as, intermediaries, between, the, greek, speaking, upper, class, and, their, subjects, in, the, seleucid, empire, for, example, this, group, amounted, to, only, 2, 5, percent, of, the, official, class, hellenistic, art, nevertheless, had, a, considerable, influence, on, the, cultures, that, had, been, affected, by, the, hellenistic, expansion, as, far, as, the, indian, subcontinent, hellenistic, influence, on, indian, art, was, broad, and, far, reaching, and, had, effects, for, several, centuries, following, the, forays, of, alexander, the, great, despite, their, initial, reluctance, the, successors, seem, to, have, later, deliberately, naturalized, themselves, to, their, different, regions, presumably, in, order, to, help, maintain, control, of, the, population, in, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, we, find, some, egyptianized, greeks, by, the, 2nd, century, onwards, in, the, indo, greek, kingdom, we, find, kings, who, were, converts, to, buddhism, e, g, menander, the, greeks, in, the, regions, therefore, gradually, become, localized, adopting, local, customs, as, appropriate, in, this, way, hybrid, hellenistic, cultures, naturally, emerged, at, least, among, the, upper, echelons, of, society, the, trends, of, hellenization, were, therefore, accompanied, by, greeks, adopting, native, ways, over, time, but, this, was, widely, varied, by, place, and, by, social, class, the, farther, away, from, the, mediterranean, and, the, lower, in, social, status, the, more, likely, that, a, colonist, was, to, adopt, local, ways, while, the, greco, macedonian, elites, and, royal, families, usually, remained, thoroughly, greek, and, viewed, most, non, greeks, with, disdain, it, was, not, until, cleopatra, vii, that, a, ptolemaic, ruler, bothered, to, learn, the, egyptian, language, of, their, subjects, in, the, hellenistic, period, there, was, much, continuity, in, greek, religion, the, greek, gods, continued, to, be, worshiped, and, the, same, rites, were, practiced, as, before, however, the, socio, political, changes, brought, on, by, the, conquest, of, the, persian, empire, and, greek, emigration, abroad, meant, that, change, also, came, to, religious, practices, this, varied, greatly, by, location, athens, sparta, and, most, cities, in, the, greek, mainland, did, not, see, much, religious, change, or, new, gods, with, the, exception, of, the, egyptian, isis, in, athens, while, the, multi, ethnic, alexandria, had, a, very, varied, group, of, gods, and, religious, practices, including, egyptian, jewish, and, greek, greek, emigres, brought, their, greek, religion, everywhere, they, went, even, as, far, as, india, and, afghanistan, non, greeks, also, had, more, freedom, to, travel, and, trade, throughout, the, mediterranean, and, in, this, period, we, can, see, egyptian, gods, such, as, serapis, and, the, syrian, gods, atargatis, and, hadad, as, well, as, a, jewish, synagogue, all, coexisting, on, the, island, of, delos, alongside, classical, greek, deities, a, common, practice, was, to, identify, greek, gods, with, native, gods, that, had, similar, characteristics, and, this, created, new, fusions, like, zeus, ammon, aphrodite, hagne, a, hellenized, atargatis, and, isis, demeter, greek, emigres, faced, individual, religious, choices, they, had, not, faced, on, their, home, cities, where, the, gods, they, worshiped, were, dictated, by, tradition, hellenistic, monarchies, were, closely, associated, with, the, religious, life, of, the, kingdoms, they, ruled, this, had, already, been, a, feature, of, macedonian, kingship, which, had, priestly, duties, hellenistic, kings, adopted, patron, deities, as, protectors, of, their, house, and, sometimes, claimed, descent, from, them, the, seleucids, for, example, took, on, apollo, as, patron, the, antigonids, had, herakles, and, the, ptolemies, claimed, dionysus, among, others, the, worship, of, dynastic, ruler, cults, was, also, a, feature, of, this, period, most, notably, in, egypt, where, the, ptolemies, adopted, earlier, pharaonic, practice, and, established, themselves, as, god, kings, these, cults, were, usually, associated, with, a, specific, temple, in, honor, of, the, ruler, such, as, the, ptolemaieia, at, alexandria, and, had, their, own, festivals, and, theatrical, performances, the, setting, up, of, ruler, cults, was, more, based, on, the, systematized, honors, offered, to, the, kings, sacrifice, proskynesis, statues, altars, hymns, which, put, them, on, par, with, the, gods, isotheism, than, on, actual, belief, of, their, divine, nature, according, to, peter, green, these, cults, did, not, produce, genuine, belief, of, the, divinity, of, rulers, among, the, greeks, and, macedonians, the, worship, of, alexander, was, also, popular, as, in, the, long, lived, cult, at, erythrae, and, of, course, at, alexandria, where, his, tomb, was, located, the, hellenistic, age, also, saw, a, rise, in, the, disillusionment, with, traditional, religion, the, rise, of, philosophy, and, the, sciences, had, removed, the, gods, from, many, of, their, traditional, domains, such, as, their, role, in, the, movement, of, the, heavenly, bodies, and, natural, disasters, the, sophists, proclaimed, the, centrality, of, humanity, and, agnosticism, the, belief, in, euhemerism, the, view, that, the, gods, were, simply, ancient, kings, and, heroes, became, popular, the, popular, philosopher, epicurus, promoted, a, view, of, disinterested, gods, living, far, away, from, the, human, realm, in, metakosmia, the, apotheosis, of, rulers, also, brought, the, idea, of, divinity, down, to, earth, while, there, does, seem, to, have, been, a, substantial, decline, in, religiosity, this, was, mostly, reserved, for, the, educated, classes, magic, was, practiced, widely, and, this, too, was, a, continuation, from, earlier, times, throughout, the, hellenistic, world, people, would, consult, oracles, and, use, charms, and, figurines, to, deter, misfortune, or, to, cast, spells, also, developed, in, this, era, was, the, complex, system, of, astrology, which, sought, to, determine, a, person, s, character, and, future, in, the, movements, of, the, sun, moon, and, planets, astrology, was, widely, associated, with, the, cult, of, tyche, luck, fortune, which, grew, in, popularity, during, this, period, the, hellenistic, period, saw, the, rise, of, new, comedy, the, only, few, surviving, representative, texts, being, those, of, menander, born, 342, 341, bc, only, one, play, dyskolos, survives, in, its, entirety, the, plots, of, this, new, hellenistic, comedy, of, manners, were, more, domestic, and, formulaic, stereotypical, low, born, characters, such, as, slaves, became, more, important, the, language, was, colloquial, and, major, motifs, included, escapism, marriage, romance, and, luck, tyche, though, no, hellenistic, tragedy, remains, intact, they, were, still, widely, produced, during, the, period, yet, it, seems, that, there, was, no, major, breakthrough, in, style, remaining, within, the, classical, model, the, supplementum, hellenisticum, a, modern, collection, of, extant, fragments, contains, the, fragments, of, 150, authors, hellenistic, poets, now, sought, patronage, from, kings, and, wrote, works, in, their, honor, the, scholars, at, the, libraries, in, alexandria, and, pergamon, focused, on, the, collection, cataloging, and, literary, criticism, of, classical, athenian, works, and, ancient, greek, myths, the, poet, critic, callimachus, a, staunch, elitist, wrote, hymns, equating, ptolemy, ii, to, zeus, and, apollo, he, promoted, short, poetic, forms, such, as, the, epigram, epyllion, and, the, iambic, and, attacked, epic, as, base, and, common, big, book, big, evil, was, his, doctrine, he, also, wrote, a, massive, catalog, of, the, holdings, of, the, library, of, alexandria, the, famous, pinakes, callimachus, was, extremely, influential, in, his, time, and, also, for, the, development, of, augustan, poetry, another, poet, apollonius, of, rhodes, attempted, to, revive, the, epic, for, the, hellenistic, world, with, his, argonautica, he, had, been, a, student, of, callimachus, and, later, became, chief, librarian, prostates, of, the, library, of, alexandria, apollonius, and, callimachus, spent, much, of, their, careers, feuding, with, each, other, pastoral, poetry, also, thrived, during, the, hellenistic, era, theocritus, was, a, major, poet, who, popularized, the, genre, around, 240, bc, livius, andronicus, a, greek, slave, from, southern, italy, translated, homer, s, odyssey, into, latin, greek, literature, would, have, a, dominant, effect, on, the, development, of, the, latin, literature, of, the, romans, the, poetry, of, virgil, horace, and, ovid, were, all, based, on, hellenistic, styles, during, the, hellenistic, period, many, different, schools, of, thought, developed, and, these, schools, of, hellenistic, philosophy, had, a, significant, influence, on, the, greek, and, roman, ruling, elite, athens, with, its, multiple, philosophical, schools, continued, to, remain, the, center, of, philosophical, thought, however, athens, had, now, lost, her, political, freedom, and, hellenistic, philosophy, is, a, reflection, of, this, new, difficult, period, in, this, political, climate, hellenistic, philosophers, went, in, search, of, goals, such, as, ataraxia, un, disturbedness, autarky, self, sufficiency, and, apatheia, freedom, from, suffering, which, would, allow, them, to, wrest, well, being, or, eudaimonia, out, of, the, most, difficult, turns, of, fortune, this, occupation, with, the, inner, life, with, personal, inner, liberty, and, with, the, pursuit, of, eudaimonia, is, what, all, hellenistic, philosophical, schools, have, in, common, the, epicureans, and, the, cynics, eschewed, public, offices, and, civic, service, which, amounted, to, a, rejection, of, the, polis, itself, the, defining, institution, of, the, greek, world, epicurus, promoted, atomism, and, an, asceticism, based, on, freedom, from, pain, as, its, ultimate, goal, the, cyrenaics, and, epicureans, embraced, hedonism, arguing, that, pleasure, was, the, only, true, good, cynics, such, as, diogenes, of, sinope, rejected, all, material, possessions, and, social, conventions, nomos, as, unnatural, and, useless, stoicism, founded, by, zeno, of, citium, taught, that, virtue, was, sufficient, for, eudaimonia, as, it, would, allow, one, to, live, in, accordance, with, nature, or, logos, the, philosophical, schools, of, aristotle, the, peripatetics, of, the, lyceum, and, plato, platonism, at, the, academy, also, remained, influential, against, these, dogmatic, schools, of, philosophy, the, pyrrhonist, school, embraced, philosophical, skepticism, and, starting, with, arcesilaus, plato, s, academy, also, embraced, skepticism, in, the, form, of, academic, skepticism, the, spread, of, christianity, throughout, the, roman, world, followed, by, the, spread, of, islam, ushered, in, the, end, of, hellenistic, philosophy, and, the, beginnings, of, medieval, philosophy, often, forcefully, as, under, justinian, i, which, was, dominated, by, the, three, abrahamic, traditions, jewish, philosophy, christian, philosophy, and, early, islamic, philosophy, in, spite, of, this, shift, hellenistic, philosophy, continued, to, influence, these, three, religious, traditions, and, the, renaissance, thought, which, followed, them, science, in, the, hellenistic, age, differed, from, that, of, the, previous, era, in, at, least, two, ways, first, it, benefited, from, the, cross, fertilization, of, greek, ideas, with, those, that, had, developed, in, older, civilizations, secondly, to, some, extent, it, was, supported, by, royal, patrons, in, the, kingdoms, founded, by, alexander, s, successors, the, cultural, competition, among, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, produced, seats, of, learning, throughout, the, mediterranean, of, which, the, most, important, was, alexandria, in, egypt, which, became, a, major, center, of, scholarship, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, in, their, scientific, investigations, hellenistic, scholars, frequently, employed, the, principles, developed, earlier, in, ancient, greece, the, application, of, mathematics, to, natural, phenomena, and, the, undertaking, of, deliberate, empirical, research, in, mathematics, hellenistic, geometers, built, upon, the, work, of, mathematicians, from, the, previous, generation, such, as, theodorus, archytas, theaetetus, and, eudoxus, euclid, whose, elements, became, the, most, important, textbook, in, western, mathematics, until, the, 19th, century, presented, proofs, for, the, pythagorean, theorem, for, the, infinitude, of, primes, and, for, the, five, platonic, solids, archimedes, made, use, of, a, technique, dependent, on, proof, by, contradiction, to, solve, problems, with, an, arbitrary, degree, of, accuracy, known, as, the, method, of, exhaustion, archimedes, used, it, in, several, of, his, works, including, to, approximate, the, value, of, measurement, of, the, circle, and, to, prove, that, the, area, enclosed, by, a, parabola, and, a, straight, line, is, 4, 3, times, the, area, of, a, triangle, with, equal, base, and, height, quadrature, of, the, parabola, the, most, characteristic, product, of, hellenistic, mathematics, was, the, theory, of, conic, sections, reaching, its, greatest, achievement, in, the, work, of, apollonius, it, made, no, explicit, use, of, either, algebra, or, trigonometry, the, latter, appearing, around, the, time, of, hipparchus, in, the, exact, sciences, eratosthenes, measured, the, earth, s, circumference, and, calculated, the, tilt, of, the, earth, s, axis, with, remarkable, accuracy, he, might, have, also, determined, the, distance, from, the, earth, to, the, sun, and, invented, the, leap, day, eratosthenes, drew, a, map, of, the, world, incorporating, parallels, and, meridians, based, on, the, available, geographical, knowledge, of, the, era, another, important, figure, is, the, astronomer, hipparchus, who, used, babylonian, astronomical, data, and, discovered, the, phenomena, of, earth, s, precession, pliny, reports, that, hipparchus, produced, the, first, systematic, star, catalog, after, he, observed, a, new, star, wishing, to, preserve, astronomical, record, of, the, stars, so, that, new, ones, could, be, discovered, a, celestial, globe, based, on, hipparchus, star, catalog, presumably, sits, atop, the, broad, shoulders, of, a, large, 2nd, century, roman, statue, known, as, the, farnese, atlas, another, astronomer, aristarchos, of, samos, measured, the, distances, of, the, earth, sun, and, moon, and, developed, a, heliocentric, theory, in, mechanics, ctesibius, wrote, the, first, treatises, on, the, science, of, compressed, air, and, its, uses, in, pumps, and, allegedly, designed, a, kind, of, cannon, as, reported, by, hero, of, alexandria, in, the, life, sciences, medicine, made, significant, advances, within, the, framework, of, the, hippocratic, tradition, praxagoras, theorized, that, blood, traveled, through, the, veins, while, herophilos, and, erasistratus, performed, dissections, and, vivisections, of, humans, and, animals, providing, accurate, descriptions, of, the, nervous, system, liver, and, other, key, organs, influenced, by, philinus, of, cos, a, student, of, herophilos, the, empiric, school, of, medicine, focused, on, strict, observation, and, rejected, the, unseen, causes, of, the, dogmatic, school, in, botany, theophrastus, was, known, for, his, work, in, plant, classification, while, crateuas, wrote, a, compendium, on, botanic, pharmacy, the, library, of, alexandria, presumably, included, a, zoo, for, research, and, hellenistic, zoologists, include, archelaos, leonidas, of, byzantion, apollodoros, of, alexandria, and, bion, of, soloi, the, technological, achievement, of, the, hellenistic, age, is, masterly, displayed, in, the, antikythera, mechanism, a, 37, gear, mechanical, analog, computer, which, calculated, the, motions, of, the, sun, moon, and, planets, including, lunar, and, solar, eclipses, devices, of, this, sort, are, not, found, again, until, the, 10th, century, when, a, simpler, eight, geared, luni, solar, calculator, incorporated, into, an, astrolabe, was, described, by, the, persian, scholar, al, biruni, similarly, complex, devices, were, also, developed, by, other, muslim, engineers, and, astronomers, during, the, middle, ages, other, technological, developments, of, the, hellenistic, age, include, cogged, gears, pulleys, archimedes, screw, the, screw, press, glassblowing, hollow, bronze, casting, surveying, instruments, the, odometer, the, pantograph, the, water, clock, the, watermill, the, water, organ, and, the, piston, pump, past, interpretations, of, hellenistic, science, often, downplayed, its, significance, as, found, for, instance, in, the, english, classical, scholar, francis, cornford, who, believed, that, all, the, most, important, and, original, work, was, done, in, the, three, centuries, from, 600, to, 300, bc, recent, interpretations, tend, to, be, more, generous, leading, a, few, people, like, mathematician, lucio, russo, to, claim, that, the, scientific, method, was, actually, born, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, be, largely, forgotten, during, the, roman, period, and, only, revived, in, full, during, the, renaissance, hellenistic, warfare, was, a, continuation, of, the, military, developments, of, iphicrates, and, philip, ii, of, macedon, particularly, his, use, of, the, macedonian, phalanx, a, dense, formation, of, pikemen, in, conjunction, with, heavy, companion, cavalry, armies, of, the, hellenistic, period, differed, from, those, of, the, classical, period, in, being, largely, made, up, of, professional, soldiers, and, also, in, their, greater, specialization, and, technical, proficiency, in, siege, warfare, hellenistic, armies, were, significantly, larger, than, those, of, classical, greece, relying, increasingly, on, greek, mercenaries, misthophoroi, men, for, pay, and, also, on, non, greek, soldiery, such, as, thracians, galatians, egyptians, and, iranians, some, ethnic, groups, were, known, for, their, martial, skill, in, a, particular, mode, of, combat, and, were, highly, sought, after, including, tarantine, cavalry, cretan, archers, rhodian, slingers, and, thracian, peltasts, this, period, also, saw, the, adoption, of, new, weapons, and, troop, types, such, as, thureophoroi, and, the, thorakitai, who, used, the, oval, thureos, shield, and, fought, with, javelins, and, the, machaira, sword, the, use, of, heavily, armored, cataphracts, and, also, horse, archers, was, adopted, by, the, seleucids, greco, bactrians, armenians, and, pontus, the, use, of, war, elephants, also, became, common, seleucus, received, indian, war, elephants, from, the, mauryan, empire, and, used, them, to, good, effect, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, he, kept, a, core, of, 500, of, them, at, apameia, the, ptolemies, used, the, smaller, african, elephant, hellenistic, military, equipment, was, generally, characterized, by, an, increase, in, size, hellenistic, era, warships, grew, from, the, trireme, to, include, more, banks, of, oars, and, larger, numbers, of, rowers, and, soldiers, as, in, the, quadrireme, and, quinquereme, the, ptolemaic, tessarakonteres, was, the, largest, ship, constructed, in, antiquity, new, siege, engines, were, developed, during, this, period, an, unknown, engineer, developed, the, torsion, spring, catapult, c, 360, bc, and, dionysios, of, alexandria, designed, a, repeating, ballista, the, polybolos, preserved, examples, of, ball, projectiles, range, from, 4, 4, to, 78, kg, 9, 7, to, 172, 0, lb, demetrius, poliorcetes, was, notorious, for, the, large, siege, engines, employed, in, his, campaigns, especially, during, the, 12, month, siege, of, rhodes, when, he, had, epimachos, of, athens, build, a, massive, 160, ton, siege, tower, named, helepolis, filled, with, artillery, the, term, hellenistic, is, a, modern, invention, the, hellenistic, world, not, only, included, a, huge, area, covering, the, whole, of, the, aegean, rather, than, the, classical, greece, focused, on, the, poleis, of, athens, and, sparta, but, also, a, huge, time, range, in, artistic, terms, this, means, that, there, is, huge, variety, which, is, often, put, under, the, heading, of, hellenistic, art, for, convenience, hardly, any, examples, of, hellenistic, paintings, or, sculptures, survive, but, we, have, many, roman, copies, for, hellenistic, sculpture, we, have, some, originals, including, laoco, n, and, his, sons, the, venus, de, milo, and, the, winged, victory, of, samothrace, many, surviving, frescoes, and, mosaics, from, the, roman, period, are, believed, to, be, loose, copies, of, hellenistic, paintings, but, it, is, difficult, to, assess, what, the, original, artworks, were, like, hellenistic, art, saw, a, turn, from, the, idealistic, perfected, calm, and, composed, figures, of, classical, greek, art, to, a, style, dominated, by, realism, and, the, depiction, of, emotion, pathos, and, character, ethos, the, motif, of, deceptively, realistic, naturalism, in, art, aletheia, is, reflected, in, stories, such, as, that, of, the, pre, hellenistic, painter, zeuxis, who, was, said, to, have, painted, grapes, that, seemed, so, real, that, birds, came, and, pecked, at, them, the, female, nude, also, became, more, popular, as, epitomized, by, the, aphrodite, of, cnidos, of, praxiteles, and, art, in, general, became, more, erotic, e, g, leda, and, the, swan, and, scopa, s, pothos, the, dominant, ideals, of, hellenistic, art, were, those, of, sensuality, and, passion, people, of, all, ages, and, social, statuses, were, depicted, in, the, art, of, the, hellenistic, age, artists, such, as, peiraikos, chose, mundane, and, lower, class, subjects, for, his, paintings, according, to, pliny, he, painted, barbers, shops, cobblers, stalls, asses, eatables, and, similar, subjects, earning, for, himself, the, name, of, rhyparographos, in, these, subjects, he, could, give, consummate, pleasure, selling, them, for, more, than, other, artists, received, for, their, large, pictures, natural, history, book, xxxv, 112, even, barbarians, such, as, the, galatians, were, depicted, in, heroic, form, prefiguring, the, artistic, theme, of, the, noble, savage, the, image, of, alexander, the, great, was, also, an, important, artistic, theme, and, all, of, the, diadochi, had, themselves, depicted, imitating, alexander, s, youthful, look, developments, in, painting, included, experiments, in, chiaroscuro, by, zeuxis, and, the, development, of, landscape, painting, and, still, life, painting, greek, temples, built, during, the, hellenistic, period, were, generally, larger, than, classical, ones, such, as, the, temple, of, artemis, at, ephesus, the, temple, of, artemis, at, sardis, and, the, temple, of, apollo, at, didyma, rebuilt, by, seleucus, in, 300, bc, the, royal, palace, basileion, also, came, into, its, own, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, first, extant, example, being, the, massive, 4th, century, villa, of, cassander, at, vergina, this, period, also, saw, the, first, written, works, of, art, history, in, the, histories, of, duris, of, samos, and, xenocrates, of, athens, a, sculptor, and, a, historian, of, sculpture, and, painting, there, has, been, a, trend, in, writing, the, history, of, this, period, to, depict, hellenistic, art, as, a, decadent, style, following, the, golden, age, of, classical, athens, pliny, the, elder, after, having, described, the, sculpture, of, the, classical, period, says, cessavit, deinde, ars, then, art, disappeared, the, 18th, century, terms, baroque, and, rococo, have, sometimes, been, applied, to, the, art, of, this, complex, and, individual, period, the, renewal, of, the, historiographical, approach, as, well, as, some, recent, discoveries, such, as, the, tombs, of, vergina, allow, a, better, appreciation, of, this, period, s, artistic, richness, throughout, the, hellenistic, period, several, sports, were, practiced, and, promoted, across, the, different, cities, and, kingdoms, of, the, time, sport, was, culturally, associated, as, a, major, compositional, component, of, the, hellenic, self, image, and, the, participation, in, athleticism, was, seen, as, an, important, civic, quality, for, representing, one, s, homeland, or, city, state, during, this, period, this, hellenic, perception, on, sport, would, go, on, to, spread, throughout, the, hellenistic, world, one, contrast, to, the, classical, period, is, that, the, increased, fluidity, of, citizenship, and, civic, identity, during, the, hellenistic, period, meant, that, there, arose, a, greater, emphasis, on, honoring, the, philanthropic, sponsors, of, athletic, festivals, rather, than, the, athletes, themselves, observed, by, the, scarcity, of, hellenistic, honorific, decrees, praising, athletes, as, highlighted, by, antiopi, argyriou, casmeridis, hunting, was, both, a, favorite, pastime, of, the, macedonian, kings, and, nobles, of, that, age, and, a, favorite, subject, for, paintings, in, egypt, the, ptolemaic, kings, sponsored, new, athletic, festivals, and, subsidize, egyptian, or, alexandrian, athletes, at, major, competitions, egyptian, kings, also, provided, funds, for, athletic, facilities, to, be, built, which, housed, ephebic, education, and, encouraged, citizens, to, partake, in, gymnasium, classes, ptolemaic, and, other, hellenistic, royals, often, competed, at, athletic, competitions, like, the, olympics, or, other, panathenaic, games, females, during, the, hellenistic, period, were, often, given, opportunities, to, show, off, they, athletic, abilities, in, similar, ways, to, men, in, egypt, ptolemaic, females, were, well, known, in, terms, of, court, and, during, equestrian, competitions, despite, females, being, banned, from, watching, sports, and, events, like, the, male, olympics, in, hellenistic, empires, female, sport, especially, equestrian, sport, flourished, discoveries, of, poems, in, 2001, depicted, eighteen, different, wins, for, equestrian, sport, these, wins, took, place, at, competitions, like, olympia, and, athens, and, all, originated, from, the, royal, court, several, of, these, wins, resulted, from, women, and, confirmed, the, desires, and, self, representation, of, hellenistic, rulers, as, they, tried, to, influence, the, greek, world, other, forms, of, leisure, activities, included, public, presentations, and, demonstrations, these, performances, were, often, orchestrated, by, the, royals, for, their, own, enjoyment, it, is, noted, that, these, events, were, catered, for, both, the, female, and, male, audiences, these, events, would, often, contain, displays, of, exotic, animals, and, other, paraphernalia, that, aided, to, display, their, wealth, and, the, territories, that, they, controlled, while, empires, during, the, hellenistic, period, ruled, they, witnessed, expansion, of, crown, or, iso, equal, to, major, athletic, festivals, this, movement, as, well, as, the, public, displays, for, royalty, were, both, trends, what, would, continue, into, the, roman, empire, the, focus, on, the, hellenistic, period, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, by, scholars, and, historians, has, led, to, an, issue, common, to, the, study, of, historical, periods, historians, see, the, period, of, focus, as, a, mirror, of, the, period, in, which, they, are, living, many, 19th, century, scholars, contended, that, the, hellenistic, period, represented, a, cultural, decline, from, the, brilliance, of, classical, greece, though, this, comparison, is, now, seen, as, unfair, and, meaningless, it, has, been, noted, that, even, commentators, of, the, time, saw, the, end, of, a, cultural, era, which, could, not, be, matched, again, this, may, be, inextricably, linked, with, the, nature, of, government, it, has, been, noted, by, herodotus, that, after, the, establishment, of, the, athenian, democracy, the, athenians, found, themselves, suddenly, a, great, power, not, just, in, one, field, but, in, everything, they, set, their, minds, to, as, subjects, of, a, tyrant, what, had, they, accomplished, held, down, like, slaves, they, had, shirked, and, slacked, once, they, had, won, their, freedom, not, a, citizen, but, he, could, feel, like, he, was, labouring, for, himself, thus, with, the, decline, of, the, greek, polis, and, the, establishment, of, monarchical, states, the, environment, and, social, freedom, in, which, to, excel, may, have, been, reduced, a, parallel, can, be, drawn, with, the, productivity, of, the, city, states, of, italy, during, the, renaissance, and, their, subsequent, decline, under, autocratic, rulers, however, william, woodthorpe, tarn, between, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, and, the, heyday, of, the, league, of, nations, focused, on, the, issues, of, racial, and, cultural, confrontation, and, the, nature, of, colonial, rule, michael, rostovtzeff, who, fled, the, russian, revolution, concentrated, predominantly, on, the, rise, of, the, capitalist, bourgeoisie, in, areas, of, greek, rule, arnaldo, momigliano, an, italian, jew, who, wrote, before, and, after, the, second, world, war, studied, the, problem, of, mutual, understanding, between, races, in, the, conquered, areas, moses, hadas, portrayed, an, optimistic, picture, of, synthesis, of, culture, from, the, perspective, of, the, 1950s, while, frank, william, walbank, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, had, a, materialistic, approach, to, the, hellenistic, period, focusing, mainly, on, class, relations, recently, however, papyrologist, c, pr, aux, has, concentrated, predominantly, on, the, economic, system, interactions, between, kings, and, cities, and, provides, a, generally, pessimistic, view, on, the, period, peter, green, on, the, other, hand, writes, from, the, point, of, view, of, late, 20th, century, liberalism, his, focus, being, on, individualism, the, breakdown, of, convention, experiments, and, a, postmodern, disillusionment, with, all, institutions, and, political, processes, alexander, s, conquests, expanded, the, influence, of, greek, culture, in, asia, which, many, centuries, later, contributed, to, the, spread, of, christianity, from, greek, one, of, alexander, s, generals, seleucus, i, nicator, who, controlled, most, of, asia, minor, syria, mesopotamia, and, the, iranian, plateau, after, alexander, s, death, founded, antioch, which, later, became, known, as, the, cradle, of, christianity, since, the, name, christian, for, jesus, followers, first, emerged, there, the, new, testament, of, the, bible, from, koine, greek, t, bibl, a, the, books, was, written,
