https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans
the, puritans, were, english, protestants, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, who, sought, to, rid, the, church, of, england, of, what, they, considered, to, be, roman, catholic, practices, maintaining, that, the, church, of, england, had, not, been, fully, reformed, and, should, become, more, protestant, puritanism, played, a, significant, role, in, english, and, early, american, history, especially, during, the, protectorate, puritans, were, dissatisfied, with, the, limited, extent, of, the, english, reformation, and, with, the, church, of, england, s, toleration, of, certain, practices, associated, with, the, roman, catholic, church, they, formed, and, identified, with, various, religious, groups, advocating, greater, purity, of, worship, and, doctrine, as, well, as, personal, and, corporate, piety, puritans, adopted, a, covenant, theology, and, in, that, sense, they, were, calvinists, as, were, many, of, their, earlier, opponents, in, church, polity, puritans, were, divided, between, supporters, of, episcopal, presbyterian, and, congregational, polities, some, believed, a, uniform, reform, of, the, established, church, was, called, for, to, create, a, godly, nation, while, others, advocated, separation, from, or, the, end, of, any, established, state, church, entirely, in, favour, of, autonomous, gathered, churches, called, out, from, the, world, these, separatist, and, independents, became, more, prominent, in, the, 1640s, when, the, supporters, of, a, presbyterian, polity, in, the, westminster, assembly, were, unable, to, forge, a, new, english, national, church, by, the, late, 1630s, puritans, were, in, alliance, with, the, growing, commercial, world, with, the, parliamentary, opposition, to, the, royal, prerogative, and, with, the, scottish, presbyterians, with, whom, they, had, much, in, common, consequently, they, became, a, major, political, force, in, england, and, came, to, power, as, a, result, of, the, first, english, civil, war, 1642, 1646, almost, all, puritan, clergy, left, the, church, of, england, after, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, in, 1660, and, the, 1662, uniformity, act, many, continued, to, practice, their, faith, in, nonconformist, denominations, especially, in, congregationalist, and, presbyterian, churches, the, nature, of, the, puritan, movement, in, england, changed, radically, in, new, england, it, retained, its, character, for, a, longer, period, puritanism, was, never, a, formally, defined, religious, division, within, protestantism, and, the, term, puritan, itself, was, rarely, used, after, the, turn, of, the, 18th, century, some, puritan, ideals, including, the, formal, rejection, of, roman, catholicism, were, incorporated, into, the, doctrines, of, the, church, of, england, others, were, absorbed, into, the, many, protestant, denominations, that, emerged, in, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, in, north, america, and, britain, the, congregational, churches, widely, considered, to, be, a, part, of, the, reformed, tradition, are, descended, from, the, puritans, moreover, puritan, beliefs, are, enshrined, in, the, savoy, declaration, the, confession, of, faith, held, by, the, congregationalist, churches, in, the, 17th, century, the, word, puritan, was, a, term, applied, not, to, just, one, group, but, to, many, historians, still, debate, a, precise, definition, of, puritanism, originally, puritan, was, a, pejorative, term, characterizing, certain, protestant, groups, as, extremist, thomas, fuller, in, his, church, history, dates, the, first, use, of, the, word, to, 1564, archbishop, matthew, parker, of, that, time, used, it, and, precisian, with, a, sense, similar, to, the, modern, stickler, puritans, then, were, distinguished, for, being, more, intensely, protestant, than, their, protestant, neighbors, or, even, the, church, of, england, as, a, term, of, abuse, puritan, was, not, used, by, puritans, themselves, those, referred, to, as, puritan, called, themselves, terms, such, as, the, godly, saints, professors, or, god, s, children, non, separating, puritans, were, dissatisfied, with, the, reformation, of, the, church, of, england, but, remained, within, it, advocating, for, further, reform, they, disagreed, among, themselves, about, how, much, further, reformation, was, possible, or, even, necessary, others, who, were, later, termed, nonconformists, separatists, or, separating, puritans, thought, the, church, of, england, was, so, corrupt, that, true, christians, should, separate, from, it, altogether, in, its, widest, historical, sense, the, term, puritan, includes, both, groups, puritans, should, not, be, confused, with, other, radical, protestant, groups, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, such, as, quakers, seekers, and, familists, who, believed, that, individuals, could, be, directly, guided, by, the, holy, spirit, they, gave, precedence, to, direct, revelation, over, the, bible, in, current, english, puritan, often, means, against, pleasure, in, such, usage, hedonism, and, puritanism, are, antonyms, william, shakespeare, described, the, vain, pompous, killjoy, malvolio, in, twelfth, night, as, a, kind, of, puritan, h, l, mencken, defined, puritanism, as, the, haunting, fear, that, someone, somewhere, may, be, happy, puritans, embraced, sexuality, but, placed, it, in, the, context, of, marriage, peter, gay, writes, that, the, puritans, standard, reputation, for, dour, prudery, was, a, misreading, that, went, unquestioned, in, the, nineteenth, century, he, said, they, were, in, favour, of, married, sexuality, and, opposed, the, catholic, veneration, of, virginity, associated, with, the, virgin, mary, citing, edward, taylor, and, john, cotton, one, puritan, settlement, in, western, massachusetts, banished, a, husband, because, he, refused, to, fulfill, his, sexual, duties, to, his, wife, puritanism, had, a, historical, importance, over, a, period, of, a, century, followed, by, fifty, years, of, development, in, new, england, it, changed, character, and, emphasis, nearly, decade, by, decade, over, that, time, the, elizabethan, religious, settlement, of, 1559, established, the, church, of, england, as, a, protestant, church, and, brought, the, english, reformation, to, a, close, during, the, reign, of, elizabeth, i, r, 1558, 1603, the, church, of, england, was, widely, considered, a, reformed, church, and, calvinists, held, the, best, bishoprics, and, deaneries, nevertheless, it, preserved, certain, characteristics, of, medieval, catholicism, such, as, cathedrals, church, choirs, a, formal, liturgy, contained, in, the, book, of, common, prayer, traditional, clerical, vestments, and, episcopal, polity, many, english, protestants, especially, those, former, marian, exiles, returning, to, england, to, work, as, clergy, and, bishops, considered, the, settlement, merely, the, first, step, in, reforming, england, s, church, the, years, of, exile, during, the, marian, restoration, had, exposed, them, to, the, practices, of, the, continental, reformed, churches, the, most, impatient, clergy, began, introducing, reforms, within, their, local, parishes, the, initial, conflict, between, puritans, and, the, authorities, included, instances, of, nonconformity, such, as, omitting, parts, of, the, liturgy, to, allow, more, time, for, the, sermon, and, singing, of, metrical, psalms, some, puritans, refused, to, bow, on, hearing, the, name, of, jesus, or, to, make, the, sign, of, the, cross, in, baptism, or, to, use, wedding, rings, or, the, organ, yet, the, main, complaint, puritans, had, was, the, requirement, that, clergy, wear, the, white, surplice, and, clerical, cap, puritan, clergymen, preferred, to, wear, black, academic, attire, during, the, vestments, controversy, church, authorities, attempted, and, failed, to, enforce, the, use, of, clerical, vestments, while, never, a, mass, movement, the, puritans, had, the, support, and, protection, of, powerful, patrons, in, the, aristocracy, in, the, 1570s, the, primary, dispute, between, puritans, and, the, authorities, was, over, the, appropriate, form, of, church, government, many, puritans, believed, that, the, church, of, england, should, follow, the, example, of, reformed, churches, in, other, parts, of, europe, and, adopt, presbyterian, polity, under, which, government, by, bishops, would, be, replaced, with, government, by, elders, but, all, attempts, to, enact, further, reforms, through, parliament, were, blocked, by, the, queen, despite, such, setbacks, puritan, leaders, such, as, john, field, and, thomas, cartwright, continued, to, promote, presbyterianism, through, the, formation, of, unofficial, clerical, conferences, that, allowed, puritan, clergymen, to, organise, and, network, this, covert, puritan, network, was, discovered, and, dismantled, during, the, marprelate, controversy, of, the, 1580s, for, the, remainder, of, elizabeth, s, reign, puritans, ceased, to, agitate, for, further, reform, the, accession, of, james, i, to, the, english, throne, brought, the, millenary, petition, a, puritan, manifesto, of, 1603, for, reform, of, the, english, church, but, james, wanted, a, religious, settlement, along, different, lines, he, called, the, hampton, court, conference, in, 1604, and, heard, the, teachings, of, four, prominent, puritan, leaders, including, laurence, chaderton, but, largely, sided, with, his, bishops, he, was, well, informed, on, theological, matters, by, his, education, and, scottish, upbringing, and, he, dealt, shortly, with, the, peevish, legacy, of, elizabethan, puritanism, pursuing, an, eirenic, religious, policy, in, which, he, was, arbiter, many, of, james, s, episcopal, appointments, were, calvinists, notably, james, montague, who, was, an, influential, courtier, puritans, still, opposed, much, of, the, roman, catholic, summation, in, the, church, of, england, notably, the, book, of, common, prayer, but, also, the, use, of, non, secular, vestments, cap, and, gown, during, services, the, sign, of, the, cross, in, baptism, and, kneeling, to, receive, holy, communion, some, of, the, bishops, under, both, elizabeth, and, james, tried, to, suppress, puritanism, though, other, bishops, were, more, tolerant, in, many, places, individual, ministers, were, able, to, omit, disliked, portions, of, the, revised, book, of, common, prayer, the, puritan, movement, of, jacobean, times, became, distinctive, by, adaptation, and, compromise, with, the, emergence, of, semi, separatism, moderate, puritanism, the, writings, of, william, bradshaw, who, adopted, the, term, puritan, for, himself, and, the, beginnings, of, congregationalism, most, puritans, of, this, period, were, non, separating, and, remained, within, the, church, of, england, separatists, who, left, the, church, of, england, altogether, were, numerically, much, fewer, the, puritan, movement, in, england, was, riven, over, decades, by, emigration, and, inconsistent, interpretations, of, scripture, as, well, as, some, political, differences, that, surfaced, at, that, time, the, fifth, monarchy, men, a, radical, millenarian, wing, of, puritanism, aided, by, strident, popular, clergy, like, vavasor, powell, agitated, from, the, right, wing, of, the, movement, even, as, sectarian, groups, like, the, ranters, levellers, and, quakers, pulled, from, the, left, the, fragmentation, created, a, collapse, of, the, centre, and, ultimately, sealed, a, political, failure, while, depositing, an, enduring, spiritual, legacy, that, would, remain, and, grow, in, english, speaking, christianity, the, westminster, assembly, was, called, in, 1643, assembling, clergy, of, the, church, of, england, the, assembly, was, able, to, agree, to, the, westminster, confession, of, faith, doctrinally, a, consistent, reformed, theological, position, the, directory, of, public, worship, was, made, official, in, 1645, and, the, larger, framework, now, called, the, westminster, standards, was, adopted, by, the, church, of, scotland, in, england, the, standards, were, contested, by, independents, up, to, 1660, the, westminster, divines, on, the, other, hand, were, divided, over, questions, of, church, polity, and, split, into, factions, supporting, a, reformed, episcopacy, presbyterianism, congregationalism, and, erastianism, the, membership, of, the, assembly, was, strongly, weighted, towards, the, presbyterians, but, oliver, cromwell, was, a, puritan, and, an, independent, congregationalist, separatist, who, imposed, his, doctrines, upon, them, the, church, of, england, of, the, interregnum, 1649, 60, was, run, along, presbyterian, lines, but, never, became, a, national, presbyterian, church, such, as, existed, in, scotland, england, was, not, the, theocratic, state, which, leading, puritans, had, called, for, as, godly, rule, at, the, time, of, the, english, restoration, in, 1660, the, savoy, conference, was, called, to, determine, a, new, religious, settlement, for, england, and, wales, under, the, act, of, uniformity, 1662, the, church, of, england, was, restored, to, its, pre, civil, war, constitution, with, only, minor, changes, and, the, puritans, found, themselves, sidelined, a, traditional, estimate, of, historian, calamy, is, that, around, 2, 400, puritan, clergy, left, the, church, in, the, great, ejection, of, 1662, at, this, point, the, term, dissenter, came, to, include, puritan, but, more, accurately, described, those, clergy, or, lay, who, dissented, from, the, 1662, book, of, common, prayer, the, dissenters, divided, themselves, from, all, other, christians, in, the, church, of, england, and, established, their, own, separatist, congregations, in, the, 1660s, and, 1670s, an, estimated, 1, 800, of, the, ejected, clergy, continued, in, some, fashion, as, ministers, of, religion, according, to, richard, baxter, the, government, initially, attempted, to, suppress, these, schismatic, organisations, by, using, the, clarendon, code, there, followed, a, period, in, which, schemes, of, comprehension, were, proposed, under, which, presbyterians, could, be, brought, back, into, the, church, of, england, but, nothing, resulted, from, them, the, whigs, opposed, the, court, religious, policies, and, argued, that, the, dissenters, should, be, allowed, to, worship, separately, from, the, established, church, this, position, ultimately, prevailed, when, the, toleration, act, was, passed, in, the, wake, of, the, glorious, revolution, in, 1689, this, permitted, the, licensing, of, dissenting, ministers, and, the, building, of, chapels, the, term, nonconformist, generally, replaced, the, term, dissenter, from, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, some, puritans, left, for, new, england, particularly, from, 1629, to, 1640, the, eleven, years, tyranny, under, king, charles, i, supporting, the, founding, of, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, and, other, settlements, among, the, northern, colonies, the, large, scale, puritan, migration, to, new, england, ceased, by, 1641, with, around, 21, 000, persons, having, moved, across, the, atlantic, this, english, speaking, population, in, the, united, states, was, not, descended, from, all, of, the, original, colonists, since, many, returned, to, england, shortly, after, arriving, on, the, continent, but, it, produced, more, than, 16, million, descendants, this, so, called, great, migration, is, not, so, named, because, of, sheer, numbers, which, were, much, less, than, the, number, of, english, citizens, who, immigrated, to, virginia, and, the, caribbean, during, this, time, many, as, indentured, servants, the, rapid, growth, of, the, new, england, colonies, around, 700, 000, by, 1790, was, almost, entirely, due, to, the, high, birth, rate, and, lower, death, rate, per, year, they, had, formed, families, more, rapidly, than, did, the, southern, colonies, puritan, hegemony, lasted, for, at, least, a, century, that, century, can, be, broken, down, into, three, parts, the, generation, of, john, cotton, and, richard, mather, 1630, 62, from, the, founding, to, the, restoration, years, of, virtual, independence, and, nearly, autonomous, development, the, generation, of, increase, mather, 1662, 89, from, the, restoration, and, the, halfway, covenant, to, the, glorious, revolution, years, of, struggle, with, the, british, crown, and, the, generation, of, cotton, mather, 1689, 1728, from, the, overthrow, of, edmund, andros, in, which, cotton, mather, played, a, part, and, the, new, charter, mediated, by, increase, mather, to, the, death, of, cotton, mather, puritan, leaders, were, political, thinkers, and, writers, who, considered, the, church, government, to, be, god, s, agency, in, social, life, the, puritans, in, the, colonies, wanted, their, children, to, be, able, to, read, and, interpret, the, bible, themselves, rather, than, have, to, rely, on, the, clergy, for, interpretation, in, 1635, they, established, the, boston, latin, school, to, educate, their, sons, the, first, and, oldest, formal, education, institution, in, the, english, speaking, new, world, they, also, set, up, what, were, called, dame, schools, for, their, daughters, and, in, other, cases, taught, their, daughters, at, home, how, to, read, as, a, result, puritans, were, among, the, most, literate, societies, in, the, world, by, the, time, of, the, american, revolution, there, were, 40, newspapers, in, the, united, states, at, a, time, when, there, were, only, two, cities, new, york, and, philadelphia, with, as, many, as, 20, 000, people, in, them, the, puritans, also, set, up, a, college, now, harvard, university, only, six, years, after, arriving, in, boston, christianity, protestantism, puritanism, broadly, refers, to, a, diverse, religious, reform, movement, in, britain, committed, to, the, continental, reformed, tradition, while, puritans, did, not, agree, on, all, doctrinal, points, most, shared, similar, views, on, the, nature, of, god, human, sinfulness, and, the, relationship, between, god, and, mankind, they, believed, that, all, of, their, beliefs, should, be, based, on, the, bible, which, they, considered, to, be, divinely, inspired, the, concept, of, covenant, was, extremely, important, to, puritans, and, covenant, theology, was, central, to, their, beliefs, with, roots, in, the, writings, of, reformed, theologians, john, calvin, and, heinrich, bullinger, covenant, theology, was, further, developed, by, puritan, theologians, dudley, fenner, william, perkins, john, preston, richard, sibbes, william, ames, and, most, fully, by, ames, s, dutch, student, johannes, cocceius, covenant, theology, asserts, that, when, god, created, adam, and, eve, he, promised, them, eternal, life, in, return, for, perfect, obedience, this, promise, was, termed, the, covenant, of, works, after, the, fall, of, man, human, nature, was, corrupted, by, original, sin, and, unable, to, fulfill, the, covenant, of, works, since, each, person, inevitably, violated, god, s, law, as, expressed, in, the, ten, commandments, as, sinners, every, person, deserved, damnation, puritans, shared, with, other, calvinists, a, belief, in, double, predestination, that, some, people, the, elect, were, destined, by, god, to, receive, grace, and, salvation, while, others, were, destined, for, hell, no, one, however, could, merit, salvation, according, to, covenant, theology, christ, s, sacrifice, on, the, cross, made, possible, the, covenant, of, grace, by, which, those, selected, by, god, could, be, saved, puritans, believed, in, unconditional, election, and, irresistible, grace, god, s, grace, was, given, freely, without, condition, to, the, elect, and, could, not, be, refused, covenant, theology, made, individual, salvation, deeply, personal, it, held, that, god, s, predestination, was, not, impersonal, and, mechanical, but, was, a, covenant, of, grace, that, one, entered, into, by, faith, therefore, being, a, christian, could, never, be, reduced, to, simple, intellectual, acknowledgment, of, the, truth, of, christianity, puritans, agreed, that, the, effectual, call, of, each, elect, saint, of, god, would, always, come, as, an, individuated, personal, encounter, with, god, s, promises, the, process, by, which, the, elect, are, brought, from, spiritual, death, to, spiritual, life, regeneration, was, described, as, conversion, early, on, puritans, did, not, consider, a, specific, conversion, experience, normative, or, necessary, but, many, gained, assurance, of, salvation, from, such, experiences, over, time, however, puritan, theologians, developed, a, framework, for, authentic, religious, experience, based, on, their, own, experiences, as, well, as, those, of, their, parishioners, eventually, puritans, came, to, regard, a, specific, conversion, experience, as, an, essential, mark, of, one, s, election, the, puritan, conversion, experience, was, commonly, described, as, occurring, in, discrete, phases, it, began, with, a, preparatory, phase, designed, to, produce, contrition, for, sin, through, introspection, bible, study, and, listening, to, preaching, this, was, followed, by, humiliation, when, the, sinner, realized, that, he, or, she, was, helpless, to, break, free, from, sin, and, that, their, good, works, could, never, earn, forgiveness, it, was, after, reaching, this, point, the, realization, that, salvation, was, possible, only, because, of, divine, mercy, that, the, person, would, experience, justification, when, the, righteousness, of, christ, is, imputed, to, the, elect, and, their, minds, and, hearts, are, regenerated, for, some, puritans, this, was, a, dramatic, experience, and, they, referred, to, it, as, being, born, again, confirming, that, such, a, conversion, had, actually, happened, often, required, prolonged, and, continual, introspection, historian, perry, miller, wrote, that, the, puritans, liberated, men, from, the, treadmill, of, indulgences, and, penances, but, cast, them, on, the, iron, couch, of, introspection, it, was, expected, that, conversion, would, be, followed, by, sanctification, the, progressive, growth, in, the, saint, s, ability, to, better, perceive, and, seek, god, s, will, and, thus, to, lead, a, holy, life, some, puritans, attempted, to, find, assurance, of, their, faith, by, keeping, detailed, records, of, their, behavior, and, looking, for, the, evidence, of, salvation, in, their, lives, puritan, clergy, wrote, many, spiritual, guides, to, help, their, parishioners, pursue, personal, piety, and, sanctification, these, included, arthur, dent, s, the, plain, man, s, pathway, to, heaven, 1601, richard, rogers, s, seven, treatises, 1603, henry, scudder, s, christian, s, daily, walk, 1627, and, richard, sibbes, s, the, bruised, reed, and, smoking, flax, 1630, too, much, emphasis, on, one, s, good, works, could, be, criticized, for, being, too, close, to, arminianism, and, too, much, emphasis, on, subjective, religious, experience, could, be, criticized, as, antinomianism, many, puritans, relied, on, both, personal, religious, experience, and, self, examination, to, assess, their, spiritual, condition, puritanism, s, experiential, piety, would, be, inherited, by, the, evangelical, protestants, of, the, 18th, century, while, evangelical, views, on, conversion, were, heavily, influenced, by, puritan, theology, the, puritans, believed, that, assurance, of, one, s, salvation, was, rare, late, and, the, fruit, of, struggle, in, the, experience, of, believers, whereas, evangelicals, believed, that, assurance, was, normative, for, all, the, truly, converted, while, most, puritans, were, members, of, the, church, of, england, they, were, critical, of, its, worship, practices, in, the, 17th, century, sunday, worship, in, the, established, church, took, the, form, of, the, morning, prayer, service, in, the, book, of, common, prayer, this, may, include, a, sermon, but, holy, communion, or, the, lord, s, supper, was, only, occasionally, observed, officially, lay, people, were, only, required, to, receive, communion, three, times, a, year, but, most, people, only, received, communion, once, a, year, at, easter, puritans, were, concerned, about, biblical, errors, and, catholic, remnants, within, the, prayer, book, puritans, objected, to, bowing, at, the, name, of, jesus, the, requirement, that, priests, wear, the, surplice, and, the, use, of, written, set, prayers, in, place, of, improvised, prayers, the, sermon, was, central, to, puritan, piety, it, was, not, only, a, means, of, religious, education, puritans, believed, it, was, the, most, common, way, that, god, prepared, a, sinner, s, heart, for, conversion, on, sundays, puritan, ministers, often, shortened, the, liturgy, to, allow, more, time, for, preaching, puritan, churchgoers, attended, two, sermons, on, sundays, and, as, many, weekday, sermons, and, lectures, they, could, find, often, traveling, for, miles, puritans, were, distinct, for, their, adherence, to, sabbatarianism, puritans, taught, that, there, were, two, sacraments, baptism, and, the, lord, s, supper, puritans, agreed, with, the, church, s, practice, of, infant, baptism, however, the, effect, of, baptism, was, disputed, puritans, objected, to, the, prayer, book, s, assertion, of, baptismal, regeneration, in, puritan, theology, infant, baptism, was, understood, in, terms, of, covenant, theology, baptism, replaced, circumcision, as, a, sign, of, the, covenant, and, marked, a, child, s, admission, into, the, visible, church, it, could, not, be, assumed, that, baptism, produces, regeneration, the, westminster, confession, states, that, the, grace, of, baptism, is, only, effective, for, those, who, are, among, the, elect, and, its, effects, lie, dormant, until, one, experiences, conversion, later, in, life, puritans, wanted, to, do, away, with, godparents, who, made, baptismal, vows, on, behalf, of, infants, and, give, that, responsibility, to, the, child, s, father, puritans, also, objected, to, priests, making, the, sign, of, the, cross, in, baptism, private, baptisms, were, opposed, because, puritans, believed, that, preaching, should, always, accompany, sacraments, some, puritan, clergy, even, refused, to, baptise, dying, infants, because, that, implied, the, sacrament, contributed, to, salvation, puritans, rejected, both, roman, catholic, transubstantiation, and, lutheran, sacramental, union, teachings, that, christ, is, physically, present, in, the, bread, and, wine, of, the, lord, s, supper, instead, puritans, embraced, the, reformed, doctrine, of, real, spiritual, presence, believing, that, in, the, lord, s, supper, the, faithful, receive, christ, spiritually, in, agreement, with, thomas, cranmer, the, puritans, stressed, that, christ, comes, down, to, us, in, the, sacrament, by, his, word, and, spirit, offering, himself, as, our, spiritual, food, and, drink, they, criticised, the, prayer, book, service, for, being, too, similar, to, the, catholic, mass, for, example, the, requirement, that, people, kneel, to, receive, communion, implied, adoration, of, the, eucharist, a, practice, linked, to, transubstantiation, puritans, also, criticised, the, church, of, england, for, allowing, unrepentant, sinners, to, receive, communion, puritans, wanted, better, spiritual, preparation, such, as, clergy, home, visits, and, testing, people, on, their, knowledge, of, the, catechism, for, communion, and, better, church, discipline, to, ensure, that, the, unworthy, were, kept, from, the, sacrament, puritans, did, not, believe, confirmation, was, necessary, and, thought, candidates, were, poorly, prepared, since, bishops, did, not, have, the, time, to, examine, them, properly, the, marriage, service, was, criticised, for, using, a, wedding, ring, which, implied, that, marriage, was, a, sacrament, and, having, the, groom, vow, to, his, bride, with, my, body, i, thee, worship, which, puritans, considered, blasphemous, in, the, funeral, service, the, priest, committed, the, body, to, the, ground, in, sure, and, certain, hope, of, resurrection, to, eternal, life, through, our, lord, jesus, christ, puritans, objected, to, this, phrase, because, they, did, not, believe, it, was, true, for, everyone, they, suggested, it, be, rewritten, as, we, commit, his, body, believing, a, resurrection, of, the, just, and, unjust, some, to, joy, and, some, to, punishment, puritans, eliminated, choral, music, and, musical, instruments, in, their, religious, services, because, these, were, associated, with, roman, catholicism, however, singing, the, psalms, was, considered, appropriate, see, exclusive, psalmody, church, organs, were, commonly, damaged, or, destroyed, in, the, civil, war, period, such, as, when, an, axe, was, taken, to, the, organ, of, worcester, cathedral, in, 1642, while, the, puritans, were, united, in, their, goal, of, furthering, the, english, reformation, they, were, always, divided, over, issues, of, ecclesiology, and, church, polity, specifically, questions, relating, to, the, manner, of, organizing, congregations, how, individual, congregations, should, relate, with, one, another, and, whether, established, national, churches, were, scriptural, on, these, questions, puritans, divided, between, supporters, of, episcopal, polity, presbyterian, polity, and, congregational, polity, the, episcopalians, known, as, the, prelatical, party, were, conservatives, who, supported, retaining, bishops, if, those, leaders, supported, reform, and, agreed, to, share, power, with, local, churches, they, also, supported, the, idea, of, having, a, book, of, common, prayer, but, they, were, against, demanding, strict, conformity, or, having, too, much, ceremony, in, addition, these, puritans, called, for, a, renewal, of, preaching, pastoral, care, and, christian, discipline, within, the, church, of, england, like, the, episcopalians, the, presbyterians, agreed, that, there, should, be, a, national, church, but, one, structured, on, the, model, of, the, church, of, scotland, they, wanted, to, replace, bishops, with, a, system, of, elective, and, representative, governing, bodies, of, clergy, and, laity, local, sessions, presbyteries, synods, and, ultimately, a, national, general, assembly, during, the, interregnum, the, presbyterians, had, limited, success, at, reorganizing, the, church, of, england, the, westminster, assembly, proposed, the, creation, of, a, presbyterian, system, but, the, long, parliament, left, implementation, to, local, authorities, as, a, result, the, church, of, england, never, developed, a, complete, presbyterian, hierarchy, congregationalists, or, independents, believed, in, the, autonomy, of, the, local, church, which, ideally, would, be, a, congregation, of, visible, saints, meaning, those, who, had, experienced, conversion, members, would, be, required, to, abide, by, a, church, covenant, in, which, they, pledged, to, join, in, the, proper, worship, of, god, and, to, nourish, each, other, in, the, search, for, further, religious, truth, such, churches, were, regarded, as, complete, within, themselves, with, full, authority, to, determine, their, own, membership, administer, their, own, discipline, and, ordain, their, own, ministers, furthermore, the, sacraments, would, only, be, administered, to, those, in, the, church, covenant, most, congregational, puritans, remained, within, the, church, of, england, hoping, to, reform, it, according, to, their, own, views, the, new, england, congregationalists, were, also, adamant, that, they, were, not, separating, from, the, church, of, england, however, some, puritans, equated, the, church, of, england, with, the, roman, catholic, church, and, therefore, considered, it, no, christian, church, at, all, these, groups, such, as, the, brownists, would, split, from, the, established, church, and, become, known, as, separatists, other, separatists, embraced, more, radical, positions, on, separation, of, church, and, state, and, believer, s, baptism, becoming, early, baptists, based, on, biblical, portrayals, of, adam, and, eve, puritans, believed, that, marriage, was, rooted, in, procreation, love, and, most, importantly, salvation, husbands, were, the, spiritual, heads, of, the, household, while, women, were, to, demonstrate, religious, piety, and, obedience, under, male, authority, furthermore, marriage, represented, not, only, the, relationship, between, husband, and, wife, but, also, the, relationship, between, spouses, and, god, puritan, husbands, commanded, authority, through, family, direction, and, prayer, the, female, relationship, to, her, husband, and, to, god, was, marked, by, submissiveness, and, humility, thomas, gataker, describes, puritan, marriage, as, together, for, a, time, as, copartners, in, grace, here, they, may, reigne, together, forever, as, coheires, in, glory, hereafter, the, paradox, created, by, female, inferiority, in, the, public, sphere, and, the, spiritual, equality, of, men, and, women, in, marriage, then, gave, way, to, the, informal, authority, of, women, concerning, matters, of, the, home, and, childrearing, with, the, consent, of, their, husbands, wives, made, important, decisions, concerning, the, labour, of, their, children, property, and, the, management, of, inns, and, taverns, owned, by, their, husbands, pious, puritan, mothers, laboured, for, their, children, s, righteousness, and, salvation, connecting, women, directly, to, matters, of, religion, and, morality, in, her, poem, titled, in, reference, to, her, children, poet, anne, bradstreet, reflects, on, her, role, as, a, mother, i, had, eight, birds, hatched, in, one, nest, four, cocks, there, were, and, hens, the, rest, i, nursed, them, up, with, pain, and, care, nor, cost, nor, labour, i, did, spare, bradstreet, alludes, to, the, temporality, of, motherhood, by, comparing, her, children, to, a, flock, of, birds, on, the, precipice, of, leaving, home, while, puritans, praised, the, obedience, of, young, children, they, also, believed, that, by, separating, children, from, their, mothers, at, adolescence, children, could, better, sustain, a, superior, relationship, with, god, a, child, could, only, be, redeemed, through, religious, education, and, obedience, girls, carried, the, additional, burden, of, eve, s, corruption, and, were, catechised, separately, from, boys, at, adolescence, boys, education, prepared, them, for, vocations, and, leadership, roles, while, girls, were, educated, for, domestic, and, religious, purposes, the, pinnacle, of, achievement, for, children, in, puritan, society, however, occurred, with, the, conversion, process, puritans, viewed, the, relationship, between, master, and, servant, similarly, to, that, of, parent, and, child, just, as, parents, were, expected, to, uphold, puritan, religious, values, in, the, home, masters, assumed, the, parental, responsibility, of, housing, and, educating, young, servants, older, servants, also, dwelt, with, masters, and, were, cared, for, in, the, event, of, illness, or, injury, african, american, and, indian, servants, were, likely, excluded, from, such, benefits, like, most, christians, in, the, early, modern, period, puritans, believed, in, the, active, existence, of, the, devil, and, demons, as, evil, forces, that, could, possess, and, cause, harm, to, men, and, women, there, was, also, widespread, belief, in, witchcraft, and, witches, persons, in, league, with, the, devil, unexplained, phenomena, such, as, the, death, of, livestock, human, disease, and, hideous, fits, suffered, by, young, and, old, may, all, be, blamed, on, the, agency, of, the, devil, or, a, witch, puritan, pastors, undertook, exorcisms, for, demonic, possession, in, some, high, profile, cases, exorcist, john, darrell, was, supported, by, arthur, hildersham, in, the, case, of, thomas, darling, samuel, harsnett, a, sceptic, on, witchcraft, and, possession, attacked, darrell, however, harsnett, was, in, the, minority, and, many, clergy, not, only, puritans, believed, in, witchcraft, and, possession, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, thousands, of, people, throughout, europe, were, accused, of, being, witches, and, executed, in, england, and, colonial, america, puritans, engaged, in, witch, hunts, as, well, in, the, 1640s, matthew, hopkins, the, self, proclaimed, witchfinder, general, whose, career, flourished, during, puritan, rule, was, responsible, for, accusing, over, two, hundred, people, of, witchcraft, mainly, in, east, anglia, between, 1644, and, 1647, hopkins, and, his, colleague, john, stearne, sent, more, accused, people, to, the, gallows, than, all, the, other, witch, hunters, in, england, of, the, previous, 160, years, in, new, england, few, people, were, accused, and, convicted, of, witchcraft, before, 1692, there, were, at, most, sixteen, convictions, the, salem, witch, trials, of, 1692, had, a, lasting, impact, on, the, historical, reputation, of, new, england, puritans, though, this, witch, hunt, occurred, after, puritans, lost, political, control, of, the, massachusetts, colony, puritans, instigated, the, judicial, proceedings, against, the, accused, and, comprised, the, members, of, the, court, that, convicted, and, sentenced, the, accused, by, the, time, governor, william, phips, ended, the, trials, fourteen, women, and, five, men, had, been, hanged, as, witches, puritan, millennialism, has, been, placed, in, the, broader, context, of, european, reformed, beliefs, about, the, millennium, and, interpretation, of, biblical, prophecy, for, which, representative, figures, of, the, period, were, johannes, piscator, thomas, brightman, joseph, mede, johannes, heinrich, alsted, and, john, amos, comenius, like, most, english, protestants, of, the, time, puritans, based, their, eschatological, views, on, an, historicist, interpretation, of, the, book, of, revelation, and, the, book, of, daniel, protestant, theologians, identified, the, sequential, phases, the, world, must, pass, through, before, the, last, judgment, could, occur, and, tended, to, place, their, own, time, period, near, the, end, it, was, expected, that, tribulation, and, persecution, would, increase, but, eventually, the, church, s, enemies, the, antichrist, identified, with, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, ottoman, empire, would, be, defeated, based, on, revelation, 20, it, was, believed, that, a, thousand, year, period, the, millennium, would, occur, during, which, the, saints, would, rule, with, christ, on, earth, in, contrast, to, other, protestants, who, tended, to, view, eschatology, as, an, explanation, for, god, s, remote, plans, for, the, world, and, man, puritans, understood, it, to, describe, the, cosmic, environment, in, which, the, regenerate, soldier, of, christ, was, now, to, do, battle, against, the, power, of, sin, on, a, personal, level, eschatology, was, related, to, sanctification, assurance, of, salvation, and, the, conversion, experience, on, a, larger, level, eschatology, was, the, lens, through, which, events, such, as, the, english, civil, war, and, the, thirty, years, war, were, interpreted, there, was, also, an, optimistic, aspect, to, puritan, millennianism, puritans, anticipated, a, future, worldwide, religious, revival, before, the, second, coming, of, christ, another, departure, from, other, protestants, was, the, widespread, belief, among, puritans, that, the, conversion, of, the, jews, to, christianity, was, an, important, sign, of, the, apocalypse, some, strong, religious, beliefs, common, to, puritans, had, direct, impacts, on, culture, puritans, believed, it, was, the, government, s, responsibility, to, enforce, moral, standards, and, ensure, true, religious, worship, was, established, and, maintained, education, was, essential, to, every, person, male, and, female, so, that, they, could, read, the, bible, for, themselves, however, the, puritans, emphasis, on, individual, spiritual, independence, was, not, always, compatible, with, the, community, cohesion, that, was, also, a, strong, ideal, anne, hutchinson, 1591, 1643, the, well, educated, daughter, of, a, teacher, argued, with, the, established, theological, orthodoxy, and, was, forced, to, leave, colonial, new, england, with, her, followers, at, a, time, when, the, literacy, rate, in, england, was, less, than, 30, per, cent, the, puritan, leaders, of, colonial, new, england, believed, children, should, be, educated, for, both, religious, and, civil, reasons, and, they, worked, to, achieve, universal, literacy, in, 1642, massachusetts, required, heads, of, households, to, teach, their, wives, children, and, servants, basic, reading, and, writing, so, that, they, could, read, the, bible, and, understand, colonial, laws, in, 1647, the, government, required, all, towns, with, 50, or, more, households, to, hire, a, teacher, and, towns, of, 100, or, more, households, to, hire, a, grammar, school, instructor, to,

in, the, ministry, were, often, sent, to, colleges, such, as, harvard, founded, in, 1636, or, yale, founded, in, 1707, aspiring, lawyers, or, doctors, apprenticed, to, a, local, practitioner, or, in, rare, cases, were, sent, to, england, or, scotland, the, merton, thesis, is, an, argument, about, the, nature, of, early, experimental, science, proposed, by, robert, k, merton, similarly, to, max, weber, s, famous, claim, on, the, link, between, the, protestant, work, ethic, and, the, capitalist, economy, merton, argued, for, a, positive, correlation, between, the, rise, of, english, puritanism, as, well, as, german, pietism, and, early, experimental, science, as, an, example, seven, of, 10, nucleus, members, of, the, royal, society, were, puritans, in, the, year, 1663, 62, per, cent, of, the, members, of, the, royal, society, were, similarly, identified, the, merton, thesis, has, resulted, in, continuous, debates, puritans, in, both, england, and, new, england, believed, that, the, state, should, protect, and, promote, true, religion, and, that, religion, should, influence, politics, and, social, life, certain, holidays, were, outlawed, when, puritans, came, to, power, in, 1647, parliament, outlawed, the, celebration, of, christmas, easter, and, whitsuntide, puritans, strongly, condemned, the, celebration, of, christmas, considering, it, a, catholic, invention, and, the, trappings, of, popery, or, the, rags, of, the, beast, they, also, objected, to, christmas, because, the, festivities, surrounding, the, holiday, were, seen, as, impious, english, jails, were, usually, filled, with, drunken, revelers, and, brawlers, during, the, years, that, the, puritan, ban, on, christmas, was, in, place, in, england, protests, occurred, over, the,

outlawed, in, boston, from, 1659, the, ban, was, revoked, in, 1681, by, the, english, appointed, governor, edmund, andros, who, also, revoked, a, puritan, ban, on, festivities, on, saturday, nights, nevertheless, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 19th, century, that, celebrating, christmas, became, fashionable, in, the, boston, region, attempting, to, force, religious, and, intellectual, homogeneity, on, the, whole, community, civil, and, religious, restrictions, were, most, strictly, applied, by, the, puritans, of, massachusetts, which, saw, various, banishments, applied, to,

defined, as, a, cursing, of, god, by, atheism, or, the, like, punishable, by, death, puritans, were, opposed, to, sunday, sport, or, recreation, because, these, distracted, from, religious, observance, of, the, sabbath, in, an, attempt, to, offset, the, strictness, of, the, puritans, james, i, s, book, of, sports, 1618, permitted, christians, to, play, football, every, sunday, afternoon, after, worship, when, the, puritans, established, themselves, in, power, football, was, among, the, sports, that, were, banned, boys, caught, playing, on, sunday, could, be, prosecuted, football, was, also, used, as, a, rebellious, force, when, puritans, outlawed, christmas, in, england, in, december, 1647, the, crowd, brought, out, footballs, as, a, symbol, of, festive, misrule, other, forms, of, leisure, and, entertainment, were, completely, forbidden, on, moral, grounds, for, example, puritans, were, universally, opposed, to, blood, sports, such, as, bearbaiting, and, cockfighting, because, they, involved, unnecessary, injury, to, god, s, creatures, for, similar, reasons, they, also, opposed, boxing, these, sports, were, illegal, in, england, during, puritan, rule, while, card, playing, by, itself, was, generally, considered, acceptable, card, playing, and, gambling, were, banned, in, england, and, the, colonies, as, was, mixed, dancing, involving, men, and, women, which, mather, condemned, as, promiscuous, dancing, because, it, was, thought, to, lead, to, fornication, folk, dance, that, did, not, involve, close, contact, between, men, and, women, was, considered, appropriate, the, branle, dance, which, involved, couples, intertwining, arms, or, holding, hands, returned, to, popularity, in, england, after, the, restoration, when, the, bans, imposed, by, the, puritans, were,

and, the, colony, pressed, pynchon, to, return, to, england, which, he, did, the, censorious, nature, of, the, puritans, and, the, region, they, inhabited, would, lead, to, the, phrase, banned, in,

behavior, were, seen, as, especially, sinful, with, some, executed, while, the, practice, of, execution, was, also, infrequently, used, for, rape, and, adultery, homosexuality, was, actually, seen, as, a, worse, sin, passages, from, the, old, testament, including, lev, 20, 13, were, thought, to, support, the, disgust, for, homosexuality, and, efforts, to, purge, society, of, it, new, haven, code, stated, if, any, man, lyeth, with, mankinde, as, a, man, lyeth, with, a, woman, both, of, them, have, committed, abomination, they, shall, surely, be, put, to, death, and, in, 1636, the,

recording, births, marriages, and, deaths, was, transferred, from, the, church, to, a, civil, registrar, the, result, was, that, church, baptisms, and, marriages, became, private, acts, not,

theologies, the, puritans, of, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, were, the, most, active, of, the, new, england, persecutors, of, quakers, and, the, persecuting, spirit, was, shared, by, the, plymouth, colony, and, the, colonies, along, the, connecticut, river, four, quakers, known, as, the, boston, martyrs, were, executed, the, first, two, of, the, four, boston, martyrs, were, executed, by, the,

the, year, 1660, for, being, quakers, puritanism, has, attracted, much, scholarly, attention, and, as, a, result, the, secondary, literature, on, the, subject, is, vast, puritanism, is, considered, crucial, to, understanding, the, religious, political, and, cultural, issues, of, early, modern, england, in, addition, historians, such, as, perry, miller, have, regarded, puritan, new, england, as, fundamental, to, understanding, american, culture, and, identity, puritanism, has, also, been, credited, with, the, creation, of, modernity, itself, from, england, s, scientific, revolution, to, the,

be, read, and, studied, as, important, figures, within, english, and, american, literature, a, debate, continues, on, the, definition, of, puritanism, english, historian, patrick, collinson, argues, that, there, is, little, point, in, constructing, elaborate, statements, defining, what, in, ontological, terms, puritanism, was, and, what, it, was, not, when, it, was, not, a, thing, definable, in, itself, but, only, one, half, of, a, stressful, relationship, puritanism, was, only, the, mirror, image, of, anti, puritanism, and, to, a, considerable, extent, its, invention, a, stigma, with, great, power, to, distract, and, distort, historical, memory, historian, john, spurr, writes, that, puritans, were, defined, by, their, relationships, with, their, surroundings, especially, with, the, church, of, england, whenever, the, church, of, england, changed, spurr, argues, the, definition, of, a, puritan, also, changed, the, analysis, of, mainstream, puritanism, in, terms, of, the, evolution, from, it, of, separatist, and, antinomian, groups, that, did, not, flourish, and, others, that, continue, to, this, day, such, as, baptists, and, quakers, can, suffer, in, this, way, the, national, context, england, and, wales, as, well, as, the, kingdoms, of, scotland, and, ireland, frames, the, definition, of, puritans, but, was, not, a, self, identification, for, those, protestants, who, saw, the, progress, of, the, thirty, years, war, from, 1620, as, directly, bearing, on, their, denomination, and, as, a, continuation, of, the, religious, wars, of, the, previous, century, carried, on, by, the, english, civil, wars, english, historian, christopher, hill, writes, of, the, 1630s, old, church, lands, and, the, accusations, that, william, laud, was, a, crypto, catholic, to,
