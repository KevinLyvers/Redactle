the, history, of, the, netherlands, extends, back, long, before, the, founding, of, the, modern, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, in, 1815, after, the, defeat, of, napoleon, for, thousands, of, years, people, have, been, living, together, around, the, river, deltas, of, this, section, of, the, north, sea, coast, records, begin, with, the, four, centuries, during, which, the, region, formed, a, militarized, border, zone, of, the, roman, empire, as, the, western, roman, empire, collapsed, and, the, middle, ages, began, three, dominant, germanic, peoples, coalesced, in, the, area, frisians, in, the, north, and, coastal, areas, low, saxons, in, the, northeast, in, addition, to, the, franks, in, the, south, by, 800, the, frankish, carolingian, dynasty, had, once, again, integrated, the, area, into, an, empire, covering, a, large, part, of, western, europe, the, region, was, part, of, the, duchy, of, lower, lotharingia, within, the, holy, roman, empire, but, neither, the, empire, nor, the, duchy, were, governed, in, a, centralized, manner, for, several, centuries, medieval, lordships, such, as, brabant, holland, zeeland, friesland, guelders, and, others, held, a, changing, patchwork, of, territories, by, 1433, the, duke, of, burgundy, had, assumed, control, over, most, of, lower, lotharingia, creating, the, burgundian, netherlands, this, included, what, is, now, the, netherlands, belgium, luxembourg, and, a, part, of, france, when, their, heirs, the, catholic, kings, of, spain, took, strong, measures, against, protestantism, the, subsequent, dutch, revolt, led, to, the, splitting, in, 1581, of, the, netherlands, into, southern, and, northern, parts, the, southern, spanish, netherlands, corresponds, approximately, to, modern, belgium, and, luxembourg, and, the, northern, united, provinces, or, dutch, republic, which, spoke, dutch, and, was, predominantly, protestant, was, the, predecessor, of, the, modern, netherlands, in, the, dutch, golden, age, which, had, its, zenith, around, 1667, there, was, a, flowering, of, trade, industry, and, the, sciences, the, dutch, republic, practiced, religious, toleration, and, amsterdam, attracted, portuguese, jews, many, of, whom, were, merchants, that, practiced, their, religion, and, engaged, in, economic, activity, a, rich, worldwide, dutch, empire, developed, in, asia, and, the, americas, the, dutch, east, india, company, based, on, its, english, counterpart, was, founded, during, the, eighteenth, century, the, power, wealth, and, influence, of, the, netherlands, declined, a, series, of, wars, with, the, more, powerful, british, and, french, neighbours, weakened, it, the, english, seized, the, north, american, colony, of, new, amsterdam, and, renamed, it, new, york, there, was, growing, unrest, and, conflict, between, the, orangists, and, the, patriots, the, french, revolution, spilled, over, after, 1789, and, a, pro, french, batavian, republic, was, established, in, 1795, 1806, napoleon, made, it, a, satellite, state, the, kingdom, of, holland, 1806, 1810, and, later, simply, a, french, imperial, province, after, the, defeat, of, napoleon, in, 1813, 1815, an, expanded, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, was, created, with, the, house, of, orange, as, monarchs, also, ruling, belgium, and, luxembourg, after, the, king, imposed, unpopular, protestant, reforms, on, belgium, it, left, the, kingdom, in, 1830, and, new, borders, were, agreed, in, 1839, after, an, initially, conservative, period, following, the, introduction, of, the, 1848, constitution, the, country, became, a, parliamentary, democracy, with, a, constitutional, monarch, modern, day, luxembourg, became, officially, independent, of, the, netherlands, in, 1839, but, a, personal, union, remained, until, 1890, since, 1890, it, is, ruled, by, another, branch, of, the, same, dynasty, the, netherlands, was, neutral, during, the, first, world, war, but, during, the, second, world, war, it, was, invaded, and, occupied, by, nazi, germany, the, nazis, including, many, collaborators, rounded, up, and, killed, almost, all, of, the, country, s, jewish, population, when, the, dutch, resistance, increased, the, nazis, cut, off, food, supplies, to, much, of, the, country, causing, severe, starvation, in, 1944, 1945, in, 1942, the, dutch, east, indies, were, conquered, by, japan, but, prior, to, this, the, dutch, destroyed, the, oil, wells, for, which, japan, was, desperate, indonesia, proclaimed, its, independence, from, the, netherlands, in, 1945, followed, by, suriname, in, 1975, the, post, war, years, saw, rapid, economic, recovery, helped, by, the, american, marshall, plan, followed, by, the, introduction, of, a, welfare, state, during, an, era, of, peace, and, prosperity, the, netherlands, formed, a, new, economic, alliance, with, belgium, and, luxembourg, the, benelux, and, all, three, became, founding, members, of, the, european, union, and, nato, in, recent, decades, the, dutch, economy, has, been, closely, linked, to, that, of, germany, and, is, highly, prosperous, the, four, countries, adopted, the, euro, on, 1, january, 2002, along, with, eight, other, eu, member, states, during, the, last, ice, age, the, netherlands, had, a, tundra, climate, with, scarce, vegetation, and, the, inhabitants, survived, as, hunter, gatherers, the, swifterbant, culture, appearing, around, 5600, bc, were, hunter, gatherers, strongly, linked, to, rivers, and, open, water, and, related, to, the, southern, scandinavian, erteb, lle, culture, agriculture, also, arrived, in, areas, near, the, netherlands, somewhere, around, 5000, bc, with, the, linear, pottery, culture, who, were, central, european, farmers, with, mediterranean, ancestry, their, farms, were, restricted, to, southern, limburg, and, only, temporarily, established, however, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, coastal, swifterband, people, took, up, pottery, and, animal, husbandry, in, the, rest, of, the, country, local, groups, made, the, switch, to, animal, husbandry, sometime, between, 4800, bc, and, 4500, bc, by, about, 4000, bc, the, funnelbeaker, culture, brought, farming, permanently, into, the, region, this, culture, extended, from, denmark, through, northern, germany, into, the, northern, netherlands, the, vlaardingen, culture, continued, the, hunter, gatherer, tradition, in, coastal, areas, by, around, 2950, bce, there, was, a, transition, from, the, funnelbeaker, farming, culture, to, the, corded, ware, culture, which, extended, across, much, of, northern, and, central, europe, the, expansion, of, this, culture, is, believed, to, have, involved, the, movement, of, people, from, the, direction, of, ukraine, bringing, indo, european, languages, and, copper, age, technology, the, earliest, bronze, tools, were, in, the, wageningen, horde, found, in, the, grave, of, a, bronze, age, metalworker, the, elp, culture, in, the, north, and, the, hilversum, culture, in, the, south, developed, during, the, bronze, age, with, the, latter, having, cultural, ties, with, britain, the, iron, age, brought, a, measure, of, prosperity, to, the, people, living, in, the, area, of, the, present, day, netherlands, with, iron, ore, available, throughout, the, country, smiths, travelled, from, small, settlement, to, settlement, with, bronze, and, iron, fabricating, tools, on, demand, including, axes, knives, pins, arrowheads, and, swords, the, vorstengraf, large, burial, mound, contained, a, number, of, objects, including, a, curved, iron, sword, leading, up, to, the, arrival, of, the, romans, the, probably, germanic, harpstedt, culture, rose, in, the, north, possibly, migrating, from, scandinavia, due, to, climatic, deterioration, which, had, separated, into, a, northern, group, that, would, later, become, early, frisians, and, early, saxons, and, a, southern, group, that, extended, into, the, rhine, which, eventually, developed, into, the, salian, franks, while, further, to, the, south, were, peoples, influenced, by, the, hallstatt, culture, who, eventually, assimilated, into, the, celtic, la, t, ne, culture, with, some, mixture, between, the, two, this, is, consistent, with, caesar, s, account, of, the, rhine, forming, the, boundary, between, celtic, and, germanic, tribes, some, scholars, have, speculated, that, a, separate, ethnic, identity, with, its, own, language, that, was, neither, germanic, nor, celtic, formed, a, nordwestblock, stretching, from, the, somme, to, the, weser, and, survived, until, the, roman, period, before, being, absorbed, by, their, celtic, and, germanic, neighbours, during, his, gallic, wars, julius, caesar, conquered, all, of, gaul, for, rome, and, this, included, the, netherlands, south, of, the, rhine, he, also, wrote, about, his, experiences, in, his, commentarii, de, bello, gallico, which, is, the, first, surviving, written, account, of, the, region, caesar, mentioned, the, menapii, living, in, the, river, delta, and, the, eburones, to, their, southeast, towards, what, is, now, limburg, he, called, the, land, between, the, rhine, and, waal, the, island, of, the, batavi, insula, batavorum, he, portrayed, the, rhine, as, a, natural, boundary, between, the, gauls, and, germanic, peoples, on, the, other, side, but, he, understood, that, peoples, such, as, the, eburones, had, a, kinship, with, their, neighbours, over, the, river, later, roman, authors, such, as, tacitus, and, pliny, the, elder, describe, the, region, north, of, the, rhine, being, inhabited, by, the, frisii, chamavi, and, tubantes, within, the, delta, lived, the, cananefates, batavians, sturii, marsacii, and, frisiavones, the, texuandri, baetasii, and, tungri, lived, south, of, the, delta, the, 450, years, of, roman, rule, profoundly, changed, the, region, that, would, later, become, the, netherlands, the, rhine, was, a, militarized, border, frequently, destabilized, by, violent, incursions, and, rome, recruited, soldiers, on, both, sides, of, it, the, tribes, of, the, region, were, esteemed, soldiers, in, the, empire, often, serving, in, the, roman, cavalry, the, frontier, culture, was, influenced, by, roman, germanic, and, gaulish, elements, and, trade, flourished, after, rome, s, conquest, of, gaul, there, were, still, grievances, against, roman, rule, including, the, taking, of, young, batavians, as, slaves, this, led, to, the, batavian, rebellion, under, gaius, julius, civilis, in, 69, ad, which, resulted, in, the, burning, of, several, roman, castellum, and, the, desertion, of, sections, of, the, northern, roman, army, in, april, 70, ad, legions, led, by, quintus, petillius, cerialis, defeated, the, rebels, the, batavians, were, considered, the, true, forefathers, of, the, dutch, by, 17th, and, 18th, century, writers, inspiring, the, naming, of, colonial, jakarta, as, batavia, in, 1619, and, the, batavian, republic, of, 1795, the, term, batavian, is, occasionally, used, to, describe, the, dutch, today, similar, to, how, gallic, describes, the, french, a, frankish, identity, emerged, in, the, lower, and, middle, rhine, valley, during, the, first, half, of, the, 3rd, century, forming, a, confederation, of, smaller, germanic, groups, including, the, descendants, of, the, batavian, rebels, the, frisii, probably, disappeared, from, the, northern, netherlands, with, the, last, reference, to, them, in, c, 296, likely, due, to, resettlement, to, other, areas, of, roman, control, and, coastal, flooding, as, climatic, conditions, improved, there, was, another, mass, migration, of, germanic, peoples, into, the, area, from, the, east, this, is, known, as, the, migration, period, volksverhuizingen, the, northern, netherlands, received, an, influx, of, new, migrants, and, settlers, mostly, saxons, but, also, angles, and, jutes, many, of, these, migrants, did, not, stay, in, the, northern, netherlands, but, moved, on, to, england, and, are, known, today, as, the, anglo, saxons, the, newcomers, who, stayed, in, the, northern, netherlands, would, eventually, be, referred, to, as, frisians, although, they, were, not, descended, from, the, ancient, frisii, these, new, frisians, settled, in, the, northern, netherlands, and, would, become, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, frisians, because, the, early, frisians, and, anglo, saxons, were, formed, from, largely, identical, tribal, confederacies, their, respective, languages, were, very, similar, old, frisian, is, the, most, closely, related, language, to, old, english, and, the, modern, frisian, dialects, are, in, turn, the, closest, related, languages, to, contemporary, english, by, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, the, frisian, territory, in, the, northern, netherlands, had, expanded, west, to, the, north, sea, coast, and, by, the, 7th, century, south, to, dorestad, during, this, period, most, of, the, northern, netherlands, was, known, as, frisia, this, extended, frisian, territory, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, frisia, magna, or, greater, frisia, in, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, the, frankish, chronologies, mention, this, area, as, the, kingdom, of, the, frisians, this, kingdom, comprised, the, coastal, provinces, of, the, netherlands, and, the, german, north, sea, coast, during, this, time, the, frisian, language, was, spoken, along, the, entire, southern, north, sea, coast, the, 7th, century, frisian, kingdom, 650, 734, under, king, aldegisel, and, king, redbad, had, its, centre, of, power, in, utrecht, dorestad, was, the, largest, settlement, emporia, in, northwestern, europe, it, had, grown, around, a, former, roman, fortress, it, was, a, large, flourishing, trading, place, three, kilometers, long, and, situated, where, the, rivers, rhine, and, lek, diverge, southeast, of, utrecht, near, the, modern, town, of, wijk, bij, duurstede, although, inland, it, was, a, north, sea, trading, centre, that, primarily, handled, goods, from, the, middle, rhineland, wine, was, among, the, major, products, traded, at, dorestad, likely, from, vineyards, south, of, mainz, it, was, also, widely, known, because, of, its, mint, between, 600, and, around, 719, dorestad, was, often, fought, over, between, the, frisians, and, the, franks, after, roman, government, in, the, area, collapsed, the, franks, expanded, their, territories, until, there, were, numerous, small, frankish, kingdoms, especially, at, cologne, tournai, le, mans, and, cambrai, the, kings, of, tournai, eventually, came, to, subdue, the, other, frankish, kings, by, the, 490s, clovis, i, had, conquered, and, united, all, the, frankish, territories, to, the, west, of, the, meuse, including, those, in, the, southern, netherlands, he, continued, his, conquests, into, gaul, after, the, death, of, clovis, i, in, 511, his, four, sons, partitioned, his, kingdom, amongst, themselves, with, theuderic, i, receiving, the, lands, that, were, to, become, austrasia, including, the, southern, netherlands, a, line, of, kings, descended, from, theuderic, ruled, austrasia, until, 555, when, it, was, united, with, the, other, frankish, kingdoms, of, chlothar, i, who, inherited, all, the, frankish, realms, by, 558, he, redivided, the, frankish, territory, amongst, his, four, sons, but, the, four, kingdoms, coalesced, into, three, on, the, death, of, charibert, i, in, 567, austrasia, including, the, southern, netherlands, was, given, to, sigebert, i, the, southern, netherlands, remained, the, northern, part, of, austrasia, until, the, rise, of, the, carolingians, the, franks, who, expanded, south, into, gaul, settled, there, and, eventually, adopted, the, vulgar, latin, of, the, local, population, however, a, germanic, language, was, spoken, as, a, second, tongue, by, public, officials, in, western, austrasia, and, neustria, as, late, as, the, 850s, it, completely, disappeared, as, a, spoken, language, from, these, regions, during, the, 10th, century, during, this, expansion, to, the, south, many, frankish, people, remained, in, the, north, i, e, southern, netherlands, flanders, and, a, small, part, of, northern, france, a, widening, cultural, divide, grew, between, the, franks, remaining, in, the, north, and, the, rulers, far, to, the, south, in, what, is, now, france, salian, franks, continued, to, reside, in, their, original, homeland, and, the, area, directly, to, the, south, and, to, speak, their, original, language, old, frankish, which, by, the, 9th, century, had, evolved, into, old, dutch, a, dutch, french, language, boundary, came, into, existence, but, this, was, originally, south, of, where, it, is, today, in, the, maas, and, rhine, areas, of, the, netherlands, the, franks, had, political, and, trading, centres, especially, at, nijmegen, and, maastricht, these, franks, remained, in, contact, with, the, frisians, to, the, north, especially, in, places, like, dorestad, and, utrecht, in, the, 19th, century, dutch, historians, believed, that, the, franks, frisians, and, saxons, had, populated, and, inhabited, the, low, countries, but, this, theory, fell, out, of, favour, in, the, 20th, century, due, to, the, scarcity, of, written, sources, knowledge, of, this, period, depends, to, a, large, degree, on, the, interpretation, of, archaeological, data, the, traditional, view, of, a, clear, cut, division, between, frisians, in, the, north, and, coast, franks, in, the, south, and, saxons, in, the, east, has, proven, historically, problematic, archeological, evidence, suggests, dramatically, different, models, for, different, regions, with, demographic, continuity, for, some, parts, of, the, country, and, depopulation, and, possible, replacement, in, other, parts, notably, the, coastal, areas, of, frisia, and, holland, the, language, from, which, old, dutch, arose, is, unknown, with, certainty, but, it, is, thought, to, be, the, language, spoken, by, the, salian, franks, even, though, the, franks, are, traditionally, categorized, as, weser, rhine, germanic, dutch, has, a, number, of, ingvaeonic, characteristics, and, is, classified, by, modern, linguists, as, an, ingvaeonic, language, dutch, also, has, a, number, of, old, saxon, characteristics, there, was, a, close, relationship, between, old, dutch, old, saxon, old, english, and, old, frisian, because, texts, written, in, the, language, spoken, by, the, franks, are, almost, non, existent, and, old, dutch, texts, scarce, and, fragmentary, not, much, is, known, about, the, development, of, old, dutch, old, dutch, made, the, transition, to, middle, dutch, around, 1150, the, christianity, that, arrived, in, the, netherlands, with, the, romans, appears, not, to, have, died, out, completely, in, maastricht, at, least, after, the, withdrawal, of, the, romans, in, about, 411, the, franks, became, christians, after, their, king, clovis, i, converted, to, catholicism, an, event, which, is, traditionally, set, in, 496, christianity, was, introduced, in, the, north, after, the, conquest, of, friesland, by, the, franks, the, saxons, in, the, east, were, converted, before, the, conquest, of, saxony, and, became, frankish, allies, hiberno, scottish, and, anglo, saxon, missionaries, particularly, willibrord, wulfram, and, boniface, played, an, important, role, in, converting, the, frankish, and, frisian, peoples, to, christianity, by, the, 8th, century, boniface, was, martyred, by, the, frisians, in, dokkum, 754, in, the, early, 8th, century, the, frisians, came, increasingly, into, conflict, with, the, franks, to, the, south, resulting, in, a, series, of, wars, in, which, the, frankish, empire, eventually, subjugated, frisia, in, 734, at, the, battle, of, the, boarn, the, frisians, in, the, netherlands, were, defeated, by, the, franks, who, thereby, conquered, the, area, west, of, the, lauwers, the, franks, then, conquered, the, area, east, of, the, lauwers, in, 785, when, charlemagne, defeated, widukind, the, linguistic, descendants, of, the, franks, the, modern, dutch, speakers, of, the, netherlands, and, flanders, seem, to, have, broken, with, the, endonym, frank, around, the, 9th, century, by, this, time, frankish, identity, had, changed, from, an, ethnic, identity, to, a, national, identity, becoming, localized, and, confined, to, the, modern, franconia, and, principally, to, the, french, province, of, le, de, france, although, the, people, no, longer, referred, to, themselves, as, franks, the, netherlands, was, still, part, of, the, frankish, empire, of, charlemagne, indeed, because, of, the, austrasian, origins, of, the, carolingians, in, the, area, between, the, rhine, and, the, maas, the, cities, of, aachen, maastricht, li, ge, and, nijmegen, were, at, the, heart, of, carolingian, culture, charlemagne, maintained, his, palatium, in, nijmegen, at, least, four, times, the, carolingian, empire, would, eventually, include, france, germany, northern, italy, and, much, of, western, europe, in, 843, the, frankish, empire, was, divided, into, three, parts, giving, rise, to, west, francia, in, the, west, east, francia, in, the, east, and, middle, francia, in, the, centre, most, of, what, is, today, the, netherlands, became, part, of, middle, francia, flanders, became, part, of, west, francia, this, division, was, an, important, factor, in, the, historical, distinction, between, flanders, and, the, other, dutch, speaking, areas, middle, francia, latin, francia, media, was, an, ephemeral, frankish, kingdom, that, had, no, historical, or, ethnic, identity, to, bind, its, varied, peoples, it, was, created, by, the, treaty, of, verdun, in, 843, which, divided, the, carolingian, empire, among, the, sons, of, louis, the, pious, situated, between, the, realms, of, east, and, west, francia, middle, francia, comprised, the, frankish, territory, between, the, rivers, rhine, and, scheldt, the, frisian, coast, of, the, north, sea, the, former, kingdom, of, burgundy, except, for, a, western, portion, later, known, as, bourgogne, provence, and, the, kingdom, of, italy, middle, francia, fell, to, lothair, i, the, eldest, son, and, successor, of, louis, the, pious, after, an, intermittent, civil, war, with, his, younger, brothers, louis, the, german, and, charles, the, bald, in, acknowledgement, of, lothair, s, imperial, title, middle, francia, contained, the, imperial, cities, of, aachen, the, residence, of, charlemagne, as, well, as, rome, in, 855, on, his, deathbed, at, pr, m, abbey, emperor, lothair, i, again, partitioned, his, realm, amongst, his, sons, most, of, the, lands, north, of, the, alps, including, the, netherlands, passed, to, lothair, ii, and, consecutively, were, named, lotharingia, after, lothair, ii, died, in, 869, lotharingia, was, partitioned, by, his, uncles, louis, the, german, and, charles, the, bald, in, the, treaty, of, meerssen, in, 870, although, some, of, the, netherlands, had, come, under, viking, control, in, 870, it, technically, became, part, of, east, francia, which, became, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 962, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, the, vikings, raided, the, largely, defenceless, frisian, and, frankish, towns, lying, on, the, coast, and, along, the, rivers, of, the, low, countries, although, vikings, never, settled, in, large, numbers, in, those, areas, they, did, set, up, long, term, bases, and, were, even, acknowledged, as, lords, in, a, few, cases, in, dutch, and, frisian, historical, tradition, the, trading, centre, of, dorestad, declined, after, viking, raids, from, 834, to, 863, however, since, no, convincing, viking, archaeological, evidence, has, been, found, at, the, site, as, of, 2007, doubts, about, this, have, grown, in, recent, years, one, of, the, most, important, viking, families, in, the, low, countries, was, that, of, rorik, of, dorestad, based, in, wieringen, and, his, brother, the, younger, harald, based, in, walcheren, both, thought, to, be, nephews, of, harald, klak, around, 850, lothair, i, acknowledged, rorik, as, ruler, of, most, of, friesland, and, again, in, 870, rorik, was, received, by, charles, the, bald, in, nijmegen, to, whom, he, became, a, vassal, viking, raids, continued, during, that, period, harald, s, son, rodulf, and, his, men, were, killed, by, the, people, of, oostergo, in, 873, rorik, died, sometime, before, 882, buried, viking, treasures, consisting, mainly, of, silver, have, been, found, in, the, low, countries, two, such, treasures, have, been, found, in, wieringen, a, large, treasure, found, in, wieringen, in, 1996, dates, from, around, 850, and, is, thought, perhaps, to, have, been, connected, to, rorik, the, burial, of, such, a, valuable, treasure, is, seen, as, an, indication, that, there, was, a, permanent, settlement, in, wieringen, around, 879, godfrid, arrived, in, frisian,

controlling, most, of, frisia, between, 882, and, his, death, in, 885, godfrid, became, known, to, history, as, godfrid, duke, of, frisia, his, lordship, over, frisia, was, acknowledged, by, charles, the, fat, to, whom, he, became, a, vassal, godfried, was, assassinated, in, 885, after, which, gerolf, of, holland, assumed, lordship, and, viking, rule, of, frisia, came, to, an, end, viking, raids, of, the, low, countries, continued, for, over, a, century, remains, of, viking, attacks, dating, from, 880, to, 890, have, been, found, in, zutphen, and, deventer, in, 920, king, henry, of, germany, liberated, utrecht, according, to, a, number, of, chronicles, the, last, attacks, took, place, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 11th, century, and, were, directed, at, tiel, and, or, utrecht, these, viking, raids, occurred, about, the, same, time, that, french, and, german, lords, were, fighting, for, supremacy, over, the, middle, empire, that, included, the, netherlands, so, their, sway, over, this, area, was, weak, resistance, to, the, vikings, if, any, came, from, local, nobles, who, gained, in, stature, as, a, result, the, german, kings, and, emperors, ruled, the, netherlands, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, century, with, the, assistance, of, the, dukes, of, lotharingia, and, the, bishops, of, utrecht, and, li, ge, germany, was, called, the, holy, roman, empire, after, the, coronation, of, king, otto, the, great, as, emperor, the, dutch, city, of, nijmegen, used, to, be, the, spot, of, an, important, domain, of, the, german, emperors, several, german, emperors, were, born, and, died, there, including, for, example, byzantine, empress, theophanu, who, died, in, nijmegen, utrecht, was, also, an, important, city, and, trading, port, at, the, time, the, holy, roman, empire, was, not, able, to, maintain, political, unity, in, addition, to, the, growing, independence, of, the, towns, local, rulers, turned, their, counties, and, duchies, into, private, kingdoms, and, felt, little, sense, of, obligation, to, the, emperor, who, reigned, over, large, parts, of, the, nation, in, name, only, large, parts, of, what, now, comprise, the, netherlands, were, governed, by, the, count, of, holland, the, duke, of, gelre, the, duke, of, brabant, and, the, bishop, of, utrecht, friesland, and, groningen, in, the, north, maintained, their, independence, and, were, governed, by, the, lower, nobility, the, various, feudal, states, were, in, a, state, of, almost, continual, war, gelre, and, holland, fought, for, control, of, utrecht, utrecht, whose, bishop, had, in, 1000, ruled, over, half, of, what, is, today, the, netherlands, was, marginalised, as, it, experienced, continuing, difficulty, in, electing, new, bishops, at, the, same, time, the, dynasties, of, neighbouring, states, were, more, stable, groningen, drenthe, and, most, of, gelre, which, used, to, be, part, of, utrecht, became, independent, brabant, tried, to, conquer, its, neighbours, but, was, not, successful, holland, also, tried, to, assert, itself, in, zeeland, and, friesland, but, its, attempts, failed, the, language, and, culture, of, most, of, the, people, who, lived, in, the, area, that, is, now, holland, were, originally, frisian, the, sparsely, populated, area, was, known, as, west, friesland, westfriesland, a, common, theory, states, that, frankish, migration, from, either, flanders, utrecht, or, both, displaced, the, frisians, in, holland, however, no, evidence, has, been, found, in, support, of, this, theory, and, more, recent, studies, have, suggested, that, frisians, from, the, mouth, of, the, rhine, adopted, the, franconian, language, feudal, system, and, religion, spreading, this, new, hollandic, identity, northward, over, the, centuries, the, part, of, north, holland, situated, north, of, alkmaar, is, still, colloquially, known, as, west, friesland, the, rest, of, friesland, in, the, north, continued, to, maintain, its, independence, during, this, time, it, had, its, own, institutions, collectively, called, the, frisian, freedom, and, resented, the, imposition, of, the, feudal, system, and, the, patriciate, found, in, other, european, towns, they, regarded, themselves, as, allies, of, switzerland, the, frisian, battle, cry, was, better, dead, than, a, slave, they, later, lost, their, independence, when, they, were, defeated, in, 1498, by, the, german, landsknecht, mercenaries, of, duke, albrecht, of, saxony, meissen, the, center, of, power, in, these, emerging, independent, territories, was, in, the, county, of, holland, originally, granted, as, a, fief, to, the, danish, chieftain, rorik, in, return, for, loyalty, to, the, emperor, in, 862, the, region, of, kennemara, the, region, around, modern, haarlem, rapidly, grew, under, rorik, s, descendants, in, size, and, importance, by, the, early, 11th, century, dirk, iii, count, of, holland, was, levying, tolls, on, the, meuse, estuary, and, was, able, to, resist, military, intervention, from, his, overlord, the, duke, of, lower, lorraine, in, 1083, the, name, holland, first, appears, in, a, deed, referring, to, a, region, corresponding, more, or, less, to, the, current, province, of, south, holland, and, the, southern, half, of, what, is, now, north, holland, holland, s, influence, continued, to, grow, over, the, next, two, centuries, the, counts, of, holland, conquered, most, of, zeeland, but, it, was, not, until, 1289, that, count, floris, v, was, able, to, subjugate, the, frisians, in, west, friesland, that, is, the, northern, half, of, north, holland, around, 1000, c, e, there, were, several, agricultural, developments, described, sometimes, as, an, agricultural, revolution, that, resulted, in, an, increase, in, production, especially, food, production, the, economy, started, to, develop, at, a, fast, pace, and, the, higher, productivity, allowed, workers, to, farm, more, land, or, to, become, tradesmen, draining, of, low, lying, swampy, areas, and, flood, control, was, expanded, significantly, after, 1200, ce, before, that, towns, were, built, north, of, the, major, rivers, utrecht, kampen, deventer, zwolle, nijmegen, and, zutphen, but, with, the, expansion, of, dikes, and, drainage, cultivable, land, was, created, and, population, expanded, in, this, period, holland, expanded, relative, to, the, other, regions, from, the, thirteenth, century, onwards, the, necessity, of, controlling, water, in, this, northern, was, a, given, transforming, the, physical, environment, but, also, requiring, institutions, and, cooperation, between, areas, for, water, management, drainage, boards, heemraadschappen, were, established, and, the, dike, count, took, on, responsibilities, not, only, for, water, management, issues, but, also, fiscal, policing, and, judicial, functions, by, the, end, of, the, thirteenth, century, holland, emerged, in, the, dominant, position, of, the, northern, region, the, southern, low, countries, remained, highly, populous, and, developed, and, was, among, the, most, highly, urbanized, areas, in, europe, because, of, the, east, west, flow, of, the, low, countries, large, rivers, they, were, a, military, and, political, barrier, between, north, and, south, the, southern, low, countries, could, not, exert, influence, over, the, north, this, division, meant, that, the, counts, of, holland, became, politically, important, in, the, north, holland, extended, its, political, power, over, zeeland, the, crusades, were, popular, in, the, low, countries, and, drew, many, to, fight, in, the, holy, land, at, home, there, was, relative, peace, viking, pillaging, had, stopped, both, the, crusades, and, the, relative, peace, at, home, contributed, to, trade, and, the, growth, in, commerce, cities, arose, and, flourished, especially, in, flanders, and, brabant, as, the, cities, grew, in, wealth, and, power, they, started, to, buy, certain, privileges, for, themselves, from, the, sovereign, including, city, rights, the, right, to, self, government, and, the, right, to, pass, laws, in, practice, this, meant, that, the, wealthiest, cities, became, quasi, independent, republics, in, their, own, right, two, of, the, most, important, cities, were, bruges, and, antwerp, in, flanders, which, would, later, develop, into, some, of, the, most, important, cities, and, ports, in, europe, the, hook, and, cod, wars, dutch, hoekse, en, kabeljauwse, twisten, were, a, series, of, wars, and, battles, in, the, county, of, holland, between, 1350, and, 1490, most, of, these, wars, were, fought, over, the, title, of, count, of, holland, but, some, have, argued, that, the, underlying, reason, was, because, of, the, power, struggle, of, the, traders, in, the, cities, against, the, ruling, nobility, the, cod, faction, generally, consisted, of, the, more, progressive, cities, of, holland, the, hook, faction, consisted, for, a, large, part, of, the, conservative, noblemen, some, of, the, main, figures, in, this, multi, generational, conflict, were, william, iv, margaret, william, v, william, vi, count, of, holland, and, hainaut, john, and, philip, the, good, duke, of, burgundy, but, perhaps, the, most, well, known, is, jacqueline, countess, of, hainaut, the, conquest, of, the, county, of, holland, by, the, duke, philip, the, good, of, burgundy, was, an, odd, affair, leading, noblemen, in, holland, invited, the, duke, to, conquer, holland, even, though, he, had, no, historical, claim, to, it, some, historians, say, that, the, ruling, class, in, holland, wanted, holland, to, integrate, with, the, flemish, economic, system, and, adopt, flemish, legal, institutions, europe, had, been, wracked, by, many, civil, wars, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, while, flanders, had, grown, rich, and, enjoyed, peace, most, of, what, is, now, the, netherlands, and, belgium, was, eventually, united, by, the, duke, of, burgundy, phillip, the, good, 1396, 1467, before, the, burgundian, union, the, dutch, identified, themselves, by, the, town, they, lived, in, their, local, duchy, or, county, or, as, subjects, of, the, holy, roman, empire, these, collections, of, fiefs, were, ruled, under, the, personal, union, of, the, house, of, valois, burgundy, trade, in, the, region, developed, rapidly, especially, in, the, areas, of, shipping, and, transport, the, new, rulers, defended, dutch, trading, interests, amsterdam, grew, and, in, the, 15th, century, became, the, primary, trading, port, in, europe, for, grain, from, the, baltic, region, amsterdam, distributed, grain, to, the, major, cities, of, belgium, northern, france, and, england, this, trade, was, vital, to, the, people, of, the, region, as, they, could, no, longer, produce, enough, grain, to, feed, themselves, land, drainage, had, caused, the, peat, of, the, former, wetlands, to, reduce, to, a, level, that, was, too, low, for, drainage, to, be, maintained, charles, v, 1500, 1558, was, born, and, raised, in, the, flemish, city, of, ghent, he, spoke, french, charles, extended, the, burgundian, territory, with, the, annexation, of, tournai, artois, utrecht, groningen, and, guelders, to, create, the, seventeen, provinces, the, towns, of, the, region, had, already, been, unified, by, charles, s, burgundian, ancestors, but, were, nominally, fiefs, of, either, france, or, the, holy, roman, empire, when, he, was, a, minor, his, aunt, margaret, acted, as, regent, until, 1515, france, relinquished, its, ancient, claim, on, flanders, in, 1528, from, 1515, to, 1523, charles, s, government, in, the, netherlands, had, to, contend, with, the, rebellion, of, frisian, peasants, led, by, pier, gerlofs, donia, and, wijard, jelckama, gelre, attempted, to, build, up, its, own, state, in, northeast, netherlands, and, northwest, germany, lacking, funds, in, the, 16th, century, gelre, had, soldiers, provide, for, themselves, by, pillaging, enemy, lands, these, soldiers, were, a, great, menace, to, the, habsburg, netherlands, as, when, they, pillaged, the, hague, the, dukes, of, burgundy, over, the, years, through, astute, marriages, purchases, and, wars, had, taken, control, of, the, seventeen, provinces, that, made, up, the, low, countries, they, are, now, the, netherlands, in, the, north, the, southern, netherlands, now, belgium, in, the, south, and, luxemburg, in, the, southeast, known, as, the, burgundian, circle, these, lands, came, under, the, control, of, the, habsburg, family, charles, became, the, ruler, in, 1506, but, in, 1515, he, left, the, territory, to, become, king, of, spain, and, later, holy, roman, emperor, charles, turned, over, control, to, regents, his, close, relatives, and, in, practice, the, rule, over, the, low, countries, were, exercised, by, the, spaniards, under, his, authority, the, provinces, each, had, their, own, governments, and, courts, controlled, by, the, local, nobility, and, their, own, traditions, and, rights, liberties, dating, back, centuries, likewise, the, numerous, cities, had, their, own, legal, rights, and, local, governments, usually, controlled, by, the, merchants, on, top, of, this, the, spanish, had, imposed, a, somewhat, centralized, government, the, estates, general, of, the, netherlands, with, its, own, officials, and, courts, the, spanish, officials, sent, by, charles, ignored, traditions, and, the, dutch, nobility, as, well, as, local, officials, inciting, an, anti, spanish, sense, of, nationalism, which, led, to, the, dutch, revolt, with, the, emergence, of, the, protestant, reformation, charles, now, the, emperor, was, determined, to, crush, protestantism, unrest, began, in, the, south, centered, in, the, large, rich, metropolis, of, antwerp, the, netherlands, was, an, especially, rich, unit, of, the, spanish, realm, especially, after, the, treaty, of, cateau, cambr, sis, of, 1559, it, ended, four, decades, of, warfare, between, france, and, spain, and, allowed, spain, to, reposition, its, army, in, 1548, charles, granted, the, netherlands, status, as, an, entity, in, which, many, of, the, laws, of, the, holy, roman, empire, became, obsolete, the, transaction, of, augsburg, created, the, burgundian, circle, of, the, holy, roman, empire, which, comprised, the, netherlands, and, franche, comt, a, year, later, the, pragmatic, sanction, of, 1549, stated, that, the, seventeen, provinces, could, only, be, passed, on, to, his, heirs, as, a, composite, entity, during, the, 16th, century, the, protestant, reformation, rapidly, gained, ground, in, northern, europe, especially, in, its, lutheran, and, calvinist, forms, dutch, protestants, after, initial, repression, were, tolerated, by, local, authorities, by, the, 1560s, the, protestant, community, had, become, a, significant, influence, in, the, netherlands, although, it, clearly, formed, a, minority, then, in, a, society, dependent, on, trade, freedom, and, tolerance, were, considered, essential, nevertheless, the, catholic, rulers, charles, v, and, later, philip, ii, made, it, their, mission, to, defeat, protestantism, which, was, considered, a, heresy, by, the, catholic, church, and, a, threat, to, the, stability, of, the, whole, hierarchical, political, system, on, the, other, hand, the, intensely, moralistic, dutch, protestants, insisted, their, biblical, theology, sincere, piety, and, humble, lifestyle, was, morally, superior, to, the, luxurious, habits, and, superficial, religiosity, of, the, ecclesiastical, nobility, the, rulers, harsh, punitive, measures, led, to, increasing, grievances, in, the, netherlands, where, the, local, governments, had, embarked, on, a, course, of, peaceful, coexistence, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, the, situation, escalated, philip, sent, troops, to, crush, the, rebellion, and, make, the, netherlands, once, more, a, catholic, region, in, the, first, wave, of, the, reformation, lutheranism, won, over, the, elites, in, antwerp, and, the, south, the, spanish, successfully, suppressed, it, there, and, lutheranism, only, flourished, in, east, friesland, the, second, wave, of, the, reformation, came, in, the, form, of, anabaptism, that, was, popular, among, ordinary, farmers, in, holland, and, friesland, anabaptists, were, socially, very, radical, and, equalitarian, they, believed, that, the, apocalypse, was, very, near, they, refused, to, live, the, old, way, and, began, new, communities, creating, considerable, chaos, a, prominent, dutch, anabaptist, was, menno, simons, who, initiated, the, mennonite, church, the, movement, was, allowed, in, the, north, but, never, grew, to, a, large, scale, the, third, wave, of, the, reformation, that, ultimately, proved, to, be, permanent, was, calvinism, it, arrived, in, the, netherlands, in, the, 1540s, attracting, both, the, elite, and, the, common, population, especially, in, flanders, the, catholic, spanish, responded, with, harsh, persecution, and, introduced, the, inquisition, of, the, netherlands, calvinists, rebelled, first, there, was, the, iconoclasm, in, 1566, which, was, the, systematic, destruction, of, statues, of, saints, and, other, catholic, devotional, depictions, in, churches, in, 1566, william, the, silent, a, calvinist, started, the, eighty, years, war, to, liberate, all, dutch, of, whatever, religion, from, catholic, spain, blum, says, his, patience, tolerance, determination, concern, for, his, people, and, belief, in, government, by, consent, held, the, dutch, together, and, kept, alive, their, spirit, of, revolt, the, provinces, of, holland, and, zeeland, being, mainly, calvinist, by, 1572, submitted, to, the, rule, of, william, the, other, states, remained, almost, entirely, catholic, the, netherlands, was, a, valuable, part, of, the, spanish, empire, especially, after, the, treaty, of, cateau, cambresis, of, 1559, this, treaty, ended, a, forty, year, period, of, warfare, between, france, and, spain, conducted, in, italy, from, 1521, to, 1559, the, treaty, of, cateau, cambresis, was, somewhat, of, a, watershed, not, only, for, the, battleground, that, italy, had, been, but, also, for, northern, europe, spain, had, been, keeping, troops, in, the, netherlands, to, be, ready, to, attack, france, from, the, north, as, well, as, from, the, south, with, the, settlement, of, so, many, major, issues, between, france, and, spain, by, the, treaty, of, cateau, cambresis, there, was, no, longer, any, reason, to, keep, spanish, troops, in, the, netherlands, thus, the, people, of, the, netherlands, could, get, on, with, their, peacetime, pursuits, as, they, did, so, they, found, that, there, was, a, great, deal, of, demand, for, their, products, fishing, had, long, been, an, important, part, of, the, economy, of, the, netherlands, however, now, the, fishing, of, herring, alone, came, to, occupy, 2, 000, boats, operating, out, of, dutch, ports, spain, still, the, dutch, trader, s, best, customer, was, buying, fifty, large, ships, full, of, furniture, and, household, utensils, from, flanders, merchants, additionally, dutch, woolen, goods, were, desired, everywhere, the, netherlands, bought, and, processed, enough, spanish, wool, to, sell, four, million, florins, of, wool, products, through, merchants, in, bruges, so, strong, was, the, dutch, appetite, for, raw, wool, at, this, time, that, they, bought, nearly, as, much, english, wool, as, they, did, spanish, wool, total, commerce, with, england, alone, amounted, to, 24, million, florins, much, of, the, export, going, to, england, resulted, in, pure, profit, to, the, dutch, because, the, exported, items, were, of, their, own, manufacture, the, netherlands, was, just, starting, to, enter, its, golden, age, brabant, and, flanders, were, the, richest, and, most, flourishing, parts, of, the, dutch, republic, at, the, time, the, netherlands, was, one, of, the, richest, places, in, the, world, the, population, reached, 3, million, in, 1560, with, 25, cities, of, 10, 000, people, or, more, by, far, the, largest, urban, presence, in, europe, with, the, trading, and, financial, center, of, antwerp, being, especially, important, population, 100, 000, spain, could, not, afford, to, lose, this, rich, land, nor, allow, it, to, fall, from, catholic, control, thus, came, 80, years, of, warfare, a, devout, catholic, philip, was, appalled, by, the, success, of, the, reformation, in, the, low, countries, which, had, led, to, an, increasing, number, of, calvinists, his, attempts, to, enforce, religious, persecution, of, the, protestants, and, his, centralization, of, government, law, enforcement, and, taxes, made, him, unpopular, and, led, to, a, revolt, fernando, alvarez, de, toledo, duke, of, alba, was, sent, with, a, spanish, army, to, punish, the, unruly, dutch, in, 1567, the, only, opposition, the, duke, of, alba, faced, in, his, march, across, the, netherlands, were, the, nobles, lamoral, count, of, egmont, philippe, de, montmorency, count, of, horn, and, others, with, the, approach, of, alba, and, the, spanish, army, william, the, silent, of, orange, fled, to, germany, with, his, three, brothers, and, his, whole, family, on, 11, april, 1567, the, duke, of, alba, sought, to, meet, and, negotiate, with, the, nobles, that, now, faced, him, with, armies, however, when, the, nobles, arrived, in, brussels, they, were, all, arrested, and, egmont, and, horn, were, executed, alba, then, revoked, all, the, prior, treaties, that, margaret, the, duchess, of, parma, had, signed, with, the, protestants, of, the, netherlands, and, instituted, the, inquisition, to, enforce, the, decrees, of, the, council, of, trent, the, dutch, war, for, independence, from, spain, is, frequently, called, the, eighty, years, war, 1568, 1648, the, first, fifty, years, 1568, through, 1618, were, a, war, solely, between, catholic, spain, and, the, protestant, rebels, of, the, netherlands, it, was, a, military, conflict, with, integral, religious, elements, during, the, last, thirty, years, 1618, 1648, the, conflict, between, spain, and, the, netherlands, was, submerged, in, the, general, european, war, that, became, known, as, the, thirty, years, war, the, seven, rebellious, provinces, of, the, netherlands, were, eventually, united, by, the, union, of, utrecht, in, 1579, and, formed, the, republic, of, the, seven, united, netherlands, also, known, as, the, united, provinces, the, act, of, abjuration, or, plakkaat, van, verlatinghe, was, signed, on, 26, july, 1581, and, was, the, formal, declaration, of, independence, of, the, northern, low, countries, from, the, spanish, king, religious, toleration, was, a, key, element, of, protestant, ideology, william, of, orange, 1533, 1584, the, founder, of, the, dutch, royal, family, led, the, dutch, during, the, first, part, of, the, war, the, very, first, years, were, a, success, for, the, spanish, troops, however, the, dutch, countered, subsequent, sieges, in, holland, in, november, and, december, 1572, all, the, citizens, of, zutphen, and, naarden, were, slaughtered, by, the, spanish, from, 11, december, that, year, the, city, of, haarlem, was, besieged, holding, out, for, seven, months, until, 13, july, 1573, oudewater, was, conquered, by, the, spanish, on, 7, august, 1575, and, most, of, its, inhabitants, were, killed, maastricht, was, besieged, sacked, and, destroyed, twice, in, succession, in, 1576, and, 1579, by, the, spanish, in, a, war, largely, of, sieges, rather, than, battles, governor, general, alexander, farnese, proved, his, mettle, his, strategy, was, to, offer, generous, terms, for, the, surrender, of, a, city, there, would, be, no, more, massacres, or, looting, historic, urban, privileges, were, retained, there, was, a, full, pardon, and, amnesty, return, to, the, catholic, church, would, be, gradual, conservative, catholics, in, the, south, and, east, supported, the, spanish, farnese, recaptured, antwerp, and, nearly, all, of, what, became, belgium, most, of, the, dutch, speaking, territory, in, the, netherlands, was, taken, from, spain, but, not, in, flanders, which, to, this, day, remains, part, of, belgium, flanders, was, the, most, radical, anti, spanish, territory, many, flemish, fled, to, holland, among, them, half, of, the, population, of, antwerp, 3, 4, of, bruges, and, ghent, and, the, entire, population, of, nieuwpoort, dunkerque, and, countryside, his, successful, campaign, gave, the, catholics, control, of, the, lower, half, of, the, low, countries, and, was, part, of, the, catholic, counter, reformation, the, war, dragged, on, for, another, half, century, but, the, main, fighting, was, over, the, peace, of, westphalia, signed, in, 1648, confirmed, the, independence, of, the, united, provinces, from, spain, the, dutch, people, started, to, develop, a, national, identity, beginning, in, the, 15th,

established, ports, in, dutch, occupied, malabar, leading, to, dutch, settlements, and, trading, posts, in, india, however, their, expansion, into, india, was, halted, after, their, defeat, in, the, battle, of, colachel, by, the, kingdom, of, travancore, during, the, travancore, dutch, war, the, dutch, never, recovered, from, the, defeat, and, no, longer, posed, a, large, colonial, threat, to, india, eventually, the, 18th, century, saw, the, dutch, east, india, company, weighted, down, by, corruption, and, the, voc, eventually, went, bankrupt, in, 1800, its, possessions, were, taken, over, by, the, government, and, turned, into, the, dutch, east, indies, in, 1647, a, dutch, vessel, was, wrecked, in, the, present, day, table, bay, at, cape, town, the, marooned, crew, the, first,

stock, up, on, fresh, supplies, of, meat, fruit, and, vegetables, to, this, end, a, small, voc, expedition, under, the, command, of, jan, van, riebeeck, reached, table, bay, on, 6, april, 1652, to, remedy, a, labour, shortage, the, voc, released, a, small, number, of, voc, employees, from, their, contracts, and, permitted, them, to, establish, farms, with, which, they, would, supply, the, voc, settlement, from, their, harvests, this, arrangement, proved, highly, successful, producing, abundant, supplies, of, fruit, vegetables, wheat, and, wine, they, also, later, raised, livestock, the, small, initial, group, of, free, burghers, as, these, farmers, were, known, steadily, increased, in, number, and, began, to, expand, their, farms, further, north, and, east, the, majority, of, burghers, had, dutch, ancestry, and, belonged, to, the, calvinist, reformed, church, of, the, netherlands, but, there, were, also, numerous, germans, as, well, as, some, scandinavians, in, 1688, the, dutch, and, the, germans, were, joined, by, french, huguenots, also, calvinists, who, were, fleeing, religious, persecution, in, france, under, king, louis, xiv, the, huguenots, in, south, africa, were, absorbed, into, the, dutch, population, but, they, played, a, prominent, role, in, south, africa, s, history, from, the, beginning, the, voc, used, the, cape, as, a, place, to, supply, ships, travelling, between, the, netherlands, and, the, dutch, east, indies, there, was, a, close, association, between, the, cape, and, these, dutch, possessions, in, the, far, east, van, riebeeck, and, the, voc, began, to, import, large, numbers, of, slaves, primarily, from, madagascar, and, indonesia, these, slaves, often, married, dutch, settlers, and, their, descendants, became, known, as, the, cape, coloureds, and, the, cape, malays, during, the, 18th, century, the, dutch, settlement, in, the, area, of, the, cape, grew, and, prospered, by, the, late, 1700s, the, cape, colony, was, one, of, the, best, developed, european, settlements, outside, europe, or, the, americas, the, two, bases, of, the, cape, colony, s, economy, for, almost, the, entirety, of, its, history, were, shipping, and, agriculture, its, strategic, position, meant, that, almost, every, ship, sailing, between, europe, and, asia, stopped, off, at, the, colony, s, capital, cape, town, the, supplying, of, these, ships, with, fresh, provisions, fruit, and, wine, provided, a, very, large, market, for, the, surplus, produce, of, the, colony, some, free, burghers, continued, to, expand, into, the, rugged, hinterlands, of, the, north, and, east, many, began, to, take, up, a, semi, nomadic, pastoralist, lifestyle, in, some, ways, not, far, removed, from, that, of, the, khoikhoi, they, had, displaced, in, addition, to, its, herds, a, family, might, have, a, wagon, a, tent, a, bible, and, a, few, guns, as, they, became, more, settled, they, would, build, a, mud, walled, cottage, frequently, located, by, choice, days, of, travel, from, the, nearest, european, settlement, these, were, the, first, of, the, trekboers, wandering, farmers, later, shortened, to, boers, completely, independent, of, official, controls, extraordinarily, self, sufficient, and, isolated, from, the, government, and, the, main, settlement, in, cape, town, dutch, was, the, official, language, but, a, dialect, had, formed, that, was, quite, distinct, from, dutch, the, afrikaans, language, originated, mainly, from, 17th, century, dutch, dialects, this, dutch, dialect, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, kitchen, language, kombuistaal, would, eventually, in, the, late, 19th, century, be, recognised, as, a, distinct, language, called, afrikaans, and, replace, dutch, as, the, official, language, of, the, afrikaners, as, the, 18th, century, drew, to, a, close, dutch, mercantile, power, began, to, fade, and, the, british, moved, in, to, fill, the, vacuum, they, seized, the, cape, colony, in, 1795, to, prevent, it, from, falling, into, french, hands, then, briefly, relinquished, it, back, to, the, dutch, 1803, before, definitively, conquering, it, in, 1806, british, sovereignty, of, the, area, was, recognised, at, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, by, the, time, the, dutch, colony, was, seized, by, the, british, in, 1806, it, had, grown, into, an, established, settlement, with, 25, 000, slaves, 20, 000, white, colonists, 15, 000, khoisan, and, 1, 000, freed, black, slaves, outside, cape, town, and, the, immediate, hinterland, isolated, black, and, white, pastoralists, populated, the, country, dutch, interest, in, south, africa, was, based, chiefly, on, the, strategically, located, voc, port, yet, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, dutch, created, the, foundation, of, the, modern, state, of, south, africa, the, dutch, legacy, in, south, africa, is, evident, everywhere, but, particularly, in, the, afrikaner, people, and, the, afrikaans, language, the, united, provinces, of, the, netherlands, commonly, referred, to, in, historiography, as, the, dutch, republic, was, a, confederation, of, provinces, that, existed, from, 1579, until, the, batavian, revolution, in, 1795, it, was, the, first, independent, dutch, state, the, republic, was, established, after, seven, dutch, provinces, revolted, against, spanish, rule, declaring, their, independence, in, 1581, as, the, netherlands, was, a, republic, it, was, largely, governed, by, an, aristocracy, of, city, merchants, called, the, regents, rather, than, by, a, king, every, city, and, province, had, its, own, government, and, laws, and, a, large, degree, of, autonomy, after, attempts, to, find, a, competent, sovereign, proved, unsuccessful, it, was, decided, that, sovereignty, would, be, vested, in, the, various, provincial, estates, the, governing, bodies, of, the, provinces, the, estates, general, with, its, representatives, from, all, the, provinces, would, decide, on, matters, important, to, the, republic, as, a, whole, each, province, was, led, by, an, official, known, as, the, stadtholder, dutch, for, steward, this, office, was, nominally, open, to, anyone, but, most, provinces, appointed, a, member, of, the, house, of, orange, the, position, gradually, became, hereditary, with, the, prince, of, orange, simultaneously, holding, most, or, all, of, the, stadtholderships, making, him, effectively, the, head, of, state, this, created, tension, between, political, factions, the, orangists, favoured, a, powerful, stadtholder, while, the, republicans, favoured, a, strong, states, general, the, republicans, forced, two, stadtholderless, periods, 1650, 1672, and, 1702, 1747, with, the, latter, causing, national, instability, and, the, end, of, great, power, status, in, the, peace, of, westphalia, 1648, the, republic, gained, approximately, 20, more, territory, located, outside, the, member, provinces, which, was, ruled, directly, by, the, states, general, as, generality, lands, although, the, state, was, small, and, had, only, around, 1, 5, million, inhabitants, it, controlled, a, worldwide, network, of, seafaring, trade, routes, through, its, trading, companies, the,

commercialized, for, cash, crops, and, was, owned, by, urban, capitalists, not, nobles, there, were, few, links, between, holland, s, nobility, and, the, merchants, by, 1650, the, burgher, families, which, had, grown, wealthy, through, commerce, and, become, influential, in, government, controlled, the, province, of, holland, and, to, a, large, extent, shaped, national, policies, the, other, six, provinces, were, more, rural, and, traditional, in, life, style, had, an, active, nobility, and, played, a, small, role, in, commerce, and, national, politics, instead, they, concentrated, on, their, flood, protections, and, land, reclamation, projects, in, 1651, the, english, parliament, passed, the, first, of, the, navigation, acts, which, excluded, dutch, shipping, from, the, lucrative, trade, between, england, and, its, caribbean, colonies, and, led, directly, to, the, outbreak, of, hostilities, between, the, two, countries, the, following, year, the, first, of, three, anglo, dutch, wars, that, would, last, on, and, off, for, two, decades, and, slowly, erode, dutch, naval, power, to, england, s, benefit, the, anglo, dutch, wars, were, a, series, of, three, wars, which, took, place,

fleet, of, 140, ships, during, the, same, action, the, town, of, west, terschelling, was, burnt, down, which, caused, outrage, in, the, dutch, republic, economic, decline, led, to, a, period, of, political, instability, known, as, the, patriottentijd, 1780, 1787, this, unrest, was, temporarily, suppressed, by, a, prussian, invasion, in, support, of, the, stadtholder, the, french, revolution,

support, and, sent, soldiers, to, fight, in, the, french, armies, the, 1799, anglo, russian, invasion, of, holland, was, repulsed, by, batavian, french, forces, nevertheless, napoleon, replaced, it, because, the, regime, of, grand, pensionary, rutger, jan, schimmelpenninck, 1805, 1806, was, insufficiently, docile, the, confederal, structure, of, the, old, dutch, republic, was, permanently,

small, part, of, what, is, now, germany, into, the, kingdom, of, holland, putting, his, brother, louis, bonaparte, 1778, 1846, on, the, throne, the, new, king, was, unpopular, but, he, was, willing, to, cross, his, brother, for, the, benefit, of, his, new, kingdom, napoleon, forced, his, abdication, in, 1810, and, incorporated, the, netherlands, directly, into, the, french, empire, imposing, economic, controls, and, conscription, of, all, young, men, as, soldiers, when, the, french, retreated, from, the, northern, provinces, in, 1813, a, triumvirate, took, over, at, the, helm, of, a, provisional, government, although, most, members, of, the, provisional, government, had, been, among, the, men, who, had, driven, out, william, v, 18, years, earlier, the, leaders, of, the, provisional, government, knew, that, any, new, regime, would, have, to, be, headed, by, his, son, william, frederick, they, also, knew, that, it, would, be, better, in, the, long, term, if, the, dutch, people, themselves, installed, the, prince, rather, than, have, him, imposed, on, the, country, by, the, anti, french, alliance, accordingly, the, triumvirate, called, william, frederick, back, on, 30, november, and, offered, him, the, crown, he, refused, but, instead, proclaimed, himself, hereditary, sovereign, prince, on, 6, december, the, great, powers, had, secretly, agreed, to, merge, the, northern, netherlands, with, the, more, populated, austrian, netherlands, and, the, smaller, prince, bishopric, of, li, ge, into, a, single, constitutional, monarchy, having, a, stronger, country, on, france, s, northern, border, was, considered, especially, by, tsar, alexander, to, be, an, important, part, of, the, strategy, to, keep, france, s, power, in, check, in, 1814, william, frederick, gained, sovereignty, over, the, austrian, netherlands, and, li, ge, as, well, thus, william, frederick, had, fulfilled, his, family, s, three, century, quest, to, unite, the, low, countries, under, a, single, rule, on, 15, march, 1815, with, the, encouragement, of, the, powers, gathered, at, the, congress, of, vienna, william, frederick, raised, the, netherlands, to, the, status, of, a, kingdom, and, proclaimed, himself, king, william, i, this, was, made, official, later, in, 1815, when, the, low, countries, were, formally, recognized, as, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, the, crown, was, made, a, hereditary, office, of, the, house, of, orange, nassau, william, i, became, king, and, also, became, the, hereditary, grand, duke, of, luxembourg, that,

according, to, schama, about, 1800, the, local, school, teacher, was, the, humble, auxiliary, of, the, local, priest, despised, by, his, co, villagers, and, forced, to, subsist, on, the, gleanings, of, the, peasants, he, combined, drumming, the, catechism, into, the, heads, of, his, unruly, charges, with, the, duties, of, winding, the, town, clock, ringing, the, church, bells, or, digging, its, graves, his, principal, use, to, the, community, was, to, keep, its, boys, out, of, mischief, when, there, was, no, labour, for, them, in, the, fields, or, setting, the, destitute, orphans, of, the, town, to, the, useful, arts, of, picking, tow, or, spinning, crude, flax, as, one, would, expect, standards, in, such, an, occupation, were, dismal, but, in, 1806, the, dutch, led, by, adriaan, van, den, ende, energetically, set, out, to, modernise, education, focusing, on, a, new, system, for, advanced, training, of, teachers, with, an, elaborate, system, of, inspectors, training, courses, teacher, examinations, and, teaching, societies, by, 1826, although, much, smaller, than, france, the, dutch, national, government, was, spending, 12, times, more, than, paris, on, education, william, i, who, reigned, from, 1815, to, 1840, had, great, constitutional, power, an, enlightened, despot, he, accepted, the, modernizing, transformations, of, the, previous, 25, years, including, equality, of, all, before, the, law, however, he, resurrected, the, estates, as, a, political, class, and, elevated, a, large, number, of, people, to, the, nobility, voting, rights, were, still, limited, and, only, the, nobility, were, eligible, for, seats, in, the, upper, house, the, old, provinces, were, reestablished, in, name, only, the, government, was, now, fundamentally, unitary, and, all, authority, flowed, from, the, center, william, i, was, a, calvinist, and, unsympathetic, to, the, religious, culture, and, practices, of, the, catholic, majority, he, promulgated, the, fundamental, law, of, holland, with, some, modifications, this, entirely, overthrew, the, old, order, of, things, in, the, southern, netherlands, it, abolished, the, privileges, of, the, catholic, church, and, guaranteed, equal, protection, to, every, religious, creed, and, the, enjoyment, of, the, same, civil, and, political, rights, to, every, subject, of, the, king, it, reflected, the, spirit, of, the, french, revolution, and, in, so, doing, did, not, please, the, catholic, bishops, in, the, south, who, had, detested, the, revolution, william, i, actively, promoted, economic, modernization, the, first, 15, years, of, the, kingdom, showed, progress, and, prosperity, as, industrialization, proceeded, rapidly, in, the, south, where, the, industrial, revolution, allowed, entrepreneurs, and, labor, to, combine, in, a, new, textile, industry, powered, by, local, coal, mines, there, was, little, industry, in, the, northern, provinces, but, most, overseas, colonies, were, restored, and, highly, profitable, trade, resumed, after, a, 25, year, hiatus, economic, liberalism, combined, with, moderate, monarchical, authoritarianism, accelerated, the, adaptation, of, the, netherlands, to, the, new, conditions, of, the, 19th, century, the, country, prospered, until, a, crisis, arose, in, relations, with, the, southern, provinces, william, was, determined, to, create, a, united, people, even, though, the, north, and, south, had, drifted, far, apart, in, the, past, three, centuries, protestants, were, the, largest, denomination, in, the, north, population, 2, million, but, formed, a, quarter, of, the, population, in, the, overwhelmingly, catholic, south, population, 3, 5, million, nevertheless, protestants, dominated, william, s, government, and, army, the, catholics, did, not, consider, themselves, an, integral, part, of, the, united, netherlands, preferring, instead, to, identify, with, mediaeval, dutch, culture, other, factors, that, contributed, to, this, feeling, were, economic, the, south, was, industrialising, the, north, had, always, been, a, merchants, nation, and, linguistic, french, was, spoken, in, wallonia, and, a, large, part, of, the, bourgeoisie, in, flemish, cities, after, having, been, dominant, for, centuries, the, french, speaking, elite, in, the, southern, netherlands, now, felt, like, second, class, citizens, in, the, catholic, south, william, s, policies, were, unpopular, the, french, speaking, walloons, strenuously, rejected, his, attempt, to, make, dutch, the, universal, language, of, government, while, the, population, of, flanders, was, divided, flemings, in, the, south, spoke, a, dutch, dialect, flemish, and, welcomed, the, encouragement, of, dutch, with, a, revival, of, literature, and, popular, culture, other, flemings, notably, the, educated, bourgeoisie, preferred, to, speak, french, although, catholics, possessed, legal, equality, they, resented, their, subordination, to, a, government, that, was, fundamentally, protestant, in, spirit, and, membership, after, having, been, the, state, church, for, centuries, in, the, north, few, catholics, held, high, office, in, state, or, army, furthermore, political, liberals, in, the, south, complained, about, the, king, s, authoritarian, methods, all, southerners, complained, of, underrepresentation, in, the, national, legislature, although, the, south, was, industrializing, and, was, more, prosperous, than, the, north, the, accumulated, grievances, allowed, the, multiple, opposition, forces, to, coalesce, the, outbreak, of, revolution, in, france, in, 1830, was, a, signal, for, action, at, first, on, behalf, of, autonomy, for, belgium, as, the, southern, provinces, were, now, called, and, later, on, behalf, of, total, independence, william, dithered, and, his, half, hearted, efforts, to, reconquer, belgium, were, thwarted, both, by, the, efforts, of, the, belgians, themselves, and, by, the, diplomatic, opposition, of, the, great, powers, at, the, london, conference, of, 1830, the, chief, powers, of, europe, ordered, in, november, 1830, an, armistice, between, the, dutch, and, the, belgians, the, first, draft, for, a, treaty, of, separation, of, belgium, and, the, netherlands, was, rejected, by, the, belgians, a, second, draft, june, 1831, was, rejected, by, william, i, who, resumed, hostilities, franco, british, intervention, forced, william, to, withdraw, dutch, forces, from, belgium, late, in, 1831, and, in, 1833, an, armistice, of, indefinite, duration, was, concluded, belgium, was, effectively, independent, but, william, s, attempts, to, recover, luxembourg, and, limburg, led, to, renewed, tension, the, london, conference, of, 1838, 1839, prepared, the, final, dutch, belgian, separation, treaty, of, 1839, it, divided, luxembourg, and, limburg, between, the, dutch, and, belgian, crowns, the, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, thereafter, was, made, up, of, the, 11, northern, provinces, the, netherlands, did, not, industrialize, as, rapidly, as, belgium, after, 1830, but, it, was, prosperous, enough, griffiths, argues, that, certain, government, policies, facilitated, the, emergence, of, a, national, economy, in, the, 19th, century, however, compared, to, belgium, which, was, leading, in, industrialization, on, the, continent, the, netherlands, moved, slowly, possible, explanations, for, this, difference, are, the, higher, costs, due, to, geography, and, high, wages, and, the, emphasis, of, entrepreneurs, on, trade, rather, than, industry, for, example, in, the, dutch, coastal, provinces, agricultural, productivity, was, relatively, high, hence, industrial, growth, arrived, relatively, late, after, 1860, because, incentives, to, move, to, labour, intensive, industry, were, quite, weak, however, the, provinces, of, north, brabant, and, overijssel, did, industrialize, and, they, became, the, most, economically, advanced, areas, of, the, country, as, in, the, rest, of, europe, the, 19th, century, saw, the, gradual, transformation, of, the, netherlands, into, a, modern, middle, class, industrial, society, the, number, of, people, employed, in, agriculture, decreased, while, the, country, made, a, strong, effort, to, revive, its, stake, in, the, highly, competitive, shipping, and, trade, business, the, netherlands, lagged, behind, belgium, until, the, late, 19th, century, in, industrialization, and, caught, up, around, 1920, major, industries, included, textiles, and, later, the, great, philips, industrial, conglomerate, rotterdam, became, a, major, shipping, and, manufacturing, center, poverty, slowly, declined, as, begging, largely, disappeared, along, with, steadily, improving, working, conditions, for, the, population, in, 1840, william, i, abdicated, in, favor, of, his, son, william, ii, who, attempted, to, carry, on, the, policies, of, his, father, in, the, face, of, a, powerful, liberal, movement, in, 1848, unrest, broke, out, all, over, europe, although, there, were, no, major, events, in, the, netherlands, these, foreign, developments, persuaded, king, william, ii, to, agree, to, liberal, and, democratic, reform, that, same, year, johan, rudolf, thorbecke, a, prominent, liberal, was, asked, by, the, king, to, draft, a, constitution, that, would, turn, the, netherlands, into, a, constitutional, monarchy, the, new, constitution, was, proclaimed, on, 3, november, 1848, it, severely, limited, the, king, s, powers, making, the, government, accountable, only, to, an, elected, parliament, and, it, protected, civil, liberties, the, new, liberal, constitution, which, put, the, government, under, the, control, of, the, states, general, was, accepted, by, the, legislature, in, 1848, the, relationship, between, monarch, government, and, parliament, has, remained, essentially, unchanged, ever, since, in, fact, the, current, constitution, of, the, netherlands, is, the, 1848, constitution, albeit, with, amendments, william, ii, was, succeeded, by, william, iii, in, 1849, the, new, king, reluctantly, chose, thorbecke, to, head, the, new, government, which, introduced, several, liberal, measures, notably, the, extension, of, suffrage, however, thorbecke, s, government, soon, fell, when, protestants, rioted, against, the, vatican, s, reestablishment, of, the, catholic, episcopate, in, abeyance, since, the, 16th, century, a, conservative, government, was, formed, but, it, did, not, undo, the, liberal, measures, and, the, catholics, were, finally, given, equality, after, two, centuries, of, subordination, dutch, political, history, from, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, until, the, first, world, war, was, fundamentally, one, of, the, extension, of, liberal, reforms, in, government, the, reorganization, and, modernization, of, the, dutch, economy, and, the, rise, of, trade, unionism, and, socialism, as, working, class, movements, independent, of, traditional, liberalism, the, growth, in, prosperity, was, enormous, as, real, per, capita, gnp, soared, from, 106, guilders, in, 1804, to, 403, in, 1913, religion, was, a, contentious, issue, with, repeated, struggles, over, the, relations, of, church, and, state, in, the, field, of, education, in, 1816, the, government, took, full, control, of, the, dutch, reformed, church, nederlands, hervormde, kerk, in, 1857, all, religious, instruction, was, ended, in, public, schools, but, the, various, churches, set, up, their, own, schools, and, even, universities, dissident, members, broke, away, from, the, dutch, reformed, church, in, the, secession, of, 1834, they, were, harassed, by, the, government, under, an, onerous, napoleonic, law, prohibiting, gatherings, of, more, than, 20, members, without, a, permit, after, the, harassment, ended, in, the, 1850s, a, number, of, these, dissidents, eventually, created, the, christian, reformed, church, in, 1869, thousands, migrated, to, michigan, illinois, and, iowa, in, the, united, states, by, 1900, the, dissidents, represented, about, 10, of, the, population, compared, to, 45, of, the, population, who, were, in, the, dutch, reformed, church, which, continued, to, be, the, only, church, to, receive, state, money, at, mid, century, most, dutch, belonged, either, to, the, dutch, reformed, church, or, dissenter, groups, that, separated, from, it, around, 55, or, the, roman, catholic, church, 35, to, 40, together, with, smaller, protestant, for, example, lutheran, and, jewish, groups, a, large, and, powerful, sector, of, nominal, protestants, were, in, fact, secular, liberals, seeking, to, minimize, religious, influence, in, reaction, a, novel, alliance, developed, with, catholics, and, devout, calvinists, joining, against, secular, liberals, the, catholics, who, had, been, loosely, allied, with, the, liberals, in, earlier, decades, turned, against, them, on, the, issue, of, state, support, which, the, liberals, insisted, should, be, granted, only, to, public, schools, and, joined, with, protestant, political, parties, in, demanding, equal, state, support, to, schools, maintained, by, religious, groups, the, netherlands, remained, one, of, the, most, tolerant, countries, in, europe, towards, religious, belief, although, conservative, protestants, objected, to, the, liberalization, of, the, dutch, reformed, church, during, the, 19th, century, and, faced, opposition, from, the, government, when, they, tried, to, establish, separate, communities, catholics, and, other, non, protestants, were, left, unmolested, by, dutch, authorities, some, moved, to, the, united, states, as, a, consequence, but, as, the, century, drew, to, a, close, religious, persecution, had, totally, ceased, dutch, social, and, political, life, became, divided, by, fairly, clear, cut, internal, borders, that, were, emerging, as, the, society, pillarized, into, three, separate, parts, based, on, religion, the, economy, was, not, affected, one, of, the, people, most, responsible, for, designing, pillarization, was, abraham, kuyper, 1837, 1920, a, leading, politician, neo, calvinist, theologian, and, journalist, kuyper, established, orthodox, calvinist, organizations, and, also, provided, a, theoretical, framework, by, developing, such, concepts, as, sphere, sovereignty, that, celebrated, dutch, society, as, a, society, of, organized, minorities, verzuiling, pillarization, or, pluralism, after, 1850, became, the, solution, to, the, danger, of, internal, conflict, everyone, was, part, of, one, and, only, one, pillar, zuil, based, chiefly, on, religion, protestant, catholic, secular, the, secular, pillar, eventually, split, into, a, socialist, working, class, pillar, and, a, liberal, pro, business, secular, pillar, each, pillar, built, a, full, set, of, its, own, social, organizations, including, churches, for, the, religious, pillars, political, parties, schools, universities, labor, unions, sport, clubs, boy, scout, unions, and, other, youth, clubs, and, newspapers, the, members, of, different, zuilen, lived, in, close, proximity, in, cities, and, villages, spoke, the, same, language, and, did, business, with, one, another, but, seldom, interacted, informally, and, rarely, intermarried, in, politics, kuyper, formed, the, anti, revolutionary, party, arp, in, 1879, and, headed, it, until, 1905, pillarization, was, officially, recognized, in, the, pacification, of, 1917, whereby, socialists, and, liberals, achieved, their, goal, of, universal, male, suffrage, and, the, religious, parties, were, guaranteed, equal, funding, of, all, schools, in, 1930, radio, was, organized, so, that, each, pillar, had, full, control, of, its, own, network, when, television, began, in, the, late, 1940s, the, pillars, divided, up, time, equally, on, the, one, station, in, politics, and, civic, affairs, leaders, of, the, pillar, organizations, cooperated, and, they, acknowledged, the, right, of, the, other, pillars, so, public, life, generally, ran, smoothly, the, late, 19th, century, saw, a, cultural, revival, the, hague, school, brought, a, revival, of, realist, painting, 1860, 1890, the, world, famous, dutch, painter, was, vincent, van, gogh, but, he, spent, most, of, his, career, in, france, literature, music, architecture, and, science, also, flourished, a, representative, leader, of, science, was, johannes, diderik, van, der, waals, 1837, 1923, a, working, class, youth, who, taught, himself, physics, earned, a, phd, at, the, nation, s, leading, school, leiden, university, and, in, 1910, won, the, nobel, prize, for, his, discoveries, in, thermodynamics, hendrik, lorentz, 1853, 1928, and, his, student, pieter, zeeman, 1865, 1943, shared, the, 1902, nobel, prize, in, physics, other, notable, scientists, included, biologist, hugo, de, vries, 1848, 1935, who, rediscovered, mendelian, genetics, from, 1900, to, 1940, the, netherlands, experienced, significant, population, growth, this, era, included, significant, colonial, expansion, particularly, in, the, dutch, east, indies, coupled, with, the, challenges, posed, by, world, war, i, and, the, great, depression, although, the, netherlands, maintained, neutrality, during, world, war, i, its, strategic, geographic, location, and, colonial, resources, had, profound, implications, for, its, economic, and, political, stability, the, period, saw, the, rise, of, socialism, and, labor, unrest, which, were, partly, driven, by, industrialization, and, the, shifting, dynamics, of, dutch, society, world, war, ii, marked, a, devastating, period, for, the, netherlands, which, suffered, under, german, occupation, from, 1940, until, liberation, in, 1945, the, war, s, impact, was, severe, with, the, rotterdam, blitz, causing, extensive, destruction, and, loss, of, life, dutch, resistance, was, significant, though, the, nation, also, faced, collaboration, from, within, post, war, the, netherlands, underwent, a, painful, process, of, recovery, and, retribution, against, collaborators, the, immediate, post, war, years, were, focused, on, rebuilding, and, economic, stabilization, facilitated, by, u, s, aid, through, the, marshall, plan, which, helped, to, revive, the, dutch, economy, and, infrastructure, the, post, war, period, saw, significant, changes, in, the, dutch, empire, with, indonesia, proclaiming, independence, in, 1945, leading, to, a, violent, and, tumultuous, decolonization, process, completed, in, 1949, this, era, brought, about, substantial, social, change, within, the, netherlands, including, the, establishment, of, a, welfare, state, in, the, subsequent, decades, economic, prosperity, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, led, to, social, liberalization, culminating, in, progressive, policies, on, immigration, drugs, and, euthanasia, the, netherlands, also, became, a, founding, member, of, key, international, institutions, including, the, european, union, reflecting, its, deepening, commitment, to, international, cooperation, in, recent, decades, the, netherlands, has, continued, to, play, a, significant, role, in, global, affairs, maintaining, a, strong, economy, and, a, high, standard, of, living, challenges, such, as, immigration, and, integration, have, sparked, considerable, debate, particularly, in, the, context, of, rising, global, tensions, and, the, impact, of, globalization, dutch, society, today, remains, at, the, forefront, of, advocating, for, liberal, social, policies, environmental, sustainability, and, international, peace, upholding, its, long, tradition, of, political, and, social, innovation, the, american, john, lothrop, motley, was, the, first, foreign, historian, to, write, a, major, history, of, the, dutch, republic, in, 3500, pages, he, crafted, a, literary, masterpiece, that, was, translated, into, numerous, languages, his, dramatic, story, reached, a, wide, audience, in, the, 19th, century, motley, relied, heavily, on, dutch, scholarship, and, immersed, himself, in, the, sources, his, style, no, longer, attracts, readers, and, scholars, have, moved, away, from, his, simplistic, dichotomies, of, good, versus, evil, dutch, versus, spanish, catholic, versus, protestant, freedom, versus, authoritarianism, his, theory, of, causation, overemphasized, ethnicity, as, an, unchanging, characteristic, exaggerated, the, importance, of, william, of, orange, and, gave, undue, importance, to, the, issue, of, religious, tolerance, the, pioneering, dutch, cultural, historian, johan, huizinga, author, of, the, autumn, of, the, middle, ages, 1919, the, english, translation, was, called, the, waning, of, the, middle, ages, and, homo, ludens, a, study, of, the, play, element, in, culture, 1935, which, expanded, the, field, of, cultural, history, and, influenced, the, historical, anthropology, of, younger, historians, of, the, french, annales, school, he, was, influenced, by, art, history, and, advised, historians, to, trace, patterns, of, culture, by, studying, themes, figures, motifs, symbols, styles, and, sentiments, the, polder, model, continues, to, strongly, influence, historians, as, well, as, dutch, political, discussion, the, polder, model, stressed, the, need, for, finding, consensus, and, discouraged, furious, debate, and,

once, heralded, as, the, leading, event, of, modern, dutch, history, the, dutch, revolt, lasted, from, 1568, to, 1648, and, historians, have, worked, to, interpret, it, for, even, longer, in, 2007, laura, cruz, explained, the, major, debates, among, scholars, regarding, the, dutch, bid, for, independence, from, spanish, rule, while, agreeing, that, the, intellectual, milieus, of, late, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, affected, historians, interpretations, cruz, argued, that, writings, about, the, revolt, trace, changing, perceptions, of, the, role, played, by, small, countries, in, the, history, of, europe, in, recent, decades, grand, theory, has, fallen, out, of, favor, among, most, scholars, who, emphasize, the, particular, over, the, general, dutch, and, belgian, historiography, since, 1945, no, longer, says, the, revolt, was, the, culmination, of, an, inevitable, process, leading, to, independence, and, freedom, instead, scholars, have, put, the, political, and, economic, details, of, the, towns, and, provinces, under, the, microscope, while, agreeing, on, the, weaknesses, of, attempts, at, centralization, by, the, habsburg, rulers, the, most, influential, new, studies, have, been, rooted, in, demographic, and, economic, history, though, scholars, continue, to, debate, the, relationship, between, economics, and, politics, the, religious, dimension, has, been, viewed, in, terms, of, mentalities, exposing, the, minority, position, of, calvinism, while, the, international, aspects, have, been, studied, more, seriously, by, foreign, historians, than, by, the, dutch, themselves, pieter, geyl, was, the, leading, historian, of, the, dutch, revolt, and, an, influential, professor, at, the, university, of, london, 1919, 1935, and, at, the, state, university, of, utrecht, 1936, 1958, he, wrote, a, six, volume, history, of, the, dutch, speaking, peoples, the, nazis, imprisoned, him, in, world, war, ii, in, his, political, views, geyl, adopted, the, views, of, the, 17th, century, dutch, louvestein, faction, led, by, johan, van, oldenbarneveldt, and, johan, de, witt, it, stood, for, liberty, toleration, and, national, interests, in, contrast, to, the, orange, stadholders, who, sought, to, promote, their, own, self, interest, according, to, geyl, the, dutch, republic, reached, the, peak, of, its, powers, during, the, 17th, century, he, was, also, a, staunch, nationalist, and, suggested, that, flanders, could, split, off, from, belgium, and, join, the, netherlands, later, he, decried, what, he, called, radical, nationalism, and, stressed, more, the, vitality, of, western, civilization, geyl, was, highly, critical, of, the, world, history, approach, of, arnold, j, toynbee, jan, romein, created, a, theoretical, history, in, an, attempt, to, reestablish, the, relevance, of, history, to, public, life, in, the, 1930s, at, a, time, of, immense, political, uncertainty, and, cultural, crisis, when, romein, thought, that, history, had, become, too, inward, looking, and, isolated, from, other, disciplines, romein, a, marxist, wanted, history, to, contribute, to, social, improvement, at, the, same, time, influenced, by, the, successes, of, theoretical, physics, and, his, study, of, oswald, spengler, arnold, j, toynbee, frederick, john, teggart, and, others, he, spurred, on, the, development, of, theoretical, history, in, the, netherlands, to, the, point, where, it, became, a, subject, in, its, own, right, at, the, university, level, after, the, war, romein, used, the, term, integral, history, as, a, substitute, for, cultural, history, and, focused, his, attention, on, the, period, around, the, turn, of, the, century, he, concluded, that, a, serious, crisis, occurred, in, european, civilization, in, 1900, because, of, the, rise, of, anti, semitism, extreme, nationalism, discontent, with, the, parliamentary, system, depersonalization, of, the, state, and, the, rejection, of, positivism, european, civilization, waned, as, the, result, of, this, crisis, which, was, accompanied, by, the, rise, of, the, united, states, the, americanization, of, the, world, and, the, emergence, of, asia, his, interpretation, is, reminiscent, of, that, of, his, mentor, johan, huizinga, and, was, criticized, by, his, colleague, pieter, geyl
