art, of, central, asia, art, of, east, asia, art, of, south, asia, art, of, southeast, asia, art, of, europe, art, of, africa, art, of, the, americas, art, of, oceania, the, history, of, architecture, traces, the, changes, in, architecture, through, various, traditions, regions, overarching, stylistic, trends, and, dates, the, beginnings, of, all, these, traditions, is, thought, to, be, humans, satisfying, the, very, basic, need, of, shelter, and, protection, the, term, architecture, generally, refers, to, buildings, but, in, its, essence, is, much, broader, including, fields, we, now, consider, specialized, forms, of, practice, such, as, urbanism, civil, engineering, naval, military, and, landscape, architecture, trends, in, architecture, were, influenced, among, other, factors, by, technological, innovations, particularly, in, the, 19th, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, the, improvement, and, or, use, of, steel, cast, iron, tile, reinforced, concrete, and, glass, helped, for, example, art, nouveau, appear, and, made, beaux, arts, more, grandiose, humans, and, their, ancestors, have, been, creating, various, types, of, shelters, for, at, least, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, and, shelter, building, may, have, been, present, early, in, hominin, evolution, all, great, apes, will, construct, nests, for, sleeping, albeit, at, different, frequencies, and, degrees, of, complexity, chimpanzees, regularly, make, nests, out, of, bundles, of, branches, woven, together, these, vary, depending, on, the, weather, nests, have, thicker, bedding, when, cool, and, are, built, with, larger, stronger, supports, in, windy, or, wet, weather, orangutans, currently, make, the, most, complex, nests, out, of, all, non, human, great, apes, complete, with, roofs, blankets, pillows, and, bunks, it, has, been, argued, that, nest, building, practices, were, crucial, to, the, evolution, of, human, creativity, and, construction, skill, moreso, than, tool, use, as, hominins, became, required, to, build, nests, not, just, in, uniquely, adapted, circumstances, but, as, forms, of, signalling, retaining, arboreal, features, like, highly, prehensile, hands, for, the, expert, construction, of, nests, and, shelters, would, have, also, benefitted, early, hominins, in, unpredictable, environments, and, changing, climates, many, hominins, especially, the, earliest, ones, such, as, ardipithecus, and, australopithecus, retained, such, features, and, may, have, chosen, to, build, nests, in, trees, where, available, the, development, of, a, home, base, 2, million, years, ago, may, have, also, fostered, the, evolution, of, constructing, shelters, or, protected, caches, regardless, of, the, complexity, of, nest, building, early, hominins, may, still, have, still, slept, in, more, or, less, open, conditions, unless, the, opportunity, of, a, rock, shelter, was, afforded, these, rock, shelters, could, be, used, as, is, with, little, more, amendments, than, nests, and, hearths, or, in, the, case, of, established, bases, especially, among, later, hominins, they, could, be, personalized, with, rock, art, in, the, case, of, lascaux, or, other, types, of, aesthetic, structures, in, the, case, of, the, bruniquel, cave, among, the, neanderthals, in, cases, of, sleeping, in, open, ground, dutch, ethologist, adriaan, kortlandt, once, proposed, that, hominins, could, have, built, temporary, enclosures, of, thorny, bushes, to, deter, predators, which, he, supported, using, tests, that, showed, lions, becoming, averse, to, food, if, near, thorny, branches, in, 2000, archaeologists, at, the, meiji, university, in, tokyo, claimed, to, have, found, 2, pentagonal, alignments, of, post, holes, on, a, hillside, near, the, village, of, chichibu, interpreting, it, as, two, huts, dated, around, 500, 000, years, old, and, built, by, homo, erectus, currently, the, earliest, confirmed, purpose, built, structures, are, in, france, at, the, site, of, terra, amata, along, with, the, earliest, evidence, of, artificial, fire, c, 400, 000, years, ago, due, to, the, perishable, nature, of, shelters, of, this, time, it, is, difficult, to, find, evidence, for, dwellings, beyond, hearths, and, the, stones, that, may, make, up, a, dwelling, s, foundation, near, wadi, halfa, sudan, the, arkin, 8, site, contains, 100, 000, year, old, circles, of, sandstone, that, were, likely, the, anchor, stones, for, tents, in, eastern, jordan, post, hole, markings, in, the, soil, give, evidence, to, houses, made, of, poles, and, thatched, brush, around, 20, 000, years, ago, in, areas, where, bone, especially, mammoth, bone, is, a, viable, material, evidence, of, structures, preserve, much, more, easily, such, as, the, mammoth, bone, dwellings, among, the, mal, ta, buret, culture, 24, 15, 000, years, ago, and, at, mezhirich, 15, 000, years, ago, the, upper, paleolithic, in, general, is, characterized, by, the, expansion, and, cultural, growth, of, anatomically, modern, humans, as, well, as, the, cultural, growth, of, neanderthals, despite, their, steady, extinction, at, this, time, and, although, we, currently, lack, data, for, dwellings, built, before, this, time, the, dwellings, of, this, era, begin, to, more, commonly, show, signs, of, aesthetic, modification, such, as, at, mezhirich, where, engraved, mammoth, tusks, may, have, formed, the, facade, of, a, dwelling, architectural, advances, are, an, important, part, of, the, neolithic, period, 10, 000, 2000, bc, during, which, some, of, the, major, innovations, of, human, history, occurred, the, domestication, of, plants, and, animals, for, example, led, to, both, new, economics, and, a, new, relationship, between, people, and, the, world, an, increase, in, community, size, and, permanence, a, massive, development, of, material, culture, and, new, social, and, ritual, solutions, to, enable, people, to, live, together, in, these, communities, new, styles, of, individual, structures, and, their, combination, into, settlements, provided, the, buildings, required, for, the, new, lifestyle, and, economy, and, were, also, an, essential, element, of, change, although, many, dwellings, belonging, to, all, prehistoric, periods, and, also, some, clay, models, of, dwellings, have, been, uncovered, enabling, the, creation, of, faithful, reconstructions, they, seldom, included, elements, that, may, relate, them, to, art, some, exceptions, are, provided, by, wall, decorations, and, by, finds, that, equally, apply, to, neolithic, and, chalcolithic, rites, and, art, in, south, and, southwest, asia, neolithic, cultures, appear, soon, after, 10, 000, bc, initially, in, the, levant, pre, pottery, neolithic, a, and, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, and, from, there, spread, eastwards, and, westwards, there, are, early, neolithic, cultures, in, southeast, anatolia, syria, and, iraq, by, 8000, bc, and, food, producing, societies, first, appear, in, southeast, europe, by, 7000, bc, and, central, europe, by, c, 5500, bc, of, which, the, earliest, cultural, complexes, include, the, star, evo, koros, cris, linearbandkeramic, and, vin, a, neolithic, settlements, and, cities, include, mesopotamia, is, most, noted, for, its, construction, of, mud, brick, buildings, and, the, construction, of, ziggurats, occupying, a, prominent, place, in, each, city, and, consisting, of, an, artificial, mound, often, rising, in, huge, steps, surmounted, by, a, temple, the, mound, was, no, doubt, to, elevate, the, temple, to, a, commanding, position, in, what, was, otherwise, a, flat, river, valley, the, great, city, of, uruk, had, a, number, of, religious, precincts, containing, many, temples, larger, and, more, ambitious, than, any, buildings, previously, known, the, word, ziggurat, is, an, anglicized, form, of, the, akkadian, word, ziqqurratum, the, name, given, to, the, solid, stepped, towers, of, mud, brick, it, derives, from, the, verb, zaqaru, to, be, high, the, buildings, are, described, as, being, like, mountains, linking, earth, and, heaven, the, ziggurat, of, ur, excavated, by, leonard, woolley, is, 64, by, 46, meters, at, base, and, originally, some, 12, meters, in, height, with, three, stories, it, was, built, under, ur, nammu, circa, 2100, b, c, and, rebuilt, under, nabonidus, 555, 539, b, c, when, it, was, increased, in, height, to, probably, seven, stories, modern, imaginings, of, ancient, egypt, are, heavily, influenced, by, the, surviving, traces, of, monumental, architecture, many, formal, styles, and, motifs, were, established, at, the, dawn, of, the, pharaonic, state, around, 3100, bc, the, most, iconic, ancient, egyptian, buildings, are, the, pyramids, built, during, the, old, and, middle, kingdoms, c, 2600, 1800, bc, as, tombs, for, the, pharaoh, however, there, are, also, impressive, temples, like, the, karnak, temple, complex, the, ancient, egyptians, believed, in, the, afterlife, they, also, believed, that, in, order, for, their, soul, known, as, ka, to, live, eternally, in, their, afterlife, their, bodies, would, have, to, remain, intact, for, eternity, so, they, had, to, create, a, way, to, protect, the, deceased, from, damage, and, grave, robbers, this, way, the, mastaba, was, born, these, were, adobe, structures, with, flat, roofs, which, had, underground, rooms, for, the, coffin, about, 30, m, down, imhotep, an, ancient, egyptian, priest, and, architect, had, to, design, a, tomb, for, the, pharaoh, djoser, for, this, he, placed, five, mastabas, one, above, the, next, this, way, creating, the, first, egyptian, pyramid, the, pyramid, of, djoser, at, saqqara, c, 2667, 2648, bc, which, is, a, step, pyramid, the, first, smooth, sided, one, was, built, by, pharaoh, sneferu, who, ruled, between, c, 2613, and, 2589, bc, the, most, imposing, one, is, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, made, for, sneferu, s, son, khufu, c, 2589, 2566, bc, being, the, last, surviving, wonder, of, the, ancient, world, and, the, largest, pyramid, in, egypt, the, stone, blocks, used, for, pyramids, were, held, together, by, mortar, and, the, entire, structure, was, covered, with, highly, polished, white, limestone, with, their, tops, topped, in, gold, what, we, see, today, is, actually, the, core, structure, of, the, pyramid, inside, narrow, passages, led, to, the, royal, burial, chambers, despite, being, highly, associated, with, the, ancient, egypt, pyramids, have, been, built, by, other, civilisations, too, like, the, mayans, due, to, the, lack, of, resources, and, a, shift, in, power, towards, priesthood, ancient, egyptians, stepped, away, from, pyramids, and, temples, became, the, focal, point, of, cult, construction, just, like, the, pyramids, ancient, egyptian, temples, were, also, spectacular, and, monumental, they, evolved, from, small, shrines, made, of, perishable, materials, to, large, complexes, and, by, the, new, kingdom, circa, 1550, 1070, bc, they, have, become, massive, stone, structures, consisting, of, halls, and, courtyards, the, temple, represented, a, sort, of, cosmos, in, stone, a, copy, of, the, original, mound, of, creation, on, which, the, god, could, rejuvenate, himself, and, the, world, the, entrance, consisted, of, a, twin, gateway, pylon, symbolizing, the, hills, of, the, horizon, inside, there, were, columned, halls, symbolizing, a, primeval, papyrus, thicket, it, was, followed, by, a, series, of, hallways, of, decreasing, size, until, the, sanctuary, was, reached, where, a, god, s, cult, statue, was, placed, back, in, ancient, times, temples, were, painted, in, bright, colours, mainly, red, blue, yellow, green, orange, and, white, because, of, the, desert, climate, of, egypt, some, parts, of, these, painted, surfaces, were, preserved, well, especially, in, interiors, an, architectural, element, specific, to, ancient, egyptian, architecture, is, the, cavetto, cornice, a, concave, moulding, introduced, by, the, end, of, the, old, kingdom, it, was, widely, used, to, accentuate, the, top, of, almost, every, formal, pharaonic, building, because, of, how, often, it, was, used, it, will, later, decorate, many, egyptian, revival, buildings, and, objects, the, first, urban, civilization, in, the, indian, subcontinent, is, traceable, originally, to, the, indus, valley, civilisation, mainly, in, mohenjodaro, and, harappa, now, in, modern, day, pakistan, as, well, western, states, of, the, republic, of, india, the, earliest, settlements, are, seen, during, the, neolithic, period, in, merhgarh, balochistan, the, civilization, s, cities, were, noted, for, their, urban, planning, with, baked, brick, buildings, elaborate, drainage, and, water, systems, and, handicraft, carnelian, products, seal, carving, this, civilisation, transitioned, from, the, neolithic, period, into, the, chalcolithic, period, and, beyond, with, their, expertise, in, metallurgy, copper, bronze, lead, and, tin, their, urban, centres, possibly, grew, to, contain, between, 30, 000, and, 60, 000, individuals, and, the, civilisation, itself, may, have, contained, between, one, and, five, million, individuals, since, the, advent, of, the, classical, age, in, athens, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, classical, way, of, building, has, been, deeply, woven, into, western, understanding, of, architecture, and, indeed, of, civilization, itself, from, circa, 850, bc, to, circa, 300, ad, ancient, greek, culture, flourished, on, the, greek, mainland, on, the, peloponnese, and, on, the, aegean, islands, however, ancient, greek, architecture, is, best, known, for, its, temples, many, of, which, are, found, throughout, the, region, and, the, parthenon, is, a, prime, example, of, this, later, they, will, serve, as, inspiration, for, neoclassical, architects, during, the, late, 18th, and, the, 19th, century, the, most, well, known, temples, are, the, parthenon, and, the, erechtheion, both, on, the, acropolis, of, athens, another, type, of, important, ancient, greek, buildings, were, the, theatres, both, temples, and, theatres, used, a, complex, mix, of, optical, illusions, and, balanced, ratios, ancient, greek, temples, usually, consist, of, a, base, with, continuous, stairs, of, a, few, steps, at, each, edges, known, as, crepidoma, a, cella, or, naos, with, a, cult, statue, in, it, columns, an, entablature, and, two, pediments, one, on, the, front, side, and, another, in, the, back, by, the, 4th, century, bc, greek, architects, and, stonemasons, had, developed, a, system, of, rules, for, all, buildings, known, as, the, orders, the, doric, the, ionic, and, the, corinthian, they, are, most, easily, recognised, by, their, columns, especially, by, the, capitals, the, doric, column, is, stout, and, basic, the, ionic, one, is, slimmer, and, has, four, scrolls, called, volutes, at, the, corners, of, the, capital, and, the, corinthian, column, is, just, like, the, ionic, one, but, the, capital, is, completely, different, being, decorated, with, acanthus, leafs, and, four, scrolls, besides, columns, the, frieze, was, different, based, on, order, while, the, doric, one, has, metopes, and, triglyphs, with, guttae, ionic, and, corinthian, friezes, consist, of, one, big, continuous, band, with, reliefs, besides, the, columns, the, temples, were, highly, decorated, with, sculptures, in, the, pediments, on, the, friezes, metopes, and, triglyphs, ornaments, used, by, ancient, greek, architects, and, artists, include, palmettes, vegetal, or, wave, like, scrolls, lion, mascarons, mostly, on, lateral, cornices, dentils, acanthus, leafs, bucrania, festoons, egg, and, dart, rais, de, c, ur, beads, meanders, and, acroteria, at, the, corners, of, the, pediments, pretty, often, ancient, greek, ornaments, are, used, continuously, as, bands, they, will, later, be, used, in, etruscan, roman, and, in, the, post, medieval, styles, that, tried, to, revive, greco, roman, art, and, architecture, like, renaissance, baroque, neoclassical, etc, looking, at, the, archaeological, remains, of, ancient, and, medieval, buildings, it, is, easy, to, perceive, them, as, limestone, and, concrete, in, a, grey, taupe, tone, and, make, the, assumption, that, ancient, buildings, were, monochromatic, however, architecture, was, polychromed, in, much, of, the, ancient, and, medieval, world, one, of, the, most, iconic, ancient, buildings, the, parthenon, c, 447, 432, bc, in, athens, had, details, painted, with, vibrant, reds, blues, and, greens, besides, ancient, temples, medieval, cathedrals, were, never, completely, white, most, had, colored, highlights, on, capitals, and, columns, this, practice, of, coloring, buildings, and, artworks, was, abandoned, during, the, early, renaissance, this, is, because, leonardo, da, vinci, and, other, renaissance, artists, including, michelangelo, promoted, a, color, palette, inspired, by, the, ancient, greco, roman, ruins, which, because, of, neglect, and, constant, decay, during, the, middle, ages, became, white, despite, being, initially, colorful, the, pigments, used, in, the, ancient, world, were, delicate, and, especially, susceptible, to, weathering, without, necessary, care, the, colors, exposed, to, rain, snow, dirt, and, other, factors, vanished, over, time, and, this, way, ancient, buildings, and, artworks, became, white, like, they, are, today, and, were, during, the, renaissance, the, architecture, of, ancient, rome, has, been, one, of, the, most, influential, in, the, world, its, legacy, is, evident, throughout, the, medieval, and, early, modern, periods, and, roman, buildings, continue, to, be, reused, in, the, modern, era, in, both, new, classical, and, postmodern, architecture, it, was, particularly, influenced, by, greek, and, etruscan, styles, a, range, of, temple, types, was, developed, during, the, republican, years, 509, 27, bc, modified, from, greek, and, etruscan, prototypes, wherever, the, roman, army, conquered, they, established, towns, and, cities, spreading, their, empire, and, advancing, their, architectural, and, engineering, achievements, while, the, most, important, works, are, to, be, found, in, italy, roman, builders, also, found, creative, outlets, in, the, western, and, eastern, provinces, of, which, the, best, examples, preserved, are, in, modern, day, north, africa, turkey, syria, and, jordan, extravagant, projects, appeared, like, the, arch, of, septimius, severus, in, leptis, magna, present, day, libya, built, in, 216, ad, with, broken, pediments, on, all, sides, or, the, arch, of, caracalla, in, thebeste, present, day, algeria, built, in, c, 214, ad, with, paired, columns, on, all, sides, projecting, entablatures, and, medallions, with, divine, busts, due, to, the, fact, that, the, empire, was, formed, from, multiple, nations, and, cultures, some, buildings, were, the, product, of, combining, the, roman, style, with, the, local, tradition, an, example, is, the, palmyra, arch, present, day, syria, built, in, c, 212, 220, some, of, its, arches, being, embellished, with, a, repeated, band, design, consisting, of, four, ovals, within, a, circle, around, a, rosette, which, are, of, eastern, origin, among, the, many, roman, architectural, achievements, were, domes, which, were, created, for, temples, baths, villas, palaces, and, tombs, the, most, well, known, example, is, the, one, of, the, pantheon, in, rome, being, the, largest, surviving, roman, dome, and, having, a, large, oculus, at, its, centre, another, important, innovation, is, the, rounded, stone, arch, used, in, arcades, aqueducts, and, other, structures, besides, the, greek, orders, doric, ionic, and, corinthian, the, romans, invented, two, more, the, tuscan, order, was, influenced, by, the, doric, but, with, un, fluted, columns, and, a, simpler, entablature, with, no, triglyphs, or, guttae, while, the, composite, was, a, mixed, order, combining, the, volutes, of, the, ionic, order, capital, with, the, acanthus, leaves, of, the, corinthian, order, between, 30, and, 15, bc, the, architect, and, engineer, marcus, vitruvius, pollio, published, a, major, treatise, de, architectura, which, influenced, architects, around, the, world, for, centuries, as, the, only, treatise, on, architecture, to, survive, from, antiquity, it, has, been, regarded, since, the, renaissance, as, the, first, book, on, architectural, theory, as, well, as, a, major, source, on, the, canon, of, classical, architecture, just, like, the, greeks, the, romans, built, amphiteatres, too, the, largest, amphitheatre, ever, built, the, colosseum, in, rome, could, hold, around, 50, 000, spectators, another, iconic, roman, structure, that, demonstrates, their, precision, and, technological, advancement, is, the, pont, du, gard, in, southern, france, the, highest, surviving, roman, aqueduct, from, over, 3, 000, years, before, the, europeans, discovered, america, complex, societies, had, already, been, established, across, north, central, and, south, america, the, most, complex, ones, were, in, mesoamerica, notably, the, mayans, the, olmecs, and, the, aztecs, but, also, incas, in, south, america, structures, and, buildings, were, often, aligned, with, astronomical, features, or, with, the, cardinal, directions, much, of, the, mesoamerican, architecture, developed, through, cultural, exchange, for, example, the, aztecs, learnt, much, from, earlier, mayan, architecture, many, cultures, built, entire, cities, with, monolithic, temples, and, pyramids, decoratively, carved, with, animals, gods, and, kings, most, of, these, cities, had, a, central, plaza, with, governmental, buildings, and, temples, plus, public, ball, courts, or, tlachtli, on, raised, platforms, just, like, in, ancient, egypt, here, were, built, pyramids, too, being, generally, stepped, they, were, probably, not, used, as, burial, chambers, but, had, important, religious, sites, at, the, top, they, had, few, rooms, as, interiors, mattered, less, than, the, ritual, presence, of, these, imposing, structures, and, the, public, ceremonies, they, hosted, so, platforms, altars, processional, stairs, statuary, and, carving, were, all, important, inca, architecture, originated, from, the, tiwanaku, styles, founded, in, the, 2nd, century, b, c, e, the, incas, used, topography, and, land, materials, in, their, designs, with, the, capital, city, of, cuzco, still, containing, many, examples, the, famous, machu, picchu, royal, estate, is, a, surviving, example, along, with, sacsayhuam, n, and, ollantaytambo, the, incas, also, developed, a, road, system, along, the, western, continent, placing, their, distinctive, architecture, along, the, way, visually, asserting, their, imperial, rule, along, the, frontier, other, groups, such, as, the, muisca, did, not, construct, grand, architecture, of, stone, based, materials, but, rather, made, of, materials, like, wood, and, clay, after, the, fall, of, the, indus, valley, south, asian, architecture, entered, the, dharmic, period, which, saw, the, development, of, ancient, indian, architectural, styles, which, further, developed, into, various, unique, forms, in, the, middle, ages, along, with, the, combination, of, islamic, styles, and, later, other, global, traditions, buddhist, architecture, developed, in, the, indian, subcontinent, during, the, 4th, and, 2nd, century, bc, and, spread, first, to, china, and, then, further, across, asia, three, types, of, structures, are, associated, with, the, religious, architecture, of, early, buddhism, monasteries, viharas, places, to, venerate, relics, stupas, and, shrines, or, prayer, halls, chaityas, also, called, chaitya, grihas, which, later, came, to, be, called, temples, in, some, places, the, most, iconic, buddhist, type, of, building, is, the, stupa, which, consists, of, a, domed, structure, containing, relics, used, as, a, place, of, meditation, to, commemorate, buddha, the, dome, symbolised, the, infinite, space, of, the, sky, buddhism, had, a, significant, influence, on, sri, lankan, architecture, after, its, introduction, and, ancient, sri, lankan, architecture, was, mainly, religious, with, over, 25, styles, of, buddhist, monasteries, monasteries, were, designed, using, the, manjusri, vasthu, vidya, sastra, which, outlines, the, layout, of, the, structure, after, the, fall, of, the, gupta, empire, buddhism, mainly, survived, in, bengal, under, the, palas, and, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, pre, islamic, bengali, architecture, of, that, period, across, the, indian, subcontinent, hindu, architecture, evolved, from, simple, rock, cut, cave, shrines, to, monumental, temples, from, the, 4th, to, 5th, centuries, ad, hindu, temples, were, adapted, to, the, worship, of, different, deities, and, regional, beliefs, and, by, the, 6th, or, 7th, centuries, larger, examples, had, evolved, into, towering, brick, or, stone, built, structures, that, symbolise, the, sacred, five, peaked, mount, meru, influenced, by, early, buddhist, stupas, the, architecture, was, not, designed, for, collective, worship, but, had, areas, for, worshippers, to, leave, offerings, and, perform, rituals, many, indian, architectural, styles, for, structures, such, as, temples, statues, homes, markets, gardens, and, planning, are, as, described, in, hindu, texts, the, architectural, guidelines, survive, in, sanskrit, manuscripts, and, in, some, cases, also, in, other, regional, languages, these, include, the, vastu, shastras, shilpa, shastras, the, brihat, samhita, architectural, portions, of, the, puranas, and, the, agamas, and, regional, texts, such, as, the, manasara, among, others, since, this, architectural, style, emerged, in, the, classical, period, it, has, had, a, considerable, influence, on, various, medieval, architectural, styles, like,

had, roots, in, local, pre, islamic, building, styles, such, as, those, found, in, ancient, settlements, like, jenne, jeno, dia, mali, and, dhar, tichitt, some, of, which, employed, a, traditional,

of, the, ethiopian, state, styles, incorporated, more, wood, and, rounder, structures, in, domestic, architecture, in, the, center, of, the, country, and, the, south, and, these, stylistic, influences, were, manifested, in, the, construction, of, churches, and, monasteries, throughout, the, medieval, period, aksumite, architecture, and, influences, and, its, monolithic, tradition, persisted, with, its, influence, strongest, in, the, early, medieval, late, aksumite, and, zagwe, periods, when, the, rock, cut, monolithic, churches, of, lalibela, were, carved, throughout, the, medieval, period, and, especially, from, the, 10th, to, 12th, centuries, churches, were, hewn, out, of, rock, throughout, ethiopia, especially, during, the, northernmost, region, of, tigray, which, was, the, heart, of, the, aksumite, empire, the, most, famous, example, of, ethiopian, rock, hewn, architecture, are, the, eleven, monolithic, churches, of, lalibela, carved, out, of, the, red, volcanic, tuff, found, around, the, town, during, the, early, modern, period, in, ethiopia, the, absorption, of, new, diverse, influences, such, as, baroque, arab, turkish, and, gujarati, style,

8th, centuries, further, east, it, was, also, influenced, by, chinese, and, indian, architecture, as, islam, spread, to, southeast, asia, this, wide, and, long, history, has, given, rise, to, many, local, architectural, styles, including, but, not, limited, to, umayyad, abbasid, persian, moorish, fatimid, mamluk, ottoman, indo, islamic, particularly, mughal, sino, islamic, and, sahelian,

hypostyle, mosques, domed, mosques, and, mausoleums, structures, with, vaulted, iwans, and, madrasas, built, around, central, courtyards, in, secular, architecture, major, examples, of, preserved, historic, palaces, include, the, alhambra, and, the, topkapi, palace, islam, does, not, encourage, the, worship, of, idols, therefore, the, architecture, tends, to, be, decorated, with, arabic, calligraphy, including, qur, anic, verses, or, other, poetry, and, with, more, abstract, motifs, such, as, geometric, patterns, muqarnas, and, arabesques, as, opposed, to, illustrations, of, scenes, and, stories, surviving, examples, of, medieval, secular, architecture, mainly, served, for, defense, across, various, parts, of, europe, castles, and, fortified, walls, provide, the, most, notable, remaining, non, religious, examples, of, medieval, architecture, new, types, of, civic, military, as, well, as, religious, buildings, of, new, styles, begin, to, pop, up, in, this, region, during, this, period, byzantine, architects, built, city, walls, palaces, hippodromes, bridges, aqueducts, and, churches, they, built, many, types, of, churches, including, the, basilica, the, most, widespread, type, and, the, one, that, reached, the, greatest, development, after, the, early, period, the, most, common, layout, was, the, cross, in, square, with, five, domes, also, found, in, moscow, novgorod, or, kiev, as, well, as, in, romania, bulgaria, serbia, north, macedonia, and, albania, through, modifications, and, adaptations, of, local, inspiration, the, byzantine, style, will, be, used, as, the, main, source, of, inspiration, for, architectural, styles, in, all, eastern, orthodox, countries, for, example, in, romania, the, br, ncovenesc, style, is, highly, based, on, byzantine, architecture, but, also, has, individual, romanian, characteristics, just, as, the, parthenon, is, the, most, famous, building, of, ancient, greek, architecture, hagia, sophia, remains, the, iconic, church, of, orthodox, christianity, in, greek, and, roman, temples, the, exterior, was, the, most, important, part, of, the, temple, where, sacrifices, were, made, the, interior, where, the, cult, statue, of, the, deity, to, whom, the, temple, was, built, was, kept, often, had, limited, access, by, the, general, public, but, christian, liturgies, are, held, in, the, interior, of, the, churches, byzantine, exteriors, usually, have, little, if, any, ornamentation, byzantine, architecture, often, featured, marble, columns, coffered, ceilings, and, sumptuous, decoration, including, the, extensive, use, of, mosaics, with, golden, backgrounds, the, building, material, used, by, byzantine, architects, was, no, longer, marble, which, was, very, appreciated, by, the, ancient, greeks, they, used, mostly, stone, and, brick, and, also, thin, alabaster, sheets, for, windows, mosaics, were, used, to, cover, brick, walls, and, any, other, surface, where, fresco, would, not, resist, good, examples, of, mosaics, from, the, proto, byzantine, era, are, in, hagios, demetrios, in, thessaloniki, greece, the, basilica, of, sant, apollinare, nuovo, and, the, basilica, of, san, vitale, both, in, ravenna, italy, and, hagia, sophia, in, istanbul, from, the, very, beginning, of, the, formation, of, feudal, relations, the, architecture, and, urban, planning, of, armenia, entered, a, new, stage, the, ancient, armenian, cities, experienced, economic, decline, only, artashat, and, tigranakert, retained, their, importance, the, importance, of, the, cities, of, dvin, and, karin, erzurum, increased, the, construction, of, the, city, of, arshakavan, by, the, king, of, great, armenia, arshak, ii, was, not, completely, completed, christianity, brought, to, life, a, new, architecture, of, religious, buildings, which, was, initially, nourished, by, the, traditions, of, the, old, ancient, architecture, churches, of, the, 4th, 5th, centuries, are, mainly, basilicas, kasakh, 4th, 5th, centuries, ashtarak, 5th, century, akhts, 4th, century, yeghvard, 5th, century, some, basilicas, of, armenian, architecture, belong, to, the, so, called, western, type, of, basilica, churches, of, these, the, most, famous, are, the, churches, of, tekor, 5th, century, yererouk, iv, v, centuries, dvin, 470, tsitsernavank, iv, 5, centuries, the, three, nave, yereruyk, basilica, stands, on, a, 6, step, stylobate, presumably, built, on, the, site, of, an, earlier, pre, christian, temple, the, basilicas, of, karnut, 5th, century, yeghvard, 5th, century, garni, iv, century, zovuni, 5th, century, tsaghkavank, vi, century, dvina, 553, 557, tallinn, 5th, century, have, also, been, preserved, c, tanaat, 491, jarjaris, iv, v, centuries, lernakert, iv, v, centuries, etc, the, term, romanesque, is, rooted, in, the, 19th, century, when, it, was, coined, to, describe, medieval, churches, built, from, the, 10th, to, 12th, century, before, the, rise, of, steeply, pointed, arches, flying, buttresses, and, other, gothic, elements, this, style, of, architecture, emerged, nearly, simultaneously, in, multiple, countries, france, germany, italy, spain, for, 19th, century, critics, the, romanesque, reflected, the, architecture, of, stonemasons, who, evidently, admired, the, heavy, barrel, vaults, and, intricate, carved, capitals, of, the, ancient, romans, but, whose, own, architecture, was, considered, derivative, and, degenerate, lacking, the, sophistication, of, their, classical, models, scholars, in, the, 21st, century, are, less, inclined, to, understand, the, architecture, of, this, period, as, a, failure, to, reproduce, the, achievements, of, the, past, and, are, far, more, likely, to, recognise, its, profusion, of, experimental, forms, as, a, series, of, creative, new, inventions, at, the, time, however, research, has, questioned, the, value, of, romanesque, as, a, stylistic, term, on, the, surface, it, provides, a, convenient, designation, for, buildings, that, share, a, common, vocabulary, of, rounded, arches, and, thick, stone, masonry, and, appear, in, between, the, carolingian, revival, of, classical, antiquity, in, the, 9th, century, and, the, swift, evolution, of, gothic, architecture, after, the, second, half, of, the, 12th, century, one, problem, however, is, that, the, term, encompasses, a, broad, array, of, regional, variations, some, with, closer, links, to, rome, than, others, it, should, also, be, noted, that, the, distinction, between, romanesque, architecture, and, its, immediate, predecessors, and, followers, is, not, at, all, clear, there, is, little, evidence, that, medieval, viewers, were, concerned, with, the, stylistic, distinctions, that, we, observe, today, making, the, slow, evolution, of, medieval, architecture, difficult, to, separate, into, neat, chronological, categories, nevertheless, romanesque, remains, a, useful, word, despite, its, limitations, because, it, reflects, a, period, of, intensive, building, activity, that, maintained, some, continuity, with, the, classical, past, but, freely, reinterpreted, ancient, forms, in, a, new, distinctive, manner, romanesque, cathedrals, can, be, easily, differentiated, from, gothic, and, byzantine, ones, since, they, are, characterized, by, the, wide, use, of, thick, piers, and, columns, round, arches, and, severity, here, the, possibilities, of, the, round, arch, arcade, in, both, a, structural, and, a, spatial, sense, were, once, again, exploited, to, the, full, unlike, the, sharp, pointed, arch, of, the, later, gothic, the, romanesque, round, arch, required, the, support, of, massive, piers, and, columns, in, comparison, to, byzantine, churches, romanesque, ones, tend, to, lack, complex, ornamentation, both, on, the, exterior, and, interior, an, example, of, this, is, the, p, rigueux, cathedral, p, rigueux, france, built, in, the, early, 12th, century, and, designed, on, the, model, of, st, mark, s, basilica, in, venice, but, lacking, mosaics, leaving, its, interior, very, austere, and, minimalistic, gothic, architecture, began, with, a, series, of, experiments, which, were, conducted, to, fulfil, specific, requests, by, patrons, and, to, accommodate, the, ever, growing, number, of, pilgrims, visiting, sites, that, housed, precious, relics, pilgrims, in, the, high, middle, ages, circa, 1000, to, 1250, ad, increasingly, travelled, to, well, known, pilgrimage, sites, but, also, to, local, sites, where, local, and, national, saints, were, reputed, to, have, performed, miracles, the, churches, and, monasteries, housing, important, relics, therefore, wanted, to, heighten, the, popularity, of, their, respective, saints, and, build, appropriate, shrines, for, them, these, shrines, were, not, merely, gem, encrusted, reliquaries, but, more, importantly, took, the, form, of, powerful, architectural, settings, characterised, by, coloured, light, emitting, from, the, large, areas, of, stained, glass, the, use, of, stained, glass, however, is, not, the, only, defining, element, of, gothic, architecture, and, neither, are, the, pointed, arch, the, ribbed, vault, the, rose, window, or, the, flying, buttress, as, many, of, these, elements, were, used, in, one, way, or, another, in, preceding, architectural, traditions, it, was, rather, the, combination, and, constant, refinement, of, these, elements, along, with, the, quick, response, to, the, rapidly, changing, building, techniques, of, the, time, that, fuelled, the, gothic, movement, in, architecture, consequently, it, is, difficult, to, point, to, one, element, or, the, exact, place, where, gothic, first, emerged, however, it, is, traditional, to, initiate, a, discussion, of, gothic, architecture, with, the, basilica, of, st, denis, circa, 1135, 1344, and, its, patrons, abbot, suger, who, began, to, rebuild, the, west, front, and, the, choir, of, the, church, as, he, wrote, in, his, de, administratione, the, old, building, could, no, longer, accommodate, the, large, volumes, of, pilgrims, who, were, coming, to, venerate, the, relics, of, st, denis, and, the, solution, for, this, twofold, a, west, fa, ade, with, three, large, portals, and, the, innovative, new, choir, which, combined, an, ambulatory, with, radiating, chapels, that, were, unique, as, they, were, not, separated, by, walls, instead, a, row, of, slim, columns, was, inserted, between, the, chapels, and, the, choir, arcade, to, support, the, rib, vaults, the, result, enabled, visitors, to, circulate, around, the, altar, and, come, within, reach, of, the, relics, without, actually, disrupting, the, altar, space, while, also, experiencing, the, large, stained, glass, windows, within, the, chapels, as, confirmed, by, suger, the, desire, for, more, stained, glass, was, not, necessarily, to, bring, more, daylight, into, the, building, but, rather, to, fill, the, space, with, a, continuous, ray, of, colorful, light, rather, like, mosaics, or, precious, stones, which, would, make, the, wall, vanish, the, demand, for, ever, more, stained, glass, windows, and, the, search, for, techniques, that, would, support, them, are, constant, throughout, the, development, of, gothic, architecture, as, is, evident, in, the, writings, of, suger, who, was, fascinated, by, the, mystical, quality, of, such, lighting, brick, gothic, was, a, specific, style, of, gothic, architecture, common, in, northeast, and, central, europe, especially, in, the, regions, in, and, around, the, baltic, sea, which, do, not, have, resources, of, standing, rock, the, buildings, are, essentially, built, using, bricks, during, the, renaissance, italy, consisted, of, many, states, and, intense, rivalry, between, them, generated, an, increase, in, technical, and, artistic, developments, the, medici, family, an, italian, banking, family, and, political, dynasty, is, famous, for, its, financial, support, of, renaissance, art, and, architecture, the, period, began, in, around, 1452, when, the, architect, and, humanist, leon, battista, alberti, 1404, 1472, completed, his, treatise, de, re, aedificatoria, on, the, art, of, building, after, studying, the, ancient, ruins, of, rome, and, vitruvius, s, de, architectura, his, writings, covered, numerous, subjects, including, history, town, planning, engineering, sacred, geometry, humanism, and, philosophies, of, beauty, and, set, out, the, key, elements, of, architecture, and, its, ideal, proportions, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 15th, century, artists, and, architects, began, to, visit, rome, to, study, the, ruins, especially, the, colosseum, and, the, pantheon, they, left, behind, precious, records, of, their, studies, in, the, form, of, drawings, while, humanist, interest, in, rome, had, been, building, up, over, more, than, a, century, dating, back, at, least, to, petrarch, in, the, 14th, century, antiquarian, considerations, of, monuments, had, focused, on, literary, epigraphic, and, historical, information, rather, than, on, the, physical, remains, although, some, artists, and, architects, such, as, filippo, brunelleschi, 1377, 1446, donatello, circa, 1386, 1466, and, leon, battista, alberti, are, reported, to, have, made, studies, of, roman, sculpture, and, ruins, almost, no, direct, evidence, of, this, work, survives, by, the, 1480s, prominent, architects, such, as, francesco, di, giorgio, 1439, 1502, and, giuliano, da, sangallo, circa, 1445, 1516, were, making, numerous, studies, of, ancient, monuments, undertaken, in, ways, that, demonstrated, that, the, process, of, transforming, the, model, into, a, new, design, had, already, begun, in, many, cases, drawing, ruins, in, their, fragmentary, state, necessitated, a, leap, of, imagination, as, francesco, himself, readily, admitted, in, his, annotation, to, his, reconstruction, of, the, campidoglio, noting, largely, imagined, by, me, since, very, little, can, be, understood, from, the, ruins, soon, grand, buildings, were, constructed, in, florence, using, the, new, style, like, the, pazzi, chapel, 1441, 1478, or, the, palazzo, pitti, 1458, 1464, the, renaissance, begun, in, italy, but, slowly, spread, to, other, parts, of, europe, with, varying, interpretations, since, renaissance, art, is, an, attempt, of, reviving, ancient, rome, s, culture, it, uses, pretty, much, the, same, ornaments, as, the, ancient, greek, and, roman, however, because, most, if, not, all, resources, that, renaissance, artists, had, were, roman, renaissance, architecture, and, applied, arts, widely, use, certain, motifs, and, ornaments, that, are, specific, to, ancient, rome, the, most, iconic, one, is, the, margent, a, vertical, arrangement, of, flowers, leaves, or, hanging, vines, used, at, pilasters, another, ornament, associated, with, the, renaissance, is, the, round, medallion, containing, a, profile, of, a, person, similar, with, ancient, cameos, renaissance, baroque, rococo, and, other, post, medieval, styles, use, putti, chubby, baby, angels, much, more, often, compared, to, greco, roman, art, and, architecture, an, ornament, reintroduced, during, the, renaissance, that, was, of, ancient, roman, descent, that, will, also, be, used, in, later, styles, is, the, cartouche, an, oval, or, oblong, design, with, a, slightly, convex, surface, typically, edged, with, ornamental, scrollwork, the, baroque, emerged, from, the, counter, reformation, as, an, attempt, by, the, catholic, church, in, rome, to, convey, its, power, and, to, emphasize, the, magnificence, of, god, the, baroque, and, its, late, variant, the, rococo, were, the, first, truly, global, styles, in, the, arts, dominating, more, than, two, centuries, of, art, and, architecture, in, europe, latin, america, and, beyond, from, circa, 1580, to, circa, 1800, born, in, the, painting, studios, of, bologna, and, rome, in, the, 1580s, and, 1590s, and, in, roman, sculptural, and, architectural, ateliers, in, the, second, and, third, decades, of, the, 17th, century, the, baroque, spread, swiftly, throughout, italy, spain, and, portugal, flanders, france, the, netherlands, england, scandinavia, and, russia, as, well, as, to, central, and, eastern, european, centres, from, munich, germany, to, vilnius, lithuania, the, portuguese, spanish, and, french, empires, and, the, dutch, treading, network, had, a, leading, role, in, spreading, the, two, styles, into, the, americas, and, colonial, africa, and, asia, to, places, such, as, lima, mozambique, goa, and, the, philippines, due, to, its, spread, in, regions, with, different, architectural, traditions, multiple, kinds, of, baroque, appeared, based, on, location, different, in, some, aspects, but, similar, overall, for, example, french, baroque, appeared, severe, and, detached, by, comparison, preempting, neoclassicism, and, the, architecture, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, hybrid, native, american, european, baroque, architecture, first, appeared, in, south, america, as, opposed, to, mexico, in, the, late, 17th, century, after, the, indigenous, symbols, and, styles, that, characterize, this, unusual, variant, of, baroque, had, been, kept, alive, over, the, preceding, century, in, other, media, a, very, good, example, of, this, being, the, jesuit, church, in, arequipa, peru, the, first, baroque, buildings, were, cathedrals, churches, and, monasteries, soon, joined, by, civic, buildings, mansions, and, palaces, being, characterized, by, dynamism, for, the, first, time, walls, fa, ades, and, interiors, curved, a, good, example, being, san, carlo, alle, quattro, fontane, in, rome, baroque, architects, took, the, basic, elements, of, renaissance, architecture, including, domes, and, colonnades, and, made, them, higher, grander, more, decorated, and, more, dramatic, the, interior, effects, were, often, achieved, with, the, use, of, quadratura, or, trompe, l, il, painting, combined, with, sculpture, the, eye, is, drawn, upward, giving, the, illusion, that, one, is, looking, into, the, heavens, clusters, of, sculpted, angels, and, painted, figures, crowd, the, ceiling, light, was, also, used, for, dramatic, effect, it, streamed, down, from, cupolas, and, was, reflected, from, an, abundance, of, gilding, solomonic, columns, were, often, used, to, give, an, illusion, of, upwards, motion, and, other, decorative, elements, occupied, every, available, space, in, baroque, palaces, grand, stairways, became, a, central, element, besides, architecture, baroque, painting, and, sculpture, are, characterized, by, dynamism, too, this, is, in, contrast, with, how, static, and, peaceful, renaissance, art, is, besides, the, building, itself, the, space, where, it, was, placed, had, a, role, too, both, baroque, and, rococo, buildings, try, to, seize, viewers, attention, and, to, dominate, their, surroundings, whether, on, a, small, scale, such, as, the, san, carlo, alle, quattro, fontane, in, rome, or, on, a, massive, one, like, the, new, facade, of, the, santiago, de, compostela, cathedral, designed, to, tower, over, the, city, a, manifestation, of, power, and, authority, on, the, grandest, scale, baroque, urban, planning, and, renewal, was, promoted, by, the, church, and, the, state, alike, it, was, the, first, era, since, antiquity, to, experience, mass, migration, into, cities, and, urban, planners, took, idealistic, measures, to, regulate, them, the, most, notable, early, example, was, domenico, fontana, s, restructuring, of, rome, s, street, plan, of, pope, sixtus, v, architects, had, experimented, with, idealized, city, schemes, since, the, early, renaissance, examples, being, leon, battista, alberti, 1404, 1472, planning, a, centralized, model, city, with, streets, leading, to, a, central, piazza, or, filarete, antonio, di, pietro, aver, u, lino, c, 1400, c, 1469, designing, a, round, city, named, sforzinda, 1451, 1456, that, he, based, on, parts, of, the, human, body, in, the, idea, that, a, healthy, city, should, reflect, the, physiognomy, of, its, inhabitants, however, none, of, these, idealistic, cities, has, ever, been, built, in, fact, few, such, projects, were, put, into, practice, in, europe, as, new, cities, were, prohibitively, costly, and, existing, urban, areas, with, existing, churches, and, palaces, could, not, be, demolished, only, in, the, americas, where, architects, often, had, a, clean, space, to, work, with, were, such, cities, possible, as, in, lima, peru, or, buenos, aires, argentina, the, earliest, baroque, ideal, city, is, zamo, built, north, east, of, krak, w, poland, by, the, italian, architect, bernardo, morando, c, 1540, 1600, being, a, centralized, town, focusing, on, a, square, with, radiating, streets, where, entire, cities, could, not, be, rebuilt, patrons, and, architects, compensated, by, creating, spacious, and, symmetrical, squares, often, with, avenues, and, radiating, out, at, perpendicular, angles, and, focusing, on, a, fountain, statue, or, obelisk, a, good, example, of, this, is, the, place, des, vosges, formerly, place, royale, commissioned, by, henry, iv, probably, after, plans, by, baptiste, du, cerceau, 1545, 1590, the, most, famous, baroque, space, in, the, world, is, gianlorenzo, bernini, s, st, peter, s, square, in, rome, similar, with, ideal, urban, planning, baroque, gardens, are, characterized, by, straight, and, readapting, avenues, with, geometric, spaces, the, name, rococo, derives, from, the, french, word, rocaille, which, describes, shell, covered, rock, work, and, coquille, meaning, seashell, rococo, architecture, is, fancy, and, fluid, accentuating, asymmetry, with, an, abundant, use, of, curves, scrolls, gilding, and, ornaments, the, style, enjoyed, great, popularity, with, the, ruling, elite, of, europe, during, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, it, developed, in, france, out, of, a, new, fashion, in, interior, decoration, and, spread, across, europe, domestic, rococo, abandoned, baroque, s, high, moral, tone, its, weighty, allegories, and, its, obsession, with, legitimacy, in, fact, its, abstract, forms, and, carefree, pastoral, subjects, related, more, to, notions, of, refuge, and, joy, that, created, a, more, forgiving, atmosphere, for, polite, conversations, rococo, rooms, are, typically, smaller, than, their, baroque, counterparts, reflecting, a, movement, towards, domestic, intimacy, even, the, grander, salons, used, for, entertaining, were, more, modest, in, scale, as, social, events, involved, smaller, numbers, of, guests, characteristic, of, the, style, were, rocaille, motifs, derived, from, the, shells, icicles, and, rock, work, or, grotto, decoration, rocaille, arabesques, were, mostly, abstract, forms, laid, out, symmetrically, over, and, around, architectural, frames, a, favourite, motif, was, the, scallop, shell, whose, top, scrolls, echoed, the, basic, s, and, c, framework, scrolls, of, the, arabesques, and, whose, sinuous, ridges, echoed, the, general, curvilinearity, of, the, room, decoration, while, few, rococo, exteriors, were, built, in, france, a, number, of, rococo, churches, are, found, in, southern, germany, other, widely, user, motifs, in, decorative, arts, and, interior, architecture, include, acanthus, and, other, leaves, birds, bouquets, of, flowers, fruits, elements, associated, with, love, putti, quivers, with, arrows, ans, arrowed, hearts, trophies, of, arms, putti, medallions, with, faces, many, many, flowers, and, far, eastern, elements, pagodes, dragons, monkeys, bizarre, flowers, bamboo, and, chinese, people, pastel, colours, were, widely, used, like, light, blue, mint, green, or, pink, rococo, designers, also, loved, mirrors, the, more, the, better, an, example, being, the, hall, of, mirrors, of, the, amalienburg, munich, germany, by, johann, baptist, zimmermann, generally, mirrors, are, also, featured, above, fireplaces, the, interactions, between, east, and, west, brought, on, by, colonialist, exploration, have, had, an, impact, on, aesthetics, because, of, being, something, rare, and, new, to, westerners, some, non, european, styles, were, really, appreciated, during, the, 17th, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, some, nobles, and, kings, built, little, structures, inspired, by, these, styles, in, the, gardens, of, their, palaces, or, fully, decorated, a, handful, of, rooms, of, palaces, like, this, because, of, not, fully, understanding, the, origins, and, principles, that, govern, these, exotic, aesthetics, europeans, sometimes, created, hybrids, of, the, style, which, they, tried, to, replicate, and, which, were, the, trends, at, that, time, a, good, example, of, this, is, chinoiserie, a, western, decorative, style, popular, during, the, 18th, century, that, was, heavily, inspired, by, chinese, arts, but, also, by, rococo, at, the, same, time, because, traveling, to, china, or, other, far, eastern, countries, was, something, hard, at, that, time, and, so, remained, mysterious, to, most, westerners, european, imagination, were, fuelled, by, perceptions, of, asia, as, a, place, of, wealth, and, luxury, and, consequently, patrons, from, emperors, to, merchants, vied, with, each, other, in, adorning, their, living, quarters, with, asian, goods, and, decorating, them, in, asian, styles, where, asian, objects, were, hard, to, obtain, european, craftsmen, and, painters, stepped, up, to, fill, the, demand, creating, a, blend, of, rococo, forms, and, asian, figures, motifs, and, techniques, chinese, art, was, not, the, only, foreign, style, with, which, europeans, experimented, another, was, the, islamic, one, examples, of, this, include, the, garden, mosque, of, the, schwetzingen, palace, in, germany, the, only, surviving, example, of, an, 18th, century, european, garden, mosque, the, royal, pavilion, in, brighton, or, the, moorish, revival, buildings, from, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, with, horseshoe, arches, and, brick, patterns, when, it, come, to, the, orient, europeans, also, had, an, interest, for, the, culture, of, ancient, egypt, compared, to, other, cases, of, exoticism, the, one, with, the, land, of, pharaohs, is, the, oldest, one, since, ancient, greeks, and, romans, had, this, interest, during, antiquity, the, main, periods, when, egyptian, revival, monuments, were, erected, were, the, early, 19th, century, with, napoleon, s, military, campaigns, in, egypt, and, the, 1920s, when, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, was, discovered, in, 1922, which, caused, an, egyptomania, that, lead, to, art, deco, sometimes, using, motifs, inspired, by, ancient, egypt, during, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, century, neoclassicism, sometimes, mixed, greco, roman, elements, with, egyptian, ones, because, of, its, association, with, pharaohs, death, and, eternity, multiple, egyptian, revival, tombs, or, cemetery, entry, gates, were, built, in, this, style, besides, mortuary, structures, other, buildings, in, this, style, include, certain, synagogues, like, the, karlsruhe, synagogue, or, some, empire, monuments, built, during, the, reign, of, nepoleon, such, as, the, egyptian, portico, of, the, h, tel, beauharnais, or, the, fontaine, du, fellah, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, pre, columbian, mesoamerican, architecture, was, of, great, interest, for, some, american, architects, particularly, what, the, mayans, built, several, of, frank, lloyd, wright, s, california, houses, were, erected, in, a, mayan, revival, style, while, other, architects, combined, mayan, motifs, with, art, deco, ones, neoclassical, architecture, focused, on, ancient, greek, and, roman, details, plain, white, walls, and, grandeur, of, scale, compared, to, the, previous, styles, baroque, and, rococo, neoclassical, exteriors, tended, to, be, more, minimalist, featuring, straight, and, angular, lines, but, being, still, ornamented, the, style, s, clean, lines, and, sense, of, balance, and, proportion, worked, well, for, grand, buildings, such, as, the, panth, on, in, paris, and, for, smaller, structures, alike, such, as, the, petit, trianon, excavations, during, the, 18th, century, at, pompeii, and, herculaneum, which, had, both, been, buried, under, volcanic, ash, during, the, 79, ad, eruption, of, mount, vesuvius, inspired, a, return, to, order, and, rationality, largely, thanks, to, the, writings, of, johann, joachim, winckelmann, in, the, mid, 18th, century, antiquity, was, upheld, as, a, standard, for, architecture, as, never, before, neoclassicism, was, a, fundamental, investigation, of, the, very, bases, of, architectural, form, and, meaning, in, the, 1750s, an, alliance, between, archaeological, exploration, and, architectural, theory, started, which, will, continue, in, the, 19th, century, marc, antoine, laugier, wrote, in, 1753, that, architecture, owes, all, that, is, perfect, to, the, greeks, the, style, was, adopted, by, progressive, circles, in, other, countries, such, as, sweden, and, russia, federal, style, architecture, is, the, name, for, the, classicizing, architecture, built, in, north, america, between, c, 1780, and, 1830, and, particularly, from, 1785, to, 1815, this, style, shares, its, name, with, its, era, the, federal, period, the, term, is, also, used, in, association, with, furniture, design, in, the, united, states, of, the, same, time, period, the, style, broadly, corresponds, to, the, middle, class, classicism, of, biedermeier, style, in, the, german, speaking, lands, regency, style, in, britain, and, to, the, french, empire, style, in, central, and, eastern, europe, the, style, is, usually, referred, to, as, classicism, german, klassizismus, russian, while, the, newer, revival, styles, of, the, 19th, century, until, today, are, called, neoclassical, tienne, louis, boull, e, 1728, 1799, was, a, visionary, architect, of, the, period, his, utopian, projects, never, built, included, a, monument, to, isaac, newton, 1784, in, the, form, of, an, immense, dome, with, an, oculus, allowing, the, light, to, enter, giving, the, impression, of, a, sky, full, of, stars, his, project, for, an, enlargement, of, the, royal, library, 1785, was, even, more, dramatic, with, a, gigantic, arch, sheltering, the, collection, of, books, while, none, of, his, projects, were, ever, built, the, images, were, widely, published, and, inspired, architects, of, the, period, to, look, outside, the, traditional, forms, similarly, with, the, renaissance, and, baroque, periods, during, the, neoclassical, one, urban, theories, of, how, a, good, city, should, be, appeared, too, enlightenment, writers, of, the, 18th, century, decried, the, problems, of, paris, at, that, time, the, biggest, one, being, the, big, number, of, narrow, medieval, streets, crowded, with, modest, houses, voltaire, openly, criticized, the, failure, of, the, french, royal, administration, to, initiate, public, works, improve, the, quality, of, life, in, towns, and, stimulate, the, economy, it, is, time, for, those, who, rule, the, most, opulent, capital, in, europe, to, make, it, the, most, comfortable, and, the, most, magnificent, of, cities, there, must, be, public, markets, fountains, which, actually, provide, water, and, regular, pavements, the, narrow, and, infected, streets, must, be, widened, monuments, that, cannot, be, seen, must, be, revealed, and, new, ones, built, for, all, to, see, voltaire, insisted, in, a, polemical, essay, on, the, embellishments, of, paris, in, 1749, in, the, same, year, tienne, la, font, de, saint, yenne, criticized, how, louis, xiv, s, great, east, fa, ade, of, the, louvre, was, all, but, hidden, from, views, by, a, dense, quarter, of, modest, houses, voltaire, also, said, that, in, order, to, transform, paris, into, a, city, that, could, rival, ancient, rome, it, was, necessary, to, demolish, more, than, it, was, to, built, our, towns, are, still, what, they, were, a, mass, of, houses, crowded, together, haphazardly, without, system, planning, or, design, marc, antoine, laugier, complained, in, 1753, writing, a, decade, later, pierre, patte, promoted, an, urban, reform, in, quest, of, health, social, order, and, security, launching, at, the, same, time, a, medical, and, organic, metaphor, which, compared, the, operations, of, urban, design, to, those, of, the, surgeons, with, bad, air, and, lack, of, fresh, water, its, current, state, was, pathological, patte, asserted, calling, for, fountains, to, be, placed, at, principal, intersections, and, markets, squares, are, recommended, promote, the, circulation, of, air, and, for, the, same, reason, houses, on, the, city, s, bridges, should, be, demolished, he, also, criticized, the, location, of, hospitals, next, to, markets, and, protested, continued, burials, in, overcrowded, city, churchyards, besides, cities, new, ideas, of, how, a, garden, should, be, appeared, in, 18th, century, england, making, place, for, the, english, landscape, garden, aka, jardin, l, anglaise, characterized, by, an, idealized, view, of, nature, and, the, use, of, greco, roman, or, gothic, ruins, bridges, and, other, picturesque, architecture, designed, to, recreate, an, idyllic, pastoral, landscape, it, was, the, opposite, of, the, symmetrical, and, geometrically, planned, baroque, garden, aka, jardin, la, fran, aise, the, 19th, century, was, dominated, by, a, wide, variety, of, stylistic, revivals, variations, and, interpretations, revivalism, in, architecture, is, the, use, of, visual, styles, that, consciously, echo, the, style, of, a, previous, architectural, era, modern, day, revival, styles, can, be, summarized, within, new, classical, architecture, and, sometimes, under, the, umbrella, term, traditional, architecture, the, idea, that, architecture, might, represent, the, glory, of, kingdoms, can, be, traced, to, the, dawn, of, civilisation, but, the, notion, that, architecture, can, bear, the, stamp, of, national, character, is, a, modern, idea, that, appeared, in, the, 18th, century, historical, thinking, and, given, political, currency, in, the, wake, of, the, french, revolution, as, the, map, of, europe, was, repeatedly, changing, architecture, was, used, to, grant, the, aura, of, a, glorious, past, to, even, the, most, recent, nations, in, addition, to, the, credo, of, universal, classicism, two, new, and, often, contradictory, attitudes, on, historical, styles, existed, in, the, early, 19th, century, pluralism, promoted, the, simultaneous, use, of, the, expanded, range, of, style, while, revivalism, held, that, a, single, historical, model, was, appropriate, for, modern, architecture, associations, between, styles, and, building, types, appeared, for, example, egyptian, for, prisons, gothic, for, churches, or, renaissance, revival, for, banks, and, exchanges, these, choices, were, the, result, of, other, associations, the, pharaohs, with, death, and, eternity, the, middle, ages, with, christianity, or, the, medici, family, with, the, rise, of, banking, and, modern, commerce, whether, their, choice, was, classical, medieval, or, renaissance, all, revivalists, shared, the, strategy, of, advocating, a, particular, style, based, on, national, history, one, of, the, great, enterprises, of, historians, in, the, early, 19th, century, only, one, historic, period, was, claimed, to, be, the, only, one, capable, of, providing, models, grounded, in, national, traditions, institutions, or, values, issues, of, style, became, matters, of, state, the, most, well, known, revivalist, style, is, the, gothic, revival, one, that, appeared, in, the, mid, 18th, century, in, the, houses, of, a, number, of, wealthy, antiquarians, in, england, a, notable, example, being, the, strawberry, hill, house, german, romantic, writers, and, architects, were, the, first, to, promote, gothic, as, a, powerful, expression, of, national, character, and, in, turn, use, it, as, a, symbol, of, national, identity, in, territories, still, divided, johann, gottfried, herder, posed, the, question, why, should, we, always, imitate, foreigners, as, if, we, were, greeks, or, romans, in, art, and, architecture, history, the, term, orientalism, refers, to, the, works, of, the, western, artists, who, specialized, in, oriental, subjects, produced, from, their, travels, in, western, asia, during, the, 19th, century, in, that, time, artists, and, scholars, were, described, as, orientalists, especially, in, france, in, india, during, the, british, raj, a, new, style, indo, saracenic, also, known, as, indo, gothic, mughal, gothic, neo, mughal, or, hindoo, style, was, getting, developed, which, incorporated, varying, degrees, of, indian, elements, into, the, western, european, style, the, churches, and, convents, of, goa, are, another, example, of, the, blending, of, traditional, indian, styles, with, western, european, architectural, styles, most, indo, saracenic, public, buildings, were, constructed, between, 1858, and, 1947, with, the, peaking, at, 1880, the, style, has, been, described, as, part, of, a, 19th, century, movement, to, project, themselves, as, the, natural, successors, of, the, mughals, they, were, often, built, for, modern, functions, such, as, transport, stations, government, offices, and, law, courts, it, is, much, more, evident, in, british, power, centres, in, the, subcontinent, like, mumbai, chennai, and, kolkata, the, beaux, arts, style, takes, its, name, from, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, in, paris, where, it, developed, and, where, many, of, the, main, exponents, of, the, style, studied, due, to, the, fact, that, international, students, studied, here, there, are, buildings, from, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, early, 20th, century, of, this, type, all, over, the, world, designed, by, architects, like, charles, girault, thomas, hastings, ion, d, berindey, or, petre, antonescu, today, from, bucharest, to, buenos, aires, and, from, san, francisco, to, brussels, the, beaux, arts, style, survives, in, opera, houses, civic, structures, university, campuses, commemorative, monuments, luxury, hotels, and, townhouses, the, style, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, paris, op, ra, house, 1860, 1875, designed, by, charles, garnier, the, masterpiece, of, the, 19th, century, renovation, of, paris, dominating, its, entire, neighbourhood, and, continuing, to, astonish, visitors, with, its, majestic, staircase, and, reception, halls, the, op, ra, was, an, aesthetic, and, societal, turning, point, in, french, architecture, here, garnier, showed, what, he, called, a, style, actuel, which, was, influenced, by, the, spirit, of, the, time, aka, zeitgeist, and, reflected, the, designer, s, personal, taste, beaux, arts, fa, ades, were, usually, imbricated, or, layered, with, overlapping, classical, elements, or, sculpture, often, fa, ades, consisted, of, a, high, rusticated, basement, level, after, it, a, few, floors, high, level, usually, decorated, with, pilasters, or, columns, and, at, the, top, an, attic, level, and, or, the, roof, beaux, arts, architects, were, often, commissioned, to, design, monumental, civic, buildings, symbolic, of, the, self, confidence, of, the, town, or, city, the, style, aimed, for, a, baroque, opulence, through, lavishly, decorated, monumental, structures, that, evoked, louis, xiv, s, versailles, however, it, was, not, just, a, revival, of, the, baroque, being, more, of, a, synthesis, of, classicist, styles, like, renaissance, baroque, rococo, neoclassicism, etc, because, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, new, technologies, it, brought, new, types, of, buildings, have, appeared, by, 1850, iron, was, quite, present, in, dailylife, at, every, scale, from, mass, produced, decorative, architectural, details, and, objects, of, apartment, buildings, and, commercial, buildings, to, train, sheds, a, well, known, 19th, century, glass, and, iron, building, is, the, crystal, palace, from, hyde, park, london, built, in, 1851, to, house, the, great, exhibition, having, an, appearance, similar, with, a, greenhouse, its, scale, was, daunting, the, marketplace, pioneered, novel, uses, of, iron, and, glass, to, create, an, architecture, of, display, and, consumption, that, made, the, temporary, display, of, the, world, fairs, a, permanent, feature, of, modern, urban, life, just, after, a, year, after, the, crystal, palace, was, dismantaled, aristide, boucicaut, opened, what, historians, of, mass, consumption, have, labelled, the, first, department, store, le, bon, march, in, paris, as, the, store, expanded, its, exterior, took, on, the, form, of, a, public, monument, being, highly, decorated, with, french, renaissance, revival, motifs, the, entrances, advanced, subtly, onto, the, pavemenet, hoping, to, captivate, the, attention, of, potential, customers, between, 1872, and, 1874, the, interior, was, remodelled, by, louis, charles, boileau, in, collaboration, with, the, young, engineering, firm, of, gustave, eiffel, in, place, of, the, open, courtyard, required, to, permit, more, daylight, into, the, interior, the, new, building, focused, around, three, skylight, atria, popular, in, many, countries, from, the, early, 1890s, until, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, art, nouveau, was, an, influential, although, relatively, brief, art, and, design, movement, and, philosophy, despite, being, a, short, lived, fashion, it, paved, the, way, for, the, modern, architecture, of, the, 20th, century, between, c, 1870, and, 1900, a, crisis, of, historicism, occurred, during, which, the, historicist, culture, was, critiqued, one, of, the, voices, being, friedrich, nietzsche, in, 1874, who, diagnosed, a, malignant, historical, fervour, as, one, of, the, crippling, symptoms, of, a, modern, culture, burdened, by, archaeological, study, and, faith, in, the, laws, of, historical, progression, focusing, on, natural, forms, asymmetry, sinuous, lines, and, whiplash, curves, architects, and, designers, aimed, to, escape, the, excessively, ornamental, styles, and, historical, replications, popular, during, the, 19th, century, however, the, style, was, not, completely, new, since, art, nouveau, artists, drew, on, a, huge, range, of, influences, particularly, beaux, arts, architecture, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, aestheticism, and, japanese, art, buildings, used, materials, associated, in, the, 19th, century, with, modernity, such, as, cast, iron, and, glass, a, good, example, of, this, is, the, paris, metro, entrance, at, porte, dauphine, by, hector, guimard, 1900, its, cast, iron, and, glass, canopy, is, as, much, sculpture, as, it, is, architecture, in, paris, art, nouveau, was, even, called, le, style, m, tro, by, some, the, interest, for, stylized, organic, forms, of, ornamentation, originated, in, the, mid, 19th, century, when, it, was, promoted, in, the, grammar, of, ornament, 1854, a, pattern, book, by, british, architect, owen, jones, architect, 1809, 1874, whiplash, curves, and, sinuous, organic, lines, are, its, most, familiar, hallmarks, however, the, style, can, not, be, summarized, only, to, them, since, its, forms, are, much, more, varied, and, complex, the, movement, displayed, many, national, interpretations, depending, on, where, it, manifested, it, was, inspired, by, celtic, art, gothic, revival, rococo, revival, and, baroque, revival, in, hungary, romania, and, poland, for, example, art, nouveau, incorporated, folkloric, elements, this, is, true, especially, in, romania, because, it, facilitated, the, appearance, of, the, romanian, revival, style, which, draws, inspiration, from, br, ncovenesc, architecture, and, traditional, peasant, houses, and, objects, the, style, also, had, different, names, depending, on, countries, in, britain, it, was, known, as, modern, style, in, the, netherlands, as, nieuwe, kunst, in, germany, and, austria, as, jugendstil, in, italy, as, liberty, style, in, romania, as, arta, 1900, and, in, japan, as, shiro, uma, it, would, be, wrong, to, credit, any, particular, place, as, the, only, one, where, the, movement, appeared, since, it, seems, to, have, arisen, in, multiple, locations, rejecting, ornament, and, embracing, minimalism, and, modern, materials, modernist, architecture, appeared, across, the, world, in, the, early, 20th, century, art, nouveau, paved, the, way, for, it, promoting, the, idea, of, non, historicist, styles, it, developed, initially, in, europe, focusing, on, functionalism, and, the, avoidance, of, decoration, modernism, reached, its, peak, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, with, the, bauhaus, and, the, international, style, both, characterised, by, asymmetry, flat, roofs, large, ribbon, windows, metal, glass, white, rendering, and, open, plan, interiors, art, deco, named, retrospectively, after, an, exhibition, held, in, paris, in, 1925, originated, in, france, as, a, luxurious, highly, decorated, style, it, then, spread, quickly, throughout, the, world, most, dramatically, in, the, united, states, becoming, more, streamlined, and, modernistic, through, the, 1930s, the, style, was, pervasive, and, popular, finding, its, way, into, the, design, of, everything, from, jewellery, to, film, sets, from, the, interiors, of, ordinary, homes, to, cinemas, luxury, streamliners, and, hotels, its, exuberance, and, fantasy, captured, the, spirit, of, the, roaring, 20s, and, provided, an, escape, from, the, realities, of, the, great, depression, during, the, 1930s, although, it, ended, with, the, start, of, world, war, ii, its, appeal, has, endured, despite, that, it, is, an, example, of, modern, architecture, elements, of, the, style, drew, on, ancient, egyptian, greek, roman, african, aztec, and, japanese, influences, but, also, on, futurism, cubism, and, the, bauhaus, bold, colours, were, often, applied, on, low, reliefs, predominant, materials, include, chrome, plating, brass, polished, steel, and, aluminium, inlaid, wood, stone, and, stained, glass, the, international, style, emerged, in, europe, after, world, war, i, influenced, by, recent, movements, including, de, stijl, and, streamline, moderne, and, had, a, close, relationship, to, the, bauhaus, the, antithesis, of, nearly, every, other, architectural, movement, that, preceded, it, the, international, style, eliminated, extraneous, ornament, and, used, modern, industrial, materials, such, as, steel, glass, reinforced, concrete, and, chrome, plating, rectilinear, flat, roofed, asymmetrical, and, white, it, became, a, symbol, of, modernity, across, the, world, it, seemed, to, offer, a, crisp, clean, rational, future, after, the, horrors, of, war, named, by, the, architect, philip, johnson, and, historian, henry, russell, hitchcock, 1903, 1987, in, 1932, the, movement, was, epitomized, by, charles, edouard, jeanneret, or, le, corbusier, and, was, clearly, expressed, in, his, statement, that, a, house, is, a, machine, for, living, in, based, on, social, equality, brutalism, was, inspired, by, le, corbusier, s, 1947, 1952, unit, d, habitation, in, marseilles, it, seems, the, term, was, originally, coined, by, swedish, architect, hans, asplund, 1921, 1994, but, le, corbusier, s, use, of, the, description, b, ton, brut, meaning, raw, concrete, for, his, choice, of, material, for, the, unit, d, habitation, was, particularly, influential, the, style, flourished, from, the, 1950s, to, the, mid, 1970s, mainly, using, concrete, which, although, new, in, itself, was, unconventional, when, exposed, on, facades, before, brutalism, concrete, was, usually, hidden, beneath, other, materials, not, one, definable, style, postmodernism, is, an, eclectic, mix, of, approaches, that, appeared, in, the, late, 20th, century, in, reaction, against, modernism, which, was, increasingly, perceived, as, monotonous, and, conservative, as, with, many, movements, a, complete, antithesis, to, modernism, developed, in, 1966, the, architect, robert, venturi, 1925, 2018, had, published, his, book, complexity, and, contradiction, in, architecture, which, praised, the, originality, and, creativity, of, mannerist, and, baroque, architecture, of, rome, and, encouraged, more, ambiguity, and, complexity, in, contemporary, design, complaining, about, the, austerity, and, tedium, of, so, many, smooth, steel, and, glass, modernist, buildings, and, in, deliberate, denunciation, of, the, famous, modernist, less, is, more, venturi, stated, less, is, a, bore, his, theories, became, a, majore, influence, on, the, development, of, postmodernism, deconstructivism, in, architecture, is, a, development, of, postmodern, architecture, that, began, in, the, late, 1980s, it, is, characterized, by, ideas, of, fragmentation, non, linear, processes, of, design, an, interest, in, manipulating, ideas, of, a, structure, s, surface, or, skin, and, apparent, non, euclidean, geometry, i, e, non, rectilinear, shapes, which, serve, to, distort, and, dislocate, some, of, the, elements, of, architecture, such, as, structure, and, envelope, the, finished, visual, appearance, of, buildings, that, exhibit, the, many, deconstructivist, styles, is, characterised, by, a, stimulating, unpredictability, and, a, controlled, chaos, important, events, in, the, history, of, the, deconstructivist, movement, include, the, 1982, parc, de, la, villette, architectural, design, competition, especially, the, entry, from, the, french, philosopher, jacques, derrida, and, the, american, architect, peter, eisenman, and, bernard, tschumi, s, winning, entry, the, museum, of,
