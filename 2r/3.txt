a, civilization, british, english, civilisation, is, any, complex, society, characterized, by, the, development, of, the, state, social, stratification, urbanization, and, symbolic, systems, of, communication, beyond, signed, or, spoken, languages, namely, writing, systems, and, graphic, arts, civilizations, are, often, characterized, by, additional, features, as, well, including, agriculture, architecture, infrastructure, technological, advancement, a, currency, taxation, regulation, and, specialization, of, labour, historically, a, civilization, has, often, been, understood, as, a, larger, and, more, advanced, culture, in, implied, contrast, to, smaller, supposedly, less, advanced, cultures, in, this, broad, sense, a, civilization, contrasts, with, non, centralized, tribal, societies, including, the, cultures, of, nomadic, pastoralists, neolithic, societies, or, hunter, gatherers, however, sometimes, it, also, contrasts, with, the, cultures, found, within, civilizations, themselves, civilizations, are, organized, densely, populated, settlements, divided, into, hierarchical, social, classes, with, a, ruling, elite, and, subordinate, urban, and, rural, populations, which, engage, in, intensive, agriculture, mining, small, scale, manufacture, and, trade, civilization, concentrates, power, extending, human, control, over, the, rest, of, nature, including, over, other, human, beings, the, word, civilization, relates, to, the, latin, civitas, or, city, as, the, national, geographic, society, has, explained, it, this, is, why, the, most, basic, definition, of, the, word, civilization, is, a, society, made, up, of, cities, the, earliest, emergence, of, civilizations, is, generally, connected, with, the, final, stages, of, the, neolithic, revolution, in, west, asia, culminating, in, the, relatively, rapid, process, of, urban, revolution, and, state, formation, a, political, development, associated, with, the, appearance, of, a, governing, elite, the, english, word, civilization, comes, from, the, french, civilis, civilized, from, latin, civilis, civil, related, to, civis, citizen, and, civitas, city, the, fundamental, treatise, is, norbert, elias, s, the, civilizing, process, 1939, which, traces, social, mores, from, medieval, courtly, society, to, the, early, modern, period, in, the, philosophy, of, civilization, 1923, albert, schweitzer, outlines, two, opinions, one, purely, material, and, the, other, material, and, ethical, he, said, that, the, world, crisis, was, from, humanity, losing, the, ethical, idea, of, civilization, the, sum, total, of, all, progress, made, by, man, in, every, sphere, of, action, and, from, every, point, of, view, in, so, far, as, the, progress, helps, towards, the, spiritual, perfecting, of, individuals, as, the, progress, of, all, progress, related, words, like, civility, developed, in, the, mid, 16th, century, the, abstract, noun, civilization, meaning, civilized, condition, came, in, the, 1760, s, again, from, french, the, first, known, use, in, french, is, in, 1757, by, victor, de, riqueti, marquis, de, mirabeau, and, the, first, use, in, english, is, attributed, to, adam, ferguson, who, in, his, 1767, essay, on, the, history, of, civil, society, wrote, not, only, the, individual, advances, from, infancy, to, manhood, but, the, species, itself, from, rudeness, to, civilisation, the, word, was, therefore, opposed, to, barbarism, or, rudeness, in, the, active, pursuit, of, progress, characteristic, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, in, the, late, 1700, s, and, early, 1800, s, during, the, french, revolution, civilization, was, used, in, the, singular, never, in, the, plural, and, meant, the, progress, of, humanity, as, a, whole, this, is, still, the, case, in, french, the, use, of, civilizations, as, a, countable, noun, was, in, occasional, use, in, the, 19th, century, but, has, become, much, more, common, in, the, later, 20th, century, sometimes, just, meaning, culture, itself, in, origin, an, uncountable, noun, made, countable, in, the, context, of, ethnography, only, in, this, generalized, sense, does, it, become, possible, to, speak, of, a, medieval, civilization, which, in, elias, s, sense, would, have, been, an, oxymoron, using, the, terms, civilization, and, culture, as, equivalents, are, controversial, and, generally, rejected, so, that, for, example, some, types, of, culture, are, not, normally, described, as, civilizations, already, in, the, 18th, century, civilization, was, not, always, seen, as, an, improvement, one, historically, important, distinction, between, culture, and, civilization, is, from, the, writings, of, rousseau, particularly, his, work, about, education, emile, here, civilization, being, more, rational, and, socially, driven, is, not, fully, in, accord, with, human, nature, and, human, wholeness, is, achievable, only, through, the, recovery, of, or, approximation, to, an, original, discursive, or, pre, rational, natural, unity, see, noble, savage, from, this, a, new, approach, was, developed, especially, in, germany, first, by, johann, gottfried, herder, and, later, by, philosophers, such, as, kierkegaard, and, nietzsche, this, sees, cultures, as, natural, organisms, not, defined, by, conscious, rational, deliberative, acts, but, a, kind, of, pre, rational, folk, spirit, civilization, in, contrast, though, more, rational, and, more, successful, in, material, progress, is, unnatural, and, leads, to, vices, of, social, life, such, as, guile, hypocrisy, envy, and, avarice, in, world, war, ii, leo, strauss, having, fled, germany, argued, in, new, york, that, this, opinion, of, civilization, was, behind, nazism, and, german, militarism, and, nihilism, social, scientists, such, as, v, gordon, childe, have, named, a, number, of, traits, that, distinguish, a, civilization, from, other, kinds, of, society, civilizations, have, been, distinguished, by, their, means, of, subsistence, types, of, livelihood, settlement, patterns, forms, of, government, social, stratification, economic, systems, literacy, and, other, cultural, traits, andrew, nikiforuk, argues, that, civilizations, relied, on, shackled, human, muscle, it, took, the, energy, of, slaves, to, plant, crops, clothe, emperors, and, build, cities, and, considers, slavery, to, be, a, common, feature, of, pre, modern, civilizations, all, civilizations, have, depended, on, agriculture, for, subsistence, with, the, possible, exception, of, some, early, civilizations, in, peru, which, may, have, depended, upon, maritime, resources, the, traditional, surplus, model, postulates, that, cereal, farming, results, in, accumulated, storage, and, a, surplus, of, food, particularly, when, people, use, intensive, agricultural, techniques, such, as, artificial, fertilization, irrigation, and, crop, rotation, it, is, possible, but, more, difficult, to, accumulate, horticultural, production, and, so, civilizations, based, on, horticultural, gardening, have, been, very, rare, grain, surpluses, have, been, especially, important, because, grain, can, be, stored, for, a, long, time, research, from, the, journal, of, political, economy, contradicts, the, surplus, model, it, postulates, that, horticultural, gardening, was, more, productive, than, cereal, farming, however, only, cereal, farming, produced, civilization, because, of, the, appropriability, of, yearly, harvest, rural, populations, that, could, only, grow, cereals, could, be, taxed, allowing, for, a, taxing, elite, and, urban, development, this, also, had, a, negative, effect, on, rural, population, increasing, relative, agricultural, output, per, farmer, farming, efficiency, created, food, surplus, and, sustained, the, food, surplus, through, decreasing, rural, population, growth, in, favour, of, urban, growth, suitability, of, highly, productive, roots, and, tubers, was, in, fact, a, curse, of, plenty, which, prevented, the, emergence, of, states, and, impeded, economic, development, a, surplus, of, food, permits, some, people, to, do, things, besides, producing, food, for, a, living, early, civilizations, included, soldiers, artisans, priests, and, priestesses, and, other, people, with, specialized, careers, a, surplus, of, food, results, in, a, division, of, labour, and, a, more, diverse, range, of, human, activity, a, defining, trait, of, civilizations, however, in, some, places, hunter, gatherers, have, had, access, to, food, surpluses, such, as, among, some, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, pacific, northwest, and, perhaps, during, the, mesolithic, natufian, culture, it, is, possible, that, food, surpluses, and, relatively, large, scale, social, organization, and, division, of, labour, predates, plant, and, animal, domestication, civilizations, have, distinctly, different, settlement, patterns, from, other, societies, the, word, civilization, is, sometimes, defined, as, living, in, cities, non, farmers, tend, to, gather, in, cities, to, work, and, to, trade, compared, with, other, societies, civilizations, have, a, more, complex, political, structure, namely, the, state, state, societies, are, more, stratified, than, other, societies, there, is, a, greater, difference, among, the, social, classes, the, ruling, class, normally, concentrated, in, the, cities, has, control, over, much, of, the, surplus, and, exercises, its, will, through, the, actions, of, a, government, or, bureaucracy, morton, fried, a, conflict, theorist, and, elman, service, an, integration, theorist, have, classified, human, cultures, based, on, political, systems, and, social, inequality, this, system, of, classification, contains, four, categories, economically, civilizations, display, more, complex, patterns, of, ownership, and, exchange, than, less, organized, societies, living, in, one, place, allows, people, to, accumulate, more, personal, possessions, than, nomadic, people, some, people, also, acquire, landed, property, or, private, ownership, of, the, land, because, a, percentage, of, people, in, civilizations, do, not, grow, their, own, food, they, must, trade, their, goods, and, services, for, food, in, a, market, system, or, receive, food, through, the, levy, of, tribute, redistributive, taxation, tariffs, or, tithes, from, the, food, producing, segment, of, the, population, early, human, cultures, functioned, through, a, gift, economy, supplemented, by, limited, barter, systems, by, the, early, iron, age, contemporary, civilizations, developed, money, as, a, medium, of, exchange, for, increasingly, complex, transactions, in, a, village, the, potter, makes, a, pot, for, the, brewer, and, the, brewer, compensates, the, potter, by, giving, him, a, certain, amount, of, beer, in, a, city, the, potter, may, need, a, new, roof, the, roofer, may, need, new, shoes, the, cobbler, may, need, new, horseshoes, the, blacksmith, may, need, a, new, coat, and, the, tanner, may, need, a, new, pot, these, people, may, not, be, personally, acquainted, with, one, another, and, their, needs, may, not, occur, all, at, the, same, time, a, monetary, system, is, a, way, of, organizing, these, obligations, to, ensure, that, they, are, fulfilled, from, the, days, of, the, earliest, monetarized, civilizations, monopolistic, controls, of, monetary, systems, have, benefited, the, social, and, political, elites, the, transition, from, simpler, to, more, complex, economies, does, not, necessarily, mean, an, improvement, in, the, living, standards, of, the, populace, for, example, although, the, middle, ages, is, often, portrayed, as, an, era, of, decline, from, the, roman, empire, studies, have, shown, that, the, average, stature, of, males, in, the, middle, ages, c, 500, to, 1500, ce, was, greater, than, it, was, for, males, during, the, preceding, roman, empire, and, the, succeeding, early, modern, period, c, 1500, to, 1800, ce, also, the, plains, indians, of, north, america, in, the, 19th, century, were, taller, than, their, civilized, american, and, european, counterparts, the, average, stature, of, a, population, is, a, good, measurement, of, the, adequacy, of, its, access, to, necessities, especially, food, and, its, freedom, from, disease, writing, developed, first, by, people, in, sumer, is, considered, a, hallmark, of, civilization, and, appears, to, accompany, the, rise, of, complex, administrative, bureaucracies, or, the, conquest, state, traders, and, bureaucrats, relied, on, writing, to, keep, accurate, records, like, money, the, writing, was, necessitated, by, the, size, of, the, population, of, a, city, and, the, complexity, of, its, commerce, among, people, who, are, not, all, personally, acquainted, with, each, other, however, writing, is, not, always, necessary, for, civilization, as, shown, by, the, inca, civilization, of, the, andes, which, did, not, use, writing, at, all, but, except, for, a, complex, recording, system, consisting, of, knotted, strings, of, different, lengths, and, colors, the, quipus, and, still, functioned, as, a, civilized, society, aided, by, their, division, of, labour, and, central, government, planning, civilizations, have, developed, many, other, diverse, cultural, traits, these, include, organized, religion, development, in, the, arts, and, countless, new, advances, in, science, and, technology, assessments, of, what, level, of, civilization, a, polity, has, reached, are, based, on, comparisons, of, the, relative, importance, of, agricultural, as, opposed, to, trading, or, manufacturing, capacities, the, territorial, extensions, of, its, power, the, complexity, of, its, division, of, labour, and, the, carrying, capacity, of, its, urban, centres, secondary, elements, include, a, developed, transportation, system, writing, standardized, measurement, currency, contractual, and, tort, based, legal, systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific, understanding, metallurgy, political, structures, and, organized, religion, the, idea, of, civilization, implies, a, progression, or, development, from, a, previous, uncivilized, state, traditionally, cultures, that, defined, themselves, as, civilized, often, did, so, in, contrast, to, other, societies, or, human, groupings, viewed, as, less, civilized, calling, the, latter, barbarians, savages, and, primitives, indeed, the, modern, western, idea, of, civilization, developed, as, a, contrast, to, the, indigenous, cultures, european, settlers, encountered, during, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, and, australia, the, term, primitive, though, once, used, in, anthropology, has, now, been, largely, condemned, by, anthropologists, because, of, its, derogatory, connotations, and, because, it, implies, that, the, cultures, it, refers, to, are, relics, of, a, past, time, that, do, not, change, or, progress, because, of, this, societies, regarding, themselves, as, civilized, have, sometimes, sought, to, dominate, and, assimilate, uncivilized, cultures, into, a, civilized, way, of, living, in, the, 19th, century, the, idea, of, european, culture, as, civilized, and, superior, to, uncivilized, non, european, cultures, was, fully, developed, and, civilization, became, a, core, part, of, european, identity, the, idea, of, civilization, can, also, be, used, as, a, justification, for, dominating, another, culture, and, dispossessing, a, people, of, their, land, for, example, in, australia, british, settlers, justified, the, displacement, of, indigenous, australians, by, observing, that, the, land, appeared, uncultivated, and, wild, which, to, them, reflected, that, the, inhabitants, were, not, civilized, enough, to, improve, it, the, behaviors, and, modes, of, subsistence, that, characterize, civilization, have, been, spread, by, colonization, invasion, religious, conversion, the, extension, of, bureaucratic, control, and, trade, and, by, the, introduction, of, new, technologies, to, cultures, that, did, not, previously, have, them, though, aspects, of, culture, associated, with, civilization, can, be, freely, adopted, through, contact, between, cultures, since, early, modern, times, eurocentric, ideals, of, civilization, have, been, widely, imposed, upon, cultures, through, coercion, and, dominance, these, ideals, complemented, a, philosophy, that, assumed, there, were, innate, differences, between, civilized, and, uncivilized, peoples, civilization, can, also, refer, to, the, culture, of, a, complex, society, not, just, the, society, itself, every, society, civilization, or, not, has, a, specific, set, of, ideas, and, customs, and, a, certain, set, of, manufactures, and, arts, that, make, it, unique, civilizations, tend, to, develop, intricate, cultures, including, a, state, based, decision, making, apparatus, a, literature, professional, art, architecture, organized, religion, and, complex, customs, of, education, coercion, and, control, associated, with, maintaining, the, elite, the, intricate, culture, associated, with, civilization, has, a, tendency, to, spread, to, and, influence, other, cultures, sometimes, assimilating, them, into, the, civilization, a, classic, example, being, chinese, civilization, and, its, influence, on, nearby, civilizations, such, as, korea, japan, and, vietnam, many, civilizations, are, actually, large, cultural, spheres, containing, many, nations, and, regions, the, civilization, in, which, someone, lives, is, that, person, s, broadest, cultural, identity, it, is, precisely, the, protection, of, this, cultural, identity, that, is, becoming, increasingly, important, nationally, and, internationally, according, to, international, law, the, united, nations, and, unesco, try, to, set, up, and, enforce, relevant, rules, the, aim, is, to, preserve, the, cultural, heritage, of, humanity, and, also, the, cultural, identity, especially, in, the, case, of, war, and, armed, conflict, according, to, karl, von, habsburg, president, of, blue, shield, international, the, destruction, of, cultural, assets, is, also, part, of, psychological, warfare, the, target, of, the, attack, is, often, the, opponent, s, cultural, identity, which, is, why, symbolic, cultural, assets, become, a, main, target, it, is, also, intended, to, destroy, the, particularly, sensitive, cultural, memory, museums, archives, monuments, etc, the, grown, cultural, diversity, and, the, economic, basis, such, as, tourism, of, a, state, region, or, community, many, historians, have, focused, on, these, broad, cultural, spheres, and, have, treated, civilizations, as, discrete, units, early, twentieth, century, philosopher, oswald, spengler, uses, the, german, word, kultur, culture, for, what, many, call, a, civilization, spengler, believed, a, civilization, s, coherence, is, based, on, a, single, primary, cultural, symbol, cultures, experience, cycles, of, birth, life, decline, and, death, often, supplanted, by, a, potent, new, culture, formed, around, a, compelling, new, cultural, symbol, spengler, states, civilization, is, the, beginning, of, the, decline, of, a, culture, as, the, most, external, and, artificial, states, of, which, a, species, of, developed, humanity, is, capable, this, unified, culture, concept, of, civilization, also, influenced, the, theories, of, historian, arnold, j, toynbee, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, toynbee, explored, civilization, processes, in, his, multi, volume, a, study, of, history, which, traced, the, rise, and, in, most, cases, the, decline, of, 21, civilizations, and, five, arrested, civilizations, civilizations, generally, declined, and, fell, according, to, toynbee, because, of, the, failure, of, a, creative, minority, through, moral, or, religious, decline, to, meet, some, important, challenge, rather, than, mere, economic, or, environmental, causes, samuel, p, huntington, defines, civilization, as, the, highest, cultural, grouping, of, people, and, the, broadest, level, of, cultural, identity, people, have, short, of, that, which, distinguishes, humans, from, other, species, another, group, of, theorists, making, use, of, systems, theory, looks, at, a, civilization, as, a, complex, system, i, e, a, framework, by, which, a, group, of, objects, can, be, analysed, that, work, in, concert, to, produce, some, result, civilizations, can, be, seen, as, networks, of, cities, that, emerge, from, pre, urban, cultures, and, are, defined, by, the, economic, political, military, diplomatic, social, and, cultural, interactions, among, them, any, organization, is, a, complex, social, system, and, a, civilization, is, a, large, organization, systems, theory, helps, guard, against, superficial, and, misleading, analogies, in, the, study, and, description, of, civilizations, systems, theorists, look, at, many, types, of, relations, between, cities, including, economic, relations, cultural, exchanges, and, political, diplomatic, military, relations, these, spheres, often, occur, on, different, scales, for, example, trade, networks, were, until, the, nineteenth, century, much, larger, than, either, cultural, spheres, or, political, spheres, extensive, trade, routes, including, the, silk, road, through, central, asia, and, indian, ocean, sea, routes, linking, the, roman, empire, persian, empire, india, and, china, were, well, established, 2000, years, ago, when, these, civilizations, scarcely, shared, any, political, diplomatic, military, or, cultural, relations, the, first, evidence, of, such, long, distance, trade, is, in, the, ancient, world, during, the, uruk, period, guillermo, algaze, has, argued, that, trade, relations, connected, egypt, mesopotamia, iran, and, afghanistan, resin, found, later, in, the, royal, cemetery, at, ur, is, suggested, was, traded, northwards, from, mozambique, many, theorists, argue, that, the, entire, world, has, already, become, integrated, into, a, single, world, system, a, process, known, as, globalization, different, civilizations, and, societies, all, over, the, globe, are, economically, politically, and, even, culturally, interdependent, in, many, ways, there, is, debate, over, when, this, integration, began, and, what, sort, of, integration, cultural, technological, economic, political, or, military, diplomatic, is, the, key, indicator, in, determining, the, extent, of, a, civilization, david, wilkinson, has, proposed, that, economic, and, military, diplomatic, integration, of, the, mesopotamian, and, egyptian, civilizations, resulted, in, the, creation, of, what, he, calls, the, central, civilization, around, 1500, bce, central, civilization, later, expanded, to, include, the, entire, middle, east, and, europe, and, then, expanded, to, a, global, scale, with, european, colonization, integrating, the, americas, australia, china, and, japan, by, the, nineteenth, century, according, to, wilkinson, civilizations, can, be, culturally, heterogeneous, like, the, central, civilization, or, homogeneous, like, the, japanese, civilization, what, huntington, calls, the, clash, of, civilizations, might, be, characterized, by, wilkinson, as, a, clash, of, cultural, spheres, within, a, single, global, civilization, others, point, to, the, crusading, movement, as, the, first, step, in, globalization, the, more, conventional, viewpoint, is, that, networks, of, societies, have, expanded, and, shrunk, since, ancient, times, and, that, the, current, globalized, economy, and, culture, is, a, product, of, recent, european, colonialism, the, notion, of, human, history, as, a, succession, of, civilizations, is, an, entirely, modern, one, in, the, european, age, of, discovery, emerging, modernity, was, put, into, stark, contrast, with, the, neolithic, and, mesolithic, stage, of, the, cultures, of, many, of, the, peoples, they, encountered, nonetheless, developments, in, the, neolithic, stage, such, as, agriculture, and, sedentary, settlement, were, critical, to, the, development, of, modern, conceptions, of, civilization, the, natufian, culture, in, the, levantine, corridor, provides, the, earliest, case, of, a, neolithic, revolution, with, the, planting, of, cereal, crops, attested, from, c, 11, 000, bce, the, earliest, neolithic, technology, and, lifestyle, were, established, first, in, western, asia, for, example, at, g, bekli, tepe, from, about, 9, 130, bce, later, in, the, yellow, river, and, yangtze, basins, in, china, for, example, the, peiligang, and, pengtoushan, cultures, and, from, these, cores, spread, across, eurasia, mesopotamia, is, the, site, of, the, earliest, civilizations, developing, from, 7, 400, years, ago, this, area, has, been, evaluated, by, beverley, milton, edwards, as, having, inspired, some, of, the, most, important, developments, in, human, history, including, the, invention, of, the, wheel, the, building, of, the, earliest, cities, and, the, development, of, written, cursive, script, similar, pre, civilized, neolithic, revolutions, also, began, independently, from, 7, 000, bce, in, northwestern, south, america, the, caral, supe, civilization, and, in, mesoamerica, the, black, sea, area, served, as, a, cradle, of, european, civilization, the, site, of, solnitsata, a, prehistoric, fortified, walled, stone, settlement, prehistoric, city, 5500, 4200, bce, is, believed, by, some, archaeologists, to, be, the, oldest, known, town, in, present, day, europe, the, 8, 2, kiloyear, arid, event, and, the, 5, 9, kiloyear, inter, pluvial, saw, the, drying, out, of, semiarid, regions, and, a, major, spread, of, deserts, this, climate, change, shifted, the, cost, benefit, ratio, of, endemic, violence, between, communities, which, saw, the, abandonment, of, unwalled, village, communities, and, the, appearance, of, walled, cities, seen, by, some, as, a, characteristic, of, early, civilizations, this, urban, revolution, a, term, introduced, by, childe, in, the, 1930, s, from, the, 4th, millennium, bce, marked, the, beginning, of, the, accumulation, of, transferable, economic, surpluses, which, helped, economies, and, cities, develop, urban, revolutions, were, associated, with, the, state, monopoly, of, violence, the, appearance, of, a, warrior, or, soldier, class, and, endemic, warfare, a, state, of, continual, or, frequent, warfare, the, rapid, development, of, hierarchies, and, the, use, of, human, sacrifice, the, civilized, urban, revolution, in, turn, was, dependent, upon, the, development, of, sedentism, the, domestication, of, grains, plants, and, animals, the, permanence, of, settlements, and, development, of, lifestyles, that, facilitated, economies, of, scale, and, accumulation, of, surplus, production, by, particular, social, sectors, the, transition, from, complex, cultures, to, civilizations, while, still, disputed, seems, to, be, associated, with, the, development, of, state, structures, in, which, power, was, further, monopolized, by, an, elite, ruling, class, who, practiced, human, sacrifice, towards, the, end, of, the, neolithic, period, various, elitist, chalcolithic, civilizations, began, to, rise, in, various, cradles, from, around, 3600, bce, beginning, with, mesopotamia, expanding, into, large, scale, kingdoms, and, empires, in, the, course, of, the, bronze, age, akkadian, empire, indus, valley, civilization, old, kingdom, of, egypt, neo, sumerian, empire, middle, assyrian, empire, babylonian, empire, hittite, empire, and, to, some, degree, the, territorial, expansions, of, the, elamites, hurrians, amorites, and, ebla, outside, the, old, world, a, later, development, took, place, independently, in, the, pre, columbian, americas, urbanization, in, the, norte, chico, civilization, in, coastal, peru, emerged, about, 3200, bce, the, oldest, known, mayan, city, located, in, guatemala, dates, to, about, 750, bce, and, teotihuacan, in, mexico, was, one, of, the, largest, cities, in, the, world, in, 350, ce, with, a, population, of, about, 125, 000, the, bronze, age, collapse, was, followed, by, the, iron, age, around, 1200, bce, during, which, a, number, of, new, civilizations, emerged, culminating, in, a, period, from, the, 8th, to, the, 3rd, century, bce, which, karl, jaspers, termed, the, axial, age, presented, as, a, critical, transitional, phase, leading, to, classical, civilization, a, major, technological, and, cultural, transition, to, modernity, began, approximately, 1500, ce, in, western, europe, and, from, this, beginning, new, approaches, to, science, and, law, spread, rapidly, around, the, world, incorporating, earlier, cultures, into, the, technological, and, industrial, society, of, the, present, civilizations, are, traditionally, understood, as, ending, in, one, of, two, ways, either, through, incorporation, into, another, expanding, civilization, e, g, as, ancient, egypt, was, incorporated, into, hellenistic, greek, and, subsequently, roman, civilizations, or, by, collapsing, and, reverting, to, a, simpler, form, of, living, as, happens, in, so, called, dark, ages, there, have, been, many, explanations, put, forward, for, the, collapse, of, civilization, some, focus, on, historical, examples, and, others, on, general, theory, according, to, political, scientist, samuel, p, huntington, the, 21st, century, will, be, characterized, by, a, clash, of, civilizations, which, he, believes, will, replace, the, conflicts, between, nation, states, and, ideologies, that, were, prominent, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, however, this, viewpoint, been, strongly, challenged, by, others, such, as, edward, said, muhammed, asadi, and, amartya, sen, ronald, inglehart, and, pippa, norris, have, argued, that, the, true, clash, of, civilizations, between, the, muslim, world, and, the, west, is, caused, by, the, muslim, rejection, of, the, west, s, more, liberal, sexual, values, rather, than, a, difference, in, political, ideology, although, they, note, that, this, lack, of, tolerance, is, likely, to, lead, to, an, eventual, rejection, of, true, democracy, in, identity, and, violence, sen, questions, if, people, should, be, divided, along, the, lines, of, a, supposed, civilization, defined, by, religion, and, culture, only, he, argues, that, this, ignores, the, many, others, identities, that, make, up, people, and, leads, to, a, focus, on, differences, cultural, historian, morris, berman, argues, in, dark, ages, america, the, end, of, empire, that, in, the, corporate, consumerist, united, states, the, very, factors, that, once, propelled, it, to, greatness, extreme, individualism, territorial, and, economic, expansion, and, the, pursuit, of, material, wealth, have, pushed, the, united, states, across, a, critical, threshold, where, collapse, is, inevitable, politically, associated, with, over, reach, and, as, a, result, of, the, environmental, exhaustion, and, polarization, of, wealth, between, rich, and, poor, he, concludes, the, current, system, is, fast, arriving, at, a, situation, where, continuation, of, the, existing, system, saddled, with, huge, deficits, and, a, hollowed, out, economy, is, physically, socially, economically, and, politically, impossible, although, developed, in, much, more, depth, berman, s, thesis, is, similar, in, some, ways, to, that, of, urban, planner, jane, jacobs, who, argues, that, the, five, pillars, of, united, states, culture, are, in, serious, decay, community, and, family, higher, education, the, effective, practice, of, science, taxation, and, government, and, the, self, regulation, of, the, learned, professions, the, corrosion, of, these, pillars, jacobs, argues, is, linked, to, societal, ills, such, as, environmental, crisis, racism, and, the, growing, gulf, between, rich, and, poor, cultural, critic, and, author, derrick, jensen, argues, that, modern, civilization, is, directed, towards, the, domination, of, the, environment, and, humanity, itself, in, an, intrinsically, harmful, unsustainable, and, self, destructive, fashion, defending, his, definition, both, linguistically, and, historically, he, defines, civilization, as, a, culture, that, both, leads, to, and, emerges, from, the, growth, of, cities, with, cities, defined, as, people, living, more, or, less, permanently, in, one, place, in, densities, high, enough, to, require, the, routine, importation, of, food, and, other, necessities, of, life, this, need, for, civilizations, to, import, ever, more, resources, he, argues, stems, from, their, over, exploitation, and, diminution, of, their, own, local, resources, therefore, civilizations, inherently, adopt, imperialist, and, expansionist, policies, and, to, maintain, these, highly, militarized, hierarchically, structured, and, coercion, based, cultures, and, lifestyles, the, kardashev, scale, classifies, civilizations, based, on, their, level, of, technological, advancement, specifically, measured, by, the, amount, of, energy, a, civilization, is, able, to, harness, the, scale, is, only, hypothetical, but, it, puts, energy, consumption, in, a, cosmic, perspective, the, kardashev, scale, makes, provisions, for, civilizations, far, more, technologically, advanced, than, any, currently, known, to, exist, the, current, scientific, consensus, is, that, human, beings, are, the, only, animal, species, with, the, cognitive, ability, to, create, civilizations, that, has, emerged, on, earth, a, recent, thought, experiment, the, silurian, hypothesis, however, considers, whether, it, would, be, possible, to, detect, an, industrial, civilization, in, the, geological, record, given, the, paucity, of, geological, information, about, eras, before, the, quaternary, astronomers, speculate, about, the, existence, of, communicating, intelligent, civilizations, within, and, beyond, the, milky, way, galaxy, usually, using, variants, of, the, drake, equation, they, conduct, searches, for, such, intelligences, such, as, for, technological, traces, called, technosignatures, the, proposed, proto, scientific, field, xenoarchaeology, is, concerned, with, the, study, of, artifact, remains, of, non, human, civilizations, to, reconstruct, and, interpret, past, lives, of, alien, societies, if, such, get, discovered, and, confirmed, scientifically
