the, neolithic, or, new, stone, age, from, greek, n, os, new, and, l, thos, stone, is, an, archaeological, period, the, final, division, of, the, stone, age, in, europe, asia, mesopotamia, and, africa, c, 10, 000, bc, to, c, 2, 000, bc, it, saw, the, neolithic, revolution, a, wide, ranging, set, of, developments, that, appear, to, have, arisen, independently, in, several, parts, of, the, world, this, neolithic, package, included, the, introduction, of, farming, domestication, of, animals, and, change, from, a, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, to, one, of, settlement, the, term, neolithic, was, coined, by, sir, john, lubbock, in, 1865, as, a, refinement, of, the, three, age, system, the, neolithic, began, about, 12, 000, years, ago, when, farming, appeared, in, the, epipalaeolithic, near, east, and, mesopotamia, and, later, in, other, parts, of, the, world, it, lasted, in, the, near, east, until, the, transitional, period, of, the, chalcolithic, copper, age, from, about, 6, 500, years, ago, 4500, bc, marked, by, the, development, of, metallurgy, leading, up, to, the, bronze, age, and, iron, age, in, other, places, the, neolithic, followed, the, mesolithic, middle, stone, age, and, then, lasted, until, later, in, ancient, egypt, the, neolithic, lasted, until, the, protodynastic, period, c, 3150, bc, in, china, it, lasted, until, circa, 2000, bc, with, the, rise, of, the, pre, shang, erlitou, culture, as, it, did, in, scandinavia, following, the, aspro, chronology, the, neolithic, started, in, around, 10, 200, bc, in, the, levant, arising, from, the, natufian, culture, when, pioneering, use, of, wild, cereals, evolved, into, early, farming, the, natufian, period, or, proto, neolithic, lasted, from, 12, 500, to, 9, 500, bc, and, is, taken, to, overlap, with, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, ppna, of, 10, 200, 8800, bc, as, the, natufians, had, become, dependent, on, wild, cereals, in, their, diet, and, a, sedentary, way, of, life, had, begun, among, them, the, climatic, changes, associated, with, the, younger, dryas, about, 10, 000, bc, are, thought, to, have, forced, people, to, develop, farming, the, founder, crops, of, the, fertile, crescent, were, wheat, lentil, pea, chickpeas, bitter, vetch, and, flax, among, the, other, major, crop, domesticated, were, rice, millet, maize, corn, and, potatoes, crops, were, usually, domesticated, in, a, single, location, and, ancestral, wild, species, are, still, found, early, neolithic, farming, was, limited, to, a, narrow, range, of, plants, both, wild, and, domesticated, which, included, einkorn, wheat, millet, and, spelt, and, the, keeping, of, dogs, by, about, 8000, bc, it, included, domesticated, sheep, and, goats, cattle, and, pigs, not, all, of, these, cultural, elements, characteristic, of, the, neolithic, appeared, everywhere, in, the, same, order, the, earliest, farming, societies, in, the, near, east, did, not, use, pottery, in, other, parts, of, the, world, such, as, africa, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, independent, domestication, events, led, to, their, own, regionally, distinctive, neolithic, cultures, which, arose, completely, independently, of, those, in, europe, and, southwest, asia, early, japanese, societies, and, other, east, asian, cultures, used, pottery, before, developing, agriculture, in, the, middle, east, cultures, identified, as, neolithic, began, appearing, in, the, 10th, millennium, bc, early, development, occurred, in, the, levant, e, g, pre, pottery, neolithic, a, and, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, and, from, there, spread, eastwards, and, westwards, neolithic, cultures, are, also, attested, in, southeastern, anatolia, and, northern, mesopotamia, by, around, 8000, bc, anatolian, neolithic, farmers, derived, a, significant, portion, of, their, ancestry, from, the, anatolian, hunter, gatherers, ahg, suggesting, that, agriculture, was, adopted, in, site, by, these, hunter, gatherers, and, not, spread, by, demic, diffusion, into, the, region, the, neolithic, 1, ppna, period, began, around, 10, 000, bc, in, the, levant, a, temple, area, in, southeastern, turkey, at, g, bekli, tepe, dated, to, around, 9500, bc, may, be, regarded, as, the, beginning, of, the, period, this, site, was, developed, by, nomadic, hunter, gatherer, tribes, as, evidenced, by, the, lack, of, permanent, housing, in, the, vicinity, and, may, be, the, oldest, known, human, made, place, of, worship, at, least, seven, stone, circles, covering, 25, acres, 10, ha, contain, limestone, pillars, carved, with, animals, insects, and, birds, stone, tools, were, used, by, perhaps, as, many, as, hundreds, of, people, to, create, the, pillars, which, might, have, supported, roofs, other, early, ppna, sites, dating, to, around, 9500, 9000, bc, have, been, found, in, tell, es, sultan, ancient, jericho, israel, notably, ain, mallaha, nahal, oren, and, kfar, hahoresh, gilgal, in, the, jordan, valley, and, byblos, lebanon, the, start, of, neolithic, 1, overlaps, the, tahunian, and, heavy, neolithic, periods, to, some, degree, the, major, advance, of, neolithic, 1, was, true, farming, in, the, proto, neolithic, natufian, cultures, wild, cereals, were, harvested, and, perhaps, early, seed, selection, and, re, seeding, occurred, the, grain, was, ground, into, flour, emmer, wheat, was, domesticated, and, animals, were, herded, and, domesticated, animal, husbandry, and, selective, breeding, in, 2006, remains, of, figs, were, discovered, in, a, house, in, jericho, dated, to, 9400, bc, the, figs, are, of, a, mutant, variety, that, cannot, be, pollinated, by, insects, and, therefore, the, trees, can, only, reproduce, from, cuttings, this, evidence, suggests, that, figs, were, the, first, cultivated, crop, and, mark, the, invention, of, the, technology, of, farming, this, occurred, centuries, before, the, first, cultivation, of, grains, settlements, became, more, permanent, with, circular, houses, much, like, those, of, the, natufians, with, single, rooms, however, these, houses, were, for, the, first, time, made, of, mudbrick, the, settlement, had, a, surrounding, stone, wall, and, perhaps, a, stone, tower, as, in, jericho, the, wall, served, as, protection, from, nearby, groups, as, protection, from, floods, or, to, keep, animals, penned, some, of, the, enclosures, also, suggest, grain, and, meat, storage, the, neolithic, 2, ppnb, began, around, 8800, bc, according, to, the, aspro, chronology, in, the, levant, jericho, west, bank, as, with, the, ppna, dates, there, are, two, versions, from, the, same, laboratories, noted, above, this, system, of, terminology, however, is, not, convenient, for, southeast, anatolia, and, settlements, of, the, middle, anatolia, basin, a, settlement, of, 3, 000, inhabitants, called, ain, ghazal, was, found, in, the, outskirts, of, amman, jordan, considered, to, be, one, of, the, largest, prehistoric, settlements, in, the, near, east, it, was, continuously, inhabited, from, approximately, 7250, bc, to, approximately, 5000, bc, settlements, have, rectangular, mud, brick, houses, where, the, family, lived, together, in, single, or, multiple, rooms, burial, findings, suggest, an, ancestor, cult, where, people, preserved, skulls, of, the, dead, which, were, plastered, with, mud, to, make, facial, features, the, rest, of, the, corpse, could, have, been, left, outside, the, settlement, to, decay, until, only, the, bones, were, left, then, the, bones, were, buried, inside, the, settlement, underneath, the, floor, or, between, houses, work, at, the, site, of, ain, ghazal, in, jordan, has, indicated, a, later, pre, pottery, neolithic, c, period, juris, zarins, has, proposed, that, a, circum, arabian, nomadic, pastoral, complex, developed, in, the, period, from, the, climatic, crisis, of, 6200, bc, partly, as, a, result, of, an, increasing, emphasis, in, ppnb, cultures, upon, domesticated, animals, and, a, fusion, with, harifian, hunter, gatherers, in, the, southern, levant, with, affiliate, connections, with, the, cultures, of, fayyum, and, the, eastern, desert, of, egypt, cultures, practicing, this, lifestyle, spread, down, the, red, sea, shoreline, and, moved, east, from, syria, into, southern, iraq, the, late, neolithic, began, around, 6, 400, bc, in, the, fertile, crescent, by, then, distinctive, cultures, emerged, with, pottery, like, the, halafian, turkey, syria, northern, mesopotamia, and, ubaid, southern, mesopotamia, this, period, has, been, further, divided, into, pna, pottery, neolithic, a, and, pnb, pottery, neolithic, b, at, some, sites, the, chalcolithic, stone, bronze, period, began, about, 4500, bc, then, the, bronze, age, began, about, 3500, bc, replacing, the, neolithic, cultures, around, 10, 000, bc, the, first, fully, developed, neolithic, cultures, belonging, to, the, phase, pre, pottery, neolithic, a, ppna, appeared, in, the, fertile, crescent, around, 10, 700, 9400, bc, a, settlement, was, established, in, tell, qaramel, 10, miles, 16, km, north, of, aleppo, the, settlement, included, two, temples, dating, to, 9650, bc, around, 9000, bc, during, the, ppna, one, of, the, world, s, first, towns, jericho, appeared, in, the, levant, it, was, surrounded, by, a, stone, wall, may, have, contained, a, population, of, up, to, 2, 000, 3, 000, people, and, contained, a, massive, stone, tower, around, 6400, bc, the, halaf, culture, appeared, in, syria, and, northern, mesopotamia, in, 1981, a, team, of, researchers, from, the, maison, de, l, orient, et, de, la, m, diterran, e, including, jacques, cauvin, and, oliver, aurenche, divided, near, east, neolithic, chronology, into, ten, periods, 0, to, 9, based, on, social, economic, and, cultural, characteristics, in, 2002, danielle, stordeur, and, fr, d, ric, abb, s, advanced, this, system, with, a, division, into, five, periods, they, also, advanced, the, idea, of, a, transitional, stage, between, the, ppna, and, ppnb, between, 8800, and, 8600, bc, at, sites, like, jerf, el, ahmar, and, tell, aswad, alluvial, plains, sumer, elam, low, rainfall, makes, irrigation, systems, necessary, ubaid, culture, from, 6, 900, bc, the, earliest, evidence, of, neolithic, culture, in, northeast, africa, was, found, in, the, archaeological, sites, of, bir, kiseiba, and, nabta, playa, in, what, is, now, southwest, egypt, domestication, of, sheep, and, goats, reached, egypt, from, the, near, east, possibly, as, early, as, 6000, bc, graeme, barker, states, the, first, indisputable, evidence, for, domestic, plants, and, animals, in, the, nile, valley, is, not, until, the, early, fifth, millennium, bc, in, northern, egypt, and, a, thousand, years, later, further, south, in, both, cases, as, part, of, strategies, that, still, relied, heavily, on, fishing, hunting, and, the, gathering, of, wild, plants, and, suggests, that, these, subsistence, changes, were, not, due, to, farmers, migrating, from, the, near, east, but, was, an, indigenous, development, with, cereals, either, indigenous, or, obtained, through, exchange, other, scholars, argue, that, the, primary, stimulus, for, agriculture, and, domesticated, animals, as, well, as, mud, brick, architecture, and, other, neolithic, cultural, features, in, egypt, was, from, the, middle, east, the, neolithization, of, northwestern, africa, was, initiated, by, iberian, levantine, and, perhaps, sicilian, migrants, around, 5500, 5300, bc, during, the, early, neolithic, period, farming, was, introduced, by, europeans, and, was, subsequently, adopted, by, the, locals, during, the, middle, neolithic, period, an, influx, of, ancestry, from, the, levant, appeared, in, northwestern, africa, coinciding, with, the, arrival, of, pastoralism, in, the, region, the, earliest, evidence, for, pottery, domestic, cereals, and, animal, husbandry, is, found, in, morocco, specifically, at, kaf, el, ghar, the, pastoral, neolithic, was, a, period, in, africa, s, prehistory, marking, the, beginning, of, food, production, on, the, continent, following, the, later, stone, age, in, contrast, to, the, neolithic, in, other, parts, of, the, world, which, saw, the, development, of, farming, societies, the, first, form, of, african, food, production, was, mobile, pastoralism, or, ways, of, life, centered, on, the, herding, and, management, of, livestock, the, term, pastoral, neolithic, is, used, most, often, by, archaeologists, to, describe, early, pastoralist, periods, in, the, sahara, as, well, as, in, eastern, africa, the, savanna, pastoral, neolithic, or, spn, formerly, known, as, the, stone, bowl, culture, is, a, collection, of, ancient, societies, that, appeared, in, the, rift, valley, of, east, africa, and, surrounding, areas, during, a, time, period, known, as, the, pastoral, neolithic, they, were, south, cushitic, speaking, pastoralists, who, tended, to, bury, their, dead, in, cairns, whilst, their, toolkit, was, characterized, by, stone, bowls, pestles, grindstones, and, earthenware, pots, through, archaeology, historical, linguistics, and, archaeogenetics, they, conventionally, have, been, identified, with, the, area, s, first, afroasiatic, speaking, settlers, archaeological, dating, of, livestock, bones, and, burial, cairns, has, also, established, the, cultural, complex, as, the, earliest, center, of, pastoralism, and, stone, construction, in, the, region, in, southeast, europe, agrarian, societies, first, appeared, in, the, 7th, millennium, bc, attested, by, one, of, the, earliest, farming, sites, of, europe, discovered, in, vasht, mi, southeastern, albania, and, dating, back, to, 6500, bc, in, most, of, western, europe, in, followed, over, the, next, two, thousand, years, but, in, some, parts, of, northwest, europe, it, is, much, later, lasting, just, under, 3, 000, years, from, c, 4500, bc, 1700, bc, recent, advances, in, archaeogenetics, have, confirmed, that, the, spread, of, agriculture, from, the, middle, east, to, europe, was, strongly, correlated, with, the, migration, of, early, farmers, from, anatolia, about, 9, 000, years, ago, and, was, not, just, a, cultural, exchange, anthropomorphic, figurines, have, been, found, in, the, balkans, from, 6000, bc, and, in, central, europe, by, around, 5800, bc, la, hoguette, among, the, earliest, cultural, complexes, of, this, area, are, the, sesklo, culture, in, thessaly, which, later, expanded, in, the, balkans, giving, rise, to, star, evo, k, r, s, cris, linearbandkeramik, and, vin, a, through, a, combination, of, cultural, diffusion, and, migration, of, peoples, the, neolithic, traditions, spread, west, and, northwards, to, reach, northwestern, europe, by, around, 4500, bc, the, vin, a, culture, may, have, created, the, earliest, system, of, writing, the, vin, a, signs, though, archaeologist, shan, winn, believes, they, most, likely, represented, pictograms, and, ideograms, rather, than, a, truly, developed, form, of, writing, the, cucuteni, trypillian, culture, built, enormous, settlements, in, romania, moldova, and, ukraine, from, 5300, to, 2300, bc, the, megalithic, temple, complexes, of, gantija, on, the, mediterranean, island, of, gozo, in, the, maltese, archipelago, and, of, mnajdra, malta, are, notable, for, their, gigantic, neolithic, structures, the, oldest, of, which, date, back, to, around, 3600, bc, the, hypogeum, of, al, saflieni, paola, malta, is, a, subterranean, structure, excavated, around, 2500, bc, originally, a, sanctuary, it, became, a, necropolis, the, only, prehistoric, underground, temple, in, the, world, and, shows, a, degree, of, artistry, in, stone, sculpture, unique, in, prehistory, to, the, maltese, islands, after, 2500, bc, these, islands, were, depopulated, for, several, decades, until, the, arrival, of, a, new, influx, of, bronze, age, immigrants, a, culture, that, cremated, its, dead, and, introduced, smaller, megalithic, structures, called, dolmens, to, malta, in, most, cases, there, are, small, chambers, here, with, the, cover, made, of, a, large, slab, placed, on, upright, stones, they, are, claimed, to, belong, to, a, population, different, from, that, which, built, the, previous, megalithic, temples, it, is, presumed, the, population, arrived, from, sicily, because, of, the, similarity, of, maltese, dolmens, to, some, small, constructions, found, there, with, some, exceptions, population, levels, rose, rapidly, at, the, beginning, of, the, neolithic, until, they, reached, the, carrying, capacity, this, was, followed, by, a, population, crash, of, enormous, magnitude, after, 5000, bc, with, levels, remaining, low, during, the, next, 1, 500, years, populations, began, to, rise, after, 3500, bc, with, further, dips, and, rises, occurring, between, 3000, and, 2500, bc, but, varying, in, date, between, regions, around, this, time, is, the, neolithic, decline, when, populations, collapsed, across, most, of, europe, possibly, caused, by, climatic, conditions, plague, or, mass, migration, settled, life, encompassing, the, transition, from, foraging, to, farming, and, pastoralism, began, in, south, asia, in, the, region, of, balochistan, pakistan, around, 7, 000, bc, at, the, site, of, mehrgarh, balochistan, presence, can, be, documented, of, the, domestication, of, wheat, and, barley, rapidly, followed, by, that, of, goats, sheep, and, cattle, in, april, 2006, it, was, announced, in, the, scientific, journal, nature, that, the, oldest, and, first, early, neolithic, evidence, for, the, drilling, of, teeth, in, vivo, using, bow, drills, and, flint, tips, was, found, in, mehrgarh, in, south, india, the, neolithic, began, by, 6500, bc, and, lasted, until, around, 1400, bc, when, the, megalithic, transition, period, began, south, indian, neolithic, is, characterized, by, ash, mounds, from, 2500, bc, in, karnataka, region, expanded, later, to, tamil, nadu, in, east, asia, the, earliest, sites, include, the, nanzhuangtou, culture, around, 9500, 9000, bc, pengtoushan, culture, around, 7500, 6100, bc, and, peiligang, culture, around, 7000, 5000, bc, the, prehistoric, beifudi, site, near, yixian, in, hebei, province, china, contains, relics, of, a, culture, contemporaneous, with, the, cishan, and, xinglongwa, cultures, of, about, 6000, 5000, bc, neolithic, cultures, east, of, the, taihang, mountains, filling, in, an, archaeological, gap, between, the, two, northern, chinese, cultures, the, total, excavated, area, is, more, than, 1, 200, square, yards, 1, 000, m, 2, 0, 10, ha, and, the, collection, of, neolithic, findings, at, the, site, encompasses, two, phases, between, 3000, and, 1900, bc, the, longshan, culture, existed, in, the, middle, and, lower, yellow, river, valley, areas, of, northern, china, towards, the, end, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, the, population, decreased, sharply, in, most, of, the, region, and, many, of, the, larger, centres, were, abandoned, possibly, due, to, environmental, change, linked, to, the, end, of, the, holocene, climatic, optimum, the, neolithic, defined, in, this, paragraph, as, using, polished, stone, implements, remains, a, living, tradition, in, small, and, extremely, remote, and, inaccessible, pockets, of, west, papua, polished, stone, adze, and, axes, are, used, in, the, present, day, as, of, 2008, in, areas, where, the, availability, of, metal, implements, is, limited, this, is, likely, to, cease, altogether, in, the, next, few, years, as, the, older, generation, die, off, and, steel, blades, and, chainsaws, prevail, in, 2012, news, was, released, about, a, new, farming, site, discovered, in, munam, ri, goseong, gangwon, province, south, korea, which, may, be, the, earliest, farmland, known, to, date, in, east, asia, no, remains, of, an, agricultural, field, from, the, neolithic, period, have, been, found, in, any, east, asian, country, before, the, institute, said, adding, that, the, discovery, reveals, that, the, history, of, agricultural, cultivation, at, least, began, during, the, period, on, the, korean, peninsula, the, farm, was, dated, between, 3600, and, 3000, bc, pottery, stone, projectile, points, and, possible, houses, were, also, found, in, 2002, researchers, discovered, prehistoric, earthenware, jade, earrings, among, other, items, in, the, area, the, research, team, will, perform, accelerator, mass, spectrometry, ams, dating, to, retrieve, a, more, precise, date, for, the, site, in, mesoamerica, a, similar, set, of, events, i, e, crop, domestication, and, sedentary, lifestyles, occurred, by, around, 4500, bc, in, south, america, but, possibly, as, early, as, 11, 000, 10, 000, bc, these, cultures, are, usually, not, referred, to, as, belonging, to, the, neolithic, in, america, different, terms, are, used, such, as, formative, stage, instead, of, mid, late, neolithic, archaic, era, instead, of, early, neolithic, and, paleo, indian, for, the, preceding, period, the, formative, stage, is, equivalent, to, the, neolithic, revolution, period, in, europe, asia, and, africa, in, the, southwestern, united, states, it, occurred, from, 500, to, 1200, ad, when, there, was, a, dramatic, increase, in, population, and, development, of, large, villages, supported, by, agriculture, based, on, dryland, farming, of, maize, and, later, beans, squash, and, domesticated, turkeys, during, this, period, the, bow, and, arrow, and, ceramic, pottery, were, also, introduced, in, later, periods, cities, of, considerable, size, developed, and, some, metallurgy, by, 700, bc, australia, in, contrast, to, new, guinea, has, generally, been, held, not, to, have, had, a, neolithic, period, with, a, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, continuing, until, the, arrival, of, europeans, this, view, can, be, challenged, in, terms, of, the, definition, of, agriculture, but, neolithic, remains, a, rarely, used, and, not, very, useful, concept, in, discussing, australian, prehistory, during, most, of, the, neolithic, age, of, eurasia, people, lived, in, small, tribes, composed, of, multiple, bands, or, lineages, there, is, little, scientific, evidence, of, developed, social, stratification, in, most, neolithic, societies, social, stratification, is, more, associated, with, the, later, bronze, age, although, some, late, eurasian, neolithic, societies, formed, complex, stratified, chiefdoms, or, even, states, generally, states, evolved, in, eurasia, only, with, the, rise, of, metallurgy, and, most, neolithic, societies, on, the, whole, were, relatively, simple, and, egalitarian, beyond, eurasia, however, states, were, formed, during, the, local, neolithic, in, three, areas, namely, in, the, preceramic, andes, with, the, norte, chico, civilization, formative, mesoamerica, and, ancient, hawai, i, however, most, neolithic, societies, were, noticeably, more, hierarchical, than, the, upper, paleolithic, cultures, that, preceded, them, and, hunter, gatherer, cultures, in, general, the, domestication, of, large, animals, c, 8000, bc, resulted, in, a, dramatic, increase, in, social, inequality, in, most, of, the, areas, where, it, occurred, new, guinea, being, a, notable, exception, possession, of, livestock, allowed, competition, between, households, and, resulted, in, inherited, inequalities, of, wealth, neolithic, pastoralists, who, controlled, large, herds, gradually, acquired, more, livestock, and, this, made, economic, inequalities, more, pronounced, however, evidence, of, social, inequality, is, still, disputed, as, settlements, such, as, atalh, y, k, reveal, a, lack, of, difference, in, the, size, of, homes, and, burial, sites, suggesting, a, more, egalitarian, society, with, no, evidence, of, the, concept, of, capital, although, some, homes, do, appear, slightly, larger, or, more, elaborately, decorated, than, others, families, and, households, were, still, largely, independent, economically, and, the, household, was, probably, the, center, of, life, however, excavations, in, central, europe, have, revealed, that, early, neolithic, linear, ceramic, cultures, linearbandkeramik, were, building, large, arrangements, of, circular, ditches, between, 4800, and, 4600, bc, these, structures, and, their, later, counterparts, such, as, causewayed, enclosures, burial, mounds, and, henge, required, considerable, time, and, labour, to, construct, which, suggests, that, some, influential, individuals, were, able, to, organise, and, direct, human, labour, though, non, hierarchical, and, voluntary, work, remain, possibilities, there, is, a, large, body, of, evidence, for, fortified, settlements, at, linearbandkeramik, sites, along, the, rhine, as, at, least, some, villages, were, fortified, for, some, time, with, a, palisade, and, an, outer, ditch, settlements, with, palisades, and, weapon, traumatized, bones, such, as, those, found, at, the, talheim, death, pit, have, been, discovered, and, demonstrate, that, systematic, violence, between, groups, and, warfare, was, probably, much, more, common, during, the, neolithic, than, in, the, preceding, paleolithic, period, this, supplanted, an, earlier, view, of, the, linear, pottery, culture, as, living, a, peaceful, unfortified, lifestyle, control, of, labour, and, inter, group, conflict, is, characteristic, of, tribal, groups, with, social, rank, that, are, headed, by, a, charismatic, individual, either, a, big, man, or, a, proto, chief, functioning, as, a, lineage, group, head, whether, a, non, hierarchical, system, of, organization, existed, is, debatable, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, explicitly, suggests, that, neolithic, societies, functioned, under, any, dominating, class, or, individual, as, was, the, case, in, the, chiefdoms, of, the, european, early, bronze, age, possible, exceptions, to, this, include, iraq, during, the, ubaid, period, and, england, beginning, in, the, early, neolithic, 4100, 3000, bc, theories, to, explain, the, apparent, implied, egalitarianism, of, neolithic, and, paleolithic, societies, have, arisen, notably, the, marxist, concept, of, primitive, communism, the, shelter, of, early, people, changed, dramatically, from, the, upper, paleolithic, to, the, neolithic, era, in, the, paleolithic, people, did, not, normally, live, in, permanent, constructions, in, the, neolithic, mud, brick, houses, started, appearing, that, were, coated, with, plaster, the, growth, of, agriculture, made, permanent, houses, far, more, common, at, atalh, y, k, 9, 000, years, ago, doorways, were, made, on, the, roof, with, ladders, positioned, both, on, the, inside, and, outside, of, the, houses, stilt, house, settlements, were, common, in, the, alpine, and, pianura, padana, terramare, region, remains, have, been, found, in, the, ljubljana, marsh, in, slovenia, and, at, the, mondsee, and, attersee, lakes, in, upper, austria, for, example, a, significant, and, far, reaching, shift, in, human, subsistence, and, lifestyle, was, to, be, brought, about, in, areas, where, crop, farming, and, cultivation, were, first, developed, the, previous, reliance, on, an, essentially, nomadic, hunter, gatherer, subsistence, technique, or, pastoral, transhumance, was, at, first, supplemented, and, then, increasingly, replaced, by, a, reliance, upon, the, foods, produced, from, cultivated, lands, these, developments, are, also, believed, to, have, greatly, encouraged, the, growth, of, settlements, since, it, may, be, supposed, that, the, increased, need, to, spend, more, time, and, labor, in, tending, crop, fields, required, more, localized, dwellings, this, trend, would, continue, into, the, bronze, age, eventually, giving, rise, to, permanently, settled, farming, towns, and, later, cities, and, states, whose, larger, populations, could, be, sustained, by, the, increased, productivity, from, cultivated, lands, the, profound, differences, in, human, interactions, and, subsistence, methods, associated, with, the, onset, of, early, agricultural, practices, in, the, neolithic, have, been, called, the, neolithic, revolution, a, term, coined, in, the, 1920s, by, the, australian, archaeologist, vere, gordon, childe, one, potential, benefit, of, the, development, and, increasing, sophistication, of, farming, technology, was, the, possibility, of, producing, surplus, crop, yields, in, other, words, food, supplies, in, excess, of, the, immediate, needs, of, the, community, surpluses, could, be, stored, for, later, use, or, possibly, traded, for, other, necessities, or, luxuries, agricultural, life, afforded, securities, that, nomadic, life, could, not, and, sedentary, farming, populations, grew, faster, than, nomadic, however, early, farmers, were, also, adversely, affected, in, times, of, famine, such, as, may, be, caused, by, drought, or, pests, in, instances, where, agriculture, had, become, the, predominant, way, of, life, the, sensitivity, to, these, shortages, could, be, particularly, acute, affecting, agrarian, populations, to, an, extent, that, otherwise, may, not, have, been, routinely, experienced, by, prior, hunter, gatherer, communities, nevertheless, agrarian, communities, generally, proved, successful, and, their, growth, and, the, expansion, of, territory, under, cultivation, continued, another, significant, change, undergone, by, many, of, these, newly, agrarian, communities, was, one, of, diet, pre, agrarian, diets, varied, by, region, season, available, local, plant, and, animal, resources, and, degree, of, pastoralism, and, hunting, post, agrarian, diet, was, restricted, to, a, limited, package, of, successfully, cultivated, cereal, grains, plants, and, to, a, variable, extent, domesticated, animals, and, animal, products, supplementation, of, diet, by, hunting, and, gathering, was, to, variable, degrees, precluded, by, the, increase, in, population, above, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, land, and, a, high, sedentary, local, population, concentration, in, some, cultures, there, would, have, been, a, significant, shift, toward, increased, starch, and, plant, protein, the, relative, nutritional, benefits, and, drawbacks, of, these, dietary, changes, and, their, overall, impact, on, early, societal, development, are, still, debated, in, addition, increased, population, density, decreased, population, mobility, increased, continuous, proximity, to, domesticated, animals, and, continuous, occupation, of, comparatively, population, dense, sites, would, have, altered, sanitation, needs, and, patterns, of, disease, the, identifying, characteristic, of, neolithic, technology, is, the, use, of, polished, or, ground, stone, tools, in, contrast, to, the, flaked, stone, tools, used, during, the, paleolithic, era, neolithic, people, were, skilled, farmers, manufacturing, a, range, of, tools, necessary, for, the, tending, harvesting, and, processing, of, crops, such, as, sickle, blades, and, grinding, stones, and, food, production, e, g, pottery, bone, implements, they, were, also, skilled, manufacturers, of, a, range, of, other, types, of, stone, tools, and, ornaments, including, projectile, points, beads, and, statuettes, but, what, allowed, forest, clearance, on, a, large, scale, was, the, polished, stone, axe, above, all, other, tools, together, with, the, adze, fashioning, wood, for, shelter, structures, and, canoes, for, example, this, enabled, them, to, exploit, the, newly, developed, farmland, neolithic, peoples, in, the, levant, anatolia, syria, northern, mesopotamia, and, central, asia, were, also, accomplished, builders, utilizing, mud, brick, to, construct, houses, and, villages, at, atalh, y, k, houses, were, plastered, and, painted, with, elaborate, scenes, of, humans, and, animals, in, europe, long, houses, built, from, wattle, and, daub, were, constructed, elaborate, tombs, were, built, for, the, dead, these, tombs, are, particularly, numerous, in, ireland, where, there, are, many, thousand, still, in, existence, neolithic, people, in, the, british, isles, built, long, barrows, and, chamber, tombs, for, their, dead, and, causewayed, camps, henges, flint, mines, and, cursus, monuments, it, was, also, important, to, figure, out, ways, of, preserving, food, for, future, months, such, as, fashioning, relatively, airtight, containers, and, using, substances, like, salt, as, preservatives, the, peoples, of, the, americas, and, the, pacific, mostly, retained, the, neolithic, level, of, tool, technology, until, the, time, of, european, contact, exceptions, include, copper, hatchets, and, spearheads, in, the, great, lakes, region, most, clothing, appears, to, have, been, made, of, animal, skins, as, indicated, by, finds, of, large, numbers, of, bone, and, antler, pins, that, are, ideal, for, fastening, leather, wool, cloth, and, linen, might, have, become, available, during, the, later, neolithic, as, suggested, by, finds, of, perforated, stones, that, depending, on, size, may, have, served, as, spindle, whorls, or, loom, weights, paleolithic, epipalaeolithic, mesolithic,
