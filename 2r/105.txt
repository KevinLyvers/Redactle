caral, supe, also, known, as, caral, and, norte, chico, was, a, complex, pre, columbian, era, society, that, included, as, many, as, thirty, major, population, centers, in, what, is, now, the, caral, region, of, north, central, coastal, peru, the, civilization, flourished, between, the, fourth, and, second, millennia, bc, with, the, formation, of, the, first, city, generally, dated, to, around, 3500, bc, at, huaricanga, in, the, fortaleza, area, from, 3100, bc, onward, that, large, scale, human, settlement, and, communal, construction, become, clearly, apparent, which, lasted, until, a, period, of, decline, around, 1800, bc, since, the, early, 21st, century, it, has, been, recognized, as, the, oldest, known, civilization, in, the, americas, and, as, one, of, the, six, sites, where, civilization, separately, originated, in, the, ancient, world, this, civilization, flourished, along, three, rivers, the, fortaleza, the, pativilca, and, the, supe, these, river, valleys, each, have, large, clusters, of, sites, farther, south, there, are, several, associated, sites, along, the, huaura, river, the, alternative, name, caral, supe, is, derived, from, the, city, of, caral, in, the, supe, valley, a, large, and, well, studied, caral, supe, site, complex, society, in, the, caral, supe, arose, a, millennium, after, sumer, in, mesopotamia, was, contemporaneous, with, the, egyptian, pyramids, and, predated, the, mesoamerican, olmecs, by, nearly, two, millennia, in, archaeological, nomenclature, caral, supe, is, a, pre, ceramic, culture, of, the, pre, columbian, late, archaic, it, completely, lacked, ceramics, and, no, evidence, of, visual, art, has, survived, the, most, impressive, achievement, of, the, civilization, was, its, monumental, architecture, including, large, earthwork, platform, mounds, and, sunken, circular, plazas, archaeological, evidence, suggests, use, of, textile, technology, and, possibly, the, worship, of, common, deity, symbols, both, of, which, recur, in, pre, columbian, andean, cultures, sophisticated, government, is, presumed, to, have, been, required, to, manage, the, ancient, caral, questions, remain, over, its, organization, particularly, the, influence, of, food, resources, on, politics, archaeologists, have, been, aware, of, ancient, sites, in, the, area, since, at, least, the, 1940s, early, work, occurred, at, aspero, on, the, coast, a, site, identified, as, early, as, 1905, and, later, at, caral, farther, inland, in, the, late, 1990s, peruvian, archaeologists, led, by, ruth, shady, provided, the, first, extensive, documentation, of, the, civilization, with, work, at, caral, a, 2001, paper, in, science, providing, a, survey, of, the, caral, research, and, a, 2004, article, in, nature, describing, fieldwork, and, radiocarbon, dating, across, a, wider, area, revealed, caral, supe, s, full, significance, and, led, to, widespread, interest, the, dating, of, the, caral, supe, sites, has, pushed, back, the, estimated, beginning, date, of, complex, societies, in, the, peruvian, region, by, more, than, one, thousand, years, the, chav, n, culture, c, 900, bc, had, previously, been, considered, the, first, civilization, of, the, area, regularly, it, still, is, cited, incorrectly, as, such, in, general, works, the, discovery, of, caral, supe, has, also, shifted, the, focus, of, research, away, from, the, highland, areas, of, the, andes, and, lowlands, adjacent, to, the, mountains, where, the, chav, n, and, later, inca, had, their, major, centers, to, the, peruvian, littoral, or, coastal, regions, caral, is, located, in, a, north, central, area, of, the, coast, approximately, 150, to, 200, km, north, of, lima, roughly, bounded, by, the, lur, n, valley, on, the, south, and, the, casma, valley, on, the, north, it, comprises, four, coastal, valleys, the, huaura, supe, pativilca, and, fortaleza, known, sites, are, concentrated, in, the, latter, three, which, share, a, common, coastal, plain, the, three, principal, valleys, cover, only, 1, 800, km, and, research, has, emphasized, the, density, of, the, population, centers, the, peruvian, littoral, appears, an, improbable, even, aberrant, candidate, for, the, pristine, development, of, civilization, compared, to, other, world, centers, it, is, extremely, arid, bounded, by, two, rain, shadows, caused, by, the, andes, to, the, east, and, the, pacific, trade, winds, to, the, west, the, region, is, punctuated, by, more, than, 50, rivers, that, carry, andean, snowmelt, the, development, of, widespread, irrigation, from, these, water, sources, is, seen, as, decisive, in, the, emergence, of, caral, supe, since, all, of, the, monumental, architecture, at, various, sites, has, been, found, close, to, irrigation, channels, the, radiocarbon, work, of, jonathan, haas, et, al, found, that, 10, of, 95, samples, taken, in, the, pativilca, and, fortaleza, areas, dated, from, before, 3500, bc, the, oldest, dating, from, 9210, bc, provides, limited, indication, of, human, settlement, during, the, pre, columbian, early, archaic, era, two, dates, of, 3700, bc, are, associated, with, communal, architecture, but, are, likely, to, be, anomalous, it, is, from, 3200, bc, onward, that, large, scale, human, settlement, and, communal, construction, are, clearly, apparent, mann, in, a, survey, of, the, literature, in, 2005, suggests, sometime, before, 3200, bc, and, possibly, before, 3500, bc, as, the, beginning, date, of, the, caral, supe, formative, period, he, notes, that, the, earliest, date, securely, associated, with, a, city, is, 3500, bc, at, huaricanga, in, the, fortaleza, area, of, the, north, based, on, haas, s, dates, haas, s, early, third, millennium, dates, suggest, that, the, development, of, coastal, and, inland, sites, occurred, in, parallel, but, from, 2500, to, 2000, bc, during, the, period, of, greatest, expansion, the, population, and, development, decisively, shifted, toward, the, inland, sites, all, development, apparently, occurred, at, large, interior, sites, such, as, caral, although, they, remained, dependent, on, fish, and, shellfish, from, the, coast, the, peak, in, dates, is, in, keeping, with, shady, s, dates, at, caral, which, show, habitation, from, 2627, bc, to, 2020, bc, that, coastal, and, inland, sites, developed, in, tandem, remains, disputed, however, see, next, section, by, around, 2200, bc, the, influence, of, norte, chico, civilization, spread, far, along, the, coast, to, the, south, it, went, as, far, as, the, chillon, valley, and, the, site, of, el, paraiso, to, the, north, it, spread, as, far, as, the, santa, river, valley, c, 1800, bc, the, caral, supe, civilization, began, to, decline, with, more, powerful, centers, appearing, to, the, south, and, north, along, the, coast, and, to, the, east, inside, the, belt, of, the, andes, the, success, of, irrigation, based, agriculture, at, caral, supe, may, have, contributed, to, its, being, eclipsed, anthropologist, professor, winifred, creamer, of, northern, illinois, university, notes, that, when, this, civilization, is, in, decline, we, begin, to, find, extensive, canals, farther, north, people, were, moving, to, more, fertile, ground, and, taking, their, knowledge, of, irrigation, with, them, it, would, be, a, thousand, years, before, the, rise, of, the, next, great, peruvian, culture, the, chav, n, cultural, links, with, the, highland, areas, have, been, noted, by, archaeologists, ruth, shady, highlights, the, links, with, the, kotosh, religious, tradition, numerous, architectural, features, found, among, the, settlements, of, supe, including, subterranean, circular, courts, stepped, pyramids, and, sequential, platforms, as, well, as, material, remains, and, their, cultural, implications, excavated, at, aspero, and, the, valley, sites, we, are, digging, caral, chupacigarro, lurihuasi, miraya, are, shared, with, other, settlements, of, the, area, that, participated, in, what, is, known, as, the, kotosh, religious, tradition, most, specific, among, these, features, include, rooms, with, benches, and, hearths, with, subterranean, ventilation, ducts, wall, niches, biconvex, beads, and, musical, flutes, research, into, caral, supe, continues, with, many, unsettled, questions, debate, is, ongoing, regarding, two, related, questions, the, degree, to, which, the, flourishing, of, the, caral, supe, was, based, on, maritime, food, resources, and, the, exact, relationship, this, implies, between, the, coastal, and, inland, sites, a, broad, outline, of, the, caral, supe, diet, has, been, suggested, at, caral, the, edible, domesticated, plants, noted, by, shady, are, squash, beans, l, cuma, guava, pacay, inga, feuilleei, and, sweet, potato, haas, et, al, noted, the, same, foods, in, their, survey, farther, north, while, adding, avocado, and, achira, in, 2013, evidence, for, maize, also, was, documented, by, haas, et, al, see, below, there, was, also, a, significant, seafood, component, at, both, coastal, and, inland, sites, shady, notes, that, animal, remains, are, almost, exclusively, marine, at, caral, including, clams, and, mussels, and, large, amounts, of, anchovies, and, sardines, that, the, anchovy, fish, reached, inland, is, clear, although, haas, suggests, that, shellfish, sea, mammals, and, seaweed, do, not, appear, to, have, been, significant, portions, of, the, diet, in, the, inland, non, maritime, sites, the, role, of, seafood, in, the, caral, supe, diet, has, aroused, debate, much, early, fieldwork, was, conducted, in, the, region, of, aspero, on, the, coast, before, the, full, scope, and, inter, connectedness, of, the, several, sites, of, the, civilization, were, realized, in, a, 1973, paper, michael, e, moseley, contended, that, a, maritime, subsistence, seafood, economy, had, been, the, basis, of, the, society, and, its, remarkably, early, flourishing, a, theory, later, elaborated, as, a, maritime, foundation, of, andean, civilization, mfac, he, confirmed, a, previously, observed, lack, of, ceramics, at, aspero, and, he, deduced, that, hummocks, on, the, site, constituted, the, remains, of, artificial, platform, mounds, this, thesis, of, a, maritime, foundation, was, contrary, to, the, general, scholarly, consensus, that, the, rise, of, civilization, was, based, on, intensive, agriculture, particularly, of, at, least, one, cereal, the, production, of, agricultural, surpluses, had, long, been, seen, as, essential, in, promoting, population, density, and, the, emergence, of, complex, society, moseley, s, ideas, would, be, debated, and, challenged, that, maritime, remains, and, their, caloric, contribution, were, overestimated, for, example, but, have, been, treated, as, plausible, as, late, as, 2005, when, mann, conducted, a, summary, of, the, literature, concomitant, to, the, maritime, subsistence, hypothesis, was, an, implied, dominance, of, sites, immediately, adjacent, to, the, coast, over, other, centers, this, idea, was, shaken, by, the, realization, of, the, magnitude, of, caral, an, inland, site, supplemental, to, a, 1997, article, by, shady, dating, caral, a, 2001, science, news, article, emphasized, the, dominance, of, agriculture, and, also, suggested, that, caral, was, the, oldest, urban, center, in, peru, and, the, entire, americas, it, rejected, the, idea, that, civilization, might, have, begun, adjacent, to, the, coast, and, then, moved, inland, one, archaeologist, was, quoted, as, suggesting, that, rather, than, coastal, antecedents, to, monumental, inland, sites, what, we, have, now, are, coastal, satellite, villages, to, monumental, inland, sites, these, assertions, were, quickly, challenged, by, sandweiss, and, moseley, who, observed, that, caral, although, being, the, largest, and, most, complex, preceramic, site, it, is, not, the, oldest, they, admitted, the, importance, of, agriculture, to, industry, and, to, augment, diet, while, broadly, affirming, the, formative, role, of, marine, resources, in, early, andean, civilization, scholars, now, agree, that, the, inland, sites, did, have, significantly, greater, populations, and, that, there, were, so, many, more, people, along, the, four, rivers, than, on, the, shore, that, they, had, to, have, been, dominant, the, remaining, question, is, which, of, the, areas, developed, first, and, created, a, template, for, subsequent, development, haas, rejects, suggestions, that, maritime, development, at, sites, immediately, adjacent, to, the, coast, was, initial, pointing, to, contemporaneous, development, based, on, his, dating, moseley, remains, convinced, that, coastal, aspero, is, the, oldest, site, and, that, its, maritime, subsistence, served, as, a, basis, for, the, civilization, the, use, of, cotton, of, the, species, gossypium, barbadense, played, an, important, economic, role, in, the, relationship, between, the, inland, and, the, coastal, settlements, in, this, area, of, peru, nevertheless, scholars, are, still, divided, over, the, exact, chronology, of, these, developments, although, not, edible, cotton, was, the, most, important, product, of, irrigation, in, the, caral, supe, culture, vital, to, the, production, of, fishing, nets, that, in, turn, provided, maritime, resources, as, well, as, to, textiles, and, textile, technology, haas, notes, that, control, over, cotton, allows, a, ruling, elite, to, provide, the, benefit, of, cloth, for, clothing, bags, wraps, and, adornment, he, is, willing, to, admit, to, a, mutual, dependency, dilemma, the, prehistoric, residents, of, the, norte, chico, needed, the, fish, resources, for, their, protein, and, the, fishermen, needed, the, cotton, to, make, the, nets, to, catch, the, fish, thus, identifying, cotton, as, a, vital, resource, produced, in, the, inland, does, not, by, itself, resolve, the, issue, of, whether, the, inland, centers, were, a, progenitor, for, those, on, the, coast, or, vice, versa, moseley, argues, that, successful, maritime, centers, would, have, moved, inland, to, find, cotton, in, a, 2018, publication, david, g, beresford, jones, with, coauthors, have, defended, moseley, s, 1975, maritime, foundations, of, andean, civilization, mfac, hypothesis, the, authors, modified, and, refined, the, maritime, foundations, of, andean, civilization, hypothesis, of, moseley, thus, according, to, them, the, mfac, hypothesis, now, emerges, more, persuasive, than, ever, it, was, the, potential, for, increased, quantities, of, food, production, that, the, cultivation, of, cotton, allowed, that, was, the, key, in, precipitating, revolutionary, social, change, and, social, complexity, according, to, the, authors, previous, to, that, the, gathering, of, bast, fibers, of, wild, asclepias, was, used, for, fiber, production, which, was, far, less, efficient, beresford, jones, and, others, also, offered, further, support, for, their, theories, in, 2021, it, was, swiss, archaeologist, fr, d, ric, engel, originally, who, coined, the, term, cotton, preceramic, stage, in, 1957, to, describe, the, unusual, coastal, sites, such, norte, chico, that, had, cotton, but, lacked, ceramics, and, were, very, ancient, this, stage, was, seen, as, running, for, about, 1200, years, from, 3000, to, 1800, bc, the, development, of, caral, supe, is, particularly, remarkable, for, the, apparent, absence, of, an, agricultural, staple, food, however, recent, studies, increasingly, dispute, this, and, point, to, maize, as, a, dietary, backbone, of, this, and, later, pre, columbian, civilizations, moseley, found, a, small, number, of, maize, cobs, in, 1973, at, aspero, also, seen, in, site, work, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, but, has, since, called, the, find, problematic, however, increasing, evidence, has, emerged, about, the, importance, of, maize, in, this, period, archaeological, testing, at, a, number, of, sites, in, the, norte, chico, region, of, the, north, central, coast, provides, a, broad, range, of, empirical, data, on, the, production, processing, and, consumption, of, maize, new, data, drawn, from, coprolites, pollen, records, and, stone, tool, residues, combined, with, 126, radiocarbon, dates, demonstrate, that, maize, was, widely, grown, intensively, processed, and, constituted, a, primary, component, of, the, diet, throughout, the, period, from, 3000, to, 1800, bc, for, beresford, jones, his, new, research, on, the, two, nearby, ancient, coastal, settlements, of, la, yerba, on, the, east, bank, of, ica, river, peru, r, o, ica, was, very, important, this, is, not, far, from, the, southern, peruvian, town, of, ica, the, earlier, of, these, settlement, was, la, yerba, ii, 7571, 6674, cal, bp, or, ca, 5570, 4670, bc, when, it, was, occupied, la, yerba, ii, shell, midden, was, situated, rather, close, to, the, ancient, surf, line, this, was, not, a, permanently, occupied, site, a, somewhat, later, site, la, yerba, iii, on, the, other, hand, was, a, permanently, occupied, settlement, and, shows, a, population, that, was, an, order, of, magnitude, greater, than, earlier, obsidian, debitage, was, abundant, at, la, yerba, iii, as, opposed, to, earlier, this, suggests, an, increasing, interaction, extending, to, the, highlands, where, obsidian, was, procured, the, population, of, la, yerba, iii, already, practiced, some, floodplain, horticulture, they, cultivated, gourds, phaseolus, and, canavalia, beans, and, plant, fiber, production, was, of, great, importance, for, their, fishing, economy, therefore, they, were, pre, adapted, to, a, cotton, revolution, the, degree, of, centralized, authority, is, difficult, to, ascertain, but, architectural, construction, patterns, are, indicative, at, least, in, certain, places, at, certain, times, of, an, elite, population, who, wielded, considerable, power, while, some, of, the, monumental, architecture, was, constructed, incrementally, other, buildings, such, as, the, two, main, platform, mounds, at, caral, appear, to, have, been, constructed, in, one, or, two, intense, construction, phases, as, further, evidence, of, centralized, control, haas, points, to, remains, of, large, stone, warehouses, found, at, upaca, on, the, pativilca, as, emblematic, of, authorities, able, to, control, vital, resources, such, as, cotton, haas, suggests, that, the, labour, mobilization, patterns, revealed, by, the, archaeological, evidence, point, to, a, unique, emergence, of, human, government, one, of, two, alongside, sumer, or, three, if, mesoamerica, is, included, as, a, separate, case, while, in, other, cases, the, idea, of, government, would, have, been, borrowed, or, copied, in, this, small, group, government, was, invented, other, archaeologists, have, rejected, such, claims, as, hyperbolic, in, exploring, the, basis, of, possible, government, haas, suggests, three, broad, bases, of, power, for, early, complex, societies, he, finds, the, first, two, present, in, ancient, caral, supe, economic, authority, would, have, rested, on, the, control, of, cotton, edible, plants, and, associated, trade, relationships, with, power, centered, on, the, inland, sites, haas, tentatively, suggests, that, the, scope, of, this, economic, power, base, may, have, extended, widely, there, are, only, two, confirmed, shore, sites, in, the, caral, supe, aspero, and, bandurria, and, possibly, two, more, but, cotton, fishing, nets, and, domesticated, plants, have, been, found, up, and, down, the, peruvian, coast, it, is, possible, that, the, major, inland, centers, of, caral, supe, were, at, the, center, of, a, broad, regional, trade, network, centered, on, these, resources, citing, shady, a, 2005, article, in, discover, magazine, suggests, a, rich, and, varied, trade, life, exported, its, own, products, and, those, of, aspero, to, distant, communities, in, exchange, for, exotic, imports, spondylus, shells, from, the, coast, of, ecuador, rich, dyes, from, the, andean, highlands, hallucinogenic, snuff, from, the, amazon, given, the, still, limited, extent, of, caral, supe, research, such, claims, should, be, treated, circumspectly, other, reports, on, shady, s, work, indicate, caral, traded, with, communities, in, the, jungle, farther, inland, and, possibly, with, people, from, the, mountains, haas, postulates, that, ideological, power, exercised, by, leadership, was, based, on, apparent, access, to, deities, and, the, supernatural, evidence, regarding, caral, supe, religion, is, limited, in, 2003, an, image, of, the, staff, god, a, leering, figure, with, a, hood, and, fangs, was, found, on, a, gourd, that, dated, to, 2250, bc, the, staff, god, is, a, major, deity, of, later, andean, cultures, and, winifred, creamer, suggests, the, find, points, to, worship, of, common, symbols, of, deities, as, with, much, other, research, at, caral, supe, the, nature, and, significance, of, the, find, has, been, disputed, by, other, researchers, mann, postulates, that, the, act, of, architectural, construction, and, maintenance, at, caral, supe, may, have, been, a, spiritual, or, religious, experience, a, process, of, communal, exaltation, and, ceremony, shady, has, called, caral, the, sacred, city, la, ciudad, sagrada, and, reports, that, socio, economic, and, political, focus, was, on, the, temples, which, were, periodically, remodeled, with, major, burnt, offerings, associated, with, the, remodeling, haas, notes, the, absence, of, any, suggestion, of, physical, bases, of, power, that, is, defensive, construction, at, caral, supe, there, is, no, evidence, of, warfare, of, any, kind, or, at, any, level, during, the, preceramic, period, mutilated, bodies, burned, buildings, and, other, tell, tale, signs, of, violence, are, absent, and, settlement, patterns, are, completely, non, defensive, the, evidence, of, the, development, of, complex, government, in, the, absence, of, warfare, contrasts, markedly, to, archaeological, theory, which, suggests, that, human, beings, move, away, from, kin, based, groups, to, larger, units, resembling, states, for, mutual, defense, of, often, scarce, resources, in, caral, supe, a, vital, resource, was, present, arable, land, generally, and, the, cotton, crop, specifically, but, mann, noted, that, apparently, the, move, to, greater, complexity, by, the, culture, was, not, driven, by, the, need, for, defense, or, warfare, caral, supe, sites, are, known, for, their, density, of, large, sites, with, immense, architecture, haas, argues, that, the, density, of, sites, in, such, a, small, area, is, globally, unique, for, a, nascent, civilization, during, the, third, millennium, bc, caral, supe, may, have, been, the, most, densely, populated, area, of, the, world, excepting, possibly, northern, china, the, supe, pativilca, fortaleza, and, huaura, river, valleys, of, caral, supe, each, have, several, related, sites, evidence, from, the, ground, breaking, work, during, 1973, at, aspero, at, the, mouth, of, the, supe, valley, suggested, a, site, of, approximately, 13, hectares, 32, acres, surveying, of, the, midden, suggested, extensive, prehistoric, construction, activity, small, scale, terracing, was, noted, along, with, more, sophisticated, platform, mound, masonry, as, many, as, eleven, artificial, mounds, were, estimated, to, exist, at, the, site, moseley, calls, these, corporate, labor, platforms, given, that, their, size, layout, and, construction, materials, and, techniques, would, have, required, an, organized, workforce, the, survey, of, the, northern, rivers, found, sites, between, 10, and, 100, ha, 25, and, 247, acres, between, one, and, seven, large, platform, mounds, rectangular, terraced, pyramids, were, discovered, ranging, in, size, from, 3, 000, m, 3, 110, 000, cu, ft, to, more, than, 100, 000, m, 3, 3, 500, 000, cu, ft, shady, notes, that, the, central, zone, of, caral, with, monumental, architecture, covers, an, area, of, just, greater, than, 65, hectares, 160, acres, also, six, platform, mounds, numerous, smaller, mounds, two, sunken, circular, plazas, and, a, variety, of, residential, architecture, were, discovered, at, this, site, the, monumental, architecture, was, constructed, with, quarried, stone, and, river, cobbles, using, reed, shicra, bags, some, of, which, have, been, preserved, laborers, would, have, hauled, the, material, to, sites, by, hand, roger, atwood, of, archaeology, magazine, describes, the, process, armies, of, workers, would, gather, a, long, durable, grass, known, as, shicra, in, the, highlands, above, the, city, tie, the, grass, strands, into, loosely, meshed, bags, fill, the, bags, with, boulders, and, then, pack, the, trenches, behind, each, successive, retaining, wall, of, the, step, pyramids, with, the, stone, filled, bags, in, this, way, the, people, of, norte, chico, achieved, formidable, architectural, success, the, largest, of, the, platforms, mounds, at, caral, the, piramide, mayor, measures, 160, by, 150, m, 520, by, 490, ft, and, rises, 18, m, 59, ft, high, in, its, summation, of, the, 2001, shady, paper, the, bbc, suggests, workers, would, have, been, paid, or, compelled, to, work, on, centralized, projects, of, this, sort, with, dried, anchovies, possibly, serving, as, a, form, of, currency, mann, points, to, ideology, charisma, and, skilfully, timed, reinforcement, from, leaders, when, compared, to, the, common, eurasian, models, of, the, development, of, civilization, caral, supe, s, differences, are, striking, in, caral, supe, a, total, lack, of, ceramics, persists, across, the, period, crops, were,
