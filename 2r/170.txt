the, seleucid, empire, s, lj, u, s, d, was, a, greek, power, in, west, asia, during, the, hellenistic, period, it, was, founded, in, 312, bc, by, the, macedonian, general, seleucus, i, nicator, following, the, division, of, the, macedonian, empire, founded, by, alexander, the, great, and, ruled, by, the, seleucid, dynasty, until, its, annexation, by, the, roman, republic, under, pompey, in, 63, bc, after, receiving, the, mesopotamian, regions, of, babylonia, and, assyria, in, 321, bc, seleucus, i, began, expanding, his, dominions, to, include, the, near, eastern, territories, that, encompass, modern, day, iraq, iran, afghanistan, syria, and, lebanon, all, of, which, had, been, under, macedonian, control, after, the, fall, of, the, former, persian, achaemenid, empire, at, the, seleucid, empire, s, height, it, had, consisted, of, territory, that, covered, anatolia, persia, the, levant, mesopotamia, and, what, are, now, modern, kuwait, afghanistan, and, parts, of, turkmenistan, the, seleucid, empire, was, a, major, center, of, hellenistic, culture, greek, customs, and, language, were, privileged, the, wide, variety, of, local, traditions, had, been, generally, tolerated, while, an, urban, greek, elite, had, formed, the, dominant, political, class, and, was, reinforced, by, steady, immigration, from, greece, the, empire, s, western, territories, were, repeatedly, contested, with, ptolemaic, egypt, a, rival, hellenistic, state, to, the, east, conflict, with, the, indian, ruler, chandragupta, of, the, maurya, empire, in, 305, bc, led, to, the, cession, of, vast, territory, west, of, the, indus, and, a, political, alliance, in, the, early, second, century, bc, antiochus, iii, the, great, attempted, to, project, seleucid, power, and, authority, into, hellenistic, greece, but, his, attempts, were, thwarted, by, the, roman, republic, and, its, greek, allies, the, seleucids, were, forced, to, pay, costly, war, reparations, and, had, to, relinquish, territorial, claims, west, of, the, taurus, mountains, in, southern, anatolia, marking, the, gradual, decline, of, their, empire, mithridates, i, of, parthia, conquered, much, of, the, remaining, eastern, lands, of, the, seleucid, empire, in, the, mid, second, century, bc, including, assyria, and, what, had, been, babylonia, while, the, independent, greco, bactrian, kingdom, continued, to, flourish, in, the, northeast, the, seleucid, kings, were, thereafter, reduced, to, a, rump, state, in, syria, until, their, conquest, by, tigranes, the, great, of, armenia, in, 83, bc, and, ultimate, overthrow, by, the, roman, general, pompey, in, 63, bc, contemporary, sources, such, as, a, loyalist, decree, honoring, antiochus, i, from, ilium, in, greek, language, define, the, seleucid, state, both, as, an, empire, arche, and, as, a, kingdom, basileia, similarly, seleucid, rulers, were, described, as, kings, in, babylonia, starting, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, ancient, writers, referred, to, the, seleucid, ruler, as, the, king, of, syria, lord, of, asia, and, other, designations, the, evidence, for, the, seleucid, rulers, representing, themselves, as, kings, of, syria, is, provided, by, the, inscription, of, antigonus, son, of, menophilus, who, described, himself, as, the, admiral, of, alexander, king, of, syria, he, refers, to, either, alexander, balas, or, alexander, ii, zabinas, as, a, ruler, alexander, who, quickly, conquered, the, persian, empire, under, its, last, achaemenid, dynast, darius, iii, died, young, in, 323, bc, leaving, an, expansive, empire, of, partly, hellenised, culture, without, an, adult, heir, the, empire, was, put, under, the, authority, of, a, regent, perdiccas, and, the, vast, territories, were, divided, among, alexander, s, generals, who, thereby, became, satraps, at, the, partition, of, babylon, all, in, that, same, year, alexander, s, generals, known, as, diadochi, jostled, for, supremacy, over, parts, of, his, empire, following, his, death, ptolemy, i, soter, a, former, general, and, then, current, satrap, of, egypt, was, the, first, to, challenge, the, new, system, which, eventually, led, to, the, demise, of, perdiccas, ptolemy, s, revolt, created, a, new, subdivision, of, the, empire, with, the, partition, of, triparadisus, in, 320, bc, seleucus, who, had, been, commander, in, chief, of, the, companion, cavalry, hetairoi, and, appointed, first, or, court, chiliarch, which, made, him, the, senior, officer, in, the, royal, army, after, the, regent, and, commander, in, chief, perdiccas, since, 323, bc, though, he, helped, to, assassinate, him, later, received, babylonia, and, from, that, point, continued, to, expand, his, dominions, ruthlessly, seleucus, established, himself, in, babylon, in, 312, bc, the, year, later, used, as, the, foundation, date, of, the, seleucid, empire, the, rise, of, seleucus, in, babylon, threatened, the, eastern, extent, of, the, territory, of, antigonus, i, monophthalmus, in, asia, antigonus, along, with, his, son, demetrius, i, poliorcetes, unsuccessfully, led, a, campaign, to, annex, babylon, the, victory, of, seleucus, ensured, his, claim, of, babylon, and, legitimacy, he, ruled, not, only, babylonia, but, the, entire, enormous, eastern, part, of, alexander, s, empire, as, described, by, the, historian, appian, always, lying, in, wait, for, the, neighboring, nations, strong, in, arms, and, persuasive, in, council, he, acquired, mesopotamia, armenia, seleucid, cappadocia, persis, parthia, bactria, arabia, tapouria, sogdia, arachosia, hyrcania, and, other, adjacent, peoples, that, had, been, subdued, by, alexander, as, far, as, the, river, indus, so, that, the, boundaries, of, his, empire, were, the, most, extensive, in, asia, after, that, of, alexander, the, whole, region, from, phrygia, to, the, indus, was, subject, to, seleucus, chandragupta, maurya, sandrokottos, founded, the, maurya, empire, in, 321, bc, after, the, conquest, of, the, nanda, empire, and, their, capital, pataliputra, in, magadha, chandragupta, then, redirected, his, attention, to, the, indus, river, region, and, by, 317, bc, he, conquered, the, remaining, greek, satraps, left, by, alexander, expecting, a, confrontation, seleucus, gathered, his, army, and, marched, to, the, indus, it, is, said, that, chandragupta, could, have, fielded, a, conscript, army, of, 600, 000, men, and, 9, 000, war, elephants, mainstream, scholarship, asserts, that, chandragupta, received, formalized, through, a, treaty, vast, territory, west, of, the, indus, including, the, hindu, kush, modern, day, afghanistan, and, the, balochistan, province, of, pakistan, archaeologically, concrete, indications, of, mauryan, rule, such, as, the, inscriptions, of, the, edicts, of, ashoka, are, known, as, far, as, kandahar, in, southern, afghanistan, according, to, appian, he, crossed, the, indus, and, waged, war, with, sandrocottus, king, of, the, indians, who, dwelt, on, the, banks, of, that, stream, until, they, came, to, an, understanding, with, each, other, and, contracted, a, marriage, relationship, it, is, generally, thought, that, chandragupta, married, seleucus, s, daughter, or, a, macedonian, princess, a, gift, from, seleucus, to, formalize, an, alliance, in, a, return, gesture, chandragupta, sent, 500, war, elephants, a, military, asset, which, would, play, a, decisive, role, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, in, 301, bc, in, addition, to, this, treaty, seleucus, dispatched, an, ambassador, megasthenes, to, chandragupta, and, later, deimakos, to, his, son, bindusara, at, the, mauryan, court, at, pataliputra, modern, patna, in, bihar, state, megasthenes, wrote, detailed, descriptions, of, india, and, chandragupta, s, reign, which, have, been, partly, preserved, to, us, through, diodorus, siculus, later, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, the, ruler, of, ptolemaic, egypt, and, contemporary, of, ashoka, the, great, is, also, recorded, by, pliny, the, elder, as, having, sent, an, ambassador, named, dionysius, to, the, mauryan, court, the, indians, occupy, some, of, the, countries, situated, along, the, indus, which, formerly, belonged, to, the, persians, alexander, deprived, the, ariani, of, them, and, established, there, settlements, of, his, own, but, seleucus, nicator, gave, them, to, sandrocottus, chandragupta, maurya, in, consequence, of, a, marriage, contract, and, received, in, return, five, hundred, elephants, other, territories, ceded, before, seleucus, death, were, gedrosia, in, the, south, east, of, the, iranian, plateau, and, to, the, north, of, this, arachosia, on, the, west, bank, of, the, indus, river, following, his, and, lysimachus, decisive, victory, over, antigonus, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, in, 301, bc, seleucus, took, control, over, eastern, anatolia, and, northern, syria, in, the, latter, area, he, founded, a, new, capital, at, antioch, on, the, orontes, a, city, he, named, after, his, father, an, alternative, capital, was, established, at, seleucia, on, the, tigris, north, of, babylon, seleucus, s, empire, reached, its, greatest, extent, following, his, defeat, of, his, erstwhile, ally, lysimachus, at, corupedion, in, 281, bc, after, which, seleucus, expanded, his, control, to, encompass, western, anatolia, he, hoped, further, to, take, control, of, lysimachus, s, lands, in, europe, primarily, thrace, and, even, macedonia, itself, but, was, assassinated, by, ptolemy, ceraunus, on, landing, in, europe, his, son, and, successor, antiochus, i, soter, was, left, with, an, enormous, realm, consisting, of, nearly, all, of, the, asian, portions, of, the, empire, but, faced, with, antigonus, ii, gonatas, in, macedonia, and, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, in, egypt, he, proved, unable, to, pick, up, where, his, father, had, left, off, in, conquering, the, european, portions, of, alexander, s, empire, antiochus, i, reigned, 281, 261, bc, and, his, son, and, successor, antiochus, ii, theos, reigned, 261, 246, bc, were, faced, with, challenges, in, the, west, including, repeated, wars, with, ptolemy, ii, and, a, celtic, invasion, of, asia, minor, distracting, attention, from, holding, the, eastern, portions, of, the, empire, together, towards, the, end, of, antiochus, ii, s, reign, various, provinces, simultaneously, asserted, their, independence, such, as, bactria, and, sogdiana, under, diodotus, cappadocia, under, ariarathes, iii, and, parthia, under, andragoras, a, few, years, later, the, last, was, defeated, and, killed, by, the, invading, parni, of, arsaces, the, region, would, then, become, the, core, of, the, parthian, empire, diodotus, governor, for, the, bactrian, territory, asserted, independence, in, around, 245, bc, although, the, exact, date, is, far, from, certain, to, form, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, this, kingdom, was, characterized, by, a, rich, hellenistic, culture, and, was, to, continue, its, domination, of, bactria, until, around, 125, bc, when, it, was, overrun, by, the, invasion, of, northern, nomads, one, of, the, greco, bactrian, kings, demetrius, i, of, bactria, invaded, india, around, 180, bc, to, form, the, indo, greek, kingdoms, the, rulers, of, persis, called, fratarakas, also, seem, to, have, established, some, level, of, independence, from, the, seleucids, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, especially, from, the, time, of, vahbarz, they, would, later, overtly, take, the, title, of, kings, of, persis, before, becoming, vassals, to, the, newly, formed, parthian, empire, the, seleucid, satrap, of, parthia, named, andragoras, first, claimed, independence, in, a, parallel, to, the, secession, of, his, bactrian, neighbour, soon, after, however, a, parthian, tribal, chief, called, arsaces, invaded, the, parthian, territory, around, 238, bc, to, form, the, arsacid, dynasty, from, which, the, parthian, empire, originated, antiochus, ii, s, son, seleucus, ii, callinicus, came, to, the, throne, around, 246, bc, seleucus, ii, was, soon, dramatically, defeated, in, the, third, syrian, war, against, ptolemy, iii, of, egypt, and, then, had, to, fight, a, civil, war, against, his, own, brother, antiochus, hierax, taking, advantage, of, this, distraction, bactria, and, parthia, seceded, from, the, empire, in, asia, minor, too, the, seleucid, dynasty, seemed, to, be, losing, control, the, gauls, had, fully, established, themselves, in, galatia, semi, independent, semi, hellenized, kingdoms, had, sprung, up, in, bithynia, pontus, and, cappadocia, and, the, city, of, pergamum, in, the, west, was, asserting, its, independence, under, the, attalid, dynasty, the, seleucid, economy, started, to, show, the, first, signs, of, weakness, as, galatians, gained, independence, and, pergamum, took, control, of, coastal, cities, in, anatolia, consequently, they, managed, to, partially, block, contact, with, the, west, a, revival, would, begin, when, seleucus, ii, s, younger, son, antiochus, iii, the, great, took, the, throne, in, 223, bc, although, initially, unsuccessful, in, the, fourth, syrian, war, against, egypt, which, led, to, a, defeat, at, the, battle, of, raphia, 217, bc, antiochus, would, prove, himself, to, be, the, greatest, of, the, seleucid, rulers, after, seleucus, i, himself, he, spent, the, next, ten, years, on, his, anabasis, journey, through, the, eastern, parts, of, his, domain, and, restoring, rebellious, vassals, like, parthia, and, greco, bactria, to, at, least, nominal, obedience, he, gained, many, victories, such, as, the, battle, of, mount, labus, and, battle, of, the, arius, and, besieged, the, bactrian, capital, he, even, emulated, seleucus, with, an, expedition, into, india, where, he, met, with, king, sophagasenus, sanskrit, subhagasena, receiving, war, elephants, perhaps, in, accordance, of, the, existing, treaty, and, alliance, set, after, the, seleucid, mauryan, war, actual, translation, of, polybius, 11, 34, no, other, source, except, polybius, makes, any, reference, to, sophagasenus, he, crossed, the, caucasus, indicus, paropamisus, hindu, kush, and, descended, into, india, renewed, his, friendship, with, sophagasenus, the, king, of, the, indians, received, more, elephants, until, he, had, a, hundred, and, fifty, altogether, and, having, once, more, provisioned, his, troops, set, out, again, personally, with, his, army, leaving, androsthenes, of, cyzicus, the, duty, of, taking, home, the, treasure, which, this, king, had, agreed, to, hand, over, to, him, having, traversed, arachosia, and, crossed, the, river, enymanthus, he, came, through, drangene, to, carmania, and, as, it, was, now, winter, he, put, his, men, into, winter, quarters, there, when, he, returned, to, the, west, in, 205, bc, antiochus, found, that, with, the, death, of, ptolemy, iv, the, situation, now, looked, propitious, for, another, western, campaign, antiochus, and, philip, v, of, macedon, then, made, a, pact, to, divide, the, ptolemaic, possessions, outside, of, egypt, and, in, the, fifth, syrian, war, the, seleucids, ousted, ptolemy, v, from, control, of, coele, syria, the, battle, of, panium, 200, bc, definitively, transferred, these, holdings, from, the, ptolemies, to, the, seleucids, antiochus, appeared, at, the, least, to, have, restored, the, seleucid, kingdom, to, glory, following, the, defeat, of, his, erstwhile, ally, philip, by, rome, in, 197, bc, antiochus, saw, the, opportunity, for, expansion, into, greece, itself, encouraged, by, the, exiled, carthaginian, general, hannibal, and, making, an, alliance, with, the, disgruntled, aetolian, league, antiochus, launched, an, invasion, across, the, hellespont, with, his, huge, army, he, aimed, to, establish, the, seleucid, empire, as, the, foremost, power, in, the, hellenic, world, but, these, plans, put, the, empire, on, a, collision, course, with, the, new, rising, power, of, the, mediterranean, the, roman, republic, at, the, battles, of, thermopylae, 191, bc, and, magnesia, 190, bc, antiochus, s, forces, suffered, resounding, defeats, and, he, was, compelled, to, make, peace, and, sign, the, treaty, of, apamea, 188, bc, the, main, clause, of, which, saw, the, seleucids, agree, to, pay, a, large, indemnity, to, retreat, from, anatolia, and, to, never, again, attempt, to, expand, seleucid, territory, west, of, the, taurus, mountains, the, kingdom, of, pergamum, and, the, republic, of, rhodes, rome, s, allies, in, the, war, gained, the, former, seleucid, lands, in, anatolia, antiochus, died, in, 187, bc, on, another, expedition, to, the, east, where, he, sought, to, extract, money, to, pay, the, indemnity, the, reign, of, his, son, and, successor, seleucus, iv, philopator, 187, 175, bc, was, largely, spent, in, attempts, to, pay, the, large, indemnity, and, seleucus, was, ultimately, assassinated, by, his, minister, heliodorus, seleucus, younger, brother, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, now, seized, the, throne, he, attempted, to, restore, seleucid, power, and, prestige, with, a, successful, war, against, the, old, enemy, ptolemaic, egypt, which, met, with, initial, success, as, the, seleucids, defeated, and, drove, the, egyptian, army, back, to, alexandria, itself, as, the, king, planned, on, how, to, conclude, the, war, he, was, informed, that, roman, commissioners, led, by, the, proconsul, gaius, popillius, laenas, were, near, and, requesting, a, meeting, with, the, seleucid, king, antiochus, agreed, but, when, they, met, and, antiochus, held, out, his, hand, in, friendship, popilius, placed, in, his, hand, the, tablets, on, which, was, written, the, decree, of, the, senate, and, told, him, to, read, it, the, decree, demanded, that, he, should, abort, his, attack, on, alexandria, and, immediately, stop, waging, the, war, on, ptolemy, when, the, king, said, that, he, would, call, his, friends, into, council, and, consider, what, he, ought, to, do, popilius, drew, a, circle, in, the, sand, around, the, king, s, feet, with, the, stick, he, was, carrying, and, said, before, you, step, out, of, that, circle, give, me, a, reply, to, lay, before, the, senate, for, a, few, moments, he, hesitated, astounded, at, such, a, peremptory, order, and, at, last, replied, i, will, do, what, the, senate, thinks, right, he, then, chose, to, withdraw, rather, than, set, the, empire, to, war, with, rome, again, on, his, return, journey, according, to, josephus, he, made, an, expedition, to, judea, took, jerusalem, by, force, slew, a, great, many, who, had, favored, ptolemy, sent, his, soldiers, to, plunder, them, without, mercy, he, also, spoiled, the, temple, and, interrupted, the, constant, practice, of, offering, a, daily, sacrifice, of, expiation, for, three, years, and, six, months, the, latter, part, of, his, reign, saw, a, further, disintegration, of, the, empire, despite, his, best, efforts, weakened, economically, militarily, and, by, loss, of, prestige, the, empire, became, vulnerable, to, rebels, in, the, eastern, areas, of, the, empire, who, began, to, further, undermine, the, empire, while, the, parthians, moved, into, the, power, vacuum, to, take, over, the, old, persian, lands, antiochus, aggressive, hellenizing, or, de, judaizing, activities, provoked, a, full, scale, armed, rebellion, in, judea, the, maccabean, revolt, efforts, to, deal, with, both, the, parthians, and, the, jews, as, well, as, retain, control, of, the, provinces, at, the, same, time, proved, beyond, the, weakened, empire, s, power, antiochus, orchestrated, a, military, campaign, capturing, artaxias, i, king, of, armenia, and, reoccupying, armenia, his, offensive, ventured, as, far, as, persepolis, but, he, was, forced, from, the, city, by, the, populace, on, his, return, home, antiochus, died, in, isfahan, in, 164, bc, after, the, death, of, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, the, seleucid, empire, became, increasingly, unstable, frequent, civil, wars, made, central, authority, tenuous, at, best, epiphanes, young, son, antiochus, v, eupator, was, first, overthrown, by, seleucus, iv, s, son, demetrius, i, soter, in, 161, bc, demetrius, i, attempted, to, restore, seleucid, power, in, judea, particularly, but, was, overthrown, in, 150, bc, by, alexander, balas, an, impostor, who, with, egyptian, backing, claimed, to, be, the, son, of, epiphanes, alexander, balas, reigned, until, 145, bc, when, he, was, overthrown, by, demetrius, i, s, son, demetrius, ii, nicator, demetrius, ii, proved, unable, to, control, the, whole, of, the, kingdom, however, while, he, ruled, babylonia, and, eastern, syria, from, damascus, the, remnants, of, balas, supporters, first, supporting, balas, son, antiochus, vi, then, the, usurping, general, diodotus, tryphon, held, out, in, antioch, meanwhile, the, decay, of, the, empire, s, territorial, possessions, continued, apace, by, 143, bc, the, jews, in, the, form, of, the, maccabees, had, fully, established, their, independence, parthian, expansion, continued, as, well, in, 139, bc, demetrius, ii, was, defeated, in, battle, by, the, parthians, and, was, captured, by, this, time, the, entire, iranian, plateau, had, been, lost, to, parthian, control, demetrius, nicator, s, brother, antiochus, vii, sidetes, took, the, throne, after, his, brother, s, capture, he, faced, the, enormous, task, of, restoring, a, rapidly, crumbling, empire, one, facing, threats, on, multiple, fronts, hard, won, control, of, coele, syria, was, threatened, by, the, jewish, maccabee, rebels, once, vassal, dynasties, in, armenia, cappadocia, and, pontus, were, threatening, syria, and, northern, mesopotamia, the, nomadic, parthians, brilliantly, led, by, mithridates, i, of, parthia, had, overrun, upland, media, home, of, the, famed, nisean, horse, herd, and, roman, intervention, was, an, ever, present, threat, sidetes, managed, to, bring, the, maccabees, to, heel, and, frighten, the, anatolian, dynasts, into, a, temporary, submission, then, in, 133, he, turned, east, with, the, full, might, of, the, royal, army, supported, by, a, body, of, jews, under, the, hasmonean, prince, john, hyrcanus, to, drive, back, the, parthians, sidetes, campaign, initially, met, with, spectacular, success, recapturing, mesopotamia, babylonia, and, media, in, the, winter, of, 130, 129, bc, his,

at, his, immediate, disposal, he, was, ambushed, and, killed, at, the, battle, of, ecbatana, in, 129, bc, antiochus, sidetes, is, sometimes, called, the, last, great, seleucid, king, after, the, death, of, antiochus, vii, sidetes, all, of, the, recovered, eastern, territories, were, recaptured, by, the, parthians, the, maccabees, again, rebelled, civil, war, soon, tore, the, empire, to, pieces, and, the, armenians, began, to, encroach, on, syria, from, the, north, by, 100, bc, the, once, formidable, seleucid, empire, encompassed, little, more, than, antioch, and, some, syrian, cities, despite, the, clear, collapse, of, their, power, and, the, decline, of, their, kingdom, around, them, nobles, continued, to, play, kingmakers, on, a, regular, basis, with, occasional, intervention, from, ptolemaic, egypt, and, other, outside, powers, the, seleucids, existed, solely, because, no, other, nation, wished, to, absorb, them, seeing, as, they, constituted, a, useful, buffer, between, their, other, neighbours, in, the, wars, in, anatolia, between, mithridates, vi, of, pontus, and, sulla, of, rome, the, seleucids, were, largely, left, alone, by, both, major, combatants, mithridates, ambitious, son, in, law, tigranes, the, great, king, of, armenia, however, saw, opportunity, for, expansion, in, the, constant, civil, strife, to, the, south, in, 83, bc, at, the, invitation, of, one, of, the, factions, in, the, interminable, civil, wars, he, invaded, syria, and, soon, established, himself, as, ruler, of, syria, putting, the, seleucid, empire, virtually, at, an, end, seleucid, rule, was, not, entirely, over, however, following, the, roman, general, lucullus, defeat, of, both, mithridates, and, tigranes, in, 69, bc, a, rump, seleucid, kingdom, was, restored, under, antiochus, xiii, even, so, civil, wars, could, not, be, prevented, as, another, seleucid, philip, ii, contested, rule, with, antiochus, after, the, roman, conquest, of, pontus, the, romans, became, increasingly, alarmed, at, the, constant, source, of, instability, in, syria, under, the, seleucids, once, mithridates, was, defeated, by, pompey, in, 63, bc, pompey, set, about, the, task, of, remaking, the, hellenistic, east, by, creating, new, client, kingdoms, and, establishing, provinces, while, client, nations, like, armenia, and, judea, were, allowed, to, continue, with, some, degree, of, autonomy, under, local, kings, pompey, saw, the, seleucids, as, too, troublesome, to, continue, doing, away, with, both, rival, seleucid, princes, he, made, syria, into, a, roman, province, the, domain, of, the, seleucids, stretched, from, the, aegean, sea, to, what, is, now, afghanistan, and, pakistan, therefore, including, a, diverse, array, of, cultures, and, ethnic, groups, greeks, assyrians, armenians, georgians, persians, medes, mesopotamians, jews, and, more, all, lived, within, its, bounds, the, immense, size, of, the, empire, gave, the, seleucid, rulers, a, difficult, balancing, act, to, maintain, order, resulting, in, a, mixture, of, concessions, to, local, cultures, to, maintain, their, own, practices, while, also, firmly, controlling, and, unifying, local, elites, under, the, seleucid, banner, the, government, established, greek, cities, and, settlements, throughout, the, empire, via, a, program, of, colonization, that, encouraged, immigration, from, greece, both, city, settlements, as, well, as, rural, ones, were, created, that, were, inhabited, by, ethnic, greeks, these, greeks, were, given, good, land, and, privileges, and, in, exchange, were, expected, to, serve, in, military, service, for, the, state, despite, being, a, tiny, minority, of, the, overall, population, these, greeks, were, the, backbone, of, the, empire, loyal, and, committed, to, a, cause, that, gave, them, vast, territory, to, rule, they, overwhelmingly, served, in, the, military, and, government, unlike, ptolemaic, egypt, greeks, in, the, seleucid, empire, seem, to, rarely, have, engaged, in, mixed, marriages, with, non, greeks, they, kept, to, their, own, cities, the, various, non, greek, peoples, of, the, empire, were, still, influenced, by, the, spread, of, greek, thought, and, culture, a, phenomenon, referred, to, as, hellenization, historically, significant, towns, and, cities, such, as, antioch, were, created, or, renamed, with, greek, names, and, hundreds, of, new, cities, were, established, for, trade, purposes, and, built, in, greek, style, from, the, start, local, educated, elites, who, needed, to, work, with, the, government, learned, the, greek, language, wrote, in, greek, absorbed, greek, philosophical, ideas, and, took, on, greek, names, some, of, these, practices, then, slowly, filtered, down, to, the, lower, classes, hellenic, ideas, began, an, almost, 250, year, expansion, into, the, near, east, middle, east, and, central, asian, cultures, synthesizing, hellenic, and, indigenous, cultural, religious, and, philosophical, ideas, an, ethnic, unity, framework, established, by, alexander, met, with, varying, degrees, of, success, the, result, was, times, of, simultaneous, peace, and, rebellion, in, various, parts, of, the, empire, in, general, the, seleucids, allowed, local, religions, to, operate, undisturbed, such, as, incorporating, babylonian, religious, tenets, to, gain, support, tensions, around, the, integration, of, judaism, were, present, during, the, reign, of, the, seleucid, governments, though, previous, governments, had, managed, a, relatively, seamless, integration, of, judean, religious, and, cultural, practices, the, rule, of, antiochus, iv, introduced, significant, changes, antiochus, iv, instigated, a, bidding, process, for, the, high, priest, position, this, led, to, menelaus, a, radical, hellenist, outbidding, jason, a, moderate, hellenist, who, upheld, many, traditional, judean, practices, the, shift, from, jason, to, menelaus, unsettled, the, jewish, populace, due, to, menelaus, s, more, extreme, hellenistic, leanings, aggravating, the, situation, antiochus, iv, initiated, a, series, of, religious, persecutions, this, cumulated, in, a, localized, revolt, in, jerusalem, antiochus, iv, s, violent, retaking, of, the, city, and, the, banning, of, traditional, judean, practices, led, to, the, eventual, loss, of, control, of, judea, by, the, seleucid, government, paving, the, way, for, the, rise, of, an, independent, hasmonean, kingdom, as, with, the, other, major, hellenistic, armies, the, seleucid, army, fought, primarily, in, the, greco, macedonian, style, with, its, main, body, being, the, phalanx, the, phalanx, was, a, large, dense, formation, of, men, armed, with, small, shields, and, a, long, pike, called, the, sarissa, this, form, of, fighting, had, been, developed, by, the, macedonian, army, in, the, reign, of, philip, ii, of, macedon, and, his, son, alexander, the, great, alongside, the, phalanx, the, seleucid, armies, used, numerous, native, and, mercenary, troops, to, supplement, their, greek, forces, which, were, limited, due, to, the, distance, from, the, seleucid, rulers, macedonian, homeland, the, size, of, the, seleucid, army, usually, varied, between, 70, 000, and, 200, 000, in, manpower, the, distance, from, greece, put, a, strain, on, the, seleucid, military, system, as, it, was, primarily, based, around, the, recruitment, of, greeks, as, the, key, segment, of, the, army, in, order, to, increase, the, population, of, greeks, in, their, kingdom, the, seleucid, rulers, created, military, settlements, there, were, two, main, periods, in, the, establishment, of, settlements, firstly, under, seleucus, i, nicator, and, antiochus, i, soter, and, then, under, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, the, military, settlers, were, given, land, varying, in, size, according, to, rank, and, arm, of, service, they, were, settled, in, colonies, of, an, urban, character, which, at, some, point, could, acquire, the, status, of, a, polis, the, settler, soldiers, were, called, katoikoi, they, would, maintain, the, land, as, their, own, and, in, return, they, would, serve, in, the, seleucid, army, when, called, the, majority, of, settlements, were, concentrated, in, lydia, northern, syria, the, upper, euphrates, and, media, antiochus, iii, brought, greeks, from, euboea, crete, and, aetolia, and, settled, them, in, antioch, these, greek, settlers, would, be, used, to, form, the, seleucid, phalanx, and, cavalry, units, with, picked, men, put, into, the, kingdom, s, guards, regiments, the, rest, of, the, seleucid, army, would, consist, of, native, and, mercenary, troops, who, would, serve, as, light, auxiliary, troops, while, the, seleucids, were, happy, to, recruit, from, less, populated, and, outlying, parts, of, the, empire, such, as, the, arabs, and, jews, iranian, peoples, in, the, east, and, inhabitants, of, asia, minor, to, the, north, they, generally, eschewed, recruiting, native, syrians, and, native, mesopotamians, babylonians, this, was, presumably, mostly, from, a, desire, not, to, train, and, arm, the, people, who, were, an, overwhelming, majority, in, the, trade, and, governmental, centers, of, the, empire, in, antioch, and, babylon, risking, revolt, while, a, revolt, in, a, remote, place, could, be, put, down, by, resolute, action, from, the, center, an, uprising, in, syria, coele, would, have, undermined, the, kingdom, s, very, existence, following, losses, of, territory, in, asia, minor, during, the, roman, seleucid, war, king, antiochus, iv, sponsored, a, new, wave, of, immigration, and, settlements, to, replace, them, and, maintain, enough, greeks, to, staff, the, phalanxes, seen, at, the, military, parade, at, daphne, in, 166, 165, bc, antiochus, iv, built, 15, new, cities, and, their, association, with, the, increased, phalanx, at, daphne, is, too, obvious, to, be, ignored, as, a, hegemonic, empire, much, of, the, state, s, wealth, accumulation, centered, around, maintaining, its, sizable, military, while, the, motive, is, simple, enough, the, seleucid, empire, boasts, of, a, sophisticated, political, economy, that, extracts, wealth, from, local, temples, cities, or, poleis, and, royal, estates, much, of, which, was, inherited, from, their, achaemenid, predecessors, recent, discussion, indicates, a, market, oriented, economy, under, the, seleucids, however, evidencing, limits, our, understanding, of, the, seleucid, economy, to, the, hellenistic, near, east, that, is, through, their, holdings, in, syria, asia, minor, and, mesopotamia, little, is, known, about, the, economy, of, the, upper, satrapies, currency, plays, an, increasingly, central, role, under, the, seleucids, however, we, should, note, that, monetization, was, nothing, new, in, their, newly, acquired, lands, rather, the, introduction, and, widespread, implementation, of, currency, is, attributed, to, darius, i, s, tax, reforms, centuries, prior, hence, the, seleucids, see, a, continuation, rather, than, shift, in, this, practice, i, e, the, payment, of, taxation, in, silver, or, if, necessary, in, kind, in, this, regard, the, seleucids, are, notable, for, paying, their, sizeable, armies, exclusively, in, silver, nevertheless, there, are, two, significant, developments, of, currency, during, the, seleucid, period, the, adoption, of, the, attic, standard, in, certain, regions, and, the, popularization, of, bronze, coinage, the, adoption, of, the, attic, standard, was, not, uniform, across, the, realm, the, attic, standard, was, already, the, common, currency, of, the, mediterranean, prior, to, alexander, s, conquest, that, is, it, was, the, preferred, currency, for, foreign, transactions, as, a, result, coastal, regions, under, the, seleucids, syria, and, asia, minor, were, quick, to, adopt, the, new, standard, in, mesopotamia, however, the, millennia, old, shekel, weighing, 8, 33, g, silver, prevailed, over, the, attic, standard, according, to, historian, r, j, van, der, spek, this, is, due, to, their, particular, method, in, recording, price, which, favored, bartering, over, monetary, transactions, the, mesopotamians, used, the, value, of, one, shekel, as, a, fixed, reference, point, against, which, the, amount, of, a, good, is, given, prices, themselves, are, accounted, in, terms, of, their, weight, in, silver, per, ton, e, g, 60, g, silver, barley, june, 242, bc, the, minute, difference, in, weight, between, a, shekel, and, didrachm, weighing, 8, 6, g, silver, could, not, be, expressed, in, this, barter, system, and, the, a, greek, tetradrachm, would, be, a, far, too, heavy, denomination, in, daily, trade, bronze, coinage, dating, from, the, late, fifth, and, fourth, century, was, popularized, as, a, fiduciary, currency, facilitating, small, scale, exchanges, in, the, hellenistic, period, it, was, principally, a, legal, tender, which, circulated, only, around, its, locales, of, production, however, the, great, seleucid, mint, at, antioch, during, antiochus, iii, s, reign, which, numismatist, arthur, houghton, dubs, the, syrian, and, coele, syrian, experiment, began, minting, bronze, coins, weighing, 1, 25, 1, 5g, to, serve, a, regional, purpose, the, reasons, behind, this, remain, unclear, however, spek, notes, a, chronic, shortage, of, silver, in, the, seleucid, empire, in, fact, antiochus, i, s, heavy, withdrawal, of, silver, from, a, satrap, is, noted, by, the, babylonian, astronomical, diary, ad, no, 273, b, rev, 33, purchases, in, babylon, and, other, cities, were, made, in, greek, bronze, coins, this, was, unprecedented, because, in, official, documents, played, no, part, it, was, a, sign, of, hardship, for, the, seleucids, nevertheless, the, low, denomination, of, bronze, coinage, meant, it, was, used, in, tandem, with, bartering, making, it, a, popular, and, successful, medium, of, exchange, agriculture, like, most, pre, modern, economies, constituted, a, vast, majority, of, the, seleucid, economy, somewhere, between, 80, and, 90, of, the, seleucid, population, was, employed, in, some, form, within, the, prevailing, agricultural, structures, inherited, from, their, neo, babylonian, and, achaemenid, predecessors, these, included, temples, poleis, and, royal, estates, we, should, clarify, that, the, term, poleis, according, to, spek, did, not, confer, any, special, status, to, cities, in, the, seleucid, sources, it, was, simply, the, term, for, city, greek, or, otherwise, regardless, agricultural, produce, varied, from, region, to, region, but, in, general, greek, poleis, produced, grain, olives, and, their, oil, wine, figs, cheese, from, sheep, and, goats, meat, whereas, mesopotamian, production, from, temple, land, consisted, of, barley, dates, mustard, or, cascuta, dodder, cress, cardamom, sesame, and, wool, which, as, the, core, region, of, the, seleucid, empire, was, also, the, most, productive, recent, evidence, indicates, that, mesopotamian, grain, production, under, the, seleucids, was, subject, to, market, forces, of, supply, and, demand, traditional, primitivist, narratives, of, the, ancient, economy, argue, that, it, was, marketless, however, the, babylonian, astronomical, diaries, show, a, high, degree, of, market, integration, of, barley, and, date, prices, to, name, a, few, in, seleucid, babylonia, prices, exceeding, 370g, silver, per, ton, in, seleucid, mesopotamia, was, considered, a, sign, of, famine, therefore, during, periods, of, war, heavy, taxation, and, crop, failure, prices, increase, drastically, in, an, extreme, example, spek, believes, tribal, arab, raiding, into, babylonia, caused, barley, prices, to, skyrocket, to, 1493, grams, of, silver, per, ton, from, 5, 8, may, 124, bc, the, average, mesopotamian, peasant, if, working, for, a, wage, at, a, temple, would, receive, 1, shekel, it, was, a, reasonable, monthly, wage, for, which, one, could, buy, one, kor, of, grain, 180, while, this, appears, dire, we, should, be, reminded, that, mesopotamia, under, the, seleucids, was, largely, stable, and, prices, remained, low, with, encouraged, greek, colonization, and, land, reclamation, increasing, the, supply, of, grain, production, however, the, question, of, whether, this, artificially, kept, prices, stable, is, uncertain, the, seleucids, also, continued, the, tradition, of, actively, maintaining, the, mesopotamian, waterways, as, the, greatest, source, of, state, income, the, seleucid, kings, actively, managed, the, irrigation, reclamation, and, population, of, mesopotamia, in, fact, canals, were, often, dug, by, royal, decrees, to, which, some, were, called, the, king, s, canal, for, that, reason, for, example, the, construction, of, the, pallacottas, canal, was, able, to, control, the, water, level, of, the, euphrates, which, as, arrian, notes, in, his, anabasis, 7, 21, 5, required, over, two, months, of, work, by, more, than, 10, 000, assyrians, as, a, hegemonic, empire, the, state, s, primary, focus, was, maintaining, its, sizable, army, via, wealth, extraction, from, three, major, sources, tribute, from, autonomous, poleis, and, temples, and, proportional, land, tax, from, royal, land, the, definition, of, royal, land, remains, contested, while, all, agree, poleis, do, not, constitute, royal, land, some, remain, uncertain, over, the, status, of, temple, land, yet, they, commanded, notable, economic, power, and, functioned, almost, independently, from, the, state, nevertheless, the, seleucid, manner, of, extraction, in, contrast, to, earlier, regimes, is, considered, more, aggressive, and, predatory, in, theory, the, seleucid, state, was, an, absolute, monarchy, that, did, not, recognize, private, property, in, our, modern, sense, any, land, that, was, not, delegated, to, the, poleis, or, temples, was, considered, private, property, of, the, sovereign, thus, considered, as, royal, land, and, liable, to, direct, tax, by, the, state, here, a, proportional, land, tax, that, is, a, tax, based, on, the, size, of, one, s, plot, is, collected, by, the, local, governor, or, satrap, and, sent, to, the, capital, however, there, is, no, evidence, for, the, amount, that, was, taxed, on, any, given, region, tribute, was, heavily, levied, on, poleis, and, temples, although, tribute, is, paid, annually, the, amount, demanded, increases, significantly, during, wartime, during, a, civil, war, in, 149, bc, demetrius, ii, demanded, the, province, of, judaea, to, pay, 300, talents, of, silver, which, was, seen, as, severe, but, this, was, far, from, an, isolated, case, in, fact, the, babylonian, astronomical, diaries, in, 308, 7, bc, note, a, hefty, 50, tax, on, harvest, from, the, lands, of, the, temple, of, shamash, in, sipprar, or, larsa, nevertheless, annual, tribute, was, a, long, accepted, and, uncontroversial, practice, also, royal, land, was, regularly, donated, to, the, temples, and, poleis, albeit, under, the, assumption, that, a, greater, share, of, revenue, is, given, to, the, state, in, exchange, the, controversial, practice, of, temple, despoliation, however, was, a, regular, occurrence, under, the, seleucids, in, contrast, to, earlier, times, although, the, seleucid, kings, were, aware, and, appreciated, the, sacrosanctity, of, religious, treasures, their, concentration, in, these, places, proved, irresistible, in, the, face, of, short, term, fiscal, constraints, as, an, example, antiochus, iii, s, despoliation, of, the, anahit, temple, in, ecbatana, wherein, he, procured, 4000, silver, talents, was, used, to, fund, his, great, eastern, campaign, according, to, historian, michael, j, taylor, it, is, difficult, to, believe, that, these, monarchs, who, knew, enough, to, bow, before, nabu, bake, bricks, for, esagil, and, enforce, kosher, regulations, in, jerusalem, would, be, blithely, aware, of, the, political, hazards, of, removing, temple, treasures, it, is, more, likely, that, they, knew, the, risks, but, took, them, anyway, a, rebellion, in, 169, bc, during, antiochus, iii, s, campaign, in, egypt, demonstrates, that, these, risks, occasionally, backfire, the, increasingly, bold, interference, is, due, in, large, part, to, the, appointment, of, provincial, high, priests, by, the, monarch, himself, often, they, were, his, court, favorites, whose, prerogatives, were, purely, administrative, essentially, they, served, to, collect, tribute, for, the, state, unsurprisingly, native, elites, profoundly, feared, that, the, arrival, of, a, seleucid, official, might, quickly, cascade, into, a, wholesale, removal, of, temple, treasures, interpretations, on, the, seleucid, economy, since, the, late, 19th, century, traditionally, fell, between, the, modernist, and, primitivist, camps, on, one, hand, the, modernist, view, largely, associated, with, michael, rostovtzeff, and, eduard, meyer, argues, that, the, hellenistic, economies, operated, along, price, setting, markets, with, capitalist, enterprises, exported, over, long, distances, in, completely, monetarized, markets, on, the, other, hand, the, primitivist, view, associated, with, m, i, finley, karl, polanyi, and, karl, b, cher, interprets, ancient, economies, as, autarchic, in, nature, with, little, to, no, interaction, among, each, other, however, recent, discussion, has, since, criticized, these, models, for, their, grounding, on, greco, centric, sources, recent, discussion, has, since, rejected, these, traditional, dichotomies, according, to, spek, and, reger, the, current, view, is, that, the, seleucid, economy, and, hellenistic, economies, more, broadly, were, partially, market, oriented, and, partially, monetarized, while, the, market, was, subject, to, forces, of, supply, and, demand, a, majority, of, produce, was, still, consumed, by, their, producers, and, was, hence,
