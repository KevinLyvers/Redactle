confucian, teachings, and, to, educate, more, and, more, eligible, candidates, for, the, exams, this, can, be, seen, in, the, number, of, exam, takers, for, the, low, level, prefectural, exams, rising, from, 30, 000, annual, candidates, in, the, early, 11th, century, to, 400, 000, candidates, by, the, late, 13th, century, the, civil, service, and, examination, system, allowed, for, greater, meritocracy, social, mobility, and, equality, in, competition, for, those, wishing, to, attain, an, official, seat, in, government, using, statistics, gathered, by, the, song, state, edward, a, kracke, sud, yoshiyuki, and, ho, ping, ti, supported, the, hypothesis, that, simply, having, a, father, grandfather, or, great, grandfather, who, had, served, as, an, official, of, state, did, not, guarantee, one, would, obtain, the, same, level, of, authority, robert, hartwell, and, robert, p, hymes, criticized, this, model, stating, that, it, places, too, much, emphasis, on, the, role, of, the, nuclear, family, and, considers, only, three, paternal, ascendants, of, exam, candidates, while, ignoring, the, demographic, reality, of, song, china, the, significant, proportion, of, males, in, each, generation, that, had, no, surviving, sons, and, the, role, of, the, extended, family, many, felt, disenfranchised, by, what, they, saw, as, a, bureaucratic, system, that, favored, the, land, holding, class, able, to, afford, the, best, education, one, of, the, greatest, literary, critics, of, this, was, the, official, and, famous, poet, su, shi, yet, su, was, a, product, of, his, times, as, the, identity, habits, and, attitudes, of, the, scholar, official, had, become, less, aristocratic, and, more, bureaucratic, with, the, transition, of, the, periods, from, tang, to, song, at, the, beginning, of, the, dynasty, government, posts, were, disproportionately, held, by, two, elite, social, groups, a, founding, elite, who, had, ties, with, the, founding, emperor, and, a, semi, hereditary, professional, elite, who, used, long, held, clan, status, family, connections, and, marriage, alliances, to, secure, appointments, by, the, late, 11th, century, the, founding, elite, became, obsolete, while, political, partisanship, and, factionalism, at, court, undermined, the, marriage, strategies, of, the, professional, elite, which, dissolved, as, a, distinguishable, social, group, and, was, replaced, by, a, multitude, of, gentry, families, due, to, song, s, enormous, population, growth, and, the, body, of, its, appointed, scholar, officials, being, accepted, in, limited, numbers, about, 20, 000, active, officials, during, the, song, period, the, larger, scholarly, gentry, class, would, now, take, over, grassroots, affairs, on, the, vast, local, level, excluding, the, scholar, officials, in, office, this, elite, social, class, consisted, of, exam, candidates, examination, degree, holders, not, yet, assigned, to, an, official, post, local, tutors, and, retired, officials, these, learned, men, degree, holders, and, local, elites, supervised, local, affairs, and, sponsored, necessary, facilities, of, local, communities, any, local, magistrate, appointed, to, his, office, by, the, government, relied, upon, the, cooperation, of, the, few, or, many, local, gentry, in, the, area, for, example, the, song, government, excluding, the, educational, reformist, government, under, emperor, huizong, spared, little, amount, of, state, revenue, to, maintain, prefectural, and, county, schools, instead, the, bulk, of, the, funds, for, schools, was, drawn, from, private, financing, this, limited, role, of, government, officials, was, a, departure, from, the, earlier, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, when, the, government, strictly, regulated, commercial, markets, and, local, affairs, now, the, government, withdrew, heavily, from, regulating, commerce, and, relied, upon, a, mass, of, local, gentry, to, perform, necessary, duties, in, their, communities, the, gentry, distinguished, themselves, in, society, through, their, intellectual, and, antiquarian, pursuits, while, the, homes, of, prominent, landholders, attracted, a, variety, of, courtiers, including, artisans, artists, educational, tutors, and, entertainers, despite, the, disdain, for, trade, commerce, and, the, merchant, class, exhibited, by, the, highly, cultured, and, elite, exam, drafted, scholar, officials, commercialism, played, a, prominent, role, in, song, culture, and, society, a, scholar, official, would, be, frowned, upon, by, his, peers, if, he, pursued, means, of, profiteering, outside, of, his, official, salary, however, this, did, not, stop, many, scholar, officials, from, managing, business, relations, through, the, use, of, intermediary, agents, the, song, judicial, system, retained, most, of, the, legal, code, of, the, earlier, tang, dynasty, the, basis, of, traditional, chinese, law, up, until, the, modern, era, roving, sheriffs, maintained, law, and, order, in, the, municipal, jurisdictions, and, occasionally, ventured, into, the, countryside, official, magistrates, overseeing, court, cases, were, not, only, expected, to, be, well, versed, in, written, law, but, also, to, promote, morality, in, society, magistrates, such, as, the, famed, bao, zheng, 999, 1062, embodied, the, upright, moral, judge, who, upheld, justice, and, never, failed, to, live, up, to, his, principles, song, judges, specified, the, guilty, person, or, party, in, a, criminal, act, and, meted, out, punishments, accordingly, often, in, the, form, of, caning, a, guilty, individual, or, parties, brought, to, court, for, a, criminal, or, civil, offense, were, not, viewed, as, wholly, innocent, until, proven, otherwise, while, even, accusers, were, viewed, with, a, high, level, of, suspicion, by, the, judge, due, to, costly, court, expenses, and, immediate, jailing, of, those, accused, of, criminal, offenses, people, in, the, song, preferred, to, settle, disputes, and, quarrels, privately, without, the, court, s, interference, shen, kuo, s, dream, pool, essays, argued, against, traditional, chinese, beliefs, in, anatomy, such, as, his, argument, for, two, throat, valves, instead, of, three, this, perhaps, spurred, the, interest, in, the, performance, of, post, mortem, autopsies, in, china, during, the, 12th, century, the, physician, and, judge, known, as, song, ci, 1186, 1249, wrote, a, pioneering, work, of, forensic, science, on, the, examination, of, corpses, in, order, to, determine, cause, of, death, strangulation, poisoning, drowning, blows, etc, and, to, prove, whether, death, resulted, from, murder, suicide, or, accidental, death, song, ci, stressed, the, importance, of, proper, coroner, s, conduct, during, autopsies, and, the,

world, s, oldest, known, terrain, map, in, printed, form, comes, from, the, edited, encyclopedia, of, yang, jia, in, 1155, which, displayed, western, china, without, the, formal, grid, system, that, was, characteristic, of, more, professionally, made, chinese, maps, although, gazetteers, had, existed, since, 52, ce, during, the, han, dynasty, and, gazetteers, accompanied, by, illustrative, maps, chinese, tujing, since, the, sui, dynasty, the, illustrated, gazetteer, became, much, more, common, during, the, song, dynasty, when, the, foremost, concern, was, for, illustrative, gazetteers, to, serve, political, administrative, and, military, purposes, the, innovation, of, movable, type, printing, was, made, by, the, artisan, bi, sheng, 990, 1051, first, described, by, the, scientist, and, statesman, shen, kuo, in, his, dream, pool, essays, of, 1088, the, collection, of, bi, sheng, s, original, clay, fired, typeface, was, passed, on, to, one, of, shen, kuo, s, nephews, and, was, carefully, preserved, movable, type, enhanced, the, already, widespread, use, of, woodblock, methods, of, printing, thousands, of, documents, and, volumes, of, written, literature, consumed, eagerly, by, an, increasingly, literate, public, the, advancement, of, printing, deeply, affected, education, and, the, scholar, official, class, since, more, books, could, be, made, faster, while, mass, produced, printed, books, were, cheaper, in, comparison, to, laborious, handwritten, copies, the, enhancement, of, widespread, printing, and, print, culture, in, the, song, period, was, thus, a, direct, catalyst, in, the, rise, of, social, mobility, and, expansion, of, the, educated, class, of, scholar, elites, the, latter, which, expanded, dramatically, in, size, from, the, 11th, to, 13th, centuries, the, movable, type, invented, by, bi, sheng, was, ultimately, trumped, by, the, use, of, woodblock, printing, due, to, the, limitations, of, chinese, characters, yet, movable, type, printing, continued, to, be, used, and, was, improved, in, later, periods, the, yuan, scholar, official, wang, zhen, fl, 1290, 1333, implemented, a, faster, typesetting, process, improved, bi, s, baked, clay, movable, type, character, set, with, a, wooden, one, and, experimented, with, tin, metal, movable, type, the, wealthy, printing, patron, hua, sui, 1439, 1513, of, the, ming, dynasty, established, china, s, first, metal, movable, type, using, bronze, in, 1490, in, 1638, the, peking, gazette, switched, their, printing, process, from, woodblock, to, movable, type, printing, yet, it, was, during, the, qing, dynasty, that, massive, printing, projects, began, to, employ, movable, type, printing, this, includes, the, printing, of, sixty, six, copies, of, a, 5, 020, volume, long, encyclopedia, in, 1725, the, complete, classics, collection, of, ancient, china, which, necessitated, the, crafting, of, 250, 000, movable, type, characters, cast, in, bronze, by, the, 19th, century, the, european, style, printing, press, replaced, the, old, chinese, methods, of, movable, type, while, traditional, woodblock, printing, in, modern, east, asia, is, used, sparsely, and, for, aesthetic, reasons, the, most, important, nautical, innovation, of, the, song, period, seems, to, have, been, the, introduction, of, the, magnetic, mariner, s, compass, which, permitted, accurate, navigation, on, the, open, sea, regardless, of, the, weather, the, magnetized, compass, needle, known, in, chinese, as, the, south, pointing, needle, was, first, described, by, shen, kuo, in, his, 1088, dream, pool, essays, and, first, mentioned, in, active, use, by, sailors, in, zhu, yu, s, 1119, pingzhou, table, talks, there, were, other, considerable, advancements, in, hydraulic, engineering, and, nautical, technology, during, the, song, dynasty, the, 10th, century, invention, of, the, pound, lock, for, canal, systems, allowed, different, water, levels, to, be, raised, and, lowered, for, separated, segments, of, a, canal, which, significantly, aided, the, safety, of, canal, traffic, and, allowed, for, larger, barges, there, was, the, song, era, innovation, of, watertight, bulkhead, compartments, that, allowed, damage, to, hulls, without, sinking, the, ships, if, ships, were, damaged, the, chinese, of, the, 11th, century, employed, drydocks, to, repair, them, while, suspended, out, of, the, water, the, song, used, crossbeams, to, brace, the, ribs, of, ships, in, order, to, strengthen, them, in, a, skeletal, like, structure, stern, mounted, rudders, had, been, mounted, on, chinese, ships, since, the, 1st, century, as, evidenced, by, a, preserved, han, tomb, model, of, a, ship, in, the, song, period, the, chinese, devised, a, way, to, mechanically, raise, and, lower, rudders, in, order, for, ships, to, travel, in, a, wider, range, of, water, depths, the, song, arranged, the, protruding, teeth, of, anchors, in, a, circular, pattern, instead, of, in, one, direction, david, graff, and, robin, higham, state, that, this, arrangement, them, more, reliable, for, anchoring, ships, architecture, during, the, song, period, reached, new, heights, of, sophistication, authors, such, as, yu, hao, and, shen, kuo, wrote, books, outlining, the, field, of, architectural, layouts, craftsmanship, and, structural, engineering, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, respectively, shen, kuo, preserved, the, written, dialogues, of, yu, hao, when, describing, technical, issues, such, as, slanting, struts, built, into, pagoda, towers, for, diagonal, wind, bracing, shen, kuo, also, preserved, yu, s, specified, dimensions, and, units, of, measurement, for, various, building, types, the, architect, li, jie, 1065, 1110, who, published, the, yingzao, fashi, treatise, on, architectural, methods, in, 1103, greatly, expanded, upon, the, works, of, yu, hao, and, compiled, the, standard, building, codes, used, by, the, central, government, agencies, and, by, craftsmen, throughout, the, empire, he, addressed, the, standard, methods, of, construction, design, and, applications, of, moats, and, fortifications, stonework, greater, woodwork,

various, applications, of, corbel, brackets, cantilever, arms, mortise, and, tenon, work, of, tie, beams, and, cross, beams, and, diagrams, showing, the, various, building, types, of, halls, in, graded, sizes, he, also, outlined, the, standard, units, of, measurement, and, standard, dimensional, measurements, of, all, building, components, described, and, illustrated, in, his, book, grandiose, building, projects, were, supported, by, the, government, including, the, erection, of, towering, buddhist, chinese, pagodas, and, the, construction, of, enormous, bridges, wood, or, stone, trestle, or, segmental, arch, bridge, many, of, the, pagoda, towers, built, during, the, song, period, were, erected, at, heights, that, exceeded, ten, stories, some, of, the, most, famous, are, the, iron, pagoda, built, in, 1049, during, the, northern, song, and, the, liuhe, pagoda, built, in, 1165, during, the, southern, song, though, there, were, others, the, tallest, is, the, liaodi, pagoda,

towers, and, distinct, chinese, city, walls, the, scientist, and, statesman, shen, kuo, was, known, for, his, criticism, relating, to, architecture, saying, that, it, was, more, important, for, an, artist, to, capture, a, holistic, view, of, a, landscape, than, it, was, to, focus, on, the, angles, and, corners, of, buildings, for, example, shen, criticized, the, work, of, the, painter, li, cheng, for, failing, to, observe, the, principle, of, seeing, the, small, from, the, viewpoint, of, the, large, in, portraying, buildings, there, were, also, pyramidal, tomb, structures, in, the,

relics, from, archaeological, sites, in, order, to, revive, the, use, of, ancient, vessels, in, ceremonies, of, state, ritual, scholar, officials, of, the, song, period, claimed, to, have, discovered, ancient, bronze, vessels, that, were, created, as, far, back, as, the, shang, dynasty, 1600, 1046, bce, which, bore, the, oracle, bone, script, of, the, shang, era, some, attempted, to, recreate, these, bronze, vessels, by, using, imagination, alone, not, by, observing, tangible, evidence, of, relics, this, practice, was, criticized, by, shen, kuo, in, his, work, of, 1088, yet, shen, kuo, had, much, more, to, criticize, than, this, practice, alone, shen, objected, to, the, idea, of, his, peers, that, ancient, relics, were, products, created, by, famous, sages, in, lore, or, the, ancient, aristocratic, class, shen, rightfully, attributed, the, discovered, handicrafts, and, vessels, from, ancient, times, as, the, work, of, artisans, and, commoners, from, previous, eras, he, also, disapproved, of, his, peers, pursuit, of, archaeology, simply, to, enhance, state, ritual, since, shen, not, only, took, an, interdisciplinary, approach, with, the, study, of, archaeology, but, he, also, emphasized, the, study, of, functionality, and, investigating, what, was, the, ancient, relics, original, processes, of, manufacture, shen, used, ancient, texts, and, existing, models, of, armillary, spheres, to, create, one, based, on, ancient, standards, shen, described, ancient, weaponry, such, as, the, use, of, a, scaled, sighting, device, on, crossbows, while, experimenting, with, ancient, musical, measures, shen, suggested, hanging, an, ancient, bell, by, using, a, hollow, handle, despite, the, gentry, s, overriding, interest, in, archaeology, simply, for, reviving, ancient, state, rituals, some, of, shen, s, peers, took, a, similar, approach, to, the, study, of, archaeology, his, contemporary, ouyang, xiu, 1007, 1072, compiled, an, analytical, catalogue, of, ancient, rubbings, on, stone, and, bronze, which, pioneered, ideas, in, early, epigraphy, and, archaeology, during, the, 11th, century, song, scholars, discovered, the, ancient, shrine, of, wu, liang, 78, 151, ce, a, scholar, of, the, han, dynasty, they, produced, rubbings, of, the, carvings, and, bas, reliefs, decorating, the, walls, of, his, tomb, so, that, they, could, be, analyzed, elsewhere, on, the, unreliability, of, historical, works, written, after, the, fact, the, epigrapher, and, poet, zhao, mingcheng, 1081, 1129, stated, the, inscriptions, on, stone, and, bronze, are, made, at, the, time, the, events, took, place, and, can, be, trusted, without, reservation, and, thus, discrepancies, may, be, discovered, historian, r, c, rudolph, states, that, zhao, s, emphasis, on, consulting, contemporary, sources, for, accurate, dating, is, parallel, with, the, concern, of, the, german, historian, leopold, von, ranke, 1795, 1886, and, was, in, fact, emphasized, by, many, song, scholars, the, song, scholar, hong, mai, 1123, 1202, heavily, criticized, what, he, called, the, court, s, ridiculous, archaeological, catalogue, bogutu, compiled, during, the, huizong, reign, periods, of, zheng, he, and, xuan, he, 1111, 1125, hong, mai, obtained, old, vessels, from, the, han, dynasty, and, compared, them, with, the, descriptions, offered, in, the, catalogue, which, he, found, so, inaccurate, he, stated, he, had, to, hold, my, sides, with, laughter, hong, mai, pointed, out, that, the, erroneous, material, was, the, fault, of, chancellor, cai, jing, who, prohibited, scholars, from, reading, and, consulting, written, histories
