https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_South_America
the, history, of, south, america, is, the, study, of, the, past, particularly, the, written, record, oral, histories, and, traditions, passed, down, from, generation, to, generation, on, the, continent, of, south, america, the, continent, continues, to, be, home, to, indigenous, peoples, some, of, whom, built, high, civilizations, prior, to, the, arrival, of, europeans, in, the, late, 1400s, and, early, 1500s, south, america, has, a, history, that, has, a, wide, range, of, human, cultures, and, forms, of, civilization, the, caral, supe, civilization, also, known, as, the, norte, chico, civilization, in, peru, is, the, oldest, civilization, in, the, americas, and, one, of, the, first, six, independent, civilizations, in, the, world, it, was, contemporaneous, with, the, egyptian, pyramids, it, predated, the, mesoamerican, olmec, by, nearly, two, millennia, indigenous, peoples, thousands, of, years, of, independent, life, were, disrupted, by, european, colonization, from, spain, and, portugal, and, by, demographic, collapse, the, resulting, civilizations, however, were, very, different, from, those, of, their, colonizers, both, in, the, mestizos, and, the, indigenous, cultures, of, the, continent, through, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, south, america, especially, brazil, became, the, home, of, millions, of, people, of, the, african, diaspora, the, mixing, of, ethnic, groups, led, to, new, social, structures, the, tensions, between, europeans, indigenous, peoples, and, african, slaves, and, their, descendants, shaped, south, america, starting, in, the, sixteenth, century, most, of, spanish, america, achieved, its, independence, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, through, hard, fought, wars, while, portuguese, brazil, first, became, the, seat, of, the, portuguese, empire, and, then, an, empire, independent, of, portugal, with, the, revolution, for, independence, from, the, spanish, crown, achieved, during, the, 19th, century, south, america, underwent, yet, more, social, and, political, changes, these, have, included, nation, building, projects, absorbing, waves, of, immigration, from, europe, in, the, late, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, dealing, with, increased, international, trade, colonization, of, hinterlands, and, wars, about, territory, ownership, and, power, balance, during, this, period, there, has, also, been, the, reorganization, of, indigenous, rights, and, duties, subjugation, of, indigenous, peoples, living, in, the, states, frontiers, that, lasted, until, the, early, 1900s, liberal, conservative, conflicts, among, the, ruling, classes, and, major, demographic, and, environmental, changes, accompanying, the, development, of, sensitive, habitats, in, the, paleozoic, and, early, mesozoic, eras, south, america, and, africa, were, connected, in, a, landmass, called, gondwana, as, part, of, the, supercontinent, pangaea, in, the, albian, around, 110, mya, south, america, and, africa, began, to, diverge, along, the, southern, mid, atlantic, ridge, giving, rise, to, a, landmass, of, antarctica, and, south, america, during, the, late, eocene, around, 35, mya, antarctica, and, south, america, separated, and, south, america, became, a, massive, biologically, rich, island, continent, during, approximately, 30, million, years, the, biodiversity, of, south, america, was, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, world, leading, to, the, evolution, of, species, within, the, continent, the, event, that, caused, the, mass, extinction, of, dinosaurs, 66, mya, gave, rise, to, neotropical, rainforest, biomes, like, the, amazonia, replacing, species, composition, and, structure, of, local, forests, during, 6, million, years, of, recovery, to, former, levels, of, plant, diversity, they, evolved, from, widely, spaced, gymnosperm, dominated, forests, to, the, forests, with, thick, canopies, which, block, sunlight, prevalent, flowering, plants, and, high, vertical, layering, as, known, today, geological, evidence, suggests, that, approximately, 3, million, years, ago, south, america, became, connected, to, north, america, when, the, bolivar, trough, marine, barrier, disappeared, and, the, panamanian, land, bridge, formed, the, joining, of, these, two, land, masses, led, to, the, great, american, interchange, in, which, biota, from, both, continents, expanded, their, ranges, the, first, species, known, to, have, made, the, northward, migration, was, pliometanastes, a, fossil, ground, sloth, roughly, the, size, of, a, modern, black, bear, migrations, to, the, southern, hemisphere, were, undertaken, by, several, north, american, mammalian, carnivores, fewer, species, migrated, in, the, opposite, direction, from, south, to, north, the, result, of, the, expansion, of, a, north, american, fauna, was, a, mass, extinction, in, which, hundreds, of, species, disappeared, in, a, relatively, short, time, about, 60, of, present, day, south, american, mammals, have, evolved, from, north, american, species, some, south, american, species, were, able, to, adapt, and, spread, into, north, america, apart, from, pliometanastes, during, the, irvingtonian, stage, of, the, mammal, land, stages, around, 1, 9, mya, species, as, pampatherium, a, giant, armadillo, ground, sloth, megatherium, giant, anteater, myrmecophaga, a, neogene, capybara, hydrochoerus, meizonyx, opossum, didelphis, and, mixotoxodon, followed, the, route, north, the, terror, bird, titanis, the, only, large, carnivore, in, south, american, dispersed, into, north, america, the, americas, are, thought, to, have, been, first, inhabited, by, people, from, eastern, asia, who, crossed, the, bering, land, bridge, to, present, day, alaska, the, land, separated, and, the, continents, are, divided, by, the, bering, strait, over, the, course, of, millennia, three, waves, of, migrants, spread, to, all, parts, of, the, americas, genetic, and, linguistic, evidence, has, shown, that, the, last, wave, of, migrant, peoples, settled, across, the, northern, tier, and, did, not, reach, south, america, amongst, the, oldest, evidence, for, human, presence, in, south, america, is, the, monte, verde, ii, site, in, chile, suggested, to, date, to, around, 14, 500, years, ago, from, around, 13, 000, years, ago, the, fishtail, projectile, point, style, became, widespread, across, south, america, with, its, disppearance, around, 11, 000, years, ago, coincident, with, the, disappearance, of, south, america, s, megafauna, as, part, of, the, quaternary, extinction, event, the, first, evidence, for, the, existence, of, agricultural, practices, in, south, america, dates, back, to, circa, 6500, bce, when, potatoes, chilies, and, beans, began, to, be, cultivated, for, food, in, the, amazon, basin, pottery, evidence, suggests, that, manioc, which, remains, a, staple, food, supply, today, was, being, cultivated, as, early, as, 2000, bce, south, american, cultures, began, domesticating, llamas, and, alpacas, in, the, highlands, of, the, andes, circa, 3500, bce, these, animals, were, used, for, both, transportation, and, meat, their, fur, was, shorn, or, collected, to, use, to, make, clothing, guinea, pigs, were, also, domesticated, as, a, food, source, at, this, time, by, 2000, bce, many, agrarian, village, communities, had, developed, throughout, the, andes, and, the, surrounding, regions, fishing, became, a, widespread, practice, along, the, coast, with, fish, being, the, primary, source, of, food, for, those, communities, irrigation, systems, were, also, developed, at, this, time, which, aided, in, the, rise, of, agrarian, societies, the, food, crops, were, quinoa, corn, lima, beans, common, beans, peanuts, manioc, sweet, potatoes, potatoes, oca, and, squashes, cotton, was, also, grown, and, was, particularly, important, as, the, only, major, fiber, crop, among, the, earliest, permanent, settlements, dated, to, 4700, bc, is, the, huaca, prieta, site, on, the, coast, of, peru, and, at, 3500, bc, the, valdivia, culture, in, ecuador, other, groups, also, formed, permanent, settlements, among, those, groups, were, the, muisca, or, muysca, and, the, tairona, located, in, present, day, colombia, the, ca, ari, of, ecuador, quechua, of, peru, and, aymara, of, bolivia, were, the, three, most, important, native, peoples, who, developed, societies, of, sedentary, agriculture, in, south, america, in, the, last, two, thousand, years, there, may, have, been, contact, with, the, polynesians, who, sailed, to, and, from, the, continent, across, the, south, pacific, ocean, the, sweet, potato, which, originated, in, south, america, spread, through, some, areas, of, the, pacific, there, is, no, genetic, legacy, of, human, contact, on, the, north, western, coast, of, present, day, peru, the, caral, supe, civilization, also, known, as, the, norte, chico, civilization, emerged, as, one, of, six, civilizations, to, develop, independently, in, the, world, it, was, roughly, contemporaneous, with, the, egyptian, pyramids, it, preceded, the, civilization, of, mesoamerica, by, two, millennia, it, is, believed, to, have, been, the, only, civilization, dependent, on, fishing, rather, than, agriculture, to, support, its, population, the, caral, supe, complex, is, one, of, the, larger, norte, chico, sites, and, has, been, dated, to, 27th, century, bce, it, is, noteworthy, for, having, absolutely, no, signs, of, warfare, it, was, contemporary, with, urbanism, s, rise, in, mesopotamia, the, ca, ari, were, the, indigenous, natives, of, today, s, ecuadorian, provinces, of, ca, ar, and, azuay, at, the, time, of, european, contact, they, were, an, elaborate, civilization, with, advanced, architecture, and, religious, belief, most, of, their, remains, were, either, burned, or, destroyed, from, attacks, by, the, inca, and, later, the, spaniards, their, old, city, guapondelig, was, replaced, twice, first, by, the, incan, city, of, tomipamba, and, later, by, the, colonial, city, of, cuenca, the, city, was, believed, by, the, spanish, to, be, the, site, of, el, dorado, the, city, of, gold, from, the, mythology, of, colombia, the, ca, ari, were, most, notable, in, having, repulsed, the, incan, invasion, with, fierce, resistance, for, many, years, until, they, fell, to, tupac, yupanqui, it, is, said, that, the, inca, strategically, married, the, ca, ari, princess, paccha, to, conquer, the, people, many, of, their, descendants, still, reside, in, ca, ar, the, chibcha, speaking, communities, were, the, most, numerous, the, most, extended, by, territory, and, the, most, socio, economically, developed, of, the, pre, hispanic, colombian, cultures, they, were, divided, into, two, linguistic, subgroups, the, arwako, chimila, languages, with, the, tairona, kankuamo, kogi, arhuaco, chimila, and, chitarero, people, and, the, kuna, colombian, languages, with, kuna, nutabe, motilon, u, wa, lache, guane, sutagao, and, muisca, of, these, indigenous, groups, the, muisca, were, the, most, advanced, and, formed, one, of, the, four, grand, civilisations, in, the, americas, with, the, inca, in, peru, they, constituted, the, two, developed, and, specialised, societies, of, south, america, the, muisca, meaning, people, or, person, in, their, version, of, the, chibcha, language, muysccubun, inhabited, the, altiplano, cundiboyacense, the, high, plateau, in, the, eastern, ranges, of, the, colombian, andes, and, surrounding, valleys, such, as, the, tenza, valley, commonly, set, at, 800, ad, their, history, succeeded, the, herrera, period, the, people, were, organised, in, a, loose, confederation, of, rulers, later, called, the, muisca, confederation, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, conquest, their, reign, spread, across, the, modern, departments, cundinamarca, and, boyac, with, small, parts, of, southern, santander, with, a, surface, area, of, approximately, 25, 000, square, kilometres, 9, 700, sq, mi, and, a, total, population, of, between, 300, 000, and, two, million, individuals, the, muisca, were, known, as, the, salt, people, thanks, to, their, extraction, of, and, trade, in, halite, from, brines, in, various, salt, mines, of, which, those, in, zipaquir, and, nemoc, n, are, still, the, most, important, this, extraction, process, was, the, work, of, the, muisca, women, exclusively, and, formed, the, backbone, of, their, highly, regarded, trading, with, other, chibcha, arawak, and, cariban, speaking, neighboring, indigenous, groups, trading, was, performed, using, salt, small, cotton, cloths, and, larger, mantles, and, ceramics, as, barter, trade, their, economy, was, agricultural, in, nature, profiting, from, the, fertile, soils, of, the, pleistocene, lake, humboldt, that, existed, on, the, bogot, savanna, until, around, 30, 000, years, bp, their, crops, were, cultivated, using, irrigation, and, drainage, on, elevated, terraces, and, mounds, to, the, spanish, conquistadors, they, were, best, known, for, their, advanced, gold, working, as, represented, in, the, tunjos, votive, offer, pieces, spread, in, museum, collections, all, around, the, world, the, famous, muisca, raft, centerpiece, in, the, collection, of, the, museo, del, oro, in, the, colombian, capital, bogot, shows, the, skilled, goldworking, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, altiplano, the, muisca, were, the, only, pre, columbian, civilization, known, in, south, america, to, have, used, coins, tejuelos, the, gold, and, tumbaga, a, gold, silver, copper, alloy, elaborated, by, the, muisca, created, the, legend, of, el, dorado, the, land, city, or, man, of, gold, the, spanish, conquistadors, who, landed, in, the, caribbean, city, of, santa, marta, were, informed, of, the, rich, gold, culture, and, led, by, gonzalo, jim, nez, de, quesada, and, his, brother, hern, n, p, rez, organised, the, most, strenuous, of, the, spanish, conquests, into, the, heart, of, the, andes, in, april, 1536, after, an, expedition, of, a, year, where, 80, of, the, soldiers, died, due, to, the, harsh, climate, carnivores, such, as, caimans, and, jaguars, and, the, frequent, attacks, of, the, indigenous, peoples, found, along, the, route, tisquesusa, the, zipa, of, bacat, on, the, bogot, savanna, was, beaten, by, the, spanish, on, april, 20, 1537, and, died, bathing, in, his, own, blood, as, prophesied, by, the, mohan, pop, n, for, a, long, time, scholars, believed, that, amazon, forests, were, occupied, by, small, numbers, of, hunter, gatherer, tribes, archeologist, betty, j, meggers, was, a, prominent, proponent, of, this, idea, as, described, in, her, book, amazonia, man, and, culture, in, a, counterfeit, paradise, however, recent, archeological, findings, have, suggested, that, the, region, was, densely, populated, from, the, 1970s, numerous, geoglyphs, have, been, discovered, on, deforested, land, dating, between, 0, 1250, ad, additional, finds, have, led, to, conclusions, that, there, were, highly, developed, and, populous, cultures, in, the, forests, organized, as, pre, columbian, civilizations, the, bbc, s, unnatural, histories, claimed, that, the, amazon, rainforest, rather, than, being, a, pristine, wilderness, has, been, shaped, by, man, for, at, least, 11, 000, years, through, practices, such, as, forest, gardening, the, discovery, of, the, upano, valley, sites, in, present, day, eastern, ecuador, predate, all, known, complex, amazonian, societies, the, first, european, to, travel, the, length, of, the, amazon, river, was, francisco, de, orellana, in, 1542, the, bbc, documentary, unnatural, histories, presents, evidence, that, francisco, de, orellana, rather, than, exaggerating, his, claims, as, previously, thought, was, correct, in, his, observations, that, an, advanced, civilization, was, flourishing, along, the, amazon, in, the, 1540s, it, is, believed, that, the, civilization, was, later, devastated, by, the, spread, of, infectious, diseases, from, europe, such, as, smallpox, to, which, the, natives, had, no, immunity, some, 5, million, people, may, have, lived, in, the, amazon, region, in, 1500, divided, between, dense, coastal, settlements, such, as, that, at, maraj, and, inland, dwellers, by, 1900, the, population, had, fallen, to, 1, million, and, by, the, early, 1980s, it, was, less, than, 200, 000, researchers, have, found, that, the, fertile, terra, preta, black, earth, is, distributed, over, large, areas, in, the, amazon, forest, it, is, now, widely, accepted, that, these, soils, are, a, product, of, indigenous, soil, management, the, development, of, this, soil, enabled, agriculture, and, silviculture, to, be, conducted, in, the, previously, hostile, environment, large, portions, of, the, amazon, rainforest, are, therefore, probably, the, result, of, centuries, of, human, management, rather, than, naturally, occurring, as, has, previously, been, supposed, in, the, region, of, the, xinguanos, tribe, remains, of, some, of, these, large, mid, forest, amazon, settlements, were, found, in, 2003, by, michael, heckenberger, and, colleagues, of, the, university, of, florida, among, those, remains, were, evidence, of, constructed, roads, bridges, and, large, plazas, the, chav, n, a, south, american, preliterate, civilization, established, a, trade, network, and, developed, agriculture, by, 900, bce, according, to, some, estimates, and, archeological, finds, artifacts, were, found, at, a, site, called, chav, n, de, huantar, in, modern, peru, at, an, elevation, of, 3, 177, meters, chav, n, civilization, spanned, 900, to, 200, bce, the, moche, thrived, on, the, north, coast, of, peru, between, the, first, and, ninth, century, ce, the, heritage, of, the, moche, comes, down, to, us, through, their, elaborate, burials, excavated, by, former, ucla, professor, christopher, b, donnan, in, association, with, the, national, geographic, society, skilled, artisans, the, moche, were, a, technologically, advanced, people, who, traded, with, faraway, peoples, like, the, maya, knowledge, about, the, moche, has, been, derived, mostly, from, their, ceramic, pottery, which, is, carved, with, representations, of, their, daily, lives, they, practiced, human, sacrifice, had, blood, drinking, rituals, and, their, religion, incorporated, non, procreative, sexual, practices, such, as, fellatio, holding, their, capital, at, the, great, puma, shaped, city, of, cuzco, the, inca, civilization, dominated, the, andes, region, from, 1438, to, 1533, known, as, tawantin, suyu, or, the, land, of, the, four, regions, in, quechua, the, inca, civilization, was, highly, distinct, and, developed, inca, rule, extended, to, nearly, a, hundred, linguistic, or, ethnic, communities, some, 9, to, 14, million, people, connected, by, a, 25, 000, kilometre, road, system, cities, were, built, with, precise, unmatched, stonework, constructed, over, many, levels, of, mountain, terrain, terrace, farming, was, a, useful, form, of, agriculture, there, is, evidence, of, excellent, metalwork, and, successful, skull, surgery, in, inca, civilization, the, inca, had, no, written, language, but, used, quipu, a, system, of, knotted, strings, to, record, information, ongoing, kiphu, research, suggests, that, the, inca, used, a, phonetic, system, as, a, form, of, writing, in, the, kiphu, the, arawak, lived, along, the, eastern, coast, of, south, america, from, present, day, guyana, to, as, far, south, as, what, is, now, brazil, explorer, christopher, columbus, described, them, at, first, encounter, as, a, peaceful, people, having, already, dominated, other, local, groups, such, as, the, ciboney, the, arawak, had, however, come, under, increasing, military, pressure, from, the, carib, who, are, believed, to, have, left, the, orinoco, river, area, to, settle, on, islands, and, the, coast, of, the, caribbean, sea, over, the, century, leading, up, to, columbus, arrival, in, the, caribbean, archipelago, in, 1492, the, carib, are, believed, to, have, displaced, many, of, the, arawak, who, previously, settled, the, island, chains, the, carib, also, encroached, on, arawak, territory, in, what, is, modern, guyana, the, carib, were, skilled, boatbuilders, and, sailors, who, owed, their, dominance, in, the, caribbean, basin, to, their, military, skills, the, carib, war, rituals, included, cannibalism, they, had, a, practice, of, taking, home, the, limbs, of, victims, as, trophies, it, is, not, known, how, many, indigenous, peoples, lived, in, venezuela, and, colombia, before, the, spanish, conquest, it, may, have, been, approximately, one, million, including, groups, such, as, the, auak, caquetio, mariche, and, timoto, cuicas, the, number, of, people, fell, dramatically, after, the, conquest, mainly, due, to, high, mortality, rates, in, epidemics, of, infectious, eurasian, diseases, introduced, by, the, explorers, who, carried, them, as, an, endemic, disease, there, were, two, main, north, south, axes, of, pre, columbian, population, producing, maize, in, the, west, and, manioc, in, the, east, large, parts, of, the, llanos, plains, were, cultivated, through, a, combination, of, slash, and, burn, and, permanent, settled, agriculture, before, the, arrival, of, europeans, 20, 30, million, people, lived, in, south, america, between, 1452, and, 1493, a, series, of, papal, bulls, dum, diversas, romanus, pontifex, and, inter, caetera, paved, the, way, for, the, european, colonization, and, catholic, missions, in, the, new, world, these, authorized, the, european, christian, nations, to, take, possession, of, non, christian, lands, and, encouraged, subduing, and, converting, the, non, christian, people, of, africa, and, the, americas, in, 1494, portugal, and, spain, the, two, great, maritime, powers, of, that, time, signed, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, in, the, expectation, of, new, lands, being, discovered, in, the, west, through, the, treaty, they, agreed, that, all, the, land, outside, europe, should, be, an, exclusive, duopoly, between, the, two, countries, the, treaty, established, an, imaginary, line, along, a, north, south, meridian, 370, leagues, west, of, cape, verde, islands, roughly, 46, 37, w, in, terms, of, the, treaty, all, land, to, the, west, of, the, line, which, is, now, known, to, include, most, of, the, south, american, soil, would, belong, to, spain, and, all, land, to, the, east, to, portugal, because, accurate, measurements, of, longitude, were, not, possible, at, that, time, the, line, was, not, strictly, enforced, resulting, in, a, portuguese, expansion, of, brazil, across, the, meridian, in, 1498, during, his, third, voyage, to, the, americas, christopher, columbus, sailed, near, the, orinoco, delta, and, then, landed, in, the, gulf, of, paria, in, what, is, now, venezuela, amazed, by, the, great, offshore, current, of, freshwater, which, deflected, his, course, eastward, columbus, stated, in, his, letter, to, isabella, i, and, ferdinand, ii, that, he, must, have, reached, heaven, on, earth, terrestrial, paradise, great, signs, are, these, of, the, terrestrial, paradise, for, the, site, conforms, to, the, opinion, of, the, holy, and, wise, theologians, whom, i, have, mentioned, and, likewise, the, signs, conform, very, well, for, i, have, never, read, or, heard, of, such, a, large, quantity, of, fresh, water, being, inside, and, in, such, close, proximity, to, salt, water, the, very, mild, temperateness, also, corroborates, this, and, if, the, water, of, which, i, speak, does, not, proceed, from, paradise, then, it, is, an, even, greater, marvel, because, i, do, not, believe, such, a, large, and, deep, river, has, ever, been, known, to, exist, in, this, world, beginning, in, 1499, the, people, and, natural, resources, of, south, america, were, repeatedly, exploited, by, foreign, conquistadors, first, from, spain, and, later, from, portugal, these, competing, colonial, nations, claimed, the, land, and, resources, as, their, own, and, divided, it, into, colonies, european, diseases, smallpox, influenza, measles, and, typhus, to, which, the, native, populations, had, no, resistance, were, the, overwhelming, cause, of, the, depopulation, of, the, native, american, population, systems, of, forced, labor, such, as, encomiendas, and, mining, industries, mita, under, spanish, control, also, contributed, to, depopulation, lower, bound, estimates, speak, of, a, decline, in, the, population, of, around, 20, 50, percent, whereas, the, highest, estimates, reach, 90, percent, following, this, enslaved, africans, who, had, developed, immunity, to, these, diseases, were, quickly, brought, in, to, replace, them, the, spaniards, were, committed, to, converting, their, american, subjects, to, christianity, and, were, quick, to, purge, any, native, cultural, practices, that, hindered, this, end, however, most, initial, attempts, at, this, were, only, partially, successful, american, groups, simply, blended, catholicism, with, their, traditional, beliefs, the, spaniards, did, not, impose, their, language, to, the, degree, they, did, their, religion, in, fact, the, missionary, work, of, the, roman, catholic, church, in, quechua, nahuatl, and, guarani, actually, contributed, to, the, expansion, of, these, american, languages, equipping, them, with, writing, systems, eventually, the, natives, and, the, spaniards, interbred, forming, a, mestizo, class, mestizos, and, the, native, americans, were, often, forced, to, pay, unfair, taxes, to, the, spanish, government, although, all, subjects, paid, taxes, and, were, punished, harshly, for, disobeying, their, laws, many, native, artworks, were,

powers, a, few, countries, did, not, gain, independence, until, the, 20th, century, french, guiana, remains, an, overseas, department, of, france, by, the, start, of, the, century, the, united, states, continued, its, interventionist, attitude, which, aimed, to, directly, defend, its, interests, in, the, region, this, was, officially, articulated, in, theodore, roosevelt, s, big, stick, doctrine, which, modified, the, old, monroe, doctrine, which, had, simply, aimed, to, deter, european, intervention, in, the, hemisphere, the, great, depression, posed, a, challenge, to, the, region, the, collapse, of, the, world, economy, meant, that, the, demand, for, raw, materials, drastically, declined, undermining, many, of, the, economies, of, south, america, intellectuals, and, government, leaders, in, south, america, turned, their, backs, on, the, older, economic, policies, and, turned, toward, import, substitution, industrialization, the, goal, was, to, create, self, sufficient, economies, which, would, have, their, own, industrial, sectors, and, large, middle, classes, and, which, would, be, immune, to, the, ups, and, downs, of, the, global, economy, despite, the, potential, threats, to, united, states, commercial, interests, the, roosevelt, administration, 1933, 1945, understood, that, the, united, states, could, not, wholly, oppose, import, substitution, roosevelt, implemented, a, good, neighbor, policy, and, allowed, the, nationalization, of, some, american, companies, in, south, america, the, second, world, war, also, brought, the, united, states, and, most, latin, american, nations, together, the, history, of, south, america, during, world, war, ii, is, important, because, of, the, significant, economic, political, and, military, changes, that, occurred, throughout, much, of, the, region, as, a, result, of, the, war, in, order, to, better, protect, the, panama, canal, combat, axis, influence, and, optimize, the, production, of, goods, for, the, war, effort, the, united, states, through, lend, lease, and, similar, programs, greatly, expanded, its, interests, in, latin, america, resulting, in, large, scale, modernization, and, a, major, economic, boost, for, the, countries, that, participated, strategically, brazil, was, of, great, importance, because, of, its, having, the, closest, point, in, the, americas, to, africa, where, the, allies, were, actively, engaged, in, fighting, the, germans, and, italians, for, the, axis, the, southern, cone, nations, of, argentina, and, chile, were, where, they, found, most, of, their, south, american, support, and, they, utilised, it, to, the, fullest, by, interfering, with, internal, affairs, conducting, espionage, and, distributing, propaganda, brazil, was, the, only, country, to, send, an, expeditionary, force, to, the, european, theatre, however, several, countries, had, skirmishes, with, german, u, boats, and, cruisers, in, the, caribbean, and, south, atlantic, mexico, sent, a, fighter, squadron, of, 300, volunteers, to, the, pacific, the, escuadr, n, 201, were, known, as, the, aztec, eagles, aguilas, aztecas, the, brazilian, active, participation, on, the, battle, field, in, europe, was, divined, after, the, casablanca, conference, the, president, of, the, u, s, franklin, d, roosevelt, on, his, way, back, from, morocco, met, the, president, of, brazil, getulio, vargas, in, natal, rio, grande, do, norte, this, meeting, is, known, as, the, potenji, river, conference, and, defined, the, creation, of, the, brazilian, expeditionary, force, according, to, author, thomas, m, leonard, world, war, ii, had, a, major, impact, on, latin, american, economies, following, the, december, 7, 1941, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, most, of, latin, america, either, severed, relations, with, the, axis, powers, or, declared, war, on, them, as, a, result, many, nations, including, all, of, central, america, the, dominican, republic, mexico, chile, peru, argentina, and, venezuela, suddenly, found, that, they, were, now, dependent, on, the, united, states, for, trade, the, united, states, high, demand, for, particular, products, and, commodities, during, the, war, further, distorted, trade, for, example, the, united, states, wanted, all, of, the, platinum, produced, in, colombia, all, the, silver, of, chile, and, all, of, cotton, gold, and, copper, of, peru, the, parties, agreed, upon, set, prices, often, with, a, high, premium, but, the, various, nations, lost, their, ability, to, bargain, and, trade, in, the, open, market, wars, became, less, frequent, in, the, 20th, century, with, bolivia, paraguay, and, peru, ecuador, fighting, the, last, inter, state, wars, early, in, the, 20th, century, the, three, wealthiest, south, american, countries, engaged, in, a, vastly, expensive, naval, arms, race, which, was, catalyzed, by, the, introduction, of, a, new, warship, type, the, dreadnought, at, one, point, the, argentine, government, was, spending, a, fifth, of, its, entire, yearly, budget, for, just, two, dreadnoughts, a, price, that, did, not, include, later, in, service, costs, which, for, the, brazilian, dreadnoughts, was, sixty, percent, of, the, initial, purchase, the, continent, became, a, battlefield, of, the, cold, war, in, the, late, 20th, century, some, democratically, elected, governments, of, argentina, brazil, chile, uruguay, and, paraguay, were, overthrown, or, displaced, by, military, dictatorships, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, to, curtail, opposition, their, governments, detained, tens, of, thousands, of,

communism, became, the, greatest, political, issue, for, both, the, united, states, and, governments, in, the, region, the, start, of, the, cold, war, forced, governments, to, choose, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, by, the, 1970s, leftists, had, acquired, a, significant, political, influence, which, prompted, the, right, wing, ecclesiastical, authorities, and, a, large, portion, of, each, individual, country, s, upper, class, to, support, coups, d, tat, to, avoid, what, they, perceived, as, a, communist, threat, this, was, further, fueled, by, cuban, and, united, states, intervention, which, led, to, a, political, polarisation, most, south, american, countries, were, in, some, periods, ruled, by, military, dictatorships, that, were, supported, by, the, united, states, of, america, also, around, the, 1970s, the, regimes, of, the, southern, cone, collaborated, in, operation, condor, killing, many, leftist, dissidents, including, some, urban, guerrillas, however, by, the, early, 1990s, all, countries, had, restored, their, democracies, colombia, has, had, an, ongoing, though, diminished, internal, conflict, which, started, in, 1964, with, the, creation, of, marxist, guerrillas, farc, ep, and, then, involved, several, illegal, armed, groups, of, leftist, leaning, ideology, as, well, as, the, private, armies, of, powerful, drug, lords, many,

is, widespread, now, nonetheless, allegations, of, corruption, are, still, very, common, and, several, countries, have, developed, crises, which, have, forced, the, resignation, of, their,

the, presence, of, a, number, of, latin, american, governments, which, profess, to, embrace, a, leftist, ideology, it, is, difficult, to, categorize, latin, american, states, according, to, dominant,
