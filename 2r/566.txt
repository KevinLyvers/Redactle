openness, known, as, the, khrushchev, thaw, however, the, subsequent, era, under, leonid, brezhnev, referred, to, as, the, era, of, stagnation, was, marked, by, economic, decline, political, corruption, and, a, rigid, gerontocracy, despite, efforts, to, maintain, the, soviet, union, s, superpower, status, the, economy, struggled, due, to, its, centralized, nature, technological, backwardness, and, inefficiencies, the, vast, military, expenditures, and, burdens, of, maintaining, the, eastern, bloc, further, strained, the, soviet, economy, in, the, 1980s, mikhail, gorbachev, s, policies, of, glasnost, openness, and, perestroika, restructuring, aimed, to, revitalize, the, soviet, system, but, instead, accelerated, its, unraveling, nationalist, movements, gained, momentum, across, the, soviet, republics, and, the, control, of, the, communist, party, weakened, the, failed, coup, attempt, in, august, 1991, against, gorbachev, by, hardline, communists, hastened, the, end, of, the, soviet, union, which, formally, dissolved, on, december, 26, 1991, ending, nearly, seven, decades, of, soviet, rule, with, an, area, of, 22, 402, 200, square, kilometres, 8, 649, 500, sq, mi,

environmental, problems, were, greater, than, what, the, soviet, authorities, admitted, the, soviet, union, was, the, world, s, second, largest, producer, of, harmful, emissions, in, 1988, total, emissions, in, the, soviet, union, were, about, 79, of, those, in, the, united, states, but, since, the, soviet, gnp, was, only, 54, of, that, of, the, united, states, this, means, that, the, soviet, union, generated, 1, 5, times, more, pollution, than, the, united, states, per, unit, of, gnp, the, soviet, chernobyl, disaster, in, 1986, was, the, first, major, accident, at, a, civilian, nuclear,

although, long, term, effects, of, the, accident, were, unknown, 4, 000, new, cases, of, thyroid, cancer, which, resulted, from, the, accident, s, contamination, were, reported, at, the, time, of, the, accident, but, this, led, to, a, relatively, low, number, of, deaths, who, data, 2005, another, major, radioactive, accident, was, the, kyshtym, disaster, the, kola, peninsula, was, one, of, the, places, with, major, problems, around, the, industrial, cities, of, monchegorsk, and, norilsk, where, nickel, for, example, is, mined, all, forests, have, been, destroyed, by, contamination, while, the, northern, and, other, parts, of, russia, have, been, affected, by, emissions, during, the, 1990s, people, in, the, west, were, also, interested, in, the, radioactive, hazards, of, nuclear, facilities, decommissioned, nuclear, submarines, and, the, processing, of, nuclear, waste, or, spent, nuclear, fuel, it, was, also, known, in, the, early, 1990s, that, the, ussr, had, transported,

soviet, union, cpsu, the, only, legal, party, and, the, final, policymaker, in, the, country, at, the, top, of, the, communist, party, was, the, central, committee, elected, at, party, congresses, and, conferences, in, turn, the, central, committee, voted, for, a, politburo, called, the, presidium, between, 1952, and, 1966, secretariat, and, the, general, secretary, first, secretary, from, 1953, to, 1966, the, de, facto, highest, office, in, the, soviet, union, depending, on, the, degree, of, power, consolidation, it, was, either, the, politburo, as, a, collective, body, or, the, general, secretary, who, always, was, one, of, the, politburo, members, that, effectively, led, the, party, and, the, country, except, for, the, period, of, the, highly, personalized, authority, of, stalin, exercised, directly, through, his, position, in, the, council, of, ministers, rather, than, the, politburo, after, 1941, they, were, not, controlled, by, the, general, party, membership, as, the, key, principle, of, the, party, organization, was, democratic, centralism, demanding, strict, subordination, to, higher, bodies, and, elections, went, uncontested, endorsing, the, candidates, proposed, from, above, the, communist, party, maintained, its, dominance, over, the, state, mainly, through, its, control, over, the, system, of, appointments, all, senior, government, officials, and, most, deputies, of, the, supreme, soviet, were, members, of, the, cpsu, of, the, party, heads, themselves, stalin, 1941, 1953, and, khrushchev, 1958, 1964, were, premiers, upon, the, forced, retirement, of, khrushchev, the, party, leader, was, prohibited, from, this, kind, of, double, membership, but, the, later, general, secretaries, for, at, least, some, part, of, their, tenure, occupied, the, mostly, ceremonial, position, of, chairman, of, the, presidium, of, the, supreme, soviet, the, nominal, head, of, state, the, institutions, at, lower, levels, were, overseen, and, at, times, supplanted, by, primary, party, organizations, however, in, practice, the, degree, of, control, the, party, was, able, to, exercise, over, the, state, bureaucracy, particularly, after, the, death, of, stalin, was, far, from, total, with, the, bureaucracy, pursuing, different, interests, that, were, at, times, in, conflict, with, the, party, nor, was, the, party, itself, monolithic, from, top, to, bottom, although, factions, were, officially, banned, the, supreme, soviet, successor, of, the, congress, of, soviets, was, nominally, the, highest, state, body, for, most, of, the, soviet, history, at, first, acting, as, a, rubber, stamp, institution, approving, and, implementing, all, decisions, made, by, the, party, however, its, powers, and, functions, were, extended, in, the, late, 1950s, 1960s, and, 1970s, including, the, creation, of, new, state, commissions, and, committees, it, gained, additional, powers, relating, to, the, approval, of, the, five, year, plans, and, the,

and, managing, an, enormous, bureaucracy, responsible, for, the, administration, of, the, economy, and, society, state, and, party, structures, of, the, constituent, republics, largely, emulated, the, structure, of, the, central, institutions, although, the, russian, sfsr, unlike, the, other, constituent, republics, for, most, of, its, history, had, no, republican, branch, of, the, cpsu, being, ruled, directly, by, the, union, wide, party, until, 1990, local, authorities, were, organized, likewise, into, party, committees, local, soviets, and, executive, committees, while, the, state,

instrumental, in, the, red, terror, and, great, purge, but, was, brought, under, strict, party, control, after, stalin, s, death, under, yuri, andropov, the, kgb, engaged, in, the, suppression, of, political, dissent, and, maintained, an, extensive, network, of, informers, reasserting, itself, as, a, political, actor, to, some, extent, independent, of, the, party, state, structure, culminating, in, the, anti, corruption, campaign, targeting, high, ranking, party, officials, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, the, constitution, which, was, promulgated, in, 1924, 1936, and, 1977, did,

power, struggles, took, place, in, the, politburo, after, the, deaths, of, lenin, and, stalin, as, well, as, after, khrushchev, s, dismissal, itself, due, to, a, decision, by, both, the, politburo, and, the, central, committee, all, leaders, of, the, communist, party, before, gorbachev, died, in, office, except, georgy, malenkov, and, khrushchev, both, dismissed, from, the, party, leadership, amid, internal, struggle, within, the, party, between, 1988, and, 1990, facing, considerable, opposition, mikhail, gorbachev, enacted, reforms, shifting, power, away, from, the, highest, bodies, of, the, party, and, making, the, supreme, soviet, less, dependent, on, them, the, congress, of, people, s, deputies, was, established, the, majority, of, whose, members, were, directly, elected, in,

conception, of, human, rights, was, very, different, from, international, law, according, to, soviet, legal, theory, it, is, the, government, who, is, the, beneficiary, of, human, rights, which, are, to, be, asserted, against, the, individual, the, soviet, state, was, considered, as, the, source, of, human, rights, therefore, the, soviet, legal, system, regarded, law, as, an, arm, of, politics, and, courts, as, agencies, of, the, government, extensive, extrajudicial, powers, were, given, to, the, soviet, secret, police, agencies, the, soviet, government, in, practice, significantly, curbed, the, rule, of, law, civil, liberties, protection, of, law, freedom, of, movement, and, guarantees, of, property, which, were, considered, as, examples, of, bourgeois, morality, by, soviet, law, theorists, such, as, andrey, vyshinsky, according, to, vladimir, lenin, the, purpose, of, socialist, courts, was, not, to, eliminate, terror, but, to, substantiate, it, and, legitimize, it, in, principle, the, soviet, union, signed, legally, binding, human, rights, documents, such, as, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, in, 1973, but, they, were, neither,

andrei, gromyko, 1909, 1989, intellectuals, were, based, in, the, moscow, state, institute, of, international, relations, the, marxist, leninist, leadership, of, the, soviet, union, intensely, debated, foreign, policy, issues, and, changed, directions, several, times, even, after, stalin, assumed, dictatorial, control, in, the, late, 1920s, there, were, debates, and, he, frequently, changed, positions, during, the, country, s, early, period, it, was, assumed, that, communist, revolutions, would, break, out, soon, in, every, major, industrial, country, and, it, was, the, russian, responsibility, to, assist, them, the, comintern, was, the, weapon, of, choice, a, few, revolutions, did, break, out, but, they, were, quickly, suppressed, the, longest, lasting, one, was, in, hungary, the, hungarian, soviet, republic, lasted, only, from, 21, march, 1919, to, 1, august, 1919, the, russian, bolsheviks, were, in, no, position, to, give, any, help, by, 1921, lenin, trotsky, and, stalin, realized, that, capitalism, had, stabilized, itself, in, europe, and, there, would, not, be, any, widespread, revolutions, anytime, soon, it, became, the, duty, of, the, russian, bolsheviks, to, protect, what, they, had, in, russia, and, avoid, military, confrontations, that, might, destroy, their, bridgehead, russia, was, now, a, pariah, state, along, with, germany, the, two, came, to, terms, in, 1922, with, the, treaty, of, rapallo, that, settled, long, standing, grievances, at, the, same, time, the, two, countries, secretly, set, up, training, programs, for, the, illegal, german, army, and, air, force, operations, at, hidden, camps, in, the, ussr, moscow, eventually, stopped, threatening, other, states, and, instead, worked, to, open, peaceful, relationships, in, terms, of, trade, and, diplomatic, recognition, the, united, kingdom, dismissed, the, warnings, of, winston, churchill, and, a, few, others, about, a, continuing, marxist, leninist, threat, and, opened, trade, relations, and, de, facto, diplomatic, recognition, in, 1922, there, was, hope, for, a, settlement, of, the, pre, war, tsarist, debts, but, it, was, repeatedly, postponed, formal, recognition, came, when, the, new, labour, party, came, to, power, in, 1924, all, the, other, countries, followed, suit, in, opening, trade, relations, henry, ford, opened, large, scale, business, relations, with, the, soviets, in, the, late, 1920s, hoping, that, it, would, lead, to, long, term, peace, finally, in, 1933, the, united, states, officially, recognized, the, ussr, a, decision, backed, by, the, public, opinion, and, especially, by, us, business, interests, that, expected, an, opening, of, a, new, profitable, market, in, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, stalin, ordered, marxist, leninist, parties, across, the, world, to, strongly, oppose, non, marxist, political, parties, labor, unions, or, other, organizations, on, the, left, which, they, labelled, social, fascists, in, the, usage, of, the, soviet, union, and, of, the, comintern, and, its, affiliated, parties, in, this, period, the, epithet, fascist, was, used, to, describe, capitalist, society, in, general, and, virtually, any, anti, soviet, or, anti, stalinist, activity, or, opinion, stalin, reversed, himself, in, 1934, with, the, popular, front, program, that, called, on, all, marxist, parties, to, join, with, all, anti, fascist, political, labor, and, organizational, forces, that, were, opposed, to, fascism, especially, of, the, nazi, variety, the, rapid, growth, of, power, in, nazi, germany, encouraged, both, paris, and, moscow, to, form, a, military, alliance, and, the, franco, soviet, treaty, of, mutual, assistance, was, signed, in, may, 1935, a, firm, believer, in, collective, security, stalin, s, foreign, minister, maxim, litvinov, worked, very, hard, to, form, a, closer, relationship, with, france, and, britain, in, 1939, half, a, year, after, the, munich, agreement, the, ussr, attempted, to, form, an, anti, nazi, alliance, with, france, and, britain, adolf, hitler, proposed, a, better, deal, which, would, give, the, ussr, control, over, much, of, eastern, europe, through, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, in, september, germany, invaded, poland, and, the, ussr, also, invaded, later, that, month, resulting, in, the, partition, of, poland, in, response, britain, and, france, declared, war, on, germany, marking, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, up, until, his, death, in, 1953, joseph, stalin, controlled, all, foreign, relations, of, the, soviet, union, during, the, interwar, period, despite, the, increasing, build, up, of, germany, s, war, machine, and, the, outbreak, of, the, second, sino, japanese, war, the, soviet, union, did, not, cooperate, with, any, other, nation, choosing, to, follow, its, own, path, however, after, operation, barbarossa, the, soviet, union, s, priorities, changed, despite, previous, conflict, with, the, united, kingdom, vyacheslav, molotov, dropped, his, post, war, border, demands, the, cold, war, was, a, period, of, geopolitical, tension, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, and, their, respective, allies, the, western, bloc, and, the, eastern, bloc, which, began, following, world, war, ii, in, 1945, the, term, cold, war, is, used, because, there, was, no, large, scale, fighting, directly, between, the, two, superpowers, but, they, each, supported, major, regional, conflicts, known, as, proxy, wars, the, conflict, was, based, around, the, ideological, and, geopolitical, struggle, for, global, influence, by, these, two, superpowers, following, their, temporary, alliance, and, victory, against, nazi, germany, in, 1945, aside, from, the, nuclear, arsenal, development, and, conventional, military, deployment, the, struggle, for, dominance, was, expressed, via, indirect, means, such, as, psychological, warfare, propaganda, campaigns, espionage, far, reaching, embargoes, rivalry, at, sports, events, and, technological, competitions, such, as, the, space, race, constitutionally, the, ussr, was, a, federation, of, constituent, union, republics, which, were, either, unitary, states, such, as, ukraine, or, byelorussia, ssrs, or, federations, such, as, russia, or, transcaucasia, sfsrs, all, four, being, the, founding, republics, who, signed, the, treaty, on, the, creation, of, the, ussr, in, december, 1922, in, 1924, during, the, national, delimitation, in, central, asia, uzbekistan, and, turkmenistan, were, formed, from, parts, of, russia, s, turkestan, assr, and, two, soviet, dependencies, the, khorezm, and, bukharan, psps, in, 1929, tajikistan, was, split, off, from, the, uzbekistan, ssr, with, the, constitution, of, 1936, the, transcaucasian, sfsr, was, dissolved, resulting, in, its, constituent, republics, of, armenia, georgia, and, azerbaijan, being, elevated, to, union, republics, while, kazakhstan, and, kirghizia, were, split, off, from, the, russian, sfsr, resulting, in, the, same, status, in, august, 1940, moldavia, was, formed, from, parts, of, ukraine, and, soviet, occupied, bessarabia, and, ukrainian, ssr, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, were, also, annexed, by, the, soviet, union, and, turned, into, ssrs, which, was, not, recognized, by, most, of, the, international, community, and, was, considered, an, illegal, occupation, after, the, soviet, invasion, of, finland, the, karelo, finnish, ssr, was, formed, on, annexed, territory, as, a, union, republic, in, march, 1940, and, then, incorporated, into, russia, as, the, karelian, assr, in, 1956, between, july, 1956, and, september, 1991, there, were, 15, union, republics, see, map, below, while, nominally, a, union, of, equals, in, practice, the, soviet, union, was, dominated, by, russians, the, domination, was, so, absolute, that, for, most, of, its, existence, the, country, was, commonly, but, incorrectly, referred, to, as, russia, while, the, russian, sfsr, was, technically, only, one, republic, within, the, larger, union, it, was, by, far, the, largest, both, in, terms, of, population, and, area, most, powerful, and, most, highly, developed, the, russian, sfsr, was, also, the, industrial, center, of, the, soviet, union, historian, matthew, white, wrote, that, it, was, an, open, secret, that, the, country, s, federal, structure, was, window, dressing, for, russian, dominance, for, that, reason, the, people, of, the, ussr, were, usually, called, russians, not, soviets, since, everyone, knew, who, really, ran, the, show, under, the, military, law, of, september, 1925, the, soviet, armed, forces, consisted, of, the, land, forces, the, air, force, the, navy, joint, state, political, directorate, ogpu, and, the, internal, troops, the, ogpu, later, became, independent, and, in, 1934, joined, the, nkvd, secret, police, and, so, its, internal, troops, were, under, the, joint, leadership, of, the, defense, and, internal, commissariats, after, world, war, ii, strategic, missile, forces, 1959, air, defense, forces, 1948, and, national, civil, defense, forces, 1970, were, formed, which, ranked, first, third, and, sixth, in, the, official, soviet, system, of, importance, ground, forces, were, second, air, force, fourth, and, navy, fifth, the, army, had, the, greatest, political, influence, in, 1989, there, served, two, million, soldiers, divided, between, 150, motorized, and, 52, armored, divisions, until, the, early, 1960s, the, soviet, navy, was, a, rather, small, military, branch, but, after, the, caribbean, crisis, under, the, leadership, of, sergei, gorshkov, it, expanded, significantly, it, became, known, for, battlecruisers, and, submarines, in, 1989, there, served, 500, 000, men, the, soviet, air, force, focused, on, a, fleet, of, strategic, bombers, and, during, war, situation, was, to, eradicate, enemy, infrastructure, and, nuclear, capacity, the, air, force, also, had, a, number, of, fighters, and, tactical, bombers, to, support, the, army, in, the, war, strategic, missile, forces, had, more, than, 1, 400, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, icbms, deployed, between, 28, bases, and, 300, command, centers, in, the, post, war, period, the, soviet, army, was, directly, involved, in, several, military, operations, abroad, these, included, the, suppression, of, the, uprising, in, east, germany, 1953, hungarian, revolution, 1956, and, the, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, 1968, the, soviet, union, also, participated, in, the, war, in, afghanistan, between, 1979, and, 1989, in, the, soviet, union, general, conscription, applied, meaning, all, able, bodied, males, aged, 18, and, older, were, drafted, in, the, armed, forces, the, soviet, union, adopted, a, command, economy, whereby, production, and, distribution, of, goods, were, centralized, and, directed, by, the, government, the, first, bolshevik, experience, with, a, command, economy, was, the, policy, of, war, communism, which, involved, the, nationalization, of, industry, centralized, distribution, of, output, coercive, or, forced, requisition, of, agricultural, production, and, attempts, to, eliminate, money, circulation, private, enterprises, and, free, trade, the, barrier, troops, were, also, used, to, enforce, bolshevik, control, over, food, supplies, in, areas, controlled, by, the, red, army, a, role, which, soon, earned, them, the, hatred, of, the, russian, civilian, population, after, the, severe, economic, collapse, lenin, replaced, war, communism, by, the, new, economic, policy, nep, in, 1921, legalizing, free, trade, and, private, ownership, of, small, businesses, the, economy, steadily, recovered, as, a, result, after, a, long, debate, among, the, members, of, the, politburo, about, the, course, of, economic, development, by, 1928, 1929, upon, gaining, control, of, the, country, stalin, abandoned, the, nep, and, pushed, for, full, central, planning, starting, forced, collectivization, of, agriculture, and, enacting, draconian, labor, legislation, resources, were, mobilized, for, rapid, industrialization, which, significantly, expanded, soviet, capacity, in, heavy, industry, and, capital, goods, during, the, 1930s, the, primary, motivation, for, industrialization, was, preparation, for, war, mostly, due, to, distrust, of, the, outside, capitalist, world, as, a, result, the, ussr, was, transformed, from, a, largely, agrarian, economy, into, a, great, industrial, power, leading, the, way, for, its, emergence, as, a, superpower, after, world, war, ii, the, war, caused, extensive, devastation, of, the, soviet, economy, and, infrastructure, which, required, massive, reconstruction, by, the, early, 1940s, the, soviet, economy, had, become, relatively, self, sufficient, for, most, of, the, period, until, the, creation, of, comecon, only, a, tiny, share, of, domestic, products, was, traded, internationally, after, the, creation, of, the, eastern, bloc, external, trade, rose, rapidly, however, the, influence, of, the, world, economy, on, the, ussr, was, limited, by, fixed, domestic, prices, and, a, state, monopoly, on, foreign, trade, grain, and, sophisticated, consumer, manufactures, became, major, import, articles, from, around, the, 1960s, during, the, arms, race, of, the, cold, war, the, soviet, economy, was, burdened, by, military, expenditures, heavily, lobbied, for, by, a, powerful, bureaucracy, dependent, on, the, arms, industry, at, the, same, time, the, ussr, became, the, largest, arms, exporter, to, the, third, world, a, portion, of, soviet, resources, during, the, cold, war, were, allocated, in, aid, to, the, soviet, aligned, states, the, soviet, union, s, military, budget, in, the, 1970s, was, gigantic, forming, 40, 60, of, the, entire, federal, budget, and, accounting, to, 15, of, the, ussr, s, gdp, 13, in, the, 1980s, from, the, 1930s, until, its, dissolution, in, late, 1991, the, way, the, soviet, economy, operated, remained, essentially, unchanged, the, economy, was, formally, directed, by, central, planning, carried, out, by, gosplan, and, organized, in, five, year, plans, however, in, practice, the, plans, were, highly, aggregated, and, provisional, subject, to, ad, hoc, intervention, by, superiors, all, critical, economic, decisions, were, taken, by, the, political, leadership, allocated, resources, and, plan, targets, were, usually, denominated, in, rubles, rather, than, in, physical, goods, credit, was, discouraged, but, widespread, the, final, allocation, of, output, was, achieved, through, relatively, decentralized, unplanned, contracting, although, in, theory, prices, were, legally, set, from, above, in, practice, they, were, often, negotiated, and, informal, horizontal, links, e, g, between, producer, factories, were, widespread, a, number, of, basic, services, were, state, funded, such, as, education, and, health, care, in, the, manufacturing, sector, heavy, industry, and, defence, were, prioritized, over, consumer, goods, consumer, goods, particularly, outside, large, cities, were, often, scarce, of, poor, quality, and, limited, variety, under, the, command, economy, consumers, had, almost, no, influence, on, production, and, the, changing, demands, of, a, population, with, growing, incomes, could, not, be, satisfied, by, supplies, at, rigidly, fixed, prices, a, massive, unplanned, second, economy, grew, up, at, low, levels, alongside, the, planned, one, providing, some, of, the, goods, and, services, that, the, planners, could, not, the, legalization, of, some, elements, of, the, decentralized, economy, was, attempted, with, the, reform, of, 1965, although, statistics, of, the, soviet, economy, are, notoriously, unreliable, and, its, economic, growth, difficult, to, estimate, precisely, by, most, accounts, the, economy, continued, to, expand, until, the, mid, 1980s, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, it, had, comparatively, high, growth, and, was, catching, up, to, the, west, however, after, 1970, the, growth, while, still, positive, steadily, declined, much, more, quickly, and, consistently, than, in, other, countries, despite, a, rapid, increase, in, the, capital, stock, the, rate, of, capital, increase, was, only, surpassed, by, japan, overall, the, growth, rate, of, per, capita, income, in, the, soviet, union, between, 1960, and, 1989, was, slightly, above, the, world, average, based, on, 102, countries, a, 1986, study, published, in, the, american, journal, of, public, health, claimed, that, citing, world, bank, data, the, soviet, model, provided, a, better, quality, of, life, and, human, development, than, market, economies, at, the, same, level, of, economic, development, in, most, cases, according, to, stanley, fischer, and, william, easterly, growth, could, have, been, faster, by, their, calculation, per, capita, income, in, 1989, should, have, been, twice, higher, than, it, was, considering, the, amount, of, investment, education, and, population, the, authors, attribute, this, poor, performance, to, the, low, productivity, of, capital, steven, rosefielde, states, that, the, standard, of, living, declined, due, to, stalin, s, despotism, while, there, was, a, brief, improvement, after, his, death, it, lapsed, into, stagnation, in, 1987, mikhail, gorbachev, attempted, to, reform, and, revitalize, the, economy, with, his, program, of, perestroika, his, policies, relaxed, state, control, over, enterprises, but, did, not, replace, it, by, market, incentives, resulting, in, a, sharp, decline, in, output, the, economy, already, suffering, from, reduced, petroleum, export, revenues, started, to, collapse, prices, were, still, fixed, and, the, property, was, still, largely, state, owned, until, after, the, country, s, dissolution, for, most, of, the, period, after, world, war, ii, until, its, collapse, soviet, gdp, ppp, was, the, second, largest, in, the, world, and, third, during, the, second, half, of, the, 1980s, although, on, a, per, capita, basis, it, was, behind, that, of, first, world, countries, compared, to, countries, with, similar, per, capita, gdp, in, 1928, the, soviet, union, experienced, significant, growth, in, 1990, the, country, had, a, human, development, index, of, 0, 920, placing, it, in, the, high, category, of, human, development, it, was, the, third, highest, in, the, eastern, bloc, behind, czechoslovakia, and, east, germany, and, the, 25th, in, the, world, of, 130, countries, the, need, for, fuel, declined, in, the, soviet, union, from, the, 1970s, to, the, 1980s, both, per, ruble, of, gross, social, product, and, per, ruble, of, industrial, product, at, the, start, this, decline, grew, very, rapidly, but, gradually, slowed, down, between, 1970, and, 1975, from, 1975, and, 1980, it, grew, even, slower, only, 2, 6, david, wilson, a, historian, believed, that, the, gas, industry, would, account, for, 40, of, soviet, fuel, production, by, the, end, of, the, century, his, theory, did, not, come, to, fruition, because, of, the, ussr, s, collapse, the, ussr, in, theory, would, have, continued, to, have, an, economic, growth, rate, of, 2, 2, 5, during, the, 1990s, because, of, soviet, energy, fields, however, the, energy, sector, faced, many, difficulties, among, them, the, country, s, high, military, expenditure, and, hostile, relations, with, the, first, world, in, 1991, the, soviet, union, had, a, pipeline, network, of, 82, 000, kilometres, 51, 000, mi, for, crude, oil, and, another, 206, 500, kilometres, 128, 300, mi, for, natural, gas, petroleum, and, petroleum, based, products, natural, gas, metals, wood, agricultural, products, and, a, variety, of, manufactured, goods, primarily, machinery, arms, and, military, equipment, were, exported, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, ussr, heavily, relied, on, fossil, fuel, exports, to, earn, hard, currency, at, its, peak, in, 1988, it, was, the, largest, producer, and, second, largest, exporter, of, crude, oil, surpassed, only, by, saudi, arabia, the, soviet, union, placed, great, emphasis, on, science, and, technology, within, its, economy, however, the, most, remarkable, soviet, successes, in, technology, such, as, producing, the, world, s, first, space, satellite, typically, were, the, responsibility, of, the, military, lenin, believed, that, the, ussr, would, never, overtake, the, developed, world, if, it, remained, as, technologically, backward, as, it, was, upon, its, founding, soviet, authorities, proved, their, commitment, to, lenin, s, belief, by, developing, massive, networks, research, and, development, organizations, in, the, early, 1960s, the, soviets, awarded, 40, of, chemistry, phds, to, women, compared, to, only, 5, in, the, united, states, by, 1989, soviet, scientists, were, among, the, world, s, best, trained, specialists, in, several, areas, such, as, energy, physics, selected, areas, of, medicine, mathematics, welding, and, military, technologies, due, to, rigid, state, planning, and, bureaucracy, the, soviets, remained, far, behind, technologically, in, chemistry, biology, and, computers, when, compared, to, the, first, world, the, soviet, government, opposed, and, persecuted, geneticists, in, favour, of, lysenkoism, a, pseudoscience, rejected, by, the, scientific, community, in, the, soviet, union, and, abroad, but, supported, by, stalin, s, inner, circles, implemented, in, the, ussr, and, china, it, resulted, in, reduced, crop, yields, and, is, widely, believed, to, have, contributed, to, the, great, chinese, famine, the, soviet, union, also, had, more, scientists, and, engineers, relative, to, the, world, population, than, any, other, major, country, due, to, the, strong, levels, of, state, support, for, scientific, developments, by, the, 1980s, under, the, reagan, administration, project, socrates, determined, that, the, soviet, union, addressed, the, acquisition, of, science, and, technology, in, a, manner, that, was, radically, different, from, what, the, us, was, using, in, the, case, of, the, us, economic, prioritization, was, being, used, for, indigenous, research, and, development, as, the, means, to, acquire, science, and, technology, in, both, the, private, and, public, sectors, in, contrast, the, ussr, was, offensively, and, defensively, maneuvering, in, the, acquisition, and, use, of, the, worldwide, technology, to, increase, the, competitive, advantage, that, they, acquired, from, the, technology, while, preventing, the, us, from, acquiring, a, competitive, advantage, however, technology, based, planning, was, executed, in, a, centralized, government, centric, manner, that, greatly, hindered, its, flexibility, this, was, exploited, by, the, us, to, undermine, the, strength, of, the, soviet, union, and, thus, foster, its, reform, at, the, end, of, the, 1950s, the, ussr, constructed, the, first, satellite, sputnik, 1, which, marked, the, beginning, of, the, space, race, a, competition, to, achieve, superior, spaceflight, capability, with, the, united, states, this, was, followed, by, other, successful, satellites, most, notably, sputnik, 5, where, test, dogs, were, sent, to, space, on, 12, april, 1961, the, ussr, launched, vostok, 1, which, carried, yuri, gagarin, making, him, the, first, human, to, ever, be, launched, into, space, and, complete, a, space, journey, the, first, plans, for, space, shuttles, and, orbital, stations, were, drawn, up, in, soviet, design, offices, but, personal, disputes, between, designers, and, management, prevented, their, development, in, terms, of, the, luna, program, the, ussr, only, had, automated, spacecraft, launches, with, no, crewed, spacecraft, passing, on, the, moon, part, of, space, race, which, was, won, by, the, americans, the, soviet, public, s, reaction, to, the, american, moon, landing, was, mixed, the, soviet, government, limited, the, release, of, information, about, it, which, affected, the, reaction, a, portion, of, the, populace, did, not, give, it, attention, and, another, portion, was, angered, in, the, 1970s, specific, proposals, for, the, design, of, a, space, shuttle, emerged, but, shortcomings, especially, in, the, electronics, industry, rapid, overheating, of, electronics, postponed, it, till, the, end, of, the, 1980s, the, first, shuttle, the, buran, flew, in, 1988, but, without, a, human, crew, another, ptichka, endured, prolonged, construction, and, was, canceled, in, 1991, for, their, launch, into, space, there, is, today, an, unused, superpower, rocket, energia, which, is, the, most, powerful, in, the, world, in, the, late, 1980s, the, soviet, union, built, the, mir, orbital, station, it, was, built, on, the, construction, of, salyut, stations, and, its, only, role, was, civilian, grade, research, tasks, mir, was, the, only, orbital, station, in, operation, from, 1986, to, 1998, gradually, other, modules, were, added, to, it, including, american, modules, however, the, station, deteriorated, rapidly, after, a, fire, on, board, so, in, 2001, it, was, decided, to, bring, it, into, the, atmosphere, where, it, burned, down, transport, was, a, vital, component, of, the, country, s, economy, the, economic, centralization, of, the, late, 1920s, and, 1930s, led, to, the, development, of, infrastructure, on, a, massive, scale, most, notably, the, establishment, of, aeroflot, an, aviation, enterprise, the, country, had, a, wide, variety, of, modes, of, transport, by, land, water, and, air, however, due, to, inadequate, maintenance, much, of, the, road, water, and, soviet, civil, aviation, transport, were, outdated, and, technologically, backward, compared, to, the, first, world, soviet, rail, transport, was, the, largest, and, most, intensively, used, in, the, world, it, was, also, better, developed, than, most, of, its, western, counterparts, by, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, soviet, economists, were, calling, for, the, construction, of, more, roads, to, alleviate, some, of, the, burdens, from, the, railways, and, to, improve, the, soviet, government, budget, the, street, network, and, automotive, industry, remained, underdeveloped, and, dirt, roads, were, common, outside, major, cities, soviet, maintenance, projects, proved, unable, to, take, care, of, even, the, few, roads, the, country, had, by, the, early, to, mid, 1980s, the, soviet, authorities, tried, to, solve, the, road, problem, by, ordering, the, construction, of, new, ones, meanwhile, the, automobile, industry, was, growing, at, a, faster, rate, than, road, construction, the, underdeveloped, road, network, led, to, a, growing, demand, for, public, transport, despite, improvements, several, aspects, of, the, transport, sector, were, still, riddled, with, problems, due, to, outdated, infrastructure, lack, of, investment, corruption, and, bad, decision, making, soviet, authorities, were, unable, to, meet, the, growing, demand, for, transport, infrastructure, and, services, the, soviet, merchant, navy, was, one, of, the, largest, in, the, world, excess, deaths, throughout, world, war, i, and, the, russian, civil, war, including, the, famine, of, 1921, 1922, that, was, triggered, by, lenin, s, war, communism, policies, amounted, to, a, combined, total, of, 18, million, some, 10, million, in, the, 1930s, and, more, than, 20, million, in, 1941, 1945, the, postwar, soviet, population, was, 45, to, 50, million, smaller, than, it, would, have, been, if, pre, war, demographic, growth, had, continued, according, to, catherine, merridale, reasonable, estimate, would, place, the, total, number, of, excess, deaths, for, the, whole, period, somewhere, around, 60, million, the, birth, rate, of, the, ussr, decreased, from, 44, 0, per, thousand, in, 1926, to, 18, 0, in, 1974, mainly, due, to, increasing, urbanization, and, the, rising, average, age, of, marriages, the, mortality, rate, demonstrated, a, gradual, decrease, as, well, from, 23, 7, per, thousand, in, 1926, to, 8, 7, in, 1974, in, general, the, birth, rates, of, the, southern, republics, in, transcaucasia, and, central, asia, were, considerably, higher, than, those, in, the, northern, parts, of, the, soviet, union, and, in, some, cases, even, increased, in, the, post, world, war, ii, period, a, phenomenon, partly, attributed, to, slower, rates, of, urbanization, and, traditionally, earlier, marriages, in, the, southern, republics, soviet, europe, moved, towards, sub, replacement, fertility, while, soviet, central, asia, continued, to, exhibit, population, growth, well, above, replacement, level, fertility, the, late, 1960s, and, the, 1970s, witnessed, a, reversal, of, the, declining, trajectory, of, the, rate, of, mortality, in, the, ussr, and, was, especially, notable, among, men, of, working, age, but, was, also, prevalent, in, russia, and, other, predominantly, slavic, areas, of, the, country, an, analysis, of, the, official, data, from, the, late, 1980s, showed, that, after, worsening, in, the, late, 1970s, and, the, early, 1980s, adult, mortality, began, to, improve, again, the, infant, mortality, rate, increased, from, 24, 7, in, 1970, to, 27, 9, in, 1974, some, researchers, regarded, the, rise, as, mostly, real, a, consequence, of, worsening, health, conditions, and, services, the, rises, in, both, adult, and, infant, mortality, were, not, explained, or, defended, by, soviet, officials, and, the, soviet, government, stopped, publishing, all, mortality, statistics, for, ten, years, soviet, demographers, and, health, specialists, remained, silent, about, the, mortality, increases, until, the, late, 1980s, when, the, publication, of, mortality, data, resumed, and, researchers, could, delve, into, the, real, causes, the, soviet, union, imposed, heavy, control, on, city, growth, preventing, some, cities, from, reaching, their, full, potential, while, promoting, others, for, the, entirety, of, its, existence, the, most, populous, cities, were, moscow, and, leningrad, both, in, russian, sfsr, with, the, third, far, place, taken, by, kiev, ukrainian, ssr, at, its, inception, the, top, 5, was, completed, by, kharkov, ukrainian, ssr, and, baku, azerbaijan, ssr, but, by, the, end, of, the, century, tashkent, uzbek, ssr, which, had, assumed, the, position, of, capital, of, soviet, central, asia, had, risen, to, fourth, place, another, city, worth, mentioning, is, minsk, byelorussian, ssr, which, saw, rapid, growth, during, the, 20th, century, rising, from, the, 32nd, most, populous, in, the, union, to, the, 7th, under, lenin, the, state, made, explicit, commitments, to, promote, the, equality, of, men, and, women, many, early, russian, feminists, and, ordinary, russian, working, women, actively, participated, in, the, revolution, and, many, more, were, affected, by, the, events, of, that, period, and, the, new, policies, beginning, in, october, 1918, lenin, s, government, liberalized, divorce, and, abortion, laws, decriminalized, homosexuality, re, criminalized, in, 1932, permitted, cohabitation, and, ushered, in, a, host, of, reforms, however, without, birth, control, the, new, system, produced, many, broken, marriages, as, well, as, countless, out, of, wedlock, children, the, epidemic, of, divorces, and, extramarital, affairs, created, social, hardships, when, soviet, leaders, wanted, people, to, concentrate, their, efforts, on, growing, the, economy, giving, women, control, over, their, fertility, also, led, to, a, precipitous, decline, in, the, birth, rate, perceived, as, a, threat, to, their, country, s, military, power, by, 1936, stalin, reversed, most, of, the, liberal, laws, ushering, in, a, pronatalist, era, that, lasted, for, decades, by, 1917, russia, became, the, first, great, power, to, grant, women, the, right, to, vote, after, heavy, casualties, in, world, war, i, and, ii, women, outnumbered, men, in, russia, by, a, 4, 3, ratio, this, contributed, to, the, larger, role, women, played, in, russian, society, compared, to, other, great, powers, at, the, time, anatoly, lunacharsky, became, the, first, people, s, commissar, for, education, of, soviet, russia, in, the, beginning, the, soviet, authorities, placed, great, emphasis, on, the, elimination, of, illiteracy, all, left, handed, children, were, forced, to, write, with, their, right, hand, in, the, soviet, school, system, literate, people, were, automatically, hired, as, teachers, for, a, short, period, quality, was, sacrificed, for, quantity, by, 1940, stalin, could, announce, that, illiteracy, had, been, eliminated, throughout, the, 1930s, social, mobility, rose, sharply, which, has, been, attributed, to, reforms, in, education, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, the, country, s, educational, system, expanded, dramatically, which, had, a, tremendous, effect, in, the, 1960s, nearly, all, children, had, access, to, education, the, only, exception, being, those, living, in, remote, areas, nikita, khrushchev, tried, to, make, education, more, accessible, making, it, clear, to, children, that, education, was, closely, linked, to, the, needs, of, society, education, also, became, important, in, giving, rise, to, the, new, man, citizens, directly, entering, the, workforce, had, the, constitutional, right, to, a, job, and, to, free, vocational, training, the, education, system, was, highly, centralized, and, universally, accessible, to, all, citizens, with, affirmative, action, for, applicants, from, nations, associated, with, cultural, backwardness, however, as, part, of, a, general, antisemitic, policy, an, unofficial, jewish, quota, was, applied, in, the, leading, institutions, of, higher, education, by, subjecting, jewish, applicants, to, harsher, entrance, examinations, the, brezhnev, era, also, introduced, a, rule, that, required, all, university, applicants, to, present, a, reference, from, the, local, komsomol, party, secretary, according, to, statistics, from, 1986, the, number, of, higher, education, students, per, the, population, of, 10, 000, was, 181, for, the, ussr, compared, to, 517, for, the, us, the, soviet, union, was, an, ethnically, diverse, country, with, more, than, 100, distinct, ethnic, groups, the, total, population, of, the, country, was, estimated, at, 293, million, in, 1991, according, to, a, 1990, estimate, the, majority, of, the, population, were, russians, 50, 78, followed, by, ukrainians, 15, 45, and, uzbeks, 5, 84, overall, in, 1989, the, ethnic, demography, of, the, country, showed, that, 69, 8, was, east, slavic, 17, 5, was, turkic, 1, 6, were, armenians, 1, 6, were, balts, 1, 5, were, finnic, 1, 5, were, tajik, 1, 4, were, georgian, 1, 2, were, moldovan, and, 4, 1, were, of, other, various, ethnic, groups, all, citizens, of, the, ussr, had, their, own, ethnic, affiliation, the, ethnicity, of, a, person, was, chosen, at, the, age, of, sixteen, by, the, child, s, parents, if, the, parents, did, not, agree, the, child, was, automatically, assigned, the, ethnicity, of, the, father, partly, due, to, soviet, policies, some, of, the, smaller, minority, ethnic, groups, were, considered, part, of, larger, ones, such, as, the, mingrelians, of, georgia, who, were, classified, with, the, linguistically, related, georgians, some, ethnic, groups, voluntarily, assimilated, while, others, were, brought, in, by, force, russians, belarusians, and, ukrainians, who, were, all, east, slavic, and, orthodox, shared, close, cultural, ethnic, and, religious, ties, while, other, groups, did, not, with, multiple, nationalities, living, in, the, same, territory, ethnic, antagonisms, developed, over, the, years, members, of, various, ethnicities, participated, in, legislative, bodies, organs, of, power, like, the, politburo, the, secretariat, of, the, central, committee, etc, were, formally, ethnically, neutral, but, in, reality, ethnic, russians, were, overrepresented, although, there, were, also, non, russian, leaders, in, the, soviet, leadership, such, as, joseph, stalin, grigory, zinoviev, nikolai, podgorny, or, andrei, gromyko, during, the, soviet, era, a, significant, number, of, ethnic, russians, and, ukrainians, migrated, to, other, soviet, republics, and, many, of, them, settled, there, according, to, the, last, census, in, 1989, the, russian, diaspora, in, the, soviet, republics, had, reached, 25, million, in, 1917, before, the, revolution, health, conditions, were, significantly, behind, those, of, developed, countries, as, lenin, later, noted, either, the, lice, will, defeat, socialism, or, socialism, will, defeat, the, lice, the, soviet, health, care, system, was, conceived, by, the, people, s, commissariat, for, health, in, 1918, under, the, semashko, model, health, care, was, to, be, controlled, by, the, state, and, would, be, provided, to, its, citizens, free, of, charge, a, revolutionary, concept, at, the, time, article, 42, of, the, 1977, soviet, constitution, gave, all, citizens, the, right, to, health, protection, and, free, access, to, any, health, institutions, in, the, ussr, before, leonid, brezhnev, became, general, secretary, the, soviet, healthcare, system, was, held, in, high, esteem, by, many, foreign, specialists, this, changed, however, from, brezhnev, s, accession, and, mikhail, gorbachev, s, tenure, as, leader, during, which, the, health, care, system, was, heavily, criticized, for, many, basic, faults, such, as, the, quality, of, service, and, the, unevenness, in, its, provision, minister, of, health, yevgeniy, chazov, during, the, 19th, congress, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, while, highlighting, such, successes, as, having, the, most, doctors, and, hospitals, in, the, world, recognized, the, system, s, areas, for, improvement, and, felt, that, billions, of, rubles, were, squandered, after, the, revolution, life, expectancy, for, all, age, groups, went, up, this, statistic, in, itself, was, seen, by, some, that, the, socialist, system, was, superior, to, the, capitalist, system, these, improvements, continued, into, the, 1960s, when, statistics, indicated, that, the, life, expectancy, briefly, surpassed, that, of, the, united, states, life, expectancy, started, to, decline, in, the, 1970s, possibly, because, of, alcohol, abuse, at, the, same, time, infant, mortality, began, to, rise, after, 1974, the, government, stopped, publishing, statistics, on, the, matter, this, trend, can, be, partly, explained, by, the, number, of, pregnancies, rising, drastically, in, the, asian, part, of, the, country, where, infant, mortality, was, the, highest, while, declining, markedly, in, the, more, developed, european, part, of, the, soviet, union, soviet, dental, technology, and, dental, health, were, considered, notoriously, bad, in, 1991, the, average, 35, year, old, had, 12, to, 14, cavities, fillings, or, missing, teeth, toothpaste, was, often, not, available, and, toothbrushes, did, not, conform, to, standards, of, modern, dentistry, under, lenin, the, government, gave, small, language, groups, their, own, writing, systems, the, development, of, these, writing, systems, was, highly, successful, even, though, some, flaws, were, detected, during, the, later, days, of, the, ussr, countries, with, the, same, multilingual, situation, implemented, similar, policies, a, serious, problem, when, creating, these, writing, systems, was, that, the, languages, differed, dialectally, greatly, from, each, other, when, a, language, had, been, given, a, writing, system, and, appeared, in, a, notable, publication, it, would, attain, official, language, status, there, were, many, minority, languages, which, never, received, their, own, writing, system, therefore, their, speakers, were, forced, to, have, a, second, language, there, are, examples, where, the, government, retreated, from, this, policy, most, notably, under, stalin, where, education, was, discontinued, in, languages, that, were, not, widespread, these, languages, were, then, assimilated, into, another, language, mostly, russian, during, world, war, ii, some, minority, languages, were, banned, and, their, speakers, accused, of, collaborating, with, the, enemy, as, the, most, widely, spoken, of, the, soviet, union, s, many, languages, russian, de, facto, functioned, as, an, official, language, as, the, language, of, interethnic, communication, russian, but, only, assumed, the, de, jure, status, as, the, official, national, language, in, 1990, christianity, and, islam, had, the, highest, number, of, adherents, among, the, religious, citizens, eastern, christianity, predominated, among, christians, with, russia, s, traditional, russian, orthodox, church, being, the, largest, christian, denomination, about, 90, of, the, soviet, union, s, muslims, were, sunnis, with, shias, being, concentrated, in, the, azerbaijan, ssr, smaller, groups, included, roman, catholics, jews, buddhists, and, a, variety, of, protestant, denominations, especially, baptists, and, lutherans, religious, influence, had, been, strong, in, the, russian, empire, the, russian, orthodox, church, enjoyed, a, privileged, status, as, the, church, of, the, monarchy, and, took, part, in, carrying, out, official, state, functions, the, immediate, period, following, the, establishment, of, the, soviet, state, included, a, struggle, against, the, orthodox, church, which, the, revolutionaries, considered, an, ally, of, the, former, ruling, classes, in, soviet, law, the, freedom, to, hold, religious, services, was, constitutionally, guaranteed, although, the, ruling, communist, party, regarded, religion, as, incompatible, with, the, marxist, spirit, of, scientific, materialism, in, practice, the, soviet, system, subscribed, to, a, narrow, interpretation, of, this, right, and, in, fact, used, a, range, of, official, measures, to, discourage, religion, and, curb, the, activities, of, religious, groups, the, 1918, council, of, people, s, commissars, decree, establishing, the, russian, sfsr, as, a, secular, state, also, decreed, that, the, teaching, of, religion, in, all, where, subjects, of, general, instruction, are, taught, is, forbidden, citizens, may, teach, and, may, be, taught, religion, privately, among, further, restrictions, those, adopted, in, 1929, included, express, prohibitions, on, a, range, of, church, activities, including, meetings, for, organized, bible, study, both, christian, and, non, christian, establishments, were, shut, down, by, the, thousands, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, by, 1940, as, many, as, 90, of, the, churches, synagogues, and, mosques, that, had, been, operating, in, 1917, were, closed, the, majority, of, them, were, demolished, or, re, purposed, for, state, needs, with, little, concern, for, their, historic, and, cultural, value, more, than, 85, 000, orthodox, priests, were, shot, in, 1937, alone, only, a, twelfth, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, s, priests, were, left, functioning, in, their, parishes, by, 1941, in, the, period, between, 1927, and, 1940, the, number, of, orthodox, churches, in, russia, fell, from, 29, 584, to, less, than, 500, 1, 7, the, soviet, union, was, officially, a, secular, state, but, a, government, sponsored, program, of, forced, conversion, to, atheism, was, conducted, under, the, doctrine, of, state, atheism, the, government, targeted, religions, based, on, state, interests, and, while, most, organized, religions, were, never, outlawed, religious, property, was, confiscated, believers, were, harassed, and, religion, was, ridiculed, while, atheism, was, propagated, in, schools, in, 1925, the, government, founded, the, league, of, militant, atheists, to, intensify, the, propaganda, campaign, accordingly, although, personal, expressions, of, religious, faith, were, not, explicitly, banned, a, strong, sense, of, social, stigma, was, imposed, on, them, by, the, formal, structures, and, mass, media, and, it, was, generally, considered, unacceptable, for, members, of, certain, professions, teachers, state, bureaucrats, soldiers, to, be, openly, religious, while, persecution, accelerated, following, stalin, s, rise, to, power, a, revival, of, orthodoxy, was, fostered, by, the, government, during, world, war, ii, and, the, soviet, authorities, sought, to, control, the, russian, orthodox, church, rather, than, liquidate, it, during, the, first, five, years, of, soviet, power, the, bolsheviks, executed, 28, russian, orthodox, bishops, and, over, 1, 200, russian, orthodox, priests, many, others, were, imprisoned, or, exiled, believers, were, harassed, and, persecuted, most, seminaries, were, closed, and, the, publication, of, most, religious, material, was, prohibited, by, 1941, only, 500, churches, remained, open, out, of, about, 54, 000, in, existence, before, world, war, i, convinced, that, religious, anti, sovietism, had, become, a, thing, of, the, past, and, with, the, looming, threat, of, war, the, stalin, administration, began, shifting, to, a, more, moderate, religion, policy, in, the, late, 1930s, soviet, religious, establishments, overwhelmingly, rallied, to, support, the, war, effort, during, world, war, ii, amid, other, accommodations, to, religious, faith, after, the, german, invasion, churches, were, reopened, radio, moscow, began, broadcasting, a, religious, hour, and, a, historic, meeting, between, stalin, and, orthodox, church, leader, patriarch, sergius, of, moscow, was, held, in, 1943, stalin, had, the, support, of, the, majority, of, the, religious, people, in, the, ussr, even, through, the, late, 1980s, the, general, tendency, of, this, period, was, an, increase, in, religious, activity, among, believers, of, all, faiths, under, nikita, khrushchev, the, state, leadership, clashed, with, the, churches, in, 1958, 1964, a, period, when, atheism, was, emphasized, in, the, educational, curriculum, and, numerous, state, publications, promoted, atheistic, views, during, this, period, the, number, of, churches, fell, from, 20, 000, to, 10, 000, from, 1959, to, 1965, and, the, number, of, synagogues, dropped, from, 500, to, 97, the, number, of, working, mosques, also, declined, falling, from, 1, 500, to, 500, within, a, decade, religious, institutions, remained, monitored, by, the, soviet, government, but, churches, synagogues, temples, and, mosques, were, all, given, more, leeway, in, the, brezhnev, era, official, relations, between, the, orthodox, church, and, the, government, again, warmed, to, the, point, that, the, brezhnev, government, twice, honored, orthodox, patriarch, alexy, i, with, the, order, of, the, red, banner, of, labour, a, poll, conducted, by, soviet, authorities, in, 1982, recorded, 20, of, the, soviet, population, as, active, religious, believers, the, culture, of, the, soviet, union, passed, through, several, stages, during, the, ussr, s, existence, during, the, first, decade, following, the, revolution, there, was, relative, freedom, and, artists, experimented, with, several, different, styles, to, find, a, distinctive, soviet, style, of, art, lenin, wanted, art, to, be, accessible, to, the, russian, people, on, the, other, hand, hundreds, of, intellectuals, writers, and, artists, were, exiled, or, executed, and, their, work, banned, such, as, nikolay, gumilyov, who, was, shot, for, alleged, conspiracy, against, the, bolsheviks, and, yevgeny, zamyatin, the, government, encouraged, a, variety, of, trends, in, art, and, literature, numerous, schools, some, traditional, and, others, radically, experimental, proliferated, communist, writers, maxim, gorky, and, vladimir, mayakovsky, were, active, during, this, time, as, a, means, of, influencing, a, largely, illiterate, society, films, received, encouragement, from, the, state, and, much, of, director, sergei, eisenstein, s, best, work, dates, from, this, period, during, stalin, s, rule, the, soviet, culture, was, characterized, by, the, rise, and, domination, of, the, government, imposed, style, of, socialist, realism, with, all, other, trends, being, severely, repressed, with, rare, exceptions, such, as, mikhail, bulgakov, s, works, many, writers, were, imprisoned, and, killed, following, the, khrushchev, thaw, censorship, was, diminished, during, this, time, a, distinctive, period, of, soviet, culture, developed, characterized, by, conformist, public, life, and, an, intense, focus, on, personal, life, greater, experimentation, in, art, forms, was, again, permissible, resulting, in, the, production, of, more, sophisticated, and, subtly, critical, work, the, government, loosened, its, emphasis, on, socialist, realism, thus, for, instance, many, protagonists, of, the, novels, of, author, yury, trifonov, concerned, themselves, with, problems, of, daily, life, rather, than, with, building, socialism, underground, dissident, literature, known, as, samizdat, developed, during, this, late, period, in, architecture, the, khrushchev, era, mostly, focused, on, functional, design, as, opposed, to, the, highly, decorated, style, of, stalin, s, epoch, in, music, in, response, to, the, increasing, popularity, of, forms, of, popular, music, like, jazz, in, the, west, many, jazz, orchestras, were, permitted, throughout, the, ussr, notably, the, melodiya, ensemble, named, after, the, principle, record, label, in, the, ussr, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1980s, gorbachev, s, policies, of, perestroika, and, glasnost, significantly, expanded, freedom, of, expression,
