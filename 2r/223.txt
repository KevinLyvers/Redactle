the, inca, empire, officially, known, as, the, realm, of, the, four, parts, quechua, tawantinsuyu, lit, four, parts, together, was, the, largest, empire, in, pre, columbian, america, the, administrative, political, and, military, center, of, the, empire, was, in, the, city, of, cusco, the, inca, civilization, rose, from, the, peruvian, highlands, sometime, in, the, early, 13th, century, the, spanish, began, the, conquest, of, the, inca, empire, in, 1532, and, by, 1572, the, last, inca, state, was, fully, conquered, from, 1438, to, 1533, the, incas, incorporated, a, large, portion, of, western, south, america, centered, on, the, andean, mountains, using, conquest, and, peaceful, assimilation, among, other, methods, at, its, largest, the, empire, joined, modern, day, peru, what, are, now, western, ecuador, western, and, south, central, bolivia, northwest, argentina, the, southwesternmost, tip, of, colombia, and, a, large, portion, of, modern, day, chile, into, a, state, comparable, to, the, historical, empires, of, eurasia, its, official, language, was, quechua, the, inca, empire, was, unique, in, that, it, lacked, many, of, the, features, associated, with, civilization, in, the, old, world, anthropologist, gordon, mcewan, wrote, that, the, incas, were, able, to, construct, one, of, the, greatest, imperial, states, in, human, history, without, the, use, of, the, wheel, draft, animals, knowledge, of, iron, or, steel, or, even, a, system, of, writing, notable, features, of, the, inca, empire, included, its, monumental, architecture, especially, stonework, extensive, road, network, qhapaq, an, reaching, all, corners, of, the, empire, finely, woven, textiles, use, of, knotted, strings, quipu, for, record, keeping, and, communication, agricultural, innovations, and, production, in, a, difficult, environment, and, the, organization, and, management, fostered, or, imposed, on, its, people, and, their, labor, the, inca, empire, functioned, largely, without, money, and, without, markets, instead, exchange, of, goods, and, services, was, based, on, reciprocity, between, individuals, and, among, individuals, groups, and, inca, rulers, taxes, consisted, of, a, labour, obligation, of, a, person, to, the, empire, the, inca, rulers, who, theoretically, owned, all, the, means, of, production, reciprocated, by, granting, access, to, land, and, goods, and, providing, food, and, drink, in, celebratory, feasts, for, their, subjects, many, local, forms, of, worship, persisted, in, the, empire, most, of, them, concerning, local, sacred, huacas, but, the, inca, leadership, encouraged, the, sun, worship, of, inti, their, sun, god, and, imposed, its, sovereignty, above, other, religious, groups, such, as, that, of, pachamama, the, incas, considered, their, king, the, sapa, inca, to, be, the, son, of, the, sun, the, inca, economy, especially, in, the, past, was, often, the, subject, of, scholarly, debate, darrell, e, la, lone, in, his, work, the, inca, as, a, nonmarket, economy, noted, that, scholars, have, previously, described, it, as, feudal, slave, socialist, as, well, as, a, system, based, on, reciprocity, and, redistribution, a, system, with, markets, and, commerce, or, an, asiatic, mode, of, production, the, inca, referred, to, their, empire, as, tawantinsuyu, the, four, suyu, in, quechua, tawa, is, four, and, ntin, is, a, suffix, naming, a, group, so, that, a, tawantin, is, a, quartet, a, group, of, four, things, taken, together, in, this, case, the, four, suyu, regions, or, provinces, whose, corners, met, at, the, capital, the, four, suyu, were, chinchaysuyu, north, antisuyu, east, the, amazon, jungle, qullasuyu, south, and, kuntisuyu, west, the, name, tawantinsuyu, was, therefore, a, descriptive, term, indicating, a, union, of, provinces, the, spanish, transliterated, the, name, as, tahuatinsuyo, or, tahuatinsuyu, while, the, term, inka, nowadays, is, translated, as, ruler, or, lord, in, quechua, this, term, does, not, simply, refer, to, the, king, of, the, tawantinsuyu, or, sapa, inca, but, also, to, the, inca, nobles, and, some, theorize, its, meaning, could, be, broader, in, that, sense, the, inca, nobles, were, a, small, percentage, of, the, total, population, of, the, empire, probably, numbering, only, 15, 000, to, 40, 000, but, ruling, a, population, of, around, 10, million, people, when, the, spanish, arrived, in, the, empire, of, the, incas, they, gave, the, name, peru, to, what, the, natives, knew, as, tawantinsuyu, the, name, inca, empire, imperio, de, los, incas, originated, from, the, chronicles, of, the, 16th, century, the, inca, empire, was, the, last, chapter, of, thousands, of, years, of, andean, civilizations, the, andean, civilization, is, one, of, at, least, five, civilizations, in, the, world, deemed, by, scholars, to, be, pristine, the, concept, of, a, pristine, civilization, refers, to, a, civilization, that, has, developed, independently, of, external, influences, and, is, not, a, derivative, of, other, civilizations, the, inca, empire, was, preceded, by, two, large, scale, empires, in, the, andes, the, tiwanaku, c, 300, 1100, ad, based, around, lake, titicaca, and, the, wari, or, huari, c, 600, 1100, ad, centered, near, the, city, of, ayacucho, the, wari, occupied, the, cuzco, area, for, about, 400, years, thus, many, of, the, characteristics, of, the, inca, empire, derived, from, earlier, multi, ethnic, and, expansive, andean, cultures, to, those, earlier, civilizations, may, be, owed, some, of, the, accomplishments, cited, for, the, inca, empire, thousands, of, kilometres, miles, of, roads, and, dozens, of, large, administrative, centers, with, elaborate, stone, construction, terraced, mountainsides, and, filled, in, valleys, and, the, production, of, vast, quantities, of, goods, carl, troll, has, argued, that, the, development, of, the, inca, state, in, the, central, andes, was, aided, by, conditions, that, allow, for, the, elaboration, of, the, staple, food, chu, o, chu, o, which, can, be, stored, for, long, periods, is, made, of, potato, dried, at, the, freezing, temperatures, that, are, common, at, nighttime, in, the, southern, andean, highlands, such, a, link, between, the, inca, state, and, chu, o, has, been, questioned, as, other, crops, such, as, maize, can, also, be, dried, with, only, sunlight, troll, also, argued, that, llamas, the, incas, pack, animal, can, be, found, in, their, largest, numbers, in, this, very, same, region, the, maximum, extent, of, the, inca, empire, roughly, coincided, with, the, distribution, of, llamas, and, alpacas, the, only, large, domesticated, animals, in, pre, hispanic, america, as, a, third, point, troll, pointed, out, irrigation, technology, as, advantageous, to, inca, state, building, while, troll, theorized, concerning, environmental, influences, on, the, inca, empire, he, opposed, environmental, determinism, arguing, that, culture, lay, at, the, core, of, the, inca, civilization, the, inca, people, were, a, pastoral, tribe, in, the, cusco, area, around, the, 12th, century, indigenous, andean, oral, history, tells, two, main, origin, stories, the, legends, of, manco, capac, and, mama, ocllo, and, that, of, the, ayar, brothers, the, center, cave, at, tampu, t, uqu, tambo, tocco, was, named, qhapaq, t, uqu, principal, niche, also,

be, the, ancestors, of, all, the, inca, clans, ayar, manco, carried, a, magic, staff, made, of, the, finest, gold, where, this, staff, landed, the, people, would, live, they, traveled, for, a, long, time, on, the, way, ayar, cachi, boasted, about, his, strength, and, power, his, siblings, tricked, him, into, returning, to, the, cave, to, get, a, sacred, llama, when, he, went, into, the, cave, they, trapped, him, inside, to, get, rid, of, him, ayar, uchu, decided, to, stay, on, the, top, of, the, cave, to, look, over, the, inca, people, the, minute, he, proclaimed, that, he, turned, to, stone, they, built, a, shrine, around, the, stone, and, it, became, a, sacred, object, ayar, auca, grew, tired, of, all, this, and, decided, to, travel, alone, only, ayar, manco, and, his, four, sisters, remained, finally, they, reached, cusco, the, staff, sank, into, the, ground, before, they, arrived, mama, ocllo, had, already, borne, ayar, manco, a, child, sinchi, roca, the, people, who, were, already, living, in, cusco, fought, hard, to, keep, their, land, but, mama, huaca, was, a, good, fighter, when, the, enemy, attacked, she, threw, her, bolas, several, stones, tied, together, that, spun, through, the, air, when, thrown, at, a, soldier, gualla, and, killed, him, instantly, the, other, people, became, afraid, and, ran, away, after, that, ayar, manco, became, known, as, manco, c, pac, the, founder, of, the, inca, it, is, said, that, he, and, his, sisters, built, the, first, inca, homes, in, the, valley, with, their, own, hands, when, the, time, came, manco, c, pac, turned, to, stone, like, his, brothers, before, him, his, son, sinchi, roca, became, the, second, emperor, of, the, inca, legend, collected, by, the, mestizo, chronicler, inca, garcilaso, de, la, vega, in, his, work, los, comentarios, reales, de, los, incas, transl, the, royal, commentaries, of, the, inca, it, narrates, the, adventure, of, a, couple, manco, c, pac, and, mama, ocllo, who, were, sent, by, the, sun, god, and, emerged, from, the, depths, of, lake, titicaca, pacarina, sacred, place, of, origin, and, marched, north, they, carried, a, golden, staff, given, by, the, sun, god, the, message, was, clear, in, the, place, where, the, golden, staff, sank, they, would, establish, a, city, and, settle, there, the, staff, sank, at, mount, guanacaure, in, the, acamama, valley, therefore, the, couple, decided, to, remain, there, and, informed, the, inhabitants, of, the, area, that, they, were, sent, by, the, sun, god, they, then, proceeded, to, teach, them, agriculture, and, weaving, thus, the, inca, civilization, began, under, the, leadership, of, manco, c, pac, the, inca, formed, the, small, city, state, kingdom, of, cusco, quechua, qusqu, qosqo, in, 1438, they, began, a, far, reaching, expansion, under, the, command, of, sapa, inca, paramount, leader, pachacuti, cusi, yupanqui, whose, name, meant, earth, shaker, the, name, of, pachacuti, was, given, to, him, after, he, conquered, the, tribe, of, chancas, during, the, inca, chanka, war, modern, apur, mac, during, his, reign, he, and, his, son, tupac, yupanqui, brought, much, of, the, modern, day, territory, of, peru, under, inca, control, pachacuti, reorganized, the, kingdom, of, cusco, into, the, tahuantinsuyu, which, consisted, of, a, central, government, with, the, inca, at, its, head, and, four, provincial, governments, with, strong, leaders, chinchasuyu, nw, antisuyu, ne, kuntisuyu, sw, and, qullasuyu, se, pachacuti, is, thought, to, have, built, machu, picchu, either, as, a, family, home, or, summer, retreat, although, it, may, have, been, an, agricultural, station, pachacuti, sent, spies, to, regions, he, wanted, in, his, empire, and, they, brought, to, him, reports, on, political, organization, military, strength, and, wealth, he, then, sent, messages, to, their, leaders, extolling, the, benefits, of, joining, his, empire, offering, them, presents, of, luxury, goods, such, as, high, quality, textiles, and, promising, that, they, would, be, materially, richer, as, his, subjects, most, accepted, the, rule, of, the, inca, as, a, fait, accompli, and, acquiesced, peacefully, refusal, to, accept, inca, rule, resulted, in, military, conquest, following, conquest, the, local, rulers, were, executed, the, ruler, s, children, were, brought, to, cusco, to, learn, about, inca, administration, systems, then, return, to, rule, their, native, lands, this, allowed, the, inca, to, indoctrinate, them, into, the, inca, nobility, and, with, luck, marry, their, daughters, into, families, at, various, corners, of, the, empire, pachacuti, had, named, his, favorite, son, amaru, yupanqui, as, his, co, ruler, and, successor, however, as, co, ruler, amaru, showed, little, interest, in, military, affairs, due, to, this, lack, of, military, talent, he, faced, much, opposition, from, the, inca, nobility, who, began, to, plot, against, him, despite, this, pachacuti, decided, to, take, a, blind, eye, to, his, son, s, lack, of, capability, following, a, revolt, during, which, amaru, almost, led, the, inca, forces, to, defeat, the, sapa, inca, decided, to, replace, the, co, ruler, with, another, one, of, his, sons, t, pac, inca, yupanqui, t, pac, inca, yupanqui, began, conquests, to, the, north, in, 1463, and, continued, them, as, inca, ruler, after, pachacuti, s, death, in, 1471, t, pac, inca, s, most, important, conquest, was, the, kingdom, of, chimor, the, inca, s, only, serious, rival, for, the, coast, t, pac, inca, s, empire, then, stretched, north, into, what, are, today, ecuador, and, colombia, t, pac, inca, s, son, huayna, c, pac, added, a, small, portion, of, land, to, the, north, in, what, is, today, ecuador, at, its, height, the, inca, empire, included, modern, day, peru, what, are, today, western, and, south, central, bolivia, southwest, ecuador, and, colombia, and, a, large, portion, of, modern, day, chile, at, the, north, of, the, maule, river, traditional, historiography, claims, the, advance, south, halted, after, the, battle, of, the, maule, where, they, met, determined, resistance, from, the, mapuche, this, view, is, challenged, by, historian, osvaldo, silva, who, argues, instead, that, it, was, the, social, and, political, framework, of, the, mapuche, that, posed, the, main, difficulty, in, imposing, imperial, rule, silva, does, accept, that, the, battle, of, the, maule, was, a, stalemate, but, argues, the, incas, lacked, incentives, for, conquest, they, had, had, when, fighting, more, complex, societies, such, as, the, chim, empire, silva, also, disputes, the, date, given, by, traditional, historiography, for, the, battle, the, late, 15th, century, during, the, reign, of, topa, inca, yupanqui, 1471, 93, instead, he, places, it, in, 1532, during, the, inca, civil, war, nevertheless, silva, agrees, on, the, claim, that, the, bulk, of, the, inca, conquests, were, made, during, the, late, 15th, century, at, the, time, of, the, inca, civil, war, an, inca, army, was, according, to, diego, de, rosales, subduing, a, revolt, among, the, diaguitas, of, copiap, and, coquimbo, the, empire, s, push, into, the, amazon, basin, near, the, chinchipe, river, was, stopped, by, the, shuar, in, 1527, the, empire, extended, into, corners, of, what, are, today, the, north, of, argentina, and, part, of, the, southern, colombia, however, most, of, the, southern, portion, of, the, inca, empire, the, portion, denominated, as, qullasuyu, was, located, in, the, altiplano, the, inca, empire, was, an, amalgamation, of, languages, cultures, and, peoples, the, components, of, the, empire, were, not, all, uniformly, loyal, nor, were, the, local, cultures, all, fully, integrated, the, inca, empire, as, a, whole, had, an, economy, based, on, exchange, and, taxation, of, luxury, goods, and, labour, the, following, quote, describes, a, method, of, taxation, for, as, is, well, known, to, all, not, a, single, village, of, the, highlands, or, the, plains, failed, to, pay, the, tribute, levied, on, it, by, those, who, were, in, charge, of, these, matters, there, were, even, provinces, where, when, the, natives, alleged, that, they, were, unable, to, pay, their, tribute, the, inca, ordered, that, each, inhabitant, should, be, obliged, to, turn, in, every, four, months, a, large, quill, full, of, live, lice, which, was, the, inca, s, way, of, teaching, and, accustoming, them, to, pay, tribute, spanish, conquistadors, led, by, francisco, pizarro, and, his, brothers, explored, south, from, what, is, today, panama, reaching, inca, territory, by, 1526, it, was, clear, that, they, had, reached, a, wealthy, land, with, prospects, of, great, treasure, and, after, another, expedition, in, 1529, pizarro, traveled, to, spain, and, received, royal, approval, to, conquer, the, region, and, be, its, viceroy, this, approval, was, received, as, detailed, in, the, following, quote, in, july, 1529, the, queen, of, spain, signed, a, charter, allowing, pizarro, to, conquer, the, incas, pizarro, was, named, governor, and, captain, of, all, conquests, in, peru, or, new, castile, as, the, spanish, now, called, the, land, when, the, conquistadors, returned, to, peru, in, 1532, a, war, of, succession, between, the, sons, of, sapa, inca, huayna, capac, hu, scar, and, atahualpa, and, unrest, among, newly, conquered, territories, weakened, the, empire, perhaps, more, importantly, smallpox, influenza, typhus, and, measles, had, spread, from, central, america, the, first, epidemic, of, european, disease, in, the, inca, empire, was, probably, in, the, 1520s, killing, huayna, capac, his, designated, heir, and, an, unknown, probably, large, number, of, other, inca, subjects, the, forces, led, by, pizarro, consisted, of, 168, men, along, with, one, cannon, and, 27, horses, the, conquistadors, were, armed, with, lances, arquebuses, steel, armor, and, long, swords, in, contrast, the, inca, used, weapons, made, out, of, wood, stone, copper, and, bronze, while, using, an, alpaca, fiber, based, armor, putting, them, at, significant, technological, disadvantage, none, of, their, weapons, could, pierce, the, spanish, steel, armor, in, addition, due, to, the, absence, of, horses, in, peru, the, inca, did, not, develop, tactics, to, fight, cavalry, however, the, inca, were, still, effective, warriors, being, able, to, successfully, fight, the, mapuche, who, later, would, strategically, defeat, the, spanish, as, they, expanded, further, south, the, first, engagement, between, the, inca, and, the, spanish, was, the, battle, of, pun, near, present, day, guayaquil, ecuador, on, the, pacific, coast, pizarro, then, founded, the, city, of, piura, in, july, 1532, hernando, de, soto, was, sent, inland, to, explore, the, interior, and, returned, with, an, invitation, to, meet, the, inca, atahualpa, who, had, defeated, his, brother, in, the, civil, war, and, was, resting, at, cajamarca, with, his, army, of, 80, 000, troops, that, were, at, the, moment, armed, only, with, hunting, tools, knives, and, lassos, for, hunting, llamas, pizarro, and, some, of, his, men, most, notably, a, friar, named, vincente, de, valverde, met, with, the, inca, who, had, brought, only, a, small, retinue, the, inca, offered, them, ceremonial, chicha, in, a, golden, cup, which, the, spanish, rejected, the, spanish, interpreter, friar, vincente, read, the, requerimiento, that, demanded, that, he, and, his, empire, accept, the, rule, of, king, charles, i, of, spain, and, convert, to, christianity, atahualpa, dismissed, the, message, and, asked, them, to, leave, after, this, the, spanish, began, their, attack, against, the, mostly, unarmed, inca, captured, atahualpa, as, hostage, and, forced, the, inca, to, collaborate, atahualpa, offered, the, spaniards, enough, gold, to, fill, the, room, he, was, imprisoned, in, and, twice, that, amount, of, silver, the, inca, fulfilled, this, ransom, but, pizarro, deceived, them, refusing, to, release, the, inca, afterwards, during, atahualpa, s, imprisonment, hu, scar, was, assassinated, elsewhere, the, spaniards, maintained, that, this, was, at, atahualpa, s, orders, this, was, used, as, one, of, the, charges, against, atahualpa, when, the, spaniards, finally, executed, him, in, august, 1533, although, defeat, often, implies, an, unwanted, loss, in, battle, many, of, the, diverse, ethnic, groups, ruled, by, the, inca, welcomed, the, spanish, invaders, as, liberators, and, willingly, settled, down, with, them, to, share, rule, of, andean, farmers, and, miners, many, regional, leaders, called, kurakas, continued, to, serve, the, spanish, overlords, called, encomenderos, as, they, had, served, the, inca, overlords, other, than, efforts, to, spread, the, religion, of, christianity, the, spanish, benefited, from, and, made, little, effort, to, change, the, society, and, culture, of, the, former, inca, empire, until, the, rule, of, francisco, de, toledo, as, viceroy, from, 1569, to, 1581, the, spanish, installed, atahualpa, s, brother, manco, inca, yupanqui, in, power, for, some, time, manco, cooperated, with, the, spanish, while, they, fought, to, put, down, resistance, in, the, north, meanwhile, an, associate, of, pizarro, diego, de, almagro, attempted, to, claim, cusco, manco, tried, to, use, this, intra, spanish, feud, to, his, advantage, recapturing, cusco, in, 1536, but, the, spanish, retook, the, city, afterwards, manco, inca, then, retreated, to, the, mountains, of, vilcabamba, and, established, the, small, neo, inca, state, where, he, and, his, successors, ruled, for, another, 36, years, sometimes, raiding, the, spanish, or, inciting, revolts, against, them, in, 1572, the, last, inca, stronghold, was, conquered, and, the, last, ruler, t, pac, amaru, manco, s, son, was, captured, and, executed, this, ended, resistance, to, the, spanish, conquest, under, the, political, authority, of, the, inca, state, after, the, fall, of, the, inca, empire, many, aspects, of, inca, culture, were, systematically, destroyed, including, their, sophisticated, farming, system, known, as, the, vertical, archipelago, model, of, agriculture, spanish, colonial, officials, used, the, inca, mita, corv, e, labor, system, for, colonial, aims, sometimes, brutally, one, member, of, each, family, was, forced, to, work, in, the, gold, and, silver, mines, the, foremost, of, which, was, the, titanic, silver, mine, at, potos, when, a, family, member, died, which, would, usually, happen, within, a, year, or, two, the, family, was, required, to, send, a, replacement, although, smallpox, is, usually, presumed, to, have, spread, through, the, empire, before, the, arrival, of, the, spaniards, the, devastation, is, also, consistent, with, other, theories, beginning, in, colombia, smallpox, spread, rapidly, before, the, spanish, invaders, first, arrived, in, the, empire, the, spread, was, probably, aided, by, the, efficient, inca, road, system, smallpox, was, only, the, first, epidemic, other, diseases, including, a, probable, typhus, outbreak, in, 1546, influenza, and, smallpox, together, in, 1558, smallpox, again, in, 1589, diphtheria, in, 1614, and, measles, in, 1618, all, ravaged, the, inca, people, there, would, be, periodic, attempts, by, indigenous, leaders, to, expel, the, spanish, colonists, and, re, create, the, inca, empire, until, the, late, 18th, century, see, juan, santos, atahualpa, and, t, pac, amaru, ii, the, number, of, people, inhabiting, tawantinsuyu, at, its, peak, is, uncertain, with, estimates, ranging, from, 4, 37, million, most, population, estimates, are, in, the, range, of, 6, to, 14, million, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, the, inca, kept, excellent, census, records, using, their, quipus, knowledge, of, how, to, read, them, was, lost, as, almost, all, fell, into, disuse, and, disintegrated, over, time, or, were, destroyed, by, the, spaniards, the, empire, was, linguistically, diverse, some, of, the, most, important, languages, were, quechua, aymara, puquina, and, mochica, respectively, mainly, spoken, in, the, central, andes, the, altiplano, qullasuyu, the, south, coast, kuntisuyu, and, the, area, of, the, north, coast, chinchaysuyu, around, chan, chan, today, trujillo, other, languages, included, quignam, jaqaru, leco, uru, chipaya, languages, kunza, humahuaca, cac, n, mapudungun, culle, chachapoya, catacao, languages, manta, barbacoan, languages, and, ca, ari, puruh, as, well, as, numerous, amazonian, languages, on, the, frontier, regions, the, exact, linguistic, topography, of, the, pre, columbian, and, early, colonial, andes, remains, incompletely, understood, owing, to, the, extinction, of, several, languages, and, the, loss, of, historical, records, in, order, to, manage, this, diversity, the, inca, lords, promoted, the, usage, of, quechua, especially, the, variety, of, what, is, now, lima, as, the, qhapaq, runasimi, great, language, of, the, people, or, the, official, language, lingua, franca, defined, by, mutual, intelligibility, quechua, is, actually, a, family, of, languages, rather, than, one, single, language, parallel, to, the, romance, or, slavic, languages, in, europe, most, communities, within, the, empire, even, those, resistant, to, inca, rule, learned, to, speak, a, variety, of, quechua, forming, new, regional, varieties, with, distinct, phonetics, in, order, to, communicate, with, the, inca, lords, and, mitma, colonists, as, well, as, the, wider, integrating, society, but, largely, retained, their, native, languages, as, well, the, incas, also, had, their, own, ethnic, language, referred, to, as, qhapaq, simi, royal, language, which, is, thought, to, have, been, closely, related, to, or, a, dialect, of, puquina, there, are, several, common, misconceptions, about, the, history, of, quechua, as, it, is, frequently, identified, as, the, inca, language, quechua, did, not, originate, with, the, incas, had, been, a, lingua, franca, in, multiple, areas, before, the, inca, expansions, was, diverse, before, the, rise, of, the, incas, and, it, was, not, the, native, or, original, language, of, the, incas, however, the, incas, left, a, linguistic, legacy, in, that, they, introduced, quechua, to, many, areas, where, it, is, still, widely, spoken, today, including, ecuador, southern, bolivia, southern, colombia, and, parts, of, the, amazon, basin, the, spanish, conquerors, continued, the, official, usage, of, quechua, during, the, early, colonial, period, and, transformed, it, into, a, literary, language, the, incas, were, not, known, to, develop, a, written, form, of, language, however, they, visually, recorded, narratives, through, paintings, on, vases, and, cups, qirus, these, paintings, are, usually, accompanied, by, geometric, patterns, known, as, toqapu, which, are, also, found, in, textiles, researchers, have, speculated, that, toqapu, patterns, could, have, served, as, a, form, of, written, communication, e, g, heraldry, or, glyphs, however, this, remains, unclear, the, incas, also, kept, records, by, using, quipus, the, high, infant, mortality, rates, that, plagued, the, inca, empire, caused, all, newborn, infants, to, be, given, the, term, wawa, when, they, were, born, most, families, did, not, invest, very, much, into, their, child, until, they, reached, the, age, of, two, or, three, years, old, once, the, child, reached, the, age, of, three, a, coming, of, age, ceremony, occurred, called, the, rutuchikuy, for, the, incas, this, ceremony, indicated, that, the, child, had, entered, the, stage, of, ignorance, during, this, ceremony, the, family, would, invite, all, relatives, to, their, house, for, food, and, dance, and, then, each, member, of, the, family, would, receive, a, lock, of, hair, from, the, child, after, each, family, member, had, received, a, lock, the, father, would, shave, the, child, s, head, this, stage, of, life, was, categorized, by, a, stage, of, ignorance, inexperience, and, lack, of, reason, a, condition, that, the, child, would, overcome, with, time, for, inca, society, in, order, to, advance, from, the, stage, of, ignorance, to, development, the, child, must, learn, the, roles, associated, with, their, gender, the, next, important, ritual, was, to, celebrate, the, maturity, of, a, child, unlike, the, coming, of, age, ceremony, the, celebration, of, maturity, signified, the, child, s, sexual, potency, this, celebration, of, puberty, was, called, warachikuy, for, boys, and, qikuchikuy, for, girls, the, warachikuy, ceremony, included, dancing, fasting, tasks, to, display, strength, and, family, ceremonies, the, boy, would, also, be, given, new, clothes, and, taught, how, to, act, as, an, unmarried, man, the, qikuchikuy, signified, the, onset, of, menstruation, upon, which, the, girl, would, go, into, the, forest, alone, and, return, only, once, the, bleeding, had, ended, in, the, forest, she, would, fast, and, once, returned, the, girl, would, be, given, a, new, name, adult, clothing, and, advice, this, folly, stage, of, life, was, the, time, young, adults, were, allowed, to, have, sex, without, being, a, parent, between, the, ages, of, 20, and, 30, people, were, considered, young, adults, ripe, for, serious, thought, and, labor, young, adults, were, able, to, retain, their, youthful, status, by, living, at, home, and, assisting, in, their, home, community, young, adults, only, reached, full, maturity, and, independence, once, they, had, married, at, the, end, of, life, the, terms, for, men, and, women, denote, loss, of, sexual, vitality, and, humanity, specifically, the, decrepitude, stage, signifies, the, loss, of, mental, well, being, and, further, physical, decline, in, the, inca, empire, the, age, of, marriage, differed, for, men, and, women, men, typically, married, at, the, age, of, 20, while, women, usually, got, married, about, four, years, earlier, at, the, age, of, 16, men, who, were, highly, ranked, in, society, could, have, multiple, wives, but, those, lower, in, the, ranks, could, only, take, a, single, wife, marriages, were, typically, within, classes, and, resembled, a, more, business, like, agreement, once, married, the, women, were, expected, to, cook, collect, food, and, watch, over, the, children, and, livestock, girls, and, mothers, would, also, work, around, the, house, to, keep, it, orderly, to, please, the, public, inspectors, these, duties, remained, the, same, even, after, wives, became, pregnant, and, with, the, added, responsibility, of, praying, and, making, offerings, to, kanopa, who, was, the, god, of, pregnancy, it, was, typical, for, marriages, to, begin, on, a, trial, basis, with, both, men, and, women, having, a, say, in, the, longevity, of, the, marriage, if, the, man, felt, that, it, would, not, work, out, or, if, the, woman, wanted, to, return, to, her, parents, home, the, marriage, would, end, once, the, marriage, was, final, the, only, way, the, two, could, be, divorced, was, if, they, did, not, have, a, child, together, marriage, within, the, empire, was, crucial, for, survival, a, family, was, considered, disadvantaged, if, there, was, not, a, married, couple, at, the, center, because, everyday, life, centered, around, the, balance, of, male, and, female, tasks, according, to, some, historians, such, as, terence, n, d, altroy, male, and, female, roles, were, considered, equal, in, inca, society, the, indigenous, cultures, saw, the, two, genders, as, complementary, parts, of, a, whole, in, other, words, there, was, not, a, hierarchical, structure, in, the, domestic, sphere, for, the, incas, within, the, domestic, sphere, women, came, to, be, known, as, weavers, although, there, is, significant, evidence, to, suggest, that, this, gender, role, did, not, appear, until, colonizing, spaniards, realized, women, s, productive, talents, in, this, sphere, and, used, it, to, their, economic, advantage, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, both, men, and, women, contributed, equally, to, the, weaving, tasks, in, pre, hispanic, andean, culture, women, s, everyday, tasks, included, spinning, watching, the, children, weaving, cloth, cooking, brewing, chichi, preparing, fields, for, cultivation, planting, seeds, bearing, children, harvesting, weeding, hoeing, herding, and, carrying, water, men, on, the, other, hand, weeded, plowed, participated, in, combat, helped, in, the, harvest, carried, firewood, built, houses, herded, llama, and, alpaca, and, spun, and, wove, when, necessary, this, relationship, between, the, genders, may, have, been, complementary, onlooking, spaniards, believed, women, were, treated, like, slaves, because, women, did, not, work, in, spanish, society, to, the, same, extent, and, certainly, did, not, work, in, fields, women, were, sometimes, allowed, to, own, land, and, herds, because, inheritance, was, passed, down, from, both, the, mother, s, and, father, s, side, of, the, family, kinship, within, the, inca, society, followed, a, parallel, line, of, descent, in, other, words, women, descended, from, women, and, men, descended, from, men, due, to, the, parallel, descent, a, woman, had, access, to, land, and, other, assets, through, her, mother, it, was, extremely, classist, and, formal, only, the, children, of, the, central, nobility, and, certain, levels, of, the, curacal, hatun, curaca, received, systematic, education, they, had, to, attend, the, yachaywasi, house, of, knowledge, in, cusco, to, learn, from, the, amautas, wises, and, the, haravicus, poets, they, learned, languages, accounting, astronomy, about, wars, and, political, application, strategies, the, non, formalized, education, for, the, hatun, runas, was, given, in, daily, life, in, practice, it, was, also, given, in, the, assemblies, of, the, ayllu, or, camachico, where, they, were, mainly, taught, the, three, moral, and, legal, principles, ama, quella, don, t, be, lazy, ama, sua, don, t, steal, and, ama, llulla, don, t, lie, due, to, the, dry, climate, that, extends, from, modern, day, peru, to, what, is, now, chile, s, norte, grande, mummification, occurred, naturally, by, desiccation, it, is, believed, that, the, ancient, incas, learned, to, mummify, their, dead, to, show, reverence, to, their, leaders, and, representatives, mummification, was, chosen, to, preserve, the, body, and, to, give, others, the, opportunity, to, worship, them, in, their, death, the, ancient, inca, believed, in, reincarnation, so, preservation, of, the, body, was, vital, for, passage, into, the, afterlife, since, mummification, was, reserved, for, royalty, this, entailed, preserving, power, by, placing, the, deceased, s, valuables, with, the, body, in, places, of, honor, the, bodies, remained, accessible, for, ceremonies, where, they, would, be, removed, and, celebrated, with, the, ancient, inca, mummified, their, dead, with, various, tools, chicha, corn, beer, was, used, to, delay, decomposition, and, the, effects, of, bacterial, activity, on, the, body, the, bodies, were, then, stuffed, with, natural, materials, such, as, vegetable, matter, and, animal, hair, sticks, were, used, to, maintain, their, shape, and, poses, in, addition, to, the, mummification, process, the, inca, would, bury, their, dead, in, the, fetal, position, inside, a, vessel, intended, to, mimic, the, womb, for, preparation, of, their, new, birth, a, ceremony, would, be, held, that, included, music, food, and, drink, for, the, relatives, and, loved, ones, of, the, deceased, the, basic, organizational, principle, of, inca, society, was, duality, or, yanantin, which, was, based, on, kinship, relationships, the, ayllus, were, divided, into, two, parts, that, could, be, hanan, or, hurin, alaasa, or, massaa, uma, or, urco, allauca, or, ichoc, according, to, franklin, pease, these, terms, were, understood, as, high, or, low, right, or, left, male, or, female, inside, or, outside, near, or, far, and, front, or, back, though, the, specific, functions, of, each, part, are, unclear, it, is, documented, that, one, leader, was, subordinate, to, the, other, with, rostworowski, noting, that, in, cuzco, the, upper, half, was, more, important, while, in, ica, the, lower, half, held, more, significance, pease, also, points, out, that, both, halves, were, integrated, through, reciprocity, in, cuzco, hanan, and, hurin, were, opposites, yet, complementary, like, human, hands, in, the, yanantin, inca, myths, were, transmitted, orally, until, early, spanish, colonists, recorded, them, however, some, scholars, claim, that, they, were, recorded, on, quipus, andean, knotted, string, records, the, inca, believed, in, reincarnation, after, death, the, passage, to, the, next, world, was, fraught, with, difficulties, the, spirit, of, the, dead, camaquen, would, need, to, follow, a, long, road, and, during, the, trip, the, assistance, of, a, black, dog, that, could, see, in, the, dark, was, required, most, incas, imagined, the, after, world, to, be, like, an, earthly, paradise, with, flower, covered, fields, and, snow, capped, mountains, it, was, important, to, the, inca, that, they, not, die, as, a, result, of, burning, or, that, the, body, of, the, deceased, not, be, incinerated, burning, would, cause, their, vital, force, to, disappear, and, threaten, their, passage, to, the, after, world, the, inca, nobility, practiced, cranial, deformation, they, wrapped, tight, cloth, straps, around, the, heads, of, newborns, to, shape, their, soft, skulls, into, a, more, conical, form, thus, distinguishing, the, nobility, from, other, social, classes, the, incas, made, human, sacrifices, as, many, as, 4, 000, servants, court, officials, favorites, and, concubines, were, killed, upon, the, death, of, the, inca, huayna, capac, in, 1527, the, incas, performed, child, sacrifices, around, important, events, such, as, the, death, of, the, sapa, inca, or, during, a, famine, these, sacrifices, were, known, as, qhapaq, hucha, the, incas, were, polytheists, who, worshipped, many, gods, these, included, according, to, inca, mythology, there, were, three, different, worlds, created, by, viracocha, the, inca, empire, employed, central, planning, coastal, chiefdoms, within, the, inca, empire, punctually, traded, with, outside, regions, although, they, did, not, operate, a, substantial, internal, market, economy, while, axe, monies, were, used, along, the, northern, coast, where, the, custom, of, reciprocity, was, not, in, place, presumably, by, the, provincial, mindal, e, trading, class, most, households, in, the, empire, lived, in, a, traditional, economy, in, which, households, were, required, to, pay, tributes, usually, in, the, form, of, the, mit, a, corv, e, labor, and, military, obligations, though, barter, or, trueque, was, present, in, some, areas, in, return, the, state, provided, security, food, in, times, of, hardship, through, the, supply, of, emergency, resources, agricultural, projects, e, g, aqueducts, and, terraces, to, increase, productivity, and, occasional, feasts, hosted, by, inca, officials, for, their, subjects, while, mit, a, was, used, by, the, state, to, obtain, labor, individual, villages, had, a, pre, inca, system, of, communal, work, known, as, mink, a, this, system, survives, to, the, modern, day, known, as, mink, a, or, faena, the, economy, rested, on, the, material, foundations, of, the, vertical, archipelago, a, system, of, ecological, complementarity, in, accessing, resources, and, the, cultural, foundation, of, ayni, or, reciprocal, exchange, it, was, the, main, economic, activity, in, the, tawantinsuyu, followed, by, livestock, raising, it, was, a, mixed, economy, with, agrarian, technology, based, on, ancestral, knowledge, such, as, the, andenes, terraces, wachaque, sunken, fields, waru, waru, raised, fields, cochas, artificial, lakes, and, the, improvement, of, cultivation, tools, like, the, chaquitaclla, and, the, raucana, the, potato, was, the, staple, food, with, over, 200, species, and, 5000, different, varieties, while, corn, and, coca, were, considered, sacred, plants, they, also, built, agrobiological, experimentation, centers, such, as, moray, cusco, castrovirreyna, huancavelica, and, carania, yauyos, through, circular, terraces, where, the, products, of, the, entire, empire, were, reproduced, in, pre, hispanic, andes, camelids, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, economy, the, domesticated, species, llama, and, alpaca, were, raised, in, large, herds, and, used, for, various, purposes, within, the, inca, production, system, additionally, two, wild, camelid, species, vicu, a, and, guanaco, were, also, utilized, vicu, as, were, hunted, through, collective, drives, chacos, sheared, with, tools, like, stones, knives, and, metal, axes, and, then, released, to, maintain, their, population, guanacos, were, hunted, for, their, highly, valued, meat, chronicles, indicate, that, all, camelid, meat, was, consumed, but, due, to, restrictions, on, slaughter, its, consumption, was, likely, considered, a, luxury, fresh, meat, was, probably, accessible, mainly, to, the, military, or, during, ceremonial, occasions, involving, widespread, distribution, of, sacrificed, animals, during, the, colonial, period, pastures, diminished, or, degraded, due, to, the, massive, presence, of, introduced, spanish, animals, and, their, feeding, habits, significantly, altering, the, andean, environment, the, sapa, inca, the, head, of, upper, cusco, was, conceptualized, as, divine, and, was, effectively, head, of, the, state, religion, the, willaq, umu, or, chief, priest, the, head, of, lower, cusco, was, second, to, the, emperor, local, religious, traditions, continued, and, in, some, cases, such, as, the, oracle, at, pachacamac, on, the, coast, were, officially, venerated, following, pachacuti, the, sapa, inca, claimed, descent, from, inti, who, placed, a, high, value, on, imperial, blood, by, the, end, of, the, empire, it, was, common, to, incestuously, wed, brother, and, sister, he, was, son, of, the, sun, and, his, people, the, intip, churin, or, children, of, the, sun, and, both, his, right, to, rule, and, mission, to, conquer, derived, from, his, holy, ancestor, the, sapa, inca, also, presided, over, ideologically, important, festivals, notably, during, the, inti, raymi, or, sunfest, attended, by, soldiers, mummified, rulers, nobles, clerics, and, the, general, population, of, cusco, beginning, on, the, june, solstice, and, culminating, nine, days, later, with, the, ritual, breaking, of, the, earth, using, a, foot, plow, by, the, inca, moreover, cusco, was, considered, cosmologically, central, loaded, as, it, was, with, huacas, and, radiating, ceque, lines, as, the, geographic, center, of, the, four, quarters, inca, garcilaso, de, la, vega, called, it, the, navel, of, the, universe, the, inca, empire, was, a, decentralized, government, consisting, of, a, central, government, with, the, inca, at, its, head, and, four, regional, quarters, or, suyu, the, four, corners, of, these, quarters, met, at, the, center, cusco, these, suyu, were, likely, created, around, 1460, during, the, reign, of, pachacuti, before, the, empire, reached, its, largest, territorial, extent, at, the, time, the, suyu, were, established, they, were, roughly, of, equal, size, and, only, later, changed, their, proportions, as, the, empire, expanded, north, and, south, along, the, andes, cusco, was, likely, not, organized, as, a, wamani, or, province, rather, it, was, probably, somewhat, akin, to, a, modern, federal, district, like, washington, dc, or, mexico, city, the, city, sat, at, the, center, of, the, four, suyu, and, served, as, the, preeminent, center, of, politics, and, religion, while, cusco, was, essentially, governed, by, the, sapa, inca, his, relatives, and, the, royal, panaqa, lineages, each, suyu, was, governed, by, an, apu, a, term, of, esteem, used, for, men, of, high, status, and, for, venerated, mountains, both, cusco, as, a, district, and, the, four, suyu, as, administrative, regions, were, grouped, into, upper, hanan, and, lower, hurin, divisions, as, the, inca, did, not, have, written, records, it, is, impossible, to, exhaustively, list, the, constituent, wamani, however, colonial, records, allow, us, to, reconstruct, a, partial, list, there, were, likely, more, than, 86, wamani, with, more, than, 48, in, the, highlands, and, more, than, 38, on, the, coast, the, most, populous, suyu, was, chinchaysuyu, which, encompassed, the, former, chimu, empire, and, much, of, the, northern, andes, at, its, largest, extent, it, extended, through, much, of, what, are, now, ecuador, and, colombia, the, largest, suyu, by, area, was, qullasuyu, named, after, the, aymara, speaking, qulla, people, it, encompassed, what, is, now, the, bolivian, altiplano, and, much, of, the, southern, andes, reaching, what, is, now, argentina, and, as, far, south, as, the, maipo, or, maule, river, in, modern, central, chile, historian, jos, bengoa, singled, out, quillota, as, likely, being, the, foremost, inca, settlement, in, chile, the, second, smallest, suyu, antisuyu, was, northwest, of, cusco, in, the, high, andes, its, name, is, the, root, of, the, word, andes, kuntisuyu, was, the, smallest, suyu, located, along, the, southern, coast, of, modern, peru, extending, into, the, highlands, towards, cusco, the, inca, state, had, no, separate, judiciary, or, codified, laws, customs, expectations, and, traditional, local, power, holders, governed, behavior, the, state, had, legal, force, such, as, through, tokoyrikoq, lit, he, who, sees, all, or, inspectors, the, highest, such, inspector, typically, a, blood, relative, to, the, sapa, inca, acted, independently, of, the, conventional, hierarchy, providing, a, point, of, view, for, the, sapa, inca, free, of, bureaucratic, influence, the, inca, had, three, moral, precepts, that, governed, their, behavior, colonial, sources, are, not, entirely, clear, or, in, agreement, about, inca, government, structure, such, as, exact, duties, and, functions, of, government, positions, but, the, basic, structure, can, be, broadly, described, the, top, was, the, sapa, inca, who, wore, the, maskaypacha, as, a, symbol, of, power, below, that, may, have, been, the, willaq, umu, literally, the, priest, who, recounts, the, high, priest, of, the, sun, however, beneath, the, sapa, inca, also, sat, the, inkap, rantin, who, was, a, confidant, and, assistant, to, the, sapa, inca, perhaps, similar, to, a, prime, minister, starting, with, topa, inca, yupanqui, a, council, of, the, realm, was, composed, of, 16, nobles, 2, from, hanan, cusco, 2, from, hurin, cusco, 4, from, chinchaysuyu, 2, from, cuntisuyu, 4, from, collasuyu, and, 2, from, antisuyu, this, weighting, of, representation, balanced, the, hanan, and, hurin, divisions, of, the, empire, both, within, cusco, and, within, the, quarters, hanan, suyukuna, and, hurin, suyukuna, while, provincial, bureaucracy, and, government, varied, greatly, the, basic, organization, was, decimal, taxpayers, male, heads, of, household, of, a, certain, age, range, were, organized, into, corv, e, labor, units, often, doubling, as, military, units, that, formed, the, state, s, muscle, as, part, of, mit, a, service, each, unit, of, more, than, 100, tax, payers, were, headed, by, a, kuraka, while, smaller, units, were, headed, by, a, kamayuq, a, lower, non, hereditary, status, however, while, kuraka, status, was, hereditary, and, typically, served, for, life, the, position, of, a, kuraka, in, the, hierarchy, was, subject, to, change, based, on, the, privileges, of, superiors, in, the, hierarchy, a, pachaka, kuraka, could, be, appointed, to, the, position, by, a, waranqa, kuraka, furthermore, one, kuraka, in, each, decimal, level, could, serve, as, the, head, of, one, of, the, nine, groups, at, a, lower, level, so, that, a, pachaka, kuraka, might, also, be, a, waranqa, kuraka, in, effect, directly, responsible, for, one, unit, of, 100, tax, payers, and, less, directly, responsible, for, nine, other, such, units, we, can, assure, your, majesty, that, it, is, so, beautiful, and, has, such, fine, buildings, that, it, would, even, be, remarkable, in, spain, francisco, pizarro, architecture, was, the, most, important, of, the, inca, arts, with, textiles, reflecting, architectural, motifs, the, most, notable, example, is, machu, picchu, which, was, constructed, by, inca, engineers, the, prime, inca, structures, were, made, of, stone, blocks, that, fit, together, so, well, that, a, knife, could, not, be, fitted, through, the, stonework, these, constructs, have, survived, for, centuries, with, no, use, of, mortar, to, sustain, them, this, process, was, first, used, on, a, large, scale, by, the, pucara, c, 300, bc, ad, 300, peoples, to, the, south, in, lake, titicaca, and, later, in, the, city, of, tiwanaku, c, ad, 400, 1100, in, what, is, now, bolivia, the, rocks, were, sculpted, to, fit, together, exactly, by, repeatedly, lowering, a, rock, onto, another, and, carving, away, any, sections, on, the, lower, rock, where, the, dust, was, compressed, the, tight, fit, and, the, concavity, on, the, lower, rocks, made, them, extraordinarily, stable, despite, the, ongoing, challenge, of, earthquakes, and, volcanic, activity, tunics, were, created, by, skilled, inca, textile, makers, as, a, piece, of, warm, clothing, but, they, also, symbolized, cultural, and, political, status, and, power, cumbi, was, the, fine, tapestry, woven, woolen, cloth, that, was, produced, and, necessary, for, the, creation, of, tunics, cumbi, was, produced, by, specially, appointed, women, and, men, generally, textile, making, was, practiced, by, both, men, and, women, as, emphasized, by, certain, historians, only, with, european, conquest, was, it, deemed, that, women, would, become, the, primary, weavers, in, society, as, opposed, to, inca, society, where, specialty, textiles, were, produced, by, men, and, women, equally, complex, patterns, and, designs, were, meant, to, convey, information, about, order, in, andean, society, as, well, as, the, universe, tunics, could, also, symbolize, one, s, relationship, to, ancient, rulers, or, important, ancestors, these, textiles, were, frequently, designed, to, represent, the, physical, order, of, a, society, for, example, the, flow, of, tribute, within, an, empire, many, tunics, have, a, checkerboard, effect, which, is, known, as, the, collcapata, according, to, historians, kenneth, mills, william, b, taylor, and, sandra, lauderdale, graham, the,

distinctive, inca, ceramic, objects, are, the, urpu, cusco, bottles, or, aryballos, mainly, used, for, the, production, of, chicha, many, of, these, pieces, are, on, display, in, lima, in, the, larco,

17th, centuries, support, the, idea, of, a, banner, however, it, represented, the, inca, emperor, not, the, empire, francisco, l, pez, de, jerez, wrote, in, 1534, todos, ven, an, repartidos, en, sus,

ones, though, the, sign, of, the, incas, was, the, rainbow, and, two, parallel, snakes, along, the, width, with, the, tassel, as, a, crown, which, each, king, used, to, add, for, a, badge, or, blazon,

says, that, in, the, inca, army, each, company, had, its, particular, banner, and, that, the, imperial, standard, high, above, all, displayed, the, glittering, device, of, the, rainbow, the, armorial, ensign, of, the, incas, a, 1917, world, flags, book, says, the, inca, heir, apparent, was, entitled, to, display, the, royal, standard, of, the, rainbow, in, his, military, campaigns, in, modern, times, the, rainbow, flag, has, been, wrongly, associated, with, the, tawantinsuyu, and, displayed, as, a, symbol, of, inca, heritage, by, some, groups, in, peru, and, bolivia, the, city, of, cusco, also, flies, the, rainbow, flag, but, as, an, official, flag, of, the, city, the, peruvian, president, alejandro, toledo, 2001, 2006, flew, the, rainbow, flag, in, lima, s, presidential, palace, however, according, to, the, peruvian, historiography, the, inca, empire, never, had, a, flag, peruvian, historian, mar, a, rostworowski, said, i, bet, my, life, the, inca, never, had, that, flag, it, never, existed, no, chronicler, mentioned, it, also, to, the, peruvian, newspaper, el, comercio, the, flag, dates, to, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, and, even, the, congress, of, the, republic, of, peru, has, determined, that, the, flag, is, a, fake, by, citing, the, conclusion, of, the, national, academy, of, peruvian, history, the, official, use, of, the, wrongly, called, tawantinsuyu, flag, is, a, mistake, in, the, pre, hispanic, andean, world, there, did, not, exist, the, concept, of, a, flag, it, did, not, belong, to, their, historic, context, national, academy, of, peruvian, history, ancient, andean, inhabitants, shared, their, experiences, through, singing, and, dancing, with, aqqa, chicha, de, jora, though, these, practices, reflected, social, inequalities, as, some, dances, and, songs, were, reserved, for, nobles, incaic, andean, music, was, pentatonic, using, notes, re, fa, sol, la, and, do, they, composed, taki, songs, with, wind, and, percussion, instruments, lacking, string, instruments, key, wind, instruments, included, the, quena, made, of, cane, and, bone, zampo, a, pututo, or, huayla, quippa, cuyhui, a, five, voice, whistle, and, pincullo, a, long, flute, percussion, instruments, included, tinya, a, simple, small, drum, huankar, a, large, drum, with, a, stick, silver, rattles, and, chilchile, bells, dances, were, categorized, as, nobiliary, dances, for, the, sapa, inca, and, the, panacas, such, as, uaricsa, arawi, and, guayara, as, well, as, guari, for, young, nobles, masked, men, s, war, dances, such, as, wacon, and, collective, dances, for, laborers, haylli, shepherds, guayayturilla, and, the, ayllu, in, their, tasks, kashua, physical, measures, used, by, the, inca, were, based, on, human, body, parts, units, included, fingers, the, distance, from, thumb, to, forefinger, palms, cubits, and, wingspans, the, most, basic, distance, unit, was, thatkiy, or, thatki, or, one, pace, the, next, largest, unit, was, reported, by, cobo, to, be, the, topo, or, tupu, measuring, 6, 000, thatkiy, s, or, about, 7, 7, km, 4, 8, mi, careful, study, has, shown, that, a, range, of, 4, 0, to, 6, 3, km, 2, 5, to, 3, 9, mi, is, likely, next, was, the, wamani, composed, of, 30, topo, s, roughly, 232, km, or, 144, mi, to, measure, area, 25, by, 50, wingspans, were, used, reckoned, in, topo, s, roughly, 3, 280, km, 2, or, 1, 270, sq, mi, it, seems, likely, that, distance, was, often, interpreted, as, one, day, s, walk, the, distance, between, tambo, way, stations, varies, widely, in, terms, of, distance, but, far, less, in, terms, of, time, to, walk, that, distance, inca, calendars, were, strongly, tied, to, astronomy, inca, astronomers, understood, equinoxes, solstices, and, zenith, passages, along, with, the, venus, cycle, they, could, not, however, predict, eclipses, the, inca, calendar, was, essentially, lunisolar, as, two, calendars, were, maintained, in, parallel, one, solar, and, one, lunar, as, 12, lunar, months, fall, 11, days, short, of, a, full, 365, day, solar, year, those, in, charge, of, the, calendar, had, to, adjust, every, winter, solstice, each, lunar, month, was, marked, with, festivals, and, rituals, apparently, the, days, of, the, week, were, not, named, and, days, were, not, grouped, into, weeks, similarly, months, were, not, grouped, into, seasons, time, during, a, day, was, not, measured, in, hours, or, minutes, but, in, terms, of, how, far, the, sun, had, travelled, or, in, how, long, it, had, taken, to, perform, a, task, the, sophistication, of, inca, administration, calendrics, and, engineering, required, facility, with, numbers, numerical, information, was, stored, in, the, knots, of, quipu, strings, allowing, for, compact, storage, of, large, numbers, these, numbers, were, stored, in, base, 10, digits, the, same, base, used, by, the, quechua, language, and, in, administrative, and, military, units, these, numbers, stored, in, quipu, could, be, calculated, on, yupanas, grids, with, squares, of, positionally, varying, mathematical, values, perhaps, functioning, as, an, abacus, calculation, was, facilitated, by, moving, piles, of, tokens, seeds, or, pebbles, between, compartments, of, the, yupana, it, is, likely, that, inca, mathematics, at, least, allowed, division, of, integers, into, integers, or, fractions, and, multiplication, of, integers, and, fractions, according, to, mid, 17th, century, jesuit, chronicler, bernab, cobo, the, inca, designated, officials, to, perform, accounting, related, tasks, these, officials, were, called, quipo, camayos, study, of, khipu, sample, va, 42527, museum, f, r, v, lkerkunde, berlin, revealed, that, the, numbers, arranged, in, calendrically, significant, patterns, were, used, for, agricultural, purposes, in, the, farm, account, books, kept, by, the, khipukamayuq, accountant, or, warehouse, keeper, to, facilitate, the, closing, of, accounting, books, the, inca, recorded, information, on, assemblages, of, knotted, strings, known, as, quipu, although, they, can, no, longer, be, decoded, originally, it, was, thought, that, quipu, were, used, only, as, mnemonic, devices, or, to, record, numerical, data, quipus, are, also, believed, to, record, history, and, literature, the, inca, made, many, discoveries, in, medicine, they, performed, successful, skull, surgery, by, cutting, holes, in, the, skull, to, alleviate, fluid, buildup, and, inflammation, caused, by, head, wounds, many, skull, surgeries, performed, by, inca, surgeons, were, successful, survival, rates, were, 80, 90, compared, to, about, 30, before, inca, times, according, to, chronicler, bernab, cobo, they, also, had, a, deep, knowledge, of, herbalism, and, the, spanish, soldiers, trusted, the, hands, of, an, indigenous, surgeon, more, than, one, of, the, barbers, who, accompanied, them, the, inca, army, was, the, most, powerful, at, that, time, because, any, ordinary, villager, or, farmer, could, be, recruited, as, a, soldier, as, part, of, the, mit, a, system, of, mandatory, public, service, every, able, bodied, male, inca, of, fighting, age, had, to, take, part, in, war, in, some, capacity, at, least, once, and, to, prepare, for, warfare, again, when, needed, by, the, time, the, empire, reached, its, largest, size, every, section, of, the, empire, contributed, in, setting, up, an, army, for, war, the, incas, had, no, iron, or, steel, and, their, weapons, were, not, much, more, effective, than, those, of, their, opponents, so, they, often, defeated, opponents, by, sheer, force, of, numbers, or, else, by, persuading, them, to, surrender, beforehand, by, offering, generous, terms, inca, weaponry, included, hardwood, spears, launched, using, throwers, arrows, javelins, slings, the, bolas, clubs, and, maces, with, star, shaped, heads, made, of, copper, or, bronze, rolling, rocks, downhill, onto, the, enemy, was, a, common, strategy, taking, advantage, of, the, hilly, terrain, fighting, was, sometimes, accompanied, by, drums, and, trumpets, made, of, wood, shell, or, bone, armor, included, roads, allowed, quick, movement, on, foot, for, the, inca, army, shelters, called, tambo, and, storage, silos, called, qullqas, were, built, one, day, s, travelling, distance, from, each, other, so, an, army, on, campaign, could, be, fed, and, rested, this, can, be, seen, in, names, of, ruins, such, as, ollantaytambo, or, my, lord, s, storehouse, these, were, set, up, so, the, inca, and, his, entourage, would, always, have, supplies, and, possibly, shelter, ready, as, they, traveled, the, people, of, the, andes, including, the, incas, were, able, to, adapt, to, high, altitude, living, through, successful, acclimatization, which, is, characterized, by, increasing, oxygen, supply, to, the, blood, tissues, for, the, native, living, in, the, andean, highlands, this, was, achieved, through, the, development, of, a, larger, lung, capacity, and, an, increase, in, red, blood, cell, counts, hemoglobin, concentration, and, capillary, beds, compared, to, other, humans, the, andeans, had, slower, heart, rates, almost, one, third, larger, lung, capacity, about, 2, l, 4, pints, more, blood, volume, and, double, the, amount, of, hemoglobin, which, transfers, oxygen, from, the, lungs, to, the, rest, of, the, body, while, the, conquistadors, may, have, been, taller, the, inca, had, the, advantage, of, coping, with, the, extraordinary, altitude, the, tibetans, in, asia, living, in, the, himalayas, are, also, adapted, to, living, in, high, altitudes, although, the, adaptation, is, different, from, that, of, the, andeans
