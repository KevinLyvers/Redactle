october, 1917, october, 1917, the, eastern, front, or, eastern, theater, of, world, war, i, german, ostfront, romanian, frontul, de, r, s, rit, for, russia, second, patriotic, war, russian, was, a, theater, of, operations, that, encompassed, at, its, greatest, extent, the, entire, frontier, between, russia, and, romania, on, one, side, and, austria, hungary, bulgaria, the, ottoman, empire, and, germany, on, the, other, it, ranged, from, the, baltic, sea, in, the, north, to, the, black, sea, in, the, south, involved, most, of, eastern, europe, and, stretched, deep, into, central, europe, the, term, contrasts, with, the, western, front, which, was, being, fought, in, belgium, and, france, during, 1910, russian, general, yuri, danilov, developed, plan, 19, under, which, four, armies, would, invade, east, prussia, this, plan, was, criticised, as, austria, hungary, could, be, a, greater, threat, than, the, german, empire, so, instead, of, four, armies, invading, east, prussia, the, russians, planned, to, send, two, armies, to, east, prussia, and, two, armies, to, defend, against, austro, hungarian, forces, invading, from, galicia, in, the, opening, months, of, the, war, the, imperial, russian, army, attempted, an, invasion, of, eastern, prussia, in, the, northwestern, theater, only, to, be, beaten, back, by, germany, after, some, initial, success, at, the, same, time, in, the, south, they, successfully, invaded, galicia, defeating, the, austro, hungarian, forces, there, in, russian, poland, the, germans, failed, to, take, warsaw, but, by, 1915, the, german, and, austro, hungarian, forces, were, on, the, advance, dealing, the, russians, heavy, casualties, in, galicia, and, in, poland, forcing, them, to, retreat, grand, duke, nicholas, was, sacked, from, his, position, as, the, commander, in, chief, and, replaced, by, tsar, nicholas, himself, several, offensives, against, the, germans, in, 1916, failed, including, the, lake, naroch, offensive, and, the, baranovichi, offensive, however, general, aleksei, brusilov, oversaw, a, highly, successful, operation, against, austria, hungary, that, became, known, as, the, brusilov, offensive, which, saw, the, russian, army, make, large, gains, being, the, largest, and, most, lethal, offensive, of, world, war, i, the, effects, of, the, brusilov, offensive, were, far, reaching, it, helped, to, relieve, the, german, pressure, during, the, battle, of, verdun, while, also, helping, to, relieve, the, austro, hungarian, pressure, on, the, italians, as, a, result, the, austro, hungarian, armed, forces, were, fatally, weakened, and, finally, romania, decided, to, enter, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, allies, however, the, russian, human, and, material, losses, also, greatly, contributed, to, the, russian, revolutions, romania, entered, the, war, in, august, 1916, the, allied, powers, promised, the, region, of, transylvania, which, was, part, of, austria, hungary, in, return, for, romanian, support, the, romanian, army, invaded, transylvania, and, had, initial, successes, but, was, forced, to, stop, and, was, pushed, back, by, the, germans, and, austro, hungarians, when, bulgaria, attacked, them, from, the, south, meanwhile, a, revolution, occurred, in, russia, in, march, 1917, one, of, the, causes, being, the, hardships, of, the, war, tsar, nicholas, ii, was, forced, to, abdicate, and, a, russian, provisional, government, was, founded, with, georgy, lvov, as, its, first, leader, who, was, eventually, replaced, by, alexander, kerensky, the, russian, republic, continued, to, fight, the, war, alongside, romania, and, the, rest, of, the, entente, in, desultory, fashion, it, was, overthrown, by, the, bolsheviks, in, november, 1917, following, the, armistice, of, foc, ani, between, romania, and, the, central, powers, romania, also, signed, a, peace, treaty, with, the, central, powers, on, 7, may, 1918, however, it, was, canceled, by, romania, on, 10, november, 1918, the, new, government, established, by, the, bolsheviks, signed, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, with, the, central, powers, in, march, 1918, taking, it, out, of, the, war, leading, to, a, central, powers, victory, however, the, western, allied, powers, soon, defeated, the, central, powers, with, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, being, annulled, by, the, armistice, of, 11, november, 1918, the, front, in, the, east, was, much, longer, than, that, in, the, west, the, theater, of, war, was, roughly, delineated, by, the, baltic, sea, in, the, west, and, minsk, in, the, east, and, saint, petersburg, in, the, north, and, the, black, sea, in, the, south, a, distance, of, more, than, 1, 600, kilometres, 990, mi, this, had, a, drastic, effect, on, the, nature, of, the, warfare, while, the, war, on, the, western, front, developed, into, trench, warfare, the, battle, lines, on, the, eastern, front, were, much, more, fluid, and, trenches, never, truly, developed, this, was, because, the, greater, length, of, the, front, ensured, that, the, density, of, soldiers, in, the, line, was, lower, so, the, line, was, easier, to, break, once, broken, the, sparse, communication, networks, made, it, difficult, for, the, defender, to, rush, reinforcements, to, the, rupture, in, the, line, mounting, rapid, counteroffensives, to, seal, off, any, breakthrough, propaganda, was, a, key, component, of, the, culture, of, world, war, i, it, was, often, shown, through, state, controlled, media, and, helped, to, bolster, nationalism, and, patriotism, within, countries, on, the, eastern, front, propaganda, took, many, forms, such, as, opera, film, spy, fiction, theater, spectacle, war, novels, and, graphic, art, across, the, eastern, front, the, amount, of, propaganda, used, in, each, country, varied, from, state, to, state, propaganda, took, many, forms, within, each, country, and, was, distributed, by, many, different, groups, most, commonly, the, state, produced, propaganda, but, other, groups, such, as, anti, war, organizations, also, generated, propaganda, prior, to, the, outbreak, of, war, german, strategy, was, based, almost, entirely, on, the, so, called, schlieffen, plan, with, the, franco, russian, agreement, in, place, germany, knew, that, war, with, either, of, these, combatants, would, result, in, war, with, the, other, which, meant, that, there, would, be, war, in, both, the, west, and, the, east, two, front, war, therefore, the, german, general, staff, under, alfred, von, schlieffen, and, then, helmuth, von, moltke, the, younger, planned, a, quick, all, out, ground, war, on, the, western, front, to, take, france, and, upon, victory, germany, would, turn, its, attention, to, russia, in, the, east, schlieffen, believed, russia, would, not, be, ready, or, willing, to, move, against, and, attack, germany, due, to, the, huge, losses, of, military, equipment, that, russia, had, suffered, in, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 1905, its, low, population, density, and, lack, of, railroads, conversely, the, imperial, german, navy, believed, it, could, be, victorious, over, britain, with, russian, neutrality, something, which, moltke, knew, would, not, be, possible, in, the, immediate, years, preceding, the, first, world, war, the, kingdom, of, romania, was, involved, in, the, second, balkan, war, on, the, side, of, serbia, montenegro, greece, and, the, ottoman, empire, against, bulgaria, the, treaty, of, bucharest, signed, on, 10, august, 1913, ended, the, balkan, conflict, and, added, 6, 960, square, kilometers, to, romania, s, territory, although, militarized, romania, decided, upon, a, policy, of, neutrality, at, the, start, of, the, first, world, war, mainly, due, to, having, territorial, interests, in, both, austria, hungary, transylvania, and, bukovina, and, in, russia, bessarabia, strong, cultural, influences, also, affected, romanian, leanings, however, king, carol, i, as, a, hohenzollern, sigmaringen, favoured, his, germanic, roots, while, the, romanian, people, influenced, by, their, orthodox, church, and, latin, based, language, were, inclined, to, join, france, perhaps, king, carol, s, attempts, at, joining, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, central, powers, would, have, been, fruitful, had, he, not, died, in, 1914, but, romanian, disenchantment, with, austria, hungary, had, already, influenced, public, and, political, opinion, french, endorsement, of, romanian, action, against, bulgaria, and, support, of, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, bucharest, was, particularly, effective, at, inclining, romania, towards, the, entente, furthermore, russian, courting, of, romanian, sympathies, exemplified, by, the, visit, of, the, tsar, to, constan, a, on, 14, june, 1914, signaled, in, a, new, era, of, positive, relations, between, the, two, countries, nevertheless, king, ferdinand, i, of, romania, maintained, a, policy, of, neutrality, intending, to, gain, the, most, for, romania, by, negotiating, between, competing, powers, the, result, of, the, negotiations, with, the, entente, was, the, treaty, of, bucharest, 1916, which, stipulated, the, conditions, under, which, romania, agreed, to, join, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, entente, particularly, territorial, promises, in, austria, hungary, transylvania, cri, ana, and, maramure, the, whole, banat, and, most, of, bukovina, according, to, historian, john, keegan, these, enticements, offered, by, the, allies, were, never, concrete, for, in, secret, russia, and, france, agreed, not, to, honor, any, conventions, when, the, end, of, the, war, came, the, immediate, reason, for, russia, s, involvement, in, the, first, world, war, was, a, direct, result, of, the, decisions, made, by, the, statesmen, and, generals, during, july, 1914, the, july, crisis, was, the, culmination, of, a, series, of, diplomatic, conflicts, that, took, place, in, the, decades, prior, to, 1914, and, this, is, fundamental, to, an, understanding, of, russia, s, position, immediately, prior, to, the, war, according, to, d, c, lieven, russia, was, formidable, and, was, able, to, back, up, her, diplomatic, policies, with, force, one, of, the, most, significant, factors, in, bringing, russia, to, the, brink, of, war, was, the, downfall, of, her, economy, the, 20, percent, jump, in, defense, expenditure, during, 1866, 77, forced, them, to, change, their, position, within, europe, and, shift, the, balance, of, power, out, of, her, favour, at, the, time, russian, infrastructure, was, backward, and, the, russian, government, had, to, invest, far, more, than, its, european, rivals, in, structural, changes, in, addition, there, were, overwhelming, burdens, of, defense, which, would, ultimately, result, in, an, economic, downfall, for, the, russians, this, was, a, major, strain, on, the, russian, population, but, also, served, as, a, direct, threat, to, military, expenditure, thus, the, only, way, the, russians, could, sustain, the, strains, of, european, war, would, be, to, place, more, emphasis, on, foreign, investment, from, the, french, who, essentially, came, to, russia, s, aid, for, industrial, change, the, franco, russian, alliance, allowed, for, the, russian, defense, to, grow, and, aid, the, european, balance, of, power, during, the, growth, of, the, german, empire, s, might, nevertheless, one, of, the, key, factors, was, that, of, the, russian, foreign, policy, between, 1890, and, 1914, the, russian, army, was, large, but, had, poor, leadership, and, poor, equipment, and, increasingly, poor, morale, until, by, 1917, it, turned, against, the, government, in, order, for, the, russians, to, legitimize, their, war, efforts, the, government, constructed, an, image, of, the, enemy, through, state, instituted, propaganda, their, main, aim, was, to, help, overcome, the, legend, of, the, invincible, german, war, machine, in, order, to, boost, the, morale, of, civilians, and, soldiers, russian, propaganda, often, took, the, form, of, showing, the, germans, as, a, civilized, nation, with, barbaric, inhuman, traits, russian, propaganda, also, exploited, the, image, of, the, russian, pows, who, were, in, the, german, camps, again, in, order, to, boost, the, morale, of, their, troops, serving, as, encouragement, to, defeat, the, enemy, and, to, get, their, fellow, soldiers, out, of, german, pow, camps, that, were, perceived, as, inhumane, an, element, of, the, russian, propaganda, was, the, investigate, commission, formed, in, april, 1915, it, was, led, by, aleksei, krivtsov, and, the, study, was, tasked, with, the, job, of, studying, the, legal, violations, committed, by, of, the, central, powers, and, then, getting, this, information, to, the, russian, public, this, commission, published, photographs, of, letters, that, were, allegedly, found, on, fallen, german, soldiers, these, letters, document, the, german, correspondents, saying, to, take, no, prisoners, a, museum, was, also, set, up, in, petrograd, which, displayed, pictures, that, showed, how, inhumanly, the, germans, were, treating, prisoners, of, war, also, the, russians, chose, to, discard, the, name, saint, petersburg, to, remove, the, german, sounding, saint, and, burg, favouring, the, more, russian, sounding, petrograd, austria, hungary, s, participation, in, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, has, been, neglected, by, historians, as, emphasis, has, traditionally, been, placed, on, germany, s, role, as, the, prime, instigator, however, the, spark, that, ignited, the, first, world, war, is, attributed, to, the, assassination, of, archduke, franz, ferdinand, by, gavrilo, princip, which, took, place, on, 28, june, 1914, approximately, a, month, later, on, 28, july, 1914, austria, hungary, declared, war, on, serbia, this, act, led, to, a, series, of, events, that, would, quickly, expand, into, the, first, world, war, thus, the, habsburg, government, in, vienna, initiated, the, pivotal, decision, that, would, begin, the, conflict, the, causes, of, the, great, war, have, generally, been, defined, in, diplomatic, terms, but, certain, deep, seated, issues, in, austria, hungary, undoubtedly, contributed, to, the, beginnings, of, the, first, world, war, the, austro, hungarian, situation, in, the, balkans, pre, 1914, is, a, primary, factor, in, its, involvement, in, the, war, the, movement, towards, south, slav, unity, was, a, major, problem, for, the, habsburg, empire, which, was, facing, increasing, nationalist, pressure, from, its, multinational, populace, as, europe, s, third, largest, state, the, austro, hungarian, monarchy, was, hardly, homogeneous, comprising, over, fifty, million, people, and, eleven, nationalities, the, empire, was, a, conglomeration, of, a, number, of, diverse, cultures, languages, and, peoples, specifically, the, south, slavic, people, of, austria, hungary, desired, to, amalgamate, with, serbia, in, an, effort, to, officially, solidify, their, shared, cultural, heritage, over, seven, million, south, slavs, lived, inside, the, empire, while, three, million, lived, outside, it, with, the, growing, emergence, of, nationalism, in, the, twentieth, century, unity, of, all, south, slavs, looked, promising, this, tension, is, exemplified, by, conrad, von, h, tzendorf, s, letter, to, franz, ferdinand, the, unification, of, the, south, slav, race, is, one, of, the, powerful, national, movements, which, can, neither, be, ignored, nor, kept, down, the, question, can, only, be, whether, unification, will, take, place, within, the, boundaries, of, the, monarchy, that, is, at, the, expense, of, serbia, s, independence, or, under, serbia, s, leadership, at, the, expense, of, the, monarchy, the, cost, to, the, monarchy, would, be, the, loss, of, its, south, slav, provinces, and, thus, of, almost, its, entire, coastline, the, loss, of, territory, and, prestige, would, relegate, the, monarchy, to, the, status, of, a, small, power, the, annexation, of, bosnia, herzegovina, in, 1908, by, austrian, foreign, minister, baron, von, aehrenthal, in, an, effort, to, assert, domination, over, the, balkans, inflamed, slavic, nationalism, and, angered, serbia, bosnia, herzegovina, became, a, rallying, cry, for, south, slavs, with, hostilities, between, austria, hungary, and, serbia, steadily, increasing, the, situation, was, ripe, for, conflict, and, when, the, serbian, nationalist, gavrilo, princip, assassinated, austrian, imperial, heir, franz, ferdinand, these, longstanding, hostilities, culminated, into, an, all, out, war, the, allied, powers, wholeheartedly, supported, the, slavs, nationalistic, fight, george, macaulay, trevelyan, a, british, historian, saw, serbia, s, war, against, austria, hungary, as, a, war, of, liberation, that, would, free, south, slavs, from, tyranny, in, his, own, words, if, ever, there, was, a, battle, for, freedom, there, is, such, a, battle, now, going, on, in, southeastern, europe, against, austrian, and, magyar, if, this, war, ends, in, the, overthrow, of, the, magyar, tyranny, an, immense, step, forward, will, have, been, taken, toward, racial, liberty, and, european, peace, russians, were, very, patriotic, in, the, period, of, 1914, marches, were, held, where, the, hymns, for, faith, tsar, and, fatherland, were, sung, the, people, believed, in, the, victory, and, strength, of, the, russian, army, this, was, confirmed, by, the, successes, in, galicia, and, poland, however, the, left, socialist, circles, tried, to, inflate, and, split, russian, society, which, they, succeeded, in, 1917, in, the, years, prior, to, 1914, austro, russian, co, operation, was, both, crucial, for, european, peace, and, difficult, to, maintain, old, suspicions, exacerbated, by, the, bosnian, crisis, stood, in, the, way, of, agreement, between, the, two, empires, as, did, ethnic, sensitivities, russia, s, historical, role, as, liberator, of, the, balkans, was, difficult, to, square, with, austria, s, determination, to, control, adjacent, territories, in, 1913, 1914, saint, petersburg, was, too, concerned, with, its, own, weakness, and, what, it, saw, as, threats, to, vital, russian, interests, to, spare, much, thought, for, vienna, s, feelings, the, russians, were, with, some, justice, indignant, that, the, concessions, they, had, made, after, the, first, balkan, war, in, the, interest, of, european, peace, had, not, been, reciprocated, by, the, central, powers, this, was, doubly, dangerous, given, the, growing, evidence, flowing, into, petersburg, about, germany, s, aggressive, intentions, both, bazarov, and, the, agents, of, the, russian, secret, political, police, in, germany, reported, the, concern, aroused, in, public, opinion, by, the, press, war, against, russia, which, raged, in, the, spring, of, 1914, the, russian, military, was, the, largest, in, the, world, consisting, of, 1, 400, 000, men, on, duty, just, prior, to, the, war, they, could, also, mobilize, up, to, 5, million, men, but, only, had, 4, 6, million, rifles, to, give, them, russian, troops, were, satisfactorily, supplied, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, there, was, more, light, artillery, than, france, and, no, less, than, germany, the, russian, command, showed, itself, just, as, well, compared, to, the, western, allies, the, russian, rear, also, proved, itself, the, internal, state, of, russia, was, the, best, in, the, war, hunger, was, not, experienced, anywhere, bread, cards, were, not, introduced, and, per, capita, consumption, even, grew, russia, s, industry, was, also, developing, unlike, austria, hungary, which, was, weakening, every, year, the, first, events, were, the, capture, of, kalish, and, chenhostov, by, the, germans, without, fighting, and, the, first, real, clash, was, clashes, at, wierzbo, w, the, first, full, scale, operation, was, invasion, of, east, prussia, on, 17, august, 1914, and, the, austro, hungarian, province, of, galicia, the, russian, offensive, in, the, battle, of, stallup, nen, which, was, the, opening, battle, of, the, eastern, front, quickly, turned, to, a, disastrous, defeat, following, the, battle, of, tannenberg, in, august, 1914, even, though, the, russians, were, successfully, defending, at, gumbinnen, a, while, before, tannenberg, after, the, russian, disaster, german, troops, under, the, command, of, hindenburg, inflicted, another, crushing, defeat, on, the, numerically, superior, russian, army, in, the, first, battle, of, the, masurian, lakes, a, second, russian, incursion, into, galicia, was, more, successful, with, the, russians, controlling, almost, all, of, that, region, by, the, end, of, 1914, routing, four, austrian, armies, in, the, process, under, the, command, of, nikolai, ivanov, nikolai, ruzsky, and, aleksei, brusilov, the, russians, won, the, battle, of, galicia, in, september, and, began, the, siege, of, przemy, l, the, next, fortress, on, the, road, towards, krak, w, this, early, russian, success, in, 1914, on, the, austro, russian, border, was, a, reason, for, concern, to, the, central, powers, and, caused, considerable, german, forces, to, be, transferred, to, the, east, to, take, pressure, off, the, austrians, leading, to, the, creation, of, the, new, german, ninth, army, the, austro, hungarian, government, accepted, the, polish, proposal, of, establishing, the, supreme, national, committee, as, the, polish, central, authority, within, the, empire, responsible, for, the, formation, of, the, polish, legions, an, auxiliary, military, formation, within, the, austro, hungarian, army, at, the, end, of, 1914, the, main, focus, of, the, fighting, shifted, to, central, part, of, russian, poland, west, of, the, river, vistula, the, october, battle, of, the, vistula, river, augustow, operation, and, the, november, battle, of, d, they, brought, the, germans, only, huge, losses, and, the, strengthening, of, the, russians, in, the, region, germans, initial, plans, to, destroy, the, russians, in, poland, ended, in, desperate, attempts, to, prevent, their, invasion, of, silesia, the, russian, and, austro, hungarian, armies, continued, to, clash, along, the, carpathian, front, throughout, the, winter, of, 1914, 1915, przemysl, fortress, managed, to, hold, out, deep, behind, enemy, lines, throughout, this, period, with, the, russians, bypassing, it, in, order, to, attack, the, austro, hungarian, troops, further, to, the, west, they, made, some, progress, crossing, the, carpathian, mountains, in, february, and, march, 1915, but, then, the, german, relief, helped, the, austrians, stop, further, russian, advances, in, the, meantime, przemysl, was, almost, entirely, destroyed, and, the, siege, of, przemysl, ended, in, a, defeat, for, the, austrians, in, 1915, the, chief, of, german, great, general, staff, general, of, infantry, erich, von, falkenhayn, decided, to, make, its, main, effort, on, the, eastern, front, and, accordingly, transferred, considerable, forces, there, the, year, began, with, a, successful, german, offensive, in, the, area, of, the, masurian, lakes, at, the, same, time, a, large, battle, for, the, city, of, przasnysz, took, place, on, the, polish, front, the, city, changed, hands, several, times, but, eventually, remained, in, russian, hands, as, a, result, of, the, battle, the, germans, lost, from, 38, 000, to, 60, 000, soldiers, and, russian, losses, amounted, to, about, 40, 000, men, in, may, 1915, to, eliminate, the, russian, threat, the, central, powers, began, the, successful, gorlice, tarn, w, offensive, in, galicia, after, the, second, battle, of, the, masurian, lakes, the, german, and, austro, hungarian, troops, on, the, eastern, front, functioned, under, a, unified, command, the, offensive, soon, turned, into, a, general, advance, and, a, corresponding, strategic, retreat, by, the, russian, army, the, cause, of, the, reverses, suffered, by, the, russian, army, despite, a, significant, numerical, superiority, over, the, german, enemy, was, not, so, many, errors, in, the, tactical, sphere, as, the, deficiency, in, technical, equipment, particularly, in, artillery, and, ammunition, as, well, as, the, corruption, and, incompetence, of, the, russian, officers, only, by, 1916, did, the, buildup, of, russian, war, industries, increase, the, production, of, war, material, and, improve, the, supply, situation, by, mid, 1915, the, russians, had, been, expelled, from, russian, poland, the, whole, campaign, cost, the, russians, about, 400, 000, people, however, the, germans, and, austrians, suffered, setbacks, their, attempt, to, break, through, to, lublin, was, repulsed, with, losses, of, 37, 500, people, the, russians, lost, 9, 524, people, and, hence, pushed, hundreds, of, kilometers, away, from, the, borders, of, the, central, powers, removing, the, threat, of, russian, invasion, of, germany, although, there, was, still, slight, russian, penetration, into, austria, hungary, at, the, end, of, 1915, the, german, austrian, advance, was, stopped, on, the, line, riga,

the, russian, empire, lost, the, entire, line, of, western, fortresses, and, more, than, 4, 000, guns, the, causes, of, heavy, defeats, and, losses, of, personnel, weapons, and, as, a, result, vast, territories, the, entire, kingdom, of, poland, part, of, the, baltic, states, grodno, partly, volhynia, and, podolia, provinces, up, to, 300, 000, square, kilometers, were, to, a, large, extent, systemic, shortcomings, in, the, management, of, the, armed, forces, and, the, defense, industry, the, multi, stage, placement, of, military, orders, their, slow, passage, in, the, depths, of, the, war, ministry, the, disunity, of, the, front, and, rear, played, a, negative, role, thus, until, the, autumn, of, 1915, the, russian, supreme, commander, in, chief, only, coordinated, the, actions, of, the, commanders, in, chief, of, the, armies, of, the, fronts, distributed, reinforcements, requesting, them, from, the, war, ministry, the, minister, of, war, was, responsible, for, organizing, the, production, of, weapons, and, ammunition, the, implementation, of, the, replenishment, of, troop, personnel, military, transportation, outside, the, provinces, declared, a, theater, of, military, operations, the, military, districts, in, the, theater, of, operations, were, subordinate, to, the, commanders, in, chief, of, the, armies, of, the, fronts, but, not, to, the, headquarters, military, production, also, lagged, behind, until, the, end, of, autumn, the, active, army, suffered, from, a, shortage, of, rifles, and, ammunition, the, consumption, of, which, turned, out, to, be, incommensurable, with, the, volume, of, production, contemporaries, also, noted, the, isolation, of, the, russian, commanding, staff, from, the, soldiers, the, lack, of, practical, warfare, skills, among, the, top, level, commanders, we, did, have, courage, to, send, people, to, mass, slaughter, hiding, behind, the, difficulty, of, tactical, responsibility, to, slaughter, often, without, purpose, we, sent, them, being, ourselves, far, away, not, seeing, either, our, own, or, the, enemy, and, therefore, not, conforming, to, reality, instead, of, punishment, we, reward, such, leaders, because, as, far, as, the, leaders, were, far, away, the, same, but, still, more, the, higher, leaders, kept, even, more, distant, people, ceased, to, be, people, but, turned, into, pawns, we, went, to, the, fight, in, a, state, of, some, kind, of, oblivion, and, stunnedness, wrote, the, representative, of, the, supreme, commander, in, chief, infantry, general, fyodor, palitzin, in, his, diary, failures, in, the, russian, system, of, command, and, control, of, troops, and, the, organization, of, hostilities, occurred, at, other, levels, thus, serious, shortcomings, in, reconnaissance, led, to, the, absence, of, any, analysis, of, the, enemy, s, plans, and, actions, with, a, general, superiority, in, forces, almost, every, central, powers, s, operation, in, 1915, was, unexpected, for, the, command, from, the, front, to, the, regimental, level, passion, for, undercover, intelligence, in, the, highest, russian, headquarters, did, not, justify, itself, and, tactical, intelligence, was, still, based, on, barely, reliable, testimony, of, prisoners, in, the, absence, of, which, the, command, up, to, the, army, inclusive, was, simply, blind, the, separation, of, artillery, from, infantry, with, subordination, to, the, inspectors, of, the, corps, and, ammunition, supply, units, park, brigades, and, divisions, created, difficulties, in, the, operational, replenishment, of, ammunition, and, shells, in, the, combat, units, at, the, same, time, huge, stockpiles, of, ammunition, were, created, in, the, fortresses, which, were, then, delivered, to, the, enemy, during, the, retreat, or, destroyed, due, to, the, impossibility, of, evacuation, special, units, were, not, created, for, the, construction, of, fortifications, in, the, rear, of, the, troops, most, often, such, work, was, hastily, carried, out, by, militia, squads, and, the, mobilized, local, population, sometimes, including, women, and, then, brought, to, the, necessary, defensive, state, by, the, combat, units, retreating, on, them, already, exhausted, by, battles, and, night, marches, the, country, s, geographic, expanses, and, a, large, population, again, became, the, salvation, of, the, russia, from, complete, military, defeat, however, by, the, end, of, the, 1915, campaign, it, became, obvious, that, without, a, radical, restructuring, of, the, war, strategy, methods, of, managing, military, potential, victory, becomes, unattainable, and, new, defeats, can, cause, another, collapse, of, transport, as, in, the, case, of, mass, exodus, and, the, hasty, evacuation, of, the, western, provinces, supplies, public, administration, and, as, a, result, the, aggravation, of, the, struggle, for, power, in, the, country, nevertheless, as, before, for, the, military, leadership, of, the, russian, empire, there, was, only, one, way, to, victory, the, numerical, superiority, over, the, germans, to, some, extent, the, russian, side, in, the, autumn, played, along, with, e, von, falkenhayn, who, not, considering, the, russian, direction, to, have, at, least, some, strategic, prospect, for, achieving, victory, in, the, war, made, it, impossible, to, develop, the, offensive, of, the, eastern, front, after, the, battle, of, sarikamish, the, russo, turkish, front, quickly, turned, in, favor, of, russian, forces, the, turks, were, concerned, with, reorganizing, their, army, and, also, fighting, the, massive, allied, armada, that, landed, in, galipoli, meanwhile, russia, was, preoccupied, with, other, armies, on, the, eastern, front, however, the, appointment, of, grand, duke, nicholas, nikolaevich, as, viceroy, and, commander, in, the, caucasus, in, september, 1915, revived, the, situation, of, the, russo, turkish, front, when, the, allies, withdrew, from, gallipoli, in, december, the, caucasus, army, s, chief, of, staff, general, nikolai, yudenich, believed, turkish, forces, would, take, action, against, his, army, this, concern, was, legitimate, bulgaria, s, entry, into, the, war, as, germany, s, ally, in, october, caused, serious, alarm, as, a, land, route, from, germany, to, turkey, was, now, open, and, would, allow, for, an, unrestricted, flow, of, german, weapons, to, the, turks, a, window, of, opportunity, appeared, that, would, allow, the, russians, to, destroy, the, turkish, third, army, as, the, british, required, assistance, in, mesopotamia, now, modern, day, iraq, britain, s, efforts, to, besiege, baghdad, had, been, halted, at, ctesiphon, and, they, were, forced, to, retreat, this, led, to, an, increasing, number, of, attacks, by, turkish, forces, the, british, requested, the, russians, to, attack, in, an, attempt, to, distract, the, turks, and, yudenich, agreed, the, resulting, offensive, began, on, 10, january, 1916, this, offensive, was, unanticipated, by, the, turks, as, it, was, in, the, middle, of, winter, the, turkish, situation, was, exacerbated, by, the, absences, of, third, army, s, commander, kamil, pasha, and, chief, of, staff, major, guse, coupled, with, an, imbalance, of, forces, the, russians, had, 325, 000, troops, while, the, turks, only, 78, 000, the, situation, appeared, grim, for, the, central, powers, after, three, months, of, fighting, the, russians, captured, the, city, of, trabzon, on, 18, april, 1916, allied, operations, in, 1916, were, dictated, by, an, urgent, need, to, force, germany, to, transfer, forces, from, its, western, to, eastern, fronts, to, relieve, the, pressure, on, the, french, at, the, battle, of, verdun, this, was, to, be, accomplished, by, a, series, of, russian, offensives, which, would, force, the, germans, to, deploy, additional, forces, to, counter, them, the, first, such, operation, was, the, lake, naroch, offensive, in, march, april, 1916, the, germans, repulsed, the, attacks, but, the, offensive, achieved, its, main, goal, the, germans, stopped, the, attack, on, verdun, giving, the, french, a, break, the, italian, operations, during, 1916, had, one, extraordinary, result, austrian, divisions, were, pulled, away, from, the, russian, southern, front, this, allowed, the, russian, forces, to, organize, a, counter, offensive, the, brusilov, offensive, was, a, large, tactical, assault, carried, out, by, russian, forces, against, austro, hungarian, forces, in, galicia, general, aleksei, brusilov, believed, victory, against, the, central, powers, was, possible, if, close, attention, was, paid, to, preparation, brusilov, suggested, that, the, russians, should, attack, on, a, wide, front, and, to, position, their, trenches, a, mere, 75, yards, 69, m, away, from, austrian, trenches, brusilov, s, plan, worked, impeccably, the, russians, outnumbered, the, austrians, 200, 000, to, 150, 000, and, held, a, considerable, advantage, in, guns, with, 904, large, guns, to, 600, most, importantly, innovative, new, tactics, similar, to, those, independently, invented, by, erwin, rommel, were, used, to, perform, quick, and, effective, close, range, surprise, attacks, that, allowed, a, steady, advance, the, russian, eighth, army, overwhelmed, the, austrian, fourth, and, pushed, on, to, lutsk, advancing, 40, miles, 64, km, beyond, the, starting, position, over, a, million, austrians, were, lost, with, over, 500, 000, men, killed, or, taken, prisoner, by, mid, june, although, the, brusilov, offensive, was, initially, successful, it, slowed, down, considerably, an, inadequate, number, of, troops, and, poorly, maintained, supply, lines, hindered, brusilov, s, ability, to, follow, up, on, the, initial, victories, in, june, the, brusilov, offensive, is, considered, to, be, the, greatest, russian, victory, of, the, first, world, war, 52, although, it, cost, the, russians, half, a, million, casualties, during, the, first, two, months, alone, the, offensive, successfully, diverted, substantial, forces, of, the, central, powers, from, the, western, front, and, persuaded, romania, to, join, the, war, diverting, even, more, central, powers, forces, to, the, east, a, series, of, failures, in, 1915, gave, the, russians, time, to, reconfigure, industry, for, wartime, and, they, did, it, successfully, russian, industry, began, to, overtake, austrian, in, terms, of, growth, rates, and, eventually, increased, the, productivity, of, ammunition, several, times, here, is, what, information, was, announced, at, the, duma, meeting, the, production, of, rifles, doubled, the, production, of, machine, guns, increased, 6, times, the, production, of, light, guns, increased, 9, times, the, production, of, artillery, shells, increased, 40, times, the, production, of, heavy, artillery, increased, 4, times, and, finally, the, production, of, aircraft, increased, 4, times, it, is, no, exaggeration, to, say, that, roumania, may, be, the, turning, point, of, the, campaign, if, the, germans, fail, there, it, will, be, the, greatest, disaster, inflicted, upon, them, afterwards, it, will, only, be, a, question, of, time, but, should, germany, succeed, i, hesitate, to, think, what, the, effect, will, be, on, the, fortunes, of, the, campaign, and, yet, no, one, seems, to, have, thought, it, his, particular, duty, to, prepare, a, plan, up, until, 1916, the, romanians, followed, the, tides, of, war, with, interest, while, attempting, to, situate, themselves, in, the, most, advantageous, position, french, and, russian, diplomats, had, begun, courting, the, romanians, early, on, but, persuasion, tactics, gradually, intensified, for, king, ferdinand, to, commit, his, force, of, half, a, million, men, he, expected, the, allies, to, offer, a, substantial, incentive, playing, on, romanian, anti, hungarian, sentiment, the, allies, promised, the, austria, hungarian, territory, of, ardeal, transylvania, to, romania, transylvanian, demographics, strongly, favoured, the, romanians, romania, succumbed, to, allied, enticement, on, 18, august, 1916, nine, days, later, on, 27, august, romanian, troops, marched, into, transylvania, romania, s, entry, into, the, war, provoked, major, strategic, changes, for, the, germans, in, september, 1916, german, troops, were, mobilized, to, the, eastern, front, additionally, the, german, chief, of, the, general, staff, general, erich, von, falkenhayn, was, forced, to, resign, from, office, though, his, successor, appointed, him, to, command, the, combined, central, powers, forces, against, romania, along, with, general, august, von, mackensen, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, immediately, replaced, falkenhayn, with, paul, von, hindenburg, von, hindenburg, s, deputy, the, more, adept, erich, ludendorff, was, given, effective, control, of, the, army, and, ordered, to, advance, on, romania, on, 3, september, the, first, troops, of, the, central, powers, marched, into, romanian, territory, simultaneously, the, bulgarian, air, force, commenced, an, incessant, bombing, of, bucharest, in, an, attempt, to, relieve, some, pressure, french, and, british, forces, launched, a, new, offensive, known, as, the, battle, of, the, somme, while, the, brusilov, offensive, continued, in, the, east, it, is, certain, that, so, relatively, small, a, state, as, rumania, had, never, before, been, given, a, role, so, important, and, indeed, so, decisive, for, the, history, of, the, world, at, so, favorable, a, moment, never, before, had, two, great, powers, like, germany, and, austria, found, themselves, so, much, at, the, mercy, of, the, military, resources, of, a, country, which, had, scarcely, one, twentieth, of, the, population, of, the, two, great, states, judging, by, the, military, situation, it, was, to, be, expected, that, rumania, had, only, to, advance, where, she, wished, to, decide, the, world, war, in, favor, of, those, powers, which, had, been, hurling, themselves, at, us, in, vain, for, years, thus, everything, seemed, to, depend, on, whether, rumania, was, ready, to, make, any, sort, of, use, of, her, momentary, advantage, the, entrance, of, romania, into, the, war, was, disconcerting, for, von, hindenburg, on, 15, september, paul, von, hindenburg, issued, the, following, order, stating, that, the, main, task, of, the, armies, is, now, to, hold, fast, all, positions, on, the, western, eastern, italian, and, macedonian, fronts, and, to, employ, all, other, available, forces, against, rumania, fortunately, for, the, central, powers, the, quantity, and, quality, of, the, romanian, army, was, overestimated, although, numbering, half, a, million, men, the, romanian, army, suffered, from, poor, training, and, a, lack, of, appropriate, equipment, the, initial, success, of, the, romanian, army, in, austria, hungarian, territory, was, quickly, undermined, by, the, central, powers, german, and, austro, hungarian, troops, advanced, from, the, north, while, bulgarian, turkish, german, forces, marched, into, romania, from, the, south, although, thought, to, be, a, tactical, blunder, by, contemporaries, the, romanians, opted, to, mount, operations, in, both, directions, by, the, middle, of, november, the, german, force, passed, through, the, carpathians, suffering, significant, casualties, due, to, determined, romanian, resistance, by, 5, december, bulgarian, troops, had, crossed, the, danube, and, were, approaching, the, capital, bucharest, at, the, same, time, as, the, austro, hungarian, troops, moved, east, and, as, the, bulgarians, marched, north, the, turks, had, sent, in, two, army, divisions, by, sea, to, the, dobruja, from, the, east, eventually, the, romanian, forces, were, pushed, back, behind, the, siret, in, northern, moldavia, they, received, help, from, the, allies, notably, from, france, which, sent, a, military, mission, of, more, than, a, thousand, officers, health, and, support, staff, the, act, of, 5, november, 1916, was, proclaimed, then, to, the, poles, jointly, by, the, emperors, wilhelm, ii, of, germany, and, franz, joseph, of, austria, hungary, this, act, promised, the, creation, of, the, kingdom, of, poland, out, of, territory, of, congress, poland, envisioned, by, its, authors, as, a, puppet, state, controlled, by, the, central, powers, the, origin, of, that, document, was, the, dire, need, to, draft, new, recruits, from, german, occupied, poland, for, the, war, with, russia, following, the, armistice, of, 11, november, 1918, ending, the, world, war, i, in, spite, of, the, previous, initial, total, dependence, of, the, kingdom, on, its, sponsors, it, ultimately, served, against, their, intentions, as, the, cornerstone, proto, state, of, the, nascent, second, polish, republic, the, latter, composed, also, of, territories, never, intended, by, the, central, powers, to, be, ceded, to, poland, by, january, 1917, the, ranks, of, the, romanian, army, had, been, significantly, thinned, roughly, 150, 000, romanian, soldiers, had, been, taken, prisoner, 200, 000, men, were, dead, or, wounded, and, lost, two, thirds, of, their, country, including, the, capital, importantly, the, ploie, ti, oilfields, the, only, significant, source, of, oil, in, europe, west, of, the, black, sea, had, been, destroyed, before, they, were, abandoned, to, the, central, powers, the, russian, february, revolution, aimed, to, topple, the, russian, monarchy, and, resulted, in, the, creation, of, the, provisional, government, the, revolution, was, a, turning, point, in, russian, history, and, its, significance, and, influence, can, still, be, felt, in, many, countries, today, although, many, russians, wanted, a, revolution, no, one, had, expected, it, to, happen, when, it, did, let, alone, how, it, did, on, international, women, s, day, thursday, 23, february, 1917, 8, march, 1917, as, many, as, 90, 000, female, workers, in, the, city, of, petrograd, left, their, factory, jobs, and, marched, through, the, streets, shouting, bread, down, with, the, autocracy, and, stop, the, war, these, women, were, tired, hungry, and, angry, after, working, long, hours, in, miserable, conditions, to, feed, their, families, because, their, menfolk, were, fighting, at, the, front, they, were, not, alone, in, demanding, change, more, than, 150, 000, men, and, women, took, to, the, streets, to, protest, the, next, day, by, saturday, 25, february, the, city, of, petrograd, was, essentially, shut, down, no, one, was, allowed, to, work, or, wanted, to, work, even, though, there, were, a, few, incidents, of, police, and, soldiers, firing, into, the, crowds, those, groups, soon, mutinied, and, joined, the, protesters, tsar, nicholas, ii, who, was, not, in, petrograd, during, the, revolution, heard, reports, of, the, protests, but, chose, not, to, take, them, seriously, by, 1, march, it, was, obvious, to, everyone, except, the, tsar, himself, that, his, rule, was, over, on, 2, march, it, was, made, official, from, this, point, onwards, russia, was, administered, by, the, russian, provisional, government, until, the, october, revolution, in, early, july, 1917, on, a, relatively, small, area, of, the, romanian, front, there, began, one, of, the, largest, concentrations, of, combat, forces, and, means, known, during, the, conflagration, nine, armies, 80, infantry, divisions, with, 974, battalions, 19, cavalry, divisions, with, 550, squadrons, and, 923, artillery, batteries, in, total, they, numbered, some, 800, 000, men, with, about, one, million, in, their, immediate, reserve, between, late, july, and, early, september, the, romanian, army, fought, the, battles, of, m, r, ti, m, r, e, ti, and, oituz, managing, to, stop, the, german, austro, hungarian, advance, inflicting, heavy, losses, in, the, process, and, winning, the, most, important, allied, victories, on, the, eastern, front, in, 1917, as, a, result, of, these, operations, the, remaining, romanian, territories, remained, unoccupied, tying, down, nearly, 1, 000, 000, central, powers, troops, and, prompting, the, times, to, describe, the, romanian, front, as, the, only, point, of, light, in, the, east, on, 29, june, 1917, alexander, kerensky, the, minister, of, war, in, the, russian, provisional, government, launched, the, kerensky, offensive, to, end, austria, hungary, once, and, for, all, the, russians, made, only, 6, miles, 9, 7, km, of, progress, but, the, austrians, counterattacked, and, drove, them, almost, entirely, out, of, austria, hungary, and, they, retreated, 150, miles, 240, km, losing, tarnopol, stanislau, and, czernowitz, this, defeat, was, accompanied, by, 60, 000, casualties, and, contributed, greatly, to, the, collapse, of, the, russian, army, during, the, october, revolution, although, the, february, revolution, had, overthrown, the, tsar, the, bolsheviks, still, were, not, satisfied, in, their, view, the, new, provisional, government, was, merely, a, more, deceptive, continuation, of, the, previous, government, they, still, refused, to, withdraw, from, the, war, despite, how, badly, it, was, going, the, upper, class, still, wielded, considerable, influence, in, russian, economics, and, politics, so, by, september, 1917, lenin, began, advocating, for, a, second, revolution, one, that, would, allow, the, workers, and, peasants, to, gain, total, control, over, the, country, the, central, committee, of, the, bolshevik, party, convened, on, 10, october, and, after, much, heated, debate, agreed, that, it, was, time, to, begin, planning, for, an, armed, insurrection, troops, who, were, loyal, to, the, bolsheviks, took, control, of, the, telegraph, stations, power, stations, strategic, bridges, post, offices, train, stations, and, state, banks, petrograd, was, officially, in, the, hands, of, the, bolsheviks, who, greatly, increased, their, organization, in, factory, groups, and, in, many, barracks, throughout, petrograd, they, concentrated, on, devising, a, plan, for, overturning, the, provisional, government, with, a, coup, d, tat, on, 24, october, lenin, emerged, from, hiding, in, a, suburb, entered, the, city, set, up, his, headquarters, at, the, smolny, institute, and, worked, to, complete, his, three, phase, plan, with, the, main, bridges, and, the, main, railways, secured, only, the, winter, palace, and, with, it, the, provisional, government, remained, to, be, taken, on, the, evening, of, 7, november, the, troops, that, were, loyal, to, the, bolsheviks, infiltrated, the, winter, palace, after, an, almost, bloodless, coup, the, bolsheviks, were, the, new, leaders, of, russia, lenin, announced, that, the, new, bolshevik, government, would, immediately, be, seeking, an, end, to, the, war, implementing, a, system, of, worker, s, democracy, and, establishing, collective, ownership, of, all, farms, and, factories, lenin, s, new, bolshevik, government, tried, to, end, the, war, with, a, ceasefire, being, declared, on, 15, december, 1917, along, lines, agreed, in, november, at, the, same, time, the, bolsheviks, launched, a, full, scale, military, offensive, against, its, opponents, ukraine, and, separatist, governments, in, the, don, region, during, the, peace, negotiations, between, the, soviets, and, the, central, powers, the, germans, demanded, enormous, concessions, eventually, resulting, in, the, failure, of, the, long, drawn, out, peace, negotiations, on, 17, february, 1918, at, the, same, time, the, central, powers, concluded, a, military, treaty, with, ukraine, which, was, losing, ground, in, the, fight, with, invading, bolshevik, forces, the, russian, civil, war, which, started, just, after, november, 1917, would, tear, apart, russia, for, three, years, as, a, result, of, the, events, in, 1917, many, groups, opposed, to, lenin, s, bolsheviks, had, formed, with, the, fall, of, nicholas, ii, many, parts, of, the, russian, empire, took, the, opportunity, to, declare, their, independence, one, of, which, was, finland, which, did, so, in, december, 1917, however, finland, too, collapsed, into, a, civil, war, finland, declared, itself, independent, on, 6, december, 1917, and, this, was, accepted, by, lenin, a, month, later, the, finnish, parliament, elected, a, german, prince, as, king, of, finland, however, the, socialists, the, reds, and, the, whites, in, finland, fell, into, war, with, each, other, in, january, 1918, the, reds, wanted, finland, to, be, a, soviet, republic, and, were, aided, by, russian, forces, still, in, finland, the, whites, of, finland, were, led, by, general, c, g, e, mannerheim, a, finnish, baron, who, had, been, in, the, tsar, s, service, since, he, was, 15, years, old, the, whites, were, also, offered, help, by, a, german, expeditionary, corps, led, by, german, general, goltz, though, mannerheim, never, accepted, the, offer, the, german, corps, landed, in, finland, in, april, 1918, after, the, disintegration, of, the, russian, imperial, army, and, navy, in, 1917, the, council, of, people, s, commissars, headed, by, leon, trotsky, set, about, creating, a, new, army, by, a, decree, on, 28, january, 1918, the, council, created, the, workers, and, peoples, red, army, it, began, recruitment, on, a, voluntary, basis, but,

population, 54, of, its, industrial, land, 89, of, its, coalfields, and, 26, of, its, railroads, the, total, losses, in, land, amounted, to, 1, million, square, kilometers, lenin, bitterly, called, the, settlement, that, abyss, of, defeat, dismemberment, enslavement, and, humiliation, while, the, treaty, was, practically, obsolete, before, the, end, of, the, year, it, did, provide, some, relief, to, the, bolsheviks, who, were, embroiled, in, a, civil, war, and, affirmed, the, independence, of, ukraine, however, estonia, and, latvia, were, intended, to, become, a, united, baltic, duchy, to, be, ruled, by, german, princes, and, german, nobility, as, fiefdoms, under, the, german, kaiser, a, rump, polish, state, was, also, foreseen, on, the, formerly, russian, territories, finland, s,

may, 1918, romania, signed, the, treaty, of, bucharest, with, the, central, powers, which, recognised, romanian, sovereignty, over, bessarabia, in, return, for, ceding, control, of, passes, in, the, carpathian, mountains, to, austria, hungary, and, granting, oil, concessions, to, germany, although, approved, by, parliament, ferdinand, i, refused, to, sign, the, treaty, hoping, for, an, allied, victory, romania, re, entered, the, war, on, 10, november, 1918, on, the, side, of, the, allies, and, the, treaty, of, bucharest, was, formally, annulled, by, the, armistice, of, 11, november, 1918, between, 1914, and, 1918, an, estimated, 400, 000, to, 600, 000, ethnic, romanians, served, with, the, austro, hungarian, army, of, whom, up, to, 150, 000, were, killed, in, action, total, military, and, civilian, deaths, within, contemporary, romanian, borders, are, estimated, at, 748, 000, the, germans, were, able, to, repair, the, oil, fields, around, ploie, ti, and, by, the, end, of, the, war, had, pumped, a, million, tons, of, oil, they, also, requisitioned, two, million, tons, of, grain, from, romanian, farmers, these, materials, were, vital, in, keeping, germany, in, the, war, to, the, end, of, 1918, with, the, end, of, major, combat, on, the, eastern, front, the, germans, were, able, to, transfer, substantial, forces, to, the, west, in, order, to, mount, an, offensive, in, france, in, the, spring, of, 1918, this, offensive, on, the, western, front, failed, to, achieve, a, decisive, breakthrough, and, the, arrival, of, more, and, more, american, units, in, europe, was, sufficient, to, offset, the, german, advantage, even, after, the, russian, collapse, about, a, million, german, soldiers, remained, tied, up, in, the, east, until, the, end, of, the, war, attempting, to, run, a, short, lived, addition, to, the, german, empire, in, europe, in, the, end, the, central, powers, had, to, relinquish, all, of, their, captured, lands, on, the, eastern, front, with, germany, even, being, forced, to, cede, territory, they, held, before, the, war, under, various, treaties, such, as, the, treaty, of, versailles, signed, after, the, armistice, in, 1918, although, the, allied, powers, victory, led, to, the, central, powers, being, forced, to, cancel, the, treaty, signed, with, russia, the, victors, were, at, the, time, intervening, in, the, russian, civil, war, causing, bad, relations, between, russia, and, the, allied, powers, for, versailles, peace, brest, peace, was, canceled, as, well, as, reserved, the, rights, of, russia, to, demand, reparations,

against, the, baltic, states, belarus, and, ukraine, romania, formally, rejoined, the, war, a, day, before, its, end, in, the, west, soon, followed, by, conflict, with, newly, independent, hungary, in, comparison, to, the, attention, directed, to, the, role, played, by, women, on, the, western, front, during, the, first, world, war, the, role, of, women, in, the, east, has, garnered, limited, scholarly, focus, it, is, estimated, that, 20, percent, of, the, russian, industrial, working, class, was, conscripted, into, the, army, therefore, women, s, share, of, industrial, jobs, increased, dramatically, there, were, percentage, increases, in, every, industry, but, the, most, noticeable, increase, happened, in, industrial, labour, which, increased, from, 31, 4, percent, in, 1913, to, 45, percent, in, 1918, women, also, fought, on, the, eastern, front, in, the, later, stages, of, russia, s, participation, in, the, war, russia, began, forming, all, woman, combat, units, the, women, s, battalions, in, part, to, fight, plummeting, morale, among, male, soldiers, by, demonstrating, russian, women, s, willingness, to, fight, in, romania, ecaterina, teodoroiu, actively, fought, in, the, romanian, army, and, is, remembered, today, as, a, national, hero, british, nursing, efforts, were, not, limited, to, the, western, front, nicknamed, the, gray, partridges, in, reference, to, their, dark, gray, overcoats, scottish, volunteer, nurses, arrived, in, romania, in, 1916, under, the, leadership, of, elsie, inglis, in, addition, to, nursing, injured, personnel, scottish, nurses, manned, transport, vehicles, and, acted, as, regimental, cooks, the, gray, partridges, were, well, respected, by, romanian, serbian, and, russian, troops, and, as, a, result, the, romanian, press, went, as, far, as, to, characterize, them, as, healthy, masculine, and, tanned, women, as, a, testament, to, her, abilities, elsie, inglis, and, her, volunteers, were, entrusted, to, turn, an, abandoned, building, in, the, city, of, gala, i, into, an, operational, hospital, which, they, did, in, a, little, more, than, a, day, yvonne, fitzroy, s, published, journal, with, the, scottish, nurses, in, roumania, provides, an, excellent, first, hand, account, of, scottish, nursing, activities, in, the, eastern, front, during, world, war, i, approximately, 200, 000, german, soldiers, and, 2, 5, million, soldiers, from, the, austro, hungarian, army, entered, russian, captivity, during, the, 1914, russian, campaign, the, russians, began, taking, thousands, of, austrian, prisoners, as, a, result, the, russian, authorities, made, emergency, facilities, in, kiev, penza, kazan, and, later, turkestan, to, hold, the, austrian, prisoners, of, war, as, the, war, continued, russia, began, to, detain, soldiers, from, germany, as, well, as, a, growing, number, from, the, austro, hungarian, army, the, tsarist, state, saw, the, large, population, of, pows, as, a, workforce, that, could, benefit, the, war, economy, in, russia, many, pows, were, employed, as, farm, laborers, and, miners, in, donbas, and, krivoi, rog, however, the, majority, of, pows, were, employed, as, laborers, constructing, canals, and, building, railroads, the, living, and, working, environments, for, these, pows, was, bleak, there, was, a, shortage, of, food, clean, drinking, water, and, proper, medical, care, during, the, summer, months, malaria, was, a, major, problem, and, the, malnutrition, among, the, pows, led, to, many, cases, of, scurvy, while, working, on, the, murmansk, rail, building, project, over, 25, 000, pows, died, information, about, the, bleak, conditions, of, the, labor, camps, reached, the, german, and, austro, hungarian, governments, they, began, to, complain, about, the, treatment, of, pows, the, tsarist, authorities, initially, refused, to, acknowledge, the, german, and, habsburg, governments, they, rejected, their, claims, because, russian, pows, were, working, on, railway, construction, in, serbia, however, they, slowly, agreed, to, stop, using, prison, labor, life, in, the, camps, was, extremely, rough, for, the, men, who, resided, in, them, the, tsarist, government, could, not, provide, adequate, supplies, for, the, men, living, in, their, pow, camps, the, russian, government, s, inability, to, supply, the, pows, in, their, camps, with, supplies, was, due, to, inadequate, resources, and, bureaucratic, rivalries, however, the, conditions, in, the, pow, camps, varied, some, were, more, bearable, than, others, the, attitude, towards, russian, prisoners, from, the, central, powers, was, even, worse, in, some, camps, the, mattress, was, for, 4, people, and, in, others, people, were, starved, on, purpose, at, the, beginning, of, 1915, a, case, was, recorded, of, three, prisoners, being, forced, to, run, around, the, camp, without, stopping, in, parallel, they, were, stabbed, with, bayonets, and, beaten, disease, played, a, critical, role, in, the, loss, of, life, on, the, eastern, front, in, the, east, disease, accounted, for, approximately, four, times, the, number, of, deaths, caused, by, direct, combat, in, contrast, to, the, three, to, one, ratio, in, the, west, malaria, cholera, and, dysentery, contributed, to, the, epidemiological, crisis, on, the, eastern, front, however, typhus, fever, transmitted, by, pathogenic, lice, and, previously, unknown, to, german, medical, officers, before, the, outbreak, of, the, war, was, the, most, deadly, there, was, a, direct, correlation, between, the, environmental, conditions, of, the, east, and, the, prevalence, of, disease, with, cities, excessively, crowded, by, refugees, fleeing, their, native, countries, unsanitary, medical, conditions, created, a, suitable, environment, for, diseases, to, spread, primitive, hygienic, conditions, along, with, general, lack, of, knowledge, about, proper, medical, care, was, evident, in, the, german, occupied, ober, ost, ultimately, a, large, scale, sanitation, program, was, put, into, effect, this, program, named, sanitit, tswesen, medical, affairs, was, responsible, for, ensuring, proper, hygienic, procedures, were, being, carried, out, in, latvia, lithuania, and, poland, quarantine, centers, were, built, and, diseased, neighbourhoods, were, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, population, delousing, stations, were, prevalent, in, the, countryside, and, in, cities, to, prevent, the, spread, of, typhus, fever, with, mass, numbers, of, natives, being, forced, to, take, part, in, this, process, at, military, bathhouses, a, sanitary, police, was, also, introduced, to, confirm, the, cleanliness, of, homes, and, any, home, deemed, unfit, would, be, boarded, up, with, a, warning, sign, dogs, and, cats, were, also, killed, for, fear, of, possible, infection, to, avoid, the, spread, of, disease, prostitution, became, regulated, prostitutes, were, required, to, register, for, a, permit, and, authorities, demanded, mandatory, medical, examinations, for, all, prostitutes, estimating, that, seventy, percent, of, prostitutes, carried, a, venereal, disease, military, brothels, were, introduced, to, combat, disease, the, city, of, kowno, emphasized, proper, educational, use, of, contraceptives, such, as, condoms, encouraged, proper, cleansing, of, the, genital, area, after, intercourse, and, gave, instructions, on, treatment, in, the, case, of, infection, the, russian, casualties, in, the, first, world, war, are, difficult, to, estimate, due, to, the, poor, quality, of, available, statistics, cornish, gives, a, total, of, 2, 006, 000, military, dead, 700, 000, killed, in, action, 970, 000, died, of, wounds, 155, 000, died, of, disease, and, 181, 000, died, while, pows, this, measure, of, russian, losses, is, similar, to, that, of, the, british, empire, 5, of, the, male, population, in, the, 15, to, 49, age, group, he, says, civilian, casualties, were, five, to, six, hundred, thousand, in, the, first, two, years, and, were, then, not, kept, so, a, total, of, over, 1, 500, 000, is, not, unlikely, he, has, over, five, million, men, passing, into, captivity, the, majority, during, 1915, however, these, figures, are, very, contradictory, since, the, extreme, reports, on, prisoners, issued, by, the, official, commission, of, the, ussr, called, the, figure, at, 3, 3, million, later, these, data, were, criticized, by, golovin, who, conducted, a, study, together, with, german, veterans, in, the, archives, of, the, central, powers, and, named, a, figure, of, 2, 410, 000, people, when, russia, withdrew, from, the, war, 2, 500, 000, russian, pows, were, in, german, and, austrian, hands, this, by, far, exceeded, the, total, number, of, prisoners, of, war, 1, 880, 000, lost, by, the, armies, of, britain, france, and, germany, combined, only, the, austro, hungarian, army, with, 2, 200, 000, pows, came, even, close, according, to, other, data, the, number, of, irretrievable, losses, in, russia, ranges, from, 700, 000, to, 1, 061, 000, golovin, wrote, a, huge, work, dedicated, to, the, losses, of, russians, in, this, war, he, based, on, the, documents, of, the, headquarters, and, the, documents, of, the, german, archive, working, there, together, with, german, veterans, correlated, the, losses, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, total, losses, are, 7, 917, 000, including, 1, 300, 000, dead, 4, 200, 000, wounded, and, 2, 410, 000, prisoners, later, estimates, have, adjusted, this, number, to, 2, 420, 000, people, per, alexei, oleynikov, total, losses, for, the, 1914, 1917, campaigns, look, like, this, the, death, toll, of, a, maximum, of, 1, 000, 000, people, is, also, shared, by, other, authors, there, is, also, an, estimate, by, krivosheev, according, to, him, the, russians, lost, 2, 254, 000, dead, but, this, estimate, does, not, at, all, match, the, number, of, wounded, 2, 844, 500, according, to, the, russian, historian, kernosovsky, russia, s, losses, amounted, to, 9, 000, 000, at, that, time, the, losses, of, the, austro, german, troops, were, as, great, as, general, g, nther, blumentritt, wrote, in, his, memoirs, i, will, cite, a, little, known, but, significant, fact, our, losses, on, the, eastern, front, were, much, higher, than, on, the, western, historian, oleynikov, estimated, the, total, losses, at, 5, 100, 000, people, the, maximum, estimate, was, up, to, 6, 000, 000, casualties, this, ratio, is, much, better, than, on, the, western, front, similarly, the, losses, of, the, central, powers, in, the, east, in, the, period, from, 1914, 1916, were, greater, than, similar, losses, on, all, other, fronts, the, russian, army, was, able, to, inflict, damage, to, the, enemy, of, 4, 600, 000, people, from, a, total, loss, of, 8, 090, 000, the, russians, also, took, the, most, prisoners, as, many, as, 2, 130, 000, and, according, to, other, data, 1, 961, 000, there, is, also, an, estimate, of, 2, 200, 000, prisoners, but, the, general, trend, remains, to, estimate, about, 2, 000, 000, people, which, is, six, times, more, than, all, those, prisoners, who, were, captured, by, all, the, entente, countries, combined, the, empire, of, austria, lost, approximately, 60, of, its, territory, as, a, result, of, the, war, and, evolved, into, a, smaller, state, with, a, small, homogeneous, population, of, 6, 5, million, people, with, the, loss, vienna, was, now, an, imperial, capital, without, an, empire, to, support, it, the, states, that, were, formed, around, austria, feared, the, return, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, and, put, measures, into, place, to, prevent, it, from, re, forming, czechoslovakia, was, created, through, the, merging, of, the, czech, provinces, of, bohemia, and, moravia, previously, under, austrian, rule, united, with, slovakia, and, ruthenia, which, were, part, of, hungary, although, these, groups, had, many, differences, between, them, they, believed, that, together, they, would, create, a, stronger, state, the, new, country, was, a, multi, ethnic, state, the, population, consisted, of, czechs, 51, slovaks, 16, germans, 22, hungarians, 5, and, rusyns, 4, with, other, ethnic, groups, making, up, 2, many, of, the, germans, hungarians, ruthenians, and, poles, and, some, slovaks, felt, oppressed, because, the, political, elite, did, not, generally, allow, political, autonomy, for, minority, ethnic, groups, the, state, proclaimed, the, official, ideology, that, there, are, no, czechs, and, slovaks, but, only, one, nation, of, czechoslovaks, see, czechoslovakism, to, the, disagreement, of, slovaks, and, other, ethnic, groups, once, a, unified, czechoslovakia, was, restored, after, world, war, ii, the, conflict, between, the, czechs, and, the, slovaks, surfaced, again, after, the, war, hungary, was, severely, disrupted, by, the, loss, of, 72, of, its, territory, 64, of, its, population, and, most, of, its, natural, resources, the, loss, of, territory, was, similar, to, that, of, austria, after, the, breaking, up, the, austria, hungary, territory, they, lost, the, territories, of, transylvania, slovakia, croatia, slavonia, syrmia, and, banat, italy, incorporated, the, regions, of, trieste, and, south, tyrol, from, austria, the, creation, of, a, free, and, independent, poland, was, one, of, wilson, s, fourteen, points, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, state, of, poland, was, broken, apart, by, prussia, russia, and, austria, during, the, paris, peace, conference, 1919, the, commission, on, polish, affairs, was, created, which, recommended, there, be, a, passageway, across, west, prussia, and, posen, in, order, to, give, poland, access, to, the, baltic, through, the, port, of, danzig, at, the, mouth, of, the, vistula, river, the, creation, of, the, state, of, poland, would, separate, east, prussia, from, the, rest, of, germany, as, it, was, before, the, partitions, of, poland, poland, also, received, upper, silesia, british, foreign, secretary, lord, curzon, proposed, poland, s, eastern, border, with, russia, neither, the, soviet, russians, nor, the, polish, were, happy, with, the, demarcation, of, the, border, the, state, of, romania, was, enlarged, greatly, after, the, war, as, a, result, of, the, paris, peace, conference, romania, kept, the, dobrudja, and, transylvania, between, the, states, of, yugoslavia, czechoslovakia, and, romania, an, alliance, named, the, little, entente, was, formed, they, worked, together, on, matters, of, foreign, policy, in, order, to, prevent, a, habsburg, restoration, initially, yugoslavia, began, as, the, kingdom, of, serbs, croats, and, slovenes, the, name, was, changed, to, yugoslavia, in, 1929, the, state, secured, its, territory, at, the, paris, peace, conference, after, the, end, of, the, war, the, state, suffered, from, many, internal, problems, because, of, the, many, diverse, cultures, and, languages, within, the, state, yugoslavia, was, divided, on, national, linguistic, economic, and, religious, lines, most, modern, people, mistakenly, believe, that, the, russian, army, could, have, lost, the, war, after, 1916, this, is, not, the, case, general, brusilov, wrote, in, his, memoirs, people, mistakenly, believe, that, after, the, retreat, of, 1915, the, russian, army, could, not, fight, by, the, end, of, 1916, it, was, well, trained, and, accomplished, an, incredible, feat, she, defeated, the, superior, forces, of, the, enemy, and, in, such, numbers, that, no, other, army, in, the, world, could, have, won, russia, s, withdrawal, from, the, war, turned, out, to, be, a, nightmare, for, the, allies, even, the, entry, of, the, united, states, into, the, war, did, not, immediately, help, to, recover, from, such, strength, and, assistance, that, the, russian, army, brought, churchill, also, confirms, the, strength, of, the, russian, army, that, s, what, he, writes, history, was, not, so, merciless, to, any, country, as, to, russia, her, ship, was, pulled, when, the, harbor, was, already, visible, the, ship, was, wrecked, when, the, storm, passed, all, the, victims, had, already, been, transferred, the, work, was, already, over, despair, and, change, overcame, the, authorities, when, the, task, was, already, completed, these, words, are, also, supported, by, monogrophist, sergei, oldenburg, who, wrote, one, of, the, largest, works, about, the, time, of, tsar, nicholas, ii, oldenburg, believes, that, the, russian, troops, were, in, excellent, condition, by, the, beginning, of, 1917, he, claims, the, army, was, well, supplied, and, well, fed, and, there, were, 50, more, russians, than, austro, germans, in, terms, of, the, number, of, armed, men, at, the, front, and, the, russians, had, 10, more, artillery, in, terms, of, the, number, of, guns, the, supply, of, new, guns, was, also, huge, almost, as, much, as, the, total, of, britain, and, france, combined, in, the, army, of, the, central, powers, due, to, the, war, there, were, declines, in, industrial, opportunities, except, for, austria, but, the, growth, rate, of, russian, industry, was, still, higher, even, the, armies, of, the, central, powers, assessed, the, condition, of, the, russians, and, their, combat, strength, more, than, 72, of, all, infantry, divisions, were, characterized, by, the, information, committee, of, the, austrian, general, staff, as, outstanding, units, and, first, class, troops, however, all, these, material, successes, came, to, naught, after, the, february, revolution, which, killed, the, moral, composition, of, the, army, causing, an, incredible, wave, of, deserters
