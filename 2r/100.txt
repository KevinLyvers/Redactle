along, the, nile, valley, in, what, is, now, northern, sudan, and, southern, egypt, the, region, of, nubia, was, an, early, cradle, of, civilization, producing, several, complex, societies, that, engaged, in, trade, and, industry, the, city, state, of, kerma, emerged, as, the, dominant, political, force, between, 2450, and, 1450, bc, controlling, the, nile, valley, between, the, first, and, fourth, cataracts, an, area, as, large, as, egypt, the, egyptians, were, the, first, to, identify, kerma, as, kush, probably, from, the, indigenous, ethnonym, kasu, over, the, next, several, centuries, the, two, civilizations, engaged, in, intermittent, warfare, trade, and, cultural, exchange, much, of, nubia, came, under, egyptian, rule, during, the, new, kingdom, period, 1550, 1070, bc, following, egypt, s, disintegration, amid, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, the, kushites, reestablished, a, kingdom, in, napata, now, modern, karima, sudan, though, kush, had, developed, many, cultural, affinities, with, egypt, such, as, the, veneration, of, amun, and, the, royal, families, of, both, kingdoms, occasionally, intermarried, kushite, culture, language, and, ethnicity, was, distinct, egyptian, art, distinguished, the, people, of, kush, by, their, dress, appearance, and, even, method, of, transportation, in, the, 8th, century, bc, king, kashta, the, kushite, peacefully, became, king, of, upper, egypt, while, his, daughter, amenirdis, was, appointed, as, divine, adoratrice, of, amun, in, thebes, his, successor, piye, invaded, lower, egypt, establishing, the, kushite, ruled, twenty, fifth, dynasty, piye, s, daughter, shepenupet, ii, was, also, appointed, divine, adoratrice, of, amun, the, monarchs, of, kush, ruled, egypt, for, over, a, century, until, the, assyrian, conquest, finally, being, expelled, by, the, assyrian, kings, esarhaddon, and, ashurbanipal, in, the, mid, seventh, century, bc, following, the, severing, of, ties, with, egypt, the, kushite, imperial, capital, was, located, at, mero, during, which, time, it, was, known, by, the, greeks, as, aethiopia, from, the, third, century, bc, to, the, third, century, ad, northern, nubia, would, be, invaded, and, annexed, by, egypt, ruled, by, the, macedonians, and, romans, for, the, next, 600, years, this, territory, would, be, known, in, the, greco, roman, world, as, dodekaschoinos, it, was, later, taken, back, under, control, by, the, fourth, kushite, king, yesebokheamani, the, kingdom, of, kush, persisted, as, a, major, regional, power, until, the, fourth, century, ad, when, it, weakened, and, disintegrated, from, internal, rebellion, amid, worsening, climatic, conditions, and, invasions, and, conquest, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, by, the, noba, people, who, introduced, the, nubian, languages, and, gave, their, name, to, nubia, itself, because, the, noba, and, the, blemmyes, were, at, war, with, the, kushites, the, aksumites, took, advantage, of, this, capturing, mero, and, looting, its, gold, marking, the, end, of, the, kingdom, and, its, dissolution, into, the, three, polities, of, nobatia, makuria, and, alodia, though, the, aksumite, presence, in, meroe, was, likely, short, lived, sometime, after, this, event, the, kingdom, of, alodia, would, gain, control, of, the, southern, territory, of, the, former, meroitic, empire, including, parts, of, eritrea, long, overshadowed, by, its, more, prominent, egyptian, neighbor, archaeological, discoveries, since, the, late, 20th, century, have, revealed, kush, to, be, an, advanced, civilization, in, its, own, right, the, kushites, had, their, own, unique, language, and, script, maintained, a, complex, economy, based, on, trade, and, industry, mastered, archery, and, developed, a, complex, urban, society, with, uniquely, high, levels, of, female, participation, the, native, name, of, the, kingdom, was, recorded, in, egyptian, as, k, likely, pronounced, ipa, or, ipa, in, middle, egyptian, when, the,

centered, in, kerma, sudan, it, flourished, from, around, 2500, bc, to, 1500, bc, in, ancient, nubia, the, kerma, culture, was, based, in, the, southern, part, of, nubia, or, upper, nubia, in, parts, of, present, day, northern, and, central, sudan, and, later, extended, its, reach, northward, into, lower, nubia, and, the, border, of, egypt, the, polity, seems, to, have, been, one, of, several, nile, valley, states, during, the, middle, kingdom, of, egypt, in, the, kingdom, of, kerma, s, latest, phase, lasting, from, about, 1700, 1500, bc, it, absorbed, the, sudanese, kingdom, of, sa, and, became, a, sizable, populous, empire, rivaling, egypt, mentuhotep, ii, the, 21st, century, bc, founder, of, the, middle, kingdom, is, recorded, to, have, undertaken, campaigns, against, kush, in, the, 29th, and, 31st, years, of, his, reign, this, is, the, earliest, egyptian, reference, to, kush, the, nubian, region, had, gone, by, other, names, in, the, old, kingdom, under, thutmose, i, egypt,

eventually, resulted, in, their, annexation, of, nubia, c, 1504, bc, around, 1500, bc, nubia, was, absorbed, into, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, but, rebellions, continued, for, centuries, after, the, conquest, kerma, culture, was, increasingly, egyptianized, yet, rebellions, continued, for, 220, years, until, c, 1300, bc, nubia, nevertheless, became, a, key, province, of, the, new, kingdom,

assyrian, empire, 1365, 1020, bc, and, then, the, resurgent, neo, assyrian, empire, 935, 605, bc, the, assyrians, from, the, tenth, century, bc, onwards, had, once, more, expanded, from, northern, mesopotamia, and, conquered, a, vast, empire, including, the, whole, of, the, near, east, and, much, of, anatolia, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, caucasus, and, early, iron, age, iran, according, to, josephus, flavius, the, biblical, moses, led, the, egyptian, army, in, a, siege, of, the, kushite, city, of, meroe, to, end, the, siege, princess, tharbis, was, given, to, moses, as, a, diplomatic, bride, and, thus, the, egyptian, army, retreated, back, to, egypt, with, the, disintegration, of, the, new, kingdom, around, 1070, bc, kush, became, an, independent, kingdom, centered, at, napata, in, modern, northern, sudan, this, more, egyptianized, kingdom, of, kush, emerged, possibly, from, kerma, and, regained, the, region, s, independence, from, egypt, the, extent, of, cultural, political, continuity, between, the, kerma, culture, and, the, chronologically, succeeding, kingdom, of, kush, is, difficult, to, determine, the, latter, polity, began, to, emerge, around, 1000, bc, 500, years, after, the, end, of, the, kingdom, of, kerma, the, first, kushite, king, known, by, name, was, alara, who, ruled, somewhere, between, 800, and, 760, bc, no, contemporary, inscriptions, of, him, exist, he, was, first, mentioned, in, the, funerary, stela, of, his, daughter, tabiry, the, wife, of, king, piye, later, royal, inscriptions, remember, alara, as, the, founder, of, the, dynasty, some, calling, him, chieftain, others, king, a, 7th, century, inscription, claimed, that, his, sister, was, the, grandmother, of, king, taharqo, an, inscription, of, the, 5th, century, king, amanineteyerike, remembered, alara, s, reign, as, long, and, successful, alara, was, probably, buried, at, el, kurru, although, there, exists, no, inscription, to, identify, his, tomb, it, has, been, proposed, that, it, was, alara, who, turned, kush, from, a, chiefdom, to, an, egyptianized, kingdom, centered, around, the, cult, of, amun, alara, s, successor, kashta, extended, kushite, control, north, to, elephantine, and, thebes, in, upper, egypt, kashta, s, successor, piye, seized, control, of, lower, egypt, around, 727, bc, piye, s, victory, stela, celebrating, these, campaigns, between, 728, and, 716, bc, was, found, in, the, amun, temple, at, jebel, barkal, he, invaded, an, egypt, fragmented, into, four, kingdoms, ruled, by, king, peftjauawybast, king, nimlot, king, iuput, ii, and, king, osorkon, iv, 115, 120, why, the, kushites, chose, to, enter, egypt, at, this, crucial, point, of, foreign, domination, is, subject, to, debate, archaeologist, timothy, kendall, offers, his, own, hypotheses, connecting, it, to, a, claim, of, legitimacy, associated, with, jebel, barkal, kendall, cites, the, victory, stele, of, piye, at, jebel, barkal, which, states, that, amun, of, napata, granted, me, to, be, ruler, of, every, foreign, country, and, amun, in, thebes, granted, me, to, be, ruler, of, the, black, land, kmt, according, to, kendall, foreign, lands, in, this, regard, seems, to, include, lower, egypt, while, kmt, seems, to, refer, to, a, united, upper, egypt, and, nubia, piye, s, successor, shabataka, defeated, the, saite, kings, of, northern, egypt, between, 711, and, 710, bc, and, installed, himself, as, king, in, memphis, he, then, established, ties, with, sargon, ii, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 120, after, the, reign, of, shabaka, pharaoh, taharqa, s, army, undertook, successful, military, campaigns, as, attested, by, the, list, of, conquered, asiatic, principalities, from, the, mut, temple, at, karnak, and, conquered, peoples, and, countries, libyans, shasu, nomads, phoenicians, khor, in, palestine, from, sanam, temple, inscriptions, however, the, regions, in, the, southern, levant, claimed, by, shabataka, were, seen, by, assyria, as, under, their, dominion, and, imperial, ambitions, of, both, the, mesopotamian, based, assyrian, empire, and, kushite, empire, made, war, with, the, 25th, dynasty, inevitable, in, 701, bc, taharqa, and, his, army, aided, judah, and, king, hezekiah, in, withstanding, a, siege, by, king, sennacherib, of, the, assyrians, 2, kings, 19, 9, isaiah, 37, 9, there, are, various, theories, taharqa, s, army, disease, divine, intervention, hezekiah, s, surrender, or, agreeing, to, pay, tribute, as, to, why, the, assyrians, failed, to, take, the, city, historian, l, szl, t, r, k, mentions, that, egypt, s, army, was, beaten, at, eltekeh, under, taharqa, s, command, but, the, battle, could, be, interpreted, as, a, victory, for, the, double, kingdom, since, assyria, did, not, take, jerusalem, however, the, egyptian, and, kushite, forces, withdrew, to, egypt, and, the, assyrian, king, sennacherib, appears, to, have, occupied, part, of, the, sinai, the, power, of, the, 25th, dynasty, reached, a, climax, under, taharqa, the, nile, valley, empire, was, as, large, as, it, had, been, since, the, new, kingdom, new, prosperity, revived, egyptian, culture, religion, the, arts, and, architecture, were, restored, to, their, glorious, old, middle, and, new, kingdom, forms, the, kushite, pharaohs, built, or, restored, temples, and, monuments, throughout, the, nile, valley, including, memphis, karnak, kawa, and, jebel, barkal, it, was, during, the, 25th, dynasty, that, the, nile, valley, saw, the, first, widespread, construction, of, pyramids, many, in, modern, sudan, since, the, middle, kingdom, the, kushites, developed, their, own, script, the, meroitic, alphabet, which, was, influenced, by, egyptian, writing, systems, c, 700, 600, bc, although, it, appears, to, have, been, wholly, confined, to, the, royal, court, and, major, temples, taharqa, and, his, judean, allies, initially, defeated, the, assyrians, at, ashkelon, when, war, broke, out, in, 674, bc, the, relatively, small, assyrian, force, had, first, defeafed, canaanite, and, arab, tribes, in, the, region, and, then, immediately, marched, at, great, speed, on, ashkelon, leaving, them, exhausted, however, in, 671, bc, the, assyrian, king, esarhaddon, started, the, assyrian, conquest, of, egypt, with, a, larger, and, better, prepared, force, the, assyrians, advanced, rapidly, and, decisively, memphis, was, taken, and, taharqa, fled, to, nubia, while, his, heir, and, other, family, members, were, taken, to, the, assyrian, capital, nineveh, as, prisoners, esarhaddon, boasted, how, he, deported, all, aethiopians, from, egypt, leaving, not, one, to, pay, homage, to, me, however, the, native, egyptian, vassal, rulers, installed, by, esarhaddon, as, puppets, were, unable, to, effectively, retain, full, control, of, the, entire, country, and, taharqa, was, able, to, regain, control, of, memphis, esarhaddon, s, 669, bc, campaign, to, once, more, eject, taharqa, was, abandoned, when, esarhaddon, died, in, harran, on, the, way, to, egypt, leaving, esarhaddon, s, successor, ashurbanipal, the, task, he, defeated, taharqa, driving, his, forces, back, into, nubia, and, taharqa, died, in, napata, soon, after, in, 664, bc, 121, taharqa, s, successor, tantamani, sailed, north, from, napata, through, elephantine, and, to, thebes, with, a, large, army, where, he, was, ritually, installed, as, the, king, of, egypt, from, thebes, tantamani, began, his, attempt, at, reconquest, and, regained, control, of, a, part, of, southern, egypt, as, far, as, memphis, from, the, native, egyptian, puppet, rulers, installed, by, the, assyrians, tantamani, s, dream, stele, states, that, he, restored, order, from, the, chaos, where, royal, temples, and, cults, were, not, being, maintained, after, defeating, sais, and, killing, assyria, s, vassal, necho, i, in, memphis, some, local, dynasts, formally, surrendered, while, others, withdrew, to, their, fortresses, 185, tantamani, proceeded, north, of, memphis, invading, lower, egypt, and, besieged, cities, in, the, delta, a, number, of, which, surrendered, to, him, the, assyrians, who, had, maintained, only, a, small, military, presence, in, the, north, then, sent, a, large, army, southwards, in, 663, bc, tantamani, was, decisively, routed, and, the, assyrian, army, sacked, thebes, to, such, an, extent, it, never, truly, recovered, tantamani, was, chased, back, to, nubia, but, he, continued, to, try, and, assert, control, over, upper, egypt, until, c, 656, bc, at, this, date, a, native, egyptian, ruler, psamtik, i, son, of, necho, placed, on, the, throne, as, a, vassal, of, ashurbanipal, took, control, of, thebes, the, last, links, between, kush, and, upper, egypt, were, severed, after, hostilities, with, the, saite, kings, in, the, 590s, bc, 121, 122, kushite, civilization, continued, for, several, centuries, according, to, welsby, throughout, the, saite, persian, ptolemaic, and, roman, periods, the, kushite, rulers, the, descendants, of, the, xxvth, dynasty, pharaohs, and, the, guardians, of, the, temple, of, amun, at, jebel, barkal, could, have, pressed, their, legitimate, claim, for, control, of, egypt, and, they, thus, posed, a, potential, threat, to, the, rulers, of, egypt, 66, 67, herodotus, mentioned, an, invasion, of, kush, by, the, achaemenid, ruler, cambyses, c, 530, bc, by, some, accounts, cambyses, succeeded, in, occupying, the, area, between, the, first, and, second, nile, cataract, however, herodotus, mentions, that, his, expedition, failed, miserably, in, the, desert, 65, 66, achaemenid, inscriptions, from, both, egypt, and, iran, include, kush, as, part, of, the, achaemenid, empire, for, example, the, dna, inscription, of, darius, i, r, 522, 486, bc, on, his, tomb, at, naqsh, e, rustam, mentions, k, y, old, persian, cuneiform, pronounced, k, sh, y, among, the, territories, being, ruled, over, by, the, achaemenid, empire, derek, welsby, states, scholars, have, doubted, that, this, persian, expedition, ever, took, place, but, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, the, fortress, of, dorginarti, near, the, second, cataract, served, as, persia, s, southern, boundary, 65, 66, from, around, 425, 300, bc, beginning, under, the, rule, of, king, amannote, erike, kush, saw, a, series, of, kings, who, revitalized, older, practices, such, as, the, erection, of, royal, steles, or, royal, statues, it, was, likely, also, in, this, period, when, several, older, pyramids, among, them, that, of, taharqo, were, enlarged, the, stele, of, king, harsiotef, who, from, around, 400, bc, ruled, for, at, least, 35, years, reports, how, he, fought, a, multitude, of, campaigns, against, enemies, ranging, from, meroe, in, the, south, to, lower, nubia, in, the, north, while, also, donating, to, temples, throughout, kush, king, nastasen, c, 325, waged, several, wars, against, nomad, groups, and, again, in, lower, nubia, nastasen, was, the, last, king, to, be, buried, at, nuri, his, successors, built, six, pyramids, at, jebel, barkal, and, two, in, the, old, necropolis, of, el, kurru, although, the, lack, of, inscriptions, prevents, identifying, their, occupants, it, seems, likely, that, this, was, a, time, of, unrest, and, conflict, within, the, royal, elite, aspelta, moved, the, capital, to, mero, considerably, farther, south, than, napata, possibly, c, 591, bc, just, after, the, sack, of, napata, by, psamtik, ii, martin, meredith, states, the, kushite, rulers, chose, mero, between, the, fifth, and, sixth, cataracts, because, it, was, on, the, fringe, of, the, summer, rainfall, belt, and, the, area, was, rich, in, iron, ore, and, hardwood, for, iron, working, the, location, also, afforded, access, to, trade, routes, to, the, red, sea, the, kush, traded, iron, products, with, the, romans, in, addition, to, gold, ivory, and, slaves, the, butana, plain, was, stripped, of, its, forests, leaving, behind, slag, piles, in, about, 300, bc, the, move, to, mero, was, made, more, complete, when, the, monarchs, began, to, be, buried, there, instead, of, at, napata, one, theory, is, that, this, represents, the, monarchs, breaking, away, from, the, power, of, the, priests, at, napata, according, to, diodorus, siculus, kushite, king, ergamenes, defied, the, priests, and, had, them, slaughtered, this, story, may, refer, to, the, first, ruler, to, be, buried, at, mero, with, a, similar, name, such, as, arqamani, who, ruled, many, years, after, the, royal, cemetery, was, opened, at, mero, during, this, same, period, the, kushite, authority, may, have, extended, some, 1, 500, km, along, the, nile, river, valley, from, the, egyptian, frontier, in, the, north, to, areas, far, south, of, modern, khartoum, and, probably, also, substantial, territories, to, the, east, and, west, there, is, some, record, of, conflict, between, the, kushites, and, ptolemies, in, 275, or, 274, bc, ptolemy, ii, r, 283, 246, bc, sent, an, army, to, nubia, and, defeated, the, kingdom, of, kush, annexing, to, egypt, the, area, later, known, as, triakontaschoinos, in, addition, there, was, a, serious, revolt, at, the, end, of, ptolemy, iv, around, 204, bc, and, the, kushites, likely, tried, to, interfere, in, ptolemaic, affairs, 67, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, led, to, ptolemy, v, defacing, the, name, of, arqamani, on, inscriptions, at, philae, 67, arqamani, constructed, a, small, entrance, hall, to, the, temple, built, by, ptolemy, iv, at, selchis, and, constructed, a, temple, at, philae, to, which, ptolemy, contributed, an, entrance, hall, 66, there, is, evidence, of, ptolemaic, occupation, as, far, south, as, the, second, cataract, but, recent, finds, at, qasr, ibrim, such, as, the, total, absence, of, ptolemaic, pottery, have, cast, doubts, on, the, effectiveness, of, the, occupation, dynastic, struggles, led, to, the, ptolemies, abandoning, the, area, so, the, kushites, reasserted, their, control, with, qasr, ibrim, occupied, by, the, kushites, and, other, locations, perhaps, garrisoned, 67, according, to, welsby, after, the, romans, assumed, control, of, egypt, they, negotiated, with, the, kushites, at, philae, and, drew, the, southern, border, of, roman, egypt, at, aswan, 67, theodor, mommsen, and, welsby, state, the, kingdom, of, kush, became, a, client, kingdom, which, was, similar, to, the, situation, under, ptolemaic, rule, of, egypt, kushite, ambition, and, excessive, roman, taxation, are, two, theories, for, a, revolt, that, was, supported, by, kushite, armies, 67, 68, the, ancient, historians, strabo, and, pliny, give, accounts, of, the, conflict, with, roman, egypt, strabo, describes, a, war, with, the, romans, in, the, first, century, bc, according, to, strabo, the, kushites, sacked, aswan, with, an, army, of, 30, 000, men, and, destroyed, imperial, statues, at, philae, a, fine, over, life, size, bronze, head, of, the, emperor, augustus, was, found, buried, in, meroe, in, front, of, a, temple, 68, after, the, initial, victories, of, kandake, or, candace, amanirenas, against, roman, egypt, the, kushites, were, defeated, and, napata, sacked, remarkably, the, destruction, of, the, capital, of, napata, was, not, a, crippling, blow, to, the, kushites, and, did, not, frighten, candace, enough, to, prevent, her, from, again, engaging, in, combat, with, the, roman, military, in, 22, bc, a, large, kushite, force, moved, northward, with, intention, of, attacking, qasr, ibrim, 149, alerted, to, the, advance, gaius, petronius, prefect, of, roman, egypt, again, marched, south, and, managed, to, reach, qasr, ibrim, and, bolster, its, defenses, before, the, invading, kushites, arrived, welsby, states, after, a, kushite, attack, on, primis, qasr, ibrim, 69, 70, the, kushites, sent, ambassadors, to, negotiate, a, peace, settlement, with, petronius, the, kushites, succeeded, in, negotiating, a, peace, treaty, on, favorable, terms, trade, between, the, two, nations, increased, 149, and, the, roman, egyptian, border, being, extended, to, hiera, sykaminos, maharraqa, 70, this, arrangement, guaranteed, peace, for, most, of, the, next, 300, years, and, there, is, no, definite, evidence, of, further, clashes, 70, it, is, possible, that, the, roman, emperor, nero, planned, another, attempt, to, conquer, kush, before, his, death, in, ad, 68, 150, 151, nero, sent, two, centurions, upriver, as, far, as, bahr, el, ghazal, river, in, 66, ad, in, an, attempt, to, discover, the, source, of, the, nile, per, seneca, 43, or, plan, an, attack, per, pliny, kush, began, to, fade, as, a, power, by, the, first, or, second, century, ad, sapped, by, the, war, with, the, roman, province, of, egypt, and, the, decline, of, its, traditional, industries, however, there, is, evidence, of, third, century, ad, kushite, kings, at, philae, in, demotic, and, inscription, 71, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, kushites, reoccupied, lower, nubia, after, roman, forces, were, withdrawn, to, aswan, kushite, activities, led, others, to, note, a, de, facto, kushite, control, of, that, area, as, far, north, as, philae, for, part, of, the, third, century, ad, 71, thereafter, it, weakened, and, disintegrated, due, to, internal, rebellion, the, fall, of, meroe, is, often, associated, with, an, aksumite, invasion, an, aksumite, presence, in, meroe, is, confirmed, by, two, fragmentary, greek, inscriptions, the, better, preserved, one, referred, to, military, actions, and, the, imposition, of, a, tribute, they, probably, belonged, to, aksumite, victory, monuments, and, were, dedicated, to, ares, maher, the, god, of, war, thus, they, must, have, been, erected, before, aksum, s, conversion, to, christianity, in, around, 340, perhaps, by, king, ousanas, r, c, 310, 330, an, inscription, from, aksum, mentioning, kush, as, vassal, kingdom, may, also, be, attributed, to, ousanas, the, trilingual, stele, of, his, successor, ezana, describes, another, expedition, which, happened, after, 340, ezana, s, army, followed, the, course, of, the, atbara, until, reaching, the, nile, confluence, where, he, waged, war, against, kush, meroe, itself, is, not, mentioned, suggesting, that, ezana, did, not, attack, the, town, aksum, s, presence, in, nubia, was, likely, short, lived, meroitic, texts, from, as, early, as, the, 1st, century, bc, hint, to, conflicts, with, the, noba, who, lived, west, of, the, nile, and, were, governed, by, their, own, chiefs, and, kings, perhaps, it, was, the, increasingly, arid, climate, that, forced, them, to, attack, the, nile, valley, although, they, would, not, manage, to, break, through, until, the, 4th, century, the, ezana, stele, mentioned, that, they, had, occupied, kushite, towns, and, were, active, as, far, east, as, the, takeze, river, where, they, harassed, aksumite, vassals, these, attacks, and, them, breaking, oaths, they, had, sworn, to, ezana, were, the, main, reason, for, his, nubian, expedition, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, noba, were, not, necessarily, nubian, speakers, but, that, the, term, noba, was, rather, a, pejorative, meroitic, word, applied, to, a, large, variety, of, people, living, outside, the, meroitic, state, a, meroitic, stele, found, at, gebel, adda, from, around, 300, ad, however, seems, to, mention, a, king, bearing, the, nubian, name, trotihi, a, bowl, from, a, 4th, century, elite, burial, in, el, hobagi, features, a, meroitic, nubian, inscription, mentioning, a, king, but, identifying, the, interred, individual, and, the, polity, he, ruled, over, remains, problematic, at, meroe, the, last, pyramids, as, well, as, non, royal, burials, are, dated, to, the, mid, 4th, century, which, is, conventionally, thought, to, be, when, the, kingdom, of, kush, came, to, an, end, afterwards, began, the, so, called, post, meroitic, period, this, period, saw, a, decline, of, urbanism, the, disappearance, of, the, meroitic, religion, and, script, as, well, as, the, emergence, of, regional, elites, buried, in, large, tumuli, princely, burials, from, qustul, c, 380, 410, and, ballana, 410, 500, in, lower, nubia, are, connected, to, the, rise, of, nobatia, to, its, north, were, the, blemmyes, who, in, around, 394, established, a, kingdom, centered, around, talmis, that, lasted, until, it, was, conquered, by, nobatia, in, around, 450, the, political, developments, south, of, the, third, cataract, remain, obscure, but, it, appears, that, dongola, the, later, capital, of, makuria, as, well, as, soba, the, capital, of, alodia, were, founded, in, that, period, nobatia, makuria, and, alodia, eventually, converted, to, christianity, in, the, 6th, century, marking, the, beginning, of, medieval, nubia, the, meroitic, language, was, spoken, in, mero, and, sudan, during, the, meroitic, period, attested, from, 300, bc, it, became, extinct, around, 400, ad, it, is, uncertain, to, which, language, family, the, meroitic, language, belongs, kirsty, rowan, suggests, that, meroitic, like, the, egyptian, language, belongs, to, the, afro, asiatic, family, she, bases, this, on, its, sound, inventory, and, phonotactics, which, she, argues, are, similar, to, those, of, the, afro, asiatic, languages, and, dissimilar, from, those, of, the, nilo, saharan, languages, claude, rilly, proposes, that, meroitic, like, the, nobiin, language, belongs, to, the, eastern, sudanic, branch, of, the, nilo, saharan, family, based, in, part, on, its, syntax, morphology, and, known, vocabulary, in, the, napatan, period, egyptian, hieroglyphs, were, used, at, this, time, writing, seems, to, have, been, restricted, to, the, court, and, temples, from, the, second, century, bc, there, was, a, separate, meroitic, writing, system, the, language, was, written, in, two, forms, of, the, meroitic, alphabet, meroitic, cursive, which, was, written, with, a, stylus, and, was, used, for, general, record, keeping, and, meroitic, hieroglyphic, which, was, carved, in, stone, or, used, for, royal, or, religious, documents, it, is, not, well, understood, due, to, the, scarcity, of, bilingual, texts, the, earliest, inscription, in, meroitic, writing, dates, from, between, 180, and, 170, bc, these, hieroglyphics, were, found, engraved, on, the, temple, of, queen, shanakdakhete, meroitic, cursive, is, written, horizontally, and, reads, from, right, to, left, this, was, an, alphabetic, script, with, 23, signs, used, in, a, hieroglyphic, form, mainly, on, monumental, art, and, in, a, cursive, form, the, latter, was, widely, used, so, far, some, 1, 278, texts, using, this, version, are, known, leclant, 2000, the, script, was, deciphered, by, griffith, but, the, language, behind, it, is, still, a, problem, with, only, a, few, words, understood, by, modern, scholars, it, is, not, as, yet, possible, to, connect, the, meroitic, language, with, other, known, languages, for, a, time, it, was, also, possibly, used, to, write, the, old, nubian, language, of, the, successor, nubian, kingdoms, the, natives, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, developed, a, type, of, water, wheel, or, scoop, wheel, the, saqiyah, named, kol, by, the, kush, the, saqiyah, was, developed, during, the, meroitic, period, to, improve, irrigation, the, introduction, of, this, machine, had, a, decisive, influence, on, agriculture, especially, in, dongola, as, this, wheel, lifted, water, 3, to, 8, meters, with, much, less, expenditure, of, labor, and, time, than, the, shaduf, which, was, the, previous, chief, irrigation, device, in, the, kingdom, the, shaduf, relied, on, human, energy, but, the, saqiyah, was, driven, by, buffalos, or, other, animals, the, people, of, kerma, ancestors, to, the, kushites, built, bronze, kilns, through, which, they, manufactured, objects, of, daily, use, such, as, razors, mirrors, and, tweezers, the, kushites, developed, a, form, of, reservoir, known, as, a, hafir, during, the, meroitic, period, eight, hundred, ancient, and, modern, hafirs, have, been, registered, in, the, meroitic, town, of, butana, the, functions, of, hafirs, were, to, catch, water, during, the, rainy, season, for, storage, to, ensure, water, is, available, for, several, months, during, the, dry, season, as, well, as, supply, drinking, water, irrigate, fields, and, water, cattle, the, great, hafir, or, great, reservoir, near, the, lion, temple, in, musawwarat, es, sufra, is, a, notable, hafir, built, by, the, kushites, it, was, built, to, retain, the, rainfall, of, the, short, wet, season, it, is, 250, m, in, diameter, and, 6, 3, m, deep, bloomeries, and, blast, furnaces, could, have, been, used, in, metalworking, at, mero, early, records, of, bloomery, furnaces, dated, at, least, to, seventh, and, sixth, century, bc, have, been, discovered, in, kush, the, ancient, bloomeries, that, produced, metal, tools, for, the, kushites, produced, a, surplus, for, sale, nubian, mummies, studied, in, the, 1990s, revealed, that, kush, was, a, pioneer, of, early, antibiotics, tetracycline, was, being, used, by, nubians, based, on, bone, remains, between, 350, ad, and, 550, ad, the, antibiotic, was, in, wide, commercial, use, only, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, theory, states, that, earthen, jars, containing, grain, used, for, making, beer, contained, the, bacterium, streptomyces, which, produced, tetracycline, although, nubians, were, not, aware, of, tetracycline, they, could, have, noticed, that, people, fared, better, by, drinking, beer, according, to, charlie, bamforth, a, professor, of, biochemistry, and, brewing, science, at, the, university, of, california, davis, they, must, have, consumed, it, because, it, was, rather, tastier, than, the, grain, from, which, it, was, derived, they, would, have, noticed, people, fared, better, by, consuming, this, product, than, they, were, just, consuming, the, grain, itself, based, on, engraved, plans, of, meroitic, king, amanikhabali, s, pyramids, nubians, had, a, sophisticated, understanding, of, mathematics, as, they, appreciated, the, harmonic, ratio, the, engraved, plans, is, indicative, of, much, to, be, revealed, about, nubian, mathematics, the, ancient, nubians, also, established, a, system, of, geometry, which, they, used, in, creating, early, versions, of, sun, clocks, during, the, meroitic, period, in, nubian, history, the, nubians, used, a, trigonometric, methodology, similar, to, the, egyptians, during, the, siege, of, hermopolis, in, the, eighth, century, bc, siege, towers, were, built, for, the, kushite, army, led, by, piye, in, order, to, enhance, the, efficiency, of, kushite, archers, and, slingers, after, leaving, thebes, piye, s, first, objective, was, besieging, ashmunein, following, his, army, s, lack, of, success, he, undertook, the, personal, supervision, of, operations, including, the, erection, of, a, siege, tower, from, which, kushite, archers, could, fire, down, into, the, city, early, shelters, protecting, sappers, armed, with, poles, trying, to, breach, mud, brick, ramparts, gave, way, to, battering, rams, bowmen, were, the, most, important, force, components, in, the, kushite, military, ancient, sources, indicate, that, kushite, archers, favored, one, piece, bows, that, were, between, six, and, seven, feet, long, with, a, draw, strength, so, powerful, that, many, of, the, archers, used, their, feet, to, bend, their, bows, however, composite, bows, were, also, used, in, their, arsenal, greek, historian, herodotus, indicated, that, primary, bow, construction, was, of, seasoned, palm, wood, with, arrows, made, of, cane, kushite, arrows, were, often, poisoned, tipped, elephants, were, occasionally, used, in, warfare, during, the, meroitic, period, as, seen, in, the, war, against, rome, around, 20, bc, during, the, bronze, age, nubian, ancestors, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, built, speoi, a, speos, is, a, temple, or, tomb, cut, into, a, rock, face, between, 3700, and, 3250, bc, this, greatly, influenced, the, architecture, of, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, tomb, monuments, were, one, of, the, more, recognizable, expressions, of, kushite, architecture, uniquely, kushite, tomb, monuments, were, found, from, the, beginning, of, the, empire, at, el, kurru, to, the, decline, of, the, kingdom, these, monuments, developed, organically, from, middle, nile, e, g, a, group, burial, types, tombs, became, progressively, larger, during, the, 25th, dynasty, culminating, in, taharqa, s, underground, rectangular, building, with, aisles, of, square, piers, the, whole, being, cut, from, the, living, rock, 103, kushites, also, created, pyramids, mud, brick, temples, deffufa, and, masonry, temples, kushites, borrowed, much, from, egypt, as, it, relates, to, temple, design, kushite, temples, were, quite, diverse, in, their, plans, except, for, the, amun, temples, which, all, have, the, same, basic, plan, the, jebel, barkal, and, meroe, amun, temples, are, exceptions, with, the, 150, m, long, jebel, barkal, being, by, far, the, largest, egyptian, temple, ever, built, in, nubia, 118, temples, for, major, egyptian, deities, were, built, on, a, system, of, internal, harmonic, proportions, based, on, one, or, more, rectangles, each, with, sides, in, the, ratio, of, 8, 5, 133, kush, also, invented, nubian, vaults, piye, is, thought, to, have, constructed, the, first, true, pyramid, at, el, kurru, pyramids, are, the, archetypal, tomb, monument, of, the, kushite, royal, family, and, found, at, el, kurru, nuri, jebel, barkal, and, meroe, 105, the, kushite, pyramids, are, smaller, with, steeper, sides, than, northern, egyptian, pyramids, the, kushites, are, thought, to, have, copied, the, pyramids, of, new, kingdom, elites, as, opposed, to, old, and, middle, kingdom, pharaohs, 105, 106, kushite, housing, consisted, mostly, of, circular, timber, huts, with, some, apartment, houses, with, several, two, room, apartments, the, apartment, houses, likely, accommodated, extended, families, the, kushites, built, a, stone, paved, road, at, jebel, barkal, are, thought, to, have, built, piers, harbors, on, the, nile, river, and, many, wells, some, scholars, believe, the, economy, in, the, kingdom, of, kush, was, a, redistributive, system, the, state, would, collect, taxes, in, the, form, of, surplus, produce, and, would, redistribute, it, to, the, people, others, believe, that, most, of, the, society, worked, on, the, land, and, required, nothing, from, the, state, and, did, not, contribute, to, the, state, northern, kush, seems, to, have, been, more, productive, and, wealthier, than, the, southern, area, on, account, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, s, proximity, to, ancient, egypt, the, first, cataract, at, elephantine, usually, being, considered, the, traditional, border, between, the, two, polities, and, because, the, 25th, dynasty, ruled, over, both, states, in, the, eighth, century, bc, from, the, rift, valley, to, the, taurus, mountains, historians, have, closely, associated, the, study, of, kush, with, egyptology, in, keeping, with, the, general, assumption, that, the, complex, sociopolitical, development, of, egypt, s, neighbors, can, be, understood, in, terms, of, egyptian, models, as, a, result, the, political, structure, and, organization, of, kush, as, an, independent, ancient, state, has, not, received, as, thorough, attention, from, scholars, and, there, remains, much, ambiguity, especially, surrounding, the, earliest, periods, of, the, state, edwards, has, suggested, that, the, study, of, the, region, could, benefit, from, increased, recognition, of, kush, as, a, state, in, its, own, right, with, distinct, cultural, conditions, rather, than, merely, as, a, secondary, state, on, the, periphery, of, egypt
