the, dacians, d, e, n, z, latin, daci, greek, were, the, ancient, indo, european, inhabitants, of, the, cultural, region, of, dacia, located, in, the, area, near, the, carpathian, mountains, and, west, of, the, black, sea, they, are, often, considered, a, subgroup, of, the, thracians, this, area, includes, mainly, the, present, day, countries, of, romania, and, moldova, as, well, as, parts, of, ukraine, eastern, serbia, northern, bulgaria, slovakia, hungary, and, southern, poland, the, dacians, and, the, related, getae, spoke, the, dacian, language, which, has, a, debated, relationship, with, the, neighbouring, thracian, language, and, may, be, a, subgroup, of, it, dacians, were, somewhat, culturally, influenced, by, the, neighbouring, scythians, and, by, the, celtic, invaders, of, the, 4th, century, bc, the, dacians, were, known, as, geta, plural, getae, in, ancient, greek, writings, and, as, dacus, plural, daci, or, getae, in, roman, documents, but, also, as, dagae, and, gaete, as, depicted, on, the, late, roman, map, tabula, peutingeriana, it, was, herodotus, who, first, used, the, ethnonym, getae, in, his, histories, in, greek, and, latin, in, the, writings, of, julius, caesar, strabo, and, pliny, the, elder, the, people, became, known, as, the, dacians, getae, and, dacians, were, interchangeable, terms, or, used, with, some, confusion, by, the, greeks, latin, poets, often, used, the, name, getae, vergil, called, them, getae, four, times, and, daci, once, lucian, getae, three, times, and, daci, twice, horace, named, them, getae, twice, and, daci, five, times, while, juvenal, one, time, getae, and, two, times, daci, in, ad, 113, hadrian, used, the, poetic, term, getae, for, the, dacians, modern, historians, prefer, to, use, the, name, geto, dacians, strabo, describes, the, getae, and, dacians, as, distinct, but, cognate, tribes, this, distinction, refers, to, the, regions, they, occupied, strabo, and, pliny, the, elder, also, state, that, getae, and, dacians, spoke, the, same, language, by, contrast, the, name, of, dacians, whatever, the, origin, of, the, name, was, used, by, the, more, western, tribes, who, adjoined, the, pannonians, and, therefore, first, became, known, to, the, romans, according, to, strabo, s, geographica, the, original, name, of, the, dacians, was, daoi, the, name, daoi, one, of, the, ancient, geto, dacian, tribes, was, certainly, adopted, by, foreign, observers, to, designate, all, the, inhabitants, of, the, countries, north, of, danube, that, had, not, yet, been, conquered, by, greece, or, rome, the, ethnographic, name, daci, is, found, under, various, forms, within, ancient, sources, greeks, used, the, forms, dakoi, strabo, dio, cassius, and, dioscorides, and, daoi, singular, daos, the, form, daoi, was, frequently, used, according, to, stephan, of, byzantium, latins, used, the, forms, davus, dacus, and, a, derived, form, dacisci, vopiscus, and, inscriptions, there, are, similarities, between, the, ethnonyms, of, the, dacians, and, those, of, dahae, greek, d, oi, d, ai, dai, dasai, latin, dahae, daci, an, indo, european, people, located, east, of, the, caspian, sea, until, the, 1st, millennium, bc, scholars, have, suggested, that, there, were, links, between, the, two, peoples, since, ancient, times, the, historian, david, gordon, white, has, moreover, stated, that, the, dacians, appear, to, be, related, to, the, dahae, likewise, white, and, other, scholars, also, believe, that, the, names, dacii, and, dahae, may, also, have, a, shared, etymology, see, the, section, following, for, further, details, by, the, end, of, the, first, century, ad, all, the, inhabitants, of, the, lands, which, now, form, romania, were, known, to, the, romans, as, daci, with, the, exception, of, some, celtic, and, germanic, tribes, who, infiltrated, from, the, west, and, sarmatian, and, related, people, from, the, east, the, name, daci, or, dacians, is, a, collective, ethnonym, dio, cassius, reported, that, the, dacians, themselves, used, that, name, and, the, romans, so, called, them, while, the, greeks, called, them, getae, opinions, on, the, origins, of, the, name, daci, are, divided, some, scholars, consider, it, to, originate, in, the, indo, european, dha, k, with, the, stem, dhe, to, put, to, place, while, others, think, that, the, name, daci, originates, in, daca, knife, dagger, or, in, a, word, similar, to, d, os, meaning, wolf, in, the, related, language, of, the, phrygians, one, hypothesis, is, that, the, name, getae, originates, in, indo, european, guet, to, utter, to, talk, another, hypothesis, is, that, getae, and, daci, are, the, iranian, names, of, two, iranian, speaking, scythian, groups, that, had, been, assimilated, into, the, larger, thracian, speaking, population, of, the, later, dacia, in, the, 1st, century, ad, strabo, suggested, that, its, stem, formed, a, name, previously, borne, by, slaves, greek, daos, latin, davus, k, is, a, known, suffix, in, indo, european, ethnic, names, in, the, 18th, century, grimm, proposed, the, gothic, dags, or, day, that, would, give, the, meaning, of, light, brilliant, yet, dags, belongs, to, the, sanskrit, word, root, dah, and, a, derivation, from, dah, to, daci, is, difficult, in, the, 19th, century, tomaschek, 1883, proposed, the, form, dak, meaning, those, who, understand, and, can, speak, by, considering, dak, as, a, derivation, of, the, root, da, k, being, a, suffix, cf, sanskrit, dasa, bactrian, daonha, tomaschek, also, proposed, the, form, davus, meaning, members, of, the, clan, countryman, cf, bactrian, daqyu, danhu, canton, since, the, 19th, century, many, scholars, have, proposed, an, etymological, link, between, the, endonym, of, the, dacians, and, wolves, however, according, to, romanian, historian, and, archaeologist, alexandru, vulpe, the, dacian, etymology, explained, by, daos, wolf, has, little, plausibility, as, the, transformation, of, daos, into, dakos, is, phonetically, improbable, and, the, draco, standard, was, not, unique, to, dacians, he, thus, dismisses, it, as, folk, etymology, another, etymology, linked, to, the, proto, indo, european, language, roots, dhe, meaning, to, set, place, and, dheua, dava, settlement, and, dhe, k, daci, is, supported, by, romanian, historian, ioan, i, russu, 1967, mircea, eliade, attempted, in, his, book, from, zalmoxis, to, genghis, khan, to, give, a, mythological, foundation, to, an, alleged, special, relation, between, dacians, and, the, wolves, evidence, of, proto, thracians, or, proto, dacians, in, the, prehistoric, period, depends, on, the, remains, of, material, culture, it, is, generally, proposed, that, a, proto, dacian, or, proto, thracian, people, developed, from, a, mixture, of, indigenous, peoples, and, indo, europeans, from, the, time, of, proto, indo, european, expansion, in, the, early, bronze, age, 3, 300, 3, 000, bc, when, the, latter, around, 1500, bc, conquered, the, indigenous, peoples, the, indigenous, people, were, danubian, farmers, and, the, invading, people, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, were, kurgan, warrior, herders, from, the, ukrainian, and, russian, steppes, indo, europeanization, was, complete, by, the, beginning, of, the, bronze, age, the, people, of, that, time, are, best, described, as, proto, thracians, which, later, developed, in, the, iron, age, into, danubian, carpathian, geto, dacians, as, well, as, thracians, of, the, eastern, balkan, peninsula, between, 15th, 12th, century, bc, the, dacian, getae, culture, was, influenced, by, the, bronze, age, tumulus, urnfield, warriors, who, were, on, their, way, through, the, balkans, to, anatolia, in, the, 8th, to, 7th, centuries, bc, the, migration, of, the, scythians, from, the, east, into, the, pontic, steppe, pushed, westwards, and, away, from, the, steppes, the, related, scythic, agathyrsi, people, who, had, previously, dwelt, on, the, pontic, steppe, around, the, lake, maeotis, following, this, the, agathyrsi, settled, in, the, territories, of, present, day, moldova, transylvania, and, possibly, oltenia, where, they, mingled, with, the, indigenous, population, of, thracian, origins, when, the, agathyrsi, were, later, completely, assimilated, by, the, geto, thracian, populations, their, fortified, settlements, became, the, centres, of, the, getic, groups, who, would, later, transform, into, the, dacian, culture, an, important, part, of, the, dacian, people, descended, from, the, agathyrsi, when, the, la, t, ne, celts, arrived, in, the, 4th, century, bc, the, dacians, were, under, the, influence, of, the, scythians, alexander, the, great, attacked, the, getae, in, 335, bc, on, the, lower, danube, but, by, 300, bc, they, had, formed, a, state, founded, on, a, military, democracy, and, began, a, period, of, conquest, more, celts, arrived, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, in, the, 1st, century, bc, the, people, of, boii, tried, to, conquer, some, of, the, dacian, territory, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, teiss, river, the, dacians, drove, the, boii, south, across, the, danube, and, out, of, their, territory, at, which, point, the, boii, abandoned, any, further, plans, for, invasion, some, hungarian, historians, consider, the, dacians, and, getae, the, same, as, the, scythian, tribes, of, the, dahae, massagetae, also, the, exonym, daxia, one, with, dacia, north, of, the, danube, dacians, occupied, a, larger, territory, than, ptolemaic, dacia, stretching, between, bohemia, in, the, west, and, the, dnieper, cataracts, in, the, east, and, up, to, the, pripyat, vistula, and, oder, rivers, in, the, north, and, northwest, in, 53, bc, julius, caesar, stated, that, the, dacian, territory, was, on, the, eastern, border, of, the, hercynian, forest, according, to, strabo, s, geographica, written, around, ad, 20, the, getes, geto, dacians, bordered, the, suevi, who, lived, in, the, hercynian, forest, which, is, somewhere, in, the, vicinity, of, the, river, duria, the, present, day, v, h, waag, dacians, lived, on, both, sides, of, the, danube, according, to, strabo, moesians, also, lived, on, both, sides, of, the, danube, according, to, agrippa, dacia, was, limited, by, the, baltic, ocean, in, the, north, and, by, the, vistula, in, the, west, the, names, of, the, people, and, settlements, confirm, dacia, s, borders, as, described, by, agrippa, dacian, people, also, lived, south, of, the, danube, pontic, steppe, caucasus, east, asia, eastern, europe, northern, europe,

iranian, others, european, the, dacians, and, getae, were, always, considered, as, thracians, by, the, ancients, dio, cassius, trogus, pompeius, appian, strabo, and, pliny, the, elder, and, were, both, said, to, speak, the, same, thracian, language, the, linguistic, affiliation, of, dacian, is, uncertain, since, the, ancient, indo, european, language, in, question, became, extinct, and, left, very, limited, traces, usually, in, the, form, of, place, names, plant, names, and, personal, names, thraco, dacian, or, thracian, and, daco, mysian, seems, to, belong, to, the, eastern, satem, group, of, indo, european, languages, there, are, two, contradictory, theories, some, scholars, such, as, tomaschek, 1883, russu, 1967, solta, 1980, crossland, 1982, vraciu, 1980, consider, dacian, to, be, a, thracian, language, or, a, dialect, thereof, this, view, is, supported, by, r, g, solta, who, says, that, thracian, and, dacian, are, very, closely, related, languages, other, scholars, such, as, georgiev, 1965, duridanov, 1976, consider, that, thracian, and, dacian, are, two, different, and, specific, indo, european, languages, which, cannot, be, reduced, to, a, common, language, linguists, such, as, polom, and, kati, i, expressed, reservations, about, both, theories, the, dacians, are, generally, considered, to, have, been, thracian, speakers, representing, a, cultural, continuity, from, earlier, iron, age, communities, loosely, termed, getic, since, in, one, interpretation, dacian, is, a, variety, of, thracian, for, the, reasons, of, convenience, the, generic, term, daco, thracian, is, used, with, dacian, reserved, for, the, language, or, dialect, that, was, spoken, north, of, danube, in, present, day, romania, and, eastern, hungary, and, thracian, for, the, variety, spoken, south, of, the, danube, there, is, no, doubt, that, the, thracian, language, was, related, to, the, dacian, language, which, was, spoken, in, what, is, today, romania, before, some, of, that, area, was, occupied, by, the, romans, also, both, thracian, and, dacian, have, one, of, the, main, satem, characteristic, changes, of, indo, european, language, k, and, g, to, s, and, z, with, regard, to, the, term, getic, getae, even, though, attempts, have, been, made, to, distinguish, between, dacian, and, getic, there, seems, no, compelling, reason, to, disregard, the, view, of, the, greek, geographer, strabo, that, the, daci, and, the, getae, thracian, tribes, dwelling, north, of, the, danube, the, daci, in, the, west, of, the, area, and, the, getae, further, east, were, one, and, the, same, people, and, spoke, the, same, language, another, variety, that, has, sometimes, been, recognized, is, that, of, moesian, or, mysian, for, the, language, of, an, intermediate, area, immediately, to, the, south, of, danube, in, serbia, bulgaria, and, romanian, dobruja, this, and, the, dialects, north, of, the, danube, have, been, grouped, together, as, daco, moesian, the, language, of, the, indigenous, population, has, left, hardly, any, trace, in, the, anthroponymy, of, moesia, but, the, toponymy, indicates, that, the, moesii, on, the, south, bank, of, the, danube, north, of, the, haemus, mountains, and, the, triballi, in, the, valley, of, the, morava, shared, a, number, of, characteristic, linguistic, features, with, the, dacii, south, of, the, carpathians, and, the, getae, in, the, wallachian, plain, which, sets, them, apart, from, the, thracians, though, their, languages, are, undoubtedly, related, dacian, culture, is, mostly, followed, through, roman, sources, ample, evidence, suggests, that, they, were, a, regional, power, in, and, around, the, city, of, sarmizegetusa, sarmizegetusa, was, their, political, and, spiritual, capital, the, ruined, city, lies, high, in, the, mountains, of, central, romania, vladimir, georgiev, disputes, that, dacian, and, thracian, were, closely, related, for, various, reasons, most, notably, that, dacian, and, moesian, town, names, commonly, end, with, the, suffix, dava, while, towns, in, thrace, proper, i, e, south, of, the, balkan, mountains, generally, end, in, para, see, dacian, language, according, to, georgiev, the, language, spoken, by, the, ethnic, dacians, should, be, classified, as, daco, moesian, and, regarded, as, distinct, from, thracian, georgiev, also, claimed, that, names, from, approximately, roman, dacia, and, moesia, show, different, and, generally, less, extensive, changes, in, indo, european, consonants, and, vowels, than, those, found, in, thrace, itself, however, the, evidence, seems, to, indicate, divergence, of, a, thraco, dacian, language, into, northern, and, southern, groups, of, dialects, not, so, different, as, to, qualify, as, separate, languages, polom, considers, that, such, lexical, differentiation, dava, vs, para, would, however, be, hardly, enough, evidence, to, separate, daco, moesian, from, thracian, an, extensive, account, of, the, native, tribes, in, dacia, can, be, found, in, the, ninth, tabula, of, europe, of, ptolemy, s, geography, the, geography, was, probably, written, in, the, period, ad, 140, 150, but, the, sources, were, often, earlier, for, example, roman, britain, is, shown, before, the, building, of, hadrian, s, wall, in, the, ad, 120s, ptolemy, s, geography, also, contains, a, physical, map, probably, designed, before, the, roman, conquest, and, containing, no, detailed, nomenclature, there, are, references, to, the, tabula, peutingeriana, but, it, appears, that, the, dacian, map, of, the, tabula, was, completed, after, the, final, triumph, of, roman, nationality, ptolemy, s, list, includes, no, fewer, than, twelve, tribes, with, geto, dacian, names, the, fifteen, tribes, of, dacia, as, named, by, ptolemy, starting, from, the, northernmost, ones, are, as, follows, first, the, anartes, the, teurisci, and, the, coertoboci, costoboci, to, the, south, of, them, are, the, buredeense, buri, burs, the, cotenses, cotini, and, then, the, albocenses, the, potulatenses, and, the, sense, while, the, southernmost, were, the, saldenses, the, ciaginsi, and, the, piephigi, to, the, south, of, them, were, predasenses, predavenses, the, rhadacenses, rhatacenses, the, caucoenses, cauci, and, biephi, twelve, out, of, these, fifteen, tribes, listed, by, ptolemy, are, ethnic, dacians, and, three, are, celts, anarti, teurisci, and, cotenses, there, are, also, previous, brief, mentions, of, other, getae, or, dacian, tribes, on, the, left, and, right, banks, of, the, danube, or, even, in, transylvania, to, be, added, to, the, list, of, ptolemy, among, these, other, tribes, are, the, trixae, crobidae, and, appuli, some, peoples, inhabiting, the, region, generally, described, in, roman, times, as, dacia, were, not, ethnic, dacians, the, true, dacians, were, a, people, of, thracian, descent, german, elements, daco, germans, celtic, elements, daco, celtic, and, iranian, elements, daco, sarmatian, occupied, territories, in, the, north, west, and, north, east, of, dacia, this, region, covered, roughly, the, same, area, as, modern, romania, plus, bessarabia, republic, of, moldova, and, eastern, galicia, south, west, ukraine, although, ptolemy, places, moldavia, and, bessarabia, in, sarmatia, europaea, rather, than, dacia, after, the, dacian, wars, ad, 101, 6, the, romans, occupied, only, about, half, of, the, wider, dacian, region, the, roman, province, of, dacia, covered, just, western, wallachia, as, far, as, the, limes, transalutanus, east, of, the, river, alutus, or, olt, and, transylvania, as, bordered, by, the, carpathians, the, impact, of, the, roman, conquest, on, these, people, is, uncertain, one, hypothesis, was, that, they, were, effectively, eliminated, an, important, clue, to, the, character, of, dacian, casualties, is, offered, by, the, ancient, sources, eutropius, and, crito, both, speak, about, men, when, they, describe, the, losses, suffered, by, the, dacians, in, the, wars, this, suggests, that, both, refer, to, losses, due, to, fighting, not, due, to, a, process, of, extermination, of, the, whole, population, a, strong, component, of, the, dacian, army, including, the, celtic, bastarnae, and, the, germans, had, withdrawn, rather, than, submit, to, trajan, some, scenes, on, trajan, s, column, represent, acts, of, obedience, of, the, dacian, population, and, others, show, the, refugee, dacians, returning, to, their, own, places, dacians, trying, to, buy, amnesty, are, depicted, on, trajan, s, column, one, offers, to, trajan, a, tray, of, three, gold, ingots, alternatively, a, substantial, number, may, have, survived, in, the, province, although, were, probably, outnumbered, by, the, romanised, immigrants, cultural, life, in, dacia, became, very, mixed, and, decidedly, cosmopolitan, because, of, the, colonial, communities, the, dacians, retained, their, names, and, their, own, ways, in, the, midst, of, the, newcomers, and, the, region, continued, to, exhibit, dacian, characteristics, the, dacians, who, survived, the, war, are, attested, as, revolting, against, the, roman, domination, in, dacia, at, least, twice, in, the, period, of, time, right, after, the, dacian, wars, and, in, a, more, determined, manner, in, 117, ad, in, 158, ad, they, revolted, again, and, were, put, down, by, m, statius, priscus, some, dacians, were, apparently, expelled, from, the, occupied, zone, at, the, end, of, each, of, the, two, dacian, wars, or, otherwise, emigrated, it, is, uncertain, where, these, refugees, settled, some, of, these, people, might, have, mingled, with, the, existing, ethnic, dacian, tribes, beyond, the, carpathians, the, costoboci, and, carpi, after, trajan, s, conquest, of, dacia, there, was, recurring, trouble, involving, dacian, groups, excluded, from, the, roman, province, as, finally, defined, by, hadrian, by, the, early, third, century, the, free, dacians, as, they, were, earlier, known, were, a, significantly, troublesome, group, then, identified, as, the, carpi, requiring, imperial, intervention, on, more, than, one, occasion, in, 214, caracalla, dealt, with, their, attacks, later, philip, the, arab, came, in, person, to, deal, with, them, he, assumed, the, triumphal, title, carpicus, maximus, and, inaugurated, a, new, era, for, the, province, of, dacia, july, 20, 246, later, both, decius, and, gallienus, assumed, the, titles, dacicus, maximus, in, 272, aurelian, assumed, the, same, title, as, philip, in, about, 140, ad, ptolemy, lists, the, names, of, several, tribes, residing, on, the, fringes, of, the, roman, dacia, west, east, and, north, of, the, carpathian, range, and, the, ethnic, picture, seems, to, be, a, mixed, one, north, of, the, carpathians, are, recorded, the, anarti, teurisci, and, costoboci, the, anarti, or, anartes, and, the, teurisci, were, originally, probably, celtic, peoples, or, mixed, dacian, celtic, the, anarti, together, with, the, celtic, cotini, are, described, by, tacitus, as, vassals, of, the, powerful, quadi, germanic, people, the, teurisci, were, probably, a, group, of, celtic, taurisci, from, the, eastern, alps, however, archaeology, has, revealed, that, the, celtic, tribes, had, originally, spread, from, west, to, east, as, far, as, transylvania, before, being, absorbed, by, the, dacians, in, the, 1st, century, bc, the, main, view, is, that, the, costoboci, were, ethnically, dacian, others, considered, them, a, slavic, or, sarmatian, tribe, there, was, also, a, celtic, influence, so, that, some, consider, them, a, mixed, celtic, and, thracian, group, that, appear, after, trajan, s, conquest, as, a, dacian, group, within, the, celtic, superstratum, the, costoboci, inhabited, the, southern, slopes, of, the, carpathians, ptolemy, named, the, coestoboci, costoboci, in, roman, sources, twice, showing, them, divided, by, the, dniester, and, the, peucinian, carpathian, mountains, this, suggests, that, they, lived, on, both, sides, of, the, carpathians, but, it, is, also, possible, that, two, accounts, about, the, same, people, were, combined, there, was, also, a, group, the, transmontani, that, some, modern, scholars, identify, as, dacian, transmontani, costoboci, of, the, extreme, north, the, name, transmontani, was, from, the, dacians, latin, literally, people, over, the, mountains, mullenhoff, identified, these, with, the, transiugitani, another, dacian, tribe, north, of, the, carpathian, mountains, based, on, the, account, of, dio, cassius, heather, 2010, considers, that, hasding, vandals, around, 171, ad, attempted, to, take, control, of, lands, which, previously, belonged, to, the, free, dacian, group, called, the, costoboci, hrushevskyi, 1997, mentions, that, the, earlier, widespread, view, that, these, carpathian, tribes, were, slavic, has, no, basis, this, would, be, contradicted, by, the, coestobocan, names, themselves, that, are, known, from, the, inscriptions, written, by, a, coestobocan, and, therefore, presumably, accurately, these, names, sound, quite, unlike, anything, slavic, scholars, such, as, tomaschek, 1883, sch, tte, 1917, and, russu, 1969,

historical, period, beginning, in, the, 5th, century, bc, when, thracians, were, under, greek, influence, it, may, not, have, originated, with, the, thracians, as, it, could, be, just, a, fashion, borrowed, from, greeks, for, specifying, ancestry, and, for, distinguishing, homonymous, individuals, within, the, tribe, sch, tte, 1917, parvan, and, florescu, 1982, pointed, also, to, the, dacian, characteristic, place, names, ending, in, dava, given, by, ptolemy, in, the, costoboci, s, country, the, carpi, were, a, sizeable, group, of, tribes, who, lived, beyond, the, north, eastern, boundary, of, roman, dacia, the, majority, view, among, modern, scholars, is, that, the, carpi, were, a, north, thracian, tribe, and, a, subgroup, of, the, dacians, however, some, historians, classify, them, as, slavs, according, to, heather, 2010, the, carpi, were, dacians, from, the, eastern, foothills, of, the, carpathian, range, modern, moldavia, and, wallachia, who, had, not, been, brought, under, direct, roman, rule, at, the, time, of, trajan, s, conquest, of, transylvania, dacia, after, they, generated, a, new, degree, of, political, unity, among, themselves, in, the, course, of, the, third, century, these, dacian, groups, came, to, be, known, collectively, as, the, carpi, the, ancient, sources, about, the, carpi, before, 104, ad, located, them, on, a, territory, situated, between, the, western, side, of, eastern, european, galicia, and, the, mouth, of, the, danube, the, name, of, the, tribe, is, homonymous, with, the, carpathian, mountains, carpi, and, carpathian, are, dacian,

greek, latin, carpo, dacae, who, attacked, the, romans, in, the, late, 4th, century, is, seen, as, evidence, of, their, dacian, ethnicity, in, fact, carpi, carpodaces, is, the, term, used, for, dacians, outside, of, dacia, proper, however, that, the, carpi, were, dacians, is, shown, not, so, much, by, the, form, in, zosimus, as, by, their, characteristic, place, names, in, dava, given, by, ptolemy, in, their, country, the, origin, and, ethnic, affiliations, of, the, carpi, have, been, debated, over, the, years, in, modern, times, they, are, closely, associated, with, the, carpathian, mountains, and, a, good, case, has, been, made, for, attributing, to, the, carpi, a, distinct, material, culture, a, developed, form, of, the, geto, dacian, la, tene, culture, often, known, as, the, poienesti, culture, which, is, characteristic, of, this, area, dacians, are, represented, in, the, statues, surmounting, the, arch, of, constantine, and, on, trajan, s, column, the, artist, of, the, column, took, some, care, to, depict, in, his, opinion, a, variety, of, dacian, people, from, high, ranking, men, women, and, children, to, the, near, savage, although, the, artist, looked, to, models, in, hellenistic, art, for, some, body, types, and, compositions, he, does, not, represent, the, dacians, as, generic, barbarians, classical, authors, applied, a, generalized, stereotype, when, describing, the, barbarians, celts, scythians, thracians, inhabiting, the, regions, to, the, north, of, the, greek, world, in, accordance, with, this, stereotype, all, these, peoples, are, described, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, civilized, greeks, as, being, much, taller, their, skin, lighter, and, with, straight, light, coloured, hair, and, blue, eyes, for, instance, aristotle, wrote, that, the, scythians, on, the, black, sea, and, the, thracians, are, straight, haired, for, both, they, themselves, and, the, environing, air, are, moist, according, to, clement, of, alexandria, xenophanes, described, the, thracians, as, ruddy, and, tawny, on, trajan, s, column, dacian, soldiers, hair, is, depicted, longer, than, the, hair, of, roman, soldiers, and, they, had, trimmed, beards, body, painting, was, customary, among, the, dacians, it, is, probable, that, the, tattooing, originally, had, a, religious, significance, they, practiced, symbolic, ritual, tattooing, or, body, painting, for, both, men, and, women, with, hereditary, symbols, transmitted, up, to, the, fourth, generation, in, the, absence, of, historical, records, written, by, the, dacians, and, thracians, themselves, analysis, of, their, origins, depends, largely, on, the, remains, of, material, culture, on, the, whole, the, bronze, age, witnessed, the, evolution, of, the, ethnic, groups, which, emerged, during, the, eneolithic, period, and, eventually, the, syncretism, of, both, autochthonous, and, indo, european, elements, from, the, steppes, and, the, pontic, regions, various, groups, of, thracians, had, not, separated, out, by, 1200, bc, but, there, are, strong, similarities, between, the, ceramic, types, found, at, troy, and, the, ceramic, types, from, the, carpathian, area, about, the, year, 1000, bc, the, carpatho, danubian, countries, were, inhabited, by, a, northern, branch, of, the, thracians, at, the, time, of, the, arrival, of, the, scythians, c, 700, bc, the, carpatho, danubian, thracians, were, developing, rapidly, towards, the, iron, age, civilization, of, the, west, moreover, the, whole, of, the, fourth, period, of, the, carpathian, bronze, age, had, already, been, profoundly, influenced, by, the, first, iron, age, as, it, developed, in, italy, and, the, alpine, lands, the, scythians, arriving, with, their, own, type, of, iron, age, civilization, put, a, stop, to, these, relations, with, the, west, from, roughly, 500, bc, the, second, iron, age, the, dacians, developed, a, distinct, civilization, which, was, capable, of, supporting, large, centralised, kingdoms, by, the, 1st, century, bc, and, the, 1st, century, ad, since, the, very, first, detailed, account, by, herodotus, getae, are, acknowledged, as, belonging, to, the, thracians, still, they, are, distinguished, from, the, other, thracians, by, particularities, of, religion, and, custom, the, first, written, mention, of, the, name, dacians, is, in, roman, sources, but, classical, authors, are, unanimous, in, considering, them, a, branch, of, the, getae, a, thracian, people, known, from, greek, writings, strabo, specified, that, the, daci, are, the, getae, who, lived, in, the, area, towards, the, pannonian, plain, transylvania, while, the, getae, proper, gravitated, towards, the, black, sea, coast, scythia, minor, since, the, writings, of, herodotus, in, the, 5th, century, bc, getae, dacians, are, acknowledged, as, belonging, to, the, thracian, sphere, of, influence, despite, this, they, are, distinguished, from, other, thracians, by, particularities, of, religion, and, custom, geto, dacians, and, thracians, were, kin, people, but, they, were, not, the, same, the, differences, from, the, southern, thracians, or, from, the, neighbouring, scythians, were, probably, faint, as, several, ancient, authors, make, confusions, of, identification, with, both, groups, linguist, vladimir, georgiev, says, that, based, on, the, absence, of, toponyms, ending, in, dava, in, southern, bulgaria, the, moesians, and, dacians, or, as, he, calls, them, daco, mysians, couldn, t, be, related, to, the, thracians, in, the, 19th, century, tomaschek, considered, a, close, affinity, between, the, besso, thracians, and, getae, dacians, an, original, kinship, of, both, people, with, iranian, peoples, they, are, aryan, tribes, several, centuries, before, scolotes, of, the, pont, and, sauromatae, left, the, aryan, homeland, and, settled, in, the, carpathian, chain, in, the, haemus, balkan, and, rhodope, mountains, the, besso, thracians, and, getae, dacians, separated, very,

dacians, absorbed, the, celtic, influence, from, the, northwest, in, the, early, third, century, bc, archaeological, investigation, of, this, period, has, highlighted, several, celtic, warrior, graves, with, military, equipment, it, suggests, the, forceful, penetration, of, a, military, celtic, elite, within, the, region, of, dacia, now, known, as, transylvania, that, is, bounded, on, the, east, by, the, carpathian, range, the, archaeological, sites, of, the, third, and, second, centuries, bc, in, transylvania, revealed, a, pattern, of, co, existence, and, fusion, between, the, bearers, of, la, t, ne, culture, and, indigenous, dacians, these, were, domestic, dwellings, with, a, mixture, of, celtic, and, dacian, pottery, and, several, graves, in, the, celtic, style, containing, vessels, of, dacian, type, there, are, some, seventy, celtic, sites, in, transylvania, mostly, cemeteries, but, most, if, not, all, of, them, indicate, that, the, native, population, imitated, celtic, art, forms, that, took, their, fancy, but, remained, obstinately, and, fundamentally, dacian, in, their, culture, the, celtic, helmet, from, ciume, ti, satu, mare, romania, northern, dacia, an, iron, age, raven, totem, helmet, dated, around, the, 4th, century, bc, a, similar, helmet, is, depicted, on, the, thraco, celtic, gundestrup, cauldron, being, worn, by, one, of, the, mounted, warriors, detail, tagged, here, see, also, an, illustration, of, brennos, wearing, a, similar, helmet, around, 150, bc, la, t, ne, material, disappears, from, the, area, this, coincides, with, the, ancient, writings, which, mention, the, rise, of, dacian, authority, it, ended, the, celtic, domination, and, it, is, possible, that, celts, were, driven, out, of, dacia, alternatively, some, scholars, have, proposed, that, the, transylvanian, celts, remained, but, merged, into, the, local, culture, and, thus, ceased, to, be, distinctive, archaeological, discoveries, in, the, settlements, and, fortifications, of, the, dacians, in, the, period, of, their, kingdoms, 1st, century, bc, and, 1st, century, ad, included, imported, celtic, vessels, and, others, made, by, dacian, potters, imitating, celtic, prototypes, showing, that, relations, between, the, dacians, and, the, celts, from, the, regions, north, and, west, of, dacia, continued, in, present, day, slovakia, archaeology, has, revealed, evidence, for, mixed, celtic, dacian, populations, in, the, nitra, and, hron, river, basins, after, the, dacians, subdued, the, celtic, tribes, the, remaining, cotini, stayed, in, the, mountains, of, central, slovakia, where, they, took, up, mining, and, metalworking, together, with, the, original, domestic, population, they, created, the, puchov, culture, that, spread, into, central, and, northern, slovakia, including, spis, and, penetrated, northeastern, moravia, and, southern, poland, along, the, bodrog, river, in, zemplin, they, created, celtic, dacian, settlements, which, were, known, for, the, production, of, painted, ceramics, herodotus, says, before, darius, reached, the, danube, the, first, people, he, subdued, were, the, getae, who, believed, that, they, never, die, a, persian, clay, tablet, found, at, gherla, mentions, darius, and, although, the, persian, army, probably, did, not, reach, the, modern, findspot, of, the, tablet, the, object, is, probably, evidence, of, the, persian, campaign, to, dacia, it, is, possible, that, the, persian, expedition, and, the, subsequent, occupation, may, have, altered, the, way, in, which, the, getae, expressed, the, immortality, belief, the, influence, of, thirty, years, of, achaemenid, presence, may, be, detected, in, the, emergence, of, an, explicit, iconography, of, the, royal, hunt, that, influenced, dacian, and, thracian, metalworkers, and, of, the, practice, of, hawking, by, their, upper, class, greek, and, roman, chroniclers, record, the, defeat, and, capture, of, the, macedonian,

of, the, getae, the, scythians, arrival, in, the, carpathian, mountains, is, dated, to, 700, bc, the, agathyrsi, of, transylvania, had, been, mentioned, by, herodotus, fifth, century, bc, who, regarded, them, as, not, a, scythian, people, but, closely, related, to, them, in, other, respects, their, customs, were, close, to, those, of, the, thracians, the, agathyrsi, were, completely, denationalized, at, the, time, of, herodotus, and, absorbed, by, the, native, thracians, the, opinion, that, the, agathyrsi, were, almost, certainly, thracians, results, also, from, the, writings, preserved, by, stephen, of, byzantium, who, explains, that, the, greeks, called, the, trausi, the, agathyrsi, and, we, know, that, the, trausi, lived, in, the, rhodope, mountains, certain, details, from, their, way, of, life, such, as, tattooing, also, suggest, that, the, agathyrsi, were, thracians, their, place, was, later, taken, by, the, dacians, that, the, dacians, were, of, thracian, stock, is, not, in, doubt, and, it, is, safe, to, assume, that, this, new, name, also, encompassed, the, agathyrsi, and, perhaps, other, neighbouring, thracian, people, as, well, as, a, result, of, some, political, upheaval, the, goths, a, confederation, of, east, german, peoples, arrived, in, southern, ukraine, no, later, than, 230, during, the, next, decade, a, large, section, of, them, moved, down,

magni, great, dacians, costoboci, generally, considered, a, dacian, subtribe, and, carpi, remained, outside, the, roman, empire, in, what, the, romans, called, dacia, libera, free, dacia, by, the, early, third, century, the, free, dacians, were, a, significantly, troublesome, group, by, now, identified, as, the, carpi, bichir, argues, that, the, carpi, were, the, most, powerful, of, the, dacian, tribes, who, had, become, the, principal, enemy, of, the, romans, in, the, region, in, 214, ad, caracalla, campaigned, against, the, free, dacians, there, were, also, campaigns, against, the,

the, empire, there, caused, by, the, carpi, visigoths, sarmatians, and, vandals, the, lines, of, defence, needed, to, be, shortened, and, dacia, was, deemed, not, defensible, given, the, demands, on, available, resources, roman, power, in, thracia, rested, mainly, with, the, legions, stationed, in, moesia, the, rural, nature, of, thracia, s, populations, and, the, distance, from, roman, authority, encouraged, the, presence, of, local, troops, to, support, moesia, s, legions, over, the, next, few, centuries, the, province, was, periodically, and, increasingly, attacked, by, migrating, germanic, tribes, the, reign, of, justinian, saw, the, construction, of, over, 100, legionary, fortresses, to, supplement, the, defence, thracians, in, moesia, and, dacia, were, romanized, while, those, within, the, byzantine, empire, were, their, hellenized, descendants, that, had, mingled, with, the, greeks, roman, dacia, was, never, a, uniformly, or, fully, romanized, area, post, aurelianic, dacia, fell, into, three, divisions, the, area, along, the, river, usually, under, some, type, of, roman, administration, even, if, in, a, highly, localized, form, the, zone, beyond, this, area, from, which, roman, military, personnel, had, withdrawn, leaving, a, sizable, population, behind, that, was, generally, romanized, and, finally, what, is, now, the, northern, parts, of, moldavia, crisana, and, maramures, which, were, never, occupied, by, the, romans, these, last, areas, were, always, peripheral, to, the, roman, province, not, militarily, occupied, but, nonetheless, influenced, by, rome, as, part, of, the, roman, economic, sphere, here, lived, the, free, unoccupied, carpi, often, called, free, dacians, the, aurelian, retreat, was, a, purely, military, decision, to, withdraw, the, roman, troops, to, defend, the, danube, the, inhabitants, of, the, old, province, of, dacia, displayed, no, awareness, of, impending, dissolution, there, were, no, sudden, flights, or, dismantling, of, property, it, is, not, possible, to, discern, how, many, civilians, followed, the, army, out, of, dacia, it, is, clear, that, there, was, no, mass, emigration, since, there, is, evidence, of, continuity, of, settlement, in, dacian, villages, and, farms, the, evacuation, may, not, at, first, have, been, intended, to, be, a, permanent, measure, the, romans, left, the, province, but, they, didn, t, consider, that, they, lost, it, dobrogea, was, not, abandoned, at, all, but, continued, as, part, of, the, roman, empire, for, over, 350, years, as, late, as, ad, 300, the, tetrarchic, emperors, had, resettled, tens, of, thousands, of, dacian, carpi, inside, the, empire, dispersing, them, in, communities, the, length, of, the, danube, from, austria, to, the, black, sea, dacians, were, divided, into, two, classes, the, aristocracy, tarabostes, and, the, common, people, comati, only, the, aristocracy, had, the, right, to, cover, their, heads, and, wore, a, felt, hat, the, common, people, who, comprised, the, rank, and, file, of, the, army, the, peasants, and, artisans, might, have, been, called, capillati, in, latin, their, appearance, and, clothing, can, be, seen, on, trajan, s, column, the, chief, occupations, of, the, dacians, were, agriculture, apiculture, viticulture, livestock, ceramics, and, metalworking, they, also, worked, the, gold, and, silver, mines, of, transylvania, at, pecica, arad, a, dacian, workshop, was, discovered, along, with, equipment, for, minting, coins, and, evidence, of, bronze, silver, and, iron, working, that, suggests, a, broad, spectrum, of, smithing, evidence, for, the, mass, production, of, iron, is, found, on, many, dacian, sites, indicating, guild, like, specialization, dacian, ceramic, manufacturing, traditions, continue, from, the, pre, roman, to, the, roman, period, both, in, provincial, and, unoccupied, dacia, and, well, into, the, fourth, and, even, early, fifth, centuries, they, engaged, in, considerable, external, trade, as, is, shown, by, the, number, of, foreign, coins, found, in, the, country, see, also, decebalus, treasure, on, the, northernmost, frontier, of, free, dacia, coin, circulation, steadily, grew, in, the, first, and, second, centuries, with, a, decline, in, the, third, and, a, rise, again, in, the, fourth, century, the, same, pattern, as, observed, for, the, banat, region, to, the, southwest, what, is, remarkable, is, the, extent, and, increase, in, coin, circulation, after, roman, withdrawal, from, dacia, and, as, far, north, as, transcarpathia, the, first, coins, produced, by, the, geto, dacians, were, imitations, of, silver, coins, of, the, macedonian, kings, philip, ii, and, alexander, the, great, early, in, the, 1st, century, bc, the, dacians, replaced, these, with, silver, denarii, of, the, roman, republic, both, official, coins, of, rome, exported, to, dacia, as, well, as, locally, made, imitations, of, them, the, roman, province, dacia, is, represented, on, the, roman, sestertius, coin, as, a, woman, seated, on, a, rock, holding, an, aquila, a, small, child, on, her, knee, the, aquila, holds, ears, of, grain, and, another, small, child, is, seated, before, her, holding, grapes, dacians, had, developed, the, murus, dacicus, double, skinned, ashlar, masonry, with, rubble, fill, and, tie, beams, characteristic, to, their, complexes, of, fortified, cities, like, their, capital, sarmizegetusa, regia, in, what, is, today, hunedoara, county, romania, this, type, of, wall, has, been, discovered, not, only, in, the, dacian, citadel, of, the, orastie, mountains, but, also, in, those, at, covasna, breaza, near, f, g, ra, tili, ca, near, sibiu, c, p, lna, in, the, sebe, valley, b, ni, a, not, far, from, petro, ani, and, piatra, craivii, to, the, north, of, alba, iulia, the, degree, of, their, urban, development, was, displayed, on, trajan, s, column, and, in, the, account, of, how, sarmizegetusa, regia, was, defeated, by, the, romans, the, romans, were, given, by, treachery, the, locations, of, aqueducts, and, pipelines, of, the, dacian, capital, only, after, destroying, the, water, supply, being, able, to, end, the, long, siege, of, sarmisegetuza, according, to, romanian, nationalist, archaeology, the, cradle, of, the, dacian, culture, is, considered, to, be, north, of, the, danube, towards, the, carpathian, mountains, in, the, historical, romanian, province, of, muntenia, it, is, identified, as, an, evolution, of, the, iron, age, basarabi, culture, such, narrative, believe, that, the, earlier, iron, age, basarabi, evidence, in, the, northern, lower, danube, area, connects, to, the, iron, using, ferigile, birsesti, group, this, is, an, archaeological, manifestation, of, the, historical, getae, who, along, with, the, agathyrsae, are, one, of, a, number, of, tribal, formations, recorded, by, herodotus, in, archaeology, free, dacians, are, attested, by, the, puchov, culture, in, which, there, are, celtic, elements, and, lipi, a, culture, to, the, east, of, the, carpathians, the, lipi, a, culture, has, a, dacian, north, thracian, origin, this, north, thracian, population, was, dominated, by, strong, celtic, influences, or, had, simply, absorbed, celtic, ethnic, components, lipi, a, culture, has, been, linked, to, the, dacian, tribe, of, costoboci, these, standpoints, are, highly, problematic, as, there, is, no, linear, continuity, between, aforementioned, cultures, in, reality, the, creation, of, the, dacian, ethnos, was, foreshadowed, by, migratory, movements, from, the, lower, danube, region, following, the, collapse, of, the, celtic, cultural, circle, c, 300, bc, the, grave, with, a, helmet, from, ciume, ti, 50, years, from, its, discovery, comments, on, the, greaves, 2, the, padea, panagjurski, kolonii, group, in, transylvania, old, and, new, discoveries, specific, dacian, material, culture, includes, wheel, turned, pottery, that, is, generally, plain, but, with, distinctive, elite, wares, massive, silver, dress, fibulae, precious, metal, plate, ashlar, masonry, fortifications, upland, sanctuaries, with, horseshoe, shaped, precincts, and, decorated, clay, heart, altars, at, settlement, sites, among, many, discovered, artifacts, the, dacian, bracelets, stand, out, depicting, their, cultural, and, aesthetic, sense, there, are, difficulties, correlating, funerary, monuments, chronologically, with, dacian, settlements, a, small, number, of, burials, are, known, along, with, cremation, pits, and, isolated, rich, burials, as, at, cugir, dacian, burial, ritual, continued, under, roman, occupation, and, into, the, post, roman, period, the, dacians, are, generally, considered, to, have, been, thracian, speakers, representing, a, cultural, continuity, from, earlier, iron, age, communities, some, historians, and, linguists, consider, dacian, language, to, be, a, dialect, of, or, the, same, language, as, thracian, the, vocalism, and, consonantism, differentiate, the, dacian, and, thracian, languages, others, consider, that, dacian, and, illyrian, form, regional, varieties, dialects, of, a, common, language, thracians, inhabited, modern, southern, bulgaria, and, northern, greece, illyrians, lived, in, modern, albania, serbia, montenegro, bosnia, herzegovina, and, croatia, the, ancient, languages, of, these, people, became, extinct, and, their, cultural, influence, highly, reduced, after, the, repeated, invasions, of, the, balkans, by, celts, huns, goths, and, sarmatians, accompanied, by, persistent, hellenization, romanisation, and, later, slavicisation, therefore, in, the, study, of, the, toponomy, of, dacia, one, must, take, account, of, the, fact, that, some, place, names, were, taken, by, the, slavs, from, as, yet, unromanised, dacians, a, number, of, dacian, words, are, preserved, in, ancient, sources, amounting, to, about, 1150, anthroponyms, and, 900, toponyms, and, in, discorides, some, of, the, rich, plant, lore, of, the, dacians, is, preserved, along, with, the, names, of, 42, medicinal, plants, the, dacians, knew, about, writing, permanent, contacts, with, the, graeco, roman, world, had, brought, the, use, of, the, greek, and, later, the, latin, alphabet, it, is, also, certainly, not, the, case, that, writing, with, greek, and, latin, letters, and, knowledge, of, greek, and, latin, were, known, in, all, the, settlements, scattered, throughout, dacia, but, there, is, no, doubt, about, the, existence, of, such, knowledge, in, some, circles, of, dacian, society, however, the, most, revealing, discoveries, concerning, the, use, of, the, writing, by, the, dacians, occurred, in, the, citadels, on, the, sebes, mountains, some, groups, of, letters, from, stone, blocks, at, sarmisegetuza, might, express, personal, names, these, cannot, now, be, read, because, the, wall, is, ruined, and, because, it, is, impossible, to, restore, the, original, order, of, the, blocks, in, the, wall, dacian, religion, was, considered, by, the, classic, sources, as, a, key, source, of, authority, suggesting, to, some, that, dacia, was, a, predominantly, theocratic, state, led, by, priest, kings, however, the, layout, of, the, dacian, capital, sarmizegethusa, indicates, the, possibility, of, co, rulership, with, a, separate, high, king, and, high, priest, ancient, sources, recorded, the, names, of, several, dacian, high, priests, deceneus, comosicus, and, vezina, and, various, orders, of, priests, god, worshipers, smoke, walkers, and, founders, both, hellenistic, and, oriental, influences, are, discernible, in, the, religious, background, alongside, chthonic, and, solar, motifs, according, to, herodotus, account, of, the, story, of, zalmoxis, or, zamolxis, the, getae, speaking, the, same, language, as, the, dacians, and, the, thracians, according, to, strabo, believed, in, the, immortality, of, the, soul, and, regarded, death, as, merely, a, change, of, country, their, chief, priest, held, a, prominent, position, as, the, representative, of, the, supreme, deity, zalmoxis, who, is, called, also, gebeleizis, by, some, among, them, strabo, wrote, about, the, high, priest, of, king, burebista, deceneus, a, man, who, not, only, had, wandered, through, egypt, but, also, had, thoroughly, learned, certain, prognostics, through, which, he, would, pretend, to, tell, the, divine, will, and, within, a, short, time, he, was, set, up, as, god, as, i, said, when, relating, the, story, of, zamolxis, the, goth, jordanes, in, his, getica, the, origin, and, deeds, of, the, goths, also, gives, an, account, of, deceneus, the, highest, priest, and, considered, dacians, a, nation, related, to, the, goths, besides, zalmoxis, the, dacians, believed, in, other, deities, such, as, gebeleizis, the, god, of, storm, and, lightning, possibly, related, to, the, thracian, god, zibelthiurdos, he, was, represented, as, a, handsome, man, sometimes, with, a, beard, later, gebeleizis, was, equated, with, zalmoxis, as, the, same, god, according, to, herodotus, gebeleizis, zebeleizis, gebeleizis, who, is, only, mentioned, by, herodotus, is, just, another, name, of, zalmoxis, another, important, deity, was, bendis, goddess, of, the, moon, and, the, hunt, by, a, decree, of, the, oracle, of, dodona, which, required, the, athenians, to, grant, land, for, a, shrine, or, temple, her, cult, was, introduced, into, attica, by, immigrant, thracian, residents, and, though, thracian, and, athenian, processions, remained, separate, both, cult, and, festival, became, so, popular, that, in, plato, s, time, c, 429, 13, bc, its, festivities, were, naturalised, as, an, official, ceremony, of, the, athenian, city, state, called, the, bendideia, known, dacian, theonyms, include, zalmoxis, gebele, zis, and, darzalas, gebeleizis, is, probably, cognate, to, the, thracian, god, zibelthiurdos, also, zbelsurdos, zibelthurdos, wielder, of, lightning, and, thunderbolts, derzelas, also, darzalas, was, a, chthonic, god, of, health, and, human, vitality, the, pagan, religion, survived, longer, in, dacia, than, in, other, parts, of, the, empire, christianity, made, little, headway, until, the, fifth, century, fragments, of, pottery, with, different, inscriptions, with, latin, and, greek, letters, incised, before, and, after, firing, have, been, discovered, in, the, settlement, at, ocnita, valcea, an, inscription, carries, the, word, basileus, in, greek, meaning, king, and, seems, to, have, been, written, before, the, vessel, was, hardened, by, fire, other, inscriptions, contain, the, name, of, the, king, believed, to, be, thiemarcus, and, latin, groups, of, letters, bvr, reb, bvr, indicates, the, name, of, the, tribe, or, union, of, tribes, the, buridavensi, dacians, who, lived, at, buridava, and, who, were, mentioned, by, ptolemy, in, the, second, century, ad, under, the, name, of, buridavensioi, the, typical, dress, of, dacians, both, men, and, women, can, be, seen, on, trajan, s, column, dio, chrysostom, described, the, dacians, as, natural, philosophers, the, history, of, dacian, warfare, spans, from, c, 10th, century, bc, up, to, the, 2nd, century, ad, in, the, region, typically, referred, to, by, ancient, greek, and, latin, historians, as, dacia, it, concerns, the, armed, conflicts, of, the, dacian, tribes, and, their, kingdoms, in, the, balkans, apart, from, conflicts, between, dacians, and, neighboring, nations, and, tribes, numerous, wars, were, recorded, among, dacian, tribes, as, well, the, weapon, most, associated, with, the, dacian, forces, that, fought, against, trajan, s, army, during, his, invasions, of, dacia, was, the, falx, a, single, edged, scythe, like, weapon, the, falx, was, able, to, inflict, horrible, wounds, on, opponents, easily, disabling, or, killing, the, heavily, armored, roman, legionaries, that, they, faced, this, weapon, more, so, than, any, other, single, factor, forced, the, roman, army, to, adopt, previously, unused, or, modified, equipment, to, suit, the, conditions, on, the, dacian, battlefield, this, is, a, list, of, several, important, dacian, individuals, or, those, of, partly, dacian, origin, study, of, the, dacians, their, culture, society, and, religion, is, not, purely, a, subject, of, ancient, history, but, has, present, day, implications, in, the, context, of, romanian, nationalism, positions, taken, on, the, vexed, question, of, the, origin, of, the, romanians, and, to, what, degree, are, present, day, romanians, descended, from, the, dacians, might, have, contemporary, political, implications, for, example, the, government, of, nicolae, ceau, escu, claimed, an, uninterrupted, continuity, of, a, dacian, romanian, state, from, king, burebista, to, ceau, escu, himself, the, ceau, escu, government, conspicuously, commemorated, the, supposed, 2, 050th, anniversary, of, the, founding, of, the, unified, and, centralized, country, that, was, to, become, romania, on, which, occasion, the, historical, film, burebista, was, produced, the, ducks, come, from, the, trucks, a, romanian, language, pun, about, a, mistranslation, duck, and, truck, sound, like, dac, and, trac, the, ethnonyms, for, dacian, and, thracian
