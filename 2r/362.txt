during, the, age, of, discovery, a, large, scale, colonization, of, the, americas, involving, a, number, of, european, countries, took, place, primarily, between, the, late, 15th, century, and, the, early, 19th, century, the, norse, explored, and, colonized, areas, of, europe, and, the, north, atlantic, colonizing, greenland, and, creating, a, short, term, settlement, near, the, northern, tip, of, newfoundland, circa, 1000, ad, however, due, to, its, long, duration, and, importance, the, later, colonization, by, the, european, powers, involving, the, continents, of, north, america, and, south, america, is, more, well, known, during, this, time, the, european, empires, of, spain, portugal, britain, france, russia, the, netherlands, denmark, and, sweden, began, to, explore, and, claim, the, americas, its, natural, resources, and, human, capital, leading, to, the, displacement, disestablishment, enslavement, and, even, genocide, of, the, indigenous, peoples, in, the, americas, and, the, establishment, of, several, settler, colonial, states, some, settler, colonies, remain, relatively, rural, and, sparsely, populated, with, indigenous, people, as, of, the, 21st, century, including, new, mexico, alaska, the, northern, great, plains, the, north, western, territory, and, greenland, in, north, america, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, the, yucat, n, peninsula, and, the, dari, n, gap, in, central, america, and, the, northwest, amazon, the, central, andes, the, guianas, the, gran, chaco, and, araucan, a, in, south, america, russia, began, colonizing, the, pacific, northwest, in, the, mid, 18th, century, seeking, pelts, for, the, fur, trade, many, of, the, social, structures, including, religions, political, boundaries, and, linguae, francae, which, predominate, in, the, western, hemisphere, in, the, 21st, century, are, the, descendants, of, those, that, were, established, during, this, period, the, rapid, rate, at, which, some, european, nations, grew, in, wealth, and, power, was, unforeseeable, in, the, early, 15th, century, because, it, had, been, preoccupied, with, internal, wars, and, it, was, slowly, recovering, from, the, loss, of, population, caused, by, the, black, death, the, ottoman, empire, s, domination, of, trade, routes, to, asia, prompted, western, european, monarchs, to, search, for, alternatives, resulting, in, the, voyages, of, christopher, columbus, and, his, accidental, arrival, at, the, new, world, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, in, 1494, portugal, and, spain, agreed, to, divide, the, earth, in, two, with, portugal, having, dominion, over, non, christian, lands, in, the, world, s, eastern, half, and, spain, over, those, in, the, western, half, spanish, claims, essentially, included, all, of, the, americas, however, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, granted, the, eastern, tip, of, south, america, to, portugal, where, it, established, brazil, in, the, early, 1500s, and, the, east, indies, to, spain, where, it, established, the, philippines, the, city, of, santo, domingo, in, the, current, day, dominican, republic, founded, in, 1496, by, columbus, is, credited, as, the, oldest, continuously, inhabited, european, established, settlement, in, the, americas, by, the, 1530s, other, western, european, powers, realized, they, too, could, benefit, from, voyages, to, the, americas, leading, to, british, and, french, colonializations, in, the, northeast, tip, of, the, americas, including, in, the, present, day, united, states, within, a, century, the, swedish, established, new, sweden, the, dutch, established, new, netherland, and, denmark, norway, along, with, the, swedish, and, dutch, established, colonization, of, parts, of, the, caribbean, by, the, 1700s, denmark, norway, revived, its, former, colonies, in, greenland, and, russia, began, to, explore, and, claim, the, pacific, coast, from, alaska, to, california, violent, conflicts, arose, during, the, beginning, of, this, period, as, indigenous, peoples, fought, to, preserve, their, territorial, integrity, from, increasing, european, colonizers, and, from, hostile, indigenous, neighbors, who, were, equipped, with, eurasian, technology, conflict, between, the, various, european, empires, and, the, indigenous, peoples, was, a, leading, dynamic, in, the, americas, into, the, 1800s, although, some, parts, of, the, continent, gained, their, independence, from, europe, by, then, countries, such, as, the, united, states, continued, to, fight, against, native, americans, and, practiced, settler, colonialism, the, united, states, for, example, practiced, a, settler, colonial, policy, of, manifest, destiny, and, the, trail, of, tears, other, regions, including, california, patagonia, the, north, western, territory, and, the, northern, great, plains, experienced, little, to, no, colonization, at, all, until, the, 1800s, european, contact, and, colonization, had, disastrous, effects, on, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, and, their, societies, norse, viking, explorers, are, the, first, known, europeans, to, set, foot, on, north, america, norse, journeys, to, greenland, and, canada, are, supported, by, historical, and, archaeological, evidence, the, norsemen, established, a, colony, in, greenland, in, the, late, tenth, century, and, lasted, until, the, mid, 15th, century, with, court, and, parliament, assemblies, ing, taking, place, at, brattahl, and, a, bishop, located, at, gar, ar, the, remains, of, a, settlement, at, l, anse, aux, meadows, in, newfoundland, canada, were, discovered, in, 1960, and, were, dated, to, around, the, year, 1000, carbon, dating, estimate, 990, 1050, l, anse, aux, meadows, is, the, only, site, widely, accepted, as, evidence, of, pre, columbian, trans, oceanic, contact, it, was, named, a, world, heritage, site, by, unesco, in, 1978, it, is, also, notable, for, its, possible, connection, with, the, attempted, colony, of, vinland, established, by, leif, erikson, around, the, same, period, or, more, broadly, with, the, norse, colonization, of, the, americas, leif, erikson, s, brother, is, said, to, have, had, the, first, contact, with, the, native, population, of, north, america, which, would, come, to, be, known, as, the, skr, lings, after, capturing, and, killing, eight, of, the, natives, they, were, attacked, at, their, beached, ships, which, they, defended, systematic, european, colonization, began, in, 1492, a, spanish, expedition, sailed, west, in, order, to, find, a, new, trade, route, to, the, far, east, the, source, of, spices, silks, porcelains, and, other, rich, trade, goods, ottoman, control, of, the, silk, road, the, traditional, route, for, trade, between, europe, and, asia, forced, european, traders, to, look, for, alternative, routes, the, genoese, mariner, christopher, columbus, led, an, expedition, to, find, a, route, to, east, asia, but, instead, landed, in, the, bahamas, columbus, encountered, the, lucayan, people, on, the, island, guanahani, possibly, cat, island, which, they, had, inhabited, since, the, ninth, century, in, his, reports, columbus, exaggerated, the, quantity, of, gold, in, the, east, indies, which, he, called, the, new, world, these, claims, along, with, the, slaves, he, brought, back, convinced, the, monarchy, to, fund, a, second, voyage, word, of, columbus, s, exploits, spread, quickly, sparking, the, western, european, exploration, conquest, and, colonization, of, the, americas, spanish, explorers, conquerors, and, settlers, sought, material, wealth, prestige, and, the, spread, of, christianity, often, summed, up, in, the, phrase, gold, glory, and, god, the, spanish, justified, their, claims, to, the, new, world, based, on, the, ideals, of, the, christian, reconquista, of, the, iberian, peninsula, from, the, muslims, completed, in, 1492, in, the, new, world, military, conquest, to, incorporate, indigenous, peoples, into, christendom, was, considered, the, spiritual, conquest, in, 1493, pope, alexander, vi, the, first, spaniard, to, become, pope, issued, a, series, of, papal, bulls, that, confirmed, spanish, claims, to, the, newly, discovered, lands, after, the, final, reconquista, of, iberia, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, was, ratified, by, the, pope, the, two, kingdoms, of, castile, in, a, personal, union, with, other, kingdoms, of, spain, and, portugal, in, 1494, the, treaty, divided, the, entire, non, european, world, into, two, spheres, of, exploration, and, colonization, the, longitudinal, boundary, cut, through, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, eastern, part, of, present, day, brazil, the, countries, declared, their, rights, to, the, land, despite, the, fact, that, indigenous, populations, had, settled, from, pole, to, pole, in, the, hemisphere, and, it, was, their, homeland, after, european, contact, the, native, population, of, the, americas, plummeted, by, an, estimated, 80, from, around, 50, million, in, 1492, to, eight, million, in, 1650, due, in, part, to, old, world, diseases, carried, to, the, new, world, smallpox, was, especially, devastating, for, it, could, be, passed, through, touch, allowing, native, tribes, to, be, wiped, out, and, the, conditions, that, colonization, imposed, on, indigenous, populations, such, as, forced, labor, and, removal, from, homelands, and, traditional, medicines, some, scholars, have, argued, that, this, demographic, collapse, was, the, result, of, the, first, large, scale, act, of, genocide, in, the, modern, era, for, example, the, labor, and, tribute, of, inhabitants, of, hispaniola, were, granted, in, encomienda, to, spaniards, a, practice, established, in, spain, for, conquered, muslims, although, not, technically, slavery, it, was, coerced, labor, for, the, benefit, of, the, spanish, grantees, called, encomenderos, spain, had, a, legal, tradition, and, devised, a, proclamation, known, as, the, requerimento, to, be, read, to, indigenous, populations, in, spanish, often, far, from, the, field, of, battle, stating, that, the, indigenous, were, now, subjects, of, the, spanish, crown, and, would, be, punished, if, they, resisted, when, the, news, of, this, situation, and, of, the, abuse, of, the, institution, reached, spain, the, new, laws, were, passed, to, regulate, and, gradually, abolish, the, system, in, the, americas, as, well, as, to, reiterate, the, prohibition, of, enslaving, native, americans, by, the, time, the, new, laws, were, passed, 1542, the, spanish, crown, had, acknowledged, their, inability, to, control, and, properly, ensure, compliance, of, traditional, laws, overseas, so, they, granted, to, native, americans, specific, protections, not, even, spaniards, had, such, as, the, prohibition, of, enslaving, them, even, in, the, case, of, crime, or, war, these, extra, protections, were, an, attempt, to, avoid, the, proliferation, of, irregular, claims, to, slavery, however, as, historian, andr, s, res, ndez, has, noted, this, categorical, prohibition, did, not, stop, generations, of, determined, conquistadors, and, colonists, from, taking, native, slaves, on, a, planetary, scale, the, fact, that, this, other, slavery, had, to, be, carried, out, clandestinely, made, it, even, more, insidious, it, is, a, tale, of, good, intentions, gone, badly, astray, a, major, event, in, early, spanish, colonization, which, had, so, far, yielded, paltry, returns, was, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, 1519, 1521, it, was, led, by, hern, n, cort, s, and, made, possible, by, securing, indigenous, alliances, with, the, aztecs, enemies, mobilizing, thousands, of, warriors, against, the, aztecs, for, their, own, political, reasons, the, aztec, capital, tenochtitlan, became, mexico, city, the, chief, city, of, the, new, spain, more, than, an, estimated, 240, 000, aztecs, died, during, the, siege, of, tenochtitlan, 100, 000, in, combat, while, 500, 1, 000, of, the, spaniards, engaged, in, the, conquest, died, the, other, great, conquest, was, of, the, inca, empire, 1531, 35, led, by, francisco, pizarro, during, the, early, period, of, exploration, conquest, and, settlement, c, 1492, 1550, the, overseas, possessions, claimed, by, spain, were, only, loosely, controlled, by, the, crown, with, the, conquests, of, the, aztecs, and, the, incas, the, new, world, now, commanded, the, crown, s, attention, both, mexico, and, peru, had, dense, hierarchically, organized, indigenous, populations, that, could, be, incorporated, and, ruled, even, more, importantly, both, mexico, and, peru, had, large, deposits, of, silver, which, became, the, economic, motor, of, the, spanish, empire, and, transformed, the, world, economy, in, peru, the, singular, hugely, rich, silver, mine, of, potos, was, worked, by, traditional, forced, indigenous, labor, drafts, known, as, the, mit, a, in, mexico, silver, was, found, outside, the, zone, of, dense, indigenous, settlement, so, that, free, laborers, migrated, to, the, mines, in, guanajuato, and, zacatecas, the, crown, established, the, council, of, the, indies, in, 1524, based, in, seville, and, issued, laws, of, the, indies, to, assert, its, power, against, the, early, conquerors, the, crown, created, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, and, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, to, tightened, crown, control, over, these, rich, prizes, of, conquest, over, this, same, time, frame, as, spain, portugal, claimed, lands, in, north, america, canada, and, colonized, much, of, eastern, south, america, naming, it, santa, cruz, and, brazil, on, behalf, of, both, the, portuguese, and, spanish, crowns, cartographer, amerigo, vespucci, explored, the, south, american, east, coast, and, published, his, new, book, mundus, novus, new, world, in, 1502, 1503, which, disproved, the, belief, that, the, americas, were, the, easternmost, part, of, asia, and, confirmed, that, columbus, had, reached, a, set, of, continents, previously, unheard, of, to, any, europeans, cartographers, still, use, a, latinized, version, of, his, first, name, america, for, the, two, continents, in, april, 1500, portuguese, noble, pedro, lvares, cabral, claimed, the, region, of, brazil, to, portugal, the, effective, colonization, of, brazil, began, three, decades, later, with, the, founding, of, s, o, vicente, in, 1532, and, the, establishment, of, the, system, of, captaincies, in, 1534, which, was, later, replaced, by, other, systems, others, tried, to, colonize, the, eastern, coasts, of, present, day, canada, and, the, river, plate, in, south, america, these, explorers, include, jo, o, vaz, corte, real, in, newfoundland, jo, o, fernandes, lavrador, gaspar, and, miguel, corte, real, and, jo, o, lvares, fagundes, in, newfoundland, greenland, labrador, and, nova, scotia, from, 1498, to, 1502, and, in, 1520, during, this, time, the, portuguese, gradually, switched, from, an, initial, plan, of, establishing, trading, posts, to, extensive, colonization, of, what, is, now, brazil, they, imported, millions, of, slaves, to, run, their, plantations, the, portuguese, and, spanish, royal, governments, expected, to, rule, these, settlements, and, collect, at, least, 20, of, all, treasure, found, the, quinto, real, collected, by, the, casa, de, contrataci, n, in, addition, to, collecting, all, the, taxes, they, could, by, the, late, 16th, century, silver, from, the, americas, accounted, for, one, fifth, of, the, combined, total, budget, of, portugal, and, spain, in, the, 16th, century, perhaps, 240, 000, europeans, entered, ports, in, the, americas, france, founded, colonies, in, the, americas, in, eastern, north, america, which, had, not, been, colonized, by, spain, north, of, florida, a, number, of, caribbean, islands, which, had, often, already, been, conquered, by, the, spanish, or, depopulated, by, disease, and, small, coastal, parts, of, south, america, explorers, included, giovanni, da, verrazzano, in, 1524, jacques, cartier, 1491, 1557, and, samuel, de, champlain, 1567, 1635, who, explored, the, region, of, canada, he, reestablished, as, new, france, the, first, french, colonial, empire, stretched, to, over, 10, 000, 000, km, 2, 3, 900, 000, sq, mi, at, its, peak, in, 1710, which, was, the, second, largest, colonial, empire, in, the, world, after, the, spanish, empire, in, the, french, colonial, regions, the, focus, of, economy, was, on, sugar, plantations, in, the, french, west, indies, in, canada, the, fur, trade, with, the, natives, was, important, about, 16, 000, french, men, and, women, became, colonizers, the, great, majority, became, subsistence, farmers, along, the, st, lawrence, river, with, a, favorable, disease, environment, and, plenty, of, land, and, food, their, numbers, grew, exponentially, to, 65, 000, by, 1760, their, colony, was, taken, over, by, britain, in, 1760, but, social, religious, legal, cultural, and, economic, changes, were, few, in, a, society, that, clung, tightly, to, its, recently, formed, traditions, british, colonization, began, with, north, america, almost, a, century, after, spain, the, relatively, late, arrival, meant, that, the, british, could, use, the, other, european, colonization, powers, as, models, for, their, endeavors, inspired, by, the, spanish, riches, from, colonies, founded, upon, the, conquest, of, the, aztecs, incas, and, other, large, native, american, populations, in, the, 16th, century, their, first, attempt, at, colonization, occurred, in, roanoke, and, newfoundland, although, unsuccessful, in, 1606, king, james, i, granted, a, charter, with, the, purpose, of, discovering, the, riches, at, their, first, permanent, settlement, in, jamestown, virginia, in, 1607, they, were, sponsored, by, common, stock, companies, such, as, the, chartered, virginia, company, financed, by, wealthy, englishmen, who, exaggerated, the, economic, potential, of, the, land, the, reformation, of, the, 16th, century, broke, the, unity, of, western, christendom, and, led, to, the, formation, of, numerous, new, religious, sects, which, often, faced, persecution, by, governmental, authorities, in, england, many, people, came, to, question, the, organization, of, the, church, of, england, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, one, of, the, primary, manifestations, of, this, was, the, puritan, movement, which, sought, to, purify, the, existing, church, of, england, of, its, residual, catholic, rites, the, first, of, these, people, known, as, the, pilgrims, landed, on, plymouth, rock, in, november, 1620, continuous, waves, of, repression, led, to, the, migration, of, about, 20, 000, puritans, to, new, england, between, 1629, and, 1642, where, they, founded, multiple, colonies, later, in, the, century, the, new, province, of, pennsylvania, was, given, to, william, penn, in, settlement, of, a, debt, the, king, owed, his, father, its, government, was, established, by, william, penn, in, about, 1682, to, become, primarily, a, refuge, for, persecuted, english, quakers, but, others, were, welcomed, baptists, german, and, swiss, protestants, and, anabaptists, also, flocked, to, pennsylvania, the, lure, of, cheap, land, religious, freedom, and, the, right, to, improve, themselves, with, their, own, hand, was, very, attractive, mainly, due, to, discrimination, there, was, often, a, separation, between, english, colonial, communities, and, indigenous, communities, the, europeans, viewed, the, natives, as, savages, who, were, not, worthy, of, participating, in, what, they, considered, civilized, society, the, native, people, of, north, america, did, not, die, out, nearly, as, rapidly, nor, as, greatly, as, those, in, central, and, south, america, due, in, part, to, their, exclusion, from, british, society, the, indigenous, people, continued, to, be, stripped, of, their, native, lands, and, were, pushed, further, out, west, the, english, eventually, went, on, to, control, much, of, eastern, north, america, the, caribbean, and, parts, of, south, america, they, also, gained, florida, and, quebec, in, the, french, and, indian, war, john, smith, convinced, the, colonists, of, jamestown, that, searching, for, gold, was, not, taking, care, of, their, immediate, needs, for, food, and, shelter, the, lack, of, food, security, leading, to, extremely, high, mortality, rate, was, quite, distressing, and, cause, for, despair, among, the, colonists, to, support, the, colony, numerous, supply, missions, were, organized, tobacco, later, became, a, cash, crop, with, the, work, of, john, rolfe, and, others, for, export, and, the, sustaining, economic, driver, of, virginia, and, the, neighboring, colony, of, maryland, plantation, agriculture, was, a, primary, aspect, of, the, economies, of, the, southern, colonies, and, in, the, british, west, indies, they, heavily, relied, on, african, slave, labor, to, sustain, their, economic, pursuits, from, the, beginning, of, virginia, s, settlements, in, 1587, until, the, 1680s, the, main, source, of, labor, and, a, large, portion, of, the, immigrants, were, indentured, servants, looking, for, new, life, in, the, overseas, colonies, during, the, 17th, century, indentured, servants, constituted, three, quarters, of, all, european, immigrants, to, the, chesapeake, colonies, most, of, the, indentured, servants, were, teenagers, from, england, with, poor, economic, prospects, at, home, their, fathers, signed, the, papers, that, gave, them, free, passage, to, america, and, an, unpaid, job, until, they, became, of, age, they, were, given, food, clothing, housing, and, taught, farming, or, household, skills, american, landowners, were, in, need, of, laborers, and, were, willing, to, pay, for, a, laborer, s, passage, to, america, if, they, served, them, for, several, years, by, selling, passage, for, five, to, seven, years, worth, of, work, they, could, then, start, on, their, own, in, america, many, of, the, migrants, from, england, died, in, the, first, few, years, economic, advantage, also, prompted, the, darien, scheme, an, ill, fated, venture, by, the, kingdom, of, scotland, to, settle, the, isthmus, of, panama, in, the, late, 1690s, the, darien, scheme, aimed, to, control, trade, through, that, part, of, the, world, and, thereby, promote, scotland, into, a, world, trading, power, however, it, was, doomed, by, poor, planning, short, provisions, weak, leadership, lack, of, demand, for, trade, goods, and, devastating, disease, the, failure, of, the, darien, scheme, was, one, of, the, factors, that, led, the, kingdom, of, scotland, into, the, act, of, union, 1707, with, the, kingdom, of, england, creating, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, giving, scotland, commercial, access, to, english, now, british, colonies, the, netherlands, had, been, part, of, the, spanish, empire, due, to, the, inheritance, of, charles, v, of, spain, many, dutch, people, converted, to, protestantism, and, sought, their, political, independence, from, spain, they, were, a, seafaring, nation, and, built, a, global, empire, in, regions, where, the, portuguese, had, originally, explored, in, the, dutch, golden, age, it, sought, colonies, in, the, americas, the, dutch, conquered, the, northeast, of, brazil, in, 1630, where, the, portuguese, had, built, sugar, cane, plantations, worked, by, black, slave, labor, from, africa, prince, johan, maurits, van, nassau, siegen, became, the, administrator, of, the, colony, 1637, 43, building, a, capital, city, and, royal, palace, fully, expecting, the, dutch, to, retain, control, of, this, rich, area, as, the, dutch, had, in, europe, it, tolerated, the, presence, of, jews, and, other, religious, groups, in, the, colony, after, maurits, departed, in, 1643, the, dutch, west, india, company, took, over, the, colony, until, it, was, lost, to, the, portuguese, in, 1654, the, dutch, retained, some, territory, in, dutch, guiana, now, suriname, the, dutch, also, seized, islands, in, the, caribbean, that, spain, had, originally, claimed, but, had, largely, abandoned, including, sint, maarten, in, 1618, bonaire, in, 1634, cura, ao, in, 1634, sint, eustatius, in, 1636, aruba, in, 1637, some, of, which, remain, in, dutch, hands, and, retain, dutch, cultural, traditions, on, the, east, coast, of, north, america, the, dutch, planted, the, colony, of, new, netherland, on, the, lower, end, of, the, island, of, manhattan, at, new, amsterdam, starting, in, 1624, the, dutch, sought, to, protect, their, investments, and, purchased, the, manhattan, from, a, band, of, canarse, from, brooklyn, who, occupied, the, bottom, quarter, of, manhattan, known, then, as, the, manhattoes, for, 60, guilders, worth, of, trade, goods, minuit, conducted, the, transaction, with, the, canarse, chief, seyseys, who, accepted, valuable, merchandise, in, exchange, for, an, island, that, was, actually, mostly, controlled, by, another, indigenous, group, the, weckquaesgeeks, dutch, fur, traders, set, up, a, network, upstream, on, the, hudson, river, there, were, jewish, settlers, from, 1654, onward, and, they, remained, following, the, english, capture, of, new, amsterdam, in, 1664, the, naval, capture, was, despite, both, nations, being, at, peace, with, the, other,

furs, of, ermine, sable, and, fox, cossacks, enlisted, the, aid, of, indigenous, siberians, who, sought, protection, from, nomadic, peoples, and, those, peoples, paid, tribute, in, fur, to, the, czar, thus, prior, to, the, eighteenth, century, russian, expansion, that, pushed, beyond, the, bering, strait, dividing, eurasia, from, north, america, russia, had, experience, with, northern, indigenous, peoples, and, accumulated, wealth, from, the, hunting, of, fur, bearing, animals, siberia, had, already, attracted, a, core, group, of, scientists, who, sought, to, map, and, catalogue, the, flora, fauna, and, other, aspects, of, the, natural, world, a, major, russian, expedition, for, exploration, was, mounted, in, 1742, contemporaneous, with, other, eighteenth, century, european, state, sponsored, ventures, it, was, not, clear, at, the, time, whether, eurasia, and, north, america, were, completely, separate, continents, the, first, voyages, were, made, by, vitus, bering, and, aleksei, chirikov, with, settlement, beginning, after, 1743, by, the, 1790s, the, first, permanent, settlements, were, established, explorations, continued, down, the, pacific, coast, of, north, america, and, russia, established, a, settlement, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, at, what, is, now, called, fort, ross, california, russian, fur, traders, forced, indigenous, aleut, men, into, seasonal, labor, never, very, profitable, russia, sold, its, north, american, holdings, to, the, united, states, in, 1867, called, at, the, time, seward, s, folly, duke, ferdinand, i, de, medici, made, the, only, italian, attempt, to, create, colonies, in, america, for, this, purpose, the, grand, duke, organized, in, 1608, an, expedition, to, the, north, of, brazil, under, the, command, of, the, english, captain, robert, thornton, thornton, on, his, return, from, the, preparatory, trip, in, 1609, he, had, been, to, the, amazon, found, ferdinand, i, dead, and, all, projects, were, canceled, by, his, successor, cosimo, ii, beginning, with, the, first, wave, of, european, colonization, the, religious, discrimination, persecution, and, violence, toward, the, indigenous, peoples, native, religions, was, systematically, perpetrated, by, the, european, christian, colonists, and, settlers, from, the, 15th, 16th, centuries, onwards, during, the, age, of, discovery, and, the, following, centuries, the, spanish, and, portuguese, colonial, empires, were, the, most, active, in, attempting, to, convert, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, to, the, christian, religion, pope, alexander, vi, issued, the, inter, caetera, bull, in, may, 1493, that, confirmed, the, lands, claimed, by, the, kingdom, of, spain, and, mandated, in, exchange, that, the, indigenous, peoples, be, converted, to, catholic, christianity, during, columbus, s, second, voyage, benedictine, friars, accompanied, him, along, with, twelve, other, priests, with, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, evangelization, of, the, dense, indigenous, populations, was, undertaken, in, what, was, called, the, spiritual, conquest, several, mendicant, orders, were, involved, in, the, early, campaign, to, convert, the, indigenous, peoples, franciscans, and, dominicans, learned, indigenous, languages, of, the, americas, such, as, nahuatl, mixtec, and, zapotec, one, of, the, first, schools, for, indigenous, peoples, in, mexico, was, founded, by, pedro, de, gante, in, 1523, the, friars, aimed, at, converting, indigenous, leaders, with, the, hope, and, expectation, that, their, communities, would, follow, suit, in, densely, populated, regions, friars, mobilized, indigenous, communities, to, build, churches, making, the, religious, change, visible, these, churches, and, chapels, were, often, in, the, same, places, as, old, temples, often, using, the, same, stones, native, peoples, exhibited, a, range, of, responses, from, outright, hostility, to, active, embrace, of, the, new, religion, in, central, and, southern, mexico, where, there, was, an, existing, indigenous, tradition, of, creating, written, texts, the, friars, taught, indigenous, scribes, to, write, their, own, languages, in, latin, letters, there, is, significant, body, of, texts, in, indigenous, languages, created, by, and, for, indigenous, peoples, in, their, own, communities, for, their, own, purposes, in, frontier, areas, where, there, were, no, settled, indigenous, populations, friars, and, jesuits, often, created, missions, bringing, together, dispersed, indigenous, populations, in, communities, supervised, by, the, friars, in, order, to, more, easily, preach, the, gospel, and, ensure, their, adherence, to, the, faith, these, missions, were, established, throughout, spanish, america, which, extended, from, the, southwestern, portions, of, current, day, united, states, through, mexico, and, to, argentina, and, chile, as, slavery, was, prohibited, between, christians, and, could, only, be, imposed, upon, non, christian, prisoners, of, war, and, or, men, already, sold, as, slaves, the, debate, on, christianization, was, particularly, acute, during, the, early, 16th, century, when, spanish, conquerors, and, settlers, sought, to, mobilize, indigenous, labor, later, two, dominican, friars, bartolom, de, las, casas, and, the, philosopher, juan, gin, s, de, sep, lveda, held, the, valladolid, debate, with, the, former, arguing, that, native, americans, were, endowed, with, souls, like, all, other, human, beings, while, the, latter, argued, to, the, contrary, to, justify, their, enslavement, in, 1537, the, papal, bull, sublimis, deus, definitively, recognized, that, native, americans, possessed, souls, thus, prohibiting, their, enslavement, without, putting, an, end, to, the, debate, some, claimed, that, a, native, who, had, rebelled, and, then, been, captured, could, be, enslaved, nonetheless, when, the, first, franciscans, arrived, in, mexico, in, 1524, they, burned, the, sacred, places, dedicated, to, the, indigenous, peoples, native, religions, however, in, pre, columbian, mexico, burning, the, temple, of, a, conquered, group, was, standard, practice, shown, in, indigenous, manuscripts, such, as, codex, mendoza, conquered, indigenous, groups, expected, to, take, on, the, gods, of, their, new, overlords, adding, them, to, the, existing, pantheon, they, likely, were, unaware, that, their, conversion, to, christianity, entailed, the, complete, and, irrevocable, renunciation, of, their, ancestral, religious, beliefs, and, practices, in, 1539, mexican, bishop, juan, de, zum, rraga, oversaw, the, trial, and, execution, of, the, indigenous, nobleman, carlos, of, texcoco, for, apostasy, from, christianity, following, that, the, catholic, church, removed, indigenous, converts, from, the, jurisdiction, of, the, inquisition, since, it, had, a, chilling, effect, on, evangelization, in, creating, a, protected, group, of, christians, indigenous, men, no, longer, could, aspire, to, be, ordained, christian, priests, throughout, the, americas, the, jesuits, were, active, in, attempting, to, convert, the, indigenous, peoples, to, christianity, they, had, considerable, success, on, the, frontiers, in, new, france, and, portuguese, brazil, most, famously, with, antonio, de, vieira, s, j, and, in, paraguay, almost, an, autonomous, state, within, a, state, the, mamusse, wunneetupanatamwe, up, biblum, god, a, translation, by, john, eliot, of, the, gospel, into, algonquian, was, published, in, 1663, roman, catholics, were, the, first, major, religious, group, to, immigrate, to, the, new, world, as, settlers, in, the, spanish, and, portuguese, colonies, of, portugal, and, spain, and, later, france, in, new, france, no, other, religion, was, tolerated, and, there, was, a, concerted, effort, to, convert, indigenous, peoples, and, black, slaves, to, catholicism, the, catholic, church, established, three, offices, of, the, spanish, inquisition, in, mexico, city, lima, peru, and, cartagena, de, indias, in, colombia, to, maintain, religious, orthodoxy, and, practice, the, portuguese, did, not, establish, a, permanent, office, of, the, portuguese, inquisition, in, brazil, but, did, send, visitations, of, inquistors, in, the, seventeenth, century, english, and, dutch, colonies, on, the, other, hand, tended, to, be, more, religiously, diverse, settlers, to, these, colonies, included, anglicans, dutch, calvinists, english, puritans, and, other, nonconformists, english, catholics, scottish, presbyterians, french, protestant, huguenots, german, and, swedish, lutherans, as, well, as, jews, quakers, mennonites, amish, and, moravians, jews, fled, to, the, dutch, colony, of, new, amsterdam, when, the, spanish, and, portuguese, inquisitions, cracked, down, on, their, presence, the, european, lifestyle, included, a, long, history, of, sharing, close, quarters, with, domesticated, animals, such, as, cows, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, and, various, domesticated, fowl, from, which, many, diseases, originally, stemmed, in, contrast, to, the, indigenous, people, the, europeans, had, developed, a, richer, endowment, of, antibodies, the, large, scale, contact, with, europeans, after, 1492, introduced, eurasian, germs, to, the, indigenous, people, of, the, americas, epidemics, of, smallpox, 1518, 1521, 1525, 1558, 1589, typhus, 1546, influenza, 1558, diphtheria, 1614, and, measles, 1618, swept, the, americas, subsequent, to, european, contact, killing, between, 10, million, and, 100, million, people, up, to, 95, of, the, indigenous, population, of, the, americas, the, cultural, and, political, instability, attending, these, losses, appears, to, have, been, of, substantial, aid, in, the, efforts, of, various, colonists, in, new, england, and, massachusetts, to, acquire, control, over, the, great, wealth, in, land, and, resources, of, which, indigenous, societies, had, customarily, made, use, such, diseases, yielded, human, mortality, of, an, unquestionably, enormous, gravity, and, scale, and, this, has, profoundly, confused, efforts, to, determine, its, full, extent, with, any, true, precision, estimates, of, the, pre, columbian, population, of, the, americas, vary, tremendously, others, have, argued, that, significant, variations, in, population, size, over, pre, columbian, history, are, reason, to, view, higher, end, estimates, with, caution, such, estimates, may, reflect, historical, population, maxima, while, indigenous, populations, may, have, been, at, a, level, somewhat, below, these, maxima, or, in, a, moment, of, decline, in, the, period, just, prior, to, contact, with, europeans, indigenous, populations, hit, their, ultimate, lows, in, most, areas, of, the, americas, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, a, number, of, cases, growth, has, returned, according, to, scientists, from, university, college, london, the, colonization, of, the, americas, by, europeans, killed, so, much, of, the, indigenous, population, that, it, resulted, in, climate, change, and, global, cooling, some, contemporary, scholars, also, attribute, significant, indigenous, population, losses, in, the, caribbean, to, the, widespread, practice, of, slavery, and, deadly, forced, labor, in, gold, and, silver, mines, historian, andr, s, res, ndez, supports, this, claim, and, argues, that, indigenous, populations, were, smaller, previous, estimations, and, a, nexus, of, slavery, overwork, and, famine, killed, more, indians, in, the, caribbean, than, smallpox, influenza, and, malaria, indigenous, population, loss, following, european, contact, directly, led, to, spanish, explorations, beyond, the, caribbean, islands, they, initially, claimed, and, settled, in, the, 1490s, since, they, required, a, labor, force, to, both, produce, food, and, to, mine, gold, slavery, was, not, unknown, in, indigenous, societies, with, the, arrival, of, european, colonists, enslavement, of, indigenous, peoples, became, commodified, expanded, in, unexpected, ways, and, came, to, resemble, the, kinds, of, human, trafficking, that, are, recognizable, to, us, today, while, disease, was, the, main, killer, of, indigenous, peoples, the, practice, of, slavery, and, forced, labor, was, also, significant, contributor, to, the, indigenous, death, toll, with, the, arrival, of, europeans, other, than, spanish, enslavement, of, native, populations, increased, since, there, were, no, prohibitions, against, slavery, until, decades, later, it, is, estimated, that, from, columbus, s, arrival, to, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, between, 2, 5, and, 5, million, native, americans, were, forced, into, slavery, indigenous, men, women, and, children, were, often, forced, into, labor, in, sparsely, populated, frontier, settings, in, the, household, or, in, the, toxic, gold, and, silver, mines, this, practice, was, known, as, the, encomienda, system, and, granted, free, native, labor, to, the, spaniards, based, upon, the, practice, of, exacting, tribute, from, muslims, and, jews, during, the, reconquista, the, spanish, crown, granted, a, number, of, native, laborers, to, an, encomendero, who, was, usually, a, conquistador, or, other, prominent, spanish, male, under, the, grant, they, were, theoretically, bound, to, both, protecting, the, natives, and, converting, them, to, christianity, in, exchange, for, their, forced, conversion, to, christianity, the, natives, paid, tributes, in, the, form, of, gold, agricultural, products, and, labor, the, spanish, crown, tried, to, terminate, the, system, through, the, laws, of, burgos, 1512, 13, and, the, new, laws, of, the, indies, 1542, however, the, encomenderos, refused, to, comply, with, the, new, measures, and, the, indigenous, people, continued, to, be, exploited, eventually, the, encomienda, system, was, replaced, by, the, repartimiento, system, which, was, not, abolished, until, the, late, 18th, century, in, the, caribbean, deposits, of, gold, were, quickly, exhausted, and, the, precipitous, drop, in, the, indigenous, population, meant, a, severe, labor, shortage, spaniards, sought, a, high, value, low, bulk, export, product, to, make, their, fortunes, cane, sugar, was, the, answer, it, had, been, cultivated, on, the, iberian, atlantic, islands, it, was, a, highly, desirable, expensive, foodstuff, the, problem, of, a, labor, force, was, solved, by, the, importation, of, african, slaves, initiating, the, creation, of, sugar, plantations, worked, by, chattel, slaves, plantations, required, a, significant, work, force, to, be, purchased, housed, and, fed, capital, investment, in, building, sugar, mills, on, site, since, once, cane, was, cut, the, sugar, content, rapidly, declined, plantation, owners, were, linked, to, creditors, and, a, network, of, merchants, to, sell, processed, sugar, in, europe, the, whole, system, was, predicated, on, a, huge, enslaved, population, the, portuguese, controlled, the, african, slave, trade, since, the, division, of, spheres, with, spain, in, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, they, controlled, the, african, coasts, black, slavery, dominated, the, labor, force, in, tropical, zones, particularly, where, sugar, was, cultivated, in, portuguese, brazil, the, english, french, and, dutch, caribbean, islands, on, the, mainland, of, north, america, the, english, southern, colonies, imported, black, slaves, starting, in, virginia, in, 1619, to, cultivate, other, tropical, or, semi, tropical, crops, such, as, tobacco, rice, and, cotton, although, black, slavery, is, most, associated, with, agricultural, production, in, spanish, america, enslaved, and, free, blacks, and, mulattoes, were, found, in, numbers, in, cities, working, as, artisans, most, newly, transported, african, slaves, were, not, christians, but, their, conversion, was, a, priority, for, the, catholic, church, black, slavery, was, not, incompatible, with, christianity, the, jesuits, created, hugely, profitable, agricultural, enterprises, and, held, a, significant, black, slave, labor, force, european, whites, often, justified, the, practice, through, the, belts, of, latitude, theory, supported, by, aristotle, and, ptolemy, in, this, perspective, belts, of, latitude, wrapped, around, the, earth, and, corresponded, with, specific, human, traits, the, peoples, from, the, cold, zone, in, northern, europe, were, of, lesser, prudence, while, those, of, the, hot, zone, in, sub, sahara, africa, were, intelligent, but, weaker, and, less, spirited, according, to, the, theory, those, of, the, temperate, zone, across, the, mediterranean, reflected, an, ideal, balance, of, strength, and, prudence, such, ideas, about, latitude, and, character, justified, a, natural, human, hierarchy, african, slaves, were, a, highly, valuable, commodity, enriching, those, involved, in, the, trade, africans, were, transported, to, slave, ships, to, the, americas, were, primarily, obtained, from, their, african, homelands, by, coastal, tribes, who, captured, and, sold, them, europeans, traded, for, slaves, with, the, local, native, african, tribes, who, captured, them, elsewhere, in, exchange, for, rum, guns, gunpowder, and, other, manufactures, the, total, slave, trade, to, islands, in, the, caribbean, brazil, the, portuguese, spanish, french, dutch, and, british, empires, is, estimated, to, have, involved, 12, million, africans, the, vast, majority, of, these, slaves, went, to, sugar, colonies, in, the, caribbean, and, to, brazil, where, life, expectancy, was, short, and, the, numbers, had, to, be, continually, replenished, at, most, about, 600, 000, african, slaves, were, imported, into, the, united, states, or, 5, of, the, 12, million, slaves, brought, across, from, africa, throughout, the, south, american, hemisphere, there, were, three, large, regional, sources, of, populations, native, americans, arriving, europeans, and, forcibly, transported, africans, the, mixture, of, these, cultures, impacted, the, ethnic, makeup, that, predominates, in, the, hemisphere, s, largely, independent, states, today, the, term, to, describe, someone, of, mixed, european, and, indigenous, ancestry, is, mestizo, while, the, term, to, describe, someone, of, mixed, european, and, african, ancestry, is, mulatto, the, mestizo, and, mulatto, population, are, specific, to, iberian, influenced, current, day, latin, america, because, the, conquistadors, had, often, forced, sexual, relations, with, the, indigenous, and, african, women, the, social, interaction, of, these, three, groups, of, people, inspired, the, creation, of, a, caste, system, based, on, skin, tone, the, hierarchy, centered, around, those, with, the, lightest, skin, tone, and, ordered, from, highest, to, lowest, was, the, peninsulares, criollos, mestizos, indigenous, mulatto, then, african, unlike, the, iberians, the, british, men, came, with, families, with, whom, they, planned, to, permanently, live, in, what, is, now, north, america, they, kept, the, natives, on, the, margins, of, colonial, society, because, the, british, colonizers, wives, were, present, the, british, men, rarely, had, sexual, relations, with, the, native, women, while, the, mestizo, and, mulatto, population, make, up, the, majority, of, people, in, latin, america, today, there, is, only, a, small, mestizo, population, in, present, day, north, america, excluding, central, america, by, the, early, to, mid, 16th, century, even, the, iberian, men, began, to, carry, their, wives, and, families, to, the, americas, some, women, even, carried, out, the, voyage, alone, later, more, studies, of, the, role, of, women, and, female, migration, from, europe, to, the, americas, have, been, made, eventually, most, of, the, western, hemisphere, came, under, the, control, of, western, european, governments, leading, to, changes, to, its, landscape, population, and, plant, and, animal, life, in, the, 19th, century, over, 50, million, people, left, western, europe, for, the, americas, the, post, 1492, era, is, known, as, the, period, of, the, columbian, exchange, a, dramatically, widespread, exchange, of, animals, plants, culture, human, populations, including, slaves, ideas, and, communicable, disease, between, the, american, and, afro, eurasian, hemispheres, following, columbus, s, voyages, to, the, americas, most, scholars, writing, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, estimated, that, the, pre, columbian, population, was, as, low, as, 10, million, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, most, scholars, gravitated, to, a, middle, estimate, of, around, 50, million, with, some, historians, arguing, for, an, estimate, of, 100, million, or, more, a, recent, estimate, is, that, there, were, about, 60, 5, million, people, living, in, the, americas, immediately, before, depopulation, of, which, 90, per, cent, mostly, in, central, and, south, america, perished, from, wave, after, wave, of, disease, along, with, war, and, slavery, playing, their, part, geographic, differences, between, the, colonies, played, a, large, determinant, in, the, types, of, political, and, economic, systems, that, later, developed, in, their, paper, on, institutions, and, long, run, growth, economists, daron, acemoglu, simon, johnson, and, james, a, robinson, argue, that, certain, natural, endowments, gave, rise, to, distinct, colonial, policies, promoting, either, smallholder, or, coerced, labor, production, densely, settled, populations, for, example, were, more, easily, exploitable, and, profitable, as, slave, labor, in, these, regions, landowning, elites, were, economically, incentivized, to, develop, forced, labor, arrangements, such, as, the, peru, mit, a, system, or, argentinian, latifundias, without, regard, for, democratic, norms, french, and, british, colonial, leaders, conversely, were, incentivized, to, develop, capitalist, markets, property, rights, and, democratic, institutions, in, response, to, natural, environments, that, supported, smallholder, production, over, forced, labor, james, mahoney, proposes, that, colonial, policy, choices, made, at, critical, junctures, regarding, land, ownership, in, coffee, rich, central, america, fostered, enduring, path, dependent, institutions, coffee, economies, in, guatemala, and, el, salvador, for, example, were, centralized, around, large, plantations, that, operated, under, coercive, labor, systems, by, the, 19th, century, their, political, structures, were, largely, authoritarian, and, militarized, in, colombia, and, costa, rica, conversely, liberal, reforms, were, enacted, at, critical, junctures, to, expand, commercial, agriculture, and, they, ultimately, raised, the, bargaining, power, of, the, middle, class, both, nations, eventually, developed, more, democratic, and, egalitarian, institutions, than, their, highly, concentrated, landowning, counterparts, there, were, at, least, a, dozen, european, countries, involved, in, the, colonization, of, the, americas, the, following, list, indicates,
