the, history, of, science, covers, the, development, of, science, from, ancient, times, to, the, present, it, encompasses, all, three, major, branches, of, science, natural, social, and, formal, protoscience, early, sciences, and, natural, philosophies, such, as, alchemy, and, astrology, during, the, bronze, age, iron, age, classical, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, declined, during, the, early, modern, period, after, the, establishment, of, formal, disciplines, of, science, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, science, s, earliest, roots, can, be, traced, to, ancient, egypt, and, mesopotamia, around, 3000, to, 1200, bce, these, civilizations, contributions, to, mathematics, astronomy, and, medicine, influenced, later, greek, natural, philosophy, of, classical, antiquity, wherein, formal, attempts, were, made, to, provide, explanations, of, events, in, the, physical, world, based, on, natural, causes, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, knowledge, of, greek, conceptions, of, the, world, deteriorated, in, latin, speaking, western, europe, during, the, early, centuries, 400, to, 1000, ce, of, the, middle, ages, but, continued, to, thrive, in, the, greek, speaking, byzantine, empire, aided, by, translations, of, greek, texts, the, hellenistic, worldview, was, preserved, and, absorbed, into, the, arabic, speaking, muslim, world, during, the, islamic, golden, age, the, recovery, and, assimilation, of, greek, works, and, islamic, inquiries, into, western, europe, from, the, 10th, to, 13th, century, revived, the, learning, of, natural, philosophy, in, the, west, traditions, of, early, science, were, also, developed, in, ancient, india, and, separately, in, ancient, china, the, chinese, model, having, influenced, vietnam, korea, and, japan, before, western, exploration, among, the, pre, columbian, peoples, of, mesoamerica, the, zapotec, civilization, established, their, first, known, traditions, of, astronomy, and, mathematics, for, producing, calendars, followed, by, other, civilizations, such, as, the, maya, natural, philosophy, was, transformed, during, the, scientific, revolution, in, 16th, to, 17th, century, europe, as, new, ideas, and, discoveries, departed, from, previous, greek, conceptions, and, traditions, the, new, science, that, emerged, was, more, mechanistic, in, its, worldview, more, integrated, with, mathematics, and, more, reliable, and, open, as, its, knowledge, was, based, on, a, newly, defined, scientific, method, more, revolutions, in, subsequent, centuries, soon, followed, the, chemical, revolution, of, the, 18th, century, for, instance, introduced, new, quantitative, methods, and, measurements, for, chemistry, in, the, 19th, century, new, perspectives, regarding, the, conservation, of, energy, age, of, earth, and, evolution, came, into, focus, and, in, the, 20th, century, new, discoveries, in, genetics, and, physics, laid, the, foundations, for, new, sub, disciplines, such, as, molecular, biology, and, particle, physics, moreover, industrial, and, military, concerns, as, well, as, the, increasing, complexity, of, new, research, endeavors, ushered, in, the, era, of, big, science, particularly, after, world, war, ii, the, nature, of, the, history, of, science, is, a, topic, of, debate, as, is, by, implication, the, definition, of, science, itself, the, history, of, science, is, often, seen, as, a, linear, story, of, progress, but, historians, have, come, to, see, the, story, as, more, complex, alfred, edward, taylor, has, characterised, lean, periods, in, the, advance, of, scientific, discovery, as, periodical, bankruptcies, of, science, science, is, a, human, activity, and, scientific, contributions, have, come, from, people, from, a, wide, range, of, different, backgrounds, and, cultures, historians, of, science, increasingly, see, their, field, as, part, of, a, global, history, of, exchange, conflict, and, collaboration, the, relationship, between, science, and, religion, has, been, variously, characterized, in, terms, of, conflict, harmony, complexity, and, mutual, independence, among, others, events, in, europe, such, as, the, galileo, affair, of, the, early, 17th, century, associated, with, the, scientific, revolution, and, the, age, of, enlightenment, led, scholars, such, as, john, william, draper, to, postulate, c, 1874, a, conflict, thesis, suggesting, that, religion, and, science, have, been, in, conflict, methodologically, factually, and, politically, throughout, history, the, conflict, thesis, has, since, lost, favor, among, the, majority, of, contemporary, scientists, and, historians, of, science, however, some, contemporary, philosophers, and, scientists, such, as, richard, dawkins, still, subscribe, to, this, thesis, historians, have, emphasized, that, trust, is, necessary, for, agreement, on, claims, about, nature, in, this, light, the, 1660, establishment, of, the, royal, society, and, its, code, of, experiment, trustworthy, because, witnessed, by, its, members, has, become, an, important, chapter, in, the, historiography, of, science, many, people, in, modern, history, typically, women, and, persons, of, color, were, excluded, from, elite, scientific, communities, and, characterized, by, the, science, establishment, as, inferior, historians, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, described, the, structural, barriers, to, participation, and, began, to, recover, the, contributions, of, overlooked, individuals, historians, have, also, investigated, the, mundane, practices, of, science, such, as, fieldwork, and, specimen, collection, correspondence, drawing, record, keeping, and, the, use, of, laboratory, and, field, equipment, in, prehistoric, times, knowledge, and, technique, were, passed, from, generation, to, generation, in, an, oral, tradition, for, instance, the, domestication, of, maize, for, agriculture, has, been, dated, to, about, 9, 000, years, ago, in, southern, mexico, before, the, development, of, writing, systems, similarly, archaeological, evidence, indicates, the, development, of, astronomical, knowledge, in, preliterate, societies, the, oral, tradition, of, preliterate, societies, had, several, features, the, first, of, which, was, its, fluidity, new, information, was, constantly, absorbed, and, adjusted, to, new, circumstances, or, community, needs, there, were, no, archives, or, reports, this, fluidity, was, closely, related, to, the, practical, need, to, explain, and, justify, a, present, state, of, affairs, another, feature, was, the, tendency, to, describe, the, universe, as, just, sky, and, earth, with, a, potential, underworld, they, were, also, prone, to, identify, causes, with, beginnings, thereby, providing, a, historical, origin, with, an, explanation, there, was, also, a, reliance, on, a, medicine, man, or, wise, woman, for, healing, knowledge, of, divine, or, demonic, causes, of, diseases, and, in, more, extreme, cases, for, rituals, such, as, exorcism, divination, songs, and, incantations, finally, there, was, an, inclination, to, unquestioningly, accept, explanations, that, might, be, deemed, implausible, in, more, modern, times, while, at, the, same, time, not, being, aware, that, such, credulous, behaviors, could, have, posed, problems, the, development, of, writing, enabled, humans, to, store, and, communicate, knowledge, across, generations, with, much, greater, accuracy, its, invention, was, a, prerequisite, for, the, development, of, philosophy, and, later, science, in, ancient, times, moreover, the, extent, to, which, philosophy, and, science, would, flourish, in, ancient, times, depended, on, the, efficiency, of, a, writing, system, e, g, use, of, alphabets, the, earliest, roots, of, science, can, be, traced, to, the, ancient, near, east, in, particular, ancient, egypt, and, mesopotamia, in, around, 3000, to, 1200, bce, starting, in, around, 3000, bce, the, ancient, egyptians, developed, a, numbering, system, that, was, decimal, in, character, and, had, oriented, their, knowledge, of, geometry, to, solving, practical, problems, such, as, those, of, surveyors, and, builders, their, development, of, geometry, was, itself, a, necessary, development, of, surveying, to, preserve, the, layout, and, ownership, of, farmland, which, was, flooded, annually, by, the, nile, river, the, 3, 4, 5, right, triangle, and, other, rules, of, geometry, were, used, to, build, rectilinear, structures, and, the, post, and, lintel, architecture, of, egypt, egypt, was, also, a, center, of, alchemy, research, for, much, of, the, mediterranean, based, on, the, medical, papyri, written, in, the, 2500, 1200, bce, the, ancient, egyptians, believed, that, disease, was, mainly, caused, by, the, invasion, of, bodies, by, evil, forces, or, spirits, thus, in, addition, to, using, medicines, their, healing, therapies, included, prayer, incantation, and, ritual, the, ebers, papyrus, written, in, around, 1600, bce, contains, medical, recipes, for, treating, diseases, related, to, the, eyes, mouth, skin, internal, organs, and, extremities, as, well, as, abscesses, wounds, burns, ulcers, swollen, glands, tumors, headaches, and, even, bad, breath, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, written, at, about, the, same, time, contains, a, surgical, manual, for, treating, wounds, fractures, and, dislocations, the, egyptians, believed, that, the, effectiveness, of, their, medicines, depended, on, the, preparation, and, administration, under, appropriate, rituals, medical, historians, believe, that, ancient, egyptian, pharmacology, for, example, was, largely, ineffective, both, the, ebers, and, edwin, smith, papyri, applied, the, following, components, to, the, treatment, of, disease, examination, diagnosis, treatment, and, prognosis, which, display, strong, parallels, to, the, basic, empirical, method, of, science, and, according, to, g, e, r, lloyd, played, a, significant, role, in, the, development, of, this, methodology, the, ancient, egyptians, even, developed, an, official, calendar, that, contained, twelve, months, thirty, days, each, and, five, days, at, the, end, of, the, year, unlike, the, babylonian, calendar, or, the, ones, used, in, greek, city, states, at, the, time, the, official, egyptian, calendar, was, much, simpler, as, it, was, fixed, and, did, not, take, lunar, and, solar, cycles, into, consideration, the, ancient, mesopotamians, had, extensive, knowledge, about, the, chemical, properties, of, clay, sand, metal, ore, bitumen, stone, and, other, natural, materials, and, applied, this, knowledge, to, practical, use, in, manufacturing, pottery, faience, glass, soap, metals, lime, plaster, and, waterproofing, metallurgy, required, knowledge, about, the, properties, of, metals, nonetheless, the, mesopotamians, seem, to, have, had, little, interest, in, gathering, information, about, the, natural, world, for, the, mere, sake, of, gathering, information, and, were, far, more, interested, in, studying, the, manner, in, which, the, gods, had, ordered, the, universe, biology, of, non, human, organisms, was, generally, only, written, about, in, the, context, of, mainstream, academic, disciplines, animal, physiology, was, studied, extensively, for, the, purpose, of, divination, the, anatomy, of, the, liver, which, was, seen, as, an, important, organ, in, haruspicy, was, studied, in, particularly, intensive, detail, animal, behavior, was, also, studied, for, divinatory, purposes, most, information, about, the, training, and, domestication, of, animals, was, probably, transmitted, orally, without, being, written, down, but, one, text, dealing, with, the, training, of, horses, has, survived, the, ancient, mesopotamians, had, no, distinction, between, rational, science, and, magic, when, a, person, became, ill, doctors, prescribed, magical, formulas, to, be, recited, as, well, as, medicinal, treatments, the, earliest, medical, prescriptions, appear, in, sumerian, during, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, c, 2112, bce, c, 2004, bce, the, most, extensive, babylonian, medical, text, however, is, the, diagnostic, handbook, written, by, the, umm, n, or, chief, scholar, esagil, kin, apli, of, borsippa, during, the, reign, of, the, babylonian, king, adad, apla, iddina, 1069, 1046, bce, in, east, semitic, cultures, the, main, medicinal, authority, was, a, kind, of, exorcist, healer, known, as, an, ipu, the, profession, was, generally, passed, down, from, father, to, son, and, was, held, in, extremely, high, regard, of, less, frequent, recourse, was, another, kind, of, healer, known, as, an, asu, who, corresponds, more, closely, to, a, modern, physician, and, treated, physical, symptoms, using, primarily, folk, remedies, composed, of, various, herbs, animal, products, and, minerals, as, well, as, potions, enemas, and, ointments, or, poultices, these, physicians, who, could, be, either, male, or, female, also, dressed, wounds, set, limbs, and, performed, simple, surgeries, the, ancient, mesopotamians, also, practiced, prophylaxis, and, took, measures, to, prevent, the, spread, of, disease, in, babylonian, astronomy, records, of, the, motions, of, the, stars, planets, and, the, moon, are, left, on, thousands, of, clay, tablets, created, by, scribes, even, today, astronomical, periods, identified, by, mesopotamian, proto, scientists, are, still, widely, used, in, western, calendars, such, as, the, solar, year, and, the, lunar, month, using, this, data, they, developed, mathematical, methods, to, compute, the, changing, length, of, daylight, in, the, course, of, the, year, predict, the, appearances, and, disappearances, of, the, moon, and, planets, and, eclipses, of, the, sun, and, moon, only, a, few, astronomers, names, are, known, such, as, that, of, kidinnu, a, chaldean, astronomer, and, mathematician, kiddinu, s, value, for, the, solar, year, is, in, use, for, today, s, calendars, babylonian, astronomy, was, the, first, and, highly, successful, attempt, at, giving, a, refined, mathematical, description, of, astronomical, phenomena, according, to, the, historian, a, aaboe, all, subsequent, varieties, of, scientific, astronomy, in, the, hellenistic, world, in, india, in, islam, and, in, the, west, if, not, indeed, all, subsequent, endeavour, in, the, exact, sciences, depend, upon, babylonian, astronomy, in, decisive, and, fundamental, ways, to, the, babylonians, and, other, near, eastern, cultures, messages, from, the, gods, or, omens, were, concealed, in, all, natural, phenomena, that, could, be, deciphered, and, interpreted, by, those, who, are, adept, hence, it, was, believed, that, the, gods, could, speak, through, all, terrestrial, objects, e, g, animal, entrails, dreams, malformed, births, or, even, the, color, of, a, dog, urinating, on, a, person, and, celestial, phenomena, moreover, babylonian, astrology, was, inseparable, from, babylonian, astronomy, the, mesopotamian, cuneiform, tablet, plimpton, 322, dating, to, the, eighteenth, century, bce, records, a, number, of, pythagorean, triplets, 3, 4, 5, 5, 12, 13, hinting, that, the, ancient, mesopotamians, might, have, been, aware, of, the, pythagorean, theorem, over, a, millennium, before, pythagoras, mathematical, achievements, from, mesopotamia, had, some, influence, on, the, development, of, mathematics, in, india, and, there, were, confirmed, transmissions, of, mathematical, ideas, between, india, and, china, which, were, bidirectional, nevertheless, the, mathematical, and, scientific, achievements, in, india, and, particularly, in, china, occurred, largely, independently, from, those, of, europe, and, the, confirmed, early, influences, that, these, two, civilizations, had, on, the, development, of, science, in, europe, in, the, pre, modern, era, were, indirect, with, mesopotamia, and, later, the, islamic, world, acting, as, intermediaries, the, arrival, of, modern, science, which, grew, out, of, the, scientific, revolution, in, india, and, china, and, the, greater, asian, region, in, general, can, be, traced, to, the, scientific, activities, of, jesuit, missionaries, who, were, interested, in, studying, the, region, s, flora, and, fauna, during, the, 16th, to, 17th, century, the, earliest, traces, of, mathematical, knowledge, in, the, indian, subcontinent, appear, with, the, indus, valley, civilisation, c, 4th, millennium, bce, c, 3rd, millennium, bce, the, people, of, this, civilization, made, bricks, whose, dimensions, were, in,

during, the, ming, dynasty, so, that, the, jesuit, matteo, ricci, gained, much, favor, in, 1601, by, his, predictions, by, 635, chinese, astronomers, had, observed, that, the, tails, of, comets, always, point, away, from, the, sun, from, antiquity, the, chinese, used, an, equatorial, system, for, describing, the, skies, and, a, star, map, from, 940, was, drawn, using, a, cylindrical, mercator, projection, the, use, of, an, armillary, sphere, is, recorded, from, the, 4th, century, bce, and, a, sphere, permanently, mounted, in, equatorial, axis, from, 52, bce, in, 125, ce, zhang, heng, used, water, power, to, rotate, the, sphere, in, real, time, this, included, rings, for, the, meridian, and, ecliptic, by, 1270, they, had, incorporated, the, principles, of, the, arab, torquetum, in, the, song, empire, 960, 1279, of, imperial, china, chinese, scholar, officials, unearthed, studied, and, cataloged, ancient, artifacts, to, better, prepare, for, calamities, zhang, heng, invented, a, seismometer, in, 132, ce, which, provided, instant, alert, to, authorities, in, the, capital, luoyang, that, an, earthquake, had, occurred, in, a, location, indicated, by, a, specific, cardinal, or, ordinal, direction, although, no, tremors, could, be, felt, in, the, capital, when, zhang, told, the, court, that, an, earthquake, had, just, occurred, in, the, northwest, a, message, came, soon, afterwards, that, an, earthquake, had, indeed, struck, 400, to, 500, km, 250, to, 310, mi, northwest, of, luoyang, in, what, is, now, modern, gansu, zhang, called, his, device, the, instrument, for, measuring, the, seasonal, winds, and, the, movements, of, the, earth, houfeng, didong, yi, so, named, because, he, and, others, thought, that, earthquakes, were, most, likely, caused, by, the, enormous, compression, of, trapped, air, there, are, many, notable, contributors, to, early, chinese, disciplines, inventions, and, practices, throughout, the, ages, one, of, the, best, examples, would, be, the, medieval, song, chinese, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, a, polymath, and, statesman, who, was, the, first, to, describe, the, magnetic, needle, compass, used, for, navigation, discovered, the, concept, of, true, north, improved, the, design, of, the, astronomical, gnomon, armillary, sphere, sight, tube, and, clepsydra, and, described, the, use, of, drydocks, to, repair, boats, after, observing, the, natural, process, of, the, inundation, of, silt, and, the, find, of, marine, fossils, in, the, taihang, mountains, hundreds, of, miles, from, the, pacific, ocean, shen, kuo, devised, a, theory, of, land, formation, or, geomorphology, he, also, adopted, a, theory, of, gradual, climate, change, in, regions, over, time, after, observing, petrified, bamboo, found, underground, at, yan, an, shaanxi, province, if, not, for, shen, kuo, s, writing, the, architectural, works, of, yu, hao, would, be, little, known, along, with, the, inventor, of, movable, type, printing, bi, sheng, 990, 1051, shen, s, contemporary, su, song, 1020, 1101, was, also, a, brilliant, polymath, an, astronomer, who, created, a, celestial, atlas, of, star, maps, wrote, a, treatise, related, to, botany, zoology, mineralogy, and, metallurgy, and, had, erected, a, large, astronomical, clocktower, in, kaifeng, city, in, 1088, to, operate, the, crowning, armillary, sphere, his, clocktower, featured, an, escapement, mechanism, and, the, world, s, oldest, known, use, of, an, endless, power, transmitting, chain, drive, the, jesuit, china, missions, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, learned, to, appreciate, the, scientific, achievements, of, this, ancient, culture, and, made, them, known, in, europe, through, their, correspondence, european, scientists, first, learned, about, the, chinese, science, and, culture, western, academic, thought, on, the, history, of, chinese, technology, and, science, was, galvanized, by, the, work, of, joseph, needham, and, the, needham, research, institute, among, the, technological, accomplishments, of, china, were, according, to, the, british, scholar, needham, the, water, powered, celestial, globe, zhang, heng, dry, docks, sliding, calipers, the, double, action, piston, pump, the, blast, furnace, the, multi, tube, seed, drill, the, wheelbarrow, the, suspension, bridge, the, winnowing, machine, gunpowder, the, raised, relief, map, toilet, paper, the, efficient, harness, along, with, contributions, in, logic, astronomy, medicine, and, other, fields, however, cultural, factors, prevented, these, chinese, achievements, from, developing, into, modern, science, according, to, needham, it, may, have, been, the, religious, and, philosophical, framework, of, chinese, intellectuals, which, made, them, unable, to, accept, the, ideas, of, laws, of, nature, it, was, not, that, there, was, no, order, in, nature, for, the, chinese, but, rather, that, it, was, not, an, order, ordained, by, a, rational, personal, being, and, hence, there, was, no, conviction, that, rational, personal, beings, would, be, able, to, spell, out, in, their, lesser, earthly, languages, the, divine, code, of, laws, which, he, had, decreed, aforetime, the, taoists, indeed, would, have, scorned, such, an, idea, as, being, too, na, ve, for, the, subtlety, and, complexity, of, the, universe, as, they, intuited, it, during, the, middle, formative, period, c, 900, bce, c, 300, bce, of, pre, columbian, mesoamerica, the, zapotec, civilization, heavily, influenced, by, the, olmec, civilization, established, the, first, known, full, writing, system, of, the, region, possibly, predated, by, the, olmec, cascajal, block, as, well, as, the, first, known, astronomical, calendar, in, mesoamerica, following, a, period, of, initial, urban, development, in, the, preclassical, period, the, classic, maya, civilization, c, 250, ce, c, 900, ce, built, on, the, shared, heritage, of, the, olmecs, by, developing, the, most, sophisticated, systems, of, writing, astronomy, calendrical, science, and, mathematics, among, mesoamerican, peoples, the, maya, developed, a, positional, numeral, system, with, a, base, of, 20, that, included, the, use, of, zero, for, constructing, their, calendars, maya, writing, which, was, developed, by, 200, bce, widespread, by, 100, bce, and, rooted, in, olmec, and, zapotec, scripts, contains, easily, discernible, calendar, dates, in, the, form, of, logographs, representing, numbers, coefficients, and, calendar, periods, amounting, to, 20, days, and, even, 20, years, for, tracking, social, religious, political, and, economic, events, in, 360, day, years, the, contributions, of, the, ancient, egyptians, and, mesopotamians, in, the, areas, of, astronomy, mathematics, and, medicine, had, entered, and, shaped, greek, natural, philosophy, of, classical, antiquity, whereby, formal, attempts, were, made, to, provide, explanations, of, events, in, the, physical, world, based, on, natural, causes, inquiries, were, also, aimed, at, such, practical, goals, such, as, establishing, a, reliable, calendar, or, determining, how, to, cure, a, variety, of, illnesses, the, ancient, people, who, were, considered, the, first, scientists, may, have, thought, of, themselves, as, natural, philosophers, as, practitioners, of, a, skilled, profession, for, example, physicians, or, as, followers, of, a, religious, tradition, for, example, temple, healers, the, earliest, greek, philosophers, known, as, the, pre, socratics, provided, competing, answers, to, the, question, found, in, the, myths, of, their, neighbors, how, did, the, ordered, cosmos, in, which, we, live, come, to, be, the, pre, socratic, philosopher, thales, 640, 546, bce, of, miletus, identified, by, later, authors, such, as, aristotle, as, the, first, of, the, ionian, philosophers, postulated, non, supernatural, explanations, for, natural, phenomena, for, example, that, land, floats, on, water, and, that, earthquakes, are, caused, by, the, agitation, of, the, water, upon, which, the, land, floats, rather, than, the, god, poseidon, thales, student, pythagoras, of, samos, founded, the, pythagorean, school, which, investigated, mathematics, for, its, own, sake, and, was, the, first, to, postulate, that, the, earth, is, spherical, in, shape, leucippus, 5th, century, bce, introduced, atomism, the, theory, that, all, matter, is, made, of, indivisible, imperishable, units, called, atoms, this, was, greatly, expanded, on, by, his, pupil, democritus, and, later, epicurus, plato, and, aristotle, produced, the, first, systematic, discussions, of, natural, philosophy, which, did, much, to, shape, later, investigations, of, nature, their, development, of, deductive, reasoning, was, of, particular, importance, and, usefulness, to, later, scientific, inquiry, plato, founded, the, platonic, academy, in, 387, bce, whose, motto, was, let, none, unversed, in, geometry, enter, here, and, also, turned, out, many, notable, philosophers, plato, s, student, aristotle, introduced, empiricism, and, the, notion, that, universal, truths, can, be, arrived, at, via, observation, and, induction, thereby, laying, the, foundations, of, the, scientific, method, aristotle, also, produced, many, biological, writings, that, were, empirical, in, nature, focusing, on, biological, causation, and, the, diversity, of, life, he, made, countless, observations, of, nature, especially, the, habits, and, attributes, of, plants, and, animals, on, lesbos, classified, more, than, 540, animal, species, and, dissected, at, least, 50, aristotle, s, writings, profoundly, influenced, subsequent, islamic, and, european, scholarship, though, they, were, eventually, superseded, in, the, scientific, revolution, aristotle, also, contributed, to, theories, of, the, elements, and, the, cosmos, he, believed, that, the, celestial, bodies, such, as, the, planets, and, the, sun, had, something, called, an, unmoved, mover, that, put, the, celestial, bodies, in, motion, aristotle, tried, to, explain, everything, through, mathematics, and, physics, but, sometimes, explained, things, such, as, the, motion, of, celestial, bodies, through, a, higher, power, such, as, god, aristotle, did, not, have, the, technological, advancements, that, would, have, explained, the, motion, of, celestial, bodies, in, addition, aristotle, had, many, views, on, the, elements, he, believed, that, everything, was, derived, of, the, elements, earth, water, air, fire, and, lastly, the, aether, the, aether, was, a, celestial, element, and, therefore, made, up, the, matter, of, the, celestial, bodies, the, elements, of, earth, water, air, and, fire, were, derived, of, a, combination, of, two, of, the, characteristics, of, hot, wet, cold, and, dry, and, all, had, their, inevitable, place, and, motion, the, motion, of, these, elements, begins, with, earth, being, the, closest, to, the, earth, then, water, air, fire, and, finally, aether, in, addition, to, the, makeup, of, all, things, aristotle, came, up, with, theories, as, to, why, things, did, not, return, to, their, natural, motion, he, understood, that, water, sits, above, earth, air, above, water, and, fire, above, air, in, their, natural, state, he, explained, that, although, all, elements, must, return, to, their, natural, state, the, human, body, and, other, living, things, have, a, constraint, on, the, elements, thus, not, allowing, the, elements, making, one, who, they, are, to, return, to, their, natural, state, the, important, legacy, of, this, period, included, substantial, advances, in, factual, knowledge, especially, in, anatomy, zoology, botany, mineralogy, geography, mathematics, and, astronomy, an, awareness, of, the, importance, of, certain, scientific, problems, especially, those, related, to, the, problem, of, change, and, its, causes, and, a, recognition, of, the, methodological, importance, of, applying, mathematics, to, natural, phenomena, and, of, undertaking, empirical, research, in, the, hellenistic, age, scholars, frequently, employed, the, principles, developed, in, earlier, greek, thought, the, application, of, mathematics, and, deliberate, empirical, research, in, their, scientific, investigations, thus, clear, unbroken, lines, of, influence, lead, from, ancient, greek, and, hellenistic, philosophers, to, medieval, muslim, philosophers, and, scientists, to, the, european, renaissance, and, enlightenment, to, the, secular, sciences, of, the, modern, day, neither, reason, nor, inquiry, began, with, the, ancient, greeks, but, the, socratic, method, did, along, with, the, idea, of, forms, give, great, advances, in, geometry, logic, and, the, natural, sciences, according, to, benjamin, farrington, former, professor, of, classics, at, swansea, university, and, again, the, astronomer, aristarchus, of, samos, was, the, first, known, person, to, propose, a, heliocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, while, the, geographer, eratosthenes, accurately, calculated, the, circumference, of, the, earth, hipparchus, c, 190, c, 120, bce, produced, the, first, systematic, star, catalog, the, level, of, achievement, in, hellenistic, astronomy, and, engineering, is, impressively, shown, by, the, antikythera, mechanism, 150, 100, bce, an, analog, computer, for, calculating, the, position, of, planets, technological, artifacts, of, similar, complexity, did, not, reappear, until, the, 14th, century, when, mechanical, astronomical, clocks, appeared, in, europe, there, was, not, a, defined, societal, structure, for, healthcare, during, the, age, of, hippocrates, at, that, time, society, was, not, organized, and, knowledgeable, as, people, still, relied, on, pure, religious, reasoning, to, explain, illnesses, hippocrates, introduced, the, first, healthcare, system, based, on, science, and, clinical, protocols, hippocrates, theories, about, physics, and, medicine, helped, pave, the, way, in, creating, an, organized, medical, structure, for, society, in, medicine, hippocrates, c, 460, bc, c, 370, bce, and, his, followers, were, the, first, to, describe, many, diseases, and, medical, conditions, and, developed, the, hippocratic, oath, for, physicians, still, relevant, and, in, use, today, hippocrates, ideas, are, expressed, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, the, collection, notes, descriptions, of, medical, philosophies, and, how, disease, and, lifestyle, choices, reflect, on, the, physical, body, hippocrates, influenced, a, westernized, professional, relationship, among, physician, and, patient, hippocrates, is, also, known, as, the, father, of, medicine, herophilos, 335, 280, bce, was, the, first, to, base, his, conclusions, on, dissection, of, the, human, body, and, to, describe, the, nervous, system, galen, 129, c, 200, ce, performed, many, audacious, operations, including, brain, and, eye, surgeries, that, were, not, tried, again, for, almost, two, millennia, in, hellenistic, egypt, the, mathematician, euclid, laid, down, the, foundations, of, mathematical, rigor, and, introduced, the, concepts, of, definition, axiom, theorem, and, proof, still, in, use, today, in, his, elements, considered, the, most, influential, textbook, ever, written, archimedes, considered, one, of, the, greatest, mathematicians, of, all, time, is, credited, with, using, the, method, of, exhaustion, to, calculate, the, area, under, the, arc, of, a, parabola, with, the, summation, of, an, infinite, series, and, gave, a, remarkably, accurate, approximation, of, pi, he, is, also, known, in, physics, for, laying, the, foundations, of, hydrostatics, statics, and, the, explanation, of, the, principle, of, the, lever, theophrastus, wrote, some, of, the, earliest, descriptions, of, plants, and, animals, establishing, the, first, taxonomy, and, looking, at, minerals, in, terms, of, their, properties, such, as, hardness, pliny, the, elder, produced, one, of, the, largest, encyclopedias, of, the, natural, world, in, 77, ce, and, was, a, successor, to, theophrastus, for, example, he, accurately, describes, the, octahedral, shape, of, the, diamond, and, noted, that, diamond, dust, is, used, by, engravers, to, cut, and, polish, other, gems, owing, to, its, great, hardness, his, recognition, of, the, importance, of, crystal, shape, is, a, precursor, to, modern, crystallography, while, notes, on, other, minerals, presages, mineralogy, he, recognizes, other, minerals, have, characteristic, crystal, shapes, but, in, one, example, confuses, the, crystal, habit, with, the, work, of, lapidaries, pliny, was, the, first, to, show, amber, was, a, resin, from, pine, trees, because, of, trapped, insects, within, them, the, development, of, archaeology, has, its, roots, in, history, and, with, those, who, were, interested, in, the, past, such, as, kings, and, queens, who, wanted, to, show, past, glories, of, their, respective, nations, the, 5th, century, bce, greek, historian, herodotus, was, the, first, scholar, to, systematically, study, the, past, and, perhaps, the, first, to, examine, artifacts, during, the, rule, of, rome, famous, historians, such, as, polybius, livy, and, plutarch, documented, the, rise, of, the, roman, republic, and, the, organization, and, histories, of, other, nations, while, statesmen, like, julius, caesar, cicero, and, others, provided, examples, of, the, politics, of, the, republic, and, rome, s, empire, and, wars, the, study, of, politics, during, this, age, was, oriented, toward, understanding, history, understanding, methods, of, governing, and, describing, the, operation, of, governments, the, roman, conquest, of, greece, did, not, diminish, learning, and, culture, in, the, greek, provinces, on, the, contrary, the, appreciation, of, greek, achievements, in, literature, philosophy, politics, and, the, arts, by, rome, s, upper, class, coincided, with, the, increased, prosperity, of, the, roman, empire, greek, settlements, had, existed, in, italy, for, centuries, and, the, ability, to, read, and, speak, greek, was, not, uncommon, in, italian, cities, such, as, rome, moreover, the, settlement, of, greek, scholars, in, rome, whether, voluntarily, or, as, slaves, gave, romans, access, to, teachers, of, greek, literature, and, philosophy, conversely, young, roman, scholars, also, studied, abroad, in, greece, and, upon, their, return, to, rome, were, able, to, convey, greek, achievements, to, their, latin, leadership, and, despite, the, translation, of, a, few, greek, texts, into, latin, roman, scholars, who, aspired, to, the, highest, level, did, so, using, the, greek, language, the, roman, statesman, and, philosopher, cicero, 106, 43, bce, was, a, prime, example, he, had, studied, under, greek, teachers, in, rome, and, then, in, athens, and, rhodes, he, mastered, considerable, portions, of, greek, philosophy, wrote, latin, treatises, on, several, topics, and, even, wrote, greek, commentaries, of, plato, s, timaeus, as, well, as, a, latin, translation, of, it, which, has, not, survived, in, the, beginning, support, for, scholarship, in, greek, knowledge, was, almost, entirely, funded, by, the, roman, upper, class, there, were, all, sorts, of, arrangements, ranging, from, a, talented, scholar, being, attached, to, a, wealthy, household, to, owning, educated, greek, speaking, slaves, in, exchange, scholars, who, succeeded, at, the, highest, level, had, an, obligation, to, provide, advice, or, intellectual, companionship, to, their, roman, benefactors, or, to, even, take, care, of, their, libraries, the, less, fortunate, or, accomplished, ones, would, teach, their, children, or, perform, menial, tasks, the, level, of, detail, and, sophistication, of, greek, knowledge, was, adjusted, to, suit, the, interests, of, their, roman, patrons, that, meant, popularizing, greek, knowledge, by, presenting, information, that, were, of, practical, value, such, as, medicine, or, logic, for, courts, and, politics, but, excluding, subtle, details, of, greek, metaphysics, and, epistemology, beyond, the, basics, the, romans, did, not, value, natural, philosophy, and, considered, it, an, amusement, for, leisure, time, commentaries, and, encyclopedias, were, the, means, by, which, greek, knowledge, was, popularized, for, roman, audiences, the, greek, scholar, posidonius, c, 135, c, 51, bce, a, native, of, syria, wrote, prolifically, on, history, geography, moral, philosophy, and, natural, philosophy, he, greatly, influenced, latin, writers, such, as, marcus, terentius, varro, 116, 27, bce, who, wrote, the, encyclopedia, nine, books, of, disciplines, which, covered, nine, arts, grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, musical, theory, medicine, and, architecture, the, disciplines, became, a, model, for, subsequent, roman, encyclopedias, and, varro, s, nine, liberal, arts, were, considered, suitable, education, for, a, roman, gentleman, the, first, seven, of, varro, s, nine, arts, would, later, define, the, seven, liberal, arts, of, medieval, schools, the, pinnacle, of, the, popularization, movement, was, the, roman, scholar, pliny, the, elder, 23, 24, 79, ce, a, native, of, northern, italy, who, wrote, several, books, on, the, history, of, rome, and, grammar, his, most, famous, work, was, his, voluminous, natural, history, after, the, death, of, the, roman, emperor, marcus, aurelius, in, 180, ce, the, favorable, conditions, for, scholarship, and, learning, in, the, roman, empire, were, upended, by, political, unrest, civil, war, urban, decay, and, looming, economic, crisis, in, around, 250, ce, barbarians, began, attacking, and, invading, the, roman, frontiers, these, combined, events, led, to, a, general, decline, in, political, and, economic, conditions, the, living, standards, of, the, roman, upper, class, was, severely, impacted, and, their, loss, of, leisure, diminished, scholarly, pursuits, moreover, during, the, 3rd, and, 4th, centuries, ce, the, roman, empire, was, administratively, divided, into, two, halves, greek, east, and, latin, west, these, administrative, divisions, weakened, the, intellectual, contact, between, the, two, regions, eventually, both, halves, went, their, separate, ways, with, the, greek, east, becoming, the, byzantine, empire, christianity, was, also, steadily, expanding, during, this, time, and, soon, became, a, major, patron, of, education, in, the, latin, west, initially, the, christian, church, adopted, some, of, the, reasoning, tools, of, greek, philosophy, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, ce, to, defend, its, faith, against, sophisticated, opponents, nevertheless, greek, philosophy, received, a, mixed, reception, from, leaders, and, adherents, of, the, christian, faith, some, such, as, tertullian, c, 155, c, 230, ce, were, vehemently, opposed, to, philosophy, denouncing, it, as, heretic, others, such, as, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, ce, were, ambivalent, and, defended, greek, philosophy, and, science, as, the, best, ways, to, understand, the, natural, world, and, therefore, treated, it, as, a, handmaiden, or, servant, of, religion, education, in, the, west, began, its, gradual, decline, along, with, the, rest, of, western, roman, empire, due, to, invasions, by, germanic, tribes, civil, unrest, and, economic, collapse, contact, with, the, classical, tradition, was, lost, in, specific, regions, such, as, roman, britain, and, northern, gaul, but, continued, to, exist, in, rome, northern, italy, southern, gaul, spain, and, north, africa, in, the, middle, ages, the, classical, learning, continued, in, three, major, linguistic, cultures, and, civilizations, greek, the, byzantine, empire, arabic, the, islamic, world, and, latin, western, europe, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, led, to, a, deterioration, of, the, classical, tradition, in, the, western, part, or, latin, west, of, europe, during, the, 5th, century, in, contrast, the, byzantine, empire, resisted, the, barbarian, attacks, and, preserved, and, improved, the, learning, while, the, byzantine, empire, still, held, learning, centers, such, as, constantinople, alexandria, and, antioch, western, europe, s, knowledge, was, concentrated, in, monasteries, until, the, development, of, medieval, universities, in, the, 12th, centuries, the, curriculum, of, monastic, schools, included, the, study, of, the, few, available, ancient, texts, and, of, new, works, on, practical, subjects, like, medicine, and, timekeeping, in, the, sixth, century, in, the, byzantine, empire, isidore, of, miletus, compiled, archimedes, mathematical, works, in, the, archimedes, palimpsest, where, all, archimedes, mathematical, contributions, were, collected, and, studied, john, philoponus, another, byzantine, scholar, was, the, first, to, question, aristotle, s, teaching, of, physics, introducing, the, theory, of, impetus, the, theory, of, impetus, was, an, auxiliary, or, secondary, theory, of, aristotelian, dynamics, put, forth, initially, to, explain, projectile, motion, against, gravity, it, is, the, intellectual, precursor, to, the, concepts, of, inertia, momentum, and, acceleration, in, classical, mechanics, the, works, of, john, philoponus, inspired, galileo, galilei, ten, centuries, later, during, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, a, number, of, greek, scholars, fled, to, north, italy, in, which, they, fueled, the, era, later, commonly, known, as, the, renaissance, as, they, brought, with, them, a, great, deal, of, classical, learning, including, an, understanding, of, botany, medicine, and, zoology, byzantium, also, gave, the, west, important, inputs, john, philoponus, criticism, of, aristotelian, physics, and, the, works, of, dioscorides, this, was, the, period, 8th, 14th, century, ce, of, the, islamic, golden, age, where, commerce, thrived, and, new, ideas, and, technologies, emerged, such, as, the, importation, of, papermaking, from, china, which, made, the, copying, of, manuscripts, inexpensive, the, eastward, transmission, of, greek, heritage, to, western, asia, was, a, slow, and, gradual, process, that, spanned, over, a, thousand, years, beginning, with, the, asian, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, in, 335, bce, to, the, founding, of, islam, in, the, 7th, century, ce, the, birth, and, expansion, of, islam, during, the, 7th, century, was, quickly, followed, by, its, hellenization, knowledge, of, greek, conceptions, of, the, world, was, preserved, and, absorbed, into, islamic, theology, law, culture, and, commerce, which, were, aided, by, the, translations, of, traditional, greek, texts, and, some, syriac, intermediary, sources, into, arabic, during, the, 8th, 9th, century, madrasas, were, centers, for, many, different, religious, and, scientific, studies, and, were, the, culmination, of, different, institutions, such, as, mosques, based, around, religious, studies, housing, for, out, of, town, visitors, and, finally, educational, institutions, focused, on, the, natural, sciences, unlike, western, universities, students, at, a, madrasa, would, learn, from, one, specific, teacher, who, would, issue, a, certificate, at, the, completion, of, their, studies, called, an, ijazah, an, ijazah, differs, from, a, western, university, degree, in, many, ways, one, being, that, it, is, issued, by, a, single, person, rather, than, an, institution, and, another, being, that, it, is, not, an, individual, degree, declaring, adequate, knowledge, over, broad, subjects, but, rather, a, license, to, teach, and, pass, on, a, very, specific, set, of, texts, women, were, also, allowed, to, attend, madrasas, as, both, students, and, teachers, something, not, seen, in, high, western, education, until, the, 1800s, madrasas, were, more, than, just, academic, centers, the, suleymaniye, mosque, for, example, was, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, well, known, madrasas, which, was, built, by, suleiman, the, magnificent, in, the, 16th, century, the, suleymaniye, mosque, was, home, to, a, hospital, and, medical, college, a, kitchen, and, children, s, school, as, well, as, serving, as, a, temporary, home, for, travelers, higher, education, at, a, madrasa, or, college, was, focused, on, islamic, law, and, religious, science, and, students, had, to, engage, in, self, study, for, everything, else, and, despite, the, occasional, theological, backlash, many, islamic, scholars, of, science, were, able, to, conduct, their, work, in, relatively, tolerant, urban, centers, e, g, baghdad, and, cairo, and, were, protected, by, powerful, patrons, they, could, also, travel, freely, and, exchange, ideas, as, there, were, no, political, barriers, within, the, unified, islamic, state, islamic, science, during, this, time, was, primarily, focused, on, the, correction, extension, articulation, and, application, of, greek, ideas, to, new, problems, most, of, the, achievements, by, islamic, scholars, during, this, period, were, in, mathematics, arabic, mathematics, was, a, direct, descendant, of, greek, and, indian, mathematics, for, instance, what, is, now, known, as, arabic, numerals, originally, came, from, india, but, muslim, mathematicians, made, several, key, refinements, to, the, number, system, such, as, the, introduction, of, decimal, point, notation, mathematicians, such, as, muhammad, ibn, musa, al, khwarizmi, c, 780, 850, gave, his, name, to, the, concept, of, the, algorithm, while, the, term, algebra, is, derived, from, al, jabr, the, beginning, of, the, title, of, one, of, his, publications, islamic, trigonometry, continued, from, the, works, of, ptolemy, s, almagest, and, indian, siddhanta, from, which, they, added, trigonometric, functions, drew, up, tables, and, applied, trignometry, to, spheres, and, planes, many, of, their, engineers, instruments, makers, and, surveyors, contributed, books, in, applied, mathematics, it, was, in, astronomy, where, islamic, mathematicians, made, their, greatest, contributions, al, battani, c, 858, 929, improved, the, measurements, of, hipparchus, preserved, in, the, translation, of, ptolemy, s, h, megal, syntaxis, the, great, treatise, translated, as, almagest, al, battani, also, improved, the, precision, of, the, measurement, of, the, precession, of, the, earth, s, axis, corrections, were, made, to, ptolemy, s, geocentric, model, by, al, battani, ibn, al, haytham, averroes, and, the, maragha, astronomers, such, as, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, mu, ayyad, al, din, al, urdi, and, ibn, al, shatir, scholars, with, geometric, skills, made, significant, improvements, to, the, earlier, classical, texts, on, light, and, sight, by, euclid, aristotle, and, ptolemy, the, earliest, surviving, arabic, treatises, were, written, in, the, 9th, century, by, ab, ish, q, al, kind, qust, ibn, l, q, and, in, fragmentary, form, ahmad, ibn, is, later, in, the, 11th, century, ibn, al, haytham, known, as, alhazen, in, the, west, a, mathematician, and, astronomer, synthesized, a, new, theory, of, vision, based, on, the, works, of, his, predecessors, his, new, theory, included, a, complete, system, of, geometrical, optics, which, was, set, in, great, detail, in, his, book, of, optics, his, book, was, translated, into, latin, and, was, relied, upon, as, a, principal, source, on, the, science, of, optics, in, europe, until, the, 17th, century, the, medical, sciences, were, prominently, cultivated, in, the, islamic, world, the, works, of, greek, medical, theories, especially, those, of, galen, were, translated, into, arabic, and, there, was, an, outpouring, of, medical, texts, by, islamic, physicians, which, were, aimed, at, organizing, elaborating, and, disseminating, classical, medical, knowledge, medical, specialties, started, to, emerge, such, as, those, involved, in, the, treatment, of, eye, diseases, such, as, cataracts, ibn, sina, known, as, avicenna, in, the, west, c, 980, 1037, was, a, prolific, persian, medical, encyclopedist, wrote, extensively, on, medicine, with, his, two, most, notable, works, in, medicine, being, the, kit, b, al, shif, book, of, healing, and, the, canon, of, medicine, both, of, which, were, used, as, standard, medicinal, texts, in, both, the, muslim, world, and, in, europe, well, into, the, 17th, century, amongst, his, many, contributions, are, the, discovery, of, the, contagious, nature, of, infectious, diseases, and, the, introduction, of, clinical, pharmacology, institutionalization, of, medicine, was, another, important, achievement, in, the, islamic, world, although, hospitals, as, an, institution, for, the, sick, emerged, in, the, byzantium, empire, the, model, of, institutionalized, medicine, for, all, social, classes, was, extensive, in, the, islamic, empire, and, was, scattered, throughout, in, addition, to, treating, patients, physicians, could, teach, apprentice, physicians, as, well, write, and, do, research, the, discovery, of, the, pulmonary, transit, of, blood, in, the, human, body, by, ibn, al, nafis, occurred, in, a, hospital, setting, islamic, science, began, its, decline, in, the, 12th, 13th, century, before, the, renaissance, in, europe, due, in, part, to, the, christian, reconquest, of, spain, and, the, mongol, conquests, in, the, east, in, the, 11th, 13th, century, the, mongols, sacked, baghdad, capital, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, 1258, which, ended, the, abbasid, empire, nevertheless, many, of, the, conquerors, became, patrons, of, the, sciences, hulagu, khan, for, example, who, led, the, siege, of, baghdad, became, a, patron, of, the, maragheh, observatory, islamic, astronomy, continued, to, flourish, into, the, 16th, century, by, the, eleventh, century, most, of, europe, had, become, christian, stronger, monarchies, emerged, borders, were, restored, technological, developments, and, agricultural, innovations, were, made, increasing, the, food, supply, and, population, classical, greek, texts, were, translated, from, arabic, and, greek, into, latin, stimulating, scientific, discussion, in, western, europe, in, classical, antiquity, greek, and, roman, taboos, had, meant, that, dissection, was, usually, banned, but, in, the, middle, ages, medical, teachers, and, students, at, bologna, began, to, open, human, bodies, and, mondino, de, luzzi, c, 1275, 1326, produced, the, first, known, anatomy, textbook, based, on, human, dissection, as, a, result, of, the, pax, mongolica, europeans, such, as, marco, polo, began, to, venture, further, and, further, east, the, written, accounts, of, polo, and, his, fellow, travelers, inspired, other, western, european, maritime, explorers, to, search, for, a, direct, sea, route, to, asia, ultimately, leading, to, the, age, of, discovery, technological, advances, were, also, made, such, as, the, early, flight, of, eilmer, of, malmesbury, who, had, studied, mathematics, in, 11th, century, england, and, the, metallurgical, achievements, of, the, cistercian, blast, furnace, at, laskill, an, intellectual, revitalization, of, western, europe, started, with, the, birth, of, medieval, universities, in, the, 12th, century, these, urban, institutions, grew, from, the, informal, scholarly, activities, of, learned, friars, who, visited, monasteries, consulted, libraries, and, conversed, with, other, fellow, scholars, a, friar, who, became, well, known, would, attract, a, following, of, disciples, giving, rise, to, a, brotherhood, of, scholars, or, collegium, in, latin, a, collegium, might, travel, to, a, town, or, request, a, monastery, to, host, them, however, if, the, number, of, scholars, within, a, collegium, grew, too, large, they, would, opt, to, settle, in, a, town, instead, as, the, number, of, collegia, within, a, town, grew, the, collegia, might, request, that, their, king, grant, them, a, charter, that, would, convert, them, into, a, universitas, many, universities, were, chartered, during, this, period, with, the, first, in, bologna, in, 1088, followed, by, paris, in, 1150, oxford, in, 1167, and, cambridge, in, 1231, the, granting, of, a, charter, meant, that, the, medieval, universities, were, partially, sovereign, and, independent, from, local, authorities, their, independence, allowed, them, to, conduct, themselves, and, judge, their, own, members, based, on, their, own, rules, furthermore, as, initially, religious, institutions, their, faculties, and, students, were, protected, from, capital, punishment, e, g, gallows, such, independence, was, a, matter, of, custom, which, could, in, principle, be, revoked, by, their, respective, rulers, if, they, felt, threatened, discussions, of, various, subjects, or, claims, at, these, medieval, institutions, no, matter, how, controversial, were, done, in, a, formalized, way, so, as, to, declare, such, discussions, as, being, within, the, bounds, of, a, university, and, therefore, protected, by, the, privileges, of, that, institution, s, sovereignty, a, claim, could, be, described, as, ex, cathedra, literally, from, the, chair, used, within, the, context, of, teaching, or, ex, hypothesi, by, hypothesis, this, meant, that, the, discussions, were, presented, as, purely, an, intellectual, exercise, that, did, not, require, those, involved, to, commit, themselves, to, the, truth, of, a, claim, or, to, proselytize, modern, academic, concepts, and, practices, such, as, academic, freedom, or, freedom, of, inquiry, are, remnants, of, these, medieval, privileges, that, were, tolerated, in, the, past, the, curriculum, of, these, medieval, institutions, centered, on, the, seven, liberal, arts, which, were, aimed, at, providing, beginning, students, with, the, skills, for, reasoning, and, scholarly, language, students, would, begin, their, studies, starting, with, the, first, three, liberal, arts, or, trivium, grammar, rhetoric, and, logic, followed, by, the, next, four, liberal, arts, or, quadrivium, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and, music, those, who, completed, these, requirements, and, received, their, baccalaureate, or, bachelor, of, arts, had, the, option, to, join, the, higher, faculty, law, medicine, or, theology, which, would, confer, an, lld, for, a, lawyer, an, md, for, a, physician, or, thd, for, a, theologian, students, who, chose, to, remain, in, the, lower, faculty, arts, could, work, towards, a, magister, or, master, s, degree, and, would, study, three, philosophies, metaphysics, ethics, and, natural, philosophy, latin, translations, of, aristotle, s, works, such, as, de, anima, on, the, soul, and, the, commentaries, on, them, were, required, readings, as, time, passed, the, lower, faculty, was, allowed, to, confer, its, own, doctoral, degree, called, the, phd, many, of, the, masters, were, drawn, to, encyclopedias, and, had, used, them, as, textbooks, but, these, scholars, yearned, for, the, complete, original, texts, of, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, mathematicians, and, physicians, such, as, aristotle, euclid, and, galen, which, were, not, available, to, them, at, the, time, these, ancient, greek, texts, were, to, be, found, in, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, islamic, world, contact, with, the, byzantine, empire, and, with, the, islamic, world, during, the, reconquista, and, the, crusades, allowed, latin, europe, access, to, scientific, greek, and, arabic, texts, including, the, works, of, aristotle, ptolemy, isidore, of, miletus, john, philoponus, j, bir, ibn, hayy, n, al, khwarizmi, alhazen, avicenna, and, averroes, european, scholars, had, access, to, the, translation, programs, of, raymond, of, toledo, who, sponsored, the, 12th, century, toledo, school, of, translators, from, arabic, to, latin, later, translators, like, michael, scotus, would, learn, arabic, in, order, to, study, these, texts, directly, the, european, universities, aided, materially, in, the, translation, and, propagation, of, these, texts, and, started, a, new, infrastructure, which, was, needed, for, scientific, communities, in, fact, european, university, put, many, works, about, the, natural, world, and, the, study, of, nature, at, the, center, of, its, curriculum, with, the, result, that, the, medieval, university, laid, far, greater, emphasis, on, science, than, does, its, modern, counterpart, and, descendent, at, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, there, were, reasonably, accurate, latin, translations, of, the, main, works, of, almost, all, the, intellectually, crucial, ancient, authors, allowing, a, sound, transfer, of, scientific, ideas, via, both, the, universities, and, the, monasteries, by, then, the, natural, philosophy, in, these, texts, began, to, be, extended, by, scholastics, such, as, robert, grosseteste, roger, bacon, albertus, magnus, and, duns, scotus, precursors, of, the, modern, scientific, method, influenced, by, earlier, contributions, of, the, islamic, world, can, be, seen, already, in, grosseteste, s, emphasis, on, mathematics, as, a, way, to, understand, nature, and, in, the, empirical, approach, admired, by, bacon, particularly, in, his, opus, majus, pierre, duhem, s, thesis, is, that, stephen, tempier, the, bishop, of, paris, condemnation, of, 1277, led, to, the, study, of, medieval, science, as, a, serious, discipline, but, no, one, in, the, field, any, longer, endorses, his, view, that, modern, science, started, in, 1277, however, many, scholars, agree, with, duhem, s, view, that, the, mid, late, middle, ages, saw, important, scientific, developments, the, first, half, of, the, 14th, century, saw, much, important, scientific, work, largely, within, the, framework, of, scholastic, commentaries, on, aristotle, s, scientific, writings, william, of, ockham, emphasized, the, principle, of, parsimony, natural, philosophers, should, not, postulate, unnecessary, entities, so, that, motion, is, not, a, distinct, thing, but, is, only, the, moving, object, and, an, intermediary, sensible, species, is, not, needed, to, transmit, an, image, of, an, object, to, the, eye, scholars, such, as, jean, buridan, and, nicole, oresme, started, to, reinterpret, elements, of, aristotle, s, mechanics, in, particular, buridan, developed, the, theory, that, impetus, was, the, cause, of, the, motion, of, projectiles, which, was, a, first, step, towards, the, modern, concept, of, inertia, the, oxford, calculators, began, to, mathematically, analyze, the, kinematics, of, motion, making, this, analysis, without, considering, the, causes, of, motion, in, 1348, the, black, death, and, other, disasters, sealed, a, sudden, end, to, philosophic, and, scientific, development, yet, the, rediscovery, of, ancient, texts, was, stimulated, by, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, when, many, byzantine, scholars, sought, refuge, in, the, west, meanwhile, the, introduction, of, printing, was, to, have, great, effect, on, european, society, the, facilitated, dissemination, of, the, printed, word, democratized, learning, and, allowed, ideas, such, as, algebra, to, propagate, more, rapidly, these, developments, paved, the, way, for, the, scientific, revolution, where, scientific, inquiry, halted, at, the, start, of, the, black, death, resumed, the, renewal, of, learning, in, europe, began, with, 12th, century, scholasticism, the, northern, renaissance, showed, a, decisive, shift, in, focus, from, aristotelian, natural, philosophy, to, chemistry, and, the, biological, sciences, botany, anatomy, and, medicine, thus, modern, science, in, europe, was, resumed, in, a, period, of, great, upheaval, the, protestant, reformation, and, catholic, counter, reformation, the, discovery, of, the, americas, by, christopher, columbus, the, fall, of, constantinople, but, also, the, re, discovery, of, aristotle, during, the, scholastic, period, presaged, large, social, and, political, changes, thus, a, suitable, environment, was, created, in, which, it, became, possible, to, question, scientific, doctrine, in, much, the, same, way, that, martin, luther, and, john, calvin, questioned, religious, doctrine, the, works, of, ptolemy, astronomy, and, galen, medicine, were, found, not, always, to, match, everyday, observations, work, by, vesalius, on, human, cadavers, found, problems, with, the, galenic, view, of, anatomy, the, discovery, of, cristallo, contributed, to, the, advancement, of, science, in, the, period, as, well, with, its, appearance, out, of, venice, around, 1450, the, new, glass, allowed, for, better, spectacles, and, eventually, to, the, inventions, of, the, telescope, and, microscope, theophrastus, work, on, rocks, peri, lith, n, remained, authoritative, for, millennia, its, interpretation, of, fossils, was, not, overturned, until, after, the, scientific, revolution, during, the, italian, renaissance, niccol, machiavelli, established, the, emphasis, of, modern, political, science, on, direct, empirical, observation, of, political, institutions, and, actors, later, the, expansion, of, the, scientific, paradigm, during, the, enlightenment, further, pushed, the, study, of, politics, beyond, normative, determinations, in, particular, the, study, of, statistics, to, study, the, subjects, of, the, state, has, been, applied, to, polling, and, voting, in, archaeology, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, saw, the, rise, of, antiquarians, in, renaissance, europe, who, were, interested, in, the, collection, of, artifacts, the, early, modern, period, is, seen, as, a, flowering, of, the, european, renaissance, there, was, a, willingness, to, question, previously, held, truths, and, search, for, new, answers, this, resulted, in, a, period, of, major, scientific, advancements, now, known, as, the, scientific, revolution, which, led, to, the, emergence, of, a, new, science, that, was, more, mechanistic, in, its, worldview, more, integrated, with, mathematics, and, more, reliable, and, open, as, its, knowledge, was, based, on, a, newly, defined, scientific, method, the, scientific, revolution, is, a, convenient, boundary, between, ancient, thought, and, classical, physics, and, is, traditionally, held, to, have, begun, in, 1543, when, the, books, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, on, the, workings, of, the, human, body, by, andreas, vesalius, and, also, de, revolutionibus, by, the, astronomer, nicolaus, copernicus, were, first, printed, the, period, culminated, with, the, publication, of, the, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, in, 1687, by, isaac, newton, representative, of, the, unprecedented, growth, of, scientific, publications, throughout, europe, other, significant, scientific, advances, were, made, during, this, time, by, galileo, galilei, johannes, kepler, edmond, halley, william, harvey, pierre, fermat, robert, hooke, christiaan, huygens, tycho, brahe, marin, mersenne, gottfried, leibniz, isaac, newton, and, blaise, pascal, in, philosophy, major, contributions, were, made, by, francis, bacon, sir, thomas, browne, ren, descartes, baruch, spinoza, pierre, gassendi, robert, boyle, and, thomas, hobbes, christiaan, huygens, derived, the, centripetal, and, centrifugal, forces, and, was, the, first, to, transfer, mathematical, inquiry, to, describe, unobservable, physical, phenomena, william, gilbert, did, some, of, the, earliest, experiments, with, electricity, and, magnetism, establishing, that, the, earth, itself, is, magnetic, the, heliocentric, astronomical, model, of, the, universe, was, refined, by, nicolaus, copernicus, copernicus, proposed, the, idea, that, the, earth, and, all, heavenly, spheres, containing, the, planets, and, other, objects, in, the, cosmos, rotated, around, the, sun, his, heliocentric, model, also, proposed, that, all, stars, were, fixed, and, did, not, rotate, on, an, axis, nor, in, any, motion, at, all, his, theory, proposed, the, yearly, rotation, of, the, earth, and, the, other, heavenly, spheres, around, the, sun, and, was, able, to, calculate, the, distances, of, planets, using, deferents, and, epicycles, although, these, calculations, were, not, completely, accurate, copernicus, was, able, to, understand, the, distance, order, of, each, heavenly, sphere, the, copernican, heliocentric, system, was, a, revival, of, the, hypotheses, of, aristarchus, of, samos, and, seleucus, of, seleucia, aristarchus, of, samos, did, propose, that, the, earth, rotated, around, the, sun, but, did, not, mention, anything, about, the, other, heavenly, spheres, order, motion, or, rotation, seleucus, of, seleucia, also, proposed, the, rotation, of, the, earth, around, the, sun, but, did, not, mention, anything, about, the, other, heavenly, spheres, in, addition, seleucus, of, seleucia, understood, that, the, moon, rotated, around, the, earth, and, could, be, used, to, explain, the, tides, of, the, oceans, thus, further, proving, his, understanding, of, the, heliocentric, idea, the, scientific, revolution, continued, into, the, age, of, enlightenment, which, accelerated, the, development, of, modern, science, the, heliocentric, model, revived, by, nicolaus, copernicus, was, followed, by, the, model, of, planetary, motion, given, by, johannes, kepler, in, the, early, 17th, century, which, proposed, that, the, planets, follow, elliptical, orbits, with, the, sun, at, one, focus, of, the, ellipse, in, astronomia, nova, a, new, astronomy, the, first, two, of, the, laws, of, planetary, motion, were, shown, by, the, analysis, of, the, orbit, of, mars, kepler, introduced, the, revolutionary, concept, of, planetary, orbit, because, of, his, work, astronomical, phenomena, came, to, be, seen, as, being, governed, by, physical, laws, a, decisive, moment, came, when, chemistry, was, distinguished, from, alchemy, by, robert, boyle, in, his, work, the, sceptical, chymist, in, 1661, although, the, alchemical, tradition, continued, for, some, time, after, his, work, other, important, steps, included, the, gravimetric, experimental, practices, of, medical, chemists, like, william, cullen, joseph, black, torbern, bergman, and, pierre, macquer, and, through, the, work, of, antoine, lavoisier, father, of, modern, chemistry, on, oxygen, and, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, which, refuted, phlogiston, theory, modern, chemistry, emerged, from, the, sixteenth, through, the, eighteenth, centuries, through, the, material, practices, and, theories, promoted, by, alchemy, medicine, manufacturing, and, mining, in, 1687, isaac, newton, published, the, principia, mathematica, detailing, two, comprehensive, and, successful, physical, theories, newton, s, laws, of, motion, which, led, to, classical, mechanics, and, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, which, describes, the, fundamental, force, of, gravity, william, harvey, published, de, motu, cordis, in, 1628, which, revealed, his, conclusions, based, on, his, extensive, studies, of, vertebrate, circulatory, systems, he, identified, the, central, role, of, the, heart, arteries, and, veins, in, producing, blood, movement, in, a, circuit, and, failed, to, find, any, confirmation, of, galen, s, pre, existing, notions, of, heating, and, cooling, functions, the, history, of, early, modern, biology, and, medicine, is, often, told, through, the, search, for, the, seat, of, the, soul, galen, in, his, descriptions, of, his, foundational, work, in, medicine, presents, the, distinctions, between, arteries, veins, and, nerves, using, the, vocabulary, of, the, soul, a, critical, innovation, was, the, creation, of, permanent, scientific, societies, and, their, scholarly, journals, which, dramatically, sped, the, diffusion, of, new, ideas, typical, was, the, founding, of, the, royal, society, in, london, in, 1660, and, its, journal, in, 1665, the, philosophical, transaction, of, the, royal, society, the, first, scientific, journal, in, english, 1665, also, saw, the, first, journal, in, french, the, journal, des, s, avans, science, drawing, on, the, works, of, newton, descartes, pascal, and, leibniz, science, was, on, a, path, to, modern, mathematics, physics, and, technology, by, the, time, of, the, generation, of, benjamin, franklin, 1706, 1790, leonhard, euler, 1707, 1783, mikhail, lomonosov, 1711, 1765, and, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, 1717, 1783, denis, diderot, s, encyclop, die, published, between, 1751, and, 1772, brought, this, new, understanding, to, a, wider, audience, the, impact, of, this, process, was, not, limited, to, science, and, technology, but, affected, philosophy, immanuel, kant, david, hume, religion, the, increasingly, significant, impact, of, science, upon, religion, and, society, and, politics, in, general, adam, smith, voltaire, geology, did, not, undergo, systematic, restructuring, during, the, scientific, revolution, but, instead, existed, as, a, cloud, of, isolated, disconnected, ideas, about, rocks, minerals, and, landforms, long, before, it, became, a, coherent, science, robert, hooke, formulated, a, theory, of, earthquakes, and, nicholas, steno, developed, the, theory, of, superposition, and, argued, that, fossils, were, the, remains, of, once, living, creatures, beginning, with, thomas, burnet, s, sacred, theory, of, the, earth, in, 1681, natural, philosophers, began, to, explore, the, idea, that, the, earth, had, changed, over, time, burnet, and, his, contemporaries, interpreted, earth, s, past, in, terms, of, events, described, in, the, bible, but, their, work, laid, the, intellectual, foundations, for, secular, interpretations, of, earth, history, during, the, late, 18th, century, researchers, such, as, hugh, williamson, and, john, walsh, experimented, on, the, effects, of, electricity, on, the, human, body, further, studies, by, luigi, galvani, and, alessandro, volta, established, the, electrical, nature, of, what, volta, called, galvanism, modern, geology, like, modern, chemistry, gradually, evolved, during, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, beno, t, de, maillet, and, the, comte, de, buffon, saw, the, earth, as, much, older, than, the, 6, 000, years, envisioned, by, biblical, scholars, jean, tienne, guettard, and, nicolas, desmarest, hiked, central, france, and, recorded, their, observations, on, some, of, the, first, geological, maps, aided, by, chemical, experimentation, naturalists, such, as, scotland, s, john, walker, sweden, s, torbern, bergman, and, germany, s, abraham, werner, created, comprehensive, classification, systems, for, rocks, and, minerals, a, collective, achievement, that, transformed, geology, into, a, cutting, edge, field, by, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, these, early, geologists, also, proposed, a, generalized, interpretations, of, earth, history, that, led, james, hutton, georges, cuvier, and, alexandre, brongniart, following, in, the, steps, of, steno, to, argue, that, layers, of, rock, could, be, dated, by, the, fossils, they, contained, a, principle, first, applied, to, the, geology, of, the, paris, basin, the, use, of, index, fossils, became, a, powerful, tool, for, making, geological, maps, because, it, allowed, geologists, to, correlate, the, rocks, in, one, locality, with, those, of, similar, age, in, other, distant, localities, the, basis, for, classical, economics, forms, adam, smith, s, an, inquiry, into, the, nature, and, causes, of, the, wealth, of, nations, published, in, 1776, smith, criticized, mercantilism, advocating, a, system, of, free, trade, with, division, of, labour, he, postulated, an, invisible, hand, that, regulated, economic, systems, made, up, of, actors, guided, only, by, self, interest, the, invisible, hand, mentioned, in, a, lost, page, in, the, middle, of, a, chapter, in, the, middle, of, the, wealth, of, nations, 1776, advances, as, smith, s, central, message, anthropology, can, best, be, understood, as, an, outgrowth, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, it, was, during, this, period, that, europeans, attempted, systematically, to, study, human, behavior, traditions, of, jurisprudence, history, philology, and, sociology, developed, during, this, time, and, informed, the, development, of, the, social, sciences, of, which, anthropology, was, a, part, the, 19th, century, saw, the, birth, of, science, as, a, profession, william, whewell, had, coined, the, term, scientist, in, 1833, which, soon, replaced, the, older, term, natural, philosopher, in, physics, the, behavior, of, electricity, and, magnetism, was, studied, by, giovanni, aldini, alessandro, volta, michael, faraday, georg, ohm, and, others, the, experiments, theories, and, discoveries, of, michael, faraday, andre, marie, ampere, james, clerk, maxwell, and, their, contemporaries, led, to, the, unification, of, the, two, phenomena, into, a, single, theory, of, electromagnetism, as, described, by, maxwell, s, equations, thermodynamics, led, to, an, understanding, of, heat, and, the, notion, of, energy, being, defined, in, astronomy, the, planet, neptune, was, discovered, advances, in, astronomy, and, in, optical, systems, in, the, 19th, century, resulted, in, the, first, observation, of, an, asteroid, 1, ceres, in, 1801, and, the, discovery, of, neptune, in, 1846, in, mathematics, the, notion, of, complex, numbers, finally, matured, and, led, to, a, subsequent, analytical, theory, they, also, began, the, use, of, hypercomplex, numbers, karl, weierstrass, and, others, carried, out, the, arithmetization, of, analysis, for, functions, of, real, and, complex, variables, it, also, saw, rise, to, new, progress, in, geometry, beyond, those, classical, theories, of, euclid, after, a, period, of, nearly, two, thousand, years, the, mathematical, science, of, logic, likewise, had, revolutionary, breakthroughs, after, a, similarly, long, period, of, stagnation, but, the, most, important, step, in, science, at, this, time, were, the, ideas, formulated, by, the, creators, of, electrical, science, their, work, changed, the, face, of, physics, and, made, possible, for, new, technology, to, come, about, such, as, electric, power, electrical, telegraphy, the, telephone, and, radio, in, chemistry, dmitri, mendeleev, following, the, atomic, theory, of, john, dalton, created, the, first, periodic, table, of, elements, other, highlights, include, the, discoveries, unveiling, the, nature, of, atomic, structure, and, matter, simultaneously, with, chemistry, and, of, new, kinds, of, radiation, the, theory, that, all, matter, is, made, of, atoms, which, are, the, smallest, constituents, of, matter, that, cannot, be, broken, down, without, losing, the, basic, chemical, and, physical, properties, of, that, matter, was, provided, by, john, dalton, in, 1803, although, the, question, took, a, hundred, years, to, settle, as, proven, dalton, also, formulated, the, law, of, mass, relationships, in, 1869, dmitri, mendeleev, composed, his, periodic, table, of, elements, on, the, basis, of, dalton, s, discoveries, the, synthesis, of, urea, by, friedrich, w, hler, opened, a, new, research, field, organic, chemistry, and, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, scientists, were, able, to, synthesize, hundreds, of, organic, compounds, the, later, part, of, the, 19th, century, saw, the, exploitation, of, the, earth, s, petrochemicals, after, the, exhaustion, of, the, oil, supply, from, whaling, by, the, 20th, century, systematic, production, of, refined, materials, provided, a, ready, supply, of, products, which, provided, not, only, energy, but, also, synthetic, materials, for, clothing, medicine, and, everyday, disposable, resources, application, of, the, techniques, of, organic, chemistry, to, living, organisms, resulted, in, physiological, chemistry, the, precursor, to, biochemistry, over, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, geologists, such, as, charles, lyell, adam, sedgwick, and, roderick, murchison, applied, the, new, technique, to, rocks, throughout, europe, and, eastern, north, america, setting, the, stage, for, more, detailed, government, funded, mapping, projects, in, later, decades, midway, through, the, 19th, century, the, focus, of, geology, shifted, from, description, and, classification, to, attempts, to, understand, how, the, surface, of, the, earth, had, changed, the, first, comprehensive, theories, of, mountain, building, were, proposed, during, this, period, as, were, the, first, modern, theories, of, earthquakes, and, volcanoes, louis, agassiz, and, others, established, the, reality, of, continent, covering, ice, ages, and, fluvialists, like, andrew, crombie, ramsay, argued, that, river, valleys, were, formed, over, millions, of, years, by, the, rivers, that, flow, through, them, after, the, discovery, of, radioactivity, radiometric, dating, methods, were, developed, starting, in, the, 20th, century, alfred, wegener, s, theory, of, continental, drift, was, widely, dismissed, when, he, proposed, it, in, the, 1910s, but, new, data, gathered, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, led, to, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, which, provided, a, plausible, mechanism, for, it, plate, tectonics, also, provided, a, unified, explanation, for, a, wide, range, of, seemingly, unrelated, geological, phenomena, since, the, 1960s, it, has, served, as, the, unifying, principle, in, geology, perhaps, the, most, prominent, controversial, and, far, reaching, theory, in, all, of, science, has, been, the, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, which, was, independently, formulated, by, charles, darwin, and, alfred, wallace, it, was, described, in, detail, in, darwin, s, book, the, origin, of, species, which, was, published, in, 1859, in, it, darwin, proposed, that, the, features, of, all, living, things, including, humans, were, shaped, by, natural, processes, over, long, periods, of, time, the, theory, of, evolution, in, its, current, form, affects, almost, all, areas, of, biology, implications, of, evolution, on, fields, outside, of, pure, science, have, led, to, both, opposition, and, support, from, different, parts, of, society, and, profoundly, influenced, the, popular, understanding, of, man, s, place, in, the, universe, separately, gregor, mendel, formulated, in, the, principles, of, inheritance, in, 1866, which, became, the, basis, of, modern, genetics, another, important, landmark, in, medicine, and, biology, were, the, successful, efforts, to, prove, the, germ, theory, of, disease, following, this, louis, pasteur, made, the, first, vaccine, against, rabies, and, also, made, many, discoveries, in, the, field, of, chemistry, including, the, asymmetry, of, crystals, in, 1847, hungarian, physician, ign, c, f, l, p, semmelweis, dramatically, reduced, the, occurrence, of, puerperal, fever, by, simply, requiring, physicians, to, wash, their, hands, before, attending, to, women, in, childbirth, this, discovery, predated, the, germ, theory, of, disease, however, semmelweis, findings, were, not, appreciated, by, his, contemporaries, and, handwashing, came, into, use, only, with, discoveries, by, british, surgeon, joseph, lister, who, in, 1865, proved, the, principles, of, antisepsis, lister, s, work, was, based, on, the, important, findings, by, french, biologist, louis, pasteur, pasteur, was, able, to, link, microorganisms, with, disease, revolutionizing, medicine, he, also, devised, one, of, the, most, important, methods, in, preventive, medicine, when, in, 1880, he, produced, a, vaccine, against, rabies, pasteur, invented, the, process, of, pasteurization, to, help, prevent, the, spread, of, disease, through, milk, and, other, foods, karl, marx, developed, an, alternative, economic, theory, called, marxian, economics, marxian, economics, is, based, on, the, labor, theory, of, value, and, assumes, the, value, of, good, to, be, based, on, the, amount, of, labor, required, to, produce, it, under, this, axiom, capitalism, was, based, on, employers, not, paying, the, full, value, of, workers, labor, to, create, profit, the, austrian, school, responded, to, marxian, economics, by, viewing, entrepreneurship, as, driving, force, of, economic, development, this, replaced, the, labor, theory, of, value, by, a, system, of, supply, and, demand, psychology, as, a, scientific, enterprise, that, was, independent, from, philosophy, began, in, 1879, when, wilhelm, wundt, founded, the, first, laboratory, dedicated, exclusively, to, psychological, research, in, leipzig, other, important, early, contributors, to, the, field, include, hermann, ebbinghaus, a, pioneer, in, memory, studies, ivan, pavlov, who, discovered, classical, conditioning, william, james, and, sigmund, freud, freud, s, influence, has, been, enormous, though, more, as, cultural, icon, than, a, force, in, scientific, psychology, modern, sociology, emerged, in, the, early, 19th, century, as, the, academic, response, to, the, modernization, of, the, world, among, many, early, sociologists, e, g, mile, durkheim, the, aim, of, sociology, was, in, structuralism, understanding, the, cohesion, of, social, groups, and, developing, an, antidote, to, social, disintegration, max, weber, was, concerned, with, the, modernization, of, society, through, the, concept, of, rationalization, which, he, believed, would, trap, individuals, in, an, iron, cage, of, rational, thought, some, sociologists, including, georg, simmel, and, w, e, b, du, bois, used, more, microsociological, qualitative, analyses, this, microlevel, approach, played, an, important, role, in, american, sociology, with, the, theories, of, george, herbert, mead, and, his, student, herbert, blumer, resulting, in, the, creation, of, the, symbolic, interactionism, approach, to, sociology, in, particular, just, auguste, comte, illustrated, with, his, work, the, transition, from, a, theological, to, a, metaphysical, stage, and, from, this, to, a, positive, stage, comte, took, care, of, the, classification, of, the, sciences, as, well, as, a, transit, of, humanity, towards, a, situation, of, progress, attributable, to, a, re, examination, of, nature, according, to, the, affirmation, of, sociality, as, the, basis, of, the, scientifically, interpreted, society, the, romantic, movement, of, the, early, 19th, century, reshaped, science, by, opening, up, new, pursuits, unexpected, in, the, classical, approaches, of, the, enlightenment, the, decline, of, romanticism, occurred, because, a, new, movement, positivism, began, to, take, hold, of, the, ideals, of, the, intellectuals, after, 1840, and, lasted, until, about, 1880, at, the, same, time, the, romantic, reaction, to, the, enlightenment, produced, thinkers, such, as, johann, gottfried, herder, and, later, wilhelm, dilthey, whose, work, formed, the, basis, for, the, culture, concept, which, is, central, to, the, discipline, traditionally, much, of, the, history, of, the, subject, was, based, on, colonial, encounters, between, western, europe, and, the, rest, of, the, world, and, much, of, 18th, and, 19th, century, anthropology, is, now, classed, as, scientific, racism, during, the, late, 19th, century, battles, over, the, study, of, man, took, place, between, those, of, an, anthropological, persuasion, relying, on, anthropometrical, techniques, and, those, of, an, ethnological, persuasion, looking, at, cultures, and, traditions, and, these, distinctions, became, part, of, the, later, divide, between, physical, anthropology, and, cultural, anthropology, the, latter, ushered, in, by, the, students, of, franz, boas, science, advanced, dramatically, during, the, 20th, century, there, were, new, and, radical, developments, in, the, physical, and, life, sciences, building, on, the, progress, from, the, 19th, century, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, brought, the, start, of, a, revolution, in, physics, the, long, held, theories, of, newton, were, shown, not, to, be, correct, in, all, circumstances, beginning, in, 1900, max, planck, albert, einstein, niels, bohr, and, others, developed, quantum, theories, to, explain, various, anomalous, experimental, results, by, introducing, discrete, energy, levels, not, only, did, quantum, mechanics, show, that, the, laws, of, motion, did, not, hold, on, small, scales, but, the, theory, of, general, relativity, proposed, by, einstein, in, 1915, showed, that, the, fixed, background, of, spacetime, on, which, both, newtonian, mechanics, and, special, relativity, depended, could, not, exist, in, 1925, werner, heisenberg, and, erwin, schr, dinger, formulated, quantum, mechanics, which, explained, the, preceding, quantum, theories, currently, general, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, are, inconsistent, with, each, other, and, efforts, are, underway, to, unify, the, two, the, observation, by, edwin, hubble, in, 1929, that, the, speed, at, which, galaxies, recede, positively, correlates, with, their, distance, led, to, the, understanding, that, the, universe, is, expanding, and, the, formulation, of, the, big, bang, theory, by, georges, lema, tre, george, gamow, ralph, alpher, and, robert, herman, had, calculated, that, there, should, be, evidence, for, a, big, bang, in, the, background, temperature, of, the, universe, in, 1964, arno, penzias, and, robert, wilson, discovered, a, 3, kelvin, background, hiss, in, their, bell, labs, radiotelescope, the, holmdel, horn, antenna, which, was, evidence, for, this, hypothesis, and, formed, the, basis, for, a, number, of, results, that, helped, determine, the, age, of, the, universe, in, 1938, otto, hahn, and, fritz, strassmann, discovered, nuclear, fission, with, radiochemical, methods, and, in, 1939, lise, meitner, and, otto, robert, frisch, wrote, the, first, theoretical, interpretation, of, the, fission, process, which, was, later, improved, by, niels, bohr, and, john, a, wheeler, further, developments, took, place, during, world, war, ii, which, led, to, the, practical, application, of, radar, and, the, development, and, use, of, the, atomic, bomb, around, this, time, chien, shiung, wu, was, recruited, by, the, manhattan, project, to, help, develop, a, process, for, separating, uranium, metal, into, u, 235, and, u, 238, isotopes, by, gaseous, diffusion, she, was, an, expert, experimentalist, in, beta, decay, and, weak, interaction, physics, wu, designed, an, experiment, see, wu, experiment, that, enabled, theoretical, physicists, tsung, dao, lee, and, chen, ning, yang, to, disprove, the, law, of, parity, experimentally, winning, them, a, nobel, prize, in, 1957, though, the, process, had, begun, with, the, invention, of, the, cyclotron, by, ernest, o, lawrence, in, the, 1930s, physics, in, the, postwar, period, entered, into, a, phase, of, what, historians, have, called, big, science, requiring, massive, machines, budgets, and, laboratories, in, order, to, test, their, theories, and, move, into, new, frontiers, the, primary, patron, of, physics, became, state, governments, who, recognized, that, the, support, of, basic, research, could, often, lead, to, technologies, useful, to, both, military, and, industrial, applications, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, study, of, heredity, became, a, major, investigation, after, the, rediscovery, in, 1900, of, the, laws, of, inheritance, developed, by, mendel, the, 20th, century, also, saw, the, integration, of, physics, and, chemistry, with, chemical, properties, explained, as, the, result, of, the, electronic, structure, of, the, atom, linus, pauling, s, book, on, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, used, the, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, to, deduce, bond, angles, in, ever, more, complicated, molecules, pauling, s, work, culminated, in, the, physical, modelling, of, dna, the, secret, of, life, in, the, words, of, francis, crick, 1953, in, the, same, year, the, miller, urey, experiment, demonstrated, in, a, simulation, of, primordial, processes, that, basic, constituents, of, proteins, simple, amino, acids, could, themselves, be, built, up, from, simpler, molecules, kickstarting, decades, of, research, into, the, chemical, origins, of, life, by, 1953, james, d, watson, and, francis, crick, clarified, the, basic, structure, of, dna, the, genetic, material, for, expressing, life, in, all, its, forms, building, on, the, work, of, maurice, wilkins, and, rosalind, franklin, suggested, that, the, structure, of, dna, was, a, double, helix, in, their, famous, paper, molecular, structure, of, nucleic, acids, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, possibilities, of, genetic, engineering, became, practical, for, the, first, time, and, a, massive, international, effort, began, in, 1990, to, map, out, an, entire, human, genome, the, human, genome, project, the, discipline, of, ecology, typically, traces, its, origin, to, the, synthesis, of, darwinian, evolution, and, humboldtian, biogeography, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, equally, important, in, the, rise, of, ecology, however, were, microbiology, and, soil, science, particularly, the, cycle, of, life, concept, prominent, in, the, work, louis, pasteur, and, ferdinand, cohn, the, word, ecology, was, coined, by, ernst, haeckel, whose, particularly, holistic, view, of, nature, in, general, and, darwin, s, theory, in, particular, was, important, in, the, spread, of, ecological, thinking, the, field, of, ecosystem, ecology, emerged, in, the, atomic, age, with, the, use, of, radioisotopes, to, visualize, food, webs, and, by, the, 1970s, ecosystem, ecology, deeply, influenced, global, environmental, management, in, 1925, cecilia, payne, gaposchkin, determined, that, stars, were, composed, mostly, of, hydrogen, and, helium, she, was, dissuaded, by, astronomer, henry, norris, russell, from, publishing, this, finding, in, her, phd, thesis, because, of, the, widely, held, belief, that, stars, had, the, same, composition, as, the, earth, however, four, years, later, in, 1929, henry, norris, russell, came, to, the, same, conclusion, through, different, reasoning, and, the, discovery, was, eventually, accepted, in, 1987, supernova, sn, 1987a, was, observed, by, astronomers, on, earth, both, visually, and, in, a, triumph, for, neutrino, astronomy, by, the, solar, neutrino, detectors, at, kamiokande, but, the, solar, neutrino, flux, was, a, fraction, of, its, theoretically, expected, value, this, discrepancy, forced, a, change, in, some, values, in, the, standard, model, for, particle, physics, the, understanding, of, neurons, and, the, nervous, system, became, increasingly, precise, and, molecular, during, the, 20th, century, for, example, in, 1952, alan, lloyd, hodgkin, and, andrew, huxley, presented, a, mathematical, model, for, transmission, of, electrical, signals, in, neurons, of, the, giant, axon, of, a, squid, which, they, called, action, potentials, and, how, they, are, initiated, and, propagated, known, as, the, hodgkin, huxley, model, in, 1961, 1962, richard, fitzhugh, and, j, nagumo, simplified, hodgkin, huxley, in, what, is, called, the, fitzhugh, nagumo, model, in, 1962, bernard, katz, modeled, neurotransmission, across, the, space, between, neurons, known, as, synapses, beginning, in, 1966, eric, kandel, and, collaborators, examined, biochemical, changes, in, neurons, associated, with, learning, and, memory, storage, in, aplysia, in, 1981, catherine, morris, and, harold, lecar, combined, these, models, in, the, morris, lecar, model, such, increasingly, quantitative, work, gave, rise, to, numerous, biological, neuron, models, and, models, of, neural, computation, neuroscience, began, to, be, recognized, as, a, distinct, academic, discipline, in, its, own, right, eric, kandel, and, collaborators, have, cited, david, rioch, francis, o, schmitt, and, stephen, kuffler, as, having, played, critical, roles, in, establishing, the, field, geologists, embrace, of, plate, tectonics, became, part, of, a, broadening, of, the, field, from, a, study, of, rocks, into, a, study, of, the, earth, as, a, planet, other, elements, of, this, transformation, include, geophysical, studies, of, the, interior, of, the, earth, the, grouping, of, geology, with, meteorology, and, oceanography, as, one, of, the, earth, sciences, and, comparisons, of, earth, and, the, solar, system, s, other, rocky, planets, in, terms, of, applications, a, massive, number, of, new, technologies, were, developed, in, the, 20th, century, technologies, such, as, electricity, the, incandescent, light, bulb, the, automobile, and, the, phonograph, first, developed, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, were, perfected, and, universally, deployed, the, first, car, was, introduced, by, karl, benz, in, 1885, the, first, airplane, flight, occurred, in, 1903, and, by, the, end, of, the, century, airliners, flew, thousands, of, miles, in, a, matter, of, hours, the, development, of, the, radio, television, and, computers, caused, massive, changes, in, the, dissemination, of, information, advances, in, biology, also, led, to, large, increases, in, food, production, as, well, as, the, elimination, of, diseases, such, as, polio, by, dr, jonas, salk, gene, mapping, and, gene, sequencing, invented, by, drs, mark, skolnik, and, walter, gilbert, respectively, are, the, two, technologies, that, made, the, human, genome, project, feasible, computer, science, built, upon, a, foundation, of, theoretical, linguistics, discrete, mathematics, and, electrical, engineering, studies, the, nature, and, limits, of, computation, subfields, include, computability, computational, complexity, database, design, computer, networking, artificial, intelligence, and, the, design, of, computer, hardware, one, area, in, which, advances, in, computing, have, contributed, to, more, general, scientific, development, is, by, facilitating, large, scale, archiving, of, scientific, data, contemporary, computer, science, typically, distinguishes, itself, by, emphasizing, mathematical, theory, in, contrast, to, the, practical, emphasis, of, software, engineering, einstein, s, paper, on, the, quantum, theory, of, radiation, outlined, the, principles, of, the, stimulated, emission, of, photons, this, led, to, the, invention, of, the, laser, light, amplification, by, the, stimulated, emission, of, radiation, and, the, optical, amplifier, which, ushered, in, the, information, age, it, is, optical, amplification, that, allows, fiber, optic, networks, to, transmit, the, massive, capacity, of, the, internet, based, on, wireless, transmission, of, electromagnetic, radiation, and, global, networks, of, cellular, operation, the, mobile, phone, became, a, primary, means, to, access, the, internet, in, political, science, during, the, 20th, century, the, study, of, ideology, behaviouralism, and, international, relations, led, to, a, multitude, of, pol, sci, subdisciplines, including, rational, choice, theory, voting, theory, game, theory, also, used, in, economics, psephology, political, geography, geopolitics, political, anthropology, political, psychology, political, sociology, political, economy, policy, analysis, public, administration, comparative, political, analysis, and, peace, studies, conflict, analysis, in, economics, john, maynard, keynes, prompted, a, division, between,

new, classical, economics, was, developed, in, the, 1970s, emphasizing, solid, microeconomics, as, the, basis, for, macroeconomic, growth, new, keynesian, economics, was, created, partially, in, response, to, new, classical, economics, it, shows, how, imperfect, competition, and, market, rigidities, means, monetary, policy, has, real, effects, and, enables, analysis, of, different, policies, psychology, in, the, 20th, century, saw, a, rejection, of, freud, s, theories, as, being, too, unscientific, and, a, reaction, against, edward, titchener, s, atomistic, approach, of, the, mind, this, led, to, the, formulation, of, behaviorism, by, john, b, watson, which, was, popularized, by, b, f, skinner, behaviorism, proposed, epistemologically, limiting, psychological, study, to, overt, behavior, since, that, could, be, reliably, measured, scientific, knowledge, of, the, mind, was, considered, too, metaphysical, hence, impossible, to, achieve, the, final, decades, of, the, 20th, century, have, seen, the, rise, of, cognitive, science, which, considers, the, mind, as, once, again, a, subject, for, investigation, using, the, tools, of, psychology, linguistics, computer, science, philosophy, and, neurobiology, new, methods, of, visualizing, the, activity, of, the, brain, such, as, pet, scans, and, cat, scans, began, to, exert, their, influence, as, well, leading, some, researchers, to, investigate, the, mind, by, investigating, the, brain, rather, than, cognition, these, new, forms, of, investigation, assume, that, a, wide, understanding, of, the, human, mind, is, possible, and, that, such, an, understanding, may, be, applied, to, other, research, domains, such, as, artificial, intelligence, evolutionary, theory, was, applied, to, behavior, and, introduced, to, anthropology, and, psychology, through, the, works, of, cultural, anthropologist, napoleon, chagnon, physical, anthropology, would, become, biological, anthropology, incorporating, elements, of, evolutionary, biology, american, sociology, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, was, dominated, largely, by, talcott, parsons, who, argued, that, aspects, of, society, that, promoted, structural, integration, were, therefore, functional, this, structural, functionalism, approach, was, questioned, in, the, 1960s, when, sociologists, came, to, see, this, approach, as, merely, a, justification, for, inequalities, present, in, the, status, quo, in, reaction, conflict, theory, was, developed, which, was, based, in, part, on, the, philosophies, of, karl, marx, conflict, theorists, saw, society, as, an, arena, in, which, different, groups, compete, for, control, over, resources, symbolic, interactionism, also, came, to, be, regarded, as, central, to, sociological, thinking, erving, goffman, saw, social, interactions, as, a, stage, performance, with, individuals, preparing, backstage, and, attempting, to, control, their, audience, through, impression, management, while, these, theories, are, currently, prominent, in, sociological, thought, other, approaches, exist, including, feminist, theory, post, structuralism, rational, choice, theory, and, postmodernism, in, the, mid, 20th, century, much, of, the, methodologies, of, earlier, anthropological, and, ethnographical, study, were, reevaluated, with, an, eye, towards, research, ethics, while, at, the, same, time, the, scope, of, investigation, has, broadened, far, beyond, the, traditional, study, of, primitive, cultures, in, the, early, 21st, century, some, concepts, that, originated, in, 20th, century, physics, were, proven, on, 4, july, 2012, physicists, working, at, cern, s, large, hadron, collider, announced, that, they, had, discovered, a, new, subatomic, particle, greatly, resembling, the, higgs, boson, confirmed, as, such, by, the, following, march, gravitational, waves, were, first, detected, on, 14, september, 2015, the, human, genome, project, was, declared, complete, in, 2003, the, crispr, gene, editing, technique, developed, in, 2012, allowed, scientists, to, precisely, and, easily, modify, dna, and, led, to, the, development, of, new, medicine, in, 2020, xenobots, a, new, class, of, living, robotics, were, invented, reproductive, capabilities, were, introduced, the, following, year, positive, psychology, is, a, branch, of, psychology, founded, in, 1998, by, martin, seligman, that, is,
