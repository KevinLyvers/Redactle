during, which, the, british, empire, became, the, global, hegemon, was, later, described, as, pax, britannica, latin, for, british, peace, alongside, the, formal, control, that, britain, exerted, over, its, colonies, its, dominance, of, much, of, world, trade, and, of, its, oceans, meant, that, it, effectively, controlled, the, economies, of, and, readily, enforced, its, interests, in, many, regions, such, as, asia, and, latin, america, it, also, came, to, dominate, the, middle, east, increasing, degrees, of, autonomy, were, granted, to, its, white, settler, colonies, some, of, which, were, formally, reclassified, as, dominions, by, the, 1920s, by, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, germany, and, the, united, states, had, begun, to, challenge, britain, s, economic, lead, military, economic, and, colonial, tensions, between, britain, and, germany, were, major, causes, of, the, first, world, war, during, which, britain, relied, heavily, on, its, empire, the, conflict, placed, enormous, strain, on, its, military, financial, and, manpower, resources, although, the, empire, achieved, its, largest, territorial, extent, immediately, after, the, first, world, war, britain, was, no, longer, the, world, s, preeminent, industrial, or, military, power, in, the, second, world, war, britain, s, colonies, in, east, asia, and, southeast, asia, were, occupied, by, the, empire, of,

s, most, valuable, and, populous, possession, achieved, independence, in, 1947, as, part, of, a, larger, decolonisation, movement, in, which, britain, granted, independence, to, most, territories, of, the, empire, the, suez, crisis, of, 1956, confirmed, britain, s, decline, as, a, global, power, and, the, handover, of, hong, kong, to, china, on, 1, july, 1997, symbolised, for, many, the, end, of, the, british, empire, though, fourteen, overseas, territories, that, are, remnants, of, the, empire, remain, under, british, sovereignty, after, independence, many, former, british, colonies, along, with, most, of, the, dominions, joined, the, commonwealth, of, nations, which, has, been, a, free, association, of, independent, states, since, the, 1949, london, declaration, fifteen, of, these,

separate, kingdoms, in, 1496, king, henry, vii, of, england, following, the, successes, of, spain, and, portugal, in, overseas, exploration, commissioned, john, cabot, to, lead, an, expedition, to, discover, a, northwest, passage, to, asia, via, the, north, atlantic, cabot, sailed, in, 1497, five, years, after, the, first, voyage, of, christopher, columbus, and, made, landfall, on, the, coast, of, newfoundland, he, believed, he, had, reached, asia, and, there, was, no, attempt, to, found, a, colony, cabot, led, another, voyage, to, the, americas, the, following, year, but, did, not, return, it, is, unknown, what, happened, to, his, ships, no, further, attempts, to, establish, english, colonies, in, the, americas, were, made, until, well, into, the, reign, of, queen, elizabeth, i, during, the, last, decades, of, the, 16th, century, in, the, meantime, henry, viii, s, 1533, statute, in, restraint, of, appeals, had, declared, that, this, realm, of, england, is, an, empire, the, protestant, reformation, turned, england, and, catholic, spain, into, implacable, enemies, in, 1562, elizabeth, i, encouraged, the, privateers, john, hawkins, and, francis, drake, to, engage, in, slave, raiding, attacks, against, spanish, and, portuguese, ships, off, the, coast, of, west, africa, with, the, aim, of, establishing, an, atlantic, slave, trade, this, effort, was, rebuffed, and, later, as, the, anglo, spanish, wars, intensified, elizabeth, i, gave, her, blessing, to, further, privateering, raids, against, spanish, ports, in, the, americas, and, shipping, that, was, returning, across, the, atlantic, laden, with, treasure, from, the, new, world, at, the, same, time, influential, writers, such, as, richard, hakluyt, and, john, dee, who, was, the, first, to, use, the, term, british, empire, were, beginning, to, press, for, the, establishment, of, england, s, own, empire, by, this, time, spain, had, become, the, dominant, power, in, the, americas, and, was, exploring, the, pacific, ocean, portugal, had, established, trading, posts, and, forts, from, the, coasts, of, africa, and, brazil, to, china, and, france, had, begun, to, settle, the, saint, lawrence, river, area, later, to, become, new, france, although, england, tended, to, trail, behind, portugal, spain, and, france, in, establishing, overseas, colonies, it, carried, out, its, first, modern, colonisation, referred, to, as, the, munster, plantations, in, 16th, century, ireland, by, settling, it, with, english, and, welsh, protestant, settlers, england, had, already, colonised, part, of, the, country, following, the, norman, invasion, of, ireland, in, 1169, several, people, who, helped, establish, the, munster, plantations, later, played, a, part, in, the, early, colonisation, of, north, america, particularly, a, group, known, as, the, west, country, men, in, 1578, elizabeth, i, granted, a, patent, to, humphrey, gilbert, for, discovery, and, overseas, exploration, that, year, gilbert, sailed, for, the, caribbean, with, the, intention, of, engaging, in, piracy, and, establishing, a, colony, in, north, america, but, the, expedition, was, aborted, before, it, had, crossed, the, atlantic, in, 1583, he, embarked, on, a, second, attempt, on, this, occasion, he, formally, claimed, the, harbour, of, the, island, of, newfoundland, although, no, settlers, were, left, behind, gilbert, did, not, survive, the, return, journey, to, england, and, was, succeeded, by, his, half, brother, walter, raleigh, who, was, granted, his, own, patent, by, elizabeth, in, 1584, later, that, year, raleigh, founded, the, roanoke, colony, on, the, coast, of, present, day, north, carolina, but, lack, of, supplies, caused, the, colony, to, fail, in, 1603, james, vi, of, scotland, ascended, as, james, i, to, the, english, throne, and, in, 1604, negotiated, the, treaty, of, london, ending, hostilities, with, spain, now, at, peace, with, its, main, rival, english, attention, shifted, from, preying, on, other, nations, colonial, infrastructures, to, the, business, of, establishing, its, own, overseas, colonies, the, british, empire, began, to, take, shape, during, the, early, 17th, century, with, the, english, settlement, of, north, america, and, the, smaller, islands, of, the, caribbean, and, the, establishment, of, joint, stock, companies, most, notably, the, east, india, company, to, administer, colonies, and, overseas, trade, this, period, until, the, loss, of, the, thirteen, colonies, after, the, american, war, of, independence, towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, has, been, referred, to, by, some, historians, as, the, first, british, empire, england, s, early, efforts, at, colonisation, in, the, americas, met, with, mixed, success, an, attempt, to, establish, a, colony, in, guiana, in, 1604, lasted, only, two, years, and, failed, in, its, main, objective, to, find, gold, deposits, colonies, on, the, caribbean, islands, of, st, lucia, 1605, and, grenada, 1609, rapidly, folded, the, first, permanent, english, settlement, in, the, americas, was, founded, in, 1607, in, jamestown, by, captain, john, smith, and, managed, by, the, virginia, company, the, crown, took, direct, control, of, the, venture, in, 1624, thereby, founding, the, colony, of, virginia, bermuda, was, settled, and, claimed, by, england, as, a, result, of, the, 1609, shipwreck, of, the, virginia, company, s, flagship, while, attempts, to, settle, newfoundland, were, largely, unsuccessful, in, 1620, plymouth, was, founded, as, a, haven, by, puritan, religious, separatists, later, known, as, the, pilgrims, fleeing, from, religious, persecution, would, become, the, motive, for, many, english, would, be, colonists, to, risk, the, arduous, trans, atlantic, voyage, maryland, was, established, by, english, roman, catholics, 1634, rhode, island, 1636, as, a, colony, tolerant, of, all, religions, and, connecticut, 1639, for, congregationalists, england, s, north, american, holdings, were, further, expanded, by, the, annexation, of, the, dutch, colony, of, new, netherland, in, 1664, following, the, capture, of, new, amsterdam, which, was, renamed, new, york, although, less, financially, successful, than, colonies, in, the, caribbean, these, territories, had, large, areas, of, good, agricultural, land, and, attracted, far, greater, numbers, of, english, emigrants, who, preferred, their, temperate, climates, the, british, west, indies, initially, provided, england, s, most, important, and, lucrative, colonies, settlements, were, successfully, established, in, st, kitts, 1624, barbados, 1627, and, nevis, 1628, but, struggled, until, the, sugar, revolution, transformed, the, caribbean, economy, in, the, mid, 17th, century, large, sugarcane, plantations, were, first, established, in, the, 1640s, on, barbados, with, assistance, from, dutch, merchants, and, sephardic, jews, fleeing, portuguese, brazil, at, first, sugar, was, grown, primarily, using, white, indentured, labour, but, rising, costs, soon, led, english, traders, to, embrace, the, use, of, imported, african, slaves, the, enormous, wealth, generated, by, slave, produced, sugar, made, barbados, the, most, successful, colony, in, the, americas, and, one, of, the, most, densely, populated, places, in, the, world, this, boom, led, to, the, spread, of, sugar, cultivation, across, the, caribbean, financed, the, development, of, non, plantation, colonies, in, north, america, and, accelerated, the, growth, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, particularly, the, triangular, trade, of, slaves, sugar, and, provisions, between, africa, the, west, indies, and, europe, to, ensure, that, the, increasingly, healthy, profits, of, colonial, trade, remained, in, english, hands, parliament, decreed, in, 1651, that, only, english, ships, would, be, able, to, ply, their, trade, in, english, colonies, this, led, to, hostilities, with, the, united, dutch, provinces, a, series, of, anglo, dutch, wars, which, would, eventually, strengthen, england, s, position, in, the, americas, at, the, expense, of, the, dutch, in, 1655, england, annexed, the, island, of, jamaica, from, the, spanish, and, in, 1666, succeeded, in, colonising, the, bahamas, in, 1670, charles, ii, incorporated, by, royal, charter, the, hudson, s, bay, company, hbc, granting, it, a, monopoly, on, the, fur, trade, in, the, area, known, as, rupert, s, land, which, would, later, form, a, large, proportion, of, the, dominion, of, canada, forts, and, trading, posts, established, by, the, hbc, were, frequently, the, subject, of, attacks, by, the, french, who, had, established, their, own, fur, trading, colony, in, adjacent, new, france, two, years, later, the, royal, african, company, was, granted, a, monopoly, on, the, supply, of, slaves, to, the, british, colonies, in, the, caribbean, the, company, would, transport, more, slaves, across, the, atlantic, than, any, other, and, significantly, grew, england, s, share, of, the, trade, from, 33, per, cent, in, 1673, to, 74, per, cent, in, 1683, the, removal, of, this, monopoly, between, 1688, and, 1712, allowed, independent, british, slave, traders, to, thrive, leading, to, a, rapid, escalation, in, the, number, of, slaves, transported, british, ships, carried, a, third, of, all, slaves, shipped, across, the, atlantic, approximately, 3, 5, million, africans, until, the, abolition, of, the, trade, by, parliament, in, 1807, see, abolition, of, slavery, to, facilitate, the, shipment, of, slaves, forts, were, established, on, the, coast, of, west, africa, such, as, james, island, accra, and, bunce, island, in, the, british, caribbean, the, percentage, of, the, population, of, african, descent, rose, from, 25, per, cent, in, 1650, to, around, 80, per, cent, in, 1780, and, in, the, thirteen, colonies, from, 10, per, cent, to, 40, per, cent, over, the, same, period, the, majority, in, the, southern, colonies, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, played, a, pervasive, role, in, british, economic, life, and, became, a, major, economic, mainstay, for, western, port, cities, ships, registered, in, bristol, liverpool, and, london, were, responsible, for, the, bulk, of, british, slave, trading, for, the, transported, harsh, and, unhygienic, conditions, on, the, slaving, ships, and, poor, diets, meant, that, the, average, mortality, rate, during, the, middle, passage, was, one, in, seven, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, england, and, the, dutch, empire, began, to, challenge, the, portuguese, empire, s, monopoly, of, trade, with, asia, forming, private, joint, stock, companies, to, finance, the, voyages, the, english, later, british, east, india, company, and, the, dutch, east, india, company, chartered, in, 1600, and, 1602, respectively, the, primary, aim, of, these, companies, was, to, tap, into, the, lucrative, spice, trade, an, effort, focused, mainly, on, two, regions, the, east, indies, archipelago, and, an, important, hub, in, the, trade, network, india, there, they, competed, for, trade, supremacy, with, portugal, and, with, each, other, although, england, eclipsed, the, netherlands, as, a, colonial, power, in, the, short, term, the, netherlands, more, advanced, financial, system, and, the, three, anglo, dutch, wars, of, the, 17th, century, left, it, with, a, stronger, position, in, asia, hostilities, ceased, after, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, when, the, dutch, william, of, orange, ascended, the, english, throne, bringing, peace, between, the, dutch, republic, and, england, a, deal, between, the, two, nations, left, the, spice, trade, of, the, east, indies, archipelago, to, the, netherlands, and, the, textiles, industry, of, india, to,

allies, but, the, conflict, waged, in, europe, and, overseas, between, france, spain, and, the, anglo, dutch, alliance, left, the, english, a, stronger, colonial, power, than, the, dutch, who, were, forced, to, devote, a, larger, proportion, of, their, military, budget, to, the, costly, land, war, in, europe, the, death, of, charles, ii, of, spain, in, 1700, and, his, bequeathal, of, spain, and,

france, in, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, which, lasted, for, thirteen, years, in, 1695, the, parliament, of, scotland, granted, a, charter, to, the, company, of, scotland, which, established, a, settlement, in, 1698, on, the, isthmus, of, panama, besieged, by, neighbouring, spanish, colonists, of, new, granada, and, affected, by, malaria, the, colony, was, abandoned, two, years, later, the, darien, scheme, was, a, financial, disaster, for, scotland, a, quarter, of, scottish, capital, was, lost, in, the, enterprise, the, episode, had, major, political, consequences, helping, to, persuade, the, government, of, the, kingdom, of, scotland, of, the, merits, of, turning, the, personal, union, with, england, into, a, political, and, economic, one, under, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, established, by, the, acts, of, union, 1707, the, 18th, century, saw, the, newly, united, great, britain, rise, to, be, the, world, s, dominant, colonial, power, with, france,

routes, in, 1746, the, spanish, and, british, began, peace, talks, with, the, king, of, spain, agreeing, to, stop, all, attacks, on, british, shipping, however, in, the, 1750, treaty, of, madrid, britain, lost, its, slave, trading, rights, in, latin, america, in, the, east, indies, british, and, dutch, merchants, continued, to, compete, in, spices, and, textiles, with, textiles, becoming, the, larger, trade, by, 1720, in, terms, of, sales, the, british, company, had, overtaken, the, dutch, during, the, middle, decades, of, the, 18th, century, there, were, several, outbreaks, of, military, conflict, on, the, indian, subcontinent, as, the, english, east, india, company, and, its, french, counterpart, struggled, alongside, local, rulers, to, fill, the, vacuum, that, had, been, left, by, the, decline, of, the, mughal, empire, the, battle, of, plassey, in, 1757, in, which, the, british, defeated, the, nawab, of, bengal, and, his, french, allies, left, the, british, east, india, company, in, control, of, bengal, and, as, a, major, military, and, political, power, in, india, france, was, left, control, of, its, enclaves, but, with, military, restrictions, and, an, obligation, to, support, british, client, states, ending, french, hopes, of, controlling, india, in, the, following, decades, the, british, east, india, company, gradually, increased, the, size, of, the, territories, under, its, control, either, ruling, directly, or, via, local, rulers, under, the, threat, of, force, from, the, presidency, armies, the, vast, majority, of, which, was, composed, of, indian, sepoys, led, by, british, officers, the, british, and, french, struggles, in, india, became, but, one, theatre, of, the, global, seven, years, war, 1756, 1763, involving, france, britain, and, the, other, major, european, powers, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, paris, of, 1763, had, important, consequences, for, the, future, of, the, british, empire, in, north, america, france, s, future, as, a, colonial, power, effectively, ended, with, the, recognition, of, british, claims, to, rupert, s, land, and, the, ceding, of, new, france, to, britain, leaving, a, sizeable, french, speaking, population, under, british, control, and, louisiana, to, spain, spain, ceded, florida, to, britain, along, with, its, victory, over, france, in, india, the, seven, years, war, therefore, left, britain, as, the, world, s, most, powerful, maritime, power, during, the, 1760s, and, early, 1770s, relations, between, the, thirteen, colonies, and, britain, became, increasingly, strained, primarily, because, of, resentment, of, the, british, parliament, s, attempts, to, govern, and, tax, american, colonists, without, their, consent, this, was, summarised, at, the, time, by, the, colonists, slogan, no, taxation, without, representation, a, perceived, violation, of, the, guaranteed, rights, of, englishmen, the, american, revolution, began, with, a, rejection, of, parliamentary, authority, and, moves, towards, self, government, in, response, britain, sent, troops, to, reimpose, direct, rule, leading, to, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1775, the, following, year, in, 1776, the, second, continental, congress, issued, the, declaration, of, independence, proclaiming, the, colonies, sovereignty, from, the, british, empire, as, the, new, united, states, of, america, the, entry, of, french, and, spanish, forces, into, the, war, tipped, the, military, balance, in, the, americans, favour, and, after, a, decisive, defeat, at, yorktown, in, 1781, britain, began, negotiating, peace, terms, american, independence, was, acknowledged, at, the, peace, of, paris, in, 1783, the, loss, of, such, a, large, portion, of, british, america, at, the, time, britain, s, most, populous, overseas, possession, is, seen, by, some, historians, as, the, event, defining, the, transition, between, the, first, and, second, empires, in, which, britain, shifted, its, attention, away, from, the, americas, to, asia, the, pacific, and, later, africa, adam, smith, s, wealth, of, nations, published, in, 1776, had, argued, that, colonies, were, redundant, and, that, free, trade, should, replace, the, old, mercantilist, policies, that, had, characterised, the, first, period, of, colonial, expansion, dating, back, to, the, protectionism, of, spain, and, portugal, the, growth, of, trade, between, the, newly, independent, united, states, and, britain, after, 1783, seemed, to, confirm, smith, s, view, that, political, control, was, not, necessary, for, economic, success, the, war, to, the, south, influenced, british, policy, in, canada, where, between, 40, 000, and, 100, 000, defeated, loyalists, had, migrated, from, the, new, united, states, following, independence, the, 14, 000, loyalists, who, went, to, the, saint, john, and, saint, croix, river, valleys, then, part, of, nova, scotia, felt, too, far, removed, from, the, provincial, government, in, halifax, so, london, split, off, new, brunswick, as, a, separate, colony, in, 1784, the, constitutional, act, of, 1791, created, the, provinces, of, upper, canada, mainly, english, speaking, and, lower, canada, mainly, french, speaking, to, defuse, tensions, between, the, french, and, british, communities, and, implemented, governmental, systems, similar, to, those, employed, in, britain, with, the,

britain, when, russia, invaded, the, ottoman, balkans, in, 1853, fears, of, russian, dominance, in, the, mediterranean, and, the, middle, east, led, britain, and, france, to, enter, the, war, in, support, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, invade, the, crimean, peninsula, to, destroy, russian, naval, capabilities, the, ensuing, crimean, war, 1854, 1856, which, involved, new, techniques, of,

boer, population, in, 1806, having, occupied, it, in, 1795, to, prevent, its, falling, into, french, hands, during, the, flanders, campaign, british, immigration, to, the, cape, colony, began, to, rise, after, 1820, and, pushed, thousands, of, boers, resentful, of, british, rule, northwards, to, found, their, own, mostly, short, lived, independent, republics, during, the, great, trek, of, the, late, 1830s, and, early, 1840s, in, the, process, the, voortrekkers, clashed, repeatedly, with, the, british, who, had, their, own, agenda, with, regard, to, colonial, expansion, in, south, africa, and, to, the, various, native, african, polities, including, those, of, the, sotho, people, and, the, zulu, kingdom, eventually, the, boers, established, two, republics, that, had, a, longer,

outright, british, occupation, in, 1882, although, britain, controlled, the, khedivate, of, egypt, into, the, 20th, century, it, was, officially, a, vassal, state, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, not, part, of, the, british, empire, the, french, were, still, majority, shareholders, and, attempted, to, weaken, the, british, position, but, a, compromise, was, reached, with, the, 1888, convention, of,

by, defining, effective, occupation, as, the, criterion, for, international, recognition, of, territorial, claims, the, scramble, continued, into, the, 1890s, and, caused, britain, to, reconsider, its, decision, in, 1885, to, withdraw, from, sudan, a, joint, force, of, british, and, egyptian, troops, defeated, the, mahdist, army, in, 1896, and, rebuffed, an, attempted, french, invasion, at,

washington, naval, treaty, where, britain, accepted, naval, parity, with, the, united, states, this, decision, was, the, source, of, much, debate, in, britain, during, the, 1930s, as, militaristic, governments, took, hold, in, germany, and, japan, helped, in, part, by, the, great, depression, for, it, was, feared, that, the, empire, could, not, survive, a, simultaneous, attack, by, both, nations, the, issue, of, the, empire, s, security, was, a, serious, concern, in, britain, as, it, was, vital, to, the, british, economy, in, 1919, the, frustrations, caused, by, delays, to, irish, home, rule, led, the, mps, of, sinn, f, in, a, pro, independence, party, that, had, won, a, majority, of, the, irish, seats, in, the, 1918, british, general, election, to, establish, an, independent, parliament, in, dublin, at, which, irish, independence, was, declared, the, irish, republican, army, simultaneously, began, a, guerrilla, war, against, the, british, administration, the, irish, war, of, independence, ended, in, 1921, with, a, stalemate, and, the, signing, of, the, anglo, irish, treaty, creating, the, irish, free, state, a, dominion, within, the, british, empire, with, effective, internal, independence, but, still, constitutionally, linked, with, the, british, crown, northern, ireland, consisting, of, six, of, the, 32, irish, counties, which, had, been, established, as, a, devolved, region, under, the, 1920, government, of, ireland, act, immediately, exercised, its, option, under, the, treaty, to, retain, its, existing, status, within, the, united, kingdom, a, similar, struggle, began, in, india, when, the, government, of, india, act, 1919, failed, to, satisfy, the, demand, for, independence, concerns, over, communist, and, foreign, plots, following, the, ghadar, conspiracy, ensured, that, war, time, strictures, were, renewed, by, the, rowlatt, acts, this, led, to, tension, particularly, in, the, punjab, region, where, repressive, measures, culminated, in, the, amritsar, massacre, in, britain, public, opinion, was, divided, over, the, morality, of, the, massacre, between, those, who, saw, it, as, having, saved, india, from, anarchy, and, those, who, viewed, it, with, revulsion, the, non, cooperation, movement, was, called, off, in, march, 1922, following, the, chauri, chaura, incident, and, discontent, continued, to, simmer, for, the, next, 25, years, in, 1922, egypt, which, had, been, declared, a, british, protectorate, at, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, was, granted, formal, independence, though, it, continued, to, be, a, british, client, state, until, 1954, british, troops, remained, stationed, in, egypt, until, the, signing, of, the, anglo, egyptian, treaty, in, 1936, under, which, it, was, agreed, that, the, troops, would, withdraw, but, continue, to, occupy, and, defend, the, suez, canal, zone, in, return, egypt, was, assisted, in, joining, the, league, of, nations, iraq, a, british, mandate, since, 1920, gained, membership, of, the, league, in, its, own, right, after, achieving, independence, from, britain, in, 1932, in, palestine, britain, was, presented, with, the, problem, of, mediating, between, the, arabs, and, increasing, numbers, of, jews, the, balfour, declaration, which, had, been, incorporated, into, the, terms, of, the, mandate, stated, that, a, national, home, for, the, jewish, people, would, be, established, in, palestine, and, jewish, immigration, allowed, up, to, a, limit, that, would, be, determined, by, the, mandatory, power, this, led, to, increasing, conflict, with, the, arab, population, who, openly, revolted, in, 1936, as, the, threat, of, war, with, germany, increased, during, the, 1930s, britain, judged, the, support, of, arabs, as, more, important, than, the, establishment, of, a, jewish, homeland, and, shifted, to, a, pro, arab, stance, limiting, jewish, immigration, and, in, turn, triggering, a, jewish, insurgency, the, right, of, the, dominions, to, set, their, own, foreign, policy, independent, of, britain, was, recognised, at, the, 1923, imperial, conference, britain, s, request, for, military, assistance, from, the, dominions, at, the, outbreak, of, the, chanak, crisis, the, previous, year, had, been, turned, down, by, canada, and, south, africa, and, canada, had, refused, to, be, bound, by, the, 1923, treaty, of, lausanne, after, pressure, from, the, irish, free, state, and, south, africa, the, 1926, imperial, conference, issued, the, balfour, declaration, of, 1926, declaring, britain, and, the, dominions, to, be, autonomous, communities, within, the, british, empire, equal, in, status, in, no, way, subordinate, one, to, another, within, a, british, commonwealth, of, nations, this, declaration, was, given, legal, substance, under, the, 1931, statute, of, westminster, the, parliaments, of, canada, australia, new, zealand, the, union, of, south, africa, the, irish, free, state, and, newfoundland, were, now, independent, of, british, legislative, control, they, could, nullify, british, laws, and, britain, could, no, longer, pass, laws, for, them, without, their, consent, newfoundland, reverted, to, colonial, status, in, 1933, suffering, from, financial, difficulties, during, the, great, depression, in, 1937, the, irish, free, state, introduced, a, republican, constitution, renaming, itself, ireland, britain, s, declaration, of, war, against, nazi, germany, in, september, 1939, included, the, crown, colonies, and, india, but, did, not, automatically, commit, the, dominions, of, australia, canada, new, zealand, newfoundland, and, south, africa, all, soon, declared, war, on, germany, while, britain, continued, to, regard, ireland, as, still, within, the, british, commonwealth, ireland, chose, to, remain, legally, neutral, throughout, the, war, after, the, fall, of, france, in, june, 1940, britain, and, the, empire, stood, alone, against, germany, until, the, german, invasion, of, greece, on, 7, april, 1941, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, successfully, lobbied, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, for, military, aid, from, the, united, states, but, roosevelt, was, not, yet, ready, to, ask, congress, to, commit, the, country, to, war, in, august, 1941, churchill, and, roosevelt, met, and, signed, the, atlantic, charter, which, included, the, statement, that, the, rights, of, all, peoples, to, choose, the, form, of, government, under, which, they, live, should, be, respected, this, wording, was, ambiguous, as, to, whether, it, referred, to, european, countries, invaded, by, germany, and, italy, or, the, peoples, colonised, by, european, nations, and, would, later, be, interpreted, differently, by, the, british, americans, and, nationalist, movements, for, churchill, the, entry, of, the, united, states, into, the, war, was, the, greatest, joy, he, felt, that, britain, was, now, assured, of, victory, but, failed, to, recognise, that, the, many, disasters, immeasurable, costs, and, tribulations, lay, ahead, in, december, 1941, would, have, permanent, consequences, for, the, future, of, the, empire, the, manner, in, which, british, forces, were, rapidly, defeated, in, the, far, east, irreversibly, harmed, britain, s, standing, and, prestige, as, an, imperial, power, including, particularly, the, fall, of, singapore, which, had, previously, been, hailed, as, an, impregnable, fortress, and, the, eastern, equivalent, of, gibraltar, the, realisation, that, britain, could, not, defend, its, entire, empire, pushed, australia, and, new, zealand, which, now, appeared, threatened, by, japanese, forces, into, closer, ties, with, the, united, states, and, ultimately, the, 1951, anzus, pact, the, war, weakened, the, empire, in, other, ways, undermining, britain, s, control, of, politics, in, india, inflicting, long, term, economic, damage, and, irrevocably, changing, geopolitics, by, pushing, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, to, the, centre, of, the, global, stage, though, britain, and, the, empire, emerged, victorious, from, the, second, world, war, the, effects, of, the, conflict, were, profound, both, at, home, and, abroad, much, of, europe, a, continent, that, had, dominated, the, world, for, several, centuries, was, in, ruins, and, host, to, the, armies, of, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, who, now, held, the, balance, of, global, power, in, april, 1949, following, the, london, declaration, the, word, british, was, dropped, from, the, title, of, the, commonwealth, to, reflect, its, changing, nature, it, was, decided, that, the, term, commonwealth, country, should, formally, replace, dominion, for, official, commonwealth, usage, britain, was, left, essentially, bankrupt, with, insolvency, only, averted, in, 1946, after, the, negotiation, of, a, us, 3, 75, billion, loan, from, the, united, states, the, last, instalment, of, which, was, repaid, in, 2006, at, the, same, time, anti, colonial, movements, were, on, the, rise, in, the, colonies, of, european, nations, the, situation, was, complicated, further, by, the, increasing, cold, war, rivalry, of, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, in, principle, both, nations, were, opposed, to, european, colonialism, in, practice, american, anti, communism, prevailed, over, anti, imperialism, and, therefore, the, united, states, supported, the, continued, existence, of, the, british, empire, to, keep, communist, expansion, in, check, at, first, british, politicians, believed, it, would, be, possible, to, maintain, britain, s, role, as, a, world, power, at, the, head, of, a, re, imagined, commonwealth, but, by, 1960, they, were, forced, to, recognise, that, there, was, an, irresistible, wind, of, change, blowing, their, priorities, changed, to, maintaining, an, extensive, zone, of, british, influence, and, ensuring, that, stable, non, communist, governments, were, established, in, former, colonies, in, this, context, while, other, european, powers, such, as, france, and, portugal, waged, costly, and, unsuccessful, wars, to, keep, their, empires, intact, britain, generally, adopted, a, policy, of, peaceful, disengagement, from, its, colonies, although, violence, occurred, in, malaya, kenya, and, palestine, between, 1945, and, 1965, the, number, of, people, under, british, rule, outside, the, uk, itself, fell, from, 700, million, to, 5, million, 3, million, of, whom, were, in, hong, kong, the, pro, decolonisation, labour, government, elected, at, the, 1945, general, election, and, led, by, clement, attlee, moved, quickly, to, tackle, the, most, pressing, issue, facing, the, empire, indian, independence, india, s, two, major, political, parties, the, indian, national, congress, led, by, mahatma, gandhi, and, the, muslim, league, led, by, muhammad, ali, jinnah, had, been, campaigning, for, independence, for, decades, but, disagreed, as, to, how, it, should, be, implemented, congress, favoured, a, unified, secular, indian, state, whereas, the, league, fearing, domination, by, the, hindu, majority, desired, a, separate, islamic, state, for, muslim, majority, regions, increasing, civil, unrest, and, the, mutiny, of, the, royal, indian, navy, during, 1946, led, attlee, to, promise, independence, no, later, than, 30, june, 1948, when, the, urgency, of, the, situation, and, risk, of, civil, war, became, apparent, the, newly, appointed, and, last, viceroy, lord, mountbatten, hastily, brought, forward, the, date, to, 15, august, 1947, the, borders, drawn, by, the, british, to, broadly, partition, india, into, hindu, and, muslim, areas, left, tens, of, millions, as, minorities, in, the, newly, independent, states, of, india, and, pakistan, millions, of, muslims, crossed, from, india, to, pakistan, and, hindus, vice, versa, and, violence, between, the, two, communities, cost, hundreds, of, thousands, of, lives, burma, which, had, been, administered, as, part, of, british, india, until, 1937, and, sri, lanka, gained, their, independence, the, following, year, in, 1948, india, pakistan, and, sri, lanka, became, members, of, the, commonwealth, while, burma, chose, not, to, join, that, same, year, the, british, nationality, act, was, enacted, in, hopes, of, strengthening, and, unifying, the, commonwealth, it, provided, british, citizenship, and, right, of, entry, to, all, those, living, within, its, jurisdiction, the, british, mandate, in, palestine, where, an, arab, majority, lived, alongside, a, jewish, minority, presented, the, british, with, a, similar, problem, to, that, of, india, the, matter, was, complicated, by, large, numbers, of, jewish, refugees, seeking, to, be, admitted, to, palestine, following, the, holocaust, while, arabs, were, opposed, to, the, creation, of, a, jewish, state, frustrated, by, the, intractability, of, the, problem, attacks, by, jewish, paramilitary, organisations, and, the, increasing, cost, of, maintaining, its, military, presence, britain, announced, in, 1947, that, it, would, withdraw, in, 1948, and, leave, the, matter, to, the, united, nations, to, solve, the, un, general, assembly, subsequently, voted, for, a, plan, to, partition, palestine, into, a, jewish, and, an, arab, state, it, was, immediately, followed, by, the, outbreak, of, a, civil, war, between, the, arabs, and, jews, of, palestine, and, british, forces, withdrew, amid, the, fighting, the, british, mandate, for, palestine, officially, terminated, at, midnight, on, 15, may, 1948, as, the, state, of, israel, declared, independence, and, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, broke, out, during, which, the, territory, of, the, former, mandate, was, partitioned, between, israel, and, the, surrounding, arab, states, amid, the, fighting, british, forces, continued, to, withdraw, from, israel, with, the, last, british, troops, departing, from, haifa, on, 30, june, 1948, following, the, surrender, of, japan, in, the, second, world, war, anti, japanese, resistance, movements, in, malaya, turned, their, attention, towards, the, british, who, had, moved, to, quickly, retake, control, of, the, colony, valuing, it, as, a, source, of, rubber, and, tin, the, fact, that, the, guerrillas, were, primarily, malaysian, chinese, communists, meant, that, the, british, attempt, to, quell, the, uprising, was, supported, by, the, muslim, malay, majority, on, the, understanding, that, once, the, insurgency, had, been, quelled, independence, would, be, granted, the, malayan, emergency, as, it, was, called, began, in, 1948, and, lasted, until, 1960, but, by, 1957, britain, felt, confident, enough, to, grant, independence, to, the, federation, of, malaya, within, the, commonwealth, in, 1963, the, 11, states, of, the, federation, together, with, singapore, sarawak, and, north, borneo, joined, to, form, malaysia, but, in, 1965, chinese, majority, singapore, was, expelled, from, the, union, following, tensions, between, the, malay, and, chinese, populations, and, became, an, independent, city, state, brunei, which, had, been, a, british, protectorate, since, 1888, declined, to, join, the, union, in, the, 1951, general, election, the, conservative, party, returned, to, power, in, britain, under, the, leadership, of, winston, churchill, churchill, and, the, conservatives, believed, that, britain, s, position, as, a, world, power, relied, on, the, continued, existence, of, the, empire, with, the, base, at, the, suez, canal, allowing, britain, to, maintain, its, pre, eminent, position, in, the, middle, east, in, spite, of, the, loss, of, india, churchill, could, not, ignore, gamal, abdul, nasser, s, new, revolutionary, government, of, egypt, that, had, taken, power, in, 1952, and, the, following, year, it, was, agreed, that, british, troops, would, withdraw, from, the, suez, canal, zone, and, that, sudan, would, be, granted, self, determination, by, 1955, with, independence, to, follow, sudan, was, granted, independence, on, 1, january, 1956, in, july, 1956, nasser, unilaterally, nationalised, the, suez, canal, the, response, of, anthony, eden, who, had, succeeded, churchill, as, prime, minister, was, to, collude, with, france, to, engineer, an, israeli, attack, on, egypt, that, would, give, britain, and, france, an, excuse, to, intervene, militarily, and, retake, the, canal, eden, infuriated, us, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, by, his, lack, of, consultation, and, eisenhower, refused, to, back, the, invasion, another, of, eisenhower, s, concerns, was, the, possibility, of, a, wider, war, with, the, soviet, union, after, it, threatened, to, intervene, on, the, egyptian, side, eisenhower, applied, financial, leverage, by, threatening, to, sell, us, reserves, of, the, british, pound, and, thereby, precipitate, a, collapse, of, the, british, currency, though, the, invasion, force, was, militarily, successful, in, its, objectives, un, intervention, and, us, pressure, forced, britain, into, a, humiliating, withdrawal, of, its, forces, and, eden, resigned, the, suez, crisis, very, publicly, exposed, britain, s, limitations, to, the, world, and, confirmed, britain, s, decline, on, the, world, stage, and, its, end, as, a, first, rate, power, demonstrating, that, henceforth, it, could, no, longer, act, without, at, least, the, acquiescence, if, not, the, full, support, of, the, united, states, the, events, at, suez, wounded, british, national, pride, leading, one, member, of, parliament, mp, to, describe, it, as, britain, s, waterloo, and, another, to, suggest, that, the, country, had, become, an, american, satellite, margaret, thatcher, later, described, the, mindset, she, believed, had, befallen, britain, s, political, leaders, after, suez, where, they, went, from, believing, that, britain, could, do, anything, to, an, almost, neurotic, belief, that, britain, could, do, nothing, from, which, britain, did, not, recover, until, the, successful, recapture, of, the, falkland, islands, from, argentina, in, 1982, while, the, suez, crisis, caused, british, power, in, the, middle, east, to, weaken, it, did, not, collapse, britain, again, deployed, its, armed, forces, to, the, region, intervening, in, oman, 1957, jordan, 1958, and, kuwait, 1961, though, on, these, occasions, with, american, approval, as, the, new, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, s, foreign, policy, was, to, remain, firmly, aligned, with, the, united, states, although, britain, granted, kuwait, independence, in, 1961, it, continued, to, maintain, a, military, presence, in, the, middle, east, for, another, decade, on, 16, january, 1968, a, few, weeks, after, the, devaluation, of, the, pound, prime, minister, harold, wilson, and, his, defence, secretary, denis, healey, announced, that, british, armed, forces, troops, would, be, withdrawn, from, major, military, bases, east, of, suez, which, included, the, ones, in, the, middle, east, and, primarily, from, malaysia, and, singapore, by, the, end, of, 1971, instead, of, 1975, as, earlier, planned, by, that, time, over, 50, 000, british, military, personnel, were, still, stationed, in, the, far, east, including, 30, 000, in, singapore, the, british, granted, independence, to, the, maldives, in, 1965, but, continued, to, station, a, garrison, there, until, 1976, withdrew, from, aden, in, 1967, and, granted, independence, to, bahrain, qatar, and, the, united, arab, emirates, in, 1971, macmillan, gave, a, speech, in, cape, town, south, africa, in, february, 1960, where, he, spoke, of, the, wind, of, change, blowing, through, this, continent, macmillan, wished, to, avoid, the, same, kind, of, colonial, war, that, france, was, fighting, in, algeria, and, under, his, premiership, decolonisation, proceeded, rapidly, to, the, three, colonies, that, had, been, granted, independence, in, the, 1950s, sudan, the, gold, coast, and, malaya, were, added, nearly, ten, times, that, number, during, the, 1960s, owing, to, the, rapid, pace, of, decolonisation, during, this, period, the, cabinet, post, of, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, was, abolished, in, 1966, along, with, the, colonial, office, which, merged, with, the, commonwealth, relations, office, to, form, the, foreign, and, commonwealth, office, now, the, foreign, commonwealth, and, development, office, in, october, 1968, britain, s, remaining, colonies, in, africa, except, for, self, governing, southern, rhodesia, were, all, granted, independence, by, 1968, british, withdrawal, from, the, southern, and, eastern, parts, of, africa, was, not, a, peaceful, process, from, 1952, the, kenya, colony, saw, the, eight, year, long, mau, mau, rebellion, in, which, tens, of, thousands, of, suspected, rebels, were, interned, by, the, colonial, government, in, detention, camps, to, suppress, the, rebellion, and, over, 1000, convicts, executed, with, records, systematically, destroyed, throughout, the, 1960s, the, british, government, took, a, no, independence, until, majority, rule, policy, towards, decolonising, the, empire, leading, the, white, minority, government, of, southern, rhodesia, to, enact, the, 1965, unilateral, declaration, of, independence, from, britain, resulting, in, a, civil, war, that, lasted, until, the, british, mediated, lancaster, house, agreement, of, 1979, the, agreement, saw, the, british, empire, temporarily, re, establish, the, colony, of, southern, rhodesia, from, 1979, to, 1980, as, a, transitionary, government, to, a, majority, rule, republic, of, zimbabwe, this, was, the, last, british, possession, in, africa, in, cyprus, a, guerrilla, war, waged, by, the, greek, cypriot, organisation, eoka, against, british, rule, was, ended, in, 1959, by, the, london, and, z, rich, agreements, which, resulted, in, cyprus, being, granted, independence, in, 1960, the, uk, retained, the, military, bases, of, akrotiri, and, dhekelia, as, sovereign, base, areas, the, mediterranean, colony, of, malta, was, amicably, granted, independence, from, the, uk, in, 1964, and, became, the, country, of, malta, though, the, idea, had, been, raised, in, 1955, of, integration, with, britain, most, of, the, uk, s, caribbean, territories, achieved, independence, after, the, departure, in, 1961, and, 1962, of, jamaica, and, trinidad, from, the, west, indies, federation, established, in, 1958, in, an, attempt, to, unite, the, british, caribbean, colonies, under, one, government, but, which, collapsed, following, the, loss, of, its, two, largest, members, jamaica, attained, independence, in, 1962, as, did, trinidad, and, tobago, barbados, achieved, independence, in, 1966, and, the, remainder, of, the, eastern, caribbean, islands, including, the, bahamas, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, but, anguilla, and, the, turks, and, caicos, islands, opted, to, revert, to, british, rule, after, they, had, already, started, on, the, path, to, independence, the, british, virgin, islands, the, cayman, islands, and, montserrat, opted, to, retain, ties, with, britain, while, guyana, achieved, independence, in, 1966, britain, s, last, colony, on, the, american, mainland, british, honduras, became, a, self, governing, colony, in, 1964, and, was, renamed, belize, in, 1973, achieving, full, independence,

in, 1970, and, ending, with, vanuatu, in, 1980, vanuatu, s, independence, was, delayed, because, of, political, conflict, between, english, and, french, speaking, communities, as, the, islands, had, been, jointly, administered, as, a, condominium, with, france, fiji, papua, new, guinea, solomon, islands, and, tuvalu, became, commonwealth, realms, by, 1981, aside, from, a, scattering, of, islands, and, outposts, the, process, of, decolonisation, that, had, begun, after, the, second, world, war, was, largely, complete, in, 1982, britain, s, resolve, in, defending, its, remaining, overseas, territories, was, tested, when, argentina, invaded, the, falkland, islands, acting, on, a, long, standing, claim, that, dated, back, to, the, spanish, empire, britain, s, successful, military, response, to, retake, the, falkland, islands, during, the, ensuing, falklands, war, contributed, to, reversing, the, downward, trend, in, britain, s, status, as, a, world, power, the, 1980s, saw,
