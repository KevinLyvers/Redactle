a, mounded, accretion, due, to, long, term, human, settlement, of, a, very, large, neolithic, and, chalcolithic, proto, city, settlement, in, southern, anatolia, which, existed, from, approximately, 7500, bc, to, 6400, bc, and, flourished, around, 7000, bc, in, july, 2012, it, was, inscribed, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, atalh, y, k, overlooks, the, konya, plain, southeast, of, the, present, day, city, of, konya, ancient, iconium, in, turkey, approximately, 140, km, 87, mi, from, the, twin, coned, volcano, of, mount, hasan, the, eastern, settlement, forms, a, mound, that, would, have, risen, about, 20, m, 66, ft, above, the, plain, at, the, time, of, the, latest, neolithic, occupation, there, is, also, a, smaller, settlement, mound, to, the, west, and, a, byzantine, settlement, a, few, hundred, meters, to, the, east, the, prehistoric, mound, settlements, were, abandoned, before, the, bronze, age, a, channel, of, the, ar, amba, river, once, flowed, between, the, two, mounds, and, the, settlement, was, built, on, alluvial, clay, which, may, have, been, favorable, for, early, agriculture, currently, the, closest, river, is, the, euphrates, the, site, was, first, excavated, by, james, mellaart, in, 1958, he, later, led, a, team, which, further, excavated, there, for, four, seasons, between, 1961, and, 1965, these, excavations, revealed, this, section, of, anatolia, as, a, centre, of, advanced, culture, in, the, neolithic, period, excavation, revealed, 18, successive, layers, of, buildings, signifying, various, stages, of, the, settlement, and, eras, of, history, the, bottom, layer, of, buildings, can, be, dated, as, early, as, 7100, bc, while, the, top, layer, is, from, 5600, bc, mellaart, was, banned, from, turkey, for, his, involvement, in, the, dorak, affair, in, which, he, published, drawings, of, supposedly, important, bronze, age, artifacts, that, later, went, missing, after, this, scandal, the, site, lay, idle, until, 1993, when, investigations, began, under, the, leadership, of, ian, hodder, then, at, the, university, of, cambridge, the, hodder, led, excavations, ended, in, 2018, hodder, a, former, student, of, mellaart, chose, the, site, as, the, first, real, world, test, of, his, then, controversial, theory, of, post, processual, archaeology, the, site, has, always, had, a, strong, research, emphasis, upon, engagement, with, digital, methodologies, driven, by, the, project, s, experimental, and, reflexive, methodological, framework, according, to, mickel, hodder, s, atalh, y, k, research, project, rp, established, itself, as, a, site, for, progressive, methodologies, in, terms, of, adaptable, and, democratized, recording, integration, of, computerized, technologies, sampling, strategies, and, community, involvement, new, excavations, are, being, directed, by, ali, umut, t, rkcan, from, anadolu, university, atalh, y, k, was, composed, entirely, of, domestic, buildings, with, no, obvious, public, buildings, while, some, of, the, larger, rooms, have, rather, ornate, murals, the, purpose, of, others, remains, unclear, initial, estimates, suggested, an, average, population, of, between, 5, 000, and, 7, 000, however, more, recent, work, using, revised, information, on, residential, building, distribution, and, archaeological, and, ethnographic, data, estimate, between, 600, and, 800, people, in, an, average, year, lived, at, atalh, y, k, between, 6700, 6500, bc, the, sites, were, set, up, as, large, numbers, of, buildings, clustered, together, households, looked, to, their, neighbors, for, help, trade, and, possible, marriage, for, their, children, the, inhabitants, lived, in, mudbrick, houses, that, were, crammed, together, in, an, aggregate, structure, no, footpaths, or, streets, were, used, between, the, dwellings, which, were, clustered, in, a, honeycomb, like, maze, most, were, accessed, by, holes, in, the, ceiling, and, doors, on, the, side, of, the, houses, with, doors, reached, by, ladders, and, stairs, the, rooftops, were, effectively, streets, the, ceiling, openings, also, served, as, the, only, source, of, ventilation, allowing, smoke, from, the, houses, open, hearths, and, ovens, to, escape, houses, had, plaster, interiors, accessed, by, squared, off, timber, ladders, or, steep, stairs, these, were, usually, on, the, south, wall, of, the, room, as, were, cooking, hearths, and, ovens, the, main, rooms, contained, raised, platforms, that, may, have, been, used, for, a, range, of, domestic, activities, typical, houses, contained, two, rooms, for, everyday, activity, such, as, cooking, and, crafting, all, interior, walls, and, platforms, were, plastered, to, a, smooth, finish, ancillary, rooms, were, used, as, storage, and, were, accessed, through, low, openings, from, main, rooms, all, rooms, were, kept, scrupulously, clean, archaeologists, identified, very, little, rubbish, in, the, buildings, finding, middens, outside, the, ruins, with, sewage, and, food, waste, as, well, as, significant, amounts, of, ash, from, burning, wood, reeds, and, animal, dung, in, good, weather, many, daily, activities, may, also, have, taken, place, on, the, rooftops, which, may, have, formed, a, plaza, in, later, periods, large, communal, ovens, appear, to, have, been, built, on, these, rooftops, over, time, houses, were, renewed, by, partial, demolition, and, rebuilding, on, a, foundation, of, rubble, which, was, how, the, mound, was, gradually, built, up, as, many, as, eighteen, levels, of, settlement, have, been, uncovered, as, a, part, of, ritual, life, the, people, of, atalh, y, k, buried, their, dead, within, the, village, human, remains, have, been, found, in, pits, beneath, the, floors, and, especially, beneath, hearths, the, platforms, within, the, main, rooms, and, under, beds, bodies, were, tightly, flexed, before, burial, and, were, often, placed, in, baskets, or, wound, and, wrapped, in, reed, mats, disarticulated, bones, in, some, graves, suggest, that, bodies, may, have, been, exposed, in, the, open, air, for, a, time, before, the, bones, were, gathered, and, buried, in, some, cases, graves, were, disturbed, and, the, individual, s, head, removed, from, the, skeleton, these, heads, may, have, been, used, in, rituals, as, some, were, found, in, other, areas, of, the, community, in, a, woman, s, grave, spinning, whorls, were, recovered, and, in, a, man, s, grave, stone, axes, some, skulls, were, plastered, and, painted, with, ochre, to, recreate, faces, a, custom, more, characteristic, of, neolithic, sites, in, syria, and, neolithic, jericho, than, at, sites, closer, by, vivid, murals, and, figurines, are, found, throughout, the, settlement, on, interior, and, exterior, walls, distinctive, clay, figurines, of, women, notably, the, seated, woman, of, atalh, y, k, have, been, found, in, the, upper, levels, of, the, site, although, no, identifiable, temples, have, been, found, the, graves, murals, and, figurines, suggest, that, the, people, of, atalh, y, k, had, a, religion, rich, in, symbols, rooms, with, concentrations, of, these, items, may, have, been, shrines, or, public, meeting, areas, predominant, images, include, men, with, erect, phalluses, hunting, scenes, red, images, of, the, now, extinct, aurochs, wild, cattle, and, stags, and, vultures, swooping, down, on, headless, figures, relief, figures, are, carved, on, walls, such, as, of, lionesses, facing, one, another, heads, of, animals, especially, of, cattle, were, mounted, on, walls, a, painting, of, the, village, with, the, twin, mountain, peaks, of, hasan, da, in, the, background, is, frequently, cited, as, the, world, s, oldest, map, and, the, first, landscape, painting, however, some, archaeologists, question, this, interpretation, stephanie, meece, for, example, argues, that, it, is, more, likely, a, painting, of, a, leopard, skin, instead, of, a, volcano, and, a, decorative, geometric, design, instead, of, a, map, a, feature, of, atalh, y, k, are, its, female, figurines, mellaart, the, original, excavator, argued, that, these, carefully, made, figurines, carved, and, molded, from, marble, blue, and, brown, limestone, schist, calcite, basalt, alabaster, and, clay, represented, a, female, deity, although, a, male, deity, existed, as, well, statues, of, a, female, deity, far, outnumber, those, of, the, male, deity, who, moreover, does, not, appear, to, be, represented, at, all, after, level, vi, to, date, eighteen, levels, have, been, identified, these, figurines, were, found, primarily, in, areas, mellaart, believed, to, be, shrines, the, stately, goddess, seated, on, a, throne, flanked, by, two, lionesses, was, found, in, a, grain, bin, which, mellaart, suggests, might, have, been, a, means, of, ensuring, the, harvest, or, protecting, the, food, supply, whereas, mellaart, excavated, nearly, two, hundred, buildings, in, four, seasons, the, current, excavator, ian, hodder, spent, an, entire, season, excavating, one, building, alone, hodder, and, his, team, in, 2004, and, 2005, began, to, believe, that, the, patterns, suggested, by, mellaart, were, false, they, found, one, similar, figurine, but, the, vast, majority, did, not, imitate, the, mother, goddess, style, that, mellaart, suggested, instead, of, a, mother, goddess, culture, hodder, points, out, that, the, site, gives, little, indication, of, a, matriarchy, or, patriarchy, there, are, full, breasts, on, which, the, hands, rest, and, the, stomach, is, extended, in, the, central, part, there, is, a, hole, in, the, top, for, the, head, which, is, missing, as, one, turns, the, figurine, around, one, notices, that, the, arms, are, very, thin, and, then, on, the, back, of, the, figurine, one, sees, a, depiction, of, either, a, skeleton, or, the, bones, of, a, very, thin, and, depleted, human, the, ribs, and, vertebrae, are, clear, as, are, the, scapulae, and, the, main, pelvic, bones, the, figurine, can, be, interpreted, in, a, number, of, ways, as, a, woman, turning, into, an, ancestor, as, a, woman, associated, with, death, or, as, death, and, life, conjoined, it, is, possible, that, the, lines, around, the, body, represent, wrapping, rather, than, ribs, whatever, the, specific, interpretation, this, is, a, unique, piece, that, may, force, us, to, change, our, views, of, the, nature, of, atalh, y, k, society, and, imagery, perhaps, the, importance, of, female, imagery, was, related, to, some, special, role, of, the, female, in, relation, to, death, as, much, as, to, the, roles, of, mother, and, nurturer, in, an, article, in, the, turkish, daily, news, hodder, is, reported, as, denying, that, atalh, y, k, was, a, matriarchal, society, and, quoted, as, saying, when, we, look, at, what, they, eat, and, drink, and, at, their, social, statues, we, see, that, men, and, women, had, the, same, social, status, there, was, a, balance, of, power, another, example, is, the, skulls, found, if, one, s, social, status, was, of, high, importance, in, atalh, y, k, the, body, and, head, were, separated, after, death, the, number, of, female, and, male, skulls, found, during, the, excavations, is, almost, equal, in, another, article, in, the, hurriyet, daily, news, hodder, is, reported, to, say, we, have, learned, that, men, and, women, were, equally, approached, in, a, report, in, september, 2009, on, the, discovery, of, around, 2000, figurines, hodder, is, quoted, as, saying, atalh, y, k, was, excavated, in, the, 1960s, in, a, methodical, way, but, not, using, the, full, range, of, natural, science, techniques, that, are, available, to, us, today, sir, james, mellaart, who, excavated, the, site, in, the, 1960s, came, up, with, all, sorts, of, ideas, about, the, way, the, site, was, organized, and, how, it, was, lived, in, and, so, on, we, ve, now, started, working, there, since, the, mid, 1990s, and, come, up, with, very, different, ideas, about, the, site, one, of, the, most, obvious, examples, of, that, is, that, atalh, y, k, is, perhaps, best, known, for, the, idea, of, the, mother, goddess, but, our, work, more, recently, has, tended, to, show, that, in, fact, there, is, very, little, evidence, of, a, mother, goddess, and, very, little, evidence, of, some, sort, of, female, based, matriarchy, that, s, just, one, of, the, many, myths, that, the, modern, scientific, work, is, undermining, professor, lynn, meskell, explained, that, while, the, original, excavations, had, found, only, 200, figures, the, new, excavations, had, uncovered, 2, 000, figures, most, of, which, depicted, animals, and, fewer, than, 5, of, the, figurines, depicted, women, estonian, folklorist, uku, masing, has, suggested, as, early, as, in, 1976, that, atalh, y, k, was, probably, a, hunting, and, gathering, religion, and, the, mother, goddess, figurine, did, not, represent, a, female, deity, he, implied, that, perhaps, a, longer, period, of, time, was, needed, to, develop, symbols, for, agricultural, rites, his, theory, was, developed, in, the, paper, some, remarks, on, the, mythology, of, the, people, of, catal, h, y, k, atalh, y, k, has, strong, evidence, of, an, egalitarian, society, as, no, houses, with, distinctive, features, belonging, to, royalty, or, religious, hierarchy, for, example, have, been, found, so, far, the, most, recent, investigations, also, reveal, little, social, distinction, based, on, gender, with, men, and, women, receiving, equivalent, nutrition, and, seeming, to, have, equal, social, status, as, typically, found, in, paleolithic, cultures, children, observed, domestic, areas, they, learned, how, to, perform, rituals, and, how, to, build, or, repair, houses, by, watching, the, adults, make, statues, beads, and, other, objects, atalh, y, k, s, spatial, layout, may, be, due, to, the, close, kin, relations, exhibited, amongst, the, people, it, can, be, seen, in, the, layout, that, the, people, were, divided, into, two, groups, who, lived, on, opposite, sides, of, the, town, separated, by, a, gully, furthermore, because, no, nearby, towns, were, found, from, which, marriage, partners, could, be, drawn, this, spatial, separation, must, have, marked, two, intermarrying, kinship, groups, this, would, help, explain, how, a, settlement, so, early, on, would, become, so, large, in, the, upper, levels, of, the, site, it, becomes, apparent, that, the, people, of, atalh, y, k, were, honing, skills, in, agriculture, and, the, domestication, of, animals, female, figurines, have, been, found, within, bins, used, for, storage, of, cereals, such, as, wheat, and, barley, and, the, figurines, are, presumed, to, be, of, a, deity, protecting, the, grain, peas, were, also, grown, and, almonds, pistachios, and, fruit, were, harvested, from, trees, in, the, surrounding, hills, sheep, were, domesticated, and, evidence, suggests, the, beginning, of, cattle, domestication, as, well, however, hunting, continued, to, be, a, major, source, of, food, for, the, community, pottery, and, obsidian, tools, appear, to, have, been, major, industries, obsidian, tools, were, probably, both, used, and, also, traded, for, items, such, as, mediterranean, sea, shells, and, flint, from, syria, noting, the, lack, of, hierarchy, and, economic, inequality, historian, and, anti, capitalist, author, murray, bookchin, has, argued, that, atalh, y, k, was, an, early, example, of, anarcho, communism, conversely, a, 2014, paper, argues, that, the, picture, of, atalh, y, k, is, more, complex, and, that, while, there, seemed, to, have, been, an, egalitarian, distribution, of, cooking, tools, and, some, stone, tools, unbroken, quern, stones, and, storage, units, were, more, unevenly, distributed, private, property, existed, but, shared, tools, also, existed, it, was, also, suggested, that, atalh, y, k, was, becoming, less, egalitarian, with, greater, inter, generational, wealth, transmission
