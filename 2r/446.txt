the, information, age, also, known, as, the, third, industrial, revolution, computer, age, digital, age, silicon, age, new, media, age, internet, age, or, the, digital, revolution, is, a, historical, period, that, began, in, the, mid, 20th, century, it, is, characterized, by, a, rapid, shift, from, traditional, industries, as, established, during, the, industrial, revolution, to, an, economy, centered, on, information, technology, the, onset, of, the, information, age, has, been, linked, to, the, development, of, the, transistor, in, 1947, and, the, optical, amplifier, in, 1957, these, technological, advances, have, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, way, information, is, processed, and, transmitted, according, to, the, united, nations, public, administration, network, the, information, age, was, formed, by, capitalizing, on, computer, microminiaturization, advances, which, led, to, modernized, information, systems, and, internet, communications, as, the, driving, force, of, social, evolution, many, debate, if, or, when, the, third, industrial, revolution, ended, and, the, fourth, industrial, revolution, began, ranging, from, 2000, to, 2020, the, digital, revolution, converted, technology, from, analog, format, to, digital, format, by, doing, this, it, became, possible, to, make, copies, that, were, identical, to, the, original, in, digital, communications, for, example, repeating, hardware, was, able, to, amplify, the, digital, signal, and, pass, it, on, with, no, loss, of, information, in, the, signal, of, equal, importance, to, the, revolution, was, the, ability, to, easily, move, the, digital, information, between, media, and, to, access, or, distribute, it, remotely, one, turning, point, of, the, revolution, was, the, change, from, analog, to, digitally, recorded, music, during, the, 1980s, the, digital, format, of, optical, compact, discs, gradually, replaced, analog, formats, such, as, vinyl, records, and, cassette, tapes, as, the, popular, medium, of, choice, humans, have, manufactured, tools, for, counting, and, calculating, since, ancient, times, such, as, the, abacus, astrolabe, equatorium, and, mechanical, timekeeping, devices, more, complicated, devices, started, appearing, in, the, 1600s, including, the, slide, rule, and, mechanical, calculators, by, the, early, 1800s, the, industrial, revolution, had, produced, mass, market, calculators, like, the, arithmometer, and, the, enabling, technology, of, the, punch, card, charles, babbage, proposed, a, mechanical, general, purpose, computer, called, the, analytical, engine, but, it, was, never, successfully, built, and, was, largely, forgotten, by, the, 20th, century, and, unknown, to, most, of, the, inventors, of, modern, computers, the, second, industrial, revolution, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, developed, useful, electrical, circuits, and, the, telegraph, in, the, 1880s, herman, hollerith, developed, electromechanical, tabulating, and, calculating, devices, using, punch, cards, and, unit, record, equipment, which, became, widespread, in, business, and, government, meanwhile, various, analog, computer, systems, used, electrical, mechanical, or, hydraulic, systems, to, model, problems, and, calculate, answers, these, included, an, 1872, tide, predicting, machine, differential, analysers, perpetual, calendar, machines, the, deltar, for, water, management, in, the, netherlands, network, analyzers, for, electrical, systems, and, various, machines, for, aiming, military, guns, and, bombs, the, construction, of, problem, specific, analog, computers, continued, in, the, late, 1940s, and, beyond, with, fermiac, for, neutron, transport, project, cyclone, for, various, military, applications, and, the, phillips, machine, for, economic, modeling, building, on, the, complexity, of, the, z1, and, z2, german, inventor, konrad, zuse, used, electromechanical, systems, to, complete, in, 1941, the, z3, the, world, s, first, working, programmable, fully, automatic, digital, computer, also, during, world, war, ii, allied, engineers, constructed, electromechanical, bombes, to, break, german, enigma, machine, encoding, the, base, 10, electromechanical, harvard, mark, i, was, completed, in, 1944, and, was, to, some, degree, improved, with, inspiration, from, charles, babbage, s, designs, in, 1947, the, first, working, transistor, the, germanium, based, point, contact, transistor, was, invented, by, john, bardeen, and, walter, houser, brattain, while, working, under, william, shockley, at, bell, labs, this, led, the, way, to, more, advanced, digital, computers, from, the, late, 1940s, universities, military, and, businesses, developed, computer, systems, to, digitally, replicate, and, automate, previously, manually, performed, mathematical, calculations, with, the, leo, being, the, first, commercially, available, general, purpose, computer, digital, communication, became, economical, for, widespread, adoption, after, the, invention, of, the, personal, computer, in, the, 1970s, claude, shannon, a, bell, labs, mathematician, is, credited, for, having, laid, out, the, foundations, of, digitalization, in, his, pioneering, 1948, article, a, mathematical, theory, of, communication, other, important, technological, developments, included, the, invention, of, the, monolithic, integrated, circuit, chip, by, robert, noyce, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1959, made, possible, by, the, planar, process, developed, by, jean, hoerni, the, first, successful, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, or, mos, transistor, by, mohamed, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, at, bell, labs, in, 1959, and, the, development, of, the, complementary, mos, cmos, process, by, frank, wanlass, and, chih, tang, sah, at, fairchild, in, 1963, in, 1962, at, t, deployed, the, t, carrier, for, long, haul, pulse, code, modulation, pcm, digital, voice, transmission, the, t1, format, carried, 24, pulse, code, modulated, time, division, multiplexed, speech, signals, each, encoded, in, 64, kbit, s, streams, leaving, 8, kbit, s, of, framing, information, which, facilitated, the, synchronization, and, demultiplexing, at, the, receiver, over, the, subsequent, decades, the, digitisation, of, voice, became, the, norm, for, all, but, the, last, mile, where, analogue, continued, to, be, the, norm, right, into, the, late, 1990s, following, the, development, of, mos, integrated, circuit, chips, in, the, early, 1960s, mos, chips, reached, higher, transistor, density, and, lower, manufacturing, costs, than, bipolar, integrated, circuits, by, 1964, mos, chips, further, increased, in, complexity, at, a, rate, predicted, by, moore, s, law, leading, to, large, scale, integration, lsi, with, hundreds, of, transistors, on, a, single, mos, chip, by, the, late, 1960s, the, application, of, mos, lsi, chips, to, computing, was, the, basis, for, the, first, microprocessors, as, engineers, began, recognizing, that, a, complete, computer, processor, could, be, contained, on, a, single, mos, lsi, chip, in, 1968, fairchild, engineer, federico, faggin, improved, mos, technology, with, his, development, of, the, silicon, gate, mos, chip, which, he, later, used, to, develop, the, intel, 4004, the, first, single, chip, microprocessor, it, was, released, by, intel, in, 1971, and, laid, the, foundations, for, the, microcomputer, revolution, that, began, in, the, 1970s, mos, technology, also, led, to, the, development, of, semiconductor, image, sensors, suitable, for, digital, cameras, the, first, such, image, sensor, was, the, charge, coupled, device, developed, by, willard, s, boyle, and, george, e, smith, at, bell, labs, in, 1969, based, on, mos, capacitor, technology, the, public, was, first, introduced, to, the, concepts, that, led, to, the, internet, when, a, message, was, sent, over, the, arpanet, in, 1969, packet, switched, networks, such, as, arpanet, mark, i, cyclades, merit, network, tymnet, and, telenet, were, developed, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, using, a, variety, of, protocols, the, arpanet, in, particular, led, to, the, development, of, protocols, for, internetworking, in, which, multiple, separate, networks, could, be, joined, into, a, network, of, networks, the, whole, earth, movement, of, the, 1960s, advocated, the, use, of, new, technology, in, the, 1970s, the, home, computer, was, introduced, time, sharing, computers, the, video, game, console, the, first, coin, op, video, games, and, the, golden, age, of, arcade, video, games, began, with, space, invaders, as, digital, technology, proliferated, and, the, switch, from, analog, to, digital, record, keeping, became, the, new, standard, in, business, a, relatively, new, job, description, was, popularized, the, data, entry, clerk, culled, from, the, ranks, of, secretaries, and, typists, from, earlier, decades, the, data, entry, clerk, s, job, was, to, convert, analog, data, customer, records, invoices, etc, into, digital, data, in, developed, nations, computers, achieved, semi, ubiquity, during, the, 1980s, as, they, made, their, way, into, schools, homes, business, and, industry, automated, teller, machines, industrial, robots, cgi, in, film, and, television, electronic, music, bulletin, board, systems, and, video, games, all, fueled, what, became, the, zeitgeist, of, the, 1980s, millions, of, people, purchased, home, computers, making, household, names, of, early, personal, computer, manufacturers, such, as, apple, commodore, and, tandy, to, this, day, the, commodore, 64, is, often, cited, as, the, best, selling, computer, of, all, time, having, sold, 17, million, units, by, some, accounts, between, 1982, and, 1994, in, 1984, the, u, s, census, bureau, began, collecting, data, on, computer, and, internet, use, in, the, united, states, their, first, survey, showed, that, 8, 2, of, all, u, s, households, owned, a, personal, computer, in, 1984, and, that, households, with, children, under, the, age, of, 18, were, nearly, twice, as, likely, to, own, one, at, 15, 3, middle, and, upper, middle, class, households, were, the, most, likely, to, own, one, at, 22, 9, by, 1989, 15, of, all, u, s, households, owned, a, computer, and, nearly, 30, of, households, with, children, under, the, age, of, 18, owned, one, by, the, late, 1980s, many, businesses, were, dependent, on, computers, and, digital, technology, motorola, created, the, first, mobile, phone, motorola, dynatac, in, 1983, however, this, device, used, analog, communication, digital, cell, phones, were, not, sold, commercially, until, 1991, when, the, 2g, network, started, to, be, opened, in, finland, to, accommodate, the, unexpected, demand, for, cell, phones, that, was, becoming, apparent, in, the, late, 1980s, compute, magazine, predicted, that, cd, rom, would, be, the, centerpiece, of, the, revolution, with, multiple, household, devices, reading, the, discs, the, first, true, digital, camera, was, created, in, 1988, and, the, first, were, marketed, in, december, 1989, in, japan, and, in, 1990, in, the, united, states, by, the, early, 2000s, digital, cameras, had, eclipsed, traditional, film, in, popularity, digital, ink, and, paint, was, also, invented, in, the, late, 1980s, disney, s, caps, system, created, 1988, was, used, for, a, scene, in, 1989, s, the, little, mermaid, and, for, all, their, animation, films, between, 1990, s, the, rescuers, down, under, and, 2004, s, home, on, the, range, tim, berners, lee, invented, the, world, wide, web, in, 1989, the, first, public, digital, hdtv, broadcast, was, of, the, 1990, world, cup, that, june, it, was, played, in, 10, theaters, in, spain, and, italy, however, hdtv, did, not, become, a, standard, until, the, mid, 2000s, outside, japan, the, world, wide, web, became, publicly, accessible, in, 1991, which, had, been, available, only, to, government, and, universities, in, 1993, marc, andreessen, and, eric, bina, introduced, mosaic, the, first, web, browser, capable, of, displaying, inline, images, and, the, basis, for, later, browsers, such, as, netscape, navigator, and, internet, explorer, stanford, federal, credit, union, was, the, first, financial, institution, to, offer, online, internet, banking, services, to, all, of, its, members, in, october, 1994, in, 1996, op, financial, group, also, a, cooperative, bank, became, the, second, online, bank, in, the, world, and, the, first, in, europe, the, internet, expanded, quickly, and, by, 1996, it, was, part, of, mass, culture, and, many, businesses, listed, websites, in, their, ads, by, 1999, almost, every, country, had, a, connection, and, nearly, half, of, americans, and, people, in, several, other, countries, used, the, internet, on, a, regular, basis, however, throughout, the, 1990s, getting, online, entailed, complicated, configuration, and, dial, up, was, the, only, connection, type, affordable, by, individual, users, the, present, day, mass, internet, culture, was, not, possible, in, 1989, about, 15, of, all, households, in, the, united, states, owned, a, personal, computer, for, households, with, children, nearly, 30, owned, a, computer, in, 1989, and, in, 2000, 65, owned, one, cell, phones, became, as, ubiquitous, as, computers, by, the, early, 2000s, with, movie, theaters, beginning, to, show, ads, telling, people, to, silence, their, phones, they, also, became, much, more, advanced, than, phones, of, the, 1990s, most, of, which, only, took, calls, or, at, most, allowed, for, the, playing, of, simple, games, text, messaging, became, widely, used, in, the, late, 1990s, worldwide, except, for, in, the, united, states, of, america, where, text, messaging, didn, t, become, commonplace, till, the, early, 2000s, the, digital, revolution, became, truly, global, in, this, time, as, well, after, revolutionizing, society, in, the, developed, world, in, the, 1990s, the, digital, revolution, spread, to, the, masses, in, the, developing, world, in, the, 2000s, by, 2000, a, majority, of, u, s, households, had, at, least, one, personal, computer, and, internet, access, the, following, year, in, 2002, a, majority, of, u, s, survey, respondents, reported, having, a, mobile, phone, in, late, 2005, the, population, of, the, internet, reached, 1, billion, and, 3, billion, people, worldwide, used, cell, phones, by, the, end, of, the, decade, hdtv, became, the, standard, television, broadcasting, format, in, many, countries, by, the, end, of, the, decade, in, september, and, december, 2006, respectively, luxembourg, and, the, netherlands, became, the, first, countries, to, completely, transition, from, analog, to, digital, television, in, september, 2007, a, majority, of, u, s, survey, respondents, reported, having, broadband, internet, at, home, according, to, estimates, from, the, nielsen, media, research, approximately, 45, 7, million, u, s, households, in, 2006, or, approximately, 40, percent, of, approximately, 114, 4, million, owned, a, dedicated, home, video, game, console, and, by, 2015, 51, percent, of, u, s, households, owned, a, dedicated, home, video, game, console, according, to, an, entertainment, software, association, annual, industry, report, by, 2012, over, 2, billion, people, used, the, internet, twice, the, number, using, it, in, 2007, cloud, computing, had, entered, the, mainstream, by, the, early, 2010s, in, january, 2013, a, majority, of, u, s, survey, respondents, reported, owning, a, smartphone, by, 2016, half, of, the, world, s, population, was, connected, and, as, of, 2020, that, number, has, risen, to, 67, in, the, late, 1980s, less, than, 1, of, the, world, s, technologically, stored, information, was, in, digital, format, while, it, was, 94, in, 2007, with, more, than, 99, by, 2014, it, is, estimated, that, the, world, s, capacity, to, store, information, has, increased, from, 2, 6, optimally, compressed, exabytes, in, 1986, to, some, 5, 000, exabytes, in, 2014, 5, zettabytes, library, expansion, was, calculated, in, 1945, by, fremont, rider, to, double, in, capacity, every, 16, years, where, sufficient, space, made, available, he, advocated, replacing, bulky, decaying, printed, works, with, miniaturized, microform, analog, photographs, which, could, be, duplicated, on, demand, for, library, patrons, and, other, institutions, rider, did, not, foresee, however, the, digital, technology, that, would, follow, decades, later, to, replace, analog, microform, with, digital, imaging, storage, and, transmission, media, whereby, vast, increases, in, the, rapidity, of, information, growth, would, be, made, possible, through, automated, potentially, lossless, digital, technologies, accordingly, moore, s, law, formulated, around, 1965, would, calculate, that, the, number, of, transistors, in, a, dense, integrated, circuit, doubles, approximately, every, two, years, by, the, early, 1980s, along, with, improvements, in, computing, power, the, proliferation, of, the, smaller, and, less, expensive, personal, computers, allowed, for, immediate, access, to, information, and, the, ability, to, share, and, store, it, connectivity, between, computers, within, organizations, enabled, access, to, greater, amounts, of, information, the, world, s, technological, capacity, to, store, information, grew, from, 2, 6, optimally, compressed, exabytes, eb, in, 1986, to, 15, 8, eb, in, 1993, over, 54, 5, eb, in, 2000, and, to, 295, optimally, compressed, eb, in, 2007, this, is, the, informational, equivalent, to, less, than, one, 730, megabyte, mb, cd, rom, per, person, in, 1986, 539, mb, per, person, roughly, four, cd, rom, per, person, in, 1993, twelve, cd, rom, per, person, in, the, year, 2000, and, almost, sixty, one, cd, rom, per, person, in, 2007, it, is, estimated, that, the, world, s, capacity, to, store, information, has, reached, 5, zettabytes, in, 2014, the, informational, equivalent, of, 4, 500, stacks, of, printed, books, from, the, earth, to, the, sun, the, amount, of, digital, data, stored, appears, to, be, growing, approximately, exponentially, reminiscent, of, moore, s, law, as, such, kryder, s, law, prescribes, that, the, amount, of, storage, space, available, appears, to, be, growing, approximately, exponentially, the, world, s, technological, capacity, to, receive, information, through, one, way, broadcast, networks, was, 432, exabytes, of, optimally, compressed, information, in, 1986, 715, optimally, compressed, exabytes, in, 1993, 1, 2, optimally, compressed, zettabytes, in, 2000, and, 1, 9, zettabytes, in, 2007, the, information, equivalent, of, 174, newspapers, per, person, per, day, the, world, s, effective, capacity, to, exchange, information, through, two, way, telecommunication, networks, was, 281, petabytes, of, optimally, compressed, information, in, 1986, 471, petabytes, in, 1993, 2, 2, optimally, compressed, exabytes, in, 2000, and, 65, optimally, compressed, exabytes, in, 2007, the, information, equivalent, of, six, newspapers, per, person, per, day, in, the, 1990s, the, spread, of, the, internet, caused, a, sudden, leap, in, access, to, and, ability, to, share, information, in, businesses, and, homes, globally, a, computer, that, cost, 3000, in, 1997, would, cost, 2000, two, years, later, and, 1000, the, following, year, due, to, the, rapid, advancement, of, technology, the, world, s, technological, capacity, to, compute, information, with, human, guided, general, purpose, computers, grew, from, 3, 0, 10, 8, mips, in, 1986, to, 4, 4, 10, 9, mips, in, 1993, to, 2, 9, 10, 11, mips, in, 2000, to, 6, 4, 10, 12, mips, in, 2007, an, article, featured, in, the, journal, trends, in, ecology, and, evolution, in, 2016, reported, that, digital, technology, has, vastly, exceeded, the, cognitive, capacity, of, any, single, human, being, and, has, done, so, a, decade, earlier, than, predicted, in, terms, of, capacity, there, are, two, measures, of, importance, the, number, of, operations, a, system, can, perform, and, the, amount, of, information, that, can, be, stored, the, number, of, synaptic, operations, per, second, in, a, human, brain, has, been, estimated, to, lie, between, 10, 15, and, 10, 17, while, this, number, is, impressive, even, in, 2007, humanity, s, general, purpose, computers, were, capable, of, performing, well, over, 10, 18, instructions, per, second, estimates, suggest, that, the, storage, capacity, of, an, individual, human, brain, is, about, 10, 12, bytes, on, a, per, capita, basis, this, is, matched, by, current, digital, storage, 5x10, 21, bytes, per, 7, 2x10, 9, people, genetic, code, may, also, be, considered, part, of, the, information, revolution, now, that, sequencing, has, been, computerized, genome, can, be, rendered, and, manipulated, as, data, this, started, with, dna, sequencing, invented, by, walter, gilbert, and, allan, maxam, in, 1976, 1977, and, frederick, sanger, in, 1977, grew, steadily, with, the, human, genome, project, initially, conceived, by, gilbert, and, finally, the, practical, applications, of, sequencing, such, as, gene, testing, after, the, discovery, by, myriad, genetics, of, the, brca1, breast, cancer, gene, mutation, sequence, data, in, genbank, has, grown, from, the, 606, genome, sequences, registered, in, december, 1982, to, the, 231, million, genomes, in, august, 2021, an, additional, 13, trillion, incomplete, sequences, are, registered, in, the, whole, genome, shotgun, submission, database, as, of, august, 2021, the, information, contained, in, these, registered, sequences, has, doubled, every, 18, months, during, rare, times, in, human, history, there, have, been, periods, of, innovation, that, have, transformed, human, life, the, neolithic, age, the, scientific, age, and, the, industrial, age, all, ultimately, induced, discontinuous, and, irreversible, changes, in, the, economic, social, and, cultural, elements, of, the, daily, life, of, most, people, traditionally, these, epochs, have, taken, place, over, hundreds, or, in, the, case, of, the, neolithic, revolution, thousands, of, years, whereas, the, information, age, swept, to, all, parts, of, the, globe, in, just, a, few, years, as, a, result, of, the, rapidly, advancing, speed, of, information, exchange, between, 7, 000, and, 10, 000, years, ago, during, the, neolithic, period, humans, began, to, domesticate, animals, began, to, farm, grains, and, to, replace, stone, tools, with, ones, made, of, metal, these, innovations, allowed, nomadic, hunter, gatherers, to, settle, down, villages, formed, along, the, yangtze, river, in, china, in, 6, 500, b, c, the, nile, river, region, of, africa, and, in, mesopotamia, iraq, in, 6, 000, b, c, cities, emerged, between, 6, 000, b, c, and, 3, 500, b, c, the, development, of, written, communication, cuneiform, in, sumeria, and, hieroglyphs, in, egypt, in, 3, 500, b, c, and, writing, in, egypt, in, 2, 560, b, c, and, in, minoa, and, china, around, 1, 450, b, c, enabled, ideas, to, be, preserved, for, extended, periods, to, spread, extensively, in, all, neolithic, developments, augmented, by, writing, as, an, information, tool, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, advent, of, civilization, the, scientific, age, began, in, the, period, between, galileo, s, 1543, proof, that, the, planets, orbit, the, sun, and, newton, s, publication, of, the, laws, of, motion, and, gravity, in, principia, in, 1697, this, age, of, discovery, continued, through, the, 18th, century, accelerated, by, widespread, use, of, the, moveable, type, printing, press, by, johannes, gutenberg, the, industrial, age, began, in, great, britain, in, 1760, and, continued, into, the, mid, 19th, century, the, invention, of, machines, such, as, the, mechanical, textile, weaver, by, edmund, cartwrite, the, rotating, shaft, steam, engine, by, james, watt, and, the, cotton, gin, by, eli, whitney, along, with, processes, for, mass, manufacturing, came, to, serve, the, needs, of, a, growing, global, population, the, industrial, age, harnessed, steam, and, waterpower, to, reduce, the, dependence, on, animal, and, human, physical, labor, as, the, primary, means, of, production, thus, the, core, of, the, industrial, revolution, was, the, generation, and, distribution, of, energy, from, coal, and, water, to, produce, steam, and, later, in, the, 20th, century, electricity, the, information, age, also, requires, electricity, to, power, the, global, networks, of, computers, that, process, and, store, data, however, what, dramatically, accelerated, the, pace, of, the, information, age, s, adoption, as, compared, to, previous, ones, was, the, speed, by, which, knowledge, could, be, transferred, and, pervaded, the, entire, human, family, in, a, few, short, decades, this, acceleration, came, about, with, the, adoptions, of, a, new, form, of, power, beginning, in, 1972, engineers, devised, ways, to, harness, light, to, convey, data, through, fiber, optic, cable, today, light, based, optical, networking, systems, at, the, heart, of, telecom, networks, and, the, internet, span, the, globe, and, carry, most, of, the, information, traffic, to, and, from, users, and, data, storage, systems, there, are, different, conceptualizations, of, the, information, age, some, focus, on, the, evolution, of, information, over, the, ages, distinguishing, between, the, primary, information, age, and, the, secondary, information, age, information, in, the, primary, information, age, was, handled, by, newspapers, radio, and, television, the, secondary, information, age, was, developed, by, the, internet, satellite, televisions, and, mobile, phones, the, tertiary, information, age, was, emerged, by, media, of, the, primary, information, age, interconnected, with, media, of, the, secondary, information, age, as, presently, experienced, others, classify, it, in, terms, of, the, well, established, schumpeterian, long, waves, or, kondratiev, waves, here, authors, distinguish, three, different, long, term, meta, paradigms, each, with, different, long, waves, the, first, focused, on, the, transformation, of, material, including, stone, bronze, and, iron, the, second, often, referred, to, as, industrial, revolution, was, dedicated, to, the, transformation, of, energy, including, water, steam, electric, and, combustion, power, finally, the, most, recent, metaparadigm, aims, at, transforming, information, it, started, out, with, the, proliferation, of, communication, and, stored, data, and, has, now, entered, the, age, of, algorithms, which, aims, at, creating, automated, processes, to, convert, the, existing, information, into, actionable, knowledge, the, main, feature, of, the, information, revolution, is, the, growing, economic, social, and, technological, role, of, information, information, related, activities, did, not, come, up, with, the, information, revolution, they, existed, in, one, form, or, the, other, in, all, human, societies, and, eventually, developed, into, institutions, such, as, the, platonic, academy, aristotle, s, peripatetic, school, in, the, lyceum, the, musaeum, and, the, library, of, alexandria, or, the, schools, of, babylonian, astronomy, the, agricultural, revolution, and, the, industrial, revolution, came, up, when, new, informational, inputs, were, produced, by, individual, innovators, or, by, scientific, and, technical, institutions, during, the, information, revolution, all, these, activities, are, experiencing, continuous, growth, while, other, information, oriented, activities, are, emerging, information, is, the, central, theme, of, several, new, sciences, which, emerged, in, the, 1940s, including, shannon, s, 1949, information, theory, and, wiener, s, 1948, cybernetics, wiener, stated, information, is, information, not, matter, or, energy, this, aphorism, suggests, that, information, should, be, considered, along, with, matter, and, energy, as, the, third, constituent, part, of, the, universe, information, is, carried, by, matter, or, by, energy, by, the, 1990s, some, writers, believed, that, changes, implied, by, the, information, revolution, will, lead, to, not, only, a, fiscal, crisis, for, governments, but, also, the, disintegration, of, all, large, structures, the, term, information, revolution, may, relate, to, or, contrast, with, such, widely, used, terms, as, industrial, revolution, and, agricultural, revolution, note, however, that, you, may, prefer, mentalist, to, materialist, paradigm, the, following, fundamental, aspects, of, the, theory, of, information, revolution, can, be, given, from, a, different, perspective, irving, e, fang, 1997, identified, six, information, revolutions, writing, printing, mass, media, entertainment, the, tool, shed, which, we, call, home, now, and, the, information, highway, in, this, work, the, term, information, revolution, is, used, in, a, narrow, sense, to, describe, trends, in, communication, media, porat, 1976, measured, the, information, sector, in, the, us, using, the, input, output, analysis, oecd, has, included, statistics, on, the, information, sector, in, the, economic, reports, of, its, member, countries, veneris, 1984, 1990, explored, the, theoretical, economic, and, regional, aspects, of, the, informational, revolution, and, developed, a, systems, dynamics, simulation, computer, model, these, works, can, be, seen, as, following, the, path, originated, with, the, work, of, fritz, machlup, who, in, his, 1962, book, the, production, and, distribution, of, knowledge, in, the, united, states, claimed, that, the, knowledge, industry, represented, 29, of, the, us, gross, national, product, which, he, saw, as, evidence, that, the, information, age, had, begun, he, defines, knowledge, as, a, commodity, and, attempts, to, measure, the, magnitude, of, the, production, and, distribution, of, this, commodity, within, a, modern, economy, machlup, divided, information, use, into, three, classes, instrumental, intellectual, and, pastime, knowledge, he, identified, also, five, types, of, knowledge, practical, knowledge, intellectual, knowledge, that, is, general, culture, and, the, satisfying, of, intellectual, curiosity, pastime, knowledge, that, is, knowledge, satisfying, non, intellectual, curiosity, or, the, desire, for, light, entertainment, and, emotional, stimulation, spiritual, or, religious, knowledge, unwanted, knowledge, accidentally, acquired, and, aimlessly, retained, more, recent, estimates, have, reached, the, following, results, eventually, information, and, communication, technology, ict, i, e, computers, computerized, machinery, fiber, optics, communication, satellites, the, internet, and, other, ict, tools, became, a, significant, part, of, the, world, economy, as, the, development, of, optical, networking, and, microcomputers, greatly, changed, many, businesses, and, industries, nicholas, negroponte, captured, the, essence, of, these, changes, in, his, 1995, book, being, digital, in, which, he, discusses, the, similarities, and, differences, between, products, made, of, atoms, and, products, made, of, bits, the, information, age, has, affected, the, workforce, in, several, ways, such, as, compelling, workers, to, compete, in, a, global, job, market, one, of, the, most, evident, concerns, is, the, replacement, of, human, labor, by, computers, that, can, do, their, jobs, faster, and, more, effectively, thus, creating, a, situation, in, which, individuals, who, perform, tasks, that, can, easily, be, automated, are, forced, to, find, employment, where, their, labor, is, not, as, disposable, this, especially, creates, issue, for, those, in, industrial, cities, where, solutions, typically, involve, lowering, working, time, which, is, often, highly, resisted, thus, individuals, who, lose, their, jobs, may, be, pressed, to, move, up, into, more, indispensable, professions, e, g, engineers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, professors, scientists, executives, journalists, consultants, who, are, able, to, compete, successfully, in, the, world, market, and, receive, relatively, high, wages, along, with, automation, jobs, traditionally, associated, with, the, middle, class, e, g, assembly, line, data, processing, management, and, supervision, have, also, begun, to, disappear, as, result, of, outsourcing, unable, to, compete, with, those, in, developing, countries, production, and, service, workers, in, post, industrial, i, e, developed, societies, either, lose, their, jobs, through, outsourcing, accept, wage, cuts, or, settle, for, low, skill, low, wage, service, jobs, in, the, past, the, economic, fate, of, individuals, would, be, tied, to, that, of, their, nation, s, for, example, workers, in, the, united, states, were, once, well, paid, in, comparison, to, those, in, other, countries, with, the, advent, of, the, information, age, and, improvements, in, communication, this, is, no, longer, the, case, as, workers, must, now, compete, in, a, global, job, market, whereby, wages, are, less, dependent, on, the, success, or, failure, of, individual, economies, in, effectuating, a, globalized, workforce, the, internet, has, just, as, well, allowed, for, increased, opportunity, in, developing, countries, making, it, possible, for, workers, in, such, places, to, provide, in, person, services, therefore, competing, directly, with, their, counterparts, in, other, nations, this, competitive, advantage, translates, into, increased, opportunities, and, higher, wages, the, information, age, has, affected, the, workforce, in, that, automation, and, computerization, have, resulted, in, higher, productivity, coupled, with, net, job, loss, in, manufacturing, in, the, united, states, for, example, from, january, 1972, to, august, 2010, the, number, of, people, employed, in, manufacturing, jobs, fell, from, 17, 500, 000, to, 11, 500, 000, while, manufacturing, value, rose, 270, although, it, initially, appeared, that, job, loss, in, the, industrial, sector, might, be, partially, offset, by, the, rapid, growth, of, jobs, in, information, technology, the, recession, of, march, 2001, foreshadowed, a, sharp, drop, in, the, number, of, jobs, in, the, sector, this, pattern, of, decrease, in, jobs, would, continue, until, 2003, and, data, has, shown, that, overall, technology, creates, more, jobs, than, it, destroys, even, in, the, short, run, industry, has, become, more, information, intensive, while, less, labor, and, capital, intensive, this, has, left, important, implications, for, the, workforce, as, workers, have, become, increasingly, productive, as, the, value, of, their, labor, decreases, for, the, system, of, capitalism, itself, the, value, of, labor, decreases, the, value, of, capital, increases, in, the, classical, model, investments, in, human, and, financial, capital, are, important, predictors, of, the, performance, of, a, new, venture, however, as, demonstrated, by, mark, zuckerberg, and, facebook, it, now, seems, possible, for, a, group, of, relatively, inexperienced, people, with, limited, capital, to, succeed, on, a, large, scale, the, information, age, was, enabled, by, technology, developed, in, the, digital, revolution, which, was, itself, enabled, by, building, on, the, developments, of, the, technological, revolution, the, onset, of, the, information, age, can, be, associated, with, the, development, of, transistor, technology, the, concept, of, a, field, effect, transistor, was, first, theorized, by, julius, edgar, lilienfeld, in, 1925, the, first, practical, transistor, was, the, point, contact, transistor, invented, by, the, engineers, walter, houser, brattain, and, john, bardeen, while, working, for, william, shockley, at, bell, labs, in, 1947, this, was, a, breakthrough, that, laid, the, foundations, for, modern, technology, shockley, s, research, team, also, invented, the, bipolar, junction, transistor, in, 1952, the, most, widely, used, type, of, transistor, is, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, invented, by, mohamed, m, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, at, bell, labs, in, 1960, the, complementary, mos, cmos, fabrication, process, was, developed, by, frank, wanlass, and, chih, tang, sah, in, 1963, before, the, advent, of, electronics, mechanical, computers, like, the, analytical, engine, in, 1837, were, designed, to, provide, routine, mathematical, calculation, and, simple, decision, making, capabilities, military, needs, during, world, war, ii, drove, development, of, the, first, electronic, computers, based, on, vacuum, tubes, including, the, z3, the, atanasoff, berry, computer, colossus, computer, and, eniac, the, invention, of, the, transistor, enabled, the, era, of, mainframe, computers, 1950s, 1970s, typified, by, the, ibm, 360, these, large, room, sized, computers, provided, data, calculation, and, manipulation, that, was, much, faster, than, humanly, possible, but, were, expensive, to, buy, and, maintain, so, were, initially, limited, to, a, few, scientific, institutions, large, corporations, and, government, agencies, the, germanium, integrated, circuit, ic, was, invented, by, jack, kilby, at, texas, instruments, in, 1958, the, silicon, integrated, circuit, was, then, invented, in, 1959, by, robert, noyce, at, fairchild, semiconductor, using, the, planar, process, developed, by, jean, hoerni, who, was, in, turn, building, on, mohamed, atalla, s, silicon, surface, passivation, method, developed, at, bell, labs, in, 1957, following, the, invention, of, the, mos, transistor, by, mohamed, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, at, bell, labs, in, 1959, the, mos, integrated, circuit, was, developed, by, fred, heiman, and, steven, hofstein, at, rca, in, 1962, the, silicon, gate, mos, ic, was, later, developed, by, federico, faggin, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1968, with, the, advent, of, the, mos, transistor, and, the, mos, ic, transistor, technology, rapidly, improved, and, the, ratio, of, computing, power, to, size, increased, dramatically, giving, direct, access, to, computers, to, ever, smaller, groups, of, people, the, first, commercial, single, chip, microprocessor, launched, in, 1971, the, intel, 4004, which, was, developed, by, federico, faggin, using, his, silicon, gate, mos, ic, technology, along, with, marcian, hoff, masatoshi, shima, and, stan, mazor, along, with, electronic, arcade, machines, and, home, video, game, consoles, pioneered, by, nolan, bushnell, in, the, 1970s, the, development, of, personal, computers, like, the, commodore, pet, and, apple, ii, both, in, 1977, gave, individuals, access, to, the, computer, however, data, sharing, between, individual, computers, was, either, non, existent, or, largely, manual, at, first, using, punched, cards, and, magnetic, tape, and, later, floppy, disks, the, first, developments, for, storing, data, were, initially, based, on, photographs, starting, with, microphotography, in, 1851, and, then, microform, in, the, 1920s, with, the, ability, to, store, documents, on, film, making, them, much, more, compact, early, information, theory, and, hamming, codes, were, developed, about, 1950, but, awaited, technical, innovations, in, data, transmission, and, storage, to, be, put, to, full, use, magnetic, core, memory, was, developed, from, the, research, of, frederick, w, viehe, in, 1947, and, an, wang, at, harvard, university, in, 1949, with, the, advent, of, the, mos, transistor, mos, semiconductor, memory, was, developed, by, john, schmidt, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1964, in, 1967, dawon, kahng, and, simon, sze, at, bell, labs, described, in, 1967, how, the, floating, gate, of, an, mos, semiconductor, device, could, be, used, for, the, cell, of, a, reprogrammable, rom, following, the, invention, of, flash, memory, by, fujio, masuoka, at, toshiba, in, 1980, toshiba, commercialized, nand, flash, memory, in, 1987, copper, wire, cables, transmitting, digital, data, connected, computer, terminals, and, peripherals, to, mainframes, and, special, message, sharing, systems, leading, to, email, were, first, developed, in, the, 1960s, independent, computer, to, computer, networking, began, with, arpanet, in, 1969, this, expanded, to, become, the, internet, coined, in, 1974, access, to, the, internet, improved, with, the, invention, of, the, world, wide, web, in, 1991, the, capacity, expansion, from, dense, wave, division, multiplexing, optical, amplification, and, optical, networking, in, the, mid, 1990s, led, to, record, data, transfer, rates, by, 2018, optical, networks, routinely, delivered, 30, 4, terabits, s, over, a, fiber, optic, pair, the, data, equivalent, of, 1, 2, million, simultaneous, 4k, hd, video, streams, mosfet, scaling, the, rapid, miniaturization, of, mosfets, at, a, rate, predicted, by, moore, s, law, led, to, computers, becoming, smaller, and, more, powerful, to, the, point, where, they, could, be, carried, during, the, 1980s, 1990s, laptops, were, developed, as, a, form, of, portable, computer, and, personal, digital, assistants, pdas, could, be, used, while, standing, or, walking, pagers, widely, used, by, the, 1980s, were, largely, replaced, by, mobile, phones, beginning, in, the, late, 1990s, providing, mobile, networking, features, to, some, computers, now, commonplace, this, technology, is, extended, to, digital, cameras, and, other, wearable, devices, starting, in, the, late, 1990s, tablets, and, then, smartphones, combined, and, extended, these, abilities, of, computing, mobility, and, information, sharing, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, image, sensors, which, first, began, appearing, in, the, late, 1960s, led, to, the, transition, from, analog, to, digital, imaging, and, from, analog, to, digital, cameras, during, the, 1980s, 1990s, the, most, common, image, sensors, are, the, charge, coupled, device, ccd, sensor, and, the, cmos, complementary, mos, active, pixel, sensor, cmos, sensor, electronic, paper, which, has, origins, in, the, 1970s, allows, digital, information, to, appear, as, paper, documents, by, 1976, there, were, several, firms, racing, to, introduce, the, first, truly, successful, commercial, personal, computers, three, machines, the, apple, ii, commodore, pet, 2001, and, trs, 80, were, all, released, in, 1977, becoming, the, most, popular, by, late, 1978, byte, magazine, later, referred, to, commodore, apple, and, tandy, as, the, 1977, trinity, also, in, 1977, sord, computer, corporation, released, the, sord, m200, smart, home, computer, in, japan, steve, wozniak, known, as, woz, a, regular, visitor, to, homebrew, computer, club, meetings, designed, the, single, board, apple, i, computer, and, first, demonstrated, it, there, with, specifications, in, hand, and, an, order, for, 100, machines, at, us, 500, each, from, the, byte, shop, woz, and, his, friend, steve, jobs, founded, apple, computer, about, 200, of, the, machines, sold, before, the, company, announced, the, apple, ii, as, a, complete, computer, it, had, color, graphics, a, full, qwerty, keyboard, and, internal, slots, for, expansion, which, were, mounted, in, a, high, quality, streamlined, plastic, case, the, monitor, and, i, o, devices, were, sold, separately, the, original, apple, ii, operating, system, was, only, the, built, in, basic, interpreter, contained, in, rom, apple, dos, was, added, to, support, the, diskette, drive, the, last, version, was, apple, dos, 3, 3, its, higher, price, and, lack, of, floating, point, basic, along, with, a, lack, of, retail, distribution, sites, caused, it, to, lag, in, sales, behind, the, other, trinity, machines, until, 1979, when, it, surpassed, the, pet, it, was, again, pushed, into, 4th, place, when, atari, inc, introduced, its, atari, 8, bit, computers, despite, slow, initial, sales, the, lifetime, of, the, apple, ii, was, about, eight, years, longer, than, other, machines, and, so, accumulated, the, highest, total, sales, by, 1985, 2, 1, million, had, sold, and, more, than, 4, million, apple, ii, s, were, shipped, by, the, end, of, its, production, in, 1993, optical, communication, plays, a, crucial, role, in, communication, networks, optical, communication, provides, the, transmission, backbone, for, the, telecommunications, and, computer, networks, that, underlie, the, internet, the, foundation, for, the, digital, revolution, and, information, age, the, two, core, technologies, are, the, optical, fiber, and, light, amplification, the, optical, amplifier, in, 1953, bram, van, heel, demonstrated, image, transmission, through, bundles, of, optical, fibers, with, a, transparent, cladding, the, same, year, harold, hopkins, and, narinder, singh, kapany, at, imperial, college, succeeded, in, making, image, transmitting, bundles, with, over, 10, 000, optical, fibers, and, subsequently, achieved, image, transmission, through, a, 75, cm, long, bundle, which, combined, several, thousand, fibers, gordon, gould, invented, the, optical, amplifier, and, the, laser, and, also, established, the, first, optical, telecommunications, company, optelecom, to, design, communication, systems, the, firm, was, a, co, founder, in, ciena, corp, the, venture, that, popularized, the, optical, amplifier, with, the, introduction, of, the, first, dense, wave, division, multiplexing, system, this, massive, scale, communication, technology, has, emerged, as, the, common, basis, of, all, telecommunication, networks, and, thus, a, foundation, of, the, information, age, manuel, castells, captures, the, significance, of, the, information, age, in, the, information, age, economy, society, and, culture, when, he, writes, of, our, global, interdependence, and, the, new, relationships, between, economy, state, and, society, what, he, calls, a, new, society, in, the, making, he, cautions, that, just, because, humans, have, dominated, the, material, world, does, not, mean, that, the, information, age, is, the, end, of, history, it, is, in, fact, quite, the, opposite, history, is, just, beginning, if, by, history, we, understand, the, moment, when, after, millennia, of, a, prehistoric, battle, with, nature, first, to, survive, then, to, conquer, it, our, species, has, reached, the, level, of, knowledge, and, social, organization, that, will, allow, us, to, live, in, a, predominantly, social, world, it, is, the, beginning, of, a, new, existence, and, indeed, the, beginning, of, a, new, age, the, information, age, marked, by, the, autonomy, of, culture, vis, vis, the, material, basis, of, our, existence, thomas, chatterton, williams, wrote, about, the, dangers, of, anti, intellectualism, in, the, information, age, in, a, piece, for, the, atlantic, although, access, to, information, has, never, been, greater, most, information, is, irrelevant, or, insubstantial, the, information, age, s, emphasis, on, speed, over, expertise, contributes, to, superficial, culture, in, which, even, the, elite, will, openly, disparage, as, pointless, our, main, repositories, for, the, very, best, that, has, been, thought
