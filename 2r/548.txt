border, in, turn, bulgarians, were, furious, about, serbia, s, refusal, to, honour, its, commitments, under, the, 1912, serbo, bulgarian, treaty, which, had, split, the, geographic, region, of, macedonia, into, two, zones, one, contested, between, serbia, and, bulgaria, and, another, one, recognised, by, the, two, countries, as, bulgarian, by, rights, before, the, war, serbia, had, relinquished, its, claim, to, the, territory, east, of, the, ohrid, kriva, palanka, line, in, favour, of, bulgaria, the, uncontested, zone, while, the, future, of, some, 11, 000, square, km, 2, of, territory, forming, the, northwestern, corner, of, geographic, region, of, macedonia, the, contested, zone, was, to, be, decided, by, the, russian, emperor, who, was, senior, arbitrary, and, guarantor, of, the, alliance, assured, by, the, clauses, of, the, treaty, that, it, would, receive, what, it, considered, its, fair, share, of, macedonia, bulgaria, sent, almost, all, of, its, troops, to, the, thracian, front, which, was, expected, to, and, eventually, did, indeed, decide, the, outcome, of, the, war, at, the, same, time, serbia, pushed, into, kosovo, and, northern, macedonia, as, the, establishment, of, an, independent, albanian, state, brokered, by, italy, and, austria, hungary, deprived, the, serbs, of, their, much, coveted, adriatic, port, they, demanded, not, only, the, entire, contested, zone, but, also, all, of, the, uncontested, one, they, had, occupied, bulgarian, efforts, to, appeal, to, the, russian, emperor, quoting, for, example, the, clauses, of, the, treaty, the, material, difference, between, serbian, 29, 698, and, bulgarian, casualties, 87, 926, or, the, surrender, of, the, bulgarian, city, of, silistra, to, romania, as, compensation, for, its, continued, neutrality, proved, futile, russian, foreign, minister, sergey, sazonov, instead, kept, encouraging, bulgaria, to, accede, to, an, ever, increasing, list, of, serbian, demands, in, the, end, bulgaria, s, overreliance, on, the, russian, empire, a, power, which, had, anathemised, the, unification, of, bulgaria, invited, the, ottoman, sultan, to, reconquer, eastern, rumelia, and, organised, a, coup, against, the, bulgarian, prince, only, three, decades, prior, and, which, had, watched, ferdinand, s, charge, towards, istanbul, with, ill, disguised, alarm, due, to, its, own, long, standing, aspirations, towards, the, turkish, straits, bulgaria, s, unwillingness, to, reach, a, compromise, with, greece, despite, several, attempts, made, by, greek, prime, minister,

military, alliance, directed, against, bulgaria, on, the, night, of, 29, june, 1913, the, bulgarian, army, made, an, ill, advised, attempt, to, gain, an, advantage, in, the, negotiations, by, pushing, out, serbian, and, greek, forces, out, of, several, disputed, territories, without, a, battle, plan, or, declaration, of, war, naively, thinking, that, this, would, be, regarded, as, a, mere, altercation, instead, the, action, gave, serbia, and, greece, casus, belli, and, kicked, off, the, second, balkan, war, though, the, balkan, allies, had, fought, together, against, the, common, enemy, that, was, not, enough, to, overcome, their, mutual, rivalries, in, the, original, document, for, the, balkans, league, serbia, promised, bulgaria, most, of, macedonia, but, before, the, first, war, had, come, to, an, end, serbia, in, violation, of, the, previous, agreement, and, greece, revealed, their, plan, to, keep, possession, of, the, territories, that, their, forces, had, occupied, this, act, prompted, the, tsar, of, bulgaria, to, invade, his, allies, the, second, balkan, war, broke, out, on, 29, 16, june, 1913, when, bulgaria, attacked, its, erstwhile, allies, in, the, first, balkan, war, serbia, and, greece, while, montenegro, and, the, ottoman, empire, intervened, later, against, bulgaria, with, romania, attacking, bulgaria, from, the, north, in, violation, of, a, peace, treaty, when, the, greek, army, had, entered, thessaloniki, in, the, first, balkan, war, ahead, of, the, bulgarian, 7th, division, by, only, a, day, they, were, asked, to, allow, a, bulgarian, battalion, to, enter, the, city, greece, accepted, in, exchange, for, allowing, a, greek, unit, to, enter, the, city, of, serres, the, bulgarian, unit, that, entered, thessaloniki, turned, out, to, be, an, 18, 000, strong, division, instead, of, the, battalion, which, caused, concern, among, the, greeks, who, viewed, it, as, a, bulgarian, attempt, to, establish, a, condominium, over, the, city, in, the, event, due, to, the, urgently, needed, reinforcements, in, the, thracian, front, bulgarian, headquarters, was, soon, forced, to, remove, its, troops, from, the, city, while, the, greeks, agreed, by, mutual, treaty, to, remove, their, units, based, in, serres, and, transport, them, to, dedea, a, modern, alexandroupolis, but, it, left, behind, a, battalion, that, started, fortifying, its, positions, greece, had, also, allowed, the, bulgarians, to, control, the, stretch, of, the, thessaloniki, constantinople, railroad, that, lay, in, greek, occupied, territory, since, bulgaria, controlled, the, largest, part, of, this, railroad, towards, thrace, after, the, end, of, the, operations, in, thrace, and, confirming, greek, concerns, bulgaria, was, not, satisfied, with, the, territory, it, controlled, in, macedonia, and, immediately, asked, greece, to, relinquish, its, control, over, thessaloniki, and, the, land, north, of, pieria, effectively, handing, over, all, of, greek, macedonia, these, demands, with, the, bulgarian, refusal, to, demobilize, its, army, after, the, treaty, of, london, had, ended, the, common, war, against, the, ottomans, alarmed, greece, which, decided, to, also, keep, its, army, mobilized, a, month, after, the, second, balkan, war, started, the, bulgarian, community, of, thessaloniki, no, longer, existed, as, hundreds, of, long, time, bulgarian, locals, were, arrested, thirteen, hundred, bulgarian, soldiers, and, about, five, hundred, komitadjis, were, also, arrested, and, transferred, to, greek, prisons, in, november, 1913, the, bulgarians, were, forced, to, admit, their, defeat, as, the, greeks, received, international, recognition, on, their, claim, of, thessaloniki, similarly, in, modern, north, macedonia, the, tension, between, serbia, and, bulgaria, due, to, the, latter, s, aspirations, over, vardar, macedonia, generated, many, incidents, between, their, respective, armies, prompting, serbia, to, keep, its, army, mobilized, serbia, and, greece, proposed, that, each, of, the, three, countries, reduce, its, army, by, a, quarter, as, the, first, step, towards, a, peaceful, solution, but, bulgaria, rejected, it, seeing, the, omens, greece, and, serbia, started, a, series, of, negotiations, and, signed, a, treaty, on, 1, june, 19, may, 1913, with, this, treaty, a, mutual, border, was, agreed, between, the, two, countries, together, with, an, agreement, for, mutual, military, and, diplomatic, support, in, case, of, a, bulgarian, or, and, austro, hungarian, attack, tsar, nicholas, ii, of, russia, being, well, informed, tried, to, stop, the, upcoming, conflict, on, 8, june, by, sending, an, identical, personal, message, to, the, kings, of, bulgaria, and, serbia, offering, to, act, as, arbitrator, according, to, the, provisions, of, the, 1912, serbo, bulgarian, treaty, but, bulgaria, by, making, the, acceptance, of, russian, arbitration, conditional, in, effect, denied, any, discussion, causing, russia, to, repudiate, its, alliance, with, bulgaria, see, russo, bulgarian, military, convention, signed, 31, may, 1902, the, serbs, and, the, greeks, had, a, military, advantage, on, the, eve, of, the, war, because, their, armies, confronted, comparatively, weak, ottoman, forces, in, the, first, balkan, war, and, suffered, relatively, light, casualties, while, the, bulgarians, were, involved, in, heavy, fighting, in, thrace, the, serbs, and, greeks, had, time, to, fortify, their, positions, in, macedonia, the, bulgarians, also, held, some, advantages, controlling, internal, communication, and, supply, lines, on, 29, 16, june, 1913, general, savov, under, direct, orders, of, tsar, ferdinand, i, issued, attack, orders, against, both, greece, and, serbia, without, consulting, the, bulgarian, government, and, without, an, official, declaration, of, war, during, the, night, of, 30, 17, june, 1913, they, attacked, the, serbian, army, at, bregalnica, river, and, then, the, greek, army, in, nigrita, the, serbian, army, resisted, the, sudden, night, attack, while, most, of, the, soldiers, did, not, even, know, who, they, were, fighting, with, as, bulgarian, camps, were, located, next, to, serbs, and, were, considered, allies, montenegro, s, forces, were, just, a, few, kilometers, away, and, also, rushed, to, the, battle, the, bulgarian, attack, was, halted, the, greek, army, was, also, successful, it, retreated, according, to, plan, for, two, days, while, thessaloniki, was, cleared, of, the, remaining, bulgarian, regiment, then, the, greek, army, counterattacked, and, defeated, the, bulgarians, at, kilkis, kukush, after, which, the, mostly, bulgarian, town, was, plundered, and, burnt, and, part, of, its, mostly, bulgarian, population, massacred, by, the, greek, army, following, the, capture, of, kilkis, the, greek, army, s, pace, was, not, quick, enough, to, prevent, the, retaliatory, destruction, of, nigrita, serres, and, doxato, and, massacres, of, non, combatant, greek, inhabitants, at, sidirokastro, and, doxato, by, the, bulgarian, army, the, greek, committed, further, war, crimes, against, the, bulgarian, population, during, it, advance, in, total, about, 160, bulgarian, villages, were, destroyed, and, most, of, their, population, expelled, with, multiple, additional, massacres, of, the, bulgarian, civilian, population, the, greek, army, then, divided, its, forces, and, advanced, in, two, directions, part, proceeded, east, and, occupied, western, thrace, the, rest, of, the, greek, army, advanced, up, to, the, struma, river, valley, defeating, the, bulgarian, army, in, the, battles, of, doiran, and, mt, beles, and, continued, its, advance, to, the, north, towards, sofia, in, the, kresna, straits, the, greeks, were, ambushed, by, the, bulgarian, 2nd, and, 1st, armies, newly, arrived, from, the, serbian, front, that, had, already, taken, defensive, positions, there, following, the, bulgarian, victory, at, kalimanci, by, 30, july, the, greek, army, was, outnumbered, by, the, counter, attacking, bulgarian, army, which, attempted, to, encircle, the, greeks, in, a, cannae, type, battle, by, applying, pressure, on, their, flanks, the, greek, army, was, exhausted, and, faced, logistical, difficulties, the, battle, was, continued, for, 11, days, between, 29, july, and, 9, august, over, 20, km, of, a, maze, of, forests, and, mountains, with, no, conclusion, the, greek, king, seeing, that, the, units, he, fought, were, from, the, serbian, front, tried, to, convince, the, serbs, to, renew, their, attack, as, the, front, ahead, of, them, was, now, thinner, but, the, serbs, declined, by, then, news, came, of, the, romanian, advance, toward, sofia, and, its, imminent, fall, facing, the, danger, of, encirclement, constantine, realized, that, his, army, could, no, longer, continue, hostilities, thus, he, agreed, to, eleftherios, venizelos, proposal, and, accepted, the, bulgarian, request, for, an, armistice, as, had, been, communicated, through, romania, romania, had, raised, an, army, and, declared, war, on, bulgaria, on, 10, july, 27, june, as, it, had, from, 28, 15, june, officially, warned, bulgaria, that, it, would, not, remain, neutral, in, a, new, balkan, war, due, to, bulgaria, s, refusal, to, cede, the, fortress, of, silistra, as, promised, before, the, first, balkan, war, in, exchange, for, romanian, neutrality, its, forces, encountered, little, resistance, and, by, the, time, the, greeks, accepted, the, bulgarian, request, for, an, armistice, they, had, reached, vrazhdebna, 11, km, 7, mi, from, the, center, of, sofia, seeing, the, military, position, of, the, bulgarian, army, the, ottomans, decided, to, intervene, they, attacked, and, finding, no, opposition, managed, to, win, back, all, of, their, lands, which, had, been, officially, ceded, to, bulgaria, as, a, part, of, the, sofia, conference, in, 1914, i, e, thrace, with, its, fortified, city, of, adrianople, regaining, an, area, in, europe, which, was, only, slightly, larger, than, the, present, day, european, territory, of, the, republic, of, turkey, the, developments, that, led, to, the, first, balkan, war, did, not, go, unnoticed, by, the, great, powers, although, there, was, an, official, consensus, between, the, european, powers, over, the, territorial, integrity, of, the, ottoman, empire, which, led, to, a, stern, warning, to, the, balkan, states, unofficially, each, of, them, took, a, different, diplomatic, approach, due, to, their, conflicting, interests, in, the, area, as, a, result, any, possible, preventive, effect, of, the, common, official, warning, was, cancelled, by, the, mixed, unofficial, signals, and, failed, to, prevent, or, to, stop, the, war, the, second, balkan, war, was, a, catastrophic, blow, to, russian, policies, in, the, balkans, which, for, centuries, had, focused, on, access, to, the, warm, seas, first, it, marked, the, end, of, the, balkan, league, a, vital, arm, of, the, russian, system, of, defense, against, austria, hungary, second, the, clearly, pro, serbian, position, russia, had, been, forced, to, take, in, the, conflict, mainly, due, to, the, disagreements, over, land, partitioning, between, serbia, and, bulgaria, caused, a, permanent, break, up, between, the, two, countries, accordingly, bulgaria, reverted, its, policy, to, one, closer, to, the, central, powers, understanding, over, an, anti, serbian, front, due, to, its, new, national, aspirations, now, expressed, mainly, against, serbia, as, a, result, serbia, was, isolated, militarily, against, its, rival, austria, hungary, a, development, that, eventually, doomed, serbia, in, the, coming, war, a, year, later, most, damaging, the, new, situation, effectively, trapped, russian, foreign, policy, after, 1913, russia, could, not, afford, to, lose, its, last, ally, in, this, crucial, area, and, thus, had, no, alternatives, but, to, unconditionally, support, serbia, when, the, crisis, between, serbia, and, austria, escalated, in, 1914, this, was, a, position, that, inevitably, drew, russia, into, an, unwelcome, world, war, with, devastating, results, since, it, was, less, prepared, both, militarily, and, socially, for, that, event, than, any, other, great, power, austria, hungary, took, alarm, at, the, great, increase, in, serbia, s, territory, at, the, expense, of, its, national, aspirations, in, the, region, as, well, as, serbia, s, rising, status, especially, to, austria, hungary, s, slavic, populations, this, concern, was, shared, by, germany, which, saw, serbia, as, a, satellite, of, russia, these, concerns, contributed, significantly, to, the, two, central, powers, willingness, to, go, to, war, against, serbia, this, meant, that, when, a, serbian, backed, organization, assassinated, archduke, franz, ferdinand, of, austria, the, reform, minded, heir, to, the, austro, hungarian, throne, causing, the, 1914, july, crisis, the, conflict, quickly, escalated, and, resulted, in, the, first, world, war, the, epilogue, to, this, nine, month, pan, balkan, war, was, drawn, mostly, by, the, treaty, of, bucharest, 10, august, 1913, delegates, of, greece, serbia, montenegro, and, bulgaria, hosted, by, the, deputy, of, romania, arrived, in, bucharest, to, settle, negotiations, ottoman, s, request, to, participate, was, rejected, on, the, basis, that, the, talks, were, to, deal, with, matters, strictly, among, the, balkan, allies, the, great, powers, maintained, a, very, influential, presence, but, they, did, not, dominate, the, proceedings, the, treaty, partitioned, macedonia, made, changes, to, the, balkan, borders, and, established, the, independent, state, of, albania, serbia, gained, the, territory, of, north, east, macedonia, settled, the, eastern, borders, with, bulgaria, and, gained, the, eastern, half, of, the, sanjak, of, novi, bazar, doubling, its, size, montenegro, gained, the, western, half, of, the, sanjak, of, novi, bazar, and, secured, the, borders, with, serbia, greece, more, than, doubled, its, size, by, gaining, southern, epirus, the, biggest, part, of, southern, macedonia, including, the, city, port, of, kavala, in, its, eastern, border, the, aegean, islands, were, annexed, by, the, greek, kingdom, apart, from, the, dodecanese, and, the, cretan, unification, was, completed, and, formalized, romania, annexed, the, southern, part, of, dobruja, province, bulgaria, even, though, defeated, managed, to, hold, some, territorial, gains, from, the, first, balkan, war, bulgaria, embraced, a, portion, of, macedonia, including, the, town, of, strumnitza, and, western, thrace, with, a, 70, mile, aegean, coastline, including, the, port, town, of, alexandroupolis, the, bulgarian, delegates, then, met, the, ottomans, for, negotiations, in, constantinople, bulgaria, s, hope, to, regain, lost, territories, in, eastern, thrace, where, the, bulk, of, bulgarian, forces, had, struggled, to, conquer, and, many, died, was, dashed, as, the, turks, retained, the, lands, they, had, regained, in, the, counter, attack, the, straight, line, of, ainos, midia, was, not, accepted, for, the, eastern, border, the, regions, of, lozengrad, lyule, burgas, buni, hisar, and, adrianople, reverted, to, the, ottomans, after, this, treaty, of, constantinople, 30, september, 1913, bulgaria, sought, an, alliance, with, the, ottoman, empire, against, greece, and, serbia, in, support, of, their, claims, to, macedonia, this, was, followed, by, the, treaty, of, athens, 14, november, 1913, between, the, turks, and, greeks, concluding, the, conflict, between, them, however, the, status, of, the, aegean, islands, under, greek, control, was, left, in, question, especially, the, islands, of, imvros, and, tenedos, strategically, positioned, near, the, dardanelles, straights, even, after, signing, this, treaty, relations, between, the, two, countries, remained, very, bad, and, war, almost, broke, out, in, spring, 1914, finally, the, second, treaty, in, constantinople, re, established, the, relations, between, serbia, and, the, ottoman, empire, concluding, officially, the, balkan, wars, montenegro, never, signed, a, pact, with, the, turks, the, balkan, wars, brought, to, an, end, ottoman, rule, of, the, balkan, peninsula, except, for, eastern, thrace, and,
