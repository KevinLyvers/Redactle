western, portion, of, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, southern, of, gabon, and, the, republic, of, the, congo, at, its, greatest, extent, it, reached, from, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, west, to, the, kwango, river, in, the, east, and, from, the, congo, river, in, the, north, to, the, kwanza, river, in, the, south, the, kingdom, consisted, of, several, core, provinces, ruled, by, the, manikongo, the, portuguese, version, of, the, kongo, title, mwene, kongo, meaning, lord, or, ruler, of, the, kongo, kingdom, but, its, sphere, of, influence, extended, to, neighbouring, kingdoms, such, as, ngoyo, kakongo, loango, ndongo, and, matamba, the, latter, two, located, in, what, is, angola, today, from, c, 1390, to, 1862, it, was, an, independent, state, from, 1862, to, 1914, it, functioned, intermittently, as, a, vassal, state, of, the, kingdom, of, portugal, in, 1914, following, the, portuguese, suppression, of, a, kongo, revolt, portugal, abolished, the, titular, monarchy, the, title, of, king, of, kongo, was, restored, from, 1915, until, 1975, as, an, honorific, without, real, power, the, remaining, territories, of, the, kingdom, were, assimilated, into, the, colonies, of, portuguese, angola, the, belgian, congo, and, the, republic, of, cabinda, respectively, the, modern, day, bundu, dia, kongo, sect, favours, reviving, the, kingdom, through, secession, from, angola, the, republic, of, the, congo, and, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, oral, traditions, about, the, early, history, of, the, country, were, set, in, writing, for, the, first, time, in, the, late, 16th, century, and, especially, detailed, versions, were, recorded, in, the, mid, 17th, century, include, those, written, by, the, italian, capuchin, missionary, giovanni, cavazzi, da, montecuccolo, traditions, about, the, foundation, changed, over, time, depending, on, historical, circumstances, modern, research, into, oral, tradition, including, recording, them, in, writing, began, in, the, 1910s, with, mpetelo, boka, and, lievan, sakala, boku, writing, in, kikongo, and, extended, by, redemptorist, missionaries, like, jean, cuvelier, and, joseph, de, munck, in, 1934, cuvelier, published, a, kikongo, language, summary, of, these, traditions, in, nkutama, a, mvila, za, makanda, although, cuvelier, and, other, scholars, contended, that, these, traditions, applied, to, the, earliest, period, of, kongo, s, history, it, is, more, likely, that, they, relate, primarily, to, local, traditions, of, clans, makanda, and, especially, to, the, period, following, 1750, before, the, founding, of, kongo, the, region, it, would, eventually, control, was, under, the, control, of, several, minor, kingdoms, according, to, a, tradition, recorded, in, the, mid, 1580s, it, named, several, former, kingdoms, which, were, included, in, kongo, nsundi, mpangu, and, mbata, along, the, inkisi, on, the, east, and, wandu, south, of, them, then, mpemba, in, the, center, and, soyo, and, mbamba, on, the, seacoast, south, of, the, congo, river, according, to, kongo, tradition, in, the, seventeenth, century, the, kingdom, s, origin, was, in, vungu, a, small, polity, which, lay, north, of, the, congo, river, and, which, had, extended, its, authority, across, the, congo, to, mpemba, kasi, which, was, itself, the, northernmost, territory, of, a, larger, kingdom, called, mpemba, whose, capital, was, located, about, 150, miles, south, a, dynasty, of, rulers, from, this, small, polity, built, up, its, rule, along, the, kwilu, valley, or, what, was, called, nsi, a, kwilu, and, its, elite, are, buried, near, its, center, traditions, from, the, 17th, century, allude, to, this, sacred, burial, ground, according, to, the, missionary, girolamo, da, montesarchio, an, italian, capuchin, who, visited, the, area, from, 1650, to, 1652, the, site, was, so, holy, that, looking, upon, it, was, deadly, these, rocks, may, be, the, rugged, uplands, of, lovo, where, there, is, extensive, cave, and, rock, art, that, dates, from, at, least, the, fifteenth, century, at, some, point, around, 1375, nimi, a, nzima, ruler, of, mpemba, kasi, and, vungu, made, an, alliance, with, nsaku, lau, the, ruler, of, the, neighboring, mbata, kingdom, nimi, a, nzima, married, lukeni, lua, nsanze, luqueni, luansanze, in, the, text, nsaku, lau, s, daughter, this, alliance, guaranteed, that, each, of, the, two, allies, would, help, ensure, the, succession, of, its, ally, s, lineage, in, the, other, s, territory, mbata, in, turn, was, a, former, province, of, the, seven, kingdoms, of, kongo, dia, nlaza, whose, capital, lay, farther, east, along, the, current, border, of, angola, and, democratic, republic, of, congo, mbata, may, have, been, the, senior, partner, in, the, original, alliance, as, he, had, the, title, of, nkaka, andi, a, mwene, kongo, or, grandfather, of, the, king, of, kongo, nimi, a, nzima, and, lukeni, lua, nsanze, s, son, lukeni, lua, nimi, circa, 1380, 1420, began, the, expansion, that, would, found, the, kingdom, of, kongo, the, name, nimi, a, lukeni, appeared, in, later, oral, traditions, and, some, modern, historians, notably, jean, cuvelier, popularized, it, lukeni, lua, nimi, or, nimi, a, lukeni, led, expansion, southward, into, lands, ruled, by, mpemba, he, established, a, new, base, on, the, mountain, mongo, dia, kongo, and, made, alliances, with, the, mwene, mpangala, ruler, of, a, market, town, then, loyal, to, mpemba, and, also, with, the, mwene, kabunga, whose, lands, lay, west, of, there, of, uncertain, loyalty, but, the, site, of, a, famous, shrine, two, centuries, later, the, mwene, kabunga, s, descendants, still, symbolically, challenged, the, conquest, in, an, annual, celebration, he, furthered, this, with, a, second, more, important, alliance, with, vunda, another, of, mpemba, s, subordinate, rulers, to, cement, this, alliance, as, with, the, one, with, mbata, lukeni, lua, nimi, allowed, him, to, be, an, elector, to, the, kingdom, after, the, death, of, nimi, a, lukeni, the, rulers, that, followed, lukeni, claimed, relation, to, his, kanda, or, lineage, and, were, known, as, the, kilukeni, the, kilukeni, kanda, or, house, as, it, was, recorded, in, portuguese, language, documents, written, in, kongo, ruled, kongo, unopposed, until, 1567, the, 16th, century, tradition, contended, that, the, former, kingdoms, in, ancient, times, had, separate, kings, but, now, all, are, subjects, and, tributaries, of, the, king, of, congo, tradition, noted, that, in, each, case, the, governorship, was, given, to, members, of, the, royal, family, or, other, noble, families, governors, who, served, terms, determined, by, the, king, had, the, right, to, appoint, their, own, clients, to, lower, positions, down, to, villages, who, had, their, own, locally, chosen, leadership, as, this, centralization, increased, the, allied, provinces, gradually, lost, influence, until, their, powers, were, only, symbolic, manifested, in, mbata, once, a, co, kingdom, but, by, 1620, simply, known, by, the, title, grandfather, of, the, king, of, kongo, nkaka, ndi, a, mwene, kongo, the, kingdom, of, the, kongo, s, early, campaigns, of, expansion, brought, new, populations, under, the, kingdom, s, control, and, produced, many, war, captives, starting, in, the, 14th, century, and, reaching, its, height, in, the, 17th, century, the, kings, of, the, kongo, forcibly, relocated, captured, peoples, to, the, royal, capital, at, mbanza, kongo, the, resulting, high, concentration, of, population, around, mbanza, kongo, and, its, outskirts, played, a, critical, role, in, the, centralization, of, kongo, the, capital, was, a, densely, settled, area, in, an, otherwise, sparsely, populated, region, where, rural, population, densities, probably, did, not, exceed, 5, persons, per, km, 2, early, portuguese, travelers, described, mbanza, kongo, as, a, large, city, the, size, of, the, portuguese, town, of, vora, as, it, was, in, 1491, by, the, end, of, the, sixteenth, century, kongo, s, population, was, probably, over, half, a, million, people, in, a, core, region, of, some, 130, 000, square, kilometers, by, the, early, seventeenth, century, the, city, and, its, hinterland, had, a, population, of, around, 100, 000, or, nearly, one, out, of, every, six, inhabitants, in, the, kingdom, according, to, baptismal, statistics, compiled, by, a, jesuit, priest, in, 1623, while, the, kingdom, as, a, whole, numbered, some, 780, 000, the, concentration, of, population, economic, activity, and, political, power, in, mbanza, kongo, strengthened, the, kongolese, monarchy, and, allowed, for, a, centralized, government, captives, taken, in, war, were, enslaved, and, integrated, into, the, local, population, producing, a, food, and, labor, surplus, while, rural, regions, of, the, kingdom, paid, taxes, in, the, form, of, goods, the, capital, could, not, produce, itself, a, class, of, urban, nobility, developed, in, the, capital, and, their, demand, for, positions, at, court, and, consumer, goods, fueled, the, kingdom, s, economy, rural, development, was, intentionally, discouraged, by, the, kongolese, king, ensuring, the, capital, remained, the, economic, and, political, center, of, the, kingdom, this, concentration, allowed, resources, soldiers, and, surplus, foodstuffs, to, be, readily, available, at, the, request, of, the, king, and, made, the, king, overwhelmingly, powerful, when, compared, to, any, potential, rival, by, the, time, of, the, first, recorded, contact, with, the, europeans, the, kingdom, of, kongo, was, sited, at, the, centre, of, an, extensive, trading, network, apart, from, natural, resources, and, ivory, the, country, manufactured, and, traded, copperware, ferrous, metal, goods, raffia, cloth, and, pottery, the, kongo, people, spoke, in, the, kikongo, language, the, eastern, regions, especially, that, part, known, as, the, seven, kingdoms, of, kongo, dia, nlaza, were, particularly, famous, for, the, production, of, cloth, in, 1483, the, portuguese, explorer, diogo, c, o, reached, the, coast, of, the, kongo, kingdom, c, o, left, some, of, his, men, in, kongo, and, took, kongo, nobles, to, portugal, he, returned, to, kongo, with, the, kongo, nobles, in, 1485, such, commissioning, hiring, or, even, kidnapping, of, local, africans, to, use, as, local, ambassadors, especially, for, newly, contacted, areas, was, by, then, an, already, established, practice, at, that, point, the, ruling, king, nzinga, a, nkuwu, decided, he, would, become, christian, and, sent, another, large, mission, headed, by, kala, ka, mfusu, the, noble, who, had, earlier, gone, to, portugal, as, a, hostage, they, remained, in, europe, for, nearly, four, years, studying, christianity, and, learning, reading, and, writing, the, mission, returned, with, c, o, along, with, catholic, priests, and, soldiers, in, 1491, baptizing, nzinga, a, nkuwu, as, well, as, his, principal, nobles, starting, with, the, ruler, of, soyo, the, coastal, province, nzinga, a, nkuwu, took, the, christian, name, of, jo, o, i, in, honor, of, portugal, s, king, at, the, time, jo, o, ii, jo, o, i, ruled, until, his, death, around, 1509, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, afonso, mvemba, a, nzinga, he, faced, a, serious, challenge, from, a, half, brother, mpanzu, a, kitima, the, king, overcame, his, brother, in, a, battle, waged, at, mbanza, kongo, according, to, afonso, s, own, account, sent, to, portugal, in, 1506, he, was, able, to, win, the, battle, thanks, to, the, intervention, of, a, heavenly, vision, of, the, cross, saint, james, and, the, virgin, mary, inspired, by, these, events, he, subsequently, designed, a, coat, of, arms, for, kongo, that, was, used, by, all, following, kings, on, official, documents, royal, paraphernalia, and, the, like, until, 1860, while, king, jo, o, i, later, reverted, to, his, traditional, beliefs, afonso, i, established, christianity, as, the, state, religion, of, his, kingdom, upon, his, ascension, as, king, in, 1509, afonso, i, worked, to, create, a, viable, version, of, the, catholic, church, in, kongo, providing, for, its, income, from, royal, assets, and, taxation, that, provided, salaries, for, its, workers, with, advisers, from, portugal, such, as, rui, d, aguiar, the, portuguese, royal, chaplain, sent, to, assist, kongo, s, religious, development, afonso, created, a, syncretic, version, of, christianity, that, would, remain, a, part, of, its, culture, for, the, rest, of, the, kingdom, s, independent, existence, king, afonso, himself, studied, hard, at, this, task, rui, d, aguiar, once, said, afonso, i, knew, more, of, the, church, s, tenets, than, he, did, the, kongo, church, was, always, short, of, ordained, clergy, and, made, up, for, it, by, the, employment, of, a, strong, laity, kongolese, school, teachers, or, mestres, kikongo, alongi, a, aleke, were, the, anchor, of, this, system, recruited, from, the, nobility, and, trained, in, the, kingdom, s, schools, they, provided, religious, instruction, and, services, to, others, building, upon, kongo, s, growing, christian, population, at, the, same, time, they, permitted, the, growth, of, syncretic, forms, of, christianity, which, incorporated, older, religious, ideas, with, christian, ones, examples, of, this, are, the, introduction, of, kikongo, words, to, translate, christian, concepts, the, kikongo, words, ukisi, an, abstract, word, meaning, charm, but, used, to, mean, holy, and, nkanda, meaning, book, were, merged, so, that, the, christian, bible, became, known, as, the, nkanda, ukisi, holy, book, the, church, became, known, as, the, nzo, a, ukisi, holy, house, while, some, european, clergy, often, denounced, these, mixed, traditions, they, were, never, able, to, root, them, out, part, of, the, establishment, of, this, church, was, the, creation, of, a, strong, priesthood, and, to, this, end, afonso, s, son, henrique, was, sent, to, europe, to, be, educated, henrique, became, an, ordained, priest, and, in, 1518, was, named, as, titular, bishop, of, utica, a, north, african, diocese, recently, reclaimed, from, the, muslims, he, returned, to, kongo, in, the, early, 1520s, to, run, kongo, s, new, church, he, died, in, 1531, slavery, had, existed, since, the, kingdom, of, kongo, s, founding, as, during, its, early, wars, of, expansion, the, nascent, kingdom, had, taken, many, captives, kongo, s, tradition, of, forcibly, transferring, peoples, captured, in, wars, to, the, royal, capital, was, key, to, the, power, of, the, kongolese, king, and, it, was, the, same, mechanism, of, enslavement, and, transfer, of, population, that, made, kongo, an, efficient, exporter, of, slaves, kongolese, laws, and, cultural, traditions, protected, freeborn, kongolese, from, enslavement, and, so, most, of, the, enslaved, population, were, war, captives, convicted, kongolese, criminals, could, also, be, forced, into, slavery, but, were, initially, protected, from, sale, outside, the, kingdom, the, export, of, female, slaves, was, also, prohibited, afonso, s, early, letters, show, evidence, of, domestic, slave, markets, as, relations, between, kongo, and, portugal, grew, in, the, early, 16th, century, trade, between, the, kingdoms, also, increased, most, of, the, trade, was, in, palm, cloth, copper, and, ivory, but, also, increasing, numbers, of, slaves, although, initially, kongo, exported, few, slaves, following, the, development, of, a, successful, sugar, growing, colony, on, the, portuguese, island, of, s, o, tom, kongo, became, a, major, source, of, slaves, for, the, island, s, traders, and, plantations, the, cantino, atlas, of, 1502, mentions, kongo, as, a, source, of, slaves, for, the, s, o, tom, colony, but, notes, they, were, few, correspondence, by, afonso, also, show, the, purchase, and, sale, of, slaves, within, the, country, and, his, accounts, on, capturing, slaves, in, war, which, were, given, and, sold, to, portuguese, merchants, afonso, continued, to, expand, the, kingdom, of, kongo, into, the, 1540s, expanding, its, borders, to, the, south, and, east, the, expansion, of, kongo, s, population, coupled, with, his, earlier, religious, reforms, allowed, afonso, to, centralize, power, in, his, capital, and, increase, the, power, of, the, monarchy, he, also, established, a, royal, monopoly, on, some, trade, to, govern, the, growing, slave, trade, afonso, and, several, portuguese, kings, claimed, a, joint, monopoly, on, the, external, slave, trade, however, as, the, slave, trade, grew, in, size, it, came, to, gradually, erode, royal, power, in, kongo, portuguese, traders, based, in, s, o, tom, began, violating, the, royal, monopoly, on, the, slave, trade, trading, instead, with, other, african, states, in, the, region, portuguese, merchants, also, began, to, trade, goods, with, powerful, kongolese, nobles, depriving, the, monarchy, of, tax, revenue, while, portuguese, priests, and, merchants, living, in, the, kongo, became, increasingly, politically, active, new, markets, for, slaves, such, as, mpanzalumbu, a, rebel, kongolese, province, conquered, by, afonso, in, 1526, and, the, mbundu, kingdom, of, ndongo, also, harmed, the, kongolese, monopoly, on, the, slave, trade, in, 1526, afonso, complained, in, correspondence, to, king, jo, o, iii, of, portugal, about, merchants, violation, of, his, end, of, the, monopoly, claiming, that, portuguese, officials, had, not, regulated, them, sufficiently, and, threatened, to, stop, the, slave, trade, altogether, afonso, noted, that, some, unscrupulous, nobles, were, resorting, to, kidnapping, their, fellow, kongolese, to, supply, the, slave, trade, to, reform, the, trade, afonso, reiterated, the, need, to, follow, kongolese, law, and, not, enslave, kongolese, freemen, while, also, establishing, a, board, to, better, regulate, the, slave, trade, afonso, also, established, a, special, committee, to, determine, the, legality, of, the, enslavement, of, those, who, were, being, sold, however, the, kings, of, portugal, eventually, determined, the, best, way, to, deal, with, the, trade, through, the, kwanza, to, ndongo, was, to, establish, their, own, base, there, in, 1560, again, responding, to, a, request, from, angola, the, portuguese, crown, sent, paulo, dias, de, novais, as, ambassador, to, ndongo, with, the, idea, of, settling, relations, with, the, country, ngola, kiluanji, was, not, interested, in, this, mission, however, as, it, offered, only, baptism, and, diplomatic, relations, while, he, hoped, for, military, support, in, 1575, portugal, would, follow, with, a, mission, of, conquest, also, under, paulo, dias, de, novais, this, time, to, conquer, the, country, and, monopolize, its, slave, trade, a, common, characteristic, of, political, life, in, the, kingdom, of, kongo, was, fierce, competition, over, succession, to, the, throne, afonso, s, own, contest, for, the, throne, was, intense, and, he, had, to, fight, a, major, battle, with, his, half, brother, and, probably, against, lesser, enemies, in, the, early, years, of, his, reign, afonso, described, his, ascent, to, the, throne, representing, it, as, specifically, a, war, by, pagans, against, the, christian, ruler, but, this, was, probably, more, propaganda, on, his, part, and, succession, struggles, were, probably, normal, even, in, the, early, years, of, the, kingdom, a, great, deal, is, known, about, how, such, struggles, took, place, from, the, contest, that, followed, afonso, s, death, in, late, 1542, or, early, 1543, this, is, in, large, part, due, to, a, detailed, inquest, conducted, by, royal, officials, in, 1550, which, survives, in, the, portuguese, archives, in, this, inquest, one, can, see, that, factions, formed, behind, prominent, men, such, as, afonso, i, s, son, pedro, nkanga, a, mvemba, and, diogo, nkumbi, a, mpudi, his, grandson, who, ultimately, overthrew, pedro, in, 1545, although, the, factions, placed, themselves, in, the, idiom, of, kinship, using, the, portuguese, term, gera, o, or, lineage, probably, kanda, in, kikongo, they, were, not, formed, strictly, along, heredity, lines, since, close, kin, were, often, in, separate, factions, the, players, included, nobles, holding, appointive, titles, to, provincial, governorships, members, of, the, royal, council, and, also, officials, in, the, now, well, developed, church, hierarchy, king, diogo, i, skillfully, replaced, or, outmaneuvered, his, entrenched, competitors, after, he, was, crowned, in, 1545, he, faced, a, major, conspiracy, led, by, pedro, i, who, had, taken, refuge, in, a, church, and, whom, diogo, in, respect, of, the, church, s, rule, of, asylum, allowed, to, remain, in, the, church, however, diogo, did, conduct, an, inquiry, into, the, plot, the, text, of, which, was, sent, to, portugal, in, 1552, which, shows, the, way, in, which, plotters, hoped, to, overthrow, the, king, by, enticing, his, supporters, to, abandon, him, king, diogo, s, successor, afonso, ii, was, killed, by, the, portuguese, days, after, his, succession, and, an, uprising, occurred, which, killed, the, portuguese, candidate, allowing, king, bernardo, i, of, kongo, to, be, enthroned, however, king, bernardo, i, was, killed, by, the, jaga, yaka, invasion, in, 1567, and, was, replaced, by, henrique, i, who, was, also, killed, while, fighting, in, the, east, leaving, the, government, in, the, hands, of, his, stepson, lvaro, nimi, a, lukeni, lua, mvemba, he, was, crowned, lvaro, i, by, common, consent, according, duarte, lopes, kongo, s, ambassador, to, rome, lvaro, i, was, not, directly, descended, from, a, previous, king, and, so, his, seizure, of, the, throne, in, the, midst, of, the, crisis, caused, by, the, jaga, invasion, marked, the, beginning, of, a, new, royal, line, the, house, of, kwilu, there, were, certainly, factions, that, opposed, him, though, it, is, not, known, specifically, who, they, were, lvaro, s, rule, began, in, war, with, the, jagas, who, may, have, been, external, invaders, or, rebels, from, within, the, country, either, peasants, or, nobles, from, rival, factions, fighting, against, the, profound, changes, and, instability, introduced, by, european, trading, and, slaving, as, the, jagas, drove, him, from, the, capital, to, refuge, on, an, island, in, the, congo, river, alvaro, appealed, to, portugal, for, aid, and, was, sent, an, expedition, under, francisco, de, gouveia, sottomaior, governor, of, s, o, tom, as, a, part, of, the, same, process, lvaro, agreed, to, allow, the, portuguese, to, establish, a, colony, in, luanda, the, source, of, the, nzimbu, shell, money, used, by, the, kingdom, 218, in, addition, kongo, provided, the, portuguese, with, support, in, their, war, against, the, kingdom, of, ndongo, in, 1579, the, kingdom, of, ndongo, was, located, inland, east, of, luanda, and, although, claimed, in, kongo, s, royal, titles, as, early, as, 1535, was, probably, never, under, a, firm, kongo, administration, lvaro, also, worked, hard, to, westernize, kongo, gradually, introducing, european, style, titles, for, his, nobles, so, that, the, mwene, nsundi, became, the, duke, of, nsundi, the, mwene, mbamba, became, the, duke, of, mbamba, the, mwene, mpemba, became, marquis, of, mpemba, and, the, mwene, soyo, became, count, of, soyo, in, 1607, he, and, his, son, lvaro, ii, nimi, a, nkanga, crowned, in, 1587, bestowed, orders, of, chivalry, called, the, order, of, christ, the, capital, was, also, renamed, s, o, salvador, or, holy, savior, in, portuguese, during, this, period, in, 1596, lvaro, s, emissaries, to, rome, persuaded, the, pope, to, recognize, s, o, salvador, as, the, cathedral, of, a, new, diocese, which, would, include, kongo, and, the, portuguese, territory, in, angola, however, the, king, of, portugal, won, the, right, to, nominate, the, bishops, to, this, see, which, became, a, source, of, tension, between, the, two, countries, portuguese, bishops, in, the, kingdom, were, often, favourable, to, european, interests, in, a, time, when, relations, between, kongo, and, angola, were, tense, they, refused, to, appoint, priests, forcing, kongo, to, rely, more, and, more, heavily, on, the, laity, documents, of, the, time, show, that, lay, teachers, called, mestres, in, portuguese, language, documents, were, paid, salaries, and, appointed, by, the, crown, and, at, times, kongo, kings, withheld, income, and, services, to, the, bishops, and, their, supporters, a, tactic, called, country, excommunication, controlling, revenue, was, vital, for, kongo, s, kings, since, even, jesuit, missionaries, were, paid, salaries, from, the, royal, exchequer, at, the, same, time, as, this, ecclesiastical, problem, developed, the, governors, of, angola, began, to, extend, their, campaigns, into, areas, that, kongo, regarded, as, firmly, under, its, sovereignty, this, included, the, region, around, nambu, a, ngongo, which, governor, jo, o, furtado, attacked, in, the, mid, 1590s, other, campaigns, in, the, vicinity, led, to, denunciations, by, the, rulers, of, kongo, against, these, violations, of, their, sovereignty, lvaro, i, and, his, successor, lvaro, ii, also, faced, problems, with, factional, rivals, from, families, that, had, been, displaced, from, succession, in, order, to, raise, support, against, some, enemies, they, had, to, make, concessions, to, others, one, of, the, most, important, of, these, concessions, was, allowing, manuel, the, count, of, soyo, to, hold, office, for, many, years, beginning, some, time, before, 1591, during, this, same, period, lvaro, ii, made, a, similar, concession, to, ant, nio, da, silva, the, duke, of, mbamba, ant, nio, da, silva, was, strong, enough, to, decide, the, succession, of, the, kingdom, selecting, bernardo, ii, in, 1614, but, putting, him, aside, in, favor, of, lvaro, iii, in, 1615, it, was, only, with, difficulty, that, lvaro, iii, was, able, to, put, his, own, choice, in, as, duke, of, mbamba, when, ant, nio, da, silva, died, in, 1620, instead, of, having, the, province, fall, into, the, hands, of, the, duke, s, son, at, the, same, time, however, lvaro, iii, created, another, powerful, and, semi, independent, nobleman, in, manuel, jord, o, who, held, nsundi, for, him, tensions, between, portugal, and, kongo, increased, further, as, the, governors, of, portuguese, angola, became, more, aggressive, luis, mendes, de, vasconcelos, who, arrived, as, governor, in, 1617, used, mercenary, african, groups, called, imbangala, to, make, a, devastating, war, on, ndongo, and, then, to, raid, and, pillage, some, southern, kongo, provinces, he, was, particularly, interested, in, the, province, of, kasanze, a, marshy, region, that, lay, just, north, of, luanda, many, slaves, being, deported, through, luanda, fled, into, this, region, and, were, often, granted, sanctuary, and, for, this, reason, mendes, de, vasconcelos, decided, that, a, determined, action, was, needed, to, stop, it, the, next, governor, of, angola, jo, o, correia, de, sousa, used, the, imbangala, to, launch, a, full, scale, invasion, of, southern, kongo, in, 1622, following, the, death, of, lvaro, iii, correia, de, sousa, claimed, he, had, the, right, to, choose, the, king, of, kongo, he, was, also, upset, that, the, kongolese, electors, chose, pedro, ii, a, former, duke, of, mbamba, pedro, ii, was, originally, from, the, duchy, of, nsundi, hence, the, name, of, the, royal, house, he, created, the, house, of, nsundi, correia, de, sousa, also, contended, that, pedro, ii, had, sheltered, runaway, slaves, from, angola, during, the, latter, s, governorship, of, mbamba, the, first, kongo, portuguese, war, began, in, 1622, initially, because, of, a, portuguese, campaign, against, the, kasanze, kingdom, which, was, conducted, ruthlessly, from, there, the, army, moved, to, nambu, a, ngongo, whose, ruler, pedro, afonso, was, held, to, be, sheltering, runaway, slaves, as, well, although, pedro, afonso, facing, an, overwhelming, army, of, over, 20, 000, agreed, to, return, some, runaways, the, army, attacked, his, country, and, killed, him, following, its, success, in, nambu, a, ngongo, the, portuguese, army, advanced, into, mbamba, in, november, the, portuguese, forces, scored, a, victory, at, the, battle, of, mbumbi, there, they, faced, a, quickly, gathered, local, force, led, by, the, new, duke, of, mbamba, and, reinforced, by, forces, from, mpemba, led, by, its, marquis, both, the, duke, of, mbamba, and, the, marquis, of, mpemba, were, killed, in, the, battle, according, to, esikongo, accounts, they, were, eaten, by, the, imbangala, allies, of, the, portuguese, however, pedro, ii, the, newly, crowned, king, of, kongo, brought, the, main, army, including, troops, from, soyo, down, into, mbamba, and, decisively, defeated, the, portuguese, driving, them, from, the, country, at, a, battle, waged, somewhere, near, mbanda, kasi, in, january, 1623, portuguese, residents, of, kongo, frightened, by, the, consequences, for, their, business, of, the, invasion, wrote, a, hostile, letter, to, correia, de, sousa, denouncing, his, invasion, following, the, defeat, of, the, portuguese, at, mbanda, kasi, pedro, ii, declared, angola, an, official, enemy, the, king, then, wrote, letters, denouncing, correia, de, sousa, to, the, king, of, spain, and, the, pope, meanwhile, anti, portuguese, riots, broke, out, all, over, the, kingdom, and, threatened, its, long, established, merchant, community, portuguese, throughout, the, country, were, humiliatingly, disarmed, and, even, forced, to, give, up, their, clothes, pedro, anxious, not, to, alienate, the, portuguese, merchant, community, and, aware, that, they, had, generally, remained, loyal, during, the, war, did, as, much, as, he, could, to, preserve, their, lives, and, property, leading, some, of, his, detractors, to, call, him, king, of, portuguese, as, a, result, of, kongo, s, victory, the, portuguese, merchant, community, of, luanda, revolted, against, the, governor, hoping, to, preserve, their, ties, with, the, king, backed, by, the, jesuits, who, had, also, just, recommenced, their, mission, there, they, forced, jo, o, correia, de, sousa, to, resign, and, flee, the, country, the, interim, government, that, followed, the, departure, was, led, by, the, bishop, of, angola, they, were, very, conciliatory, to, kongo, and, agreed, to, return, over, a, thousand, of, the, slaves, captured, by, correia, de, sousa, especially, the, lesser, nobles, captured, at, the, battle, of, mbumbi, regardless, of, the, overtures, of, the, new, government, in, angola, pedro, ii, had, not, forgotten, the, invasion, and, planned, to, remove, the, portuguese, from, the, realm, altogether, the, king, sent, a, letter, to, the, dutch, estates, general, proposing, a, joint, military, attack, on, angola, with, a, kongo, army, and, a, dutch, fleet, he, would, pay, the, dutch, with, gold, silver, and, ivory, for, their, efforts, as, planned, a, dutch, fleet, under, the, command, of, the, celebrated, admiral, piet, heyn, arrived, in, luanda, to, carry, out, an, attack, in, 1624, the, plan, failed, to, come, to, fruition, as, by, then, pedro, had, died, and, his, son, garcia, mvemba, a, nkanga, was, elected, king, king, garcia, i, was, more, forgiving, of, the, portuguese, and, had, been, successfully, persuaded, by, their, various, gestures, of, conciliation, he, was, unwilling, to, press, the, attack, on, angola, at, that, time, contending, that, as, a, catholic, he, could, not, ally, with, non, catholics, to, attack, the, city, the, end, of, the, first, quarter, of, the, 17th, century, saw, a, new, flare, up, in, kongo, s, political, struggle, at, the, heart, of, the, conflict, were, two, noble, houses, fighting, over, the, kingship, on, one, side, of, the, conflict, was, the, house, of, kwilu, which, counted, most, of, the, kings, named, lvaro, they, were, ousted, by, the, opposing, house, of, nsundi, when, pedro, ii, was, placed, on, the, throne, by, powerful, local, forces, in, s, o, salvador, probably, as, a, compromise, when, lvaro, iii, died, without, an, heir, old, enough, to, rule, as, the, reigning, power, the, house, of, nsundi, worked, earnestly, to, place, partisans, in, king, making, positions, throughout, the, empire, either, pedro, ii, or, garcia, i, managed, to, secure, soyo, in, the, hands, of, count, paulo, who, held, it, and, supported, the, house, of, nsundi, from, about, 1625, until, 1641, meanwhile, manuel, jord, o, a, partisan, of, the, house, of, kwilu, managed, to, force, garcia, i, to, flee, and, placed, ambr, sio, i, of, the, house, of, kwilu, on, the, throne, king, ambr, sio, either, could, not, or, did, not, remove, paulo, from, soyo, though, he, did, eventually, remove, jord, o, after, a, rule, marked, by, rumors, of, war, mobilizations, and, other, disruptions, a, great, riot, at, the, capital, resulted, in, the, death, of, the, king, by, a, mob, ambrosio, was, replaced, with, alvaro, iv, by, the, duke, of, mbamba, daniel, da, silva, king, alvaro, iv, was, only, eleven, at, the, time, and, easily, manipulated, in, 1632, daniel, da, silva, marched, on, the, capital, in, order, to, rescue, his, nephew, from, his, enemies, at, the, time, he, was, under, the, protection, of, the, count, of, soyo, paulo, alvaro, nimi, a, lukeni, a, nzenze, a, ntumba, and, his, brother, garcia, ii, nkanga, a, lukeni, after, a, dramatic, battle, in, soyo, the, young, king, was, successfully, restored, only, to, be, later, poisoned, by, alvaro, v, a, kimpanzu, after, waging, a, second, war, against, his, cousins, nimi, a, lukeni, and, nkanga, a, lukeni, alvaro, v, was, killed, and, replaced, by, alvaro, vi, in, 1636, initiating, the, house, of, kinlaza, s, rule, over, kongo, following, his, death, in, 1641, alvaro, vi, s, brother, took, over, and, was, crowned, garcia, ii, the, former, house, of, nsundi, was, consolidated, with, their, house, of, kwilu, rivals, as, the, kimpanzu, lineage, of, the, dead, alvaro, v, garcia, ii, took, the, throne, on, the, eve, of, several, crises, one, of, his, rivals, daniel, da, silva, who, probably, received, the, patronage, of, the, daniel, da, silva, who, was, killed, by, garcia, ii, while, defending, alvaro, iv, managed, to, secure, the, county, of, soyo, and, used, it, as, a, base, against, garcia, ii, for, the, whole, of, his, reign, as, a, result, garcia, ii, was, prevented, from, completely, consolidating, his, authority, another, problem, facing, king, garcia, ii, was, a, rebellion, in, the, dembos, region, which, also, threatened, his, authority, lastly, there, was, the, agreement, made, by, pedro, ii, in, 1622, promising, kongo, s, support, to, the, dutch, in, an, offensive, to, oust, portugal, from, luanda, in, 1641, the, dutch, invaded, angola, and, captured, luanda, after, an, almost, bloodless, struggle, they, immediately, sought, to, renew, their, alliance, with, kongo, which, had, had, a, false, start, in, 1624, when, garcia, i, refused, to, assist, a, dutch, attack, on, luanda, while, relations, between, sao, salvador, and, luanda, were, not, warm, the, two, polities, had, enjoyed, an, easy, peace, due, to, the, former, s, internal, distractions, and, the, latter, s, war, against, the, kingdom, of, matamba, the, same, year, of, the, portuguese, ouster, from, luanda, kongo, entered, into, a, formal, agreement, with, the, new, government, and, agreed, to, provide, military, assistance, as, needed, garcia, ii, ejected, nearly, all, portuguese, and, luso, african, merchants, from, his, kingdom, the, colony, of, angola, was, declared, an, enemy, once, again, and, the, duke, of, mbamba, was, sent, with, an, army, to, assist, the, dutch, the, dutch, also, provided, kongo, with, military, assistance, in, exchange, for, payment, in, slaves, in, 1642, the, dutch, sent, troops, to, help, garcia, ii, put, down, an, uprising, by, peoples, of, the, southern, district, in, the, dembos, region, the, government, quickly, put, down, the, nsala, rebellion, reaffirming, the, kongo, dutch, alliance, king, garcia, ii, paid, the, dutch, for, their, services, in, slaves, taken, from, ranks, of, dembos, rebels, these, slaves, were, sent, to, pernambuco, brazil, where, the, dutch, had, taken, over, a, portion, of, the, portuguese, sugar, producing, region, a, dutch, kongo, force, attacked, portuguese, bases, on, the, bengo, river, in, 1643, in, retaliation, for, portuguese, harassment, the, dutch, captured, portuguese, positions, and, forced, their, rivals, to, withdraw, to, dutch, forts, on, the, kwanza, river, at, muxima, and, masangano, following, this, victory, the, dutch, once, again, appeared, to, lose, interest, in, conquering, the, colony, of, angola, as, in, their, conquest, of, pernambuco, the, dutch, west, india, company, was, content, to, allow, the, portuguese, to, remain, inland, the, dutch, sought, to, spare, themselves, the, expense, of, war, and, instead, relied, on, control, of, shipping, to, profit, from, the, colony, thus, to, garcia, s, chagrin, the, portuguese, and, dutch, signed, a, peace, treaty, in, 1643, ending, the, brief, albeit, successful, war, with, the, portuguese, out, of, the, way, and, an, end, to, dutch, pursuit, of, troops, garcia, ii, could, finally, turn, his, attention, to, the, growing, threat, posed, by, the, count, of, soyo, while, garcia, was, disappointed, that, his, alliance, with, the, dutch, could, not, drive, out, the, portuguese, it, did, free, him, to, turn, his, attention, to, the, growing, threat, posed, by, the, count, of, soyo, the, counts, of, soyo, were, initially, strong, partisans, of, the, house, of, nsundi, and, its, successor, the, house, of, kinlaza, count, paulo, had, assisted, in, the, rise, of, the, kinlaza, to, power, however, paulo, died, at, about, the, same, time, as, garcia, became, king, in, 1641, a, rival, count, daniel, da, silva, from, the, house, of, kwilu, took, control, of, the, county, as, a, partisan, of, the, newly, formed, kimpanzu, faction, he, would, claim, that, soyo, had, the, right, to, choose, its, own, ruler, though, garcia, never, accepted, this, claim, and, spent, much, of, the, first, part, of, his, reign, fighting, against, it, garcia, did, not, support, da, silva, s, move, as, soyo, s, ruler, was, one, of, the, most, important, offices, in, kongo, in, 1645, garcia, ii, sent, a, force, against, daniel, da, silva, under, the, command, of, his, son, afonso, the, campaign, was, a, failure, due, to, kongo, s, inability, to, take, soyo, s, fortified, position, at, mfinda, ngula, worse, still, afonso, was, captured, in, the, battle, forcing, garcia, to, engage, in, humiliating, negotiations, with, da, silva, to, win, back, his, son, s, freedom, italian, capuchin, missionaries, who, had, just, arrived, in, soyo, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, assisted, in, the, negotiations, in, 1646, garcia, sent, a, second, military, force, against, soyo, but, his, forces, were, again, defeated, because, garcia, was, so, intent, on, subduing, soyo, he, was, unable, to, make, a, full, military, effort, to, assist, the, dutch, in, their, war, against, portugal, the, dutch, were, convinced, that, they, could, avoid, committing, their, forces, to, any, further, wars, and, made, peace, with, portugal, in, 1643, while, retaining, their, military, presence, in, their, part, of, angola, the, portuguese, moved, aggressively, against, queen, njinga, and, when, portuguese, reinforcements, managed, to, defeat, her, at, kavanga, in, 1646, the, dutch, felt, obliged, to, be, more, aggressive, queen, njinga, persuaded, garcia, ii, to, send, forces, to, assist, in, another, venture, against, the, portuguese, in, 1647, kongo, troops, participated, in, the, battle, of, kombi, where, they, soundly, defeated, the, portuguese, field, army, after, forcing, them, to, fight, defensively, subsequently, njinga, s, army, besieged, all, the, portuguese, in, the, interior, of, the, colony, a, year, later, portuguese, reinforcements, from, brazil, forced, the, dutch, to, surrender, luanda, and, withdraw, from, angola, in, 1648, the, new, portuguese, governor, salvador, de, s, sought, terms, with, kongo, demanding, the, island, of, luanda, the, source, of, kongo, s, money, supply, of, nzimbu, shells, although, neither, kongo, nor, angola, ever, ratified, the, treaty, sent, to, the, king, in, 1649, the, portuguese, gained, de, facto, control, of, the, island, the, war, resulted, in, the, dutch, losing, their, claims, in, central, africa, njinga, being, forced, back, into, matamba, the, portuguese, restored, to, their, coastal, position, kongo, lost, or, gained, nothing, other, than, the, indemnity, garcia, paid, which, ended, hostilities, between, the, two, rival, powers, portugal, began, pressing, claims, over, southern, vassals, of, kongo, especially, the, country, of, mbwila, following, portuguese, restoration, at, luanda, mbwila, a, nominal, vassal, of, kongo, had, also, signed, a, treaty, of, vassalage, with, portugal, in, 1619, it, divided, its, loyalty, between, the, colony, of, angola, and, kongo, in, the, intervening, period, though, the, portuguese, often, attacked, mbwila, they, never, brought, it, under, their, authority, kongo, began, working, towards, a, spanish, alliance, especially, following, ant, nio, i, s, succession, as, king, in, 1661, although, it, is, not, clear, what, diplomatic, activities, he, engaged, in, with, spain, itself, the, portuguese, clearly, believed, that, he, hoped, to, repeat, the, dutch, invasion, this, time, with, the, assistance, of, spain, ant, nio, sent, emissaries, to, the, dembos, region, and, to, matamba, and, mbwila, attempting, to, form, a, new, anti, portuguese, alliance, the, portuguese, had, been, troubled, moreover, by, kongo, support, of, runaway, slaves, who, flocked, to, southern, kongo, throughout, the, 1650s, at, the, same, time, the, portuguese, were, advancing, their, own, agenda, for, mbwila, which, they, claimed, as, a, vassal, in, 1665, both, sides, invaded, mbwila, and, their, rival, armies, met, each, other, at, ulanga, in, the, valley, below, mbanza, mbwila, capital, of, the, district, at, the, battle, of, mbwila, in, 1665, the, portuguese, forces, from, angola, had, their, first, victory, against, the, kingdom, of, kongo, since, 1622, they, defeated, the, forces, under, ant, nio, i, killing, him, and, many, of, his, courtiers, as, well, as, the, luso, african, capuchin, priest, manuel, roboredo, also, known, by, his, cloister, name, of, francisco, de, s, o, salvador, who, had, attempted, to, prevent, this, final, war, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, of, mbwila, there, was, no, clear, succession, the, country, was, divided, between, rival, claimants, to, the, throne, the, two, factions, kimpanzu, and, kinlaza, hardened, and, partitioned, the, country, between, them, pretenders, would, ascend, to, the, throne, and, then, be, ousted, the, period, was, marked, by, an, increase, in, bakongo, slaves, being, sold, across, the, atlantic, the, weakening, of, the, kongo, monarchy, and, the, strengthening, of, soyo, during, this, chaos, kongo, was, being, increasingly, manipulated, by, soyo, in, an, act, of, desperation, the, central, authority, in, kongo, called, on, luanda, to, attack, soyo, in, return, for, various, concessions, the, portuguese, invaded, the, county, of, soyo, in, 1670, they, met, with, no, more, success, than, garcia, ii, being, roundly, defeated, by, soyo, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, kitombo, on, 18, october, 1670, the, kingdom, of, kongo, was, to, remain, completely, independent, though, still, embroiled, in, civil, war, thanks, to, the, very, force, portuguese, colonials, it, had, fought, so, long, to, destroy, this, portuguese, defeat, was, resounding, enough, to, end, all, portuguese, ambitions, in, kongo, s, sphere, of, influence, until, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, battles, between, the, kimpanzu, and, kinlaza, continued, plunging, the, kingdom, into, a, chaos, not, known, in, centuries, the, fighting, between, the, two, lineages, led, to, the, sack, of, s, o, salvador, in, 1678, ironically, the, capital, built, by, the, pact, of, mpemba, and, mbata, was, burned, to, the, ground, not, by, the, portuguese, or, rival, african, nations, but, by, its, very, heirs, the, city, and, hinterland, around, mbanza, kongo, became, depopulated, the, population, dispersed, into, the, mountain, top, fortresses, of, the, rival, kings, these, were, the, mountain, of, kibangu, east, of, the, capital, and, the, fortress, of, the, guas, rosadas, a, line, founded, in, the, 1680s, from, descendants, of, kinlaza, and, kimpanzu, the, region, of, mbula, or, lemba, where, a, line, founded, by, the, kinlaza, pretender, pedro, iii, ruled, and, lovota, a, district, in, southern, soyo, that, sheltered, a, kimpanzu, lineage, whose, head, was, d, suzanna, de, n, brega, finally, d, ana, afonso, de, le, o, founded, her, own, center, on, the, mbidizi, river, at, nkondo, and, guided, her, junior, kinsmen, to, reclaim, the, country, even, as, she, sought, to, reconcile, the, hostile, factions, in, the, interim, however, tens, of, thousands, fleeing, the, conflict, or, caught, up, in, the, battles, were, sold, as, slaves, to, european, slave, traders, every, year, one, human, stream, led, north, to, loango, whose, merchants, known, as, vili, mubires, in, the, period, carried, them, primarily, to, merchants, bound, for, north, america, and, the, caribbean, and, others, were, taken, south, to, luanda, where, they, were, sold, to, portuguese, merchants, bound, for, brazil, by, the, end, of, the, seventeenth, century, several, long, wars, and, interventions, by, the, now, independent, counts, of, soyo, who, restyled, themselves, as, grand, princes, had, brought, an, end, to, kongo, s, golden, age, as, the, 17th, century, drew, to, a, close, several, places, once, part, of, kongo, became, de, facto, independent, this, included, areas, such, as, nsonso, in, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, kongo, artists, began, making, crucifixes, and, other, religious, objects, that, depicted, jesus, as, an, african, such, objects, produced, by, many, workshops, over, a, long, period, given, their, variety, reflect, that, emerging, belief, that, kongo, was, a, central, part, of, the, christian, world, and, fundamental, to, its, history, a, story, of, the, eighteenth, century, was, that, the, partially, ruined, cathedral, of, s, o, salvador, originally, constructed, for, the, jesuits, in, 1549, and, eventually, elevated, to, cathedral, status, was, actually, built, overnight, by, angels, it, was, called, affectionately, nkulumbimbi, pope, john, paul, ii, would, eventually, say, mass, at, this, cathedral, in, 1992, manuel, ii, of, kongo, succeeded, pedro, iv, in, 1718, manuel, ii, ruled, over, a, restored, and, restive, kingdom, until, his, death, in, 1743, however, soyo, s, provincial, status, in, the, kingdom, nominal, for, years, limited, manuel, s, power, nsundi, on, the, north, had, also, more, or, less, become, independent, although, still, claiming, to, be, part, of, the, larger, kingdom, and, more, or, less, permanently, ruled, by, a, kimpanzu, family, even, within, the, remaining, portions, of, the, kingdom, there, were, still, powerful, and, violent, rivalries, at, least, one, major, war, took, place, in, the, 1730s, in, the, province, of, mbamba, pedro, iv, s, successor, garcia, iv, nkanga, a, mvandu, ruled, from, 1743, to, 1752, pedro, iv, s, restoration, required, his, successor, s, membership, in, a, branch, of, the, kinlaza, faction, resident, in, matadi, that, had, sworn, loyalty, to, pedro, iv, in, 1716, other, kinlaza, branches, had, developed, in, the, north, at, lemba, and, matari, and, in, the, south, along, the, mbidizi, river, in, lands, that, had, been, ruled, by, d, ana, afonso, de, le, o, de, le, o, s, lands, came, to, be, called, the, lands, of, the, queen, the, system, of, alternating, succession, broke, down, in, 1764, when, lvaro, xi, a, kinlaza,

and, never, acknowledged, the, usurpation, a, regent, of, pedro, s, successor, claimed, the, throne, in, the, early, 1780s, and, pressed, his, claims, against, a, jos, i, a, kinlaza, from, the, mbidizi, valley, branch, of, the, royal, family, jos, won, the, showdown, fought, at, s, o, salvador, in, 1781, a, massive, battle, involving, 30, 000, soldiers, on, jos, s, side, alone, to, show, his, contempt, for, his, defeated, rival, jos, refused, to, allow, the, soldiers, of, the, other, faction, to, receive, christian, burial, jos, s, power, was, limited, as, he, had, no, sway, over, the, lands, controlled, by, the, kinlaza, faction, of, lemba, and, matari, even, though, they, were, technically, of, the, same, family, and, he, did, not, follow, up, his, victory, to, extend, his, authority, over, the, kimpanzu, lands, around, luvota, at, the, same, time, the, lands, around, mount, kibangu, pedro, iv, s, original, base, was, controlled, as, it, had, been, for, the, whole, eighteenth, century, by, members, of, the, gua, rosada, family, who, claimed, descent, from, both, the, kimpanzu, and, kinlaza, jos, ruled, until, 1785, when, he, handed, power, over, to, his, brother, afonso, v, 1785, 87, afonso, s, brief, reign, ended, in, his, sudden, death, rumored, to, be, by, poisoning, a, confused, struggle, broke, out, following, afonso, s, death, by, 1794, the, throne, ended, up, in, the, hands, of, henrique, i, a, man, of, uncertain, factional, origin, who, arranged, for, three, parties, to, divide, the, succession, garcia, v, abrogated, the, arrangement, proclaiming, himself, king, in, 1805, he, ruled, until, 1830, andr, ii, who, followed, garcia, v, appeared, to, have, restored, the, older, rotational, claims, as, he, was, from, the, northern, branch, of, the, kinlaza, whose, capital, had, moved, from, matadi, to, manga, andre, ruled, until, 1842, when, henrique, ii, from, the, southern, mbidizi, valley, branch, of, the, same, family, overthrew, him, henrique, ii, developed, his, power, in, the, same, manner, as, other, entrepreneurial, nobles, by, founding, villages, of, slaves, or, followers, and, drawing, strength, from, them, andre, however, did, not, accept, his, fate, and, withdrew, with, his, followers, to, mbanza, mputo, a, village, just, beyond, the, edge, of, s, o, salvador, where, he, and, his, descendants, kept, up, their, claims, king, henrique, iii, who, came, to, power, after, overthrowing, andr, ii, ruled, kongo, from, 1842, until, his, death, in, 1857, while, aleixo, de, gua, rosada, brother, of, king, henrique, iii, ordered, a, dembo, chief, nambwa, ng, ngo, not, to, pay, a, new, portuguese, tax, in, 1841, his, capture, and, imprisonment, by, the, portuguese, took, place, some, time, after, he, ordered, nambwa, ng, ngo, in, the, 1750s, and, beyond, a, new, class, of, nobles, emerged, in, kongo, while, they, belonged, to, the, less, category, of, nobles, they, lived, by, banditry, and, captured, people, to, found, new, villages, under, their, control, they, took, advantage, of, the, lack, of, control, that, higher, nobles, had, over, their, territories, to, construct, fortified, locations, one, of, the, more, famous, of, these, nobles, is, only, known, by, the, sobriquet, mbwa, lau, mad, dog, who, along, with, several, other, nobles, founded, a, fortified, settlement, not, far, from, the, capital, a, portuguese, missionary, priest, raveled, with, an, order, from, the, bishop, demanding, that, kongo, nobles, cease, selling, slaves, to, merchants, from, loango, called, vilis, because, they, would, be, selling, catholics, to, protestants, as, the, trade, of, loango, included, english, and, dutch, merchants, mbwa, lau, abused, the, priest, and, threatened, to, kill, him, the, weak, documentary, record, does, not, record, the, rise, of, these, nobles, in, detail, although, modern, traditions, of, the, more, successful, may, allow, their, reconstruction, even, members, of, the, higher, nobility, founded, their, own, villages, of, captured, people, or, persuaded, the, commoners, to, join, them, for, protection, the, kings, who, no, longer, operated, as, the, heads, of, a, responsible, bureaucracy, might, appoint, them, as, dukes, or, marquis, but, they, only, ever, controlled, the, lands, they, ruled, themselves, while, the, entrepreneurial, nobles, sought, local, political, and, economic, power, they, also, sold, slaves, into, the, slave, trade, and, it, was, largely, their, small, scale, wars, and, captures, of, other, people, that, fed, the, growing, trade, from, the, country, to, the, new, world, the, most, destructive, part, of, kongo, s, long, involvement, in, the, slave, trade, probably, occurred, in, this, period, in, 1839, the, portuguese, government, acting, on, british, pressure, abolished, the, slave, trade, south, of, the, equator, which, had, so, damaged, central, africa, human, trafficking, continued, until, well, into, the, 1920s, first, as, an, illegal, slave, trade, then, as, contract, labor, a, commodity, trade, replaced, the, slave, trade, at, first, focused, on, ivory, and, wax, but, gradually, grew, to, include, peanuts, and, rubber, this, trade, revolutionized, the, economies, and, eventually, the, politics, of, the, whole, of, central, africa, in, place, of, the, slave, trade, largely, under, the, control, of, state, authorities, thousands, and, eventually, hundreds, of, thousands, of, commoners, began, carrying, goods, from, inland, to, coastal, ports, these, people, managed, to, share, in, the, wealth, of, the, new, trade, and, as, a, result, commercially, connected, people, constructed, new, villages, and, challenged, the, authorities, during, this, period, as, the, slave, trade, ended, long, distance, trade, became, more, prominent, and, entrepreneurial, nobles, became, more, stable, founding, markets, and, protecting, trade, they, founded, new, makanda, nominally, clans, descended, from, common, ancestors, that, were, as, much, trading, associations, as, family, units, these, clans, founded, strings, of, villages, connected, by, fictional, kinship, along, the, trade, routes, from, boma, or, the, coast, of, soyo, to, s, o, salvador, and, then, on, into, the, interior, a, new, oral, tradition, about, the, founder, of, the, kingdom, often, held, to, be, afonso, i, described, the, kingdom, as, originating, when, the, king, caused, the, clans, to, disperse, in, all, directions, the, histories, of, these, clans, typically, describing, the, travels, of, their, founder, and, his, followers, from, an, origin, point, to, their, final, villages, replaced, the, history, of, the, kingdom, itself, in, many, areas, despite, violent, rivalries, and, the, fracturing, of, the, kingdom, it, continued, to, exist, independently, well, into, the, 19th, century, lvaro, ndongo, a, kimpanzu, claimed, the, throne, on, behalf, of, the, kinlaza, faction, of, matari, ignoring, the, existence, of, andre, s, group, at, mbanza, puto, calling, himself, lvaro, xiii, while, pedro, lelo, claimed, the, throne, on, behalf, of, the, mbidizi, valley, faction, of, the, kinlaza, from, a, base, at, bembe, pedro, ultimately, won, a, long, military, struggle, thanks, to, soliciting, portuguese, aid, and, with, their, help, his, soldiers, defeated, lvaro, in, 1859, like, andr, ii, lvaro, xiii, did, not, accept, defeat, and, established, his, own, base, at, nkunga, not, far, from, s, o, salvador, the, portuguese, support, which, had, put, pedro, lelo, on, the, throne, had, a, price, for, when, he, was, crowned, pedro, v, he, was, actually, the, second, king, named, pedro, v, the, first, one, ruled, in, the, late, 1770s, he, had, also, sworn, a, treaty, of, vassalage, to, portugal, portugal, thus, gained, nominal, authority, over, kongo, when, pedro, gained, control, of, it, in, 1859, and, even, constructed, a, fort, in, s, o, salvador, to, house, a, garrison, in, the, same, year, prince, nicolas, protested, vassalage, of, kongo, by, publishing, a, letter, in, the, newspaper, jornal, do, comm, rcio, in, lisbon, on, 1, december, in, 1866, citing, excessive, costs, the, portuguese, government, withdrew, its, garrison, pedro, was, able, to, continue, reigning, over, kongo, although, he, faced, increasing, rivalry, from, clan, based, trading, magnates, who, drained, his, authority, from, much, of, the, country, the, most, dangerous, of, these, was, garcia, mbwaka, matu, of, the, town, of, makuta, this, town, had, been, founded, by, a, man, named, kuvo, one, of, the, entrepreneurial, nobles, his, successors, including, garcia, made, a, great, deal, of, controlling, markets, in, the, new, trading, regime, though, this, was, a, great, challenge, in, the, 1870s, after, garcia, s, death, in, 1880, makuta, became, less, problematic, at, the, conference, of, berlin, of, 1884, 1885, european, powers, divided, most, of, central, africa, between, them, portugal, claimed, the, lion, s, share, of, what, remained, of, independent, kongo, however, portugal, was, not, then, in, a, position, to, make, effective, occupation, king, pedro, v, continued, to, rule, until, his, death, in, 1891, and, was, able, to, use, the, portuguese, to, strengthen, his, control, in, 1888, he, voluntarily, reaffirmed, kongo, s, position, as, a, portuguese, vassal, state, after, a, revolt, against, the, portuguese, in, 1914, portugal, declared, the, abolition, of, the, kingdom, of, kongo, of, which, the, ruler, at, that, time, was, manuel, iii, of, kongo, ending, native, rule, and, replacing, it, with, direct, colonial, rule, however, according, to, the, almanach, de, bruxelles, a, series, of, titular, kings, kept, on, using, the, title, until, at, least, until, 1964, when, a, dispute, over, the, succession, began, the, kingdom, s, army, consisted, of, a, mass, levy, of, archers, drawn, from, the, general, male, population, and, a, smaller, corps, of, heavy, infantry, who, fought, with, swords, and, carried, shields, for, protection, portuguese, documents, typically, referred, to, heavy, infantry, considered, nobles, as, fidalgos, in, documents, the, bearing, of, a, shield, was, also, important, as, portuguese, documents, usually, called, the, heavy, infantry, as, adargueiros, shield, bearers, the, shields, of, the, heavy, infantry, extended, from, the, knees, unto, the, neck, of, the, soldier, but, this, force, lacked, armor, most, shield, bearers, bore, a, scimitar, shaped, longsword, as, described, by, military, historian, wayne, lee, shield, bearers, were, limited, by, number, and, approximately, 1000, were, deployed, in, most, kongo, armies, some, archers, especially, those, in, eastern, kongo, used, poison, arrows, there, is, weak, evidence, to, suggest, revenue, assignments, paid, and, supported, them, a, large, number, perhaps, as, many, as, 20, 000, stayed, in, the, capital, smaller, contingents, lived, in, the, major, provinces, under, the, command, of, provincial, rulers, kongo, imported, european, arms, such, as, swords, into, the, military, in, 1583, soldiers, of, the, mbamba, province, were, armed, with, longswords, similar, to, that, of, the, slavonians, portuguese, emissary, duarte, lopez, believed, this, sword, could, cut, a, slave, in, two, after, 1600, civil, war, became, far, more, common, than, inter, state, warfare, the, government, instituted, a, draft, for, the, entire, population, during, wartime, but, only, a, limited, number, actually, served, many, who, did, not, carry, arms, instead, carried, baggage, and, supplies, thousands, of, women, supported, armies, on, the, move, administrators, expected, soldiers, to, have, two, weeks, worth, of, food, upon, reporting, for, campaign, duty, logistical, difficulties, probably, limited, both, the, size, of, armies, and, their, capacity, to, operate, for, extended, periods, some, portuguese, sources, suggested, that, the, king, of, kongo, fielded, armies, as, large, as, 70, 000, soldiers, for, a, 1665, battle, of, mbwila, but, it, is, unlikely, that, armies, larger, than, 20, 30, 000, troops, could, be, raised, for, military, campaigns, troops, were, mobilized, and, reviewed, on, saint, james, day, 25, july, when, taxes, were, also, collected, subjects, celebrated, this, day, in, honor, of, saint, james, and, afonso, i, whose, miraculous, victory, over, his, brother, in, 1509, was, the, principal, significance, of, the, holiday, in, the, kongo, when, the, portuguese, arrived, in, kongo, they, were, immediately, added, as, a, mercenary, force, probably, under, their, own, commander, and, used, special, purpose, weapons, like, crossbows, and, muskets, to, add, force, to, the, normal, kongo, order, of, battle, their, initial, impact, was, muted, afonso, complained, in, a, letter, of, 1514, that, they, had, not, been, very, effective, in, a, war, he, waged, against, munza, a, mbundu, rebel, the, year, before, by, the, 1580s, however, a, musketeer, corps, which, was, locally, raised, from, resident, portuguese, and, their, kongo, mesti, o, mixed, race, offspring, was, a, regular, part, of, the, main, kongo, army, in, the, capital, provincial, armies, had, some, musketeers, for, example, they, served, against, the, portuguese, invading, army, in, 1622, three, hundred, and, sixty, musketeers, served, in, the, kongo, army, against, the, portuguese, at, the, battle, of, mbwila, kongolese, forces, became, accustomed, to, firearms, in, the, 18th, century, primary,

an, extent, in, the, 18th, century, according, to, historian, thornton, a, kongolese, unit, that, faced, portuguese, forces, in, 1790, sometimes, employed, artillery, in, 1509, afonso, i, of, kongo,
