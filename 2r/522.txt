required, the, spanish, negotiators, were, furious, over, the, immodist, demands, of, a, conqueror, but, their, wounded, pride, was, assuaged, by, an, offer, of, twenty, million, dollars, for,

to, otis, the, war, department, had, sent, an, enciphered, copy, of, the, benevolent, assimilation, proclamation, to, general, miller, for, informational, purposes, miller, assumed, that, it, was, for, distribution, and, unaware, that, a, politically, bowdlerized, version, had, been, published, by, otis, published, the, original, in, both, spanish, and, tagalog, translations, which, eventually, made, their, way, to, aguinaldo, even, before, aguinaldo, received, the, unaltered, version, and, observed, the, changes, in, the, copy, he, had, received, from, otis, he, was, upset, that, otis, had,

solicit, him, to, desist, from, his, rash, enterprise, but, they, were, not, listened, to, my, government, can, not, remain, indifferent, in, view, of, such, a, violent, and, aggressive, seizure, of, a, portion, of, its, territory, by, a, nation, which, arrogated, to, itself, the, title, champion, of, oppressed, nations, thus, it, is, that, my, government, is, disposed, to, open, hostilities, if, the, american, troops, attempt, to, take, forcible, possession, of, the, visayan, islands, i, denounce, these, acts, before, the, world, in, order, that, the, conscience, of, mankind, may, pronounce,

on, the, sovereignty, of, these, islands, i, equally, protest, in, the, name, of, the, filipino, people, against, the, said, intrusion, because, as, they, have, granted, their, vote, of, confidence,

among, the, most, civilized, peoples, of, the, world, and, announced, that, the, united, states, is, anxious, to, establish, in, the, philippine, islands, an, enlightened, system, of, government,

to, suppression, of, the, resistance, tactics, became, focused, on, the, control, of, key, areas, with, internment, and, segregation, of, the, civilian, population, in, zones, of, protection, from, the, guerrillas, many, of, the, interned, civilians, died, from, dysentery, general, otis, gained, notoriety, for, some, of, his, actions, although, his, superiors, had, directed, otis, to, avoid, military, conflict, he, did, little, to, prevent, war, otis, refused, to, accept, anything, but, unconditional, surrender, from, the, philippine, army, he, often, made, major, military, decisions, without, first, consulting, washington, he, acted, aggressively, in, dealing, with, the, filipinos, under, the, assumption, that, their, resistance, would, collapse, quickly, even, after, this, assumption, proved, false, he, continued, to, insist, that, the, insurgency, had, been, defeated, and, that, the, remaining, casualties, were, caused, by, isolated, bands, of, outlaws, otis, was, also, active, in, suppressing, information, about, american, military, tactics, when, letters, describing, american, atrocities, reached, the, american, media, otis, had, each, press, clipping, forwarded, to, the, original, writer, s, commanding, officer, who, would, convince, or, force, the, soldier, to, retract, his, statements, estimates, of, the, filipino, forces, vary, between, 80, 000, and, 100, 000, with, tens, of, thousands, of, auxiliaries, most, of, the, forces, were, armed, only, with, bolo, knives, bows, and, arrows, spears, and, other, primitive, weapons, which, were, vastly, inferior, to, the, guns, and, other, weapons, of, the, american, forces, a, fairly, rigid, indigenous, caste, system, existed, in, the, philippines, before, the, spanish, colonial, era, which, partially, survived, among, the, natives, during, spanish, rule, the, goal, or, end, state, sought, by, the, first, philippine, republic, was, a, sovereign, independent, stable, nation, led, by, an, oligarchy, composed, of, members, of, the, educated, class, known, as, the, ilustrado, class, local, chieftains, landowners, businessmen, and, cabezas, de, barangay, were, the, principales, who, controlled, local, politics, the, war, was, at, its, peak, when, ilustrados, principales, and, peasants, were, unified, in, opposition, to, annexation, by, the, united, states, the, peasants, who, represented, the, majority, of, the, fighting, forces, had, interests, different, from, their, ilustrado, leaders, and, the, principales, of, their, villages, coupled, with, the, ethnic, and, geographic, fragmentation, aligning, the, interests, of, people, from, different, social, castes, was, a, daunting, task, the, challenge, for, aguinaldo, and, his, generals, was, to, sustain, unified, filipino, public, opposition, this, was, the, revolutionaries, strategic, center, of, gravity, the, filipino, operational, center, of, gravity, was, the, ability, to, sustain, its, force, of, 100, 000, irregulars, in, the, field, the, filipino, general, francisco, macabulos, described, the, filipinos, war, aim, as, not, to, vanquish, the, u, s, army, but, to, inflict, on, them, constant, losses, in, the, early, stages, of, the, war, the, philippine, revolutionary, army, employed, the, conventional, military, tactics, typical, of, an, organized, armed, resistance, the, hope, was, to, inflict, enough, american, casualties, to, result, in, mckinley, s, defeat, by, william, jennings, bryan, in, the, 1900, presidential, election, they, hoped, that, bryan, who, held, strong, anti, imperialist, views, would, withdraw, the, american, forces, from, the, philippines, mckinley, s, election, victory, in, 1900, was, demoralizing, for, the, insurgents, and, convinced, many, filipinos, that, the, united, states, would, not, depart, quickly, coupled, with, a, series, of, devastating, losses, on, the, battlefield, against, american, forces, equipped, with, superior, technology, and, training, aguinaldo, became, convinced, that, he, needed, to, change, his, approach, beginning, on, september, 14, 1899, aguinaldo, accepted, the, advice, of, general, gregorio, del, pilar, and, authorized, the, use, of, guerrilla, warfare, tactics, in, subsequent, military, operations, in, bulacan, for, most, of, 1899, the, revolutionary, leadership, had, viewed, guerrilla, warfare, strategically, only, as, a, tactical, option, of, final, recourse, not, as, a, means, of, operation, which, better, suited, their, disadvantaged, situation, on, november, 13, 1899, aguinaldo, decreed, that, guerrilla, warfare, would, henceforth, be, the, strategy, this, made, american, occupation, of, the, philippine, archipelago, all, the, more, difficult, over, the, next, few, years, during, the, first, four, months, of, the, guerrilla, war, the, americans, had, nearly, 500, casualties, the, philippine, army, began, staging, bloody, ambushes, and, raids, such, as, the, guerrilla, victories, at, paye, catubig, makahambus, hill, pulang, lupa, and, mabitac, at, first, it, seemed, that, the, filipinos, might, be, able, to, fight, the, americans, to, a, stalemate, and, force, them, to, withdraw, president, mckinley, considered, withdrawal, when, the, guerrilla, raids, began, on, december, 20, 1900, macarthur, who, had, succeeded, elwell, otis, as, u, s, military, governor, on, may, 5, placed, the, philippines, under, martial, law, invoking, u, s, army, general, order, 100, he, announced, that, guerrilla, abuses, would, no, longer, be, tolerated, and, outlined, the, rights, which, would, govern, the, u, s, army, s, treatment, of, guerrillas, and, civilians, in, particular, guerrillas, who, wore, no, uniform, but, peasant, dress, and, shifted, from, civilian, to, military, status, would, be, held, accountable, secret, committees, that, collected, revolutionary, taxes, and, those, accepting, u, s, protection, in, occupied, towns, while, assisting, guerrillas, would, be, treated, as, war, rebels, or, war, traitors, filipino, leaders, who, continued, to, work, towards, philippine, independence, were, deported, to, guam, the, philippine, army, continued,

united, states, telling, his, followers, to, lay, down, their, weapons, and, give, up, the, fight, let, the, stream, of, blood, cease, to, flow, let, there, be, an, end, to, tears, and, desolation, aguinaldo, said, the, lesson, which, the, war, holds, out, and, the, significance, of, which, i, realized, only, recently, leads, me, to, the, firm, conviction, that, the, complete, termination, of, hostilities, and, a, lasting, peace, are, not, only, desirable, but, also, absolutely, essential, for, the, well, being, of, the, philippines, the, capture, of, aguinaldo, dealt, a, severe, blow, to,

for, independence, they, declared, however, that, the, philippines, was, not, ready, for, it, specific, recommendations, included, the, establishment, of, civilian, control, over, manila, otis, would, have, veto, power, over, the, city, s, government, creation, of, civilian, government, as, rapidly, as, possible, especially, in, areas, already, declared, pacified, including, the, establishment, of, a, bicameral, legislature, autonomous, governments, on, the, provincial, and, municipal, levels, and, a, system, of, free, public, elementary, schools, on, november, 2, 1900, schurman, signed, the, following, statement, should, our, power, by, any, fatality, be, withdrawn, the, commission, believe, that, the, government, of, the, philippines, would, speedily, lapse, into, anarchy, which, would, excuse, if, it, did, not, necessitate, the, intervention, of, other, powers, and, the, eventual, division, of, the, islands, among, them, only, through, american, occupation, therefore, is, the, idea, of, a, free, self, governing, and, united, philippine, commonwealth, at, all, conceivable, and, the, indispensable, need, from, the, filipino, point, of, view, of, maintaining, american, sovereignty, over, the, archipelago, is, recognized, by, all, intelligent, filipinos, and, even, by, those, insurgents, who, desire, an, american, protectorate, the, latter, it, is, true, would, take, the, revenues, and, leave, us, the, responsibilities, nevertheless, they, recognize, the, indubitable, fact, that, the, filipinos, cannot, stand, alone, thus, the, welfare, of, the, filipinos, coincides, with, the, dictates, of, national, honour, in, forbidding, our, abandonment, of, the, archipelago, we, cannot, from, any, point, of, view, escape, the, responsibilities, of, government, which, our, sovereignty, entails, and, the, commission, is, strongly, persuaded, that, the, performance, of, our, national, duty, will, prove, the, greatest, blessing, to, the, peoples, of, the, philippine, islands, the, second, philippine, commission, appointed, by, president, mckinley, on, march, 16, 1900, and, headed, by, william, howard, taft, was, granted, legislative, as, well, as, limited, executive, powers, on, september, 1, the, taft, commission, began, to, exercise, legislative, functions, between, september, 1900, and, august, 1902, it, issued, 499, laws, the, commission, established, a, civil, service, and, a, judicial, system, that, included, a, supreme, court, and, a, legal, code, was, drawn, up, to, replace, obsolete, spanish, ordinances, the, 1901, municipal, code, provided, for, popularly, elected, presidents, vice, presidents, and, councilors, to, serve, on, municipal, boards, the, municipal, board, members, were, responsible, for, collecting, taxes, maintaining, municipal, properties, and, undertaking, necessary, construction, projects, they, also, elected, provincial, governors, some, americans, notably, william, jennings, bryan, mark, twain, andrew, carnegie, ernest, crosby, and, other, members, of, the, american, anti, imperialist, league, strongly, objected, to, the, annexation, of, the, philippines, anti, imperialist, movements, claimed, that, the, united, states, had, become, a, colonial, power, some, anti, imperialists, opposed, annexation, on, racist, grounds, among, these, was, senator, benjamin, tillman, of, south, carolina, who, feared, that, annexation, of, the, philippines, would, lead, to, an, influx, of, non, white, immigrants, into, the, united, states, others, worried, that, annexing, the, philippines, would, lead, to, the, non, white, population, having, a, say, in, the, american, government, as, news, of, atrocities, committed, in, subduing, the, philippines, arrived, in, the, united, states, support, for, the, war, flagged, mark, twain, opposed, the, war, using, his, influence, in, the, press, he, said, the, war, betrayed, the, ideals, of, american, democracy, by, not, allowing, the, filipino, people, to, choose, their, own, destiny, there, is, the, case, of, the, philippines, i, have, tried, hard, and, yet, i, cannot, for, the, life, of, me, comprehend, how, we, got, into, that, mess, perhaps, we, could, not, have, avoided, it, perhaps, it, was, inevitable, that, we, should, come, to, be, fighting, the, natives, of, those, islands, but, i, cannot, understand, it, and, have, never, been, able, to, get, at, the, bottom, of, the, origin, of, our, antagonism, to, the, natives, i, thought, we, should, act, as, their, protector, not, try, to, get, them, under, our, heel, we, were, to, relieve, them, from, spanish, tyranny, to, enable, them, to, set, up, a, government, of, their, own, and, we, were, to, stand, by, and, see, that, it, got, a, fair, trial, it, was, not, to, be, a, government, according, to, our, ideas, but, a, government, that, represented, the, feeling, of, the, majority, of, the, filipinos, a, government, according, to, filipino, ideas, that, would, have, been, a, worthy, mission, for, the, united, states, but, now, why, we, have, got, into, a, mess, a, quagmire, from, which, each, fresh, step, renders, the, difficulty, of, extrication, immensely, greater, i, m, sure, i, wish, i, could, see, what, we, were, getting, out, of, it, and, all, it, means, to, us, as, a, nation, in, a, diary, passage, twain, refers, to, american, troops, as, our, uniformed, assassins, and, describes, their, killing, of, six, hundred, helpless, and, weaponless, savages, in, the, philippines, as, a, long, and, happy, picnic, with, nothing, to, do, but, sit, in, comfort, and, fire, the, golden, rule, into, those, people, down, there, and, imagine, letters, to, write, home, to, the, admiring, families, and, pile, glory, upon, glory, some, of,

american, presence, and, other, resistance, groups, all, remained, active, fighting, for, nearly, a, decade, after, the, official, end, of, the, war, after, the, close, of, the, war, however, governor, general, taft, preferred, to, rely, on, the, philippine, constabulary, and, to, treat, this, as, a, law, enforcement, concern, thus, the, actions, of, these, remaining, guerrilla, resistance, movements, were, labeled, as, brigandage, or, banditry, and, dismissed, by, the, american, government, as, bandits, fanatics, and, cattle, rustlers, in, 1902, macario, sakay, established,
