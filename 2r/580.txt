revolutionary, groups, was, the, carbonari, a, secret, political, discussion, group, formed, in, southern, italy, early, in, the, 19th, century, after, 1815, freemasonry, in, italy, was, repressed, and, discredited, due, to, its, french, connections, a, void, was, left, that, the, carbonari, filled, with, a, movement, that, closely, resembled, freemasonry, but, with, a, commitment, to, italian, nationalism, and, no, association, with, napoleon, and, his, government, the, response, came, from, middle, class, professionals, and, businessmen, and, some, intellectuals, the, carbonari, disowned, napoleon, but, nevertheless, were, inspired, by, the, principles, of, the, french, revolution, regarding, liberty, equality, and, fraternity, they, developed, their, own, rituals, and, were, strongly, anticlerical, the, carbonari, movement, spread, across, italy, conservative, governments, feared, the, carbonari, imposing, stiff, penalties, on, men, discovered, to, be, members, nevertheless, the,

defeat, tyranny, and, to, establish, constitutional, government, although, contributing, some, service, to, the, cause, of, italian, unity, historians, such, as, cornelia, shiver, doubt, that, their, achievements, were, proportional, to, their, pretensions, many, leading, carbonari, revolutionaries, wanted, a, republic, two, of, the, most, prominent, being, giuseppe, mazzini, and, giuseppe,

amari, were, forced, into, exile, during, the, decades, that, followed, the, leader, of, the, 1821, revolutionary, movement, in, piedmont, was, santorre, di, santarosa, who, wanted, to, remove, the,

italy, began, to, experience, a, resurgence, and, a, series, of, insurrections, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, creation, of, one, nation, along, the, italian, peninsula, the, duke, of, modena, francis, iv, was, an, ambitious, man, and, he, hoped, to, become, king, of, northern, italy, by, increasing, his, territory, in, 1826, francis, made, it, clear, that, he, would, not, act, against, those, who, subverted, opposition, toward, the, unification, of, italy, encouraged, by, the, declaration, revolutionaries, in, the, region, began, to, organize, during, the, july, revolution, of,

had, promised, revolutionaries, such, as, ciro, menotti, that, he, would, intervene, if, austria, tried, to, interfere, in, italy, with, troops, fearing, he, would, lose, his, throne, louis, philippe, did, not, however, intervene, in, menotti, s, planned, uprising, the, duke, of, modena, abandoned, his, carbonari, supporters, arrested, menotti, and, other, conspirators, in, 1831, and, once, again, conquered, his, duchy, with, help, from, the, austrian, troops, menotti, was, executed, and, the, idea, of, a, revolution, centred, in, modena, faded, at, the, same, time, other, insurrections, arose, in, the, papal, legations, of, bologna, ferrara, ravenna, forl, ancona, and, perugia, these, successful, revolutions, which, adopted, the, tricolore, in, place, of, the, papal, flag, quickly, spread, to, cover, all, the, papal, legations, and, their, newly, installed, local, governments, proclaimed, the, creation, of, a, united, italian, nation, the, revolts, in, modena, and, the, papal,

klemens, von, metternich, warned, louis, philippe, that, austria, had, no, intention, of, letting, italian, matters, be, and, that, french, intervention, would, not, be, tolerated, louis, philippe, sent, a, naval, expedition, to, ancona, which, restored, papal, authority, there, and, even, arrested, italian, patriots, living, in, france, in, early, 1831, the, austrian, army, began, its, march, across, the, italian, peninsula, slowly, crushing, resistance, in, each, province, that, had, revolted, this, military, action, suppressed, much, of, the, fledgling, revolutionary, movement, in, 1844,

of, italian, unification, they, assembled, a, band, of, about, twenty, men, ready, to, sacrifice, their, lives, and, set, sail, on, their, venture, on, 12, june, 1844, four, days, later, they, landed, near, crotone, intending, to, go, to, cosenza, liberate, the, political, prisoners, and, issue, their, proclamations, tragically, for, the, bandiera, brothers, they, did, not, find, the, insurgent, band, they, were, told, awaited, them, so, they, moved, towards, la, sila, they, were, ultimately, betrayed, by, one, of, their, party, the, corsican, pietro, boccheciampe, and, by, some, peasants, who, believed, them, to, be, turkish, pirates, a, detachment, of, gendarmes, and, volunteers, were, sent, against, them, and, after, a, short, fight, the, whole, band, was, taken, prisoner, and, escorted, to, cosenza, where, a, number, of, calabrians, who, had, taken, part, in, a, previous, rising, were, also, under, arrest, the, bandiera, brothers, and, their, nine, companions, were, executed, by, firing, squad, some, accounts, state, they, cried, viva, l, italia, long, live, italy, as, they, fell, the, moral, effect, was, enormous, throughout, italy, the, action, of, the, authorities, was, universally, condemned, and, the, martyrdom, of, the, bandiera, brothers, bore, fruit, in, the, subsequent, revolutions, in, this, context, in, 1847, the, first, public, performance, of, the, song, il, canto, degli, italiani, the, italian, national, anthem, since, 1946, took, place, il, canto, degli, italiani, written, by, goffredo, mameli, set, to, music, by, michele, novaro, is,

with, the, revolutionaries, soured, him, on, the, idea, of, constitutional, government, in, november, 1848, following, the, assassination, of, his, minister, pellegrino, rossi, pius, ix, fled, just, before, giuseppe, garibaldi, and, other, patriots, arrived, in, rome, in, early, 1849, elections, were, held, for, a, constituent, assembly, which, proclaimed, a, roman, republic, on, 9, february, on, 2, february, 1849, at, a, political, rally, held, in, the, apollo, theater, a, young, roman, priest, the, abb, carlo, arduini, had, made, a, speech, in, which, he, had, declared, that, the, temporal, power, of, the, holy, see, was, a, historical, lie, a, political, imposture, and, a, religious, immorality, in, early, march, 1849, giuseppe, mazzini, arrived, in, rome, and, was, appointed, chief, minister, in, the, constitution, of, the, roman, republic, religious, freedom, was, guaranteed, by, article, 7, the, independence, of, the, pope, as, head, of, the, catholic, church, was, guaranteed, by, article, 8, of, the, principi, fondamentali, while, the, death, penalty, was, abolished, by, article, 5, and, free, public, education, was, provided, by, article, 8, of, the, titolo, i, before, the, powers, could, respond, to, the, founding, of, the, roman, republic, charles, albert, whose, army, had, been, trained, by, the, exiled, polish, general, albert, chrzanowski, renewed, the, war, with, austria, he, was, quickly, defeated, by, radetzky, at, novara, on, 23, march, 1849, charles, albert, abdicated, in, favour, of, his, son, victor, emmanuel, ii, and, piedmontese, ambitions, to, unite, italy, or, conquer, lombardy, were, for, the, moment, brought, to, an, end, the, war, ended, with, a, treaty, signed, on, 9, august, a, popular, revolt, broke, out, in, brescia, on, the, same, day, as, the, defeat, at, novara, but, was, suppressed, by, the, austrians, ten, days, later, there, remained, the, roman, and, venetian, republics, in, april, a, french, force, under, charles, oudinot, was, sent, to, rome, apparently, the, french, first, wished, to, mediate, between, the, pope, and, his, subjects, but, soon, the, french, were, determined, to, restore, the, pope, after, a, two, month, siege, rome, capitulated, on, 29, june, 1849, and, the, pope, was, restored, garibaldi, and, mazzini, once, again, fled, into, exile, in, 1850, garibaldi, went, to, new, york, city, meanwhile, the, austrians, besieged, venice, which, was, defended, by, a, volunteer, army, led, by, daniele, manin, and, guglielmo, pepe, who, were, forced, to, surrender, on, 24, august, pro, independence, fighters, were, hanged, en, masse, in, belfiore, while, the, austrians, moved, to, restore, order, in, central, italy, restoring, the, princes, who, had, been, expelled, and, re, establishing, papal, control, over, the, legations, the, revolutions, were, thus, completely, crushed, morale, was, of, course, badly, weakened, but, the, dream, of, risorgimento, did, not, die, instead, the, italian, patriots, learned, some, lessons, that, made, them, much, more, effective, at, the, next, opportunity, in, 1860, military, weakness, was, glaring, as, the, small, italian, states, were, completely, outmatched, by, france, and, austria, france, was, a, potential, ally, and, the, patriots, realized, they, had, to, focus, all, their, attention, on, expelling, austria, first, with, a, willingness, to, give, the, french, whatever, they, wanted, in, return, for, essential, military, intervention, as, a, result, of, this, france, received, nice, and, savoy, in, 1860, secondly, the, patriots, realized, that, the, pope, was, an, enemy, and, could, never, be, the, leader, of, a, united, italy, thirdly, they, realized, that, republicanism, was, too, weak, a, force, unification, had, to, be, based, on, a, strong, monarchy, and, in, practice, that, meant, reliance, on, piedmont, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, under, king, victor, emmanuel, ii, 1820, 1878, of, the, house, of, savoy, camillo, benso, count, of, cavour, 1810, 1861, provided, critical, leadership, he, was, a, modernizer, interested, in, agrarian, improvements, banks, railways, and, free, trade, he, opened, a, newspaper, as, soon, as, censorship, allowed, it, il, risorgimento, called, for, the, independence, of, italy, a, league, of, italian, princes, and, moderate, reforms, he, had, the, ear, of, the, king, and, in, 1852, became, prime, minister, he, ran, an, efficient, active, government, promoting, rapid, economic, modernization, while, upgrading, the, administration, of, the, army, and, the, financial, and, legal, systems, he, sought, out, support, from, patriots, across, italy, in, 1855, the, kingdom, became, an, ally, of, britain, and, france, in, the, crimean, war, which, gave, cavour, s, diplomacy, legitimacy, in, the, eyes, of, the, great, powers, in, 1857, carlo, pisacane, an, aristocrat, from, naples, who, had, embraced, mazzini, s, ideas, decided, to, provoke, a, rising, in, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, his, small, force, landed, on, the, island, of, ponza, it, overpowered, guards, and, liberated, hundreds, of, prisoners, in, sharp, contrast, to, his, hypothetical, expectations, there, was, no, local, uprising, and, the, invaders, were, quickly, overpowered, pisacane, was, killed, by, angry, locals, who, suspected, he, was, leading, a, romani, band, trying, to, steal, their, food, the, second, war, of, italian, independence, began, in, april, 1859, when, the, sardinian, prime, minister, count, cavour, found, an, ally, in, napoleon, iii, napoleon, iii, signed, a, secret, alliance, and, cavour, provoked, austria, with, military, maneuvers, and, eventually, led, to, the, war, in, april, 1859, cavour, called, for, volunteers, to, enlist, in, the, italian, liberation, the, austrians, planned, to, use, their, army, to, beat, the, sardinians, before, the, french, could, come, to, their, aid, austria, had, an, army, of, 140, 000, men, while, the, sardinians, had, a, mere, 70, 000, men, by, comparison, however, the, austrians, numerical, strength, was, outweighed, by, an, ineffectual, leadership, appointed, by, the, emperor, on, the, basis, of, noble, lineage, rather, than, military, competency, their, army, was, slow, to, enter, piedmont, taking, almost, ten, days, to, travel, the, 80, kilometres, 50, mi, to, turin, by, this, time, the, french, had, reinforced, the, sardinians, so, the, austrians, retreated, the, austrians, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, magenta, on, 4, june, and, pushed, back, to, lombardy, napoleon, iii, s, plans, worked, and, at, the, battle, of, solferino, france, and, sardinia, defeated, austria, and, forced, negotiations, at, the, same, time, in, the, northern, part, of, lombardy, the, italian, volunteers, known, as, the, hunters, of, the, alps, led, by, giuseppe, garibaldi, defeated, the, austrians, at, varese, and, como, on, 12, july, the, armistice, of, villafranca, was, signed, the, settlement, by, which, lombardy, was, annexed, to, sardinia, left, austria, in, control, of, the, veneto, and, mantua, the, final, arrangement, was, ironed, out, by, back, room, deals, this, was, because, neither, france, austria, nor, sardinia, wanted, to, risk, another, battle, and, could, not, handle, further, fighting, all, of, the, sides, were, eventually, unhappy, with, the, outcome, of, the, second, war, of, italian, unification, and, expected, another, conflict, in, the, future, in, fact, napoleon, iii, and, cavour, were, mutually, indebted, the, first, because, he, had, withdrawn, from, the, second, italian, war, of, independence, before, the, expected, conquest, of, venice, the, second, because, he, had, allowed, the, uprisings, to, spread, to, the, territories, of, central, northern, italy, thus, going, beyond, what, was, agreed, with, the, plombi, res, agreement, sardinia, annexed, lombardy, from, austria, it, later, occupied, and, annexed, the, united, provinces, of, central, italy, consisting, of, the, grand, duchy, of, tuscany, the, duchy, of, parma, the, duchy, of, modena, and, reggio, and, the, papal, legations, on, 22, march, 1860, sardinia, handed, savoy, and, nice, over, to, france, at, the, treaty, of, turin, a, decision, that, was, the, consequence, of, the, plombi, res, agreement, on, 24, march, 1860, an, event, that, caused, the, ni, ard, exodus, which, was, the, emigration, of, a, quarter, of, the, ni, ard, italians, to, italy, giuseppe, garibaldi, was, elected, in, 1871, in, nice, at, the, national, assembly, where, he, tried, to, promote, the, annexation, of, his, hometown, to, the, newborn, italian, unitary, state, but, he, was, prevented, from, speaking, because, of, this, denial, between, 1871, and, 1872, there, were, riots, in, nice, promoted, by, the, garibaldini, and, called, ni, ard, vespers, which, demanded, the, annexation, of, the, city, and, its, area, to, italy, fifteen, nice, people, who, participated, in, the, rebellion, were, tried, and, sentenced, thus, by, early, 1860, only, five, states, remained, in, italy, the, austrians, in, venetia, the, papal, states, now, minus, the, legations, the, new, expanded, kingdom, of, piedmont, sardinia, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, and, san, marino, francis, ii, of, the, two, sicilies, the, son, and, successor, of, ferdinand, ii, the, infamous, king, bomba, had, a, well, organized, army, of, 150, 000, men, but, his, father, s, tyranny, had, inspired, many, secret, societies, and, the, kingdom, s, swiss, mercenaries, were, unexpectedly, recalled, home, under, the, terms, of, a, new, swiss, law, that, forbade, swiss, citizens, to, serve, as, mercenaries, this, left, francis, with, only, his, mostly, unreliable, native, troops, it, was, a, critical, opportunity, for, the, unification, movement, in, april, 1860, separate, insurrections, began, in, messina, and, palermo, in, sicily, both, of, which, had, demonstrated, a, history, of, opposing, neapolitan, rule, these, rebellions, were, easily, suppressed, by, loyal, troops, in, the, meantime, giuseppe, garibaldi, a, native, of, nice, was, deeply, resentful, of, the, french, annexation, of, his, home, city, he, hoped, to, use, his, supporters, to, regain, the, territory, cavour, terrified, of, garibaldi, provoking, a, war, with, france, persuaded, garibaldi, to, instead, use, his, forces, in, the, sicilian, rebellions, on, 6, may, 1860, garibaldi, and, his, cadre, of, about, a, thousand, italian, volunteers, called, i, mille, steamed, from, quarto, near, genoa, and, after, a, stop, in, talamone, on, 11, may, landed, near, marsala, on, the, west, coast, of, sicily, near, salemi, garibaldi, s, army, attracted, scattered, bands, of, rebels, and, the, combined, forces, defeated, the, army, of, the, two, sicilies, at, the, battle, of, calatafimi, on, 13, may, within, three, days, the, invading, force, had, swelled, to, 4, 000, men, on, 14, may, garibaldi, proclaimed, himself, dictator, of, sicily, in, the, name, of, victor, emmanuel, after, waging, various, successful, but, hard, fought, battles, garibaldi, advanced, upon, the, sicilian, capital, of, palermo, announcing, his, arrival, by, beacon, fires, kindled, at, night, on, 27, may, the, force, began, the, siege, of, palermo, while, a, mass, uprising, of, street, and, barricade, fighting, broke, out, within, the, city, with, palermo, deemed, insurgent, neapolitan, general, ferdinando, lanza, arriving, in, sicily, with, some, 25, 000, troops, furiously, bombarded, palermo, nearly, to, ruins, with, the, intervention, of, a, british, admiral, an, armistice, was, declared, leading, to, the, neapolitan, troops, departure, and, surrender, of, the, town, to, garibaldi, and, his, much, smaller, army, this, resounding, success, demonstrated, the, weakness, of, the, neapolitan, government, garibaldi, s, fame, spread, and, many, italians, began, to, consider, him, a, national, hero, doubt, confusion, and, dismay, overtook, the, neapolitan, court, the, king, hastily, summoned, his, ministry, and, offered, to, restore, an, earlier, constitution, but, these, efforts, failed, to, rebuild, the, people, s, trust, in, bourbon, governance, six, weeks, after, the, surrender, of, palermo, garibaldi, attacked, messina, within, a, week, its, citadel, surrendered, having, conquered, sicily, garibaldi, proceeded, to, the, mainland, crossing, the, strait, of, messina, with, the, neapolitan, fleet, at, hand, the, garrison, at, reggio, calabria, promptly, surrendered, as, he, marched, northward, the, populace, everywhere, hailed, him, and, military, resistance, faded, on, 18, and, 21, august, the, people, of, basilicata, and, apulia, two, regions, of, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, independently, declared, their, annexation, to, the, kingdom, of, italy, at, the, end, of, august, garibaldi, was, at, cosenza, and, on, 5, september, at, eboli, near, salerno, meanwhile, naples, had, declared, a, state, of, siege, and, on, 6, september, the, king, gathered, the, 4, 000, troops, still, faithful, to, him, and, retreated, over, the, river, volturno, the, next, day, garibaldi, with, a, few, followers, entered, by, train, into, naples, where, the, people, openly, welcomed, him, although, garibaldi, had, easily, taken, the, capital, the, neapolitan, army, had, not, joined, the, rebellion, en, masse, holding, firm, along, the, river, volturno, garibaldi, s, irregular, bands, of, about, 25, 000, men, could, not, drive, away, the, king, or, take, the, fortresses, of, capua, and, gaeta, without, the, help, of, the, royal, sardinian, army, the, sardinian, army, however, could, only, arrive, by, traversing, the, papal, states, which, extended, across, the, entire, center, of, the, peninsula, ignoring, the, political, will, of, the, holy, see, garibaldi, announced, his, intent, to, proclaim, a, kingdom, of, italy, from, rome, the, capital, city, of, pope, pius, ix, seeing, this, as, a, threat, to, the, domain, of, the, catholic, church, pius, threatened, excommunication, for, those, who, supported, such, an, effort, afraid, that, garibaldi, would, attack, rome, catholics, worldwide, sent, money, and, volunteers, for, the, papal, army, which, was, commanded, by, general, louis, lamorici, re, a, french, exile, the, settling, of, the, peninsular, standoff, now, rested, with, napoleon, iii, if, he, let, garibaldi, have, his, way, garibaldi, would, probably, end, the, temporal, sovereignty, of, the, pope, and, make, rome, the, capital, of, italy, napoleon, however, may, have, arranged, with, cavour, to, let, the, king, of, sardinia, free, to, take, possession, of, naples, umbria, and, the, other, provinces, provided, that, rome, and, the, patrimony, of, saint, peter, were, left, intact, it, was, in, this, situation, that, a, sardinian, force, of, two, army, corps, under, generals, manfredo, fanti, and, enrico, cialdini, marched, to, the, frontier, of, the, papal, states, its, objective, being, not, rome, but, naples, the, papal, troops, under, lamorici, re, advanced, against, cialdini, but, were, quickly, defeated, at, the, battle, of, castelfidardo, and, besieged, in, the, fortress, of, ancona, finally, surrendering, on, 29, september, on, 9, october, victor, emmanuel, arrived, and, took, command, there, was, no, longer, a, papal, army, to, oppose, him, and, the, march, southward, proceeded, unopposed, garibaldi, distrusted, the, pragmatic, cavour, since, cavour, was, the, man, ultimately, responsible, for, orchestrating, the, french, annexation, of, the, city, of, nice, which, was, his, birthplace, nevertheless, he, accepted, the, command, of, victor, emmanuel, when, the, king, entered, sessa, aurunca, at, the, head, of, his, army, garibaldi, willingly, handed, over, his, dictatorial, power, after, greeting, victor, emmanuel, in, teano, with, the, title, of, king, of, italy, garibaldi, entered, naples, riding, beside, the, king, garibaldi, then, retired, to, the, island, of, caprera, while, the, remaining, work, of, unifying, the, peninsula, was, left, to, victor, emmanuel, the, progress, of, the, sardinian, army, compelled, francis, ii, to, give, up, his, line, along, the, river, and, he, eventually, took, refuge, with, his, best, troops, in, the, fortress, of, gaeta, his, courage, boosted, by, his, resolute, young, wife, queen, marie, sophie, francis, mounted, a, stubborn, defence, that, lasted, three, months, but, european, allies, refused, to, provide, him, with, aid, food, and, munitions, became, scarce, and, disease, set, in, so, the, garrison, was, forced, to, surrender, nonetheless, ragtag, groups, of, neapolitans, loyal, to, francis, fought, on, against, the, italian, government, for, years, to, come, the, fall, of, gaeta, brought, the, unification, movement, to, the, brink, of, fruition, only, lazio, and, venetia, remained, to, be, added, on, 18, february, 1861, victor, emmanuel, assembled, the, deputies, of, the, first, italian, parliament, in, turin, on, 17, march, 1861, the, parliament, proclaimed, victor, emmanuel, king, of, italy, and, on, 27, march, 1861, rome, was, declared, capital, of, italy, although, it, was, not, yet, in, the, new, kingdom, borrowing, from, the, old, latin, title, pater, patriae, of, the, roman, emperors, the, italians, gave, to, king, victor, emmanuel, ii, the, epithet, of, father, of, the, fatherland, italian, padre, della, patria, three, months, later, cavour, died, having, seen, his, life, s, work, nearly, completed, when, he, was, given, the, last, rites, cavour, purportedly, said, italy, is, made, all, is, safe, the, disapproval, of, the, various, european, states, culminated, in, the, direct, participation, of, the, sardinian, army, in, the, expedition, of, the, thousand, in, reaction, spain, and, the, russian, empire, interrupted, diplomatic, relations, with, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, while, the, austrian, empire, which, had, not, maintained, relations, with, this, country, since, 1859, after, the, second, italian, war, of, independence, sent, its, troops, to, the, mincio, border, france, made, no, hostile, statements, but, recalled, its, ambassador, queen, victoria, and, her, prime, minister, john, russell, convinced, the, kingdom, of, prussia, not, to, hinder, the, ongoing, process, of, italian, unification, on, 26, october, 1860, the, same, day, as, the, meeting, in, teano, between, the, king, and, garibaldi, austria, organized, a, congress, in, warsaw, to, apply, measures, against, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, without, success, held, back, by, this, crisis, cavour, was, unable, to, be, present, at, teano, after, the, creation, of, the, kingdom, of, italy, the, united, kingdom, and, the, swiss, confederation, were, the, first, to, recognize, the, new, state, 30, march, 1861, followed, by, the, united, states, on, 13, april, france, negotiated, the, presence, of, french, troops, in, rome, and, recognized, the, kingdom, of, italy, on, 15, june, shortly, after, cavour, s, death, it, will, then, be, portugal, s, turn, on, 27, june, followed, by, greece, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, scandinavian, countries, the, recognition, of, the, netherlands, and, belgium, occurred, in, two, phases, they, recognized, the, new, title, of, victor, emmanuel, ii, in, july, then, the, kingdom, in, november, after, a, long, clash, between, conservatives, and, liberals, in, the, belgian, parliament, over, the, latter, mazzini, was, discontented, with, the, perpetuation, of, monarchical, government, and, continued, to, agitate, for, a, republic, with, the, motto, free, from, the, alps, to, the, adriatic, the, unification, movement, set, its, gaze, on, rome, and, venice, there, were, obstacles, however, a, challenge, against, the, pope, s, temporal, dominion, was, viewed, with, profound, distrust, by, catholics, around, the, world, and, there, were, french, troops, stationed, in, rome, victor, emmanuel, was, wary, of, the, international, repercussions, of, attacking, the, papal, states, and, discouraged, his, subjects, from, participating, in, revolutionary, ventures, with, such, intentions, nonetheless, garibaldi, believed, that, the, government, would, support, him, if, he, attacked, rome, frustrated, at, inaction, by, the, king, and, bristling, over, perceived, snubs, he, came, out, of, retirement, to, organize, a, new, venture, in, june, 1862, he, sailed, from, genoa, and, landed, again, at, palermo, where, he, gathered, volunteers, for, the, campaign, under, the, slogan, o, roma, o, morte, either, rome, or, death, the, garrison, of, messina, loyal, to, the, king, s, instructions, barred, their, passage, to, the, mainland, garibaldi, s, force, now, numbering, two, thousand, turned, south, and, set, sail, from, catania, garibaldi, declared, that, he, would, enter, rome, as, a, victor, or, perish, beneath, its, walls, he, landed, at, melito, on, 14, august, and, marched, at, once, into, the, calabrian, mountains, far, from, supporting, this, endeavour, the, italian, government, was, quite, disapproving, general, cialdini, dispatched, a, division, of, the, regular, army, under, colonel, pallavicino, against, the, volunteer, bands, on, 28, august, the, two, forces, met, at, aspromonte, one, of, the, regulars, fired, a, chance, shot, and, several, volleys, followed, but, garibaldi, forbade, his, men, to, return, fire, on, fellow, subjects, of, the, kingdom, of, italy, the, volunteers, suffered, several, casualties, and, garibaldi, himself, was, wounded, many, were, taken, prisoner, garibaldi, was, taken, by, steamer, to, varignano, where, he, was, honorably, imprisoned, for, a, time, but, finally, released, meanwhile, victor, emmanuel, sought, a, safer, means, to, the, acquisition, of, the, remaining, papal, territory, he, negotiated, with, the, emperor, napoleon, for, the, removal, of, the, french, troops, from, rome, through, a, treaty, they, agreed, to, the, september, convention, in, september, 1864, by, which, napoleon, agreed, to, withdraw, the, troops, within, two, years, the, pope, was, to, expand, his, own, army, during, that, time, so, as, to, be, self, sufficient, in, december, 1866, the, last, of, the, french, troops, departed, from, rome, in, spite, of, the, efforts, of, the, pope, to, retain, them, by, their, withdrawal, italy, excluding, venetia, and, savoy, was, freed, from, the, presence, of, foreign, soldiers, the, seat, of, government, was, moved, in, 1865, from, turin, the, old, sardinian, capital, to, florence, this, arrangement, created, such, disturbances, in, turin, that, the, king, was, forced, to, leave, that, city, hastily, for, his, new, capital, in, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, austria, contested, with, prussia, the, position, of, leadership, among, the, german, states, the, kingdom, of, italy, seized, the, opportunity, to, capture, venetia, from, austrian, rule, and, allied, itself, with, prussia, austria, tried, to, persuade, the, italian, government, to, accept, venetia, in, exchange, for, non, intervention, however, on, 8, april, italy, and, prussia, signed, an, agreement, that, supported, italy, s, acquisition, of, venetia, and, on, 20, june, italy, issued, a, declaration, of, war, on, austria, within, the, context, of, italian, unification, the, austro, prussian, war, is, called, the, third, independence, war, after, the, first, 1848, and, the, second, 1859, victor, emmanuel, hastened, to, lead, an, army, across, the, mincio, to, the, invasion, of, venetia, while, garibaldi, was, to, invade, the, tyrol, with, his, hunters, of, the, alps, the, italian, army, encountered, the, austrians, at, custoza, on, 24, june, and, suffered, a, defeat, on, 20, july, the, regia, marina, was, defeated, in, the, battle, of, lissa, the, following, day, garibaldi, s, volunteers, defeated, an, austrian, force, in, the, battle, of, bezzecca, and, moved, toward, trento, meanwhile, prussian, minister, president, otto, von, bismarck, saw, that, his, own, ends, in, the, war, had, been, achieved, and, signed, an, armistice, with, austria, on, 27, july, italy, followed, officially, laying, down, its, arms, on, 12, august, garibaldi, was, recalled, from, his, successful, march, and, resigned, with, a, brief, telegram, reading, only, obbedisco, i, obey, prussia, s, success, on, the, northern, front, obliged, austria, to, cede, venetia, present, day, veneto, and, parts, of, friuli, and, the, city, of, mantua, the, last, remnant, of, the, quadrilatero, under, the, terms, of, a, peace, treaty, signed, in, vienna, on, 12, october, emperor, franz, joseph, had, already, agreed, to, cede, venetia, to, napoleon, iii, in, exchange, for, non, intervention, in, the, austro, prussian, war, and, thus, napoleon, ceded, venetia, to, italy, on, 19, october, in, exchange, for, the, earlier, italian, acquiescence, to, the, french, annexation, of, savoy, and, nice, in, the, treaty, of, vienna, it, was, written, that, the, annexation, of, venetia, would, have, become, effective, only, after, a, referendum, taken, on, 21, and, 22, october, to, let, the, venetian, people, express, their, will, about, being, annexed, or, not, to, the, kingdom, of, italy, historians, suggest, that, the, referendum, in, venetia, was, held, under, military, pressure, as, a, mere, 0, 01, of, voters, 69, out, of, more, than, 642, 000, ballots, voted, against, the, annexation, austrian, forces, put, up, some, opposition, to, the, invading, italians, to, little, effect, victor, emmanuel, entered, venice, and, venetian, land, and, performed, an, act, of, homage, in, the, piazza, san, marco, the, national, party, with, garibaldi, at, its, head, still, aimed, at, the, possession, of, rome, as, the, historic, capital, of, the, peninsula, in, 1867, garibaldi, made, a, second, attempt, to, capture, rome, but, the, papal, army, strengthened, with, a, new, french, auxiliary, force, defeated, his, poorly, armed, volunteers, at, mentana, subsequently, a, french, garrison, remained, in, civitavecchia, until, august, 1870, when, it, was, recalled, following, the, outbreak, of, the, franco, prussian, war, before, the, defeat, at, mentana, on, 3, november, 1867, enrico, cairoli, his, brother, giovanni, and, 70, companions, had, made, a, daring, attempt, to, take, rome, the, group, had, embarked, in, terni, and, floated, down, the, tiber, their, arrival, in, rome, was, to, coincide, with, an, uprising, inside, the, city, on, 22, october, 1867, the, revolutionaries, inside, rome, seized, control, of, the, capitoline, hill, and, of, piazza, colonna, unfortunately, for, the, cairoli, and, their, companions, by, the, time, they, arrived, at, villa, glori, on, the, northern, outskirts, of, rome, the, uprising, had, already, been, suppressed, during, the, night, of, 22, october, 1867, the, group, was, surrounded, by, papal, zouaves, and, giovanni, was, severely, wounded, enrico, was, mortally, wounded, and, bled, to, death, in, giovanni, s, arms, with, cairoli, dead, command, was, assumed, by, giovanni, tabacchi, who, had, retreated, with, the, remaining, volunteers, into, the, villa, where, they, continued, to, fire, at, the, papal, soldiers, these, also, retreated, in, the, evening, to, rome, the, survivors, retreated, to, the, positions, of, those, led, by, garibaldi, on, the, italian, border, at, the, summit, of, villa, glori, near, the, spot, where, enrico, died, there, is, a, plain, white, column, dedicated, to, the, cairoli, brothers, and, their, 70, companions, about, 200, meters, to, the, right, from, the, terrazza, del, pincio, there, is, a, bronze, monument, of, giovanni, holding, the, dying, enrico, in, his, arm, a, plaque, lists, the, names, of, their, companions, giovanni, never, recovered, from, his, wounds, and, from, the, tragic, events, of, 1867, according, to, an, eyewitness, when, giovanni, died, on, 11, september, 1869, in, the, last, moments, he, had, a, vision, of, garibaldi, and, seemed, to, greet, him, with, enthusiasm, i, heard, so, says, a, friend, who, was, present, him, say, three, times, the, union, of, the, french, to, the, papal, political, supporters, was, the, terrible, fact, he, was, thinking, about, mentana, he, called, enrico, many, times, that, he, might, help, him, then, he, said, but, we, will, certainly, win, we, will, go, to, rome, in, july, 1870, the, franco, prussian, war, began, in, early, august, the, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, recalled, his, garrison, from, rome, thus, no, longer, providing, protection, to, the, papal, state, widespread, public, demonstrations, illustrated, the, demand, that, the, italian, government, take, rome, the, italian, government, took, no, direct, action, until, the, collapse, of, the, second, french, empire, at, the, battle, of, sedan, king, victor, emmanuel, ii, sent, count, gustavo, ponza, di, san, martino, to, pius, ix, with, a, personal, letter, offering, a, face, saving, proposal, that, would, have, allowed, the, peaceful, entry, of, the, italian, army, into, rome, under, the, guise, of, offering, protection, to, the, pope, the, papacy, however, exhibited, something, less, than, enthusiasm, for, the, plan, the, pope, s, reception, of, san, martino, 10, september, 1870, was, unfriendly, pius, ix, allowed, violent, outbursts, to, escape, him, throwing, the, king, s, letter, upon, the, table, he, exclaimed, fine, loyalty, you, are, all, a, set, of, vipers, of, whited, sepulchres, and, wanting, in, faith, he, was, perhaps, alluding, to, other, letters, received, from, the, king, after, growing, calmer, he, exclaimed, i, am, no, prophet, nor, son, of, a, prophet, but, i, tell, you, you, will, never, enter, rome, san, martino, was, so, mortified, that, he, left, the, next, day, the, royal, italian, army, commanded, by, general, raffaele, cadorna, crossed, the, papal, frontier, on, 11, september, and, advanced, slowly, toward, rome, hoping, that, a, peaceful, entry, could, be, negotiated, the, italian, army, reached, the, aurelian, walls, on, 19, september, and, placed, rome, under, a, state, of, siege, although, now, convinced, of, his, unavoidable, defeat, pius, ix, remained, intransigent, to, the, bitter, end, and, forced, his, troops, to, put, up, a, token, resistance, on, 20, september, after, a, cannonade, of, three, hours, had, breached, the, aurelian, walls, at, porta, pia, the, bersaglieri, entered, rome, and, marched, down, via, pia, which, was, subsequently, renamed, via, xx, settembre, forty, nine, italian, soldiers, and, four, officers, and, nineteen, papal, troops, died, rome, and, latium, were, annexed, to, the, kingdom, of, italy, after, a, plebiscite, held, on, 2, october, the, results, of, this, plebiscite, were, accepted, by, decree, of, 9, october, initially, the, italian, government, had, offered, to, let, the, pope, keep, the, leonine, city, under, the, law, of, guarantees, but, the, pope, rejected, the, offer, because, acceptance, would, have, been, an, implied, endorsement, of, the, legitimacy, of, the, italian, kingdom, s, rule, over, his, former, domain, pius, ix, declared, himself, a, prisoner, in, the, vatican, although, he, was, not, actually, restrained, from, coming, and, going, rather, being, deposed, and, stripped, of, much, of, his, former, power, also, removed, a, measure, of, personal, protection, if, he, had, walked, the, streets, of, rome, he, might, have, been, in, danger, from, political, opponents, who, had, formerly, kept, their, views, private, officially, the, capital, was, not, moved, from, florence, to, rome, until, july, 1871, historian, raffaele, de, cesare, made, the, following, observations, about, italian, unification, the, roman, question, was, the, stone, tied, to, napoleon, s, feet, that, dragged, him, into, the, abyss, he, never, forgot, even, in, august, 1870, a, month, before, sedan, that, he, was, a, sovereign, of, a, catholic, country, that, he, had, been, made, emperor, and, was, supported, by, the, votes, of, the, conservatives, and, the, influence, of, the, clergy, and, that, it, was, his, supreme, duty, not, to, abandon, the, pontiff, for, twenty, years, napoleon, iii, had, been, the, true, sovereign, of, rome, where, he, had, many, friends, and, relations, without, him, the, temporal, power, would, never, have, been, reconstituted, nor, being, reconstituted, would, have, endured, unification, was, achieved, entirely, in, terms, of, piedmont, s, interests, martin, clark, says, it, was, piedmontization, all, around, cavour, died, unexpectedly, in, june, 1861, at, 50, and, most, of, the, many, promises, that, he, made, to, regional, authorities, to, induce, them, to, join, the, newly, unified, italian, kingdom, were, ignored, the, new, kingdom, of, italy, was, structured, by, renaming, the, old, kingdom, of, sardinia, and, annexing, all, the, new, provinces, into, its, structures, the, first, king, was, victor, emmanuel, ii, who, kept, his, old, title, national, and, regional, officials, were, all, appointed, by, piedmont, a, few, regional, leaders, succeeded, to, high, positions, in, the, new, national, government, but, the, top, bureaucratic, and, military, officials, were, mostly, piedmontese, the, national, capital, was, briefly, moved, to, florence, and, finally, to, rome, one, of, the, cases, of, piedmont, losing, out, however, piedmontese, tax, rates, and, regulations, diplomats, and, officials, were, imposed, on, all, of, italy, the, constitution, was, piedmont, s, old, constitution, the, document, was, generally, liberal, and, was, welcomed, by, liberal, elements, however, its, anticlerical, provisions, were, resented, in, the, pro, clerical, regions, in, places, such, as, around, venice, rome, and, naples, as, well, as, the, island, of, sicily, cavour, had, promised, there, would, be, regional, and, municipal, local, governments, but, all, the, promises, were, broken, in, 1861, the, first, decade, of, the, kingdom, saw, savage, insurrections, in, sicily, and, in, the, naples, region, hearder, claimed, that, failed, efforts, to, protest, unification, involved, a, mixture, of, spontaneous, peasant, movement, and, a, bourbon, clerical, reaction, directed, by, the, old, authorities, the, pope, lost, rome, in, 1870, and, ordered, the, catholic, church, not, to, co, operate, with, the, new, government, a, decision, fully, reversed, only, in, 1929, most, people, for, risorgimento, had, wanted, strong, provinces, but, they, got, a, strong, central, state, instead, the, inevitable, long, run, results, were, a, severe, weakness, of, national, unity, and, a, politicized, system, based, on, mutually, hostile, regional, violence, such, factors, remain, in, the, 21st, century, from, the, spring, of, 1860, to, the, summer, of, 1861, a, major, challenge, that, the, piedmontese, parliament, faced, on, national, unification, was, how, they, should, govern, and, control, the, southern, regions, of, the, country, that, were, frequently, represented, and, described, by, northern, italian, correspondents, as, corrupt, barbaric, and, uncivilized, in, response, to, the, depictions, of, southern, italy, the, piedmontese, parliament, had, to, decide, whether, it, should, investigate, the, southern, regions, to, better, understand, the, social, and, political, situations, there, or, it, should, establish, jurisdiction, and, order, by, using, mostly, force, the, dominance, of, letters, sent, from, the, northern, italian, correspondents, that, deemed, southern, italy, to, be, so, far, from, the, ideas, of, progress, and, civilization, ultimately, induced, the, piedmontese, parliament, to, choose, the, latter, course, of, action, which, effectively, illustrated, the, intimate, connection, between, representation, and, rule, in, essence, the, northern, italians, representation, of, the, south, as, a, land, of, barbarism, variously, qualified, as, indecent, lacking, in, public, conscience, ignorant, superstitious, etc, provided, the, piedmontese, with, the, justification, to, rule, the, southern, regions, on, the, pretext, of, implementing, a, superior, more, civilized, piedmontese, morality, italian, unification, is, still, a, topic, of, debate, according, to, massimo, d, azeglio, centuries, of, foreign, domination, created, remarkable, differences, in, italian, society, and, the, role, of, the, newly, formed, government, was, to, face, these, differences, and, to, create, a, unified, italian, society, still, today, the, most, famous, quote, of, massimo, d, azeglio, is, l, italia, fatta, restano, da, fare, gli, italiani, italy, has, been, made, now, it, remains, to, make, italians, the, economist, and, politician, francesco, saverio, nitti, criticized, the, newly, created, state, for, not, considering, the, substantial, economic, differences, between, northern, italy, a, free, market, economy, and, southern, italy, a, state, protectionist, economy, when, integrating, the, two, when, the, kingdom, of, italy, extended, the, free, market, economy, to, the, rest, of, the, country, the, south, s, economy, collapsed, under, the, weight, of, the, north, s, nitti, contended, that, this, change, should, have, been, much, more, gradual, in, order, to, allow, the, birth, of, an, adequate, entrepreneurial, class, able, to, make, strong, investments, and, initiatives, in, the, south, these, mistakes, he, felt, were, the, cause, of, the, economic, and, social, problems, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, southern, question, questione, meridionale, the, politician, historian, and, writer, gaetano, salvemini, commented, that, although, italian, unification, had, been, a, strong, opportunity, for, both, a, moral, and, economic, rebirth, of, italy, s, mezzogiorno, southern, italy, because, of, a, lack, of, understanding, and, action, on, the, part, of, politicians, corruption, and, organized, crime, flourished, in, the, south, the, marxist, theorist, antonio, gramsci, criticized, italian, unification, for, the, limited, presence, of, the, masses, in, politics, as, well, as, the, lack, of, modern, land, reform, in, italy, revisionism, of, risorgimento, produced, a, clear, radicalization, of, italy, in, the, mid, 20th, century, following, the, fall, of, the, savoy, monarchy, and, fascism, during, world, war, ii, reviews, of, the, historical, facts, concerning, italian, unification, s, successes, and, failures, continue, to, be, undertaken, by, domestic, and, foreign, academic, authors, including, denis, mack, smith, christopher, duggan, and, lucy, riall, recent, work, emphasizes, the, central, importance, of, nationalism, it, can, be, argued, that, italian, unification, was, never, truly, completed, in, the, 19th, century, even, after, the, capture, of, rome, 1871, the, final, event, of, the, unification, of, italy, many, ethnic, italian, speakers, trentino, alto, adigan, italians, savoyard, italians, corfiot, italians, ni, ard, italians, swiss, italians, corsican, italians, maltese, italians, istrian, italians, and, dalmatian, italians, remained, outside, the, borders, of, the, kingdom, of, italy, and, this, situation, created, the, italian, irredentism, the, corsican, revolutionary, pasquale, paoli, was, called, the, precursor, of, italian, irredentism, by, niccol, tommaseo, because, he, was, the, first, to, promote, the, italian, language, and, socio, culture, the, main, characteristics, of, italian, irredentism, in, his, island, paoli, wanted, the, italian, language, to, be, the, official, language, of, the, newly, founded, corsican, republic, the, term, risorgimento, refers, to, the, domestic, reorganization, of, the, stratified, italian, identity, into, a, unified, national, front, the, word, literally, means, rising, again, and, was, an, ideological, movement, which, strove, to, spark, national, pride, leading, to, political, oppositionalism, to, foreign, rule, and, influence, there, is, contention, on, its, actual, impact, in, italy, some, scholars, arguing, it, was, a, liberalizing, time, for, 19th, century, italian, culture, while, others, speculate, that, although, it, was, a, patriotic, revolution, it, only, tangibly, aided, the, upper, class, and, bourgeois, publics, without, actively, benefitting, the, lower, classes, italia, irredenta, was, an, italian, nationalist, opinion, movement, that, emerged, after, italian, unification, it, advocated, irredentism, among, the, italian, people, as, well, as, other, nationalities, who, were, willing, to, become, italian, and, as, a, movement, it, is, also, known, as, italian, irredentism, not, a, formal, organization, it, was, just, an, opinion, movement, that, claimed, that, italy, had, to, reach, its, natural, borders, meaning, that, the, country, would, need, to, incorporate, all, areas, predominantly, consisting, of, ethnic, italians, within, the, near, vicinity, outside, its, borders, similar, patriotic, and, nationalistic, ideas, were, common, in, europe, in, the, 19th, century, at, the, beginning, italian, irredentism, promoted, the, annexation, to, italy, of, territories, where, italians, formed, the, absolute, majority, of, the, population, but, retained, by, the, austrian, empire, after, the, third, italian, war, of, independence, in, 1866, during, world, war, one, the, main, irredent, lands, terre, irredente, were, considered, to, be, the, provinces, of, trento, and, trieste, and, in, a, narrow, sense, irredentists, referred, to, the, italian, patriots, living, in, these, two, areas, the, term, was, later, expanded, to, also, include, multilingual, and, multiethnic, areas, where, italians, were, a, relative, majority, or, a, substantial, minority, within, the, northern, italian, region, encompassed, by, the, alps, with, german, italian, slovene, croatian, ladin, and, istro, romanian, population, such, as, south, tyrol, istria, gorizia, and, gradisca, and, part, of, dalmatia, the, claims, were, further, extended, also, to, the, city, of, fiume, see, impresa, di, fiume, corsica, the, island, of, malta, the, county, of, nice, and, italian, switzerland, many, istrian, italians, and, dalmatian, italians, looked, with, sympathy, towards, the, risorgimento, movement, that, fought, for, the, unification, of, italy, however, after, the, third, italian, war, of, independence, 1866, when, the, veneto, and, friuli, regions, were, ceded, by, the, austrians, to, the, newly, formed, kingdom, italy, istria, and, dalmatia, remained, part, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, together, with, other, italian, speaking, areas, on, the, eastern, adriatic, this, triggered, the, gradual, rise, of, italian, irredentism, among, many, italians, in, istria, kvarner, and, dalmatia, who, demanded, the, unification, of, the, julian, march, kvarner, and, dalmatia, with, italy, the, italians, in, istria, kvarner, and, dalmatia, supported, the, italian, risorgimento, as, a, consequence, the, austrians, saw, the, italians, as, enemies, and, favored, the, slav, communities, of, istria, kvarner, and, dalmatia, during, the, meeting, of, the, council, of, ministers, of, 12, november, 1866, emperor, franz, joseph, i, of, austria, outlined, a, wide, ranging, project, aimed, at, the, germanization, or, slavization, of, the, areas, of, the, empire, with, an, italian, presence, his, majesty, expressed, the, precise, order, that, action, be, taken, decisively, against, the, influence, of, the, italian, elements, still, present, in, some, regions, of, the, crown, and, appropriately, occupying, the, posts, of, public, judicial, masters, employees, as, well, as, with, the, influence, of, the, press, work, in, south, tyrol, dalmatia, and, littoral, for, the, germanization, and, slavization, of, these, territories, according, to, the, circumstances, with, energy, and, without, any, regard, his, majesty, calls, the, central, offices, to, the, strong, duty, to, proceed, in, this, way, to, what, has, been, established, istrian, italians, were, more, than, 50, of, the, total, population, of, istria, for, centuries, while, making, up, about, a, third, of, the, population, in, 1900, dalmatia, especially, its, maritime, cities, once, had, a, substantial, local, ethnic, italian, population, dalmatian, italians, making, up, 33, of, the, total, population, of, dalmatia, in, 1803, but, this, was, reduced, to, 20, in, 1816, in, dalmatia, there, was, a, constant, decline, in, the, italian, population, in, a, context, of, repression, that, also, took, on, violent, connotations, during, this, period, austrians, carried, out, an, aggressive, anti, italian, policy, through, a, forced, slavization, of, dalmatia, according, to, austrian, census, the, dalmatian, italians, formed, 12, 5, of, the, population, in, 1865, in, the, 1910, austro, hungarian, census, istria, had, a, population, of, 57, 8, slavic, speakers, croat, and, slovene, and, 38, 1, italian, speakers, for, the, austrian, kingdom, of, dalmatia, i, e, dalmatia, the, 1910, numbers, were, 96, 2, slavic, speakers, and, 2, 8, italian, speakers, the, italian, population, in, dalmatia, was, concentrated, in, the, major, coastal, cities, in, the, city, of, split, in, 1890, there, were, 1, 969, dalmatian, italians, 12, 5, of, the, population, in, zadar, 7, 423, 64, 6, in, ibenik, 1, 018, 14, 5, in, kotor, 623, 18, 7, and, in, dubrovnik, 331, 4, 6, in, other, dalmatian, localities, according, to, austrian, censuses, dalmatian, italians, experienced, a, sudden, decrease, in, the, twenty, years, 1890, 1910, in, rab, they, went, from, 225, to, 151, in, vis, from, 352, to, 92, in, pag, from, 787, to, 23, completely, disappearing, in, almost, all, the, inland, locations, in, 1909, the, italian, language, lost, its, status, as, the, official, language, of, dalmatia, in, favor, of, croatian, only, previously, both, languages, were, recognized, thus, italian, could, no, longer, be, used, in, the, public, and, administrative, sphere, italy, entered, into, the, first, world, war, in, 1915, with, the, aim, of, completing, national, unity, for, this, reason, the, italian, intervention, in, the, first, world, war, is, also, considered, the, fourth, italian, war, of, independence, in, a, historiographical, perspective, that, identifies, in, the, latter, the, conclusion, of, the, unification, of, italy, whose, military, actions, began, during, the, revolutions, of, 1848, with, the, first, italian, war, of, independence, during, the, post, unification, era, some, italians, were, dissatisfied, with, the, current, state, of, the, italian, kingdom, since, they, wanted, the, kingdom, to, include, trieste, istria, and, other, adjacent, territories, as, well, this, italian, irredentism, succeeded, in, world, war, i, with, the, annexation, of, trieste, and, trento, with, the, respective, territories, of, julian, march, and, trentino, alto, adige, the, kingdom, of, italy, had, declared, neutrality, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, officially, because, the, triple, alliance, with, germany, and, austria, hungary, was, a, defensive, one, requiring, its, members, to, come, under, attack, first, many, italians, were, still, hostile, to, austria, s, continuing, occupation, of, ethnically, italian, areas, and, italy, chose, not, to, enter, austria, hungary, requested, italian, neutrality, while, the, triple, entente, which, included, great, britain, france, and, russia, requested, its, intervention, with, the, treaty, of, london, signed, in, april, 1915, italy, agreed, to, declare, war, against, the, central, powers, in, exchange, for, the, irredent, territories, of, friuli, trentino, and, dalmatia, see, italia, irredenta, italian, irredentism, obtained, an, important, result, after, the, first, world, war, when, italy, gained, trieste, gorizia, istria, and, the, cities, of, zara, and, pola, after, the, treaty, of, rapallo, in, 1920, some, historians, see, the, risorgimento, as, continuing, to, that, time, which, is, the, view, presented, at, the, central, museum, of, the, risorgimento, at, altare, della, patria, in, rome, but, italy, did, not, receive, other, territories, promised, by, the, treaty, of, london, such, dalmatia, so, this, outcome, was, denounced, as, a, mutilated, victory, the, rhetoric, of, mutilated, victory, was, adopted, by, benito, mussolini, and, led, to, the, rise, of, italian, fascism, becoming, a, key, point, in, the, propaganda, of, fascist, italy, historians, regard, mutilated, victory, as, a, political, myth, used, by, fascists, to, fuel, italian, imperialism, and, obscure, the, successes, of, liberal, italy, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, during, the, second, world, war, after, the, axis, attack, on, yugoslavia, italy, created, the, governatorate, of, dalmatia, from, 1941, to, september, 1943, so, the, kingdom, of, italy, annexed, temporarily, split, italian, spalato, kotor, cattaro, and, most, of, coastal, dalmatia, from, 1942, to, 1943, corsica, and, nice, italian, nizza, were, temporarily, annexed, to, the, kingdom, of, italy, nearly, fulfilling, in, those, years, the, ambitions, of, italian, irredentism, for, its, avowed, purpose, the, movement, had, the, emancipation, of, all, italian, lands, still, subject, to, foreign, rule, after, italian, unification, the, irredentists, took, language, as, the, test, of, the, alleged, italian, nationality, of, the, countries, they, proposed, to, emancipate, which, were, trentino, trieste, dalmatia, istria, gorizia, ticino, nice, nizza, corsica, and, malta, austria, hungary, promoted, croatian, interests, in, dalmatia, and,
