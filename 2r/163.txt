destruction, of, the, city, by, fire, although, evidence, for, the, event, has, only, been, found, outside, of, the, so, called, temple, of, the, rock, and, in, the, area, around, palace, e, on, the, acropolis, the, reason, for, the, destruction, is, not, known, according, to, astour, it, could, have, been, the, result, of, a, hurrian, invasion, c, 2030, bc, led, by, the, former, eblaite, vassal, city, of, ikinkalis, the, destruction, of, ebla, is, mentioned, in, the, fragmentary, hurro, hittite, legendary, epic, song, of, release, discovered, in, 1983, which, astour, considers, as, describing, the, destruction, of, the, second, kingdom, in, the, epic, an, eblaite, assembly, led, by, a, man, called, zazalla, prevents, king, meki, from, showing, mercy, to, prisoners, from, ebla,

the, mekim, of, ebla, a, basalt, votive, statue, bearing, ibbit, lim, s, inscription, was, discovered, in, 1968, this, helped, to, identify, the, site, of, tell, mardikh, with, the, ancient, kingdom, ebla, the, name, of, the, king, is, amorite, in, the, view, of, pettinato, it, is, therefore, probable, the, inhabitants, of, third, kingdom, ebla, were, predominantly, amorites, as, were, most, of,

estimated, that, around, 40, 000, persons, contributed, to, this, system, but, in, general, and, unlike, in, mesopotamia, land, stayed, in, the, hands, of, villages, which, paid, an, annual, share, to, the, palace, agriculture, was, mainly, pastoral, large, herds, of, cattle, were, managed, by, the, palace, the, city, s, inhabitants, owned, around, 140, 000, head, of, sheep, and, goats, and, 9,

articles, of, trade, were, probably, timber, from, the, nearby, mountains, and, textiles, handicrafts, also, appear, to, have, been, a, major, export, evidenced, by, the, quantity, of, artifacts, recovered, from, the, palaces, of, the, city, ebla, possessed, a, wide, commercial, network, reaching, as, far, as, modern, day, afghanistan, it, shipped, textiles, to, cyprus, possibly, through, the, port, of, ugarit, but, most, of, its, trade, seems, to, have, been, directed, by, river, boat, towards, mesopotamia, chiefly, kish, the, main, palace, g, was, found, to, contain, artifacts, dating, from, ancient, egypt, bearing, the, names, of, the, pharaohs, khafre, and, pepi, i, ebla, continued, to, be, a, center, of, trade, during, the, second, kingdom, evidenced, by, the, surrounding,

their, dead, kings, the, pantheon, of, the, first, ebla, included, pairs, of, deities, and, they, can, be, separated, into, three, genres, in, the, first, and, most, common, one, there, were, the, couples, such, as, the, deity, and, his, female, consort, the, second, type, of, pairs, was, the, divine, twosomes, such, as, the, deities, that, cooperate, to, create, the, cosmos, like, in, the, egyptian, and, mesopotamian, pantheons, the, third, type, included, divine, pairs, who, were, actually, a, single, deity, that, had, two, names, eblaites, worshiped, few, mesopotamian, deities, preferring, north, western, semitic, gods, some, of, which, were, unique, to, ebla, the, first, genre, of, pairs, included, hadabal, d, ni, da, kul, who, was, exclusive, to, ebla, and, his, consort, belatu, his, wife, rasap, and, his, consort, adamma, the, patron, gods, of, the, city, kura, who, was, unique, to, ebla, and, his, consort, barama, the, third, genre, included, the, artisan, god, kamish, tit, kothar, wa, khasis, and, the, planet, venus, represented, by, twin, mountain, gods, shahar, as, the, morning, star, and, shalim, as, the, evening, star, the, first, eblaites, worshiped, many, other, deities, such, as, the, syrian, goddess, ishara, who, was, the, goddess, of, the, royal, family, ishtar, was, also, worshiped, but, was, mentioned, only, five, times, in, one, of, the, monthly, offering, lists, while, ishara, was, far, more, important, appearing, 40, times, other, deities, included, damu, the, mesopotamian, god, utu, ashtapi, dagan, hadad, hadda, and, his, consort, halabatu, she, of, halab, and, shipish, the, goddess, of, the, sun, who, had, a, temple, dedicated, to, her, cult, the, four, city, gates, were, named, after, the, gods, dagan, hadda, rasap, and, utu, but, it, is, unknown, which, gate, had, which, name, overall, the, offering, list, mentioned, about, 40, deities, receiving, sacrifices, during, the, third, kingdom, amorites, worshiped, common, northern, semitic, gods, the, unique, eblaite, deities, disappeared, hadad, was, the, most, important, god, while, ishtar, took, ishara, s, place, and, became, the, city, s, most, important, deity, apart, from, hadad, at, the, beginning, of, the, process, of, deciphering, the, tablets, giovanni, pettinato, made, claims, about, possible, connections, between, ebla, and, the, bible, citing, alleged, references, in, the, tablets, to, the, existence, of, yahweh, the, patriarchs, sodom, and, gomorrah, and, other, biblical, references, however, much, of, the, initial, media, excitement, about, a, supposed, eblaite, connections, with, the, bible, based, on, preliminary, guesses, and, speculations, by, pettinato, and, others, is, now, widely, discredited, and, the, academic, consensus, is, that, ebla, has, no, bearing, on, the, minor, prophets, the, historical, accuracy, of, the, biblical, patriarchs, yahweh, worship, or, sodom, and, gomorrah, in, ebla, studies, the, focus, has, shifted, away, from, comparisons, with, the, bible, ebla, is, now, studied, as, a, civilization, in, its, own, right, the, claims, led, to, a, bitter, personal, and, academic, conflict, between, the, scholars, involved, as, well, as, what, some, described, as, political, interference, by, the, syrian, authorities, ancient, dna, analysis, on, 10, human, remains, dating, to, the, early, and, middle,

excavating, at, tell, mardikh, in, 1968, they, recovered, a, statue, dedicated, to, the, goddess, ishtar, bearing, the, name, of, ibbit, lim, mentioning, him, as, king, of, ebla, that, identified, the, city, long, known, from, lagashite, and, akkadian, inscriptions, in, the, next, decade, the, team, discovered, a, palace, palace, g, dating, from, c, 2500, 2000, bc, finds, in, the, palaces, include, a, small, sculpture, made, out, of, precious, materials, lapis, lazuli, black, stones, and, gold, thirteen, full, and, fragmentary, lenticular, cuneiform, tablets, were, found, in, the, palace, throne, room, thought, to, have, been, there, versus, the, archive, because, of, the, city, s, fall, in, a, storeroom, off, the, throne, room, the, nearly, complete, standard, of, the, queen, and, fragments, believed, to, come, from, the, standard, of, the, king, were, found, other, artifacts, included, wood, furniture, inlaid, with, mother, of, pearl, and, composite, statues, created, from, colored, stones, a, silver, bowl, bearing, king, immeya, s, name, was, recovered, from, the, tomb, of, the, lord, of, the, goats, together, with, egyptian, jewels, and, an, egyptian, ceremonial, mace, presented, by, pharaoh, hotepibre, about, 17, 000, cuneiform, tablet, fragments, were, discovered, when, put, together, they, constitute, 2, 500, complete, tablets, making, the, archive, of, ebla, one, of, the, biggest, from, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, about, 80, of, the, tablets, are, written, using, the, usual, sumerian, combination, of, logograms, and, phonetic, signs, while, the, others, exhibited, an, innovative, purely, phonetic, representation, using, sumerian, cuneiform, of, a, previously, unknown, semitic, language, which, was, called, eblaite, bilingual, sumerian, eblaite, vocabulary, lists, were, found, among, the, tablets, allowing, them, to, be, translated, the, tablets, provide, many, important, insights, into, the, cultural, economic, and, political, life, in, northern, mesopotamia, around, the, middle, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, they, also, provide, insight, into, the, everyday, lives, of, the, inhabitants, and, contain, information, about, state, revenues, sumerian, eblaite, dictionaries, diplomatic, exchanges, with, foreign, rulers, school, texts, hymns, and, myths, the, over, 4000, year, old, tablets, constitute, the, oldest, library, ever, found, at, ebla, the, archives, or, library, constituted, an, orderly, collection, of, records, at, least, 500, years, older, than, any, other, that, had, been, found, anywhere, before, there, is, evidence, of, their, arrangement, and, classification, the, larger, tablets, had, originally, been, stored, on, shelves, but, had, fallen, onto, the, floor, when, the, palace, was, destroyed, the, locations, of, the, fallen, tablets, allowed, the, excavators, to, reconstruct, their, original, positions, on, the, shelves, they, found, the, tablets, had, originally, been, shelved, according, to, subject, these, features, were, absent, from, earlier, sumerian, excavations, sophisticated, techniques, of, arrangement, of, texts, coupled, with, their, composition, evidence, the, great, antiquity, of, archival, and, library, practices, which, may, be, far, older, than, was, assumed, to, be, the, case, before, the, discovery, of, the, ebla, library, a, sizable, portion, of, the, tablets, contain, literary, and, lexicographic, texts, evidence, seems, to, suggest, the, collection, also, served, at, least, partially, as, a, true, library, rather, than, a, collection, of, archives, intended, solely, for, use, by, the, kings, their, ministers, and, their, bureaucracy, the, tablets, show, evidence, of, the, early, transcription, of, texts, into, foreign, languages, and, scripts, classification, and, cataloging, for, easier, retrieval, and, arrangement, by, size, form, and, content, the, ebla, tablets, have, thus, provided, scholars, with, new, insights, into, the, origin, of, library, practices, that, were, in, use, 4, 500, years, ago, while, the, absolute, chronology, of, the, archive, is, not, yet, certain, a, relative, chronology, for, the, 50, year, period, has, been, established, because, ebla, did, not, use, mesopotamian, style, year, names, or, year, numbers, and, the, name, of, rulers, was, rarely, mentioned, in, the, texts, scholars, used, script, changes, grammar, changes, and, most, importantly, a, prosopography, of, the, members, of, the, court, especially, the, wives, and, daughters, of, the, king, the, most, relevant, tablets, for, this, effort, were, a, series, of, yearly, metal, accounts, and, monthly, linen, accounts, most, of, the, recovered, tablets, and, tablet, fragments, were, stored, at, the, idlib, regional, museum, in, syria, their, current, condition, is, unknown, ebla, s, first, kingdom, is, an, example, of, early, syrian, centralized, states, and, is, considered, one, of, the, earliest, empires, by, scholars, such, as, samuel, finer, and, karl, moore, who, consider, it, the, first, recorded, world, power, ebla, s, discovery, changed, the, former, view, of, syria, s, history, as, a, bridge, between, mesopotamia, and, egypt, it, proved, the, region, was, a, center, of, civilization, in, its, own, right, as, a, result, of, the, syrian, civil, war, excavations, of, ebla, stopped, in, march, 2011, by, 2013, it, was, under, control, of, an, opposition, armed, group, called, arrows, of, the, right, who, took, advantage, of, its, elevated, location, to, use, it, as, an, observation, point, to, watch, for, incoming,
