the, history, of, canada, covers, the, period, from, the, arrival, of, the, paleo, indians, to, north, america, thousands, of, years, ago, to, the, present, day, the, lands, encompassing, present, day, canada, have, been, inhabited, for, millennia, by, indigenous, peoples, with, distinct, trade, networks, spiritual, beliefs, and, styles, of, social, organization, some, of, these, older, civilizations, had, long, faded, by, the, time, of, the, first, european, arrivals, and, have, been, discovered, through, archeological, investigations, from, the, late, 15th, century, french, and, british, expeditions, explored, colonized, and, fought, over, various, places, within, north, america, in, what, constitutes, present, day, canada, the, colony, of, new, france, was, claimed, in, 1534, with, permanent, settlements, beginning, in, 1608, france, ceded, nearly, all, its, north, american, possessions, to, the, great, britain, in, 1763, at, the, treaty, of, paris, after, the, seven, years, war, the, now, british, province, of, quebec, was, divided, into, upper, and, lower, canada, in, 1791, the, two, provinces, were, united, as, the, province, of, canada, by, the, act, of, union, 1840, which, came, into, force, in, 1841, in, 1867, the, province, of, canada, was, joined, with, two, other, british, colonies, of, new, brunswick, and, nova, scotia, through, confederation, forming, a, self, governing, entity, canada, was, adopted, as, the, legal, name, of, the, new, country, and, the, word, dominion, was, conferred, as, the, country, s, title, over, the, next, eighty, two, years, canada, expanded, by, incorporating, other, parts, of, british, north, america, finishing, with, newfoundland, and, labrador, in, 1949, although, responsible, government, had, existed, in, british, north, america, since, 1848, britain, continued, to, set, its, foreign, and, defence, policies, until, the, end, of, world, war, i, the, balfour, declaration, of, 1926, the, 1930, imperial, conference, and, the, passing, of, the, statute, of, westminster, in, 1931, recognized, that, canada, had, become, co, equal, with, the, united, kingdom, the, patriation, of, the, constitution, in, 1982, marked, the, removal, of, legal, dependence, on, the, british, parliament, canada, currently, consists, of, ten, provinces, and, three, territories, and, is, a, parliamentary, democracy, and, a, constitutional, monarchy, over, centuries, elements, of, indigenous, french, british, and, more, recent, immigrant, customs, have, combined, to, form, a, canadian, culture, that, has, also, been, strongly, influenced, by, its, linguistic, geographic, and, economic, neighbour, the, united, states, since, the, conclusion, of, the, second, world, war, canada, s, strong, support, for, multilateralism, and, internationalism, has, been, closely, related, to, its, peacekeeping, efforts, archeological, and, indigenous, genetic, evidence, indicate, that, north, and, south, america, were, the, last, continents, into, which, humans, migrated, during, the, wisconsin, glaciation, 50, 000, 17, 000, years, ago, falling, sea, levels, allowed, people, to, move, gradually, across, the, bering, land, bridge, beringia, from, siberia, into, northwest, north, america, at, that, point, they, were, blocked, by, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, that, covered, most, of, canada, confining, them, to, alaska, and, the, yukon, for, thousands, of, years, the, exact, dates, and, routes, of, the, peopling, of, the, americas, are, the, subject, of, an, ongoing, debate, by, 16, 000, years, ago, the, glacial, melt, allowed, people, to, move, by, land, south, and, east, out, of, beringia, and, into, canada, the, haida, gwaii, islands, old, crow, flats, and, the, bluefish, caves, contain, some, of, the, earliest, paleo, indian, archeological, sites, in, canada, ice, age, hunter, gatherers, of, this, period, left, lithic, flake, fluted, stone, tools, and, the, remains, of, large, butchered, mammals, the, north, american, climate, stabilized, around, 8000, bce, 10, 000, years, ago, climatic, conditions, were, similar, to, modern, patterns, however, the, receding, glacial, ice, sheets, still, covered, large, portions, of, the, land, creating, lakes, of, meltwater, most, population, groups, during, the, archaic, periods, were, still, highly, mobile, hunter, gatherers, however, individual, groups, started, to, focus, on, resources, available, to, them, locally, thus, with, the, passage, of, time, there, is, a, pattern, of, increasing, regional, generalization, i, e, paleo, arctic, plano, and, maritime, archaic, traditions, the, woodland, cultural, period, dates, from, about, 2000, bce, to, 1000, ce, and, is, applied, to, the, ontario, quebec, and, maritime, regions, the, introduction, of, pottery, distinguishes, the, woodland, culture, from, the, previous, archaic, stage, inhabitants, the, laurentian, related, people, of, ontario, manufactured, the, oldest, pottery, excavated, to, date, in, canada, the, hopewell, tradition, is, an, indigenous, culture, that, flourished, along, american, rivers, from, 300, bce, to, 500, ce, at, its, greatest, extent, the,

believed, to, have, originated, in, the, western, plateau, of, idaho, or, the, plains, of, montana, and, moved, with, migrants, eastward, eventually, extending, in, various, manifestations, all, the, way, from, hudson, bay, to, what, is, today, nova, scotia, in, the, east, and, as, far, south, as, the, tidewater, region, of, virginia, speakers, of, eastern, algonquian, languages, included, the, mi, kmaq, and, abenaki, of, the, maritime, region, of, canada, and, likely, the, extinct, beothuk, of, newfoundland, the, ojibwa, and, other, anishinaabe, speakers, of, the, central, algonquian,

least, 1000, ce, in, northern, new, york, but, their, influence, extended, into, what, is, now, southern, ontario, and, the, montreal, area, of, modern, quebec, they, spoke, varieties, of, iroquoian, languages, the, iroquois, confederacy, according, to, oral, tradition, was, formed, in, 1142, ce, in, addition, there, were, other, iroquoian, speaking, peoples, in, the, area, including, the, st, lawrence, iroquoians, the, erie, and, others, on, the, great, plains, the, cree, or, n, hilaw, who, spoke, a, closely, related, central, algonquian, language, the, plains, cree, language, depended,

replaced, by, the, ancestors, of, today, s, inuit, by, 1500, ce, this, transition, is, supported, by, archeological, records, and, inuit, mythology, that, tells, of, having, driven, off, the, tuniit,

newfoundland, carbon, dating, estimate, 990, 1050, ce, l, anse, aux, meadows, the, only, confirmed, norse, site, in, north, america, outside, of, greenland, is, also, notable, for, its, connection, with, the, attempted, settlement, of, vinland, by, leif, erikson, around, the, same, period, or, more, broadly, with, norse, exploration, of, the, americas, under, letters, patent, from, king, henry, vii, of, england, the, italian, john, cabot, became, the, first, european, known, to, have, landed, in, canada, after, the, viking, age, records, indicate, that, on, june, 24, 1497, he, sighted, land, at, a, northern, location, believed, to, be, somewhere, in, the, atlantic, provinces, official, tradition, deemed, the, first, landing, site, to, be, at, cape, bonavista, newfoundland, although, other, locations, are, possible, after, 1497, cabot, and, his, son, sebastian, cabot, continued, to, make, other, voyages, to, find, the, northwest, passage, and, other, explorers, continued, to, sail, out, of, england, to, the, new, world, although, the, details, of, these, voyages, are, not, well, recorded, based, on, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, the, spanish, crown, claimed, it, had, territorial, rights, in, the, area, visited, by, john, cabot, in, 1497, and, 1498, ce, however, portuguese, explorers, like, jo, o, fernandes, lavrador, would, continue, to, visit, the, north, atlantic, coast, which, accounts, for, the, appearance, of, labrador, on, maps, of, the, period, in, 1501, and, 1502, the, corte, real, brothers, explored, newfoundland, terra, nova, and, labrador,

and, pero, de, barcelos, established, fishing, outposts, in, newfoundland, and, nova, scotia, around, 1521, ce, however, these, were, later, abandoned, with, the, portuguese, colonizers, focusing, their, efforts, on, south, america, the, extent, and, nature, of, portuguese, activity, on, the, canadian, mainland, during, the, 16th, century, remains, unclear, and, controversial, french, interest, in, the, new, world, began, with, francis, i, of, france, who, in, 1524, sponsored, giovanni, da, verrazzano, s, navigation, of, the, region, between, florida, and, newfoundland, in, hopes, of, finding, a, route, to, the, pacific, ocean, although, the, english, had, laid, claims, to, it, in, 1497, when, john, cabot, made, landfall, somewhere, on, the, north, american, coast, likely, either, modern, day, newfoundland, or, nova, scotia, and, had, claimed, the, land, for, england, on, behalf, of, henry, vii, these, claims, were, not, exercised, and, england, did, not, attempt, to, create, a, permanent, colony, as, for, the, french, however, jacques, cartier, planted, a, cross, in, the, gasp, peninsula, in, 1534, and, claimed, the, land, in, the, name, of, francis, i, creating, a, region, called, canada, the, following, summer, cartier, had, sailed, up, the, st, lawrence, river, as, far, as, the, lachine, rapids, to, the, spot, where, montreal, now, stands, permanent, settlement, attempts, by, cartier, at, charlesbourg, royal, in, 1541, at, sable, island, in, 1598, by, marquis, de, la, roche, mesgouez, and, at, tadoussac, quebec, in, 1600, by, fran, ois, grav, du, pont, all, eventually, failed, despite, these, initial, failures, french, fishing, fleets, visited, the, atlantic, coast, communities, and, sailed, into, the, st, lawrence, river, trading, and, making, alliances, with, first, nations, as, well, as, establishing, fishing, settlements, such, as, in, perc, 1603, as, a, result, of, france, s, claim, and, activities, in, the, colony, of, canada, the, name, canada, was, found, on, international, maps, showing, the, existence, of, this, colony, within, the, st, lawrence, river, region, in, 1604, a, north, american, fur, trade, monopoly, was, granted, to, pierre, du, gua, sieur, de, mons, the, fur, trade, became, one, of, the, main, economic, ventures, in, north, america, du, gua, led, his, first, colonization, expedition, to, an, island, located, near, the, mouth, of, the, st, croix, river, among, his, lieutenants, was, a, geographer, named, samuel, de, champlain, who, promptly, carried, out, a, major, exploration, of, the, northeastern, coastline, of, what, is, now, the, united, states, in, the, spring, of, 1605, under, samuel, de, champlain, the, new, st, croix, settlement, was, moved, to, port, royal, today, s, annapolis, royal, nova, scotia, samuel, de, champlain, also, landed, at, saint, john, harbour, on, june, 24, 1604, the, feast, of, st, john, the, baptist, and, is, where, the, city, of, saint, john, new, brunswick, and, the, saint, john, river, gets, their, name, in, 1608, champlain, founded, what, is, now, quebec, city, one, of, the, earliest, permanent, settlements, which, would, become, the, capital, of, new, france, he, took, personal, administration, over, the, city, and, its, affairs, and, sent, out, expeditions, to, explore, the, interior, champlain, became, the, first, known, european, to, encounter, lake, champlain, in, 1609, by, 1615, he, had, travelled, by, canoe, up, the, ottawa, river, through, lake, nipissing, and, georgian, bay, to, the, centre, of, huron, country, near, lake, simcoe, during, these, voyages, champlain, aided, the, wendat, aka, hurons, in, their, battles, against, the, iroquois, confederacy, as, a, result, the, iroquois, would, become, enemies, of, the, french, and, be, involved, in, multiple, conflicts, known, as, the, french, and, iroquois, wars, until, the, signing, of, the, great, peace, of, montreal, in, 1701, the, english, led, by, humphrey, gilbert, had, claimed, st, john, s, newfoundland, in, 1583, as, the, first, north, american, english, colony, by, royal, prerogative, of, queen, elizabeth, i, in, the, reign, of, king, james, i, the, english, established, additional, colonies, in, cupids, and, ferryland, newfoundland, and, soon, after, established, the, first, successful, permanent, settlements, of, virginia, to, the, south, on, september, 29, 1621, a, charter, for, the, foundation, of, a, new, world, scottish, colony, was, granted, by, king, james, to, william, alexander, in, 1622, the, first, settlers, left, scotland, they, initially, failed, and, permanent, nova, scotian, settlements, were, not, firmly, established, until, 1629, during, the, end, of, the, anglo, french, war, these, colonies, did, not, last, long, except, the, fisheries, in, ferryland, under, david, kirke, in, 1631, under, charles, i, of, england, the, treaty, of, suza, was, signed, ending, the, war, and, returning, nova, scotia, to, the, french, new, france, was, not, fully, restored, to, french, rule, until, the, 1632, treaty, of, saint, germain, en, laye, this, led, to, new, french, immigrants, and, the, founding, of, trois, rivi, res, in, 1634, after, champlain, s, death, in, 1635, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, jesuit, establishment, became, the, most, dominant, force, in, new, france, and, hoped, to, establish, a, utopian, european, and, aboriginal, christian, community, in, 1642, the, sulpicians, sponsored, a, group, of, settlers, led, by, paul, chomedey, de, maisonneuve, who, founded, ville, marie, the, precursor, to, present, day, montreal, in, 1663, the, french, crown, took, direct, control, of, the, colonies, from, the, company, of, new, france, although, immigration, rates, to, new, france, remained, very, low, under, direct, french, control, most, of, the, new, arrivals, were, farmers, and, the, rate, of, population, growth, among, the, settlers, themselves, had, been, very, high, the, women, had, about, 30, per, cent, more, children, than, comparable, women, who, remained, in, france, yves, landry, says, canadians, had, an, exceptional, diet, for, their, time, this, was, due, to, the, natural, abundance, of, meat, fish, and, pure, water, the, good, food, conservation, conditions, during, the, winter, and, an, adequate, wheat, supply, in, most, years, the, 1666, census, of, new, france, was, conducted, by, france, s, intendant, jean, talon, in, the, winter, of, 1665, 1666, the, census, showed, a, population, count, of, 3, 215, acadians, and, habitants, french, canadian, farmers, in, the, administrative, districts, of, acadia, and, canada, the, census, also, revealed, a, great, difference, in, the, number, of, men, at, 2, 034, versus, 1, 181, women, by, the, early, 1700s, the, new, france, settlers, were, well, established, along, the, shores, of, the, st, lawrence, river, and, parts, of, nova, scotia, with, a, population, of, around, 16, 000, however, new, arrivals, stopped, coming, from, france, in, the, proceeding, decades, meaning, that, the, english, and, scottish, settlers, in, newfoundland, nova, scotia, and, the, southern, thirteen, colonies, outnumbered, the, french, population, approximately, ten, to, one, by, the, 1750s, from, 1670, through, the, hudson, s, bay, company, the, english, also, laid, claim, to, hudson, bay, and, its, drainage, basin, known, as, rupert, s, land, establishing, new, trading, posts, and, forts, while, continuing, to, operate, fishing, settlements, in, newfoundland, french, expansion, along, the, canadian, canoe, routes, challenged, the, hudson, s, bay, company, claims, and, in, 1686, pierre, troyes, led, an, overland, expedition, from, montreal, to, the, shore, of, the, bay, where, they, managed, to, capture, a, handful, of, outposts, la, salle, s, explorations, gave, france, a, claim, to, the, mississippi, river, valley, where, fur, trappers, and, a, few, settlers, set, up, scattered, forts, and, settlements, there, were, four, french, and, indian, wars, and, two, additional, wars, in, acadia, and, nova, scotia, between, the, thirteen, american, colonies, and, new, france, from, 1688, to, 1763, during, king, william, s, war, 1688, to, 1697, military, conflicts, in, acadia, included, the, battle, of, port, royal, 1690, a, naval, battle, in, the, bay, of, fundy, action, of, july, 14, 1696, and, the, raid, on, chignecto, 1696, the, treaty, of, ryswick, in, 1697, ended, the, war, between, the, two, colonial, powers, of, england, and, france, for, a, brief, time, during, queen, anne, s, war, 1702, to, 1713, the, british, conquest, of, acadia, occurred, in, 1710, resulting, in, nova, scotia, other, than, cape, breton, being, officially, ceded, to, the, british, by, the, treaty, of, utrecht, including, rupert, s, land, which, france, had, conquered, in, the, late, 17th, century, battle, of, hudson, s, bay, as, an, immediate, result, of, this, setback, france, founded, the, powerful, fortress, of, louisbourg, on, cape, breton, island, louisbourg, was, intended, to, serve, as, a, year, round, military, and, naval, base, for, france, s, remaining, north, american, empire, and, to, protect, the, entrance, to, the, st, lawrence, river, father, rale, s, war, resulted, in, both, the, fall, of, new, france, s, influence, in, present, day, maine, and, the, british, recognition, that, it, would, have, to, negotiate, with, the, mi, kmaq, in, nova, scotia, during, king, george, s, war, 1744, to, 1748, an, army, of, new, englanders, led, by, william, pepperrell, mounted, an, expedition, of, 90, vessels, and, 4, 000, men, against, louisbourg, in, 1745, within, three, months, the, fortress, surrendered, the, return, of, louisbourg, to, french, control, by, the, peace, treaty, prompted, the, british, to, found, halifax, in, 1749, under, edward, cornwallis, despite, the, official, cessation, of, war, between, the, british, and, french, empires, with, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, the, conflict, in, acadia, and, nova, scotia, continued, as, father, le, loutre, s, war, the, british, ordered, the, acadians, expelled, from, their, lands, in, 1755, during, the, french, and, indian, war, an, event, called, the, expulsion, of, the, acadians, or, le, grand, d, rangement, the, expulsion, resulted, in, approximately, 12, 000, acadians, being, shipped, to, destinations, throughout, britain, s, north, america, and, to, france, quebec, and, the, french, caribbean, colony, of, saint, domingue, the, first, wave, of, the, expulsion, of, the, acadians, began, with, the, bay, of, fundy, campaign, 1755, and, the, second, wave, began, after, the, final, siege, of, louisbourg, 1758, many, of, the, acadians, settled, in, southern, louisiana, creating, the, cajun, culture, there, some, acadians, managed, to, hide, and, others, eventually, returned, to, nova, scotia, but, they, were, far, outnumbered, by, a, new, migration, of, new, england, planters, who, settled, on, the, former, lands, of, the, acadians, and, transformed, nova, scotia, from, a, colony, of, occupation, for, the, british, to, a, settled, colony, with, stronger, ties, to, new, england, britain, eventually, gained, control, of, quebec, city, after, the, battle, of, the, plains, of, abraham, and, the, battle, of, fort, niagara, in, 1759, and, finally, captured, montreal, in, 1760, as, part, of, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, paris, 1763, signed, after, the, defeat, of, new, france, in, the, seven, years, war, france, renounced, its, claims, to, territory, in, mainland, north, america, except, for, fishing, rights, off, newfoundland, and, the, two, small, islands, of, saint, pierre, and, miquelon, where, its, fishermen, could, dry, their, fish, france, had, already, secretly, transferred, its, vast, louisiana, territory, to, spain, under, the, treaty, of, fontainebleau, 1762, in, which, king, louis, xv, of, france, had, given, his, cousin, king, charles, iii, of, spain, the, entire, area, of, the, drainage, basin, of, the, mississippi, river, from, the, great, lakes, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, from, the, appalachian, mountains, to, the, rocky, mountains, france, and, spain, kept, the, treaty, of, fontainebleau, secret, from, other, countries, until, 1764, however, under, the, treaty, of, paris, the, eastern, side, of, the, mississippi, river, basin, became, british, territory, great, britain, returned, to, france, its, most, important, sugar, producing, colony, guadeloupe, which, the, french, considered, more, valuable, than, canada, guadeloupe, produced, more, sugar, than, all, the, british, islands, combined, and, voltaire, had, notoriously, dismissed, canada, as, quelques, arpents, de, neige, a, few, acres, of, snow, following, the, treaty, of, paris, king, george, iii, issued, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, the, proclamation, organized, great, britain, s, new, north, american, empire, and, stabilized, relations, between, the, british, crown, and, aboriginal, peoples, formally, recognizing, aboriginal, title, regulated, trade, settlement, and, land, purchases, on, the, western, frontier, in, the, former, french, territory, the, new, british, rulers, of, canada, first, abolished, and, then, later, reinstated, most, of, the, property, religious, political, and, social, culture, of, the, french, speaking, habitants, guaranteeing, the, right, of, the, canadiens, to, practice, the, catholic, faith, and, to, the, use, of, french, civil, law, now, quebec, civil,

to, take, quebec, from, british, control, was, halted, at, the, battle, of, quebec, by, guy, carleton, with, the, assistance, of, local, militias, the, defeat, of, the, british, army, during, the, siege, of, yorktown, in, october, 1781, signalled, the, end, of, great, britain, s, struggle, to, suppress, the, american, revolution, when, the, british, evacuated, new, york, city, in, 1783, they, took, many, loyalist, refugees, to, nova, scotia, while, other, loyalists, went, to, southwestern, quebec, so, many, loyalists, arrived, on, the, shores, of, the, st, john, river, that, a, separate, colony, new, brunswick, was, created, in, 1784, followed, in, 1791, by, the, division, of, quebec, into, the, largely, french, speaking, lower, canada, french, canada, along, the, st, lawrence, river, and, the, gasp, peninsula, and, an, anglophone, loyalist, upper, canada, with, its, capital, settled, by, 1796, in, york, present, day, toronto, after, 1790, most, of, the, new, settlers, were, american, farmers, searching, for, new, lands, although, generally, favourable, to, republicanism, they, were, relatively, non, political, and, stayed, neutral, in, the, war, of, 1812, in, 1785, saint, john, new, brunswick, became, the, first, incorporated, city, in, what, would, later, become, canada, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, paris, in, 1783, formally, ended, the, war, great, britain, made, several, concessions, to, the, us, at, the, expense, of, the, north, american, colonies, notably, the, borders, between, canada, and, the, united, states, were, officially, demarcated, all, land, south, and, west, of, the, great, lakes, which, was, formerly, a, part, of, the, province, of, quebec, and, included, modern, day, michigan, wisconsin, illinois, indiana, and, ohio, was, ceded, to, the, americans, fishing, rights, were, also, granted, to, the, united, states, in, the, gulf, of, st, lawrence, and, on, the, coast, of, newfoundland, and, the, grand, banks, the, british, ignored, part, of, the, treaty, and, maintained, their, military, outposts, in, the, great, lakes, areas, it, had, ceded, to, the, u, s, and, they, continued, to, supply, their, native, allies, with, munitions, the, british, evacuated, the, outposts, with, the, jay, treaty, of, 1795, but, the, continued, supply, of, munitions, irritated, the, americans, in, the, run, up, to, the, war, of, 1812, canadian, historians, have, had, mixed, views, on, the, long, term, impact, of, the, american, revolution, arthur, lower, in, the, 1950s, provided, the, long, standard, historical, interpretation, that, for, english, canada, the, results, were, counter, revolutionary, inherited, not, the, benefits, but, the, bitterness, of, the, revolution, english, canada, started, its, life, with, as, powerful, a, nostalgic, shove, backward, into, the, past, as, the, conquest, had, given, to, french, canada, two, little, peoples, officially, devoted, to, counter, revolution, to, lost, causes, to, the, tawdry, ideals, of, a, society, of, men, and, masters, and, not, to, the, self, reliant, freedom, alongside, of, them, recently, michel, ducharme, has, agreed, that, canada, did, indeed, oppose, republican, liberty, as, exemplified, by, the, united, states, and, france, however, he, says, it, did, find, a, different, path, forward, when, it, fought, against, british, rulers, after, 1837, to, secure, modern, liberty, that, form, of, liberty, focused, not, on, the, virtues, of, citizens, but, on, protecting, their, rights, from, infringement, by, the, state, the, war, of, 1812, was, fought, between, the, united, states, and, the, british, with, the, british, north, american, colonies, being, heavily, involved, greatly, outgunned, by, the, british, royal, navy, the, american, war, plans, focused, on, an, invasion, of, canada, especially, what, is, today, eastern, and, western, ontario, the, american, frontier, states, voted, for, war, to, suppress, the, first, nations, raids, that, frustrated, the, settlement, of, the, frontier, the, war, on, the, border, with, the, united, states, was, characterized, by, a, series, of, multiple, failed, invasions, and, fiascos, on, both, sides, american, forces, took, control, of, lake, erie, in, 1813, driving, the, british, out, of, western, ontario, killing, the, shawnee, leader, tecumseh, and, breaking, the, military, power, of, his, confederacy, the, war, was, overseen, by, british, army, officers, like, isaac, brock, and, charles, de, salaberry, with, the, assistance, of, first, nations, and, loyalist, informants, most, notably, laura, secord, the, war, ended, with, no, boundary, changes, thanks, to, the, treaty, of, ghent, of, 1814, and, the, rush, bagot, treaty, of, 1817, a, demographic, result, was, the, shifting, of, the, destination, of, american, migration, from, upper, canada, to, ohio, indiana, and, michigan, without, fear, of, indigenous, attacks, after, the, war, supporters, of, britain, tried, to, repress, the, republicanism, that, was, common, among, american, immigrants, to, canada, the, troubling, memory, of, the, war, and, the, american, invasions, etched, itself, into, the, consciousness, of, canadians, as, a, distrust, of, the, intentions, of, the, united, states, towards, the, british, presence, in, north, america, pp, 254, 255, the, rebellions, of, 1837, against, the, british, colonial, government, took, place, in, both, upper, and, lower, canada, in, upper, canada, a, band, of, reformers, under, the, leadership, of, william, lyon, mackenzie, took, up, arms, in, a, disorganized, and, ultimately, unsuccessful, series, of, small, scale, skirmishes, around, toronto, london, and, hamilton, in, lower, canada, a, more, substantial, rebellion, occurred, against, british, rule, both,

framework, for, uniting, british, colonies, in, north, america, into, a, federation, the, resolutions, became, the, basis, for, the, london, conference, of, 1866, which, led, to, the, formation, of, the, dominion, of, canada, on, july, 1, 1867, the, term, dominion, was, chosen, to, indicate, canada, s, status, as, a, self, governing, polity, of, the, british, empire, the, first, time, it, was, used, about, a, country, with, the, coming, into, force, of, the, uk, s, british, north, america, act, 1867, enacted, by, the, british, parliament, canada, became, a, federated, country, in, its, own,

1867, english, canadian, nationalism, sought, to, unite, the, lands, into, one, country, dominated, by, the, english, language, and, loyalist, culture, many, french, canadians, saw, an, opportunity, to, exert, political, control, within, a, new, largely, french, speaking, quebec, pp, 323, 324, and, exaggerated, fears, of, possible, u, s, expansion, northward, on, a, political, level, there, was, a, desire, for, the, expansion, of, responsible, government, and, elimination, of, the, legislative, deadlock, between, upper, and, lower, canada, and, their, replacement, with, provincial, legislatures, in, a, federation, this, was, especially, pushed, by, the, liberal, reform, movement, of, upper, canada, and, the, french, canadian, parti, rouge, in, lower, canada, who, favoured, a, decentralized, union, in, comparison, to, the, upper, canadian, conservative, party, and, to, some, degree, the, french, canadian, parti, bleu, which, favoured, a, centralized, union, using, the,

anglophone, control, of, the, prairies, and, demonstrated, the, national, government, was, capable, of, decisive, action, however, it, lost, the, conservative, party, most, of, their, support, in,

attracted, immigration, to, the, plains, by, ukrainians, and, northern, and, central, europeans, and, by, settlers, from, the, united, states, britain, and, eastern, canada, laurier, signed, a, reciprocity, treaty, with, the, u, s, that, would, lower, tariffs, in, both, directions, conservatives, under, robert, borden, denounced, it, saying, it, would, integrate, canada, s, economy, into,

campaign, to, equal, suffrage, for, women, after, his, landslide, victory, he, introduced, a, bill, in, 1918, for, extending, the, franchise, to, women, this, passed, without, division, but, did, not,

in, 1919, this, was, initially, opposed, not, only, by, britain, but, also, by, the, united, states, which, saw, such, a, delegation, as, an, extra, british, vote, borden, responded, by, pointing, out, that, since, canada, had, lost, nearly, 60, 000, men, a, far, larger, proportion, of, its, men, its, right, to, equal, status, as, a, nation, had, been, consecrated, on, the, battlefield, british, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, eventually, relented, and, convinced, the, reluctant, americans, to, accept, the, presence, of, delegations, from, canada, india, australia, newfoundland, new, zealand, and, south, africa, these, also, received, their, own, seats, in, the, league, of, nations, canada, asked, for, neither, reparations, nor, mandates, it, played, only, a, modest, role, in, paris, but, just, having, a, seat, was, a, matter, of, pride, it, was, cautiously, optimistic, about, the, new, league, of, nations, in, which, it, played, an, active, and, independent, role, in, 1922, british, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, appealed, repeatedly, for, canadian, support, in, the, chanak, crisis, in, which, a, war, threatened, between, britain, and, turkey, canada, refused, leading, to, the, fall, of, lloyd, george, the, department, of, external, affairs, which, had, been, founded, in, 1909, was, expanded, and, promoted, canadian, autonomy,

defusing, postwar, labour, conflicts, the, progressives, refused, to, join, the, government, but, did, help, the, liberals, defeat, non, confidence, motions, king, faced, a, delicate, balancing, act, of, reducing, tariffs, enough, to, please, the, prairie, based, progressives, but, not, too, much, to, alienate, his, vital, support, in, industrial, ontario, and, quebec, which, needed, tariffs, to, compete, with, american, imports, king, and, conservative, leader, arthur, meighen, sparred, constantly, and, bitterly, in, commons, debates, the, progressives, gradually, weakened, their, effective, and, passionate, leader, thomas, crerar, resigned, to, return, to, his, grain, business, and, was, replaced, by, the, more, placid, robert, forke, the, socialist, reformer, j, s, woodsworth,
