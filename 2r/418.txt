the, anglo, dutch, wars, dutch, engels, nederlandse, oorlogen, were, a, series, of, conflicts, mainly, fought, between, the, dutch, republic, and, england, later, great, britain, in, the, mid, 17th, and, late, 18th, century, the, first, three, wars, occurred, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, over, trade, and, overseas, colonies, while, the, fourth, was, fought, a, century, later, almost, all, the, battles, were, naval, engagements, the, english, were, successful, in, the, first, anglo, dutch, war, while, the, dutch, were, successful, in, the, second, and, third, however, in, the, century, between, the, third, and, fourth, war, the, british, royal, navy, had, become, the, most, powerful, maritime, force, in, the, world, while, the, dutch, navy, had, fallen, to, fourth, position, behind, the, french, and, spanish, there, would, be, more, battles, during, the, french, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, the, english, and, the, dutch, were, both, participants, in, the, 16th, century, european, religious, conflicts, between, the, catholic, habsburg, dynasty, and, the, opposing, protestant, states, at, the, same, time, as, the, age, of, exploration, dawned, the, dutch, and, english, both, sought, profits, overseas, in, the, new, world, in, the, early, 1600s, the, dutch, while, continuing, to, fight, the, eighty, years, war, with, the, catholic, habsburgs, also, began, to, carry, out, long, distance, exploration, by, sea, the, dutch, innovation, in, the, trading, of, shares, in, a, joint, stock, company, allowed, them, to, finance, expeditions, with, stock, subscriptions, sold, in, the, united, provinces, and, in, london, they, founded, colonies, in, north, america, india, and, indonesia, the, spice, islands, they, also, enjoyed, continued, success, in, privateering, in, 1628, admiral, piet, heyn, became, the, only, commander, to, successfully, capture, a, large, spanish, treasure, fleet, with, the, many, long, voyages, by, dutch, east, indiamen, their, society, built, an, officer, class, and, institutional, knowledge, that, would, later, be, replicated, in, england, principally, by, the, east, india, company, by, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, the, dutch, joined, the, portuguese, as, the, main, european, traders, in, asia, this, coincided, with, the, enormous, growth, of, the, dutch, merchant, fleet, made, possible, by, the, cheap, mass, production, of, the, fluyt, sailing, ship, types, soon, the, dutch, had, one, of, europe, s, largest, mercantile, fleets, with, more, merchant, ships, than, all, other, nations, combined, and, possessed, a, dominant, position, in, the, baltic, trade, in, 1648, the, dutch, concluded, the, peace, of, m, nster, with, spain, due, to, the, division, of, powers, in, the, dutch, republic, the, army, and, navy, were, the, main, base, of, power, of, the, stadtholder, although, the, budget, allocated, to, them, was, set, by, the, states, general, with, the, arrival, of, peace, the, states, general, decided, to, decommission, most, of, the, dutch, military, this, led, to, conflict, between, the, major, dutch, cities, and, the, new, stadtholder, william, ii, of, orange, bringing, the, republic, to, the, brink, of, civil, war, the, stadtholder, s, unexpected, death, in, 1650, only, added, to, the, political, tensions, in, the, 16th, century, queen, elizabeth, i, commissioned, several, privateers, to, carry, out, long, range, attacks, against, the, spanish, empire, s, global, interests, exemplified, by, the, attacks, by, francis, drake, on, spanish, merchant, shipping, and, colonial, possessions, partly, to, provide, a, pretext, for, ongoing, hostilities, against, spain, elizabeth, assisted, the, dutch, revolt, 1581, against, the, kingdom, of, spain, by, signing, the, treaty, of, nonsuch, in, 1585, with, the, new, dutch, state, of, the, united, provinces, after, the, death, of, elizabeth, i, anglo, spanish, relations, began, to, improve, under, james, the, first, and, the, peace, of, 1604, ended, most, privateering, actions, until, the, outbreak, of, the, next, anglo, spanish, war, during, the, thirty, years, war, underfunding, then, led, to, neglect, of, the, royal, navy, later, catholic, sympathiser, charles, i, of, england, made, a, number, of, secret, agreements, with, spain, directed, against, dutch, sea, power, he, also, embarked, on, a, major, programme, of, naval, reconstruction, enforcing, ship, money, to, finance, the, building, of, such, prestige, vessels, as, hms, sovereign, of, the, seas, but, fearful, of, endangering, his, relations, with, the, powerful, dutch, stadtholder, frederick, henry, prince, of, orange, his, assistance, to, spain, was, limited, in, practice, to, allowing, spanish, troops, on, their, way, to, dunkirk, to, make, use, of, english, shipping, however, in, 1639, when, a, large, spanish, transport, fleet, sought, refuge, in, the, downs, anchorage, off, the, town, of, deal, kent, charles, chose, not, to, protect, it, against, a, dutch, attack, the, resulting, battle, of, the, downs, undermined, both, spanish, sea, power, and, charles, s, reputation, in, spain, meanwhile, in, the, new, world, forces, from, the, dutch, new, netherlands, colony, and, the, english, massachusetts, bay, colony, contested, much, of, america, s, north, eastern, seaboard, the, outbreak, of, the, english, civil, war, in, 1642, began, a, period, in, which, england, s, naval, position, was, severely, weakened, its, navy, was, internally, divided, though, its, officers, tended, to, favour, the, parliamentary, side, after, the, execution, by, public, beheading, of, king, charles, in, 1649, however, oliver, cromwell, was, able, to, unite, his, country, into, the, commonwealth, of, england, he, then, revamped, the, navy, by, expanding, the, number, of, ships, promoting, officers, on, merit, rather, than, family, connections, and, cracking, down, on, embezzlement, by, suppliers, and, dockyard, staff, thereby, positioning, england, to, mount, a, global, challenge, to, dutch, mercantile, dominance, the, mood, in, england, grew, increasingly, belligerent, towards, the, dutch, this, partly, stemmed, from, old, perceived, slights, the, dutch, were, considered, to, have, shown, themselves, ungrateful, for, the, aid, they, had, received, against, the, spanish, by, growing, stronger, than, their, former, english, protectors, dutch, fishermen, caught, most, of, the, herring, off, the, english, east, coast, the, dutch, east, india, company, had, driven, english, traders, out, of, the, east, indies, and, dutch, merchants, vociferously, appealed, to, the, principle, of, free, trade, to, circumvent, taxation, in, english, colonies, there, were, also, new, points, of, conflict, with, the, decline, of, spanish, power, at, the, end, of, the, thirty, years, war, in, 1648, the, colonial, possessions, of, the, portuguese, empire, already, in, the, midst, of, portuguese, restoration, war, and, perhaps, even, those, of, the, spanish, empire, itself, were, up, for, grabs, cromwell, feared, the, influence, of, both, the, orangist, faction, at, home, and, english, royalists, exiled, to, the, republic, the, stadtholders, had, supported, the, stuart, monarchs, william, ii, of, orange, had, married, the, daughter, of, charles, i, of, england, in, 1641, and, they, abhorred, the, trial, and, execution, of, charles, i, early, in, 1651, cromwell, tried, to, ease, tensions, by, sending, a, delegation, to, the, hague, proposing, that, the, dutch, republic, join, the, commonwealth, and, assist, the, english, in, conquering, most, of, spanish, america, for, its, extremely, valuable, resources, this, attempt, to, draw, the, dutch, into, a, lopsided, alliance, with, england, in, fact, led, to, war, the, ruling, faction, in, the, states, of, holland, was, unable, to, formulate, an, answer, to, this, unexpected, offer, and, the, pro, stuart, orangists, incited, mobs, to, harass, cromwell, s, envoys, when, the, delegation, returned, home, the, parliament, of, england, decided, to, pursue, a, policy, of, confrontation, as, a, result, of, cromwell, s, ambitious, programme, of, naval, expansion, at, a, time, when, the, dutch, admiralties, were, selling, off, many, of, their, own, warships, the, english, came, to, possess, a, greater, number, of, larger, and, more, powerful, purpose, built, warships, than, their, rivals, across, the, north, sea, did, however, the, dutch, had, many, more, merchant, ships, together, with, lower, freight, rates, better, financing, and, a, wider, range, of, manufactured, goods, to, sell, although, dutch, ships, were, blocked, by, the, spanish, from, operations, in, most, of, southern, europe, giving, the, english, an, advantage, there, to, protect, english, commercial, interests, in, north, america, in, october, 1651, the, english, parliament, passed, the, first, of, the, navigation, acts, which, mandated, that, all, goods, imported, into, england, must, be, carried, by, english, ships, or, vessels, from, the, exporting, countries, thus, excluding, mostly, dutch, middlemen, agitation, among, the, dutch, merchants, as, a, result, of, the, navigation, acts, was, further, increased, by, george, ayscue, s, capture, in, early, 1652, of, 27, dutch, merchant, ships, trading, with, the, royalist, colony, of, barbados, in, contravention, of, an, embargo, imposed, by, the, parliamentarians, the, dutch, responded, to, the, growing, tensions, by, enlisting, large, numbers, of, armed, merchantmen, into, their, navy, in, 1652, cromwell, required, all, foreign, warships, in, the, north, sea, or, the, english, channel, to, lower, their, colours, when, encountering, english, warships, on, 29, may, 1652, lieutenant, admiral, maarten, tromp, refused, to, lower, the, colours, of, his, ships, after, encountering, an, english, fleet, led, by, general, at, sea, robert, blake, this, resulted, in, a, skirmish, the, battle, of, dover, after, which, the, commonwealth, of, england, declared, war, the, dutch, republic, on, 10, july, after, some, inconclusive, minor, fights, the, english, were, successful, in, the, first, major, battle, with, blade, defeating, the, dutch, vice, admiral, witte, de, with, in, the, battle, of, the, kentish, knock, in, october, 1652, believing, that, the, war, was, all, but, over, the, english, divided, their, forces, and, in, december, were, routed, by, the, fleet, of, lieutenant, admiral, maarten, tromp, at, the, battle, of, dungeness, in, the, english, channel, the, dutch, were, also, victorious, in, march, 1653, at, the, battle, of, leghorn, near, italy, and, had, gained, effective, control, of, both, the, mediterranean, and, the, english, channel, blake, recovering, from, an, injury, rethought, together, with, george, monck, the, whole, system, of, naval, tactics, and, after, the, winter, of, 1653, used, the, line, of, battle, first, to, drive, the, dutch, navy, out, of, the, english, channel, in, the, battle, of, portland, and, then, out, of, the, north, sea, in, the, battle, of, the, gabbard, the, dutch, were, unable, to, effectively, resist, as, the, states, general, of, the, netherlands, had, not, in, time, heeded, the, warnings, of, their, admirals, that, much, larger, warships, were, needed, in, the, final, battle, of, scheveningen, on, 10, august, 1653, tromp, was, killed, a, blow, to, dutch, morale, but, the, english, had, to, end, their, blockade, of, the, dutch, coast, as, both, nations, were, by, now, exhausted, and, cromwell, had, dissolved, the, warlike, rump, parliament, ongoing, peace, negotiations, could, be, brought, to, fruition, albeit, after, many, months, of, slow, diplomatic, exchanges, the, war, ended, on, 5, april, 1654, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, westminster, ratified, by, the, states, general, on, 8, may, but, the, commercial, rivalry, was, not, resolved, the, english, having, failed, to, replace, the, dutch, as, the, world, s, dominant, trade, nation, the, treaty, contained, a, secret, annex, the, act, of, seclusion, forbidding, the, infant, prince, william, iii, of, orange, from, becoming, stadtholder, of, the, province, of, holland, which, would, prove, to, be, a, future, cause, of, discontent, in, 1653, the, dutch, had, started, a, major, naval, expansion, programme, building, sixty, larger, vessels, partly, closing, the, qualitative, gap, with, the, english, fleet, cromwell, having, started, the, war, against, spain, without, dutch, help, during, his, rule, avoided, a, new, conflict, with, the, republic, even, though, the, dutch, in, the, same, period, defeated, his, portuguese, and, swedish, allies, after, the, english, restoration, in, 1660, charles, ii, tried, through, diplomatic, means, to, make, his, nephew, prince, william, iii, of, orange, stadtholder, of, the, republic, at, the, same, time, charles, promoted, a, series, of, mercantilist, policies, aimed, at, encountering, dutch, mercantile, dominance, which, again, led, to, a, deterioration, in, anglo, dutch, relations, this, subsequently, led, to, a, surge, of, anti, dutch, sentiment, in, england, the, country, being, as, samuel, pepys, put, it, mad, for, war, english, merchants, and, chartered, companies, such, as, the, east, india, company, the, royal, adventurers, trading, into, africa, and, the, levant, company, calculated, that, global, economic, primacy, could, now, be, wrestled, from, the, dutch, they, reckoned, that, a, combination, of, naval, battles, and, irregular, privateering, missions, would, cripple, the, dutch, republic, and, force, the, states, general, to, agree, to, a, favourable, peace, the, plan, was, for, english, ships, to, be, replenished, and, sailors, paid, with, booty, seized, from, captured, dutch, merchant, vessels, returning, from, overseas, in, 1665, many, dutch, ships, were, captured, and, dutch, trade, and, industry, were, hurt, the, english, achieved, several, victories, over, the, dutch, such, as, taking, the, dutch, colony, of, new, netherland, present, day, new, york, by, charles, brother, the, future, james, ii, but, there, were, also, dutch, victories, such, as, the, capture, of, the, royal, navy, flagship, prince, royal, during, the, four, days, battle, the, subject, of, a, famous, painting, by, willem, van, de, velde, dutch, maritime, trade, recovered, from, 1666, while, the, english, war, effort, and, economy, suffered, a, downturn, when, london, was, ravaged, by, plague, and, much, of, the, city, of, london, was, burnt, to, the, ground, by, a, massive, fire, which, was, generally, interpreted, in, the, dutch, republic, as, divine, retribution, for, holmes, s, bonfire, a, surprise, attack, in, june, 1667, the, raid, on, the, medway, on, the, english, fleet, in, its, home, port, arguably, won, the, war, for, the, dutch, british, historian, c, r, boxer, described, it, as, one, of, the, most, humiliating, defeat, suffered, by, british, arms, a, flotilla, of, ships, led, by, michiel, de, ruyter, sailed, up, the, thames, estuary, broke, through, the, defences, guarding, chatham, harbour, set, fire, to, several, warships, moored, there, and, towed, away, hms, unity, and, the, royal, charles, flagship, and, second, largest, ship, of, the, royal, navy, also, in, june, 1667, the, dutch, sailed, a, vessel, from, new, amsterdam, into, modern, day, hampton, roads, virginia, destroying, an, english, ship, in, the, harbour, and, bombarding, its, fort, the, raid, on, the, medway, led, to, widespread, anger, in, england, towards, the, government, this, together, with, the, mounting, costs, of, the, war, and, the, extravagant, spending, of, charles, s, court, produced, a, rebellious, atmosphere, in, london, charles, ordered, the, english, envoys, at, breda, to, sign, a, peace, quickly, with, the, dutch, as, he, feared, an, open, revolt, against, him, soon, the, royal, navy, was, rebuilt, after, the, events, of, the, previous, war, english, public, opinion, was, unenthusiastic, about, starting, a, new, one, however, as, he, was, bound, by, the, secret, treaty, of, dover, charles, ii, was, obliged, to, assist, louis, xiv, in, his, attack, on, the, dutch, republic, in, the, franco, dutch, war, when, the, royal, french, army, was, halted, by, the, hollandic, water, line, a, defence, system, involving, strategic, flooding, an, attempt, was, made, to, invade, the, dutch, republic, by, sea, de, ruyter, won, a, series, of, strategic, victories, against, the, anglo, french, fleet, and, prevented, an, invasion, of, the, dutch, republic, after, these, failures, the, english, parliament, forced, charles, to, make, peace, in, 1688, the, dutch, feared, that, england, might, align, with, france, in, the, upcoming, nine, years, war, potentially, repeating, the, crisis, of, 1672, to, prevent, this, william, of, orange, making, use, of, an, invitation, from, seven, influential, and, discontented, englishmen, led, a, dutch, invasion, force, that, landed, at, torbay, in, devon, from, there, he, marched, on, london, and, successfully, deposed, james, ii, of, england, while, occupying, london, with, his, troops, william, was, placed, on, the, english, throne, alongside, his, wife, mary, and, ended, further, anglo, dutch, conflicts, though, remaining, allies, england, and, after, 1707, great, britain, quickly, surpassed, the, dutch, in, military, and, economic, power, from, roughly, 1720, onwards, dutch, economic, growth, experienced, a, significant, decline, and, in, 1780, the, per, capita, gross, national, income, of, britain, surpassed, their, dutch, counterparts, leading, to, rising, levels, of, resentment, from, the, latter, the, diplomatic, revolution, brought, this, to, light, and, during, the, following, seven, years, war, the, dutch, remained, neutral, when, britain, s, north, american, colonies, revolted, against, british, rule, in, 1776, the, dutch, provided, indirect, support, to, the, rebels, angering, the, british, who, eventually, declared, war, on, the, dutch, in, 1780, by, this, point, the, dutch, navy, had, severely, weakened, possessing, only, 20, ships, of, the, line, the, conflict, consisted, mostly, of, a, series, of, successful, british, operations, against, dutch, colonial, interests, though, one, fleet, action, took, place, at, the, battle, of, dogger, bank, on, 5, august, 1781, which, was, indecisive, the, war, ended, in, a, conclusive, british, victory, and, exposed, the, weakness, of, the, political, and, economic, foundations, of, the, dutch, republic, leading, to, instability, and, revolution, during, the, french, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, france, reduced, the, netherlands, to, a, satellite, state, and, finally, annexed, the, country, in, 1810, in, 1797, the, dutch, fleet, was, defeated, by, the, british, in, the, battle, of, camperdown, but, an, anglo, russian, invasion, of, holland, in, 1799, was, less, successful, france, still, considered, both, the, extant, dutch, fleet, and, the, large, dutch, shipbuilding, capacity, very, important, assets, the, dutch, navy, was, supposed, to, take, part, in, the, planned, invasion, of, the, united, kingdom, to, this, end, a, large, flotilla, of, flat, bottomed, boats, was, built, in, the, batavian, republic, that, had, to, be, transported, over, sea, to, boulogne, this, was, successful, but, after, the, battle, of, trafalgar, france, gave, up, its, attempt, to, match, the, british, fleet, despite, a, strong, dutch, lobby, to, this, effect, britain, also, invaded, several, dutch, colonies, firstly, in, the, americas, essequibo, was, captured, in, 1803, and, suriname, was, taken, the, following, year, following, their, victory, at, trafalgar, britain, was, now, able, to, strike, dutch, colonies, elsewhere, at, will, the, cape, colony, was, captured, in, southern, africa, in, january, 1806, the, dutch, territories, in, the, caribbean, were, all, taken, by, 1807, including, the, largest, island, curacao, the, dutch, east, indies, was, the, only, area, left, to, be, taken, starting, with, the, first, java, campaign, of, 1806, 1807, which, saw, the, royal, navy, defeating, the, dutch, fleets, to, ensure, british, dominance, in, the, region, after, the, incorporation, of, the, netherlands, in, the, french, empire, in, 1810, the, british, that, year, captured, the, spice, islands, during, a, six, month, campaign, a, year, later, saw, the, final, conquest, of, the, dutch, east, indies, with, the, seizure, of, the, whole, of, java, during, a, month, long, campaign, with, the, signing, of, the, anglo, dutch, treaty, of, 1814, britain, returned, all, those, colonies, to, the, new, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, with, the, exception, of, the, cape, ceylon, and, part, of, dutch, guyana, some, historians, count, the, wars, between, britain, and, the, batavian, republic, and, the, kingdom, of, holland, during, the, napoleonic, era, as, the, fifth, and, sixth, anglo, dutch, wars
