century, ad, the, aksumite, kingdom, rose, to, power, in, the, modern, tigray, region, with, its, capital, at, aksum, and, grew, into, a, major, power, on, the, red, sea, subjugating, south, arabia, and, meroe, and, its, surrounding, areas, in, the, early, fourth, century, during, the, reign, of, ezana, christianity, was, declared, the, state, religion, and, not, long, after, the, aksumite, empire, fell, into, decline, with, the, rise, of, islam, in, the, arabian, peninsula, which, slowly, shifted, trade, away, from, the, christian, aksum, it, eventually, became, isolated, its, economy, slumped, and, aksum, s, commercial, domination, of, the, region, ended, the, aksumites, gave, way, to, the, zagwe, dynasty, who, established, a, new, capital, at, lalibela, before, giving, way, to, the, solomonic, dynasty, in, the, 13th, century, during, the, early, solomonic, period, ethiopia, underwent, military, reforms, and, imperial, expansion, allowing, it, to, dominate, the, horn, of, africa, the, greek, name, from, aithiops, an, ethiopian, is, a, compound, word, later, explained, as, derived, from, the, greek, words, and, aith, i, burn, ps, face, according, to, the, liddell, scott, jones, greek, english, lexicon, the, designation, properly, translates, as, burnt, face, in, noun, form, and, red, brown, in, adjectival, form, the, historian, herodotus, used, the, appellation, to, denote, those, parts, of, africa, south, of, the, sahara, that, were, then, known, within, the, ecumene, habitable, world, the, earliest, mention, of, the, term, is, found, in, the, works, of, homer, where, it, is, used, to, refer, to, two, people, groups, one, in, africa, and, one, in, the, east, from, eastern, turkey, to, india, in, ancient, times, the, name, ethiopia, was, primarily, used, about, the, modern, day, nation, of, sudan, which, is, based, in, the, upper, nile, valley, and, is, located, south, of, egypt, also, called, kush, and, then, secondarily, about, sub, saharan, africa, in, general, reference, to, the, kingdom, of, aksum, designated, as, ethiopia, only, dates, as, far, back, as, the, first, half, of, the, 4th, century, ad, following, the, hellenic, and, biblical, traditions, the, monumentum, adulitanum, a, 3rd, century, inscription, belonging, to, the, aksumite, empire, indicates, that, aksum, s, ruler, governed, an, area, that, was, flanked, to, the, west, by, the, territory, of, ethiopia, and, sasu, the, aksumite, king, ezana, eventually, conquered, nubia, in, the, following, century, a, ge, ez, version, of, the, ezana, inscription, a, is, equated, with, the, unvocalized, b, t, and, b, t, abashat, and, denotes, for, the, first, time, the, highland, inhabitants, of, aksum, this, new, demonym, was, subsequently, rendered, as, bs, a, b, sh, in, sabaic, and, as, abasha, in, arabic, in, the, 15th, century, ge, ez, book, of, axum, the, name, is, ascribed, to, a, legendary, individual, called, ityopp, is, he, was, an, extra, biblical, son, of, cush, son, of, ham, said, to, have, founded, the, city, of, axum, in, english, and, generally, outside, of, ethiopia, the, country, was, historically, known, as, abyssinia, this, toponym, was, derived, from, the, latinized, form, of, the, ancient, habash, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, punt, was, a, kingdom, in, the, horn, of, africa, based, on, archaeological, findings, of, egyptian, mummified, baboons, in, modern, day, ethiopia, and, caves, in, somaliland, dating, back, to, around, the, time, of, punt, egyptian, traders, from, about, 3000, bc, refer, to, lands, south, of, nubia, or, kush, as, punt, and, yam, the, ancient, egyptians, had, myrrh, found, in, punt, which, richard, pankhurst, interprets, to, indicate, trade, between, the, two, countries, was, extant, from, ancient, egypt, s, beginnings, pharaonic, records, indicate, this, possession, of, myrrh, as, early, as, the, first, and, second, dynasties, 3100, 2888, bc, which, was, also, a, prized, product, of, the, horn, of, africa, region, inscriptions, and, pictorial, reliefs, also, indicate, ivory, panther, and, other, animal, skins, myrrh, trees, and, ostrich, feathers, from, the, african, coastal, belt, and, in, the, fourth, egyptian, dynasty, 2789, 2767, bc, a, puntite, is, mentioned, to, be, in, the, service, of, the, son, of, cheops, the, builder, of, the, great, pyramid, j, h, breasted, posited, that, this, early, trade, relationship, could, have, been, realized, through, overland, trade, down, the, nile, and, its, tributaries, i, e, the, blue, nile, and, atbara, the, greek, historian, and, geographer, agatharchides, had, documented, seafaring, among, the, early, egyptians, during, the, prosperous, period, of, the, old, kingdom, between, the, 30th, and, 25th, centuries, b, c, the, river, routes, were, kept, in, order, and, egyptian, ships, sailed, the, red, sea, as, far, as, the, myrrh, country, the, first, known, voyage, to, punt, occurred, in, the, 25th, century, bc, under, the, reign, of, pharaoh, sahure, the, most, famous, expedition, to, punt, however, comes, during, the, reign, of, queen, hatshepsut, probably, around, 1495, bc, as, the, expedition, was, recorded, in, detailed, reliefs, on, the, temple, of, deir, el, bahri, at, thebes, the, inscriptions, depict, a, trading, group, bringing, back, myrrh, trees, sacks, of, myrrh, elephant, tusks, incense, gold, various, fragmented, wood, and, exotic, animals, detailed, information, about, these, two, nations, is, sparse, and, there, are, many, theories, concerning, their, locations, and, the, ethnic, relationships, of, their, peoples, the, egyptians, sometimes, called, the, land, of, punt, god, s, land, due, to, the, large, quantities, of, gold, ivory, and, myrrh, that, could, be, easily, obtained, evidence, of, naqadan, contacts, include, obsidian, from, ethiopia, and, the, aegean, though, not, much, is, known, punt, likely, fell, due, to, ethnic, tensions, between, somali, and, ethiopians, splitting, to, form, 2, different, kingdoms, macrobia, and, d, mt, at, around, the, 1st, millennium, bc, aside, from, the, land, of, punt, the, first, kingdom, that, is, known, to, have, existed, in, ethiopia, was, the, kingdom, of, d, mt, which, rose, to, power, around, the, year, 980, bc, its, capital, was, at, yeha, where, a, so, called, sabean, style, temple, was, built, around, 700, bc, although, no, evidence, of, such, architecture, being, found, in, yemen, the, d, mt, kingdom, was, influenced, by, the, sabaeans, in, yemen, however, it, is, not, known, to, what, extent, while, it, was, once, believed, that, d, mt, was, a, sabaean, colony, it, is, now, believed, that, sabaean, influence, was, minor, limited, to, a, few, localities, and, disappeared, after, a, few, decades, or, a, century, perhaps, representing, a, trading, or, military, colony, in, some, sort, of, symbiosis, or, military, alliance, with, the, civilization, of, d, mt, or, some, other, proto, aksumite, state, few, inscriptions, by, or, about, this, kingdom, survive, and, very, little, archaeological, work, has, taken, place, as, a, result, it, is, not, known, whether, d, mt, ended, as, a, civilization, before, aksum, s, early, stages, evolved, into, the, aksumite, state, or, was, one, of, the, smaller, states, united, in, the, aksumite, kingdom, possibly, around, the, beginning, of, the, 1st, century, the, first, verifiable, kingdom, of, great, power, to, rise, in, ethiopia, was, that, of, axum, in, the, 1st, century, ce, it, was, one, of, many, successor, kingdoms, to, d, mt, and, was, able, to, unite, the, northern, ethiopian, highlands, beginning, around, the, 1st, century, bce, they, established, bases, on, the, northern, highlands, of, the, ethiopian, plateau, and, from, there, expanded, southward, the, persian, religious, figure, mani, listed, axum, with, rome, persia, and, china, as, one, of, the, four, great, powers, of, his, time, the, origins, of, the, axumite, kingdom, are, unclear, although, experts, have, offered, their, speculations, about, it, even, who, should, be, considered, the, earliest, known, king, is, contested, although, carlo, conti, rossini, proposed, that, zoskales, of, axum, mentioned, in, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, should, be, identified, with, one, za, haqle, mentioned, in, the, ethiopian, king, lists, a, view, embraced, by, later, historians, of, ethiopia, such, as, yuri, m, kobishchanov, and, sergew, hable, sellasie, g, w, b, huntingford, argued, that, zoskales, was, only, a, sub, king, whose, authority, was, limited, to, adulis, and, that, conti, rossini, s, identification, can, not, be, substantiated, inscriptions, have, been, found, in, southern, arabia, celebrating, victories, over, one, gdrt, described, as, nagashi, of, habashat, and, of, axum, other, dated, inscriptions, were, used, to, determine, a, floruit, for, gdrt, interpreted, as, representing, a, ge, ez, name, such, as, gadarat, gedur, gadurat, or, gedara, around, the, beginning, of, the, 3rd, century, ce, a, bronze, sceptre, or, wand, has, been, discovered, at, atsbi, dera, with, an, inscription, mentioning, gdr, of, axum, coins, showing, the, royal, portrait, began, to, be, minted, under, king, endubis, toward, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, ce, christianity, was, introduced, into, the, country, by, frumentius, who, was, consecrated, as, the, first, bishop, of, ethiopia, by, saint, athanasius, of, alexandria, in, about, 330, ce, frumentius, converted, ezana, who, left, several, inscriptions, detailing, his, reign, both, before, and, after, his, conversion, one, inscription, which, was, found, at, axum, states, that, he, conquered, the, nation, of, the, bogos, and, returned, thanks, to, his, father, the, god, mars, for, his, victory, later, inscriptions, show, ezana, s, growing, attachment, to, christianity, and, ezana, s, coins, bear, this, out, shifting, from, a, design, with, a, disc, and, crescent, to, a, design, with, a, cross, expeditions, by, ezana, into, the, kingdom, of, kush, at, meroe, in, sudan, may, have, brought, about, its, demise, though, there, is, evidence, that, the, kingdom, was, experiencing, a, period, of, decline, beforehand, as, a, result, of, ezana, s, expansions, aksum, bordered, the, roman, province, of, egypt, the, degree, of, ezana, s, control, over, yemen, is, uncertain, though, there, is, little, evidence, supporting, aksumite, control, of, the, region, at, that, time, his, title, which, includes, king, of, saba, and, salhen, himyar, and, dhu, raydan, all, in, modern, day, yemen, along, with, gold, aksumite, coins, with, the, inscriptions, king, of, the, habshat, or, habashite, indicate, that, aksum, might, have, retained, some, legal, or, actual, footing, in, the, area, toward, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, ce, a, group, of, monks, known, as, the, nine, saints, are, believed, to, have, established, themselves, in, the, country, they, fueled, the, spread, of, christianity, in, ethiopia, by, establishing, many, churches, such, as, abuna, yemata, guh, also, known, as, the, chapel, in, the, sky, since, then, monasticism, has, been, a, power, among, the, people, and, not, without, its, influence, on, events, once, again, the, axumite, kingdom, is, recorded, as, controlling, part, if, not, all, of, yemen, in, the, 6th, century, ce, around, 523, ce, the, jewish, king, dhu, nuwas, came, to, power, in, yemen, and, after, he, announced, that, he, would, kill, all, of, the, christians, he, attacked, an, aksumite, garrison, at, zafar, burning, the, city, s, churches, he, then, attacked, the, christian, stronghold, of, najran, slaughtering, the, christians, who, would, not, convert, to, judaism, emperor, justin, i, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, requested, that, his, fellow, christian, kaleb, help, him, in, his, fight, against, the, yemenite, king, around, 525, ce, kaleb, invaded, and, defeated, dhu, nuwas, appointing, his, christian, follower, sumuafa, ashawa, as, his, viceroy, this, dating, is, tentative, however, as, the, basis, of, the, year, 525, ce, for, the, invasion, is, based, on, the, date, of, the, death, of, the, man, who, was, the, ruler, of, yemen, at, that, time, who, very, well, could, have, been, kaleb, s, viceroy, procopius, records, that, after, about, five, years, abraha, deposed, the, viceroy, and, made, himself, king, histories, 1, 20, despite, several, attempted, invasions, across, the, red, sea, kaleb, was, unable, to, dislodge, abreha, and, acquiesced, in, the, change, this, was, the, last, time, ethiopian, armies, left, africa, until, the, 20th, century, ce, when, several, units, participated, in, the, korean, war, eventually, kaleb, abdicated, in, favour, of, his, son, wa, zeb, and, retired, to, a, monastery, where, he, ended, his, days, abraha, later, made, peace, with, kaleb, s, successor, and, recognized, his, suzerainty, despite, this, reverse, under, ezana, and, kaleb, the, kingdom, was, at, its, height, benefiting, from, a, large, trade, which, extended, as, far, as, india, and, ceylon, and, were, in, constant, communication, with, the, byzantine, empire, details, about, the, history, of, the, axumite, kingdom, never, abundant, became, scarcer, after, this, point, the, last, king, of, axum, who, is, known, to, have, minted, coins, was, armah, whose, coinage, refers, to, the, persian, conquest, of, jerusalem, in, 614, ce, according, to, an, early, muslim, tradition, the, negus, sahama, offered, asylum, to, a, group, of, muslims, who, were, fleeing, from, persecution, during, muhammad, s, lifetime, 615, ce, but, stuart, munro, hay, believes, that, axum, had, been, abandoned, as, the, capital, by, that, time, although, kobishchanov, states, that, ethiopian, raiders, plagued, the, red, sea, preying, on, arabian, ports, at, least, as, late, as, 702, ce, some, people, believe, that, the, end, of, the, axumite, kingdom, is, as, mysterious, as, the, beginning, of, it, is, lacking, a, detailed, history, the, kingdom, s, fall, has, been, attributed, to, a, persistent, drought, overgrazing, deforestation, a, plague, a, shift, in, trade, routes, that, reduced, the, importance, of, the, red, sea, or, a, combination, of, all, of, these, factors, munro, hay, cites, the, muslim, historian, abu, ja, far, al, khwarazmi, kharazmi, who, wrote, before, 833, ce, as, stating, that, the, capital, of, the, kingdom, of, habash, was, jarma, unless, jarma, is, a, nickname, for, axum, hypothetically, from, ge, ez, girma, remarkable, revered, the, capital, had, moved, from, axum, to, a, new, site, yet, undiscovered, about, 1000, presumably, c, 960, though, the, date, is, uncertain, a, jewish, princess, yodit, judith, nicknamed, gudit, conspired, to, murder, all, the, members, of, the, royal, family, and, establish, herself, as, monarch, according, to, legends, during, the, execution, of, the, royals, an, infant, heir, of, the, axumite, monarch, was, carted, off, by, some, faithful, adherents, and, conveyed, to, shewa, where, his, authority, was, acknowledged, concurrently, gudit, reigned, for, forty, years, over, the, rest, of, the, kingdom, and, transmitted, the, crown, to, her, descendants, though, parts, of, this, story, were, most, likely, made, up, by, the, solomonic, dynasty, to, legitimize, its, rule, it, is, known, that, a, female, ruler, did, conquer, the, country, about, this, time, at, one, point, during, the, next, century, the, last, of, yodit, s, successors, were, overthrown, by, an, agaw, lord, named, mara, takla, haymanot, who, founded, the, zagwe, dynasty, named, after, the, agaw, people, who, ruled, during, this, time, and, married, a, female, descendant, of, the, aksumite, monarchs, son, in, law, or, previous, ruler, exactly, when, the, new, dynasty, came, to, power, is, unknown, as, is, the, number, of, kings, in, the, dynasty, the, new, zagwe, dynasty, established, its, capital, at, roha, also, called, adefa, where, they, built, a, series, of, monolithic, churches, these, structures, are, traditionally, ascribed, to, the, king, gebre, mesqel, lalibela, with, the, city, being, renamed, lalibela, in, his, honour, though, in, truth, some, of, them, were, built, before, and, after, him, the, architecture, of, the, zagwe, shows, a, continuation, of, earlier, aksumite, traditions, as, can, be, seen, at, lalibela, and, at, yemrehana, krestos, church, the, building, of, rock, hewn, churches, which, first, appeared, in, the, late, aksumite, era, and, continued, into, the, solomonic, dynasty, reached, its, peak, under, the, zagwe, the, zagwe, dynasty, controlled, a, smaller, area, than, the, aksumites, or, the, solomonic, dynasty, with, its, core, in, the, lasta, region, the, zagwe, seem, to, have, ruled, over, a, mostly, peaceful, state, with, a, flourishing, urban, culture, in, contrast, to, the, more, warlike, solomonids, with, their, mobile, capitals, david, buxton, remarked, that, the, zagwe, achieved, a, degree, of, stability, and, technical, advancement, seldom, equalled, in, abyssinian, history, the, church, and, state, were, very, closely, linked, and, they, may, have, had, a, more, theocratic, society, than, the, aksumites, or, solomonids, with, three, zagwe, kings, being, canonized, as, saints, and, one, possibly, being, an, ordained, priest, unlike, the, aksumites, the, zagwe, were, very, isolated, from, the, other, christian, nations, although, they, did, maintain, a, degree, of, contact, through, jerusalem, and, cairo, like, many, other, nations, and, denominations, the, ethiopian, church, maintained, a, series, of, small, chapels, and, even, an, annex, at, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, saladin, after, retaking, the, holy, city, in, 1187, expressly, invited, the, ethiopian, monks, to, return, and, even, exempted, ethiopian, pilgrims, from, the, pilgrim, tax, his, two, edicts, provide, evidence, of, ethiopia, s, contact, with, these, crusader, states, during, this, period, it, was, during, this, period, that, the, ethiopian, king, gebre, mesqel, lalibela, ordered, the, construction, of, the, legendary, rock, hewn, churches, of, lalibela, later, as, the, crusades, were, dying, out, in, the, early, fourteenth, century, the, ethiopian, emperor, wedem, arad, dispatched, a, thirty, man, mission, to, europe, where, they, travelled, to, rome, to, meet, the, pope, and, then, since, the, medieval, papacy, was, in, schism, they, travelled, to, avignon, to, meet, the, antipope, during, this, trip, the, ethiopian, mission, also, travelled, to, france, spain, and, portugal, in, the, hopes, of, building, an, alliance, against, the, muslim, states, then, threatening, ethiopia, s, existence, plans, were, even, drawn, up, for, a, two, pronged, invasion, of, egypt, with, the, french, king, but, nothing, ever, came, of, the, talks, although, this, brought, ethiopia, back, to, europe, s, attention, leading, to, the, expansion, of, european, influence, when, the, portuguese, explorers, reached, the, indian, ocean, around, 1270, a, new, dynasty, was, established, in, the, abyssinian, highlands, under, yekuno, amlak, with, aid, from, neighbouring, makhzumi, dynasty, deposed, the, last, of, the, zagwe, kings, and, married, one, of, his, daughters, according, to, legends, the, new, dynasty, were, male, line, descendants, of, aksumite, monarchs, now, recognized, as, the, continuing, solomonic, dynasty, the, kingdom, being, thus, restored, to, the, biblical, royal, house, this, legend, was, created, to, legitimize, the, solomonic, dynasty, and, was, written, down, in, the, 14th, century, in, the, kebra, negast, an, account, of, the, origins, of, the, solomonic, dynasty, under, the, solomonic, dynasty, the, chief, provinces, became, tigray, northern, what, is, now, amhara, central, and, shewa, southern, the, seat, of, government, or, rather, of, overlordship, had, usually, been, in, amhara, or, shewa, the, ruler, of, which, calling, himself, n, gus, n, g, st, exacted, tribute, when, he, could, from, the, other, provinces, the, title, of, n, gus, n, g, st, was, to, a, considerable, extent, based, on, their, alleged, direct, descent, from, solomon, and, the, queen, of, sheba, but, it, is, needless, to, say, that, in, many, if, not, in, most, cases, their, success, was, due, more, to, the, force, of, their, arms, than, to, the, purity, of, their, lineage, under, the, early, solomonic, dynasty, ethiopia, engaged, in, military, reforms, and, imperial, expansion, which, left, it, dominating, the, horn, of, africa, especially, under, the, rule, of, amda, seyon, i, there, was, also, great, artistic, and, literary, advancement, at, this, time, but, also, a, decline, in, urbanisation, as, the, solomonic, emperors, didn, t, have, any, fixed, capital, but, rather, moved, around, the, empire, in, mobile, camps, under, the, early, solomonic, dynasty, monasticism, grew, strongly, the, abbot, abba, ewostatewos, created, a, new, order, called, the, ewostathians, who, called, for, reforms, in, the, church, including, observance, of, the, sabbath, but, was, persecuted, for, his, views, and, eventually, forced, into, exile, eventually, dying, in, armenia, his, zealous, followers, also, persecuted, formed, isolated, communities, in, tigray, the, movement, grew, strong, enough, that, the, emperor, dawit, i, after, first, trying, to, crush, the, movement, legalized, their, observance, of, the, sabbath, and, proselytization, of, their, faith, finally, under, zara, yaqob, a, compromise, was, made, between, the, new, egyptian, bishops, and, the, ewostathians, at, the, council, of, mitmaq, in, 1450, restoring, unity, to, the, ethiopian, church, in, around, 1380, dawit, i, campaigned, against, egypt, reaching, as, far, north, as, aswan, he, initiated, this, campaign, in, an, attempt, to, assist, the, coptic, christians, of, upper, egypt, who, he, thought, were, being, oppressed, under, muslim, rule, and, he, felt, he, had, the, duty, to, protect, them, as, he, saw, himself, as, the, protector, of, orthodox, christianity, and, the, copts, in, egypt, in, response, the, emir, forced, the, patriarch, of, alexandria, matthew, i, to, send, a, deputation, to, dawit, to, persuade, him, to, retire, back, to, his, kingdom, there, seems, to, be, little, or, no, doubt, that, on, the, eve, of, the, advent, of, the, burji, dynasty, of, mamluk, egypt, king, dawit, had, led, his, troops, beyond, the, northern, frontiers, of, his, kingdom, and, created, much, havoc, among, the, muslim, inhabitants, of, the, area, who, had, been, within, the, sphere, of, influence, of, egypt, since, the, thirteenth, century, the, emperor, had, a, much, friendlier, relationship, with, the, sultan, s, successor, for, according, to, the, medieval, historian, al, maqrizi, dawit, sent, 22, camels, laden, with, gifts, to, berkuk, the, first, sultan, of, the, burji, dynasty, during, his, first, years, on, the, throne, zara, yaqob, launched, a, strong, campaign, against, survivors, of, pagan, worship, and, un, christian, practices, within, the, church, those, who, admitted, to, worshipping, pagan, gods, were, publicly, decapitated, he, also, took, measures, to, greatly, centralize, the, administration, of, the, country, bringing,

of, emperor, tewoflos, the, chief, nobles, of, ethiopia, feared, that, the, cycle, of, vengeance, that, had, characterized, the, reigns, of, tewoflos, and, tekle, haymanot, i, would, continue, if, a, member, of, the, solomonic, dynasty, were, picked, for, the, throne, so, they, selected, one, of, their, own, yostos, to, be, negus, nagast, king, of, kings, however, his, tenure, was, brief, iyasu, ii, ascended, the, throne, as, a, child, his, mother, empress, mentewab, played, a, major, role, in, iyasu, s, reign, as, well, as, her, grandson, iyoas, mentewab, had, herself, crowned, as, co,

in, ethiopia, in, 1730, and, held, unprecedented, power, over, government, during, his, reign, her, attempt, to, continue, in, this, role, following, the, death, of, her, son, in, 1755, led, her, into, conflict, with, wubit, welete, bersabe, his, widow, who, believed, that, it, was, her, turn, to, preside, at, the, court, of, her, son, iyoas, the, conflict, between, these, two, queens, led, to, mentewab, summoning, her, kwaran, relatives, and, their, forces, to, gondar, to, support, her, wubit, responded, by, summoning, her, own, oromo, relatives, and, their, considerable, forces, from, yejju, the, treasury, of, the, empire, being, allegedly, penniless, on, the, death, of, iyasu, it, suffered, further, from, ethnic, conflict, between, nationalities, that, had, been, part, of, the,

the, daughter, of, an, oromo, chieftain, backfired, in, the, long, run, iyasu, ii, gave, precedence, to, his, mother, and, allowed, her, every, prerogative, as, a, crowned, co, ruler, while, his, wife, wubit, suffered, in, obscurity, wubit, waited, for, the, accession, of, her, son, to, make, a, bid, for, the, power, wielded, for, so, long, by, mentewab, and, her, relatives, from, qwara, when, iyoas, assumed, the, throne, upon, his, father, s, sudden, death, the, aristocrats, of, gondar, were, stunned, to, find, that, he, more, readily, spoke, in, the, oromo, language, rather, than, in, amharic, and, tended, to, favour, his, mother, s, yejju, relatives, over, the, qwarans, of, his, grandmothers, family, iyoas, further, increased, the, favour, given, to, the, oromo, when, adults, on, the, death, of, the, ras, of, amhara, he, attempted, to, promote, his, uncle, lubo, governor, of, that, province, but, the, outcry, led, his, advisor, wolde, leul, to, convince, him, to, change, his, mind, it, is, believed, that, the, power, struggle, between, the, qwarans, led, by, empress, mentewab, and, the, yejju, oromos, led, by, the, emperor, s, mother, wubit, was, about, to, erupt, into, an, armed, conflict, ras, mikael, sehul, was, summoned, to, mediate, between, the, two, camps, he, arrived, and, shrewdly, maneuvered, to, sideline, the, two, queens, and, their, supporters, making, a, bid, for, power, for, himself, mikael, settled, soon, as, the, leader, of, the, amharic, tigrean, christian, camp, of, the, struggle, the, reign, of, iyaos, reign, becomes, a, narrative, of, the, struggle, between, the, powerful, ras, mikael, sehul, and, the, oromo, relatives, of, iyoas, as, iyoas, increasingly, favoured, oromo, leaders, like, fasil, his, relations, with, mikael, sehul, deteriorated, eventually, mikael, sehul, deposed, the, emperor, iyoas, 7, may, 1769, one, week, later, mikael, sehul, had, him, killed, although, the, details, of, his, death, are, contradictory, the, result, was, clear, for, the, first, time, an, emperor, had, lost, his, throne, by, a, means, other, than, his, natural, death, death, in, battle, or, voluntary, abdication, mikael, sehul, had, compromised, the, power, of, the, emperor, and, from, this, point, forward, it, lay, ever, more, openly, in, the, hands, of, the, great, nobles, and, military, commanders, this, point, in, time, has, been, regarded, as, the, start, of, the, era, of, the, princes, an, aged, and, infirm, imperial, uncle, prince, was, enthroned, as, emperor, yohannes, ii, ras, mikael, soon, had, him, murdered, and, underage, tekle, haymanot, ii, was, elevated, to, the, throne, this, bitter, religious, conflict, contributed, to, hostility, toward, foreign, christians, and, europeans, which, persisted, into, the, 20th, century, and, was, a, factor, in, ethiopia, s, isolation, until, the, mid, 19th, century, when, the, first, british, mission, sent, in, 1805, to, conclude, an, alliance, with, ethiopia, and, obtain, a, port, on, the, red, sea, in, case, france, conquered, egypt, the, success, of, this, mission, opened, ethiopia, to, many, more, travellers, missionaries, and, merchants, of, all, countries, and, the, stream, of, europeans, continued, until, well, into, tewodros, s, reign, under, the, emperors, tewodros, ii, 1855, 1868, yohannes, iv, 1872, 1889, and, menelik, ii, 1889, 1913, the, empire,
