the, atlantic, slave, trade, or, transatlantic, slave, trade, involved, the, transportation, by, slave, traders, of, enslaved, african, people, to, the, americas, european, slave, ships, regularly, used, the, triangular, trade, route, and, its, middle, passage, europeans, established, a, coastal, slave, trade, in, the, 15th, century, and, trade, to, the, americas, began, in, the, 16th, century, lasting, through, the, 19th, century, the, vast, majority, of, those, who, were, transported, in, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, were, from, central, africa, and, west, africa, and, had, been, sold, by, west, african, slave, traders, to, european, slave, traders, while, others, had, been, captured, directly, by, the, slave, traders, in, coastal, raids, european, slave, traders, gathered, and, imprisoned, the, enslaved, at, forts, on, the, african, coast, and, then, brought, them, to, the, americas, some, portuguese, and, europeans, participated, in, slave, raids, as, the, national, museums, liverpool, explains, european, traders, captured, some, africans, in, raids, along, the, coast, but, bought, most, of, them, from, local, african, or, african, european, dealers, many, european, slave, traders, generally, did, not, participate, in, slave, raids, because, life, expectancy, for, europeans, in, sub, saharan, africa, was, less, than, one, year, during, the, period, of, the, slave, trade, because, of, malaria, that, was, endemic, in, the, african, continent, an, article, from, pbs, explains, malaria, dysentery, yellow, fever, and, other, diseases, reduced, the, few, europeans, living, and, trading, along, the, west, african, coast, to, a, chronic, state, of, ill, health, and, earned, africa, the, name, white, man, s, grave, in, this, environment, european, merchants, were, rarely, in, a, position, to, call, the, shots, the, earliest, known, use, of, the, phrase, began, in, the, 1830s, and, the, earliest, written, evidence, was, found, in, an, 1836, published, book, by, f, h, rankin, portuguese, coastal, raiders, found, that, slave, raiding, was, too, costly, and, often, ineffective, and, opted, for, established, commercial, relations, the, colonial, south, atlantic, and, caribbean, economies, were, particularly, dependent, on, slave, labour, for, the, production, of, sugarcane, and, other, commodities, this, was, viewed, as, crucial, by, those, western, european, states, which, were, vying, with, one, another, to, create, overseas, empires, the, portuguese, in, the, 16th, century, were, the, first, to, transport, slaves, across, the, atlantic, in, 1526, they, completed, the, first, transatlantic, slave, voyage, to, brazil, and, other, europeans, soon, followed, shipowners, regarded, the, slaves, as, cargo, to, be, transported, to, the, americas, as, quickly, and, cheaply, as, possible, there, to, be, sold, to, work, on, coffee, tobacco, cocoa, sugar, and, cotton, plantations, gold, and, silver, mines, rice, fields, the, construction, industry, cutting, timber, for, ships, as, skilled, labour, and, as, domestic, servants, the, first, enslaved, africans, sent, to, the, english, colonies, were, classified, as, indentured, servants, with, legal, standing, similar, to, that, of, contract, based, workers, coming, from, britain, and, ireland, however, by, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, slavery, had, hardened, as, a, racial, caste, with, african, slaves, and, their, future, offspring, being, legally, the, property, of, their, owners, as, children, born, to, slave, mothers, were, also, slaves, partus, sequitur, ventrem, as, property, the, people, were, considered, merchandise, or, units, of, labour, and, were, sold, at, markets, with, other, goods, and, services, the, major, atlantic, slave, trading, nations, in, order, of, trade, volume, were, portugal, britain, spain, france, the, netherlands, the, united, states, and, denmark, several, had, established, outposts, on, the, african, coast, where, they, purchased, slaves, from, local, african, leaders, these, slaves, were, managed, by, a, factor, who, was, established, on, or, near, the, coast, to, expedite, the, shipping, of, slaves, to, the, new, world, slaves, were, imprisoned, in, a, factory, while, awaiting, shipment, current, estimates, are, that, about, 12, million, to, 12, 8, million, africans, were, shipped, across, the, atlantic, over, a, span, of, 400, years, the, number, purchased, by, the, traders, was, considerably, higher, as, the, passage, had, a, high, death, rate, with, between, 1, 2, and, 2, 4, million, dying, during, the, voyage, and, millions, more, in, seasoning, camps, in, the, caribbean, after, arrival, in, the, new, world, millions, of, people, also, died, as, a, result, of, slave, raids, wars, and, during, transport, to, the, coast, for, sale, to, european, slave, traders, near, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, various, governments, acted, to, ban, the, trade, although, illegal, smuggling, still, occurred, it, was, generally, thought, that, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, ended, in, 1867, but, evidence, was, later, found, of, voyages, until, 1873, in, the, early, 21st, century, several, governments, issued, apologies, for, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, the, atlantic, slave, trade, developed, after, trade, contacts, were, established, between, the, old, world, afro, eurasia, and, the, new, world, the, americas, for, centuries, tidal, currents, had, made, ocean, travel, particularly, difficult, and, risky, for, the, ships, that, were, then, available, thus, there, had, been, very, little, if, any, maritime, contact, between, the, peoples, living, in, these, continents, in, the, 15th, century, however, new, european, developments, in, seafaring, technologies, such, as, the, invention, of, the, caravel, resulted, in, ships, being, better, equipped, to, deal, with, the, tidal, currents, and, could, begin, traversing, the, atlantic, ocean, the, portuguese, set, up, a, navigator, s, school, although, there, is, much, debate, about, whether, it, existed, and, if, it, did, just, what, it, was, between, 1600, and, 1800, approximately, 300, 000, sailors, engaged, in, the, slave, trade, visited, west, africa, in, doing, so, they, came, into, contact, with, societies, living, along, the, west, african, coast, and, in, the, americas, which, they, had, never, previously, encountered, historian, pierre, chaunu, termed, the, consequences, of, european, navigation, disenclavement, with, it, marking, an, end, of, isolation, for, some, societies, and, an, increase, in, inter, societal, contact, for, most, others, historian, john, thornton, noted, a, number, of, technical, and, geographical, factors, combined, to, make, europeans, the, most, likely, people, to, explore, the, atlantic, and, develop, its, commerce, he, identified, these, as, being, the, drive, to, find, new, and, profitable, commercial, opportunities, outside, europe, additionally, there, was, the, desire, to, create, an, alternative, trade, network, to, that, controlled, by, the, muslim, ottoman, empire, of, the, middle, east, which, was, viewed, as, a, commercial, political, and, religious, threat, to, european, christendom, in, particular, european, traders, wanted, to, trade, for, gold, which, could, be, found, in, western, africa, and, to, find, a, maritime, route, to, the, indies, india, where, they, could, trade, for, luxury, goods, such, as, spices, without, having, to, obtain, these, items, from, middle, eastern, islamic, traders, during, the, first, wave, of, european, colonization, although, many, of, the, initial, atlantic, naval, explorations, were, led, by, the, iberian, conquistadors, members, of, many, european, nationalities, were, involved, including, sailors, from, spain, portugal, france, england, the, italian, states, and, the, netherlands, this, diversity, led, thornton, to, describe, the, initial, exploration, of, the, atlantic, as, a, truly, international, exercise, even, if, many, of, the, dramatic, discoveries, were, made, under, the, sponsorship, of, the, iberian, monarchs, that, leadership, later, gave, rise, to, the, myth, that, the, iberians, were, the, sole, leaders, of, the, exploration, european, overseas, expansion, led, to, the, contact, between, the, old, and, new, worlds, producing, the, columbian, exchange, named, after, the, italian, explorer, christopher, columbus, it, started, the, global, silver, trade, from, the, 16th, to, 18th, centuries, and, led, to, direct, european, involvement, in, the, chinese, porcelain, trade, it, involved, the, transfer, of, goods, unique, to, one, hemisphere, to, another, europeans, brought, cattle, horses, and, sheep, to, the, new, world, and, from, the, new, world, europeans, received, tobacco, potatoes, tomatoes, and, maize, other, items, and, commodities, becoming, important, in, global, trade, were, the, tobacco, sugarcane, and, cotton, crops, of, the, americas, along, with, the, gold, and, silver, brought, from, the, american, continent, not, only, to, europe, but, elsewhere, in, the, old, world, by, the, 15th, century, slavery, had, existed, in, the, iberian, peninsula, portugal, and, spain, of, western, europe, throughout, recorded, history, the, roman, empire, had, established, its, system, of, slavery, in, ancient, times, historian, benjamin, isaac, suggests, proto, racism, existed, in, ancient, times, among, greco, roman, people, racial, prejudices, were, based, on, dehumanizing, the, foreign, peoples, they, conquered, through, warfare, since, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, various, systems, of, slavery, continued, in, the, successor, islamic, and, christian, kingdoms, of, the, peninsula, through, the, early, modern, era, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, in, 1441, 1444, portuguese, traders, first, captured, africans, on, the, atlantic, coast, of, africa, in, what, is, today, mauritania, taking, their, captives, to, slavery, in, europe, and, established, a, fort, for, the, slave, trade, at, the, bay, of, arguin, in, the, middle, ages, religion, and, not, race, was, a, determining, factor, for, who, was, considered, to, be, a, legitimate, target, of, slavery, while, christians, did, not, enslave, christians, and, muslims, did, not, enslave, muslims, both, allowed, the, enslavement, of, people, they, regarded, to, be, heretics, or, insufficiently, correct, in, their, religion, which, allowed, catholic, christians, to, enslave, orthodox, christians, and, sunni, muslims, to, enslave, shia, muslims, similarly, both, christians, and, muslims, approved, of, enslaving, pagans, who, came, to, be, a, preferred, and, comparatively, profitable, target, of, the, slave, trade, in, the, middle, ages, spain, and, portugal, were, provided, with, non, catholic, slaves, from, eastern, europe, via, the, balkan, slave, trade, and, the, black, sea, slave, trade, in, the, 15th, century, when, the, balkan, slave, trade, was, taken, over, by, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, black, sea, slave, trade, was, supplanted, by, the, crimean, slave, trade, and, closed, off, from, europe, spain, and, portugal, replaced, this, source, of, slaves, by, importing, slaves, first, from, the, conquered, canary, islands, and, then, from, mainland, africa, initially, from, arab, slave, traders, via, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, from, libya, and, then, directly, from, the, african, west, coast, through, portuguese, outposts, which, developed, into, the, atlantic, slave, trade, and, expanded, significantly, after, the, establishment, of, the, colonies, in, the, americas, in, 1492, in, the, 15th, century, spain, enacted, a, racially, discriminatory, law, named, limpieza, de, sangre, which, translates, as, blood, purity, or, cleanliness, of, blood, a, proto, racial, law, it, prevented, people, with, jewish, and, muslim, ancestry, from, settling, in, the, new, world, limpieza, de, sangre, did, not, guarantee, rights, for, jews, or, muslims, who, converted, to, catholicism, jews, and, muslims, who, converted, to, catholicism, were, respectively, called, conversos, and, moriscos, some, jews, and, muslims, converted, to, christianity, hoping, it, would, grant, them, rights, under, spanish, laws, after, the, discovery, of, new, lands, across, the, atlantic, spain, did, not, want, jews, and, muslims, immigrating, to, the, americas, because, the, spanish, crown, worried, muslims, and, non, christians, might, introduce, islam, and, other, religions, to, native, americans, the, law, also, led, to, the, enslavement, of, jews, and, muslims, prevented, jews, from, entering, the, country, and, from, joining, the, military, universities, and, other, civil, services, although, jewish, conversos, and, muslims, experienced, religious, and, racial, discrimination, some, also, participated, in, the, slave, trade, of, africans, in, lisbon, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, muslims, financed, by, jewish, conversos, traded, africans, across, the, sahara, desert, and, enslaved, africans, before, and, during, the, atlantic, slave, trade, in, europe, and, africa, in, new, spain, spaniards, applied, limpieza, de, sangre, to, africans, and, native, americans, and, created, a, racial, caste, system, believing, them, to, be, impure, because, they, were, not, christian, europeans, enslaved, muslims, and, people, practicing, other, religions, as, a, justification, to, christianize, them, in, 1452, pope, nicholas, v, issued, papal, bull, dum, diversas, which, gave, the, king, of, portugal, the, right, to, enslave, non, christians, to, perpetual, slavery, the, clause, included, muslims, in, west, africa, and, legitimized, the, slave, trade, under, the, catholic, church, in, 1454, pope, nicholas, issued, romanus, pontifex, written, as, a, logical, sequel, to, dum, diversas, romanus, pontifex, allowed, the, european, catholic, nations, to, expand, their, dominion, over, discovered, land, possession, of, non, christian, lands, would, be, justified, along, with, the, enslavement, of, native, non, christian, pagans, in, africa, and, the, new, world, dum, diversas, and, romanus, pontifex, may, have, had, an, influence, with, the, creation, of, doctrines, supportive, of, empire, building, in, 1493, the, doctrine, of, discovery, issued, by, pope, alexander, vi, was, used, as, a, justification, by, spain, to, take, lands, from, non, christians, west, of, the, azores, the, doctrine, of, discovery, stated, that, non, christian, lands, should, be, taken, and, ruled, by, christian, nations, and, indigenous, people, africans, and, native, americans, living, on, their, lands, should, convert, to, christianity, in, 1493, pope, alexander, vi, issued, a, papal, bull, called, inter, caetera, which, gave, spain, and, portugal, rights, to, claim, and, colonize, all, non, christian, lands, in, the, americas, and, enslave, native, americans, and, africans, inter, caetera, also, settled, a, dispute, between, portugal, and, spain, over, those, lands, the, declaration, included, a, north, south, divide, 100, leagues, west, of, the, cape, verde, islands, and, gave, the, spanish, crown, exclusive, rights, to, travel, and, trade, west, of, that, line, in, portugal, and, spain, people, had, been, enslaved, because, of, their, religious, identity, race, had, not, been, a, developed, factor, for, enslaving, people, nonetheless, by, the, 15th, century, europeans, used, both, race, and, religion, as, a, justification, to, enslave, sub, saharan, africans, an, increase, of, enslaved, african, people, from, senegal, occurred, in, the, iberian, peninsula, in, the, 15th, century, as, the, number, of, senegalese, slaves, grew, larger, europeans, developed, new, terminologies, that, associated, slavery, with, skin, color, the, spanish, city, of, seville, had, the, largest, african, population, the, treaty, of, alcacuvas, in, 1479, provided, traders, the, right, to, supply, spaniards, with, africans, in, addition, in, the, 15th, century, dominican, friar, annius, of, viterbo, invoked, the, curse, of, ham, from, the, biblical, story, of, enslavement, to, explain, the, differences, between, europeans, and, africans, in, his, writings, annius, who, frequently, wrote, of, the, superiority, of, christians, over, the, saracens, claimed, that, due, to, the, curse, imposed, upon, black, people, they, would, inevitably, remain, permanently, subjugated, by, arabs, and, other, muslims, he, wrote, that, the, fact, that, so, many, africans, had, been, enslaved, even, by, the, heretical, muslims, was, supposed, proof, of, their, inferiority, through, these, and, other, writings, european, writers, established, a, hitherto, unheard, of, connection, between, a, cursed, people, africa, and, slavery, which, laid, the, ideological, groundwork, for, justifying, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, the, term, race, was, used, by, the, english, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, and, referred, to, family, lineage, and, breed, the, idea, of, race, continued, to, develop, further, through, the, centuries, and, was, used, as, a, justification, for, the, continuation, of, the, slave, trade, and, racial, discrimination, slavery, was, prevalent, in, many, parts, of, africa, for, many, centuries, before, the, beginning, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, an, article, from, pbs, explains, the, differences, between, african, slavery, and, european, slavery, in, the, americas, it, is, important, to, distinguish, between, european, slavery, and, african, slavery, in, most, cases, slavery, systems, in, africa, were, more, like, indentured, servitude, in, that, the, slaves, retained, some, rights, and, children, born, to, slaves, were, generally, born, free, the, slaves, could, be, released, from, servitude, and, join, a, family, clan, in, contrast, european, slaves, were, chattel, or, property, who, were, stripped, of, their, rights, the, cycle, of, slavery, was, perpetual, children, of, slaves, would, by, default, also, be, slaves, millions, of, enslaved, people, from, some, parts, of, africa, were, exported, to, states, in, africa, europe, and, asia, prior, to, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, across, the, sahara, had, functioned, since, antiquity, and, continued, to, do, so, up, until, the, 20th, century, in, 652, the, rashidun, caliphate, in, egypt, enforced, an, annual, tribute, of, 400, slaves, from, the, christian, kingdom, of, makuria, by, the, baqt, treaty, which, was, to, be, in, effect, for, centuries, it, supplied, africans, for, slavery, in, the, rashidun, caliphate, 632, 661, the, umayyad, caliphate, 661, 750, the, abbasid, caliphate, 750, 1258, and, the, mamluk, sultanate, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, not, the, only, slave, trade, from, africa, as, elikia, m, bokolo, wrote, in, le, monde, diplomatique, the, african, continent, was, bled, of, its, human, resources, via, all, possible, routes, across, the, sahara, through, the, red, sea, from, the, indian, ocean, ports, and, across, the, atlantic, at, least, ten, centuries, of, slavery, for, the, benefit, of, the, muslim, countries, from, the, ninth, to, the, nineteenth, four, million, enslaved, people, exported, via, the, red, sea, another, four, million, through, the, swahili, ports, of, the, indian, ocean, perhaps, as, many, as, nine, million, along, the, trans, saharan, caravan, route, and, eleven, to, twenty, million, depending, on, the, author, across, the, atlantic, ocean, slaves, were, marched, in, shackles, to, the, coasts, of, sudan, ethiopia, and, somali, placed, upon, dhows, and, trafficked, across, the, indian, ocean, to, the, gulf, or, aden, others, were, carried, across, the, red, sea, to, arabia, and, aden, with, sick, slaves, being, thrown, overboard, or, they, were, marched, across, the, sahara, desert, via, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, route, to, the, nile, many, of, them, dying, from, exposure, or, swollen, feet, along, the, way, however, estimates, are, imprecise, which, can, affect, comparison, between, different, slave, trades, two, rough, estimates, by, scholars, of, the, numbers, african, slaves, held, over, twelve, centuries, in, the, muslim, world, are, 11, 5, million, and, 14, million, while, other, estimates, indicate, a, number, between, 12, and, 15, million, african, slaves, prior, to, the, 20th, century, according, to, john, k, thornton, europeans, usually, bought, enslaved, people, who, had, been, captured, in, endemic, warfare, between, african, states, some, africans, had, made, a, business, out, of, capturing, war, captives, or, members, of, neighboring, ethnic, groups, and, selling, them, a, reminder, of, this, practice, is, documented, in, the, slave, trade, debates, of, england, in, the, early, 19th, century, all, the, old, writers, concur, in, stating, not, only, that, wars, are, entered, into, for, the, sole, purpose, of, making, slaves, but, that, they, are, fomented, by, europeans, with, a, view, to, that, object, people, living, around, the, niger, river, would, be, transported, from, these, markets, to, the, coast, and, sold, in, european, trading, ports, in, exchange, for, muskets, and, manufactured, goods, such, as, cloth, or, alcohol, the, european, demand, for, slaves, provided, a, new, and, larger, market, for, the, already, existing, trade, while, those, held, as, slaves, in, their, own, region, of, africa, could, hope, to, escape, those, shipped, away, had, little, chance, of, returning, to, their, homeland, the, atlantic, slave, trading, of, africans, began, in, 1441, with, two, portuguese, explorers, nuno, trist, o, and, ant, nio, gon, alves, trist, o, and, gon, alves, sailed, to, mauritania, in, west, africa, and, kidnapped, twelve, africans, and, returned, to, portugal, and, presented, the, captive, africans, as, gifts, to, prince, henry, the, navigator, by, 1460, seven, hundred, to, eight, hundred, african, people, were, taken, annually, and, imported, into, portugal, in, portugal, the, africans, taken, were, used, as, domestic, servants, from, 1460, to, 1500, the, removal, of, africans, increased, as, portugal, and, spain, built, forts, along, the, coast, of, west, africa, by, 1500, portugal, and, spain, had, taken, about, 50, 000, thousand, west, africans, the, africans, worked, as, domestic, servants, artisans, and, farmers, other, africans, were, taken, to, work, the, sugar, plantations, on, the, azores, madeira, canary, and, cape, verde, islands, europeans, participated, in, african, enslavement, because, of, their, need, for, labor, profit, and, religious, motives, upon, discovering, new, lands, through, their, naval, explorations, european, colonisers, soon, began, to, migrate, to, and, settle, in, lands, outside, their, native, continent, off, the, coast, of, africa, european, migrants, under, the, directions, of, the, kingdom, of, castile, invaded, and, colonised, the, canary, islands, during, the, 15th, century, where, they, converted, much, of, the, land, to, the, production, of, wine, and, sugar, along, with, this, they, also, captured, native, canary, islanders, the, guanches, to, use, as, slaves, both, on, the, islands, and, across, the, christian, mediterranean, after, the, success, of, portugal, and, spain, in, the, slave, trade, other, european, nations, followed, in, 1530, an, english, merchant, from, plymouth, william, hawkins, visited, the, guinea, coast, and, left, with, a, few, slaves, in, 1564, hawkin, s, son, john, hawkins, sailed, to, the, guinea, coast, and, his, voyage, was, supported, by, queen, elizabeth, i, john, later, turned, to, piracy, and, stole, 300, africans, from, a, spanish, slave, ship, after, failures, in, guinea, trying, to, capture, africans, as, most, of, his, men, died, after, fights, with, the, local, africans, as, historian, john, thornton, remarked, the, actual, motivation, for, european, expansion, and, for, navigational, breakthroughs, was, little, more, than, to, exploit, the, opportunity, for, immediate, profits, made, by, raiding, and, the, seizure, or, purchase, of, trade, commodities, using, the, canary, islands, as, a, naval, base, europeans, at, the, time, primarily, portuguese, traders, began, to, move, their, activities, down, the, western, coast, of, africa, performing, raids, in, which, slaves, would, be, captured, to, be, later, sold, in, the, mediterranean, although, initially, successful, in, this, venture, it, was, not, long, before, african, naval, forces, were, alerted, to, the, new, dangers, and, the, portuguese, ships, began, to, meet, strong, and, effective, resistance, with, the, crews, of, several, of, them, being, killed, by, african, sailors, whose, boats, were, better, equipped, at, traversing, the, west, central, african, coasts, and, river, systems, by, 1494, the, portuguese, king, had, entered, agreements, with, the, rulers, of, several, west, african, states, that, would, allow, trade, between, their, respective, peoples, enabling, the, portuguese, to, tap, into, the, well, developed, commercial, economy, in, africa, without, engaging, in, hostilities, peaceful, trade, became, the, rule, all, along, the, african, coast, although, there, were, some, rare, exceptions, when, acts, of, aggression, led, to, violence, for, instance, portuguese, traders, attempted, to, conquer, the, bissagos, islands, in, 1535, in, 1571, portugal, supported, by, the, kingdom, of, kongo, took, control, of, the, south, western, region, of, angola, in, order, to, secure, its, threatened, economic, interest, in, the, area, although, kongo, later, joined, a, coalition, in, 1591, to, force, the, portuguese, out, portugal, had, secured, a, foothold, on, the, continent, that, it, continued, to, occupy, until, the, 20th, century, despite, these, incidents, of, occasional, violence, between, african, and, european, forces, many, african, states, ensured, that, any, trade, went, on, in, their, own, terms, for, instance, imposing, custom, duties, on, foreign, ships, in, 1525, the, kongolese, king, afonso, i, seized, a, french, vessel, and, its, crew, for, illegally, trading, on, his, coast, in, addition, afonso, complained, to, the, king, of, portugal, that, portuguese, slave, traders, continued, to, kidnap, his, people, which, was, causing, depopulation, in, his, kingdom, queen, nzinga, nzinga, mbande, fought, against, the, expansion, of, the, portuguese, slave, trade, into, mbundu, people, s, lands, in, central, africa, in, the, 1620s, the, portuguese, encroached, onto, mbundu, lands, to, expand, their, mission, of, trading, slaves, and, establishing, a, settlement, nzinga, allowed, sanctuary, to, runaway, slaves, in, her, nation, and, organized, a, military, called, kilombo, against, the, portuguese, nzinga, formed, alliances, with, other, rival, african, nations, and, led, an, army, against, the, portuguese, slave, traders, in, a, thirty, year, war, historians, have, widely, debated, the, nature, of, the, relationship, between, these, african, kingdoms, and, the, european, traders, the, guyanese, historian, walter, rodney, 1972, has, argued, that, it, was, an, unequal, relationship, with, africans, being, forced, into, a, colonial, trade, with, the, more, economically, developed, europeans, exchanging, raw, materials, and, human, resources, i, e, slaves, for, manufactured, goods, he, argued, that, it, was, this, economic, trade, agreement, dating, back, to, the, 16th, century, that, led, to, africa, being, underdeveloped, in, his, own, time, these, ideas, were, supported, by, other, historians, including, ralph, austen, 1987, this, idea, of, an, unequal, relationship, was, contested, by, john, thornton, 1998, who, argued, that, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, not, nearly, as, critical, to, the, african, economy, as, these, scholars, believed, and, that, african, manufacturing, was, more, than, capable, of, handling, competition, from, preindustrial, europe, however, anne, bailey, commenting, on, thornton, s, suggestion, that, africans, and, europeans, were, equal, partners, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, wrote, o, see, africans, as, partners, implies, equal, terms, and, equal, influence, on, the, global, and, intercontinental, processes, of, the, trade, africans, had, great, influence, on, the, continent, itself, but, they, had, no, direct, influence, on, the, engines, behind, the, trade, in, the, capital, firms, the, shipping, and, insurance, companies, of, europe, and, america, or, the, plantation, systems, in, americas, they, did, not, wield, any, influence, on, the, building, manufacturing, centres, of, the, west, sometimes, trading, between, europeans, and, african, leaders, was, not, equal, for, example, europeans, influenced, africans, to, provide, more, slaves, by, forming, military, alliances, with, warring, african, societies, to, instigate, more, fighting, which, would, provide, more, war, captives, to, the, african, rulers, to, trade, as, slaves, for, european, consumer, goods, also, europeans, shifted, the, location, of, disembarkation, points, for, trade, along, the, african, coast, to, follow, military, conflicts, in, west, central, africa, in, areas, of, africa, where, slavery, was, not, prevalent, european, slave, traders, worked, and, negotiated, with, african, rulers, on, their, terms, for, trade, and, african, rulers, refused, to, supply, european, demands, africans, and, europeans, profited, from, the, slave, trade, however, african, populations, the, social, political, and, military, changes, to, african, societies, suffered, greatly, for, example, mossi, kingdoms, resisted, the, atlantic, slave, trade, and, refused, to, participate, in, the, selling, of, african, people, however, as, time, progressed, more, european, slave, traders, entered, into, west, africa, and, were, having, more, influence, in, african, nations, and, the, mossi, became, involved, in, slave, trading, in, the, 1800s, although, there, were, african, nations, that, participated, and, profited, from, the, atlantic, slave, trade, many, african, nations, resisted, such, as, the, djola, and, balanta, some, african, nations, organized, into, military, resistance, movements, and, fought, african, slave, raiders, and, european, slave, traders, entering, their, villages, for, example, the, akan, etsi, fetu, eguafo, agona, and, asebu, people, organized, into, the, fante, coalition, and, fought, african, and, european, slave, raiders, and, protected, themselves, from, capture, and, enslavement, chief, tomba, was, born, in, 1700, and, his, adopted, father, was, a, general, from, the, jalonke, speaking, people, who, fought, against, the, slave, trade, tomba, became, ruler, of, the, baga, people, in, present, day, guinea, bissau, in, west, africa, and, made, alliances, with, nearby, african, villages, against, african, and, european, slave, traders, his, efforts, were, unsuccessful, tomba, was, captured, by, african, traders, and, sold, into, slavery, dahomey, king, agaja, from, 1718, to, 1740, opposed, the, atlantic, slave, trade, and, refused, to, sell, african, people, and, attacked, the, european, forts, built, along, the, slave, coast, in, west, africa, donna, beatriz, kimpa, vita, in, kongo, and, senegalese, leader, abd, al, qadir, advocated, resistance, against, the, forced, exportation, of, africans, in, the, 1770s, leader, abdul, kader, khan, opposed, the, atlantic, slave, trade, through, futa, toro, present, day, senegal, abdul, kader, khan, and, futa, toro, nation, resisted, french, slave, traders, and, colonizers, who, wanted, to, enslave, africans, and, muslims, from, futa, toro, other, forms, of, resistance, against, the, atlantic, slave, trade, by, african, nations, was, migrating, to, different, areas, in, west, africa, such, as, swamps, and, lake, regions, to, escape, slave, raids, in, west, africa, efik, slave, dealers, participated, in, slave, dealing, as, a, form, of, protection, against, enslavement, african, resistance, movements, were, carried, out, in, every, phase, of, the, slave, trade, to, resisting, marches, to, the, slave, holding, stations, resistance, at, the, slave, coast, and, resistance, on, slave, ships, for, example, aboard, the, slave, ship, clare, the, enslaved, africans, revolted, and, drove, the, crew, from, the, vessel, and, took, control, of, the, ship, and, liberated, themselves, and, landed, near, cape, coast, castle, in, present, day, ghana, in, 1729, on, other, slave, ships, enslaved, africans, sunk, ships, killed, the, crew, and, set, fire, to, ships, with, explosives, slave, traders, and, white, crewmembers, prepared, and, prevented, possible, rebellions, by, loading, women, men, and, children, separately, inside, slave, ships, because, enslaved, children, used, loose, pieces, of, wood, tools, and, any, objects, they, found, and, passed, them, to, the, men, to, free, themselves, and, fight, the, crew, according, to, historical, research, from, the, records, of, slave, ship, captains, between, 1698, and, 1807, there, were, 353, acts, of, insurrection, aboard, slave, ships, the, majority, of, the, rebellions, by, the, africans, were, defeated, igbo, slaves, on, ships, committed, suicide, by, jumping, overboard, as, an, act, of, resistance, to, enslavement, to, prevent, further, suicides, white, crewmen, placed, nets, around, slave, ships, to, catch, enslaved, persons, that, jumped, overboard, white, captains, and, crewmen, invested, in, firearms, swivel, guns, and, ordered, ship, crews, to, watch, slaves, to, prevent, or, prepare, for, possible, slave, revolts, john, newton, was, a, captain, of, slave, ships, and, recorded, in, his, personal, journal, how, africans, mutinied, on, ships, and, some, were, successful, in, overtaking, the, crew, for, example, in, 1730, the, slave, ship, little, george, departed, from, the, guinea, coast, in, route, to, rhode, island, with, a, cargo, of, ninety, six, enslaved, africans, a, few, of, the, slaves, slipped, out, of, their, iron, chains, and, killed, three, of, the, watchmen, on, deck, and, imprisoned, the, captain, and, the, rest, of, the, crew, the, captain, and, crew, made, a, deal, with, the, africans, and, promised, them, their, freedom, the, africans, took, control, of, the, ship, and, sailed, back, to, africa, s, shore, the, captain, and, his, crew, tried, to, re, enslave, the, africans, but, were, unsuccessful, the, atlantic, slave, trade, is, customarily, divided, into, two, eras, known, as, the, first, and, second, atlantic, systems, slightly, more, than, 3, of, the, enslaved, people, exported, from, africa, were, traded, between, 1525, and, 1600, and, 16, in, the, 17th, century, the, first, atlantic, system, was, the, trade, of, enslaved, africans, to, primarily, american, colonies, of, the, portuguese, and, spanish, empires, before, the, 1520s, slavers, took, africans, to, seville, or, the, canary, islands, and, then, exported, some, of, them, from, spain, to, its, colonies, in, hispaniola, and, puerto, rico, with, 1, to, 40, slaves, per, ship, these, supplemented, enslaved, native, americans, in, 1518, the, spanish, king, gave, permission, for, ships, to, go, directly, from, africa, to, the, caribbean, colonies, and, they, started, taking, 200, 300, per, trip, during, the, first, atlantic, system, most, of, these, slavers, were, portuguese, giving, them, a, near, monopoly, decisive, was, the, 1494, treaty, of, tordesillas, which, did, not, allow, spanish, ships, in, african, ports, spain, had, to, rely, on, portuguese, ships, and, sailors, to, bring, slaves, across, the, atlantic, from, 1525, slaves, were, transported, directly, from, the, portuguese, colony, of, sao, tom, across, the, atlantic, to, hispaniola, a, burial, ground, in, campeche, mexico, suggests, enslaved, africans, had, been, brought, there, not, long, after, hern, n, cort, s, completed, the, subjugation, of, aztec, and, mayan, mexico, in, 1519, the, graveyard, had, been, in, use, from, approximately, 1550, to, the, late, 17th, century, in, 1562, john, hawkins, captured, africans, in, what, is, now, sierra, leone, and, took, 300, people, to, sell, in, the, caribbean, in, 1564, he, repeated, the, process, this, time, using, queen, elizabeth, s, own, ship, jesus, of, l, beck, and, numerous, english, voyages, ensued, around, 1560, the, portuguese, began, a, regular, slave, trade, to, brazil, from, 1580, until, 1640, portugal, was, temporarily, united, with, spain, in, the, iberian, union, most, portuguese, contractors, who, obtained, the, asiento, between, 1580, and, 1640, were, conversos, for, portuguese, merchants, many, of, whom, were, new, christians, or, their, descendants, the, union, of, crowns, presented, commercial, opportunities, in, the, slave, trade, to, spanish, america, until, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, mexico, was, the, largest, single, market, for, slaves, in, spanish, america, while, the, portuguese, were, directly, involved, in, trading, enslaved, peoples, to, brazil, the, spanish, empire, relied, on, the, asiento, de, negros, system, awarding, catholic, genoese, merchant, bankers, the, license, to, trade, enslaved, people, from, africa, to, their, colonies, in, spanish, america, cartagena, veracruz, buenos, aires, and, hispaniola, received, the, majority, of, slave, arrivals, mainly, from, angola, this, division, of, the, slave, trade, between, spain, and, portugal, upset, the, british, and, the, dutch, who, invested, in, the, british, west, indies, and, dutch, brazil, producing, sugar, after, the, iberian, union, fell, apart, spain, prohibited, portugal, from, directly, engaging, in, the, slave, trade, as, a, carrier, according, the, treaty, of, m, nster, the, slave, trade, was, opened, for, the, traditional, enemies, of, spain, losing, a, large, share, of, the, trade, to, the, dutch, french, and, english, for, 150, years, spanish, transatlantic, traffic, was, operating, at, trivial, levels, in, many, years, not, a, single, spanish, slave, voyage, set, sail, from, africa, unlike, all, of, their, imperial, competitors, the, spanish, almost, never, delivered, slaves, to, foreign, territories, by, contrast, the, british, and, the, dutch, before, them, sold, slaves, everywhere, in, the, americas, the, second, atlantic, system, was, the, trade, of, enslaved, africans, by, mostly, english, french, and, dutch, traders, and, investors, the, main, destinations, of, this, phase, were, the, caribbean, islands, cura, ao, jamaica, and, martinique, as, european, nations, built, up, economically, slave, dependent, colonies, in, the, new, world, in, 1672, the, royal, africa, company, was, founded, in, 1674, the, new, west, india, company, became, deeper, involved, in, slave, trade, from, 1677, the, compagnie, du, s, n, gal, used, gor, e, to, house, the, slaves, the, spanish, proposed, to, get, the, slaves, from, cape, verde, located, closer, to, the, demarcation, line, between, the, spanish, and, portuguese, empire, but, this, was, against, the, wic, charter, the, royal, african, company, usually, refused, to, deliver, slaves, to, spanish, colonies, though, they, did, sell, them, to, all, comers, from, their, factories, in, kingston, jamaica, and, bridgetown, barbados, in, 1682, spain, allowed, governors, from, havana, porto, bello, panama, and, cartagena, colombia, to, procure, slaves, from, jamaica, by, the, 1690s, the, english, were, shipping, the, most, slaves, from, west, africa, by, the, 18th, century, portuguese, angola, had, become, again, one, of, the, principal, sources, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, after, the, end, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, as, part, of, the, provisions, of, the, treaty, of, utrecht, 1713, the, asiento, was, granted, to, the, south, sea, company, despite, the, south, sea, bubble, the, british, maintained, this, position, during, the, 18th, century, becoming, the, biggest, shippers, of, slaves, across, the, atlantic, it, is, estimated, that, more, than, half, of, the, entire, slave, trade, took, place, during, the, 18th, century, with, the, portuguese, british, and, french, being, the, main, carriers, of, nine, out, of, ten, slaves, abducted, in, africa, at, the, time, slave, trading, was, regarded, as, crucial, to, europe, s, maritime, economy, as, noted, by, one, english, slave, trader, what, a, glorious, and, advantageous, trade, this, is, it, is, the, hinge, on, which, all, the, trade, of, this, globe, moves, meanwhile, it, became, a, business, for, privately, owned, enterprises, reducing, international, complications, after, 1790, by, contrast, captains, typically, checked, out, slave, prices, in, at, least, two, of, the, major, markets, of, kingston, havana, and, charleston, south, carolina, where, prices, by, then, were, similar, before, deciding, where, to, sell, for, the, last, sixteen, years, of, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, spain, was, the, only, transatlantic, slave, trading, empire, following, the, british, slave, trade, act, 1807, and, u, s, bans, on, the, african, slave, trade, that, same, year, it, declined, but, the, period, thereafter, still, accounted, for, 28, 5, of, the, total, volume, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, between, 1810, and, 1860, over, 3, 5, million, slaves, were, transported, with, 850, 000, in, the, 1820s, the, first, side, of, the, triangle, was, the, export, of, goods, from, europe, to, africa, a, number, of, african, kings, and, merchants, took, part, in, the, trading, of, enslaved, people, from, 1440, to, about, 1833, for, each, captive, the, african, rulers, would, receive, a, variety, of, goods, from, europe, these, included, guns, ammunition, alcohol, indigo, dyed, indian, textiles, and, other, factory, made, goods, the, second, leg, of, the, triangle, exported, enslaved, africans, across, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, americas, and, the, caribbean, islands, the, third, and, final, part, of, the, triangle, was, the, return, of, goods, to, europe, from, the, americas, the, goods, were, the, products, of, slave, plantations, and, included, cotton, sugar, tobacco, molasses, and, rum, sir, john, hawkins, considered, the, pioneer, of, the, english, slave, trade, was, the, first, to, run, the, triangular, trade, making, a, profit, at, every, stop, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, the, result, of, among, other, things, labour, shortage, itself, in, turn, created, by, the, desire, of, european, colonists, to, exploit, new, world, land, and, resources, for, capital, profits, native, peoples, were, at, first, utilized, as, slave, labour, by, europeans, until, a, large, number, died, from, overwork, and, old, world, diseases, furthermore, in, the, mid, 16th, century, the, spanish, new, laws, prohibited, slavery, of, the, indigenous, people, a, labour, shortage, resulted, alternative, sources, of, labour, such, as, indentured, servitude, failed, to, provide, a, sufficient, workforce, many, crops, could, not, be, sold, for, profit, or, even, grown, in, europe, exporting, crops, and, goods, from, the, new, world, to, europe, often, proved, to, be, more, profitable, than, producing, them, on, the, european, mainland, a, vast, amount, of, labour, was, needed, to, create, and, sustain, plantations, that, required, intensive, labour, to, grow, harvest, and, process, prized, tropical, crops, western, africa, part, of, which, became, known, as, the, slave, coast, angola, and, nearby, kingdoms, and, later, central, africa, became, the, source, for, enslaved, people, to, meet, the, demand, for, labour, the, basic, reason, for, the, constant, shortage, of, labour, was, that, with, much, cheap, land, available, and, many, landowners, searching, for, workers, free, european, immigrants, were, able, to, become, landowners, themselves, relatively, quickly, thus, increasing, the, need, for, workers, labour, shortages, were, mainly, met, by, the, english, french, and, portuguese, with, african, slave, labour, thomas, jefferson, attributed, the, use, of, slave, labour, in, part, to, the, climate, and, the, consequent, idle, leisure, afforded, by, slave, labour, for, in, a, warm, climate, no, man, will, labour, for, himself, who, can, make, another, labour, for, him, this, is, so, true, that, of, the, proprietors, of, slaves, a, very, small, proportion, indeed, are, ever, seen, to, labour, in, a, 2015, paper, economist, elena, esposito, argued, that, the, enslavement, of, africans, in, colonial, america, was, attributable, to, the, fact, that, the, american, south, was, sufficiently, warm, and, humid, for, malaria, to, thrive, the, disease, had, debilitating, effects, on, the, european, settlers, conversely, many, enslaved, africans, were, taken, from, regions, of, africa, which, hosted, particularly, potent, strains, of, the, disease, so, the, africans, had, already, developed, natural, resistance, to, malaria, this, esposito, argued, resulted, in, higher, malaria, survival, rates, in, the, american, south, among, enslaved, africans, than, among, european, labourers, making, them, a, more, profitable, source, of, labour, and, encouraging, their, use, historian, david, eltis, argues, that, africans, were, enslaved, because, of, cultural, beliefs, in, europe, that, prohibited, the, enslavement, of, cultural, insiders, even, if, there, was, a, source, of, labour, that, could, be, enslaved, such, as, convicts, prisoners, of, war, and, vagrants, eltis, argues, that, traditional, beliefs, existed, in, europe, against, enslaving, christians, few, europeans, not, being, christian, at, the, time, and, those, slaves, that, existed, in, europe, tended, to, be, non, christians, and, their, immediate, descendants, since, a, slave, converting, to, christianity, did, not, guarantee, emancipation, and, thus, by, the, 15th, century, europeans, as, a, whole, came, to, be, regarded, as, insiders, eltis, argues, that, while, all, slave, societies, have, demarked, insiders, and, outsiders, europeans, took, this, process, further, by, extending, the, status, of, insider, to, the, entire, european, continent, rendering, it, unthinkable, to, enslave, a, european, since, this, would, require, enslaving, an, insider, conversely, africans, were, viewed, as, outsiders, and, thus, qualified, for, enslavement, while, europeans, may, have, treated, some, types, of, labour, such, as, convict, labour, with, conditions, similar, to, that, of, slaves, these, labourers, would, not, be, regarded, as, chattel, and, their, progeny, could, not, inherit, their, subordinate, status, thus, not, making, them, slaves, in, the, eyes, of, europeans, the, status, of, chattel, slavery, was, thus, confined, to, non, europeans, such, as, africans, for, the, british, slaves, were, no, more, than, animals, and, could, be, treated, as, commodities, so, situations, like, the, zong, massacre, occurred, without, any, justice, for, the, victims, african, partners, including, rulers, traders, and, military, aristocrats, played, a, direct, role, in, the, slave, trade, they, sold, slaves, acquired, from, wars, or, through, kidnapping, to, europeans, or, their, agents, those, sold, into, slavery, were, usually, from, a, different, ethnic, group, than, those, who, captured, them, whether, enemies, or, just, neighbors, these, captive, slaves, were, considered, other, not, part, of, the, people, of, the, ethnic, group, or, tribe, african, kings, were, only, interested, in, protecting, their, own, ethnic, group, but, sometimes, criminals, would, be, sold, to, get, rid, of, them, most, other, slaves, were, obtained, from, kidnappings, or, through, raids, that, occurred, at, gunpoint, through, joint, ventures, with, the, europeans, the, kingdom, of, dahomey, supplied, war, captives, to, european, slave, traders, according, to, pernille, ipsen, author, of, daughters, of, the, trade, atlantic, slavers, and, interracial, marriage, on, the, gold, coast, africans, from, the, gold, coast, present, day, ghana, also, participated, in, the, slave, trade, through, intermarriage, or, cassare, taken, from, italian, spanish, or, portuguese, meaning, to, set, up, house, it, is, derived, from, the, portuguese, word, casar, meaning, to, marry, cassare, formed, political, and, economic, bonds, between, european, and, african, slave, traders, cassare, was, a, pre, european, contact, practice, used, to, integrate, the, other, from, a, differing, african, tribe, early, on, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, it, was, common, for, the, powerful, elite, west, african, families, to, marry, off, their, women, to, the, european, traders, in, alliance, bolstering, their, syndicate, the, marriages, were, even, performed, using, african, customs, which, europeans, did, not, object, to, seeing, how, important, the, connections, were, it, is, difficult, to, reconstruct, and, generalize, how, africans, residing, in, africa, understood, the, atlantic, slave, trade, though, there, is, evidence, for, some, societies, that, african, elites, and, slave, traders, had, awareness, of, the, conditions, of, the, slaves, who, were, transported, to, the, americas, according, to, robin, law, the, royal, elites, of, the, kingdom, of, dahomey, must, have, had, an, informed, understanding, of, the, fates, of, the, africans, they, sold, into, slavery, dahomey, sent, diplomats, to, brazil, and, portugal, who, returned, with, information, about, their, trips, in, addition, a, few, royal, elites, of, dahomey, had, experienced, slavery, for, themselves, in, the, americas, before, returning, to, their, homeland, the, only, apparent, moral, issue, that, the, kingdom, had, with, slavery, was, the, enslavement, of, fellow, dahomeyans, an, offense, punishable, by, death, rather, than, the, institution, of, slavery, itself, on, the, gold, coast, it, was, common, for, slave, trading, african, rulers, to, encourage, their, children, to, learn, about, europeans, by, sending, them, to, sail, on, european, ships, live, inside, european, forts, or, travel, to, europe, or, america, for, an, education, diplomats, also, traveled, to, european, capital, cities, the, elites, even, rescued, fellow, elites, who, were, tricked, into, slavery, in, the, americas, by, sending, demands, to, the, dutch, and, the, british, governments, who, complied, due, to, fears, of, reduced, trade, and, physical, harm, to, hostages, an, example, is, the, case, of, william, ansah, sessarakoo, who, was, rescued, from, slavery, in, barbados, after, being, recognised, by, a, visiting, slave, trader, of, the, same, fante, ethnic, group, and, later, became, a, slave, trader, himself, fenda, lawrence, was, a, slave, trader, from, the, gambia, who, lived, and, traded, in, georgia, and, south, carolina, as, a, free, person, a, common, assumption, by, africans, who, were, unaware, of, the, true, purpose, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, that, the, europeans, were, cannibals, who, planned, on, cooking, and, eating, their, captives, this, rumour, was, a, common, source, of, significant, distress, for, enslaved, africans, europeans, provided, the, market, for, slaves, rarely, traveling, beyond, the, coast, or, entering, the, african, interior, due, to, fear, of, disease, and, native, resistance, they, typically, resided, in, fortresses, on, the, coasts, where, they, waited, for, africans, to, provide, them, captured, slaves, from, the, interior, in, exchange, for, goods, cases, of, european, merchants, kidnapping, free, africans, into, slavery, often, resulted, in, fierce, retaliation, from, africans, who, could, momentarily, stop, trade, and, even, capture, or, kill, europeans, europeans, who, desired, safe, and, uninterrupted, trade, aimed, to, prevent, kidnapping, incidents, and, the, british, passed, the, acts, of, parliament, for, regulating, the, slave, trade, in, 1750, which, outlawed, the, abduction, of, free, africans, by, fraud, force, or, violence, according, to, a, source, from, the, lowcountry, digital, library, at, the, college, of, charleston, when, portuguese, and, later, their, european, competitors, found, that, peaceful, commercial, relations, alone, did, not, generate, enough, enslaved, africans, to, fill, the, growing, demands, of, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, they, formed, military, alliances, with, certain, african, groups, against, their, enemies, this, encouraged, more, extensive, warfare, to, produce, captives, for, trading, in, 1778, thomas, kitchin, estimated, that, europeans, were, bringing, an, estimated, 52, 000, slaves, to, the, caribbean, yearly, with, the, french, bringing, the, most, africans, to, the, french, west, indies, 13, 000, out, of, the, yearly, estimate, the, atlantic, slave, trade, peaked, in, the, last, two, decades, of, the, 18th, century, during, and, following, the, kongo, civil, war, wars, among, tiny, states, along, the, niger, river, s, igbo, inhabited, region, and, the, accompanying, banditry, also, spiked, in, this, period, another, reason, for, surplus, supply, of, enslaved, people, was, major, warfare, conducted, by, expanding, states, such, as, the, kingdom, of, dahomey, the, oyo, empire, and, the, ashanti, empire, forms, of, slavery, varied, both, in, africa, and, in, the, new, world, in, general, slavery, in, africa, was, not, heritable, that, is, the, children, of, slaves, were, free, while, in, the, americas, children, of, slave, mothers, were, considered, born, into, slavery, this, was, connected, to, another, distinction, slavery, in, west, africa, was, not, reserved, for, racial, or, religious, minorities, as, it, was, in, european, colonies, although, the, case, was, otherwise, in, places, such, as, somalia, where, bantus, were, taken, as, slaves, for, the, ethnic, somalis, the, treatment, of, slaves, in, africa, was, more, variable, than, in, the, americas, at, one, extreme, the, kings, of, dahomey, routinely, slaughtered, slaves, in, hundreds, or, thousands, in, sacrificial, rituals, and, slaves, as, human, sacrifices, were, also, known, in, cameroon, on, the, other, hand, slaves, in, other, places, were, often, treated, as, part, of, the, family, adopted, children, with, significant, rights, including, the, right, to, marry, without, their, masters, permission, scottish, explorer, mungo, park, wrote, the, slaves, in, africa, i, suppose, are, nearly, in, the, proportion, of, three, to, one, to, the, freemen, they, claim, no, reward, for, their, services, except, food, and, clothing, and, are, treated, with, kindness, or, severity, according, to, the, good, or, bad, disposition, of, their, masters, the, slaves, which, are, thus, brought, from, the, interior, may, be, divided, into, two, distinct, classes, first, such, as, were, slaves, from, their, birth, having, been, born, of, enslaved, mothers, secondly, such, as, were, born, free, but, who, afterwards, by, whatever, means, became, slaves, those, of, the, first, description, are, by, far, the, most, numerous, in, the, americas, slaves, were, denied, the, right, to, marry, freely, and, masters, did, not, generally, accept, them, as, equal, members, of, the, family, new, world, slaves, were, considered, the, property, of, their, owners, and, slaves, convicted, of, revolt, or, murder, were, executed, europeans, would, buy, and, ship, slaves, to, the, western, hemisphere, from, markets, across, west, africa, the, number, of, enslaved, people, sold, to, the, new, world, varied, throughout, the, slave, trade, as, for, the, distribution, of, slaves, from, regions, of, activity, certain, areas, produced, far, more, enslaved, people, than, others, between, 1650, and, 1900, 10, 2, million, enslaved, africans, arrived, in, the, americas, from, the, following, regions, in, the, following, proportions, although, the, slave, trade, was, largely, global, there, was, considerable, intracontinental, slave, trade, in, which, 8, million, people, were, enslaved, within, the, african, continent, of, those, who, did, move, out, of, africa, 8, million, were, forced, out, of, eastern, africa, to, be, sent, to, asia, there, were, over, 173, city, states, and, kingdoms, in, the, african, regions, affected, by, the, slave, trade, between, 1502, and, 1853, when, brazil, became, the, last, atlantic, import, nation, to, outlaw, the, slave, trade, of, those, 173, no, fewer, than, 68, could, be, deemed, nation, states, with, political, and, military, infrastructures, that, enabled, them, to, dominate, their, neighbours, nearly, every, present, day,

loss, of, life, for, african, captives, both, in, and, outside, the, americas, estimates, have, ranged, from, as, low, as, 2, million, to, as, high, 60, million, more, than, a, million, people, are, thought, to, have, died, during, their, transport, to, the, new, world, according, to, a, bbc, report, more, died, soon, after, their, arrival, the, number, of, lives, lost, in, the, procurement, of, slaves, remains, a, mystery, but, may, equal, or, exceed, the, number, who, survived, to, be, enslaved, the, trade, led, to, the, destruction, of, individuals, and, cultures, historian, ana, lucia, araujo, has, noted, that, the, process, of, enslavement, did, not, end, with, arrival, on, western, hemisphere, shores, the, different, paths, taken, by, the, individuals, and, groups, who, were, victims, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, were, influenced, by, different, factors, including, the, disembarking, region, the, ability, to, be, sold, on, the, market, the, kind, of, work, performed, gender, age, religion, and, language, patrick, manning, estimates, that, about, 12, million, slaves, entered, the, atlantic, trade, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, but, about, 1, 5, million, died, on, board, ship, about, 10, 5, million, slaves, arrived, in, the, americas, besides, the, slaves, who, died, on, the, middle, passage, more, africans, likely, died, during, the, slave, raids, and, wars, in, africa, and, forced, marches, to, ports, manning, estimates, that, 4, million, died, inside, africa, after, capture, and, many, more, died, young, manning, s, estimate, covers, the, 12, million, who, were, originally, destined, for, the, atlantic, as, well, as, the, 6, million, destined, for, arabian, slave, markets, and, the, 8, million, destined, for, african, markets, of, the, slaves, shipped, to, the, americas, the, largest, share, went, to, brazil, and, the, caribbean, canadian, scholar, adam, jones, characterized, the, deaths, of, millions, of, africans, during, the, atlantic, slave, trade, as, genocide, he, called, it, one, of, the, worst, holocausts, in, human, history, and, claims, arguments, to, the, contrary, such, as, it, was, in, slave, owners, interest, to, keep, slaves, alive, not, exterminate, them, to, be, mostly, sophistry, stating, the, killing, and, destruction, were, intentional, whatever, the, incentives, to, preserve, survivors, of, the, atlantic, passage, for, labour, exploitation, to, revisit, the, issue, of, intent, already, touched, on, if, an, institution, is, deliberately, maintained, and, expanded, by, discernible, agents, though, all, are, aware, of, the, hecatombs, of, casualties, it, is, inflicting, on, a, definable, human, group, then, why, should, this, not, qualify, as, genocide, saidiya, hartman, has, argued, that, the, deaths, of, enslaved, people, was, incidental, to, the, acquisition, of, profit, and, to, the, rise, of, capitalism, death, wasn, t, a, goal, of, its, own, but, just, a, by, product, of, commerce, which, has, the, lasting, effect, of, making, negligible, all, the, millions, of, lives, lost, incidental, death, occurs, when, life, has, no, normative, value, when, no, humans, are, involved, when, the, population, is, in, effect, seen, as, already, dead, hartman, highlights, how, the, atlantic, slave, trade, created, millions, of, corpses, but, unlike, the, concentration, camp, or, the, gulag, extermination, was, not, the, final, objective, it, was, a, corollary, to, the, making, of, commodities, most, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, carried, out, by, seven, nations, and, most, of, the, slaves, were, carried, to, their, own, colonies, in, the, new, world, but, there, was, also, significant, other, trading, which, is, shown, in, the, table, below, the, records, are, not, complete, and, some, data, is, uncertain, the, last, rows, show, that, there, were, also, smaller, numbers, of, slaves, carried, to, europe, and, to, other, parts, of, africa, and, at, least, 1, 8, million, did, not, survive, the, journey, and, were, buried, at, sea, with, little, ceremony, the, timeline, chart, when, the, different, nations, transported, most, of, their, slaves, the, regions, of, africa, from, which, these, slaves, were, taken, is, given, in, the, following, table, from, the, same, source, according, to, kimani, nehusi, the, presence, of, european, slavers, affected, the, way, in, which, the, legal, code, in, african, societies, responded, to, offenders, crimes, traditionally, punishable, by, some, other, form, of, punishment, became, punishable, by, enslavement, and, sale, to, slave, traders, according, to, david, stannard, s, american, holocaust, 50, of, african, deaths, occurred, in, africa, as, a, result, of, wars, between, native, kingdoms, which, produced, the, majority, of, slaves, this, includes, not, only, those, who, died, in, battles, but, also, those, who, died, as, a, result, of, forced, marches, from, inland, areas, to, slave, ports, on, the, various, coasts, the, practice, of, enslaving, enemy, combatants, and, their, villages, was, widespread, throughout, western, and, west, central, africa, although, wars, were, rarely, started, to, procure, slaves, the, slave, trade, was, largely, a, by, product, of, tribal, and, state, warfare, as, a, way, of, removing, potential, dissidents, after, victory, or, financing, future, wars, in, addition, european, nations, instigated, war, between, african, nations, and, increased, the, number, of, war, captives, by, making, alliances, with, warring, nations, and, shifted, trade, locations, in, coastal, areas, to, follow, patterns, of, african, military, conflicts, to, acquire, more, slaves, some, african, groups, proved, particularly, adept, and, brutal, at, the, practice, of, enslaving, such, as, bono, state, oyo, benin, igala, kaabu, ashanti, dahomey, the, aro, confederacy, and, the, imbangala, war, bands, in, letters, written, by, the, manikongo, nzinga, mbemba, afonso, to, the, king, jo, o, iii, of, portugal, he, writes, that, portuguese, merchandise, flowing, in, is, what, is, fueling, the, trade, in, africans, he, requests, the, king, of, portugal, to, stop, sending, merchandise, but, should, only, send, missionaries, in, one, of, his, letters, he, writes, each, day, the, traders, are, kidnapping, our, people, children, of, this, country, sons, of, our, nobles, and, vassals, even, people, of, our, own, family, this, corruption, and, depravity, are, so, widespread, that, our, land, is, entirely, depopulated, we, need, in, this, kingdom, only, priests, and, schoolteachers, and, no, merchandise, unless, it, is, wine, and, flour, for, mass, it, is, our, wish, that, this, kingdom, not, be, a, place, for, the, trade, or, transport, of, slaves, many, of, our, subjects, eagerly, lust, after, portuguese, merchandise, that, your, subjects, have, brought, into, our, domains, to, satisfy, this, inordinate, appetite, they, seize, many, of, our, black, free, subjects, they, sell, them, after, having, taken, these, prisoners, secretly, or, at, night, as, soon, as, the, captives, are, in, the, hands, of, white, men, they, are, branded, with, a, red, hot, iron, before, the, arrival, of, the, portuguese, slavery, had, already, existed, in, the, kingdom, of, kongo, afonso, i, of, kongo, believed, that, the, slave, trade, should, be, subject, to, kongo, law, when, he, suspected, the, portuguese, of, receiving, illegally, enslaved, persons, to, sell, he, wrote, to, king, jo, o, iii, in, 1526, imploring, him, to, put, a, stop, to, the, practice, the, kings, of, dahomey, sold, war, captives, into, transatlantic, slavery, they, would, otherwise, have, been, killed, in, a, ceremony, known, as, the, annual, customs, as, one, of, west, africa, s, principal, slave, states, dahomey, became, extremely, unpopular, with, neighbouring, peoples, like, the, bambara, empire, to, the, east, the, khasso, kingdoms, depended, heavily, on, the, slave, trade, for, their, economy, a, family, s, status, was, indicated, by, the, number, of, slaves, it, owned, leading, to, wars, for, the, sole, purpose, of, taking, more, captives, this, trade, led, the, khasso, into, increasing, contact, with, the, european, settlements, of, africa, s, west, coast, particularly, the, french, benin, grew, increasingly, rich, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, on, the, slave, trade, with, europe, slaves, from, enemy, states, of, the, interior, were, sold, and, carried, to, the, americas, in, dutch, and, portuguese, ships, the, bight, of, benin, s, shore, soon, came, to, be, known, as, the, slave, coast, king, gezo, of, dahomey, said, in, the, 1840s, the, slave, trade, is, the, ruling, principle, of, my, people, it, is, the, source, and, the, glory, of, their, wealth, the, mother, lulls, the, child, to, sleep, with, notes, of, triumph, over, an, enemy, reduced, to, slavery, in, 1807, the, uk, parliament, passed, the, bill, that, abolished, the, trading, of, slaves, the, king, of, bonny, now, in, nigeria, was, horrified, at, the, conclusion, of, the, practice, we, think, this, trade, must, go, on, that, is, the, verdict, of, our, oracle, and, the, priests, they, say, that, your, country, however, great, can, never, stop, a, trade, ordained, by, god, himself, after, being, marched, to, the, coast, for, sale, enslaved, people, were, held, in, large, forts, called, factories, the, amount, of, time, in, factories, varied, but, milton, meltzer, states, in, slavery, a, world, history, that, around, 4, 5, of, deaths, attributed, to, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, occurred, during, this, phase, in, other, words, over, 820, 000, people, are, believed, to, have, died, in, african, ports, such, as, benguela, elmina, and, bonny, reducing, the, number, of, those, shipped, to, 17, 5, million, after, being, captured, and, held, in, the, factories, slaves, entered, the, infamous, middle, passage, meltzer, s, research, puts, this, phase, of, the, slave, trade, s, overall, mortality, at, 12, 5, their, deaths, were, the, result, of, brutal, treatment, and, poor, care, from, the, time, of, their, capture, and, throughout, their, voyage, around, 2, 2, million, africans, died, during, these, voyages, where, they, were, packed, into, tight, unsanitary, spaces, on, ships, for, months, at, a, time, measures, were, taken, to, stem, the, onboard, mortality, rate, such, as, enforced, dancing, as, exercise, above, deck, and, the, practice, of, force, feeding, enslaved, persons, who, tried, to, starve, themselves, the, conditions, on, board, also, resulted, in, the, spread, of, fatal, diseases, other, fatalities, were, suicides, slaves, who, escaped, by, jumping, overboard, the, slave, traders, would, try, to, fit, anywhere, from, 350, to, 600, slaves, on, one, ship, before, the, african, slave, trade, was, completely, banned, by, participating, nations, in, 1853, 15, 3, million, enslaved, people, had, arrived, in, the, americas, raymond, l, cohn, an, economics, professor, whose, research, has, focused, on, economic, history, and, international, migration, has, researched, the, mortality, rates, among, africans, during, the, voyages, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, he, found, that, mortality, rates, decreased, over, the, history, of, the, slave, trade, primarily, because, the, length, of, time, necessary, for, the, voyage, was, declining, in, the, eighteenth, century, many, slave, voyages, took, at, least, 2, months, in, the, nineteenth, century, 2, months, appears, to, have, been, the, maximum, length, of, the, voyage, and, many, voyages, were, far, shorter, fewer, slaves, died, in, the, middle, passage, over, time, mainly, because, the, passage, was, shorter, despite, the, vast, profits, of, slavery, the, ordinary, sailors, on, slave, ships, were, badly, paid, and, subject, to, harsh, discipline, mortality, of, around, 20, a, number, similar, and, sometimes, greater, than, those, of, the, slaves, was, expected, in, a, ship, s, crew, during, the, course, of, a, voyage, this, was, due, to, disease, flogging, overwork, or, slave, uprisings, disease, malaria, or, yellow, fever, was, the, most, common, cause, of, death, among, sailors, a, high, crew, mortality, rate, on, the, return, voyage, was, in, the, captain, s, interests, as, it, reduced, the, number, of, sailors, who, had, to, be, paid, on, reaching, the, home, port, the, slave, trade, was, hated, by, many, sailors, and, those, who, joined, the, crews, of, slave, ships, often, did, so, through, coercion, or, because, they, could, find, no, other, employment, meltzer, also, states, that, 33, of, africans, would, have, died, in, the, first, year, at, the, seasoning, camps, found, throughout, the, caribbean, jamaica, held, one, of, the, most, notorious, of, these, camps, dysentery, was, the, leading, cause, of, death, captives, who, could, not, be, sold, were, inevitably, destroyed, around, 5, million, africans, died, in, these, camps, reducing, the, number, of, survivors, to, about, 10, million, the, purpose, of, seasoning, camps, were, to, obliterate, the, africans, identities, and, culture, and, prepare, them, for, enslavement, in, seasoning, camps, enslaved, africans, learned, a, new, language, and, adopted, new, customs, this, process, of, seasoning, slaves, took, about, two, or, three, years, over, the, colony, s, hundred, year, course, about, a, million, slaves, succumbed, to, the, conditions, of, slavery, in, haiti, a, slave, imported, into, haiti, was, expected, to, die, on, average, within, 3, years, of, arrival, and, slaves, born, on, the, island, had, a, life, expectancy, of, only, 15, years, in, the, caribbean, dutch, guiana, and, brazil, the, death, rate, of, enslaved, people, was, high, and, the, birth, rates, were, low, slaveholders, imported, more, africans, to, sustain, the, slave, population, the, rate, of, natural, decline, in, the, slave, population, ran, as, high, as, 5, percent, a, year, while, the, death, rate, of, enslaved, populations, in, the, united, states, was, the, same, on, jamaican, plantations, in, the, danish, west, indies, and, for, most, of, the, caribbean, mortality, rate, was, high, because, of, the, taxing, labor, of, sugar, cultivation, sugar, was, a, major, cash, crop, and, as, the, caribbean, plantations, exported, sugar, to, europe, and, north, america, they, needed, an, enslaved, work, force, to, make, its, production, economically, viable, so, slaves, were, imported, from, africa, enslaved, africans, lived, in, inhumane, conditions, and, the, mortality, rate, of, enslaved, children, under, the, age, of, five, was, forty, percent, many, enslaved, persons, died, from, smallpox, and, intestinal, worms, contracted, from, contaminated, food, and, water, the, atlantic, slave, trade, exportation, of, slaves, to, cuba, was, illegal, by, 1820, however, cuba, continued, to, import, enslaved, africans, from, africa, until, slavery, was, abolished, in, 1886, after, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, to, the, united, states, and, british, colonies, in, 1807, florida, imported, enslaved, africans, from, cuba, many, landing, in, amelia, island, a, clandestine, slave, ferry, operated, between, havana, cuba, and, pensacola, florida, florida, remained, under, spanish, control, until, 1821, which, made, it, difficult, for, the, united, states, to, cease, the, smuggling, of, enslaved, africans, from, cuba, in, 1821, florida, was, ceded, to, the, united, states, and, the, smuggling, of, enslaved, africans, continued, and, from, 1821, to, 1841, cuba, became, a, main, supplier, of, enslaved, africans, for, the, united, states, between, 1859, and, 1862, slave, traders, made, 40, illegal, voyages, between, cuba, and, the, united, states, the, costs, of, the, shipment, of, human, cargo, from, africa, and, operating, costs, of, the, slave, trade, from, africa, into, cuba, rose, in, the, mid, 19th, century, historian, laird, bergad, writes, of, the, cuban, slave, trade, and, slave, prices, slave, prices, on, the, african, coast, seem, to, have, remained, remarkably, stable, from, the, 1840s, through, the, mid, 1860s, although, shipping, and, operating, costs, for, slave, traders, seem, to, have, risen, considerably, in, addition, increased, bribes, to, spanish, colonial, officials, effectively, raised, operating, costs, for, slavers, these, factors, did, not, restrict, the, number, of, africans, embarking, for, cuba, nor, can, they, be, used, alone, to, explain, cuban, slave, price, rises, in, the, late, 1850s, and, early, 1860s, three, interacting, factors, produced, the, overwhelming, demand, for, slaves, responsible, for, pushing, prices, to, the, high, levels, the, first, was, the, uncertainty, surrounding, the, future, of, the, slave, trade, itself, the, long, and, persistent, british, campaign, to, force, an, end, to, the, cuban, trade, had, traditionally, been, circumvented, by, collusion, between, spanish, colonial, officials, and, cuban, slave, traders, an, additional, obstacle, to, british, efforts, was, the, unwillingness, of, the, united, states, to, permit, the, search, of, u, s, flag, vessels, suspected, of, involvement, in, the, slave, trade, by, the, mid, 1860s, prices, of, africans, in, their, elderly, years, decreased, while, prices, of, younger, africans, increased, because, they, were, considered, to, be, of, prime, working, age, according, to, research, in, 1860, in, matanzas, about, 39, 6, percent, of, slaves, sold, were, young, prime, aged, africans, of, either, sex, in, 1870, the, percentage, was, 74, 3, percent, in, addition, as, the, cost, of, sugar, increased, so, did, the, price, of, slaves, the, life, expectancy, for, brazil, s, slave, plantation, s, for, african, descended, slaves, was, around, 23, years, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, into, brazil, was, outlawed, in, 1831, to, replace, the, demand, for, slaves, slaveholders, in, brazil, turned, to, slave, reproduction, enslaved, women, were, forced, to, give, birth, to, eight, or, more, enslaved, children, some, slaveholders, promised, enslaved, women, their, freedom, if, they, gave, birth, to, eight, children, in, 1873, in, the, village, of, santa, ana, province, of, cear, an, enslaved, woman, named, mac, ria, was, promised, her, freedom, after, she, gave, birth, to, eight, children, an, enslaved, woman, delfina, killed, her, baby, because, she, did, not, want, her, enslaver, manoel, bento, da, costa, to, own, her, baby, and, enslave, her, child, brazil, practiced, partus, sequitur, ventrem, to, increase, the, slave, population, through, enslaved, female, reproduction, because, in, the, 19th, century, brazil, needed, a, large, enslaved, labor, force, to, work, on, the, sugar, plantations, in, bahia, and, the, agricultural, and, mining, industries, of, minas, gerais, s, o, paulo, and, rio, de, janeiro, after, the, abolition, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, to, brazil, the, inter, provincial, trade, increased, which, slaveholders, forced, and, depended, on, enslaved, women, to, give, birth, to, as, many, children, as, possible, to, supply, the, demand, for, slaves, abolitionists, in, brazil, wanted, to, abolish, slavery, by, removing, partus, sequitur, ventrem, because, it, was, used, to, perpetuate, slavery, for, example, historian, martha, santos, writes, of, the, slave, trade, female, reproduction, and, abolition, in, brazil, a, proposal, centered, on, the, emancipation, of, the, womb, authored, by, the, influential, jurist, and, politician, agostinho, marques, perdig, o, malheiro, was, officially, endorsed, by, pedro, ii, as, the, most, practical, means, to, end, slavery, in, a, controlled, and, peaceful, manner, this, conservative, proposal, a, modified, version, of, which, became, the, free, womb, law, passed, by, parliament, in, 1871, did, provide, for, the, freedom, of, children, subsequently, born, of, enslaved, women, while, it, forced, those, children, to, serve, their, mothers, masters, until, age, twenty, one, and, deferred, complete, emancipation, to, a, later, date,

in, the, illegal, slave, trade, and, imported, enslaved, persons, from, cuba, to, galveston, island, which, was, the, main, illegal, slave, port, in, texas, texas, was, part, of, mexico, from, 1821, until, 1836, and, cuba, continued, to, supply, african, slaves, to, many, latin, american, countries, after, 1821, the, smuggling, of, slaves, into, texas, increased, because, of, slaveholders, demand, for, additional, enslaved, labor, galveston, island, is, located, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, is, 800, miles, away, from, the, slave, ports, in, cuba, and, between, 60, and, 70, miles, away, from, the, louisiana, border, smugglers, utilized, these, geographic, locations, to, their, advantage, and, illegally, imported, enslaved, africans, from, cuba, and, made, a, profit, by, selling, africans, to, slaveholders, in, texas, and, louisiana, for, example, french, pirate, and, privateer, jean, lafitte, established, a, colony, on, galveston, island, in, 1817, and, participated, in, privateering, for, four, years, and, made, a, profit, by, smuggling, in, slaves, and, sold, over, 200, africans, to, slaveholders, in, the, united, states, lafitte, used, intermediaries, such, as, the, bowie, brothers, john, resin, and, james, who, contracted, with, slave, traders, and, planters, from, the, united, states, who, had, an, interest, in, buying, slaves, from, 1818, to, 1820, lafitte, and, the, bowie, brothers, made, 65, 000, smuggling, africans, into, the, southern, states, and, selling, them, to, planters, in, louisiana, and, mississippi, historian, ernest, obadele, starks, estimated, that, after, 1807, the, number, of, enslaved, africans, smuggled, into, the, united, states, annually, averaged, as, low, as, 3, 500, new, orleans, louisiana, and, florida, were, centers, for, the, illegal, importation, of, slaves, in, the, united, states, because, of, their, close, proximity, to, cuba, and, the, other, caribbean, islands, that, provided, southern, states, enslaved, labor, many, diseases, each, capable, of, killing, a, large, minority, or, even, a, majority, of, a, new, human, population, arrived, in, the, americas, after, 1492, they, include, smallpox, malaria, bubonic, plague, typhus, influenza, measles, diphtheria, yellow, fever, and, whooping, cough, during, the, atlantic, slave, trade, following, the, discovery, of, the, new, world, diseases, such, as, these, are, recorded, as, causing, mass, mortality, due, to, the, many, diseases, in, the, african, continent, europeans, nicknamed, sierra, leone, in, west, africa, white, man, s, grave, because, of, the, number, of, european, deaths, from, diseases, from, 1819, to, 1836, the, regions, of, africa, that, had, the, highest, european, deaths, from, malaria, were, sierra, leone, and, senegal, out, of, european, deaths, per, 1, 000, 164, 66, whites, died, from, malaria, in, senegal, and, 483, whites, died, from, malaria, in, sierra, leone, sierra, leone, had, the, highest, number, of, whites, dying, from, malaria, accounting, for, 40, percent, of, deaths, each, year, because, of, this, it, was, nicknamed, white, man, s, grave, the, phrase, white, man, s, grave, was, coined, in, the, 1830s, however, europeans, prior, to, the, creation, of, the, phrase, considered, africa, a, dangerous, environment, due, to, tropical, heat, and, the, high, death, rates, of, people, dying, from, diseases, which, was, why, the, phrase, was, created, in, the, 19th, century, malaria, thrives, in, warm, and, humid, climates, in, north, america, malaria, did, not, spread, as, much, because, certain, climatic, regions, were, not, conducive, to, the, disease, s, survival, european, american, slaveholders, preferred, africans, who, had, immunity, to, malaria, be, trafficked, to, the, slave, ports, the, price, of, africans, born, in, regions, where, malaria, was, dominate, were, higher, historian, elena, esposito, explains, by, looking, at, the, historical, prices, of, african, slaves, in, the, united, states, we, find, evidence, of, a, malaria, premium, granted, by, resistance, to, the, disease, in, fact, we, show, that, on, louisiana, plantations, more, malaria, resistant, individuals, those, born, in, regions, of, africa, with, a, higher, prevalence, of, malaria, commanded, significantly, higher, prices, evolutionary, history, may, also, have, played, a, role, in, african, people, s, resistance, to, diseases, in, the, contitent, and, indigenous, peoples, native, americans, lack, of, resistance, to, african, borne, diseases, compared, to, africans, and, europeans, new, world, populations, did, not, have, a, history, of, exposure, to, diseases, such, as, malaria, and, therefore, no, genetic, resistance, had, been, produced, as, a, result, of, adaptation, through, natural, selection, levels, and, extent, of, immunity, varies, from, disease, to, disease, for, smallpox, and, measles, for, example, those, who, survive, are, equipped, with, the, immunity, to, combat, the, disease, for, the, rest, of, their, life, in, that, they, cannot, contract, the, disease, again, there, are, also, diseases, such, as, malaria, which, do, not, confer, effective, lasting, immunity, epidemics, of, smallpox, were, known, for, causing, a, significant, decrease, in, the, indigenous, population, of, the, new, world, the, effects, on, survivors, included, pockmarks, on, the, skin, which, left, deep, scars, commonly, causing, significant, disfigurement, some, europeans, who, believed, the, plague, of, syphilis, in, europe, to, have, come, from, the, americas, saw, smallpox, as, the, european, revenge, against, the, natives, africans, and, europeans, unlike, the, native, population, often, had, lifelong, immunity, because, they, had, often, been, exposed, to, minor, forms, of, the, illness, such, as, cowpox, or, variola, minor, disease, in, childhood, by, the, late, 16th, century, there, existed, some, forms, of, inoculation, and, variolation, in, africa, and, the, middle, east, one, practice, features, arab, traders, in, africa, buying, off, the, disease, in, which, a, cloth, that, had, been, previously, exposed, to, the, sickness, was, to, be, tied, to, another, child, s, arm, to, increase, immunity, another, practice, involved, taking, pus, from, a, smallpox, scab, and, putting, it, in, the, cut, of, a, healthy, individual, in, an, attempt, to, have, a, mild, case, of, the, disease, in, the, future, rather, than, the, effects, becoming, fatal, the, trade, of, enslaved, africans, in, the, atlantic, has, its, origins, in, the, explorations, of, portuguese, mariners, down, the, coast, of, west, africa, in, the, 15th, century, before, that, contact, with, african, slave, markets, was, made, to, ransom, portuguese, who, had, been, captured, by, the, intense, north, african, barbary, pirate, attacks, on, portuguese, ships, and, coastal, villages, frequently, leaving, them, depopulated, the, first, europeans, to, use, enslaved, africans, in, the, new, world, were, the, spaniards, who, sought, auxiliaries, for, their, conquest, expeditions, and, labourers, on, islands, such, as, cuba, and, hispaniola, the, alarming, decline, in, the, native, population, had, spurred, the, first, royal, laws, protecting, them, laws, of, burgos, 1512, 13, the, first, enslaved, africans, arrived, in, hispaniola, in, 1501, after, portugal, had, succeeded, in, establishing, sugar, plantations, engenhos, in, northern, brazil, c, 1545, portuguese, merchants, on, the, west, african, coast, began, to, supply, enslaved, africans, to, the, sugar, planters, while, at, first, these, planters, had, relied, almost, exclusively, on, the, native, tupani, for, slave, labour, after, 1570, they, began, importing, africans, as, a, series, of, epidemics, had, decimated, the, already, destabilized, tupani, communities, by, 1630, africans, had, replaced, the, tupani, as, the, largest, contingent, of, labour, on, brazilian, sugar,

territory, of, british, guiana, gave, it, an, important, edge, over, all, competitors, while, many, british, did, not, make, gains, a, handful, of, individuals, made, small, fortunes, this, advantage, was, reinforced, when, france, lost, its, most, important, colony, st, domingue, western, hispaniola, now, haiti, to, a, slave, revolt, in, 1791, and, supported, revolts, against, its, rival, britain,

estimated, that, the, profits, of, the, slave, trade, and, of, west, indian, plantations, created, up, to, one, in, twenty, of, every, pound, circulating, in, the, british, economy, at, the, time, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, following, the, slavery, abolition, act, 1833, which, gradually, abolished, slavery, in, the, british, empire, the, uk,

was, not, given, to, the, formerly, enslaved, people, historian, walter, rodney, has, argued, that, at, the, start, of, the, slave, trade, in, the, 16th, century, although, there, was, a, technological, gap, between, europe, and, africa, it, was, not, very, substantial, both, continents, were, using, iron, age, technology, the, major, advantage, that, europe, had, was, in, ship, building, during, the, period, of, slavery, the, populations, of, europe, and, the, americas, grew, exponentially, while, the, population, of, africa, remained, stagnant, rodney, contended, that, the, profits, from, slavery, were, used, to, fund, economic, growth, and, technological, advancement, in, europe, and, the, americas, based, on, earlier, theories, by, eric, williams, he, asserted, that, the, industrial, revolution, was, at, least, in, part, funded, by, agricultural, profits, from, the, americas, he, cited, examples, such, as, the, invention, of, the, steam, engine, by, james, watt, which, was, funded, by, plantation, owners, from, the, caribbean, other, historians, have, attacked, both, rodney, s, methodology, and, accuracy, joseph, c, miller, has, argued, that, the, social, change, and, demographic, stagnation, which, he, researched, on, the, example, of, west, central, africa, was, caused, primarily, by, domestic, factors, joseph, inikori, provided, a, new, line, of, argument, estimating, counterfactual, demographic, developments, in, case, the, atlantic, slave, trade, had, not, existed, patrick, manning, has, shown, that, the, slave, trade, did, have, a, profound, impact, on, african, demographics, and, social, institutions, but, criticized, inikori, s, approach, for, not, taking, other, factors, such, as, famine, and, drought, into, account, and, thus, being, highly, speculative, the, effect, of, the, trade, on, african, societies, is, much, debated, due, to, the, influx, of, goods, to, africans, proponents, of, the, slave, trade, such, as, archibald, dalzel, argued, that, african, societies, were, robust, and, not, much, affected, by, the, trade, in, the, 19th, century, european, abolitionists, most, prominently, david, livingstone, took, the, opposite, view, arguing, that, the, fragile, local, economy, and, societies, were, being, severely, harmed, by, the, trade, according, to, research, from, historian, nathan, nunn, the, underdeveloped, infrastructure, and, economy, in, africa, is, a, result, of, colonization, and, the, slave, trade, nunn, wrote, africa, s, poor, economic, performance, is, a, result, of, postcolonial, state, failure, the, roots, of, which, lie, in, the, underdevelopment, and, instability, of, precolonial, polities, because, of, a, lack, of, significant, political, development, during, colonial, rule, the, limited, precolonial, political, structures, continued, to, exist, after, independence, as, a, result, africa, s, postindependence, leaders, inherited, nation, states, that, did, not, have, the, infrastructure, necessary, to, extend, authority, and, control, over, the, whole, country, many, states, were, and, still, are, unable, to, collect, taxes, from, their, citizens, and, as, a, result, they, are, also, unable, to, provide, a, minimum, level, of, public, goods, and, services, some, african, rulers, saw, an, economic, benefit, from, trading, their, subjects, with, european, slave, traders, with, the, exception, of, portuguese, controlled, angola, coastal, african, leaders, generally, controlled, access, to, their, coasts, and, were, able, to, prevent, direct, enslavement, of, their, subjects, and, citizens, thus, as, african, scholar, john, thornton, argues, african, leaders, who, allowed, the, continuation, of, the, slave, trade, likely, derived, an, economic, benefit, from, selling, their, subjects, to, europeans, the, kingdom, of, benin, for, instance, participated, in, the, african, slave, trade, at, will, from, 1715, to, 1735, surprising, dutch, traders, who, had, not, expected, to, buy, slaves, in, benin, the, benefit, derived, from, trading, slaves, for, european, goods, was, enough, to, make, the, kingdom, of, benin, rejoin, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, after, centuries, of, non, participation, such, benefits, included, military, technology, specifically, guns, and, gunpowder, gold, or, simply, maintaining, amicable, trade, relationships, with, european, nations, the, slave, trade, was, therefore, a, means, for, some, african, elites, to, gain, economic, advantages, historian, walter, rodney, estimates, that, by, c, 1770, the, king, of, dahomey, was, earning, an, estimated, 250, 000, per, year, by, selling, captive, african, soldiers, and, enslaved, people, to, the, european, slave, traders, many, west, african, countries, also, already, had, a, tradition, of, holding, slaves, which, was, expanded, into, trade, with, europeans, the, atlantic, trade, brought, new, crops, to, africa, and, more, efficient, currencies, which, were, adopted, by, the, west, african, merchants, this, can, be, interpreted, as, an, institutional, reform, which, reduced, the, cost, of, doing, business, but, the, developmental, benefits, were, limited, as, long, as, the, business, including, slaving, both, thornton, and, fage, contend, that, while, african, political, elite, may, have, ultimately, benefited, from, the, slave, trade, their, decision, to, participate, may, have, been, influenced, more, by, what, they, could, lose, by, not, participating, in, fage, s, article, slavery, and, the, slave, trade, in, the, context, of, west, african, history, he, notes, that, for, west, africans, there, were, really, few, effective, means, of, mobilizing, labour, for, the, economic, and, political, needs, of, the, state, without, the, slave, trade, historian, eric, williams, in, 1994, argued, that, the, profits, that, britain, received, from, its, sugar, colonies, or, from, the, slave, trade, between, africa, and, the, caribbean, contributed, to, the, financing, of, britain, s, industrial, revolution, however, he, says, that, by, the, time, of, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, in, 1807, and, the, emancipation, of, the, slaves, in, 1833, the, sugar, plantations, of, the, british, west, indies, had, lost, their, profitability, and, it, was, in, britain, s, economic, interest, to, emancipate, the, slaves, other, researchers, and, historians, have, strongly, contested, what, has, come, to, be, referred, to, as, the, williams, thesis, in, academia, david, richardson, has, concluded, that, the, profits, from, the, slave, trade, amounted, to, less, than, 1, of, domestic, investment, in, britain, economic, historian, stanley, engerman, finds, that, even, without, subtracting, the, associated, costs, of, the, slave, trade, e, g, shipping, costs, slave, mortality, mortality, of, british, people, in, africa, defense, costs, or, reinvestment, of, profits, back, into, the, slave, trade, the, total, profits, from, the, slave, trade, and, of, west, indian, plantations, amounted, to, less, than, 5, of, the, british, economy, during, any, year, of, the, industrial, revolution, engerman, s, 5, figure, gives, as, much, as, possible, in, terms, of, benefit, of, the, doubt, to, the, williams, argument, not, solely, because, it, does, not, take, into, account, the, associated, costs, of, the, slave, trade, to, britain, but, also, because, it, carries, the, full, employment, assumption, from, economics, and, holds, the, gross, value, of, slave, trade, profits, as, a, direct, contribution, to, britain, s, national, income, historian, richard, pares, in, an, article, written, before, williams, book, dismisses, the, influence, of, wealth, generated, from, the, west, indian, plantations, upon, the, financing, of, the, industrial, revolution, stating, that, whatever, substantial, flow, of, investment, from, west, indian, profits, into, industry, there, occurred, after, emancipation, not, before, however, each, of, these, works, focus, primarily, on, the, slave, trade, or, the, industrial, revolution, and, not, the, main, body, of, the, williams, thesis, which, was, on, sugar, and, slavery, itself, therefore, they, do, not, refute, the, main, body, of, the, williams, thesis, seymour, drescher, and, robert, anstey, argue, the, slave, trade, remained, profitable, until, the, end, and, that, moralistic, reform, not, economic, incentive, was, primarily, responsible, for, abolition, they, say, slavery, remained, profitable, in, the, 1830s, because, of, innovations, in, agriculture, however, drescher, s, econocide, wraps, up, its, study, in, 1823, and, does, not, address, the, majority, of, the, williams, thesis, which, covers, the, decline, of, the, sugar, plantations, after, 1823, the, emancipation, of, the, slaves, in, the, 1830s, and, the, subsequent, abolition, of, sugar, duties, in, the, 1840s, these, arguments, do, not, refute, the, main, body, of, the, williams, thesis, which, presents, economic, data, to, show, that, the, slave, trade, was, minor, compared, to, the, wealth, generated, by, sugar, and, slavery, itself, in, the, british, caribbean, karl, marx, in, his, influential, economic, history, of, capitalism, das, kapital, wrote, that, the, turning, of, africa, into, a, warren, for, the, commercial, hunting, of, black, skins, signaled, the, rosy, dawn, of, the, era, of, capitalist, production, he, argued, that, the, slave, trade, was, part, of, what, he, termed, the, primitive, accumulation, of, capital, the, non, capitalist, accumulation, of, wealth, that, preceded, and, created, the, financial, conditions, for, britain, s, industrialisation, the, demographic, effects, of, the, slave, trade, is, a, controversial, and, highly, debated, issue, although, scholars, such, as, paul, adams, and, erick, d, langer, have, estimated, that, sub, saharan, africa, represented, about, 18, percent, of, the, world, s, population, in, 1600, and, only, 6, percent, in, 1900, the, reasons, for, this, demographic, shift, have, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, in, addition, to, the, depopulation, africa, experienced, because, of, the, slave, trade, african, nations, were, left, with, severely, imbalanced, gender, ratios, with, females, comprising, up, to, 65, percent, of, the, population, in, hard, hit, areas, such, as, angola, moreover, many, scholars, such, as, barbara, n, ramusack, have, suggested, a, link, between, the, prevalence, of, prostitution, in, africa, today, with, the, temporary, marriages, that, were, enforced, during, the, course, of, the, slave, trade, walter, rodney, argued, that, the, export, of, so, many, people, had, been, a, demographic, disaster, which, left, africa, permanently, disadvantaged, when, compared, to, other, parts, of, the, world, and, it, largely, explains, the, continent, s, continued, poverty, he, presented, numbers, showing, that, africa, s, population, stagnated, during, this, period, while, those, of, europe, and, asia, grew, dramatically, according, to, rodney, all, other, areas, of, the, economy, were, disrupted, by, the, slave, trade, as, the, top, merchants, abandoned, traditional, industries, in, order, to, pursue, slaving, and, the, lower, levels, of, the, population, were, disrupted, by, the, slaving, itself, others, have, challenged, this, view, j, d, fage, compared, the, demographic, effect, on, the, continent, as, a, whole, david, eltis, has, compared, the, numbers, to, the, rate, of, emigration, from, europe, during, this, period, in, the, 19th, century, alone, over, 50, million, people, left, europe, for, the, americas, a, far, higher, rate, than, were, ever, taken, from, africa, other, scholars, accused, walter, rodney, of, mischaracterizing, the, trade, between, africans, and, europeans, they, argue, that, africans, or, more, accurately, african, elites, deliberately, let, european, traders, join, in, an, already, large, trade, in, enslaved, people, and, that, they, were, not, patronized, as, joseph, e, inikori, argues, the, history, of, the, region, shows, that, the, effects, were, still, quite, deleterious, he, argues, that, the, african, economic, model, of, the, period, was, very, different, from, the, european, model, and, could, not, sustain, such, population, losses, population, reductions, in, certain, areas, also, led, to, widespread, problems, inikori, also, notes, that, after, the, suppression, of, the, slave, trade, africa, s, population, almost, immediately, began, to, rapidly, increase, even, prior, to, the, introduction, of, modern, medicines, the, cultural, effects, of, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, in, africa, are, the, reduction, of, traditional, african, religious, practices, according, to, research, in, a, 2021, census, of, religions, practiced, in, ghana, published, by, the, office, of, international, religious, freedom, in, 2021, the, ghana, embassy, reported, 71, percent, of, the, population, are, christian, 20, percent, muslim, 3, percent, adhere, to, indigenous, or, animistic, religious, beliefs, and, 6, percent, belong, to, other, religious, groups, or, have, no, religious, beliefs, historian, nana, osei, bonsu, argued, that, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, not, only, took, millions, of, africans, from, the, continent, but, also, caused, a, decline, of, traditional, african, religions, and, ghanaian, indigenous, culture, as, europeans, believed, african, people, s, culture, and, religions, were, irrelevant, and, inferior, the, slave, trade, resulted, in, the, colonization, of, africa, and, its, people, forcing, many, africans, to, convert, to, christianity, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, affected, traditional, trade, routes, in, west, central, africa, africans, traded, goods, and, slaves, using, trade, routes, in, the, interior, of, africa, that, connected, to, the, sahara, desert, and, the, mediterranean, coast, where, other, commodities, and, enslaved, people, were, traded, these, trade, routes, were, used, by, africans, for, centuries, and, societies, and, kingdoms, developed, as, a, result, europeans, chose, to, trade, primarily, along, the, atlantic, coast, because, they, did, not, have, immunity, to, malaria, that, was, endemic, to, the, region, and, they, could, not, dominate, further, than, their, guns, could, fire, from, ship, or, fort, the, slave, trade, also, left, warlords, in, charge, in, african, societies, as, they, wanted, to, trade, with, europeans, to, obtain, guns, to, defeat, their, enemies, and, sell, them, to, europeans, the, european, system, of, monetization, implemented, with, the, slave, trade, replaced, cowrie, shells, the, currency, traditionally, used, among, africans, according, to, research, from, the, national, park, service, european, trade, goods, supplanted, former, african, reliance, on, indigenous, material, goods, natural, resources, and, products, as, the, economic, basis, of, their, society, at, the, same, time, europeans, increasingly, required, people, in, exchange, for, trade, goods, once, this, stage, was, reached, an, african, society, had, little, choice, but, to, trade, human, lives, for, european, goods, and, guns, guns, that, had, become, necessary, to, wage, wars, for, further, captives, in, order, to, trade, for, goods, upon, which, an, african, society, was, now, dependent, as, the, european, slave, trade, grew, more, profitable, the, demand, for, slaves, increased, which, affected, african, coastal, societies, in, the, following, ways, commerce, with, the, world, outside, africa, changed, from, overland, to, sea, and, coastal, villages, whose, main, trades, had, been, fishing, and, salt, production, became, ports, and, trading, posts, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, resulted, in, the, colonization, of, africa, colonization, in, africa, continues, to, have, negative, effects, as, some, traditional, african, cultures, are, erased, along, with, traditional, languages, and, traditional, african, religions, after, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, had, ceased, european, colonial, powers, fought, over, the, land, and, resources, in, africa, the, development, of, the, antimalarial, drug, quinine, in, 1820, enabled, europeans, to, colonize, the, interior, of, africa, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, european, powers, laid, claim, to, 90, percent, of, land, in, sub, saharan, africa, during, the, scramble, for, africa, in, this, invasion, and, subsequent, colonization, the, seven, european, powers, britain, france, germany, belgium, spain, portugal, and, italy, removed, african, kingdoms, of, power, created, national, borders, that, did, not, align, with, the, already, existing, ethnic, borders, in, africa, and, forced, diverse, tribal, ethnic, groups, to, coexist, and, be, controlled, under, one, colonial, power, this, caused, an, unnatural, division, of, people, and, was, the, groundwork, for, the, instability, in, the, african, continent, beginning, in, the, 20th, century, into, the, present, day, the, slave, forts, built, along, the, gold, coast, in, ghana, during, the, years, of, the, slave, trade, were, owned, and, used, by, the, british, colonial, administration, as, their, headquarters, well, into, the, 20th, century, british, forts, in, ghana, were, vacated, after, ghana, gained, independence, in, 1957, the, placement, of, these, forts, dislocated, african, societies, that, lived, and, fished, along, the, coast, british, colonists, used, the, fort, to, imprison, african, resistance, leaders, who, organized, resistance, movements, against, colonization, in, 1900, yaa, asantewaa, queen, mother, and, war, leader, of, the, ashanti, people, was, imprisoned, at, elmina, castle, because, she, led, a, war, against, the, british, for, possession, of, the, golden, stool, or, ashanti, royal, throne, walter, rodney, states, the, role, of, slavery, in, promoting, racist, prejudice, and, ideology, has, been, carefully, studied, in, certain, situations, especially, in, the, usa, the, simple, fact, is, that, no, people, can, enslave, another, for, four, centuries, without, coming, out, with, a, notion, of, superiority, and, when, the, colour, and, other, physical, traits, of, those, peoples, were, quite, different, it, was, inevitable, that, the, prejudice, should, take, a, racist, form, eric, williams, argued, that, a, racial, twist, given, to, what, is, basically, an, economic, phenomenon, slavery, was, not, born, of, racism, rather, racism, was, the, consequence, of, slavery, similarly, john, darwin, writes, the, rapid, conversion, from, white, indentured, labour, to, black, slavery, made, the, english, caribbean, a, frontier, of, civility, where, english, later, british, ideas, about, race, and, slave, labour, were, ruthlessly, adapted, to, local, self, interest, indeed, the, root, justification, for, the, system, of, slavery, and, the, savage, apparatus, of, coercion, on, which, its, preservation, depended, was, the, ineradicable, barbarism, of, the, slave, population, a, product, it, was, argued, of, its, african, origins, although, slavery, was, practiced, in, ancient, times, in, various, cultures, it, did, not, have, a, global, effect, like, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, and, slavery, in, the, americas, created, by, europeans, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, s, legacy, is, institutional, racism, on, an, international, scale, that, led, to, racial, discrimination, in, educational, institutions, and, public, places, in, addition, scientific, racism, was, taught, in, schools, and, some, colleges, in, the, united, states, and, europe, in, the, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, centuries, that, was, used, as, a, justification, to, enslave, africans, the, canadian, museum, for, human, rights, explained, how, european, slavery, differed, from, the, slavery, practiced, by, africans, and, native, americans, europeans, brought, a, different, kind, of, slavery, to, north, america, however, many, europeans, saw, enslaved, people, merely, as, property, to, be, bought, and, sold, this, chattel, slavery, was, a, dehumanizing, and, violent, system, of, abuse, and, subjugation, importantly, europeans, viewed, slavery, in, racist, terms, indigenous, and, african, peoples, were, seen, as, less, than, human, this, white, supremacy, justified, the, violence, of, slavery, for, hundreds, of, years, another, example, from, an, article, from, the, wall, street, journal, explained, new, world, slavery, was, a, racialized, institution, in, which, slaves, were, black, and, slave, owners, were, white, in, contrast, owners, and, slaves, in, the, old, world, were, generally, of, the, same, race, distinctions, between, enslaved, and, freeborn, people, were, often, framed, not, in, racial, terms, but, in, terms, of, language, culture, and, religion, scientific, racism, and, the, history, of, enslaving, sub, saharan, africans, led, to, anti, black, racism, that, is, seen, worldwide, in, britain, america, portugal, and, in, parts, of, europe, opposition, developed, against, the, slave, trade, david, brion, davis, says, that, abolitionists, assumed, that, an, end, to, slave, imports, would, lead, automatically, to, the, amelioration, and, gradual, abolition, of, slavery, in, britain, and, america, opposition, to, the, trade, was, led, by, members, of, the, religious, society, of, friends, quakers, thomas, clarkson, and, establishment, evangelicals, such, as, william, wilberforce, in, parliament, many, people, joined, the, movement, and, they, began, to, protest, against, the, trade, but, they, were, opposed, by, the, owners, of, the, colonial, holdings, following, lord, mansfield, s, decision, in, 1772, many, abolitionists, and, slave, holders, believed, that, slaves, became, free, upon, entering, the, british, isles, however, in, reality, occasional, instances, of, slavery, continued, in, britain, right, up, to, abolition, in, the, 1830s, the, mansfield, ruling, on, somerset, v, stewart, only, decreed, that, a, slave, could, not, be, transported, out, of, england, against, his, will, under, the, leadership, of, thomas, jefferson, the, new, u, s, state, of, virginia, in, 1778, became, the, first, slave, owning, state, and, one, of, the, first, jurisdictions, anywhere, to, stop, the, importation, of, new, slaves, for, sale, it, made, it, a, crime, for, traders, to, bring, in, slaves, from, out, of, state, or, from, overseas, for, sale, migrants, from, within, the, united, states, were, allowed, to, bring, their, own, slaves, the, new, law, freed, all, slaves, brought, in, illegally, after, its, passage, and, imposed, heavy, fines, on, violators, all, the, other, states, in, the, united, states, followed, suit, although, south, carolina, reopened, its, slave, trade, in, 1803, denmark, which, had, been, active, in, the, slave, trade, was, the, first, country, to, ban, the, trade, through, legislation, in, 1792, which, took, effect, in, 1803, britain, banned, the, slave, trade, in, 1807, imposing, stiff, fines, for, any, slave, found, aboard, a, british, ship, see, slave, trade, act, 1807, the, royal, navy, moved, to, stop, other, nations, from, continuing, the, slave, trade, and, declared, that, slaving, was, equal, to, piracy, and, was, punishable, by, death, the, united, states, congress, passed, the, slave, trade, act, of, 1794, which, prohibited, the, building, or, outfitting, of, ships, in, the, u, s, for, use, in, the, slave, trade, the, u, s, constitution, article, i, section, 9, clause, 1, barred, a, federal, prohibition, on, importing, slaves, for, 20, years, at, that, time, the, act, prohibiting, importation, of, slaves, prohibited, imports, on, the, first, day, the, constitution, permitted, january, 1, 1808, it, was, generally, thought, that, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, ended, in, 1867, but, evidence, was, later, found, of, voyages, until, 1873, quakers, began, to, campaign, against, the, british, empire, s, slave, trade, in, the, 1780s, and, from, 1789, william, wilberforce, was, a, driving, force, in, the, british, parliament, in, the, fight, against, the, trade, the, abolitionists, argued, that, the, trade, was, not, necessary, for, the, economic, success, of, sugar, in, the, british, west, indian, colonies, this, argument, was, accepted, by, wavering, politicians, who, did, not, want, to, destroy, the, valuable, and, important, sugar, colonies, of, the, british, caribbean, parliament, was, also, concerned, about, the, success, of, the, haitian, revolution, and, they, believed, they, had, to, abolish, the, trade, to, prevent, a, similar, conflagration, from, occurring, in, a, british, caribbean, colony, on, 22, february, 1807, the, house, of, commons, passed, a, motion, by, 283, votes, to, 16, to, abolish, the, atlantic, slave, trade, hence, the, slave, trade, was, abolished, but, not, the, still, economically, viable, institution, of, slavery, itself, which, provided, britain, s, most, lucrative, import, at, the, time, sugar, abolitionists, did, not, move, against, sugar, and, slavery, itself, until, after, the, sugar, industry, went, into, terminal, decline, after, 1823, the, united, states, passed, its, own, act, prohibiting, importation, of, slaves, the, next, week, march, 2, 1807, although, probably, without, mutual, consultation, the, act, only, took, effect, on, the, first, day, of, 1808, since, a, compromise, clause, in, the, us, constitution, article, 1, section, 9, clause, 1, prohibited, federal, although, not, state, restrictions, on, the, slave, trade, before, 1808, the, united, states, did, not, however, abolish, its, internal, slave, trade, which, became, the, dominant, mode, of, us, slave, trading, until, the, 1860s, in, 1805, the, british, order, in, council, had, restricted, the, importation, of, slaves, into, colonies, that, had, been, captured, from, france, and, the, netherlands, britain, continued, to, press, other, nations, to, end, its, trade, in, 1810, an, anglo, portuguese, treaty, was, signed, whereby, portugal, agreed, to, restrict, its, trade, into, its, colonies, an, 1813, anglo, swedish, treaty, whereby, sweden, outlawed, its, slave, trade, the, treaty, of, paris, 1814, where, france, agreed, with, britain, that, the, trade, is, repugnant, to, the, principles, of, natural, justice, and, agreed, to, abolish, the, slave, trade, in, five, years, the, 1814, anglo, dutch, treaty, where, the, dutch, outlawed, its, slave, trade, abolitionist, opinion, in, britain, was, strong, enough, in, 1807, to, abolish, the, slave, trade, in, all, british, possessions, although, slavery, itself, persisted, in, the, colonies, until, 1833, abolitionists, after, 1807, focused, on, international, agreements, to, abolish, the, slave, trade, foreign, minister, castlereagh, switched, his, position, and, became, a, strong, supporter, of, the, movement, britain, arranged, treaties, with, portugal, sweden, and, denmark, in, the, period, between, 1810, and, 1814, whereby, they, agreed, to, end, or, restrict, their, trading, these, were, preliminary, to, the, congress, of, vienna, negotiations, that, castlereagh, dominated, and, which, resulted, in, a, general, declaration, condemning, the, slave, trade, the, problem, was, that, the, treaties, and, declarations, were, hard, to, enforce, given, the, very, high, profits, available, to, private, interests, as, foreign, minister, castlereagh, cooperated, with, senior, officials, to, use, the, royal, navy, to, detect, and, capture, slave, ships, he, used, diplomacy, to, make, search, and, seize, agreements, with, all, the, governments, whose, ships, were, trading, there, was, serious, friction, with, the, united, states, where, the, southern, slave, interest, was, politically, powerful, washington, recoiled, at, british, policing, of, the, high, seas, spain, france, and, portugal, also, relied, on, the, international, slave, trade, to, supply, their, colonial, plantations, as, more, and, more, diplomatic, arrangements, were, made, by, castlereagh, the, owners, of, slave, ships, started, flying, false, flags, of, nations, that, had, not, agreed, especially, the, united, states, it, was, illegal, under, american, law, for, american, ships, to, engage, in, the, slave, trade, but, the, idea, of, britain, enforcing, american, laws, was, unacceptable, to, washington, lord, palmerston, and, other, british, foreign, ministers, continued, the, castlereagh, policies, eventually, in, 1842, in, 1845, an, arrangement, was, reached, between, london, and, washington, with, the, arrival, of, a, staunchly, anti, slavery, government, in, washington, in, 1861, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, doomed, in, the, long, run, castlereagh, s, strategy, on, how, to, stifle, the, slave, trade, proved, successful, prime, minister, palmerston, detested, slavery, and, in, nigeria, in, 1851, he, took, advantage, of, divisions, in, native, politics, the, presence, of, christian, missionaries, and, the, maneuvers, of, british, consul, john, beecroft, to, encourage, the, overthrow, of, king, kosoko, the, new, king, akitoye, was, a, docile, non, slave, trading, puppet, the, royal, navy, s, west, africa, squadron, established, in, 1808, grew, by, 1850, to, a, force, of, some, 25, vessels, which, were, tasked, with, combating, slavery, along, the, african, coast, between, 1807, and, 1860, the, royal, navy, s, squadron, seized, approximately, 1, 600, ships, involved, in, the, slave, trade, and, freed, 150, 000, africans, who, were, aboard, these, vessels, several, hundred, slaves, a, year, were, transported, by, the, navy, to, the, british, colony, of, sierra, leone, where, they, were, made, to, serve, as, apprentices, in, the, colonial, economy, until, the, slavery, abolition, act, 1833, even, though, it, was, prohibited, in, response, to, the, north, s, reluctance, or, refusal, to, enforce, the, fugitive, slave, act, of, 1850, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, re, open, by, way, of, retaliation, in, 1859, the, trade, in, slaves, from, africa, to, the, southern, coast, of, the, united, states, is, now, carried, on, in, defiance, of, federal, law, and, of, the, federal, government, the, last, known, slave, ship, to, land, on, u, s, soil, was, the, clotilda, which, in, 1859, illegally, smuggled, a, number, of, africans, into, the, town, of, mobile, alabama, the, africans, on, board, were, sold, as, slaves, however, slavery, in, the, u, s, was, abolished, five, years, later, following, the, end, of, the, american, civil, war, in, 1865, cudjoe, lewis, who, died, in, 1935, was, long, believed, to, be, the, last, survivor, of, clotilda, and, the, last, surviving, slave, brought, from, africa, to, the, united, states, but, recent, research, has, found, that, two, other, survivors, from, clotilda, outlived, him, redoshi, who, died, in, 1937, and, matilda, mccrear, who, died, in, 1940, however, according, to, senator, stephen, douglas, lincoln, s, opponent, in, the, lincoln, douglas, debates, in, regard, to, the, slave, trade, mr, douglas, stated, that, there, was, not, the, shadow, of, doubt, but, that, it, had, been, carried, on, quite, extensively, for, a, long, time, back, and, that, there, had, been, more, slaves, imported, into, the, southern, states, during, the, last, year, than, had, ever, been, imported, before, in, any, one, year, even, when, the, slave, trade, was, legal, it, was, his, confident, belief, that, over, 15, 000, slaves, had, been, brought, into, this, country, during, the, past, year, he, had, seen, with, his, own, eyes, three, hundred, of, these, recently, imported, miserable, beings, in, a, slave, pen, in, vicksburg, mississippi, and, also, large, numbers, at, memphis, tennessee, the, last, country, to, ban, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, brazil, a, first, law, was, approved, in, 1831, however, it, was, only, enforced, in, 1850, through, the, new, eus, bio, de, queir, s, law, despite, the, prohibition, it, took, another, three, years, for, the, trade, to, effectively, end, between, the, first, law, in, 1831, and, the, effective, ban, of, transatlantic, trade, in, 1850, an, estimated, 500, 000, africans, were, enslaved, and, illegally, trafficked, to, brazil, and, until, 1856, the, year, of, the, last, recorded, seizure, of, a, slave, ship, by, the, brazilian, authorities, around, 38, 000, africans, still, entered, the, country, as, slaves, historians, jo, o, jos, reis, sidney, chalhoub, robert, w, slenes, and, fl, vio, dos, santos, gomes, proposed, that, another, reason, for, the, abolition, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, to, brazil, was, the, mal, revolt, in, 1835, on, january, 25, 1835, an, estimated, 600, free, and, enslaved, africans, armed, with, guns, ran, through, the, streets, of, salvador, murdering, whites, and, slaveholders, abolitionists, argued, that, if, the, slave, trade, and, slavery, continued, slave, resistance, movements, would, increase, resulting, in, more, deaths, seventy, three, percent, of, the, africans, in, the, mal, revolt, were, yoruba, men, who, converted, to, islam, some, white, brazilians, believed, they, had, a, spirit, of, resistance, against, enslavement, the, historian, walter, rodney, contends, that, it, was, a, decline, in, the, profitability, of, the, triangular, trades, that, made, it, possible, for, certain, basic, human, sentiments, to, be, asserted, at, the, decision, making, level, in, a, number, of, european, countries, britain, being, the, most, crucial, because, it, was, the, greatest, carrier, of, african, captives, across, the, atlantic, rodney, states, that, changes, in, productivity, technology, and, patterns, of, exchange, in, europe, and, the, americas, informed, the, decision, by, the, british, to, end, their, participation, in, the, trade, in, 1807, nevertheless, michael, hardt, and, antonio, negri, argue, that, it, was, neither, a, strictly, economic, nor, a, moral, matter, first, because, slavery, was, in, practice, still, beneficial, to, capitalism, providing, not, only, an, influx, of, capital, but, also, disciplining, hardship, into, workers, a, form, of, apprenticeship, to, the, capitalist, industrial, plant, the, more, recent, argument, of, a, moral, shift, the, basis, of, the, previous, lines, of, this, article, is, described, by, hardt, and, negri, as, an, ideological, apparatus, in, order, to, eliminate, the, sentiment, of, guilt, in, western, society, although, moral, arguments, did, play, a, secondary, role, they, usually, had, major, resonance, when, used, as, a, strategy, to, undercut, competitors, profits, this, argument, holds, that, eurocentric, history, has, been, blind, to, the, most, important, element, in, this, fight, for, emancipation, precisely, the, constant, revolt, and, the, antagonism, of, slaves, revolts, the, most, important, of, those, being, the, haitian, revolution, the, shock, of, this, 1804, revolution, introduced, an, essential, political, argument, into, the, end, of, the, slave, trade, as, slaveholders, in, north, america, feared, a, similar, situation, could, happen, in, the, united, states, where, enslaved, people, in, the, southern, states, might, free, themselves, through, an, armed, resistance, movement, and, free, all, enslaved, people, the, success, of, enslaved, and, free, blacks, in, haiti, in, freeing, themselves, through, revolt, invoked, fear, among, many, whites, in, north, america, st, george, tucker, a, virginian, jurist, said, this, about, the, haitian, revolution, enough, to, make, one, shudder, in, fear, of, similar, calamities, in, this, country, some, white, americans, and, whites, in, the, caribbean, suggested, ending, the, slave, trade, and, slavery, to, prevent, an, uprising, like, the, one, in, haiti, a, jamaican, planter, bryan, edwards, observed, the, haitian, revolution, and, argued, that, the, enslaved, people, who, revolted, were, newly, imported, slaves, from, africa, edwards, and, other, planters, believed, the, slave, revolts, in, the, caribbean, were, instigated, by, these, new, slaves, and, some, abolitionists, suggested, ending, the, slave, trade, to, prevent, further, slave, insurrections, in, charleston, south, carolina, in, 1822, denmark, vesey, and, gullah, jack, planned, a, slave, insurrection, inspired, by, the, haitian, revolution, the, haitian, revolution, affected, france, s, colonial, economy, saint, domingue, haiti, was, france, s, wealthiest, colony, and, the, world, s, top, producer, of, sugar, and, coffee, it, was, also, a, global, leader, in, cacao, and, indigo, enslaved, labor, made, saint, domingue, the, wealthiest, colony, in, the, world, and, furnished, two, thirds, of, france, s, overseas, trade, because, of, saint, domingue, s, wealth, it, was, nicknamed, pearl, of, the, antilles, after, free, and, enslaved, people, gained, their, independence, from, france, france, and, french, slaveholders, wanted, financial, compensation, from, haiti, in, the, amount, of, 150, million, francs, to, compensate, for, their, lost, wealth, calling, it, an, independence, debt, because, france, had, lost, its, wealthiest, colony, when, haiti, gained, independence, haitians, defeated, the, french, british, and, spanish, during, the, revolution, prior, to, the, revolution, the, united, states, was, a, major, trade, partner, with, saint, domingue, after, the, revolution, the, united, states, refused, to, recognize, haiti, as, an, independent, black, nation, haiti, was, no, longer, the, main, exporter, of, sugar, after, the, revolution, cuba, became, the, main, supplier, of, sugar, to, foreign, nations, and, louisiana, became, a, center, of, sugar, production, in, the, united, states, slave, revolts, affected, the, economy, of, the, slave, trade, as, slaveholders, lost, property, in, enslaved, people, through, death, running, away, and, a, decrease, in, the, production, of, cash, crops, resulting, in, a, shift, in, trade, to, other, nations, however, both, james, stephen, and, henry, brougham, 1st, baron, brougham, and, vaux, wrote, that, the, slave, trade, could, be, abolished, for, the, benefit, of, the, british, colonies, and, the, latter, s, pamphlet, was, often, used, in, parliamentary, debates, in, favour, of, abolition, william, pitt, the, younger, argued, on, the, basis, of, these, writings, that, the, british, colonies, would, be, better, off, in, their, economic, position, as, well, as, in, their, security, if, the, trade, was, abolished, consequently, according, to, historian, christer, petley, abolitionists, argued, and, even, some, absentee, plantation, owners, accepted, that, the, trade, could, be, abolished, without, substantial, damage, to, the, plantation, economy, william, grenville, 1st, baron, grenville, argued, that, the, slave, population, of, the, colonies, could, be, maintained, without, it, petley, points, out, that, government, took, the, decision, to, abolish, the, trade, with, the, express, intention, of, improving, not, destroying, the, still, lucrative, plantation, economy, of, the, british, west, indies, in, 1787, the, british, helped, 400, freed, slaves, primarily, african, americans, freed, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, who, had, been, evacuated, to, london, to, relocate, to, sierra, leone, most, of, the, first, group, of, settlers, died, due, to, disease, and, warfare, with, indigenous, peoples, about, 64, survived, to, establish, the, second, province, of, freedom, following, the, failed, first, attempt, at, colonization, between, 1787, and, 1789, in, 1792, 1200, nova, scotian, settlers, from, nova, scotia, settled, and, established, the, colony, of, sierra, leone, and, the, settlement, of, freetown, these, were, newly, freed, african, americans, and, their, descendants, many, of, the, adults, had, left, patriot, owners, and, fought, for, the, british, in, the, revolutionary, war, the, crown, had, offered, slaves, freedom, who, left, rebel, masters, and, thousands, joined, the, british, lines, more, than, 1, 200, volunteered, to, settle, and, establish, the, new, colony, of, freetown, which, was, established, by, british, abolitionists, under, the, sierra, leone, company, in, 1816, a, group, of, wealthy, european, americans, some, of, whom, were, abolitionists, and, others, who, were, racial, segregationists, founded, the, american, colonization, society, with, the, express, desire, of, sending, liberated, african, americans, to, west, africa, in, 1820, they, sent, their, first, ship, to, liberia, and, within, a, decade, around, two, thousand, african, americans, had, been, settled, there, such, resettlement, continued, throughout, the, 19th, century, increasing, following, the, deterioration, of, race, relations, in, the, southern, states, of, the, us, following, reconstruction, in, 1877, the, american, colonization, society, s, proposal, to, send, african, americans, to, liberia, was, not, universally, popular, among, african, americans, and, the, proposal, was, seen, as, a, plot, to, weaken, the, influence, of, the, abolitionist, movement, the, scheme, was, widely, rejected, by, prominent, african, american, abolitionists, such, as, james, forten, and, frederick, douglass, the, rastafari, movement, which, originated, in, jamaica, where, 92, of, the, population, are, descended, from, the, atlantic, slave, trade, has, made, efforts, to, publicise, the, slavery, and, to, ensure, it, is, not, forgotten, especially, through, reggae, music, in, 1998, unesco, designated, 23, august, as, international, day, for, the, remembrance, of, the, slave, trade, and, its,

nations, demanded, a, clear, apology, for, slavery, from, the, former, slave, trading, countries, some, nations, were, ready, to, express, an, apology, but, the, opposition, mainly, from, the, united, kingdom, portugal, spain, the, netherlands, and, the, united, states, blocked, attempts, to, do, so, a, fear, of, monetary, compensation, might, have, been, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, opposition, as, of, 2009, efforts, are, underway, to, create, a, un, slavery, memorial, as, a, permanent, remembrance, of, the, victims, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, in, 1999, president, mathieu,

ellemann, jensen, declared, publicly, in, 1992, i, understand, why, the, inhabitants, in, the, west, indian, islands, celebrate, the, day, they, became, part, of, the, u, s, but, for, danish, people, and, denmark, the, day, is, a, dark, chapter, we, exploited, the, slaves, in, the, west, indian, islands, during, 250, years, and, made, good, money, on, them, but, when, we, had, to, pay, wages, we, sold, them, instead, without, even, asking, the, inhabitants, that, really, wasn, t, a, decent, thing, to, do, we, could, at, least, have, called, a, referendum, and, asked, people, which, nation, they, wanted, to, belong, to, instead, we, just, let, down, the, people, 69, on, 30, january, 2006, jacques, chirac, the, then, french, president, said, that, 10, may, would, henceforth, be, a,
