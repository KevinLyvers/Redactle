prehistory, also, called, pre, literary, history, is, the, period, of, human, history, between, the, first, known, use, of, stone, tools, by, hominins, c, 3, 3, million, years, ago, and, the, beginning, of, recorded, history, with, the, invention, of, writing, systems, the, use, of, symbols, marks, and, images, appears, very, early, among, humans, but, the, earliest, known, writing, systems, appeared, c, 5, 200, years, ago, it, took, thousands, of, years, for, writing, systems, to, be, widely, adopted, with, writing, having, spread, to, almost, all, cultures, by, the, 19th, century, the, end, of, prehistory, therefore, came, at, different, times, in, different, places, and, the, term, is, less, often, used, in, discussing, societies, where, prehistory, ended, relatively, recently, in, the, early, bronze, age, sumer, in, mesopotamia, the, indus, valley, civilisation, and, ancient, egypt, were, the, first, civilizations, to, develop, their, own, scripts, and, keep, historical, records, with, their, neighbours, following, most, other, civilizations, reached, their, end, of, prehistory, during, the, following, iron, age, the, three, age, division, of, prehistory, into, stone, age, bronze, age, and, iron, age, remains, in, use, for, much, of, eurasia, and, north, africa, but, is, not, generally, used, in, those, parts, of, the, world, where, the, working, of, hard, metals, arrived, abruptly, from, contact, with, eurasian, cultures, such, as, oceania, australasia, much, of, sub, saharan, africa, and, parts, of, the, americas, with, some, exceptions, in, pre, columbian, civilizations, in, the, americas, these, areas, did, not, develop, complex, writing, systems, before, the, arrival, of, eurasians, so, their, prehistory, reaches, into, relatively, recent, periods, for, example, 1788, is, usually, taken, as, the, end, of, the, prehistory, of, australia, the, period, when, a, culture, is, written, about, by, others, but, has, not, developed, its, own, writing, system, is, often, known, as, the, protohistory, of, the, culture, by, definition, there, are, no, written, records, from, human, prehistory, which, can, only, be, known, from, material, archaeological, and, anthropological, evidence, prehistoric, materials, and, human, remains, these, were, at, first, understood, by, the, collection, of, folklore, and, by, analogy, with, pre, literate, societies, observed, in, modern, times, the, key, step, to, understanding, prehistoric, evidence, is, dating, and, reliable, dating, techniques, have, developed, steadily, since, the, nineteenth, century, further, evidence, has, come, from, the, reconstruction, of, ancient, spoken, languages, more, recent, techniques, include, forensic, chemical, analysis, to, reveal, the, use, and, provenance, of, materials, and, genetic, analysis, of, bones, to, determine, kinship, and, physical, characteristics, of, prehistoric, peoples, the, beginning, of, prehistory, is, normally, taken, to, be, marked, by, human, like, beings, appearing, on, earth, the, date, marking, its, end, is, typically, defined, as, the, advent, of, the, contemporary, written, historical, record, both, dates, consequently, vary, widely, from, region, to, region, for, example, in, european, regions, prehistory, cannot, begin, before, c, 1, 3, million, years, ago, which, is, when, the, first, signs, of, human, presence, have, been, found, however, africa, and, asia, contain, sites, dated, as, early, as, c, 2, 5, and, 1, 8, million, years, ago, respectively, depending, on, the, date, when, relevant, records, become, a, useful, academic, resource, its, end, date, also, varies, for, example, in, egypt, it, is, generally, accepted, that, prehistory, ended, around, 3100, bce, whereas, in, new, guinea, the, end, of, the, prehistoric, era, is, set, much, more, recently, in, the, 1870s, when, the, russian, anthropologist, nicholai, miklukho, maklai, spent, several, years, living, among, native, peoples, and, described, their, way, of, life, in, a, comprehensive, treatise, in, europe, the, relatively, well, documented, classical, cultures, of, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, had, neighbouring, cultures, including, the, celts, and, the, etruscans, with, little, writing, historians, debate, how, much, weight, to, give, to, the, sometimes, biased, accounts, in, greek, and, roman, literature, of, these, protohistoric, cultures, in, dividing, up, human, prehistory, in, eurasia, historians, typically, use, the, three, age, system, whereas, scholars, of, pre, human, time, periods, typically, use, the, well, defined, geologic, record, and, its, internationally, defined, stratum, base, within, the, geologic, time, scale, the, three, age, system, is, the, periodization, of, human, prehistory, into, three, consecutive, time, periods, named, for, their, predominant, tool, making, technologies, stone, age, bronze, age, and, iron, age, in, some, areas, there, is, also, a, transition, period, between, stone, age, and, bronze, age, the, chalcolithic, or, copper, age, for, the, prehistory, of, the, americas, see, pre, columbian, era, the, notion, of, prehistory, emerged, during, the, enlightenment, in, the, work, of, antiquarians, who, used, the, word, primitive, to, describe, societies, that, existed, before, written, records, the, word, prehistory, first, appeared, in, english, in, 1836, in, the, foreign, quarterly, review, the, geologic, time, scale, for, pre, human, time, periods, and, the, three, age, system, for, human, prehistory, were, systematised, during, the, nineteenth, century, in, the, work, of, british, french, german, and, scandinavian, anthropologists, archaeologists, and, antiquarians, the, main, source, of, information, for, prehistory, is, archaeology, a, branch, of, anthropology, but, some, scholars, are, beginning, to, make, more, use, of, evidence, from, the, natural, and, social, sciences, the, primary, researchers, into, human, prehistory, are, archaeologists, and, physical, anthropologists, who, use, excavation, geologic, and, geographic, surveys, and, other, scientific, analysis, to, reveal, and, interpret, the, nature, and, behavior, of, pre, literate, and, non, literate, peoples, human, population, geneticists, and, historical, linguists, are, also, providing, valuable, insight, cultural, anthropologists, help, provide, context, for, societal, interactions, by, which, objects, of, human, origin, pass, among, people, allowing, an, analysis, of, any, article, that, arises, in, a, human, prehistoric, context, therefore, data, about, prehistory, is, provided, by, a, wide, variety, of, natural, and, social, sciences, such, as, anthropology, archaeology, archaeoastronomy, comparative, linguistics, biology, geology, molecular, genetics, paleontology, palynology, physical, anthropology, and, many, others, human, prehistory, differs, from, history, not, only, in, terms, of, its, chronology, but, in, the, way, it, deals, with, the, activities, of, archaeological, cultures, rather, than, named, nations, or, individuals, restricted, to, material, processes, remains, and, artefacts, rather, than, written, records, prehistory, is, anonymous, because, of, this, reference, terms, that, prehistorians, use, such, as, neanderthal, or, iron, age, are, modern, labels, with, definitions, sometimes, subject, to, debate, the, concept, of, a, stone, age, is, found, useful, in, the, archaeology, of, most, of, the, world, although, in, the, archaeology, of, the, americas, it, is, called, by, different, names, and, begins, with, a, lithic, stage, or, sometimes, paleo, indian, the, sub, divisions, described, below, are, used, for, eurasia, and, not, consistently, across, the, whole, area, palaeolithic, means, old, stone, age, and, begins, with, the, first, use, of, stone, tools, the, paleolithic, is, the, earliest, period, of, the, stone, age, it, extends, from, the, earliest, known, use, of, stone, tools, by, hominins, c, 3, 3, million, years, ago, to, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, c, 11, 650, bp, before, the, present, period, the, early, part, of, the, palaeolithic, is, called, the, lower, paleolithic, as, in, excavations, it, appears, underneath, the, upper, paleolithic, beginning, with, the, earliest, stone, tools, dated, to, around, 3, 3, million, years, ago, at, the, lomekwi, site, in, kenya, these, tools, predate, the, genus, homo, and, were, probably, used, by, kenyanthropus, evidence, of, control, of, fire, by, early, hominins, during, the, lower, palaeolithic, era, is, uncertain, and, has, at, best, limited, scholarly, support, the, most, widely, accepted, claim, is, that, h, erectus, or, h, ergaster, made, fires, between, 790, 000, and, 690, 000, bp, in, a, site, at, bnot, ya, akov, bridge, israel, the, use, of, fire, enabled, early, humans, to, cook, food, provide, warmth, have, a, light, source, deter, animals, at, night, and, meditate, early, homo, sapiens, originated, some, 300, 000, years, ago, ushering, in, the, middle, palaeolithic, anatomic, changes, indicating, modern, language, capacity, also, arise, during, the, middle, palaeolithic, during, the, middle, palaeolithic, era, there, is, the, first, definitive, evidence, of, human, use, of, fire, sites, in, zambia, have, charred, logs, charcoal, and, carbonized, plants, that, have, been, dated, to, 180, 000, bp, the, systematic, burial, of, the, dead, music, prehistoric, art, and, the, use, of, increasingly, sophisticated, multi, part, tools, are, highlights, of, the, middle, paleolithic, the, upper, paleolithic, extends, from, 50, 000, and, 12, 000, years, ago, with, the, first, organized, settlements, and, blossoming, of, artistic, work, throughout, the, palaeolithic, humans, generally, lived, as, nomadic, hunter, gatherers, hunter, gatherer, societies, tended, to, be, very, small, and, egalitarian, although, hunter, gatherer, societies, with, abundant, resources, or, advanced, food, storage, techniques, sometimes, developed, sedentary, lifestyles, with, complex, social, structures, such, as, chiefdoms, and, social, stratification, long, distance, contacts, may, have, been, established, as, in, the, case, of, indigenous, australian, highways, known, as, songlines, the, mesolithic, or, middle, stone, age, from, the, greek, mesos, middle, and, lithos, stone, was, a, period, in, the, development, of, human, technology, between, the, palaeolithic, and, neolithic, the, mesolithic, period, began, with, the, retreat, of, glaciers, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, epoch, some, 10, 000, bp, and, ended, with, the, introduction, of, agriculture, the, date, of, which, varied, by, geographic, region, in, some, areas, such, as, the, near, east, agriculture, was, already, underway, by, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, and, there, the, mesolithic, is, short, and, poorly, defined, in, areas, with, limited, glacial, impact, the, term, epipalaeolithic, is, preferred, regions, that, experienced, greater, environmental, effects, as, the, last, ice, age, ended, have, a, much, more, evident, mesolithic, era, lasting, millennia, in, northern, europe, societies, were, able, to, live, well, on, rich, food, supplies, from, the, marshlands, fostered, by, the, warmer, climate, such, conditions, produced, distinctive, human, behaviours, that, are, preserved, in, the, material, record, such, as, the, maglemosian, and, azilian, cultures, these, conditions, also, delayed, the, coming, of, the, neolithic, until, as, late, as, 4000, bce, 6, 000, bp, in, northern, europe, remains, from, this, period, are, few, and, far, between, often, limited, to, middens, in, forested, areas, the, first, signs, of, deforestation, have, been, found, although, this, would, only, begin, in, earnest, during, the, neolithic, when, more, space, was, needed, for, agriculture, the, mesolithic, is, characterized, in, most, areas, by, small, composite, flint, tools, microliths, and, microburins, fishing, tackle, stone, adzes, and, wooden, objects, such, as, canoes, and, bows, have, been, found, at, some, sites, these, technologies, first, occur, in, africa, associated, with, the, azilian, cultures, before, spreading, to, europe, through, the, iberomaurusian, culture, of, northern, africa, and, the, kebaran, culture, of, the, levant, however, independent, discovery, is, not, ruled, out, neolithic, means, new, stone, age, from, about, 10, 200, bce, in, some, parts, of, the, middle, east, but, later, in, other, parts, of, the, world, and, ended, between, 4, 500, and, 2, 000, bce, although, there, were, several, species, of, humans, during, the, paleolithic, by, the, neolithic, only, homo, sapiens, sapiens, remained, this, was, a, period, of, technological, and, social, developments, which, established, most, of, the, basic, elements, of, historical, cultures, such, as, the, domestication, of, crops, and, animals, and, the, establishment, of, permanent, settlements, and, early, chiefdoms, the, era, commenced, with, the, beginning, of, farming, which, produced, the, neolithic, revolution, it, ended, when, metal, tools, became, widespread, in, the, copper, age, or, bronze, age, or, in, some, geographical, regions, in, the, iron, age, the, term, neolithic, is, commonly, used, in, the, old, world, its, application, to, cultures, in, the, americas, and, oceania, is, complicated, by, the, fact, standard, progression, from, stone, to, metal, tools, as, seen, in, the, old, world, does, not, neatly, apply, early, neolithic, farming, was, limited, to, a, narrow, range, of, plants, both, wild, and, domesticated, which, included, einkorn, wheat, millet, and, spelt, and, the, keeping, of, dogs, sheep, and, goats, by, about, 6, 900, 6, 400, bce, it, included, domesticated, cattle, and, pigs, the, establishment, of, permanently, or, seasonally, inhabited, settlements, and, the, use, of, pottery, the, neolithic, period, saw, the, development, of, early, villages, agriculture, animal, domestication, tools, and, the, onset, of, the, earliest, recorded, incidents, of, warfare, settlements, became, more, permanent, some, with, circular, houses, made, of, mudbrick, with, a, single, room, settlements, might, have, a, surrounding, stone, wall, to, keep, domesticated, animals, in, and, hostile, tribes, out, later, settlements, have, rectangular, mud, brick, houses, where, the, family, lived, in, single, or, multiple, rooms, burial, findings, suggest, an, ancestor, cult, with, preserved, skulls, of, the, dead, the, vin, a, culture, may, have, created, the, earliest, system, of, writing, the, megalithic, temple, complexes, of, gantija, are, notable, for, their, gigantic, structures, although, some, late, eurasian, neolithic, societies, formed, complex, stratified, chiefdoms, or, even, states, states, evolved, in, eurasia, only, with, the, rise, of, metallurgy, and, most, neolithic, societies, on, the, whole, were, relatively, simple, and, egalitarian, most, clothing, appears, to, have, been, made, of, animal, skins, as, indicated, by, finds, of, large, numbers, of, bone, and, antler, pins, which, are, ideal, for, fastening, leather, wool, cloth, and, linen, might, have, become, available, during, the, later, neolithic, as, suggested, by, finds, of, perforated, stones, that, depending, on, size, may, have, served, as, spindle, whorls, or, loom, weights, in, old, world, archaeology, the, chalcolithic, eneolithic, or, copper, age, refers, to, a, transitional, period, where, early, copper, metallurgy, appeared, alongside, the, widespread, use, of, stone, tools, during, this, period, some, weapons, and, tools, were, made, of, copper, this, period, was, still, largely, neolithic, in, character, it, is, a, phase, of, the, bronze, age, before, it, was, discovered, that, adding, tin, to, copper, formed, the, harder, bronze, the, copper, age, is, seen, as, a, transition, period, between, the, stone, age, and, bronze, age, an, archaeological, site, in, serbia, contains, the, oldest, securely, dated, evidence, of, copper, making, at, high, temperature, from, 7, 500, years, ago, the, find, in, 2010, extends, the, known, record, of, copper, smelting, by, about, 800, years, and, suggests, that, copper, smelting, may, have, been, invented, independently, in, separate, parts, of, asia, and, europe, at, that, time, rather, than, spreading, from, a, single, source, the, emergence, of, metallurgy, may, have, occurred, first, in, the, fertile, crescent, where, it, gave, rise, to, the, bronze, age, in, the, 4th, millennium, bce, the, traditional, view, although, finds, from, the, vin, a, culture, in, europe, have, now, been, securely, dated, to, slightly, earlier, than, those, of, the, fertile, crescent, timna, valley, contains, evidence, of, copper, mining, 7, 000, years, ago, the, process, of, transition, from, neolithic, to, chalcolithic, in, the, middle, east, is, characterized, in, archaeological, stone, tool, assemblages, by, a, decline, in, high, quality, raw, material, procurement, and, use, north, africa, and, the, nile, valley, imported, its, iron, technology, from, the, near, east, and, followed, the, near, eastern, course, of, bronze, age, and, iron, age, development, the, bronze, age, is, the, earliest, period, in, which, some, civilizations, reached, the, end, of, prehistory, by, introducing, written, records, the, bronze, age, or, parts, thereof, are, thus, considered, to, be, part, of, prehistory, only, for, the, regions, and, civilizations, who, developed, a, system, of, keeping, written, records, during, later, periods, the, invention, of, writing, coincides, in, some, areas, with, the, beginnings, of, the, bronze, age, after, the, appearance, of, writing, people, started, creating, texts, including, written, records, of, administrative, matters, the, bronze, age, refers, to, a, period, in, human, cultural, development, when, the, most, advanced, metalworking, at, least, in, systematic, and, widespread, use, included, techniques, for, smelting, copper, and, tin, from, naturally, occurring, outcroppings, of, ores, and, then, combining, them, to, cast, bronze, these, naturally, occurring, ores, typically, included, arsenic, as, a, common, impurity, tin, ores, are, rare, as, reflected, in, the, fact, there, were, no, tin, bronzes, in, western, asia, before, 3000, bce, the, bronze, age, forms, part, of, the, three, age, system, for, prehistoric, societies, in, this, system, it, follows, the, neolithic, in, some, areas, of, the, world, while, copper, is, a, common, ore, deposits, of, tin, are, rare, in, the, old, world, and, often, had, to, be, traded, or, carried, considerable, distances, from, the, few, mines, stimulating, the, creation, of, extensive, trading, routes, in, many, areas, as, far, apart, as, china, and, england, the, valuable, new, material, was, used, for, weapons, but, for, a, long, time, apparently, not, available, for, agricultural, tools, much, of, it, seems, to, have, been, hoarded, by, social, elites, and, sometimes, deposited, in, extravagant, quantities, from, chinese, ritual, bronzes, and, indian, copper, hoards, to, european, hoards, of, unused, axe, heads, by, the, end, of, the, bronze, age, large, states, whose, armies, imposed, themselves, on, people, with, a, different, culture, and, are, often, called, empires, had, arisen, in, egypt, china, anatolia, the, hittites, and, mesopotamia, all, of, them, literate, the, iron, age, is, not, part, of, prehistory, for, all, civilizations, who, had, introduced, written, records, during, the, bronze, age, most, remaining, civilizations, did, so, during, the, iron, age, often, through, conquest, by, empires, which, continued, to, expand, during, this, period, for, example, in, most, of, europe, conquest, by, the, roman, empire, means, the, term, iron, age, is, replaced, by, roman, gallo, roman, and, similar, terms, after, the, conquest, even, before, conquest, many, areas, began, to, have, a, protohistory, as, they, were, written, about, by, literate, cultures, the, protohistory, of, ireland, is, an, example, in, archaeology, the, iron, age, refers, to, the, advent, of, ferrous, metallurgy, the, adoption, of, iron, coincided, with, other, changes, often, including, more, sophisticated, agricultural, practices, religious, beliefs, and, artistic, styles, which, makes, the, archaeological, iron, age, coincide, with, the, axial, age, in, the, history, of, philosophy, although, iron, ore, is, common, the, metalworking, techniques, necessary, to, use, iron, are, different, from, those, needed, for, the, metal, used, earlier, more, heat, is, required, once, the, technical, challenge, had, been, solved, iron, replaced, bronze, as, its, higher, abundance, meant, armies, could, be, armed, much, more, easily, with, iron, weapons, all, dates, are, approximate, and, conjectural, obtained, through, research, in, the, fields, of, anthropology, archaeology, genetics, geology, or, linguistics, they, are, all, subject, to, revision, due, to, new, discoveries, or, improved, calculations, bp, stands, for, before, present, 1950, bce, stands, for, before, common, era
