the, history, of, islam, concerns, the, political, social, economic, military, and, cultural, developments, of, the, islamic, civilization, most, historians, believe, that, islam, originated, with, muhammad, s, mission, in, mecca, and, medina, at, the, start, of, the, 7th, century, ce, although, muslims, regard, this, time, as, a, return, to, the, original, faith, passed, down, by, the, abrahamic, prophets, such, as, adam, noah, abraham, moses, david, solomon, and, jesus, with, the, submission, isl, m, to, the, will, of, god, according, to, the, traditional, account, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, began, receiving, what, muslims, consider, to, be, divine, revelations, in, 610, ce, calling, for, submission, to, the, one, god, preparation, for, the, imminent, last, judgement, and, charity, for, the, poor, and, needy, as, muhammad, s, message, began, to, attract, followers, the, a, ba, he, also, met, with, increasing, hostility, and, persecution, from, meccan, elites, in, 622, ce, muhammad, migrated, to, the, city, of, yathrib, now, known, as, medina, where, he, began, to, unify, the, tribes, of, arabia, under, islam, returning, to, mecca, to, take, control, in, 630, and, order, the, destruction, of, all, pagan, idols, by, the, time, muhammad, died, c, 11, ah, 632, ce, almost, all, the, tribes, of, the, arabian, peninsula, had, converted, to, islam, but, disagreement, broke, out, over, who, would, succeed, him, as, leader, of, the, muslim, community, during, the, rashidun, caliphate, the, early, muslim, conquests, were, responsible, for, the, spread, of, islam, by, the, 8th, century, ce, the, umayyad, caliphate, extended, from, iberian, al, andalus, in, the, west, to, the, indus, river, in, the, east, polities, such, as, those, ruled, by, the, umayyad, and, abbasid, caliphates, in, the, middle, east, and, later, in, spain, and, southern, italy, the, fatimids, seljuks, ayyubids, and, mamluks, were, among, the, most, influential, powers, in, the, world, highly, persianized, empires, built, by, the, samanids, ghaznavids, and, ghurids, significantly, contributed, to, technological, and, administrative, developments, the, islamic, golden, age, gave, rise, to, many, centers, of, culture, and, science, and, produced, notable, polymaths, astronomers, mathematicians, physicians, and, philosophers, during, the, middle, ages, by, the, early, 13th, century, the, delhi, sultanate, conquered, the, northern, indian, subcontinent, while, turkic, dynasties, like, the, sultanate, of, rum, and, artuqids, conquered, much, of, anatolia, from, the, byzantine, empire, throughout, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, destructive, mongol, invasions, along, with, the, loss, of, population, due, to, the, black, death, greatly, weakened, the, traditional, centers, of, the, muslim, world, stretching, from, persia, to, egypt, but, saw, the, emergence, of, the, timurid, renaissance, and, major, economic, powers, such, as, the, mali, empire, in, west, africa, and, the, bengal, sultanate, in, south, asia, following, the, deportation, and, enslavement, of, the, muslim, moors, from, the, emirate, of, sicily, and, elsewhere, in, southern, italy, the, islamic, iberia, was, gradually, conquered, by, christian, forces, during, the, reconquista, nonetheless, in, the, early, modern, period, the, gunpowder, empires, the, ottomans, timurids, mughals, and, safavids, emerged, as, world, powers, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, most, of, the, muslim, world, fell, under, the, influence, or, direct, control, of, the, european, great, powers, some, of, their, efforts, to, win, independence, and, build, modern, nation, states, over, the, course, of, the, last, two, centuries, continue, to, reverberate, to, the, present, day, as, well, as, fuel, conflict, zones, in, regions, such, as, palestine, kashmir, xinjiang, chechnya, central, africa, bosnia, and, myanmar, the, oil, boom, stabilized, the, arab, states, of, the, gulf, cooperation, council, comprising, bahrain, kuwait, oman, qatar, saudi, arabia, and, the, united, arab, emirates, making, them, the, world, s, largest, oil, producers, and, exporters, which, focus, on, capitalism, free, trade, and, tourism, the, study, of, the, earliest, periods, in, islamic, history, is, made, difficult, by, a, lack, of, sources, for, example, the, most, important, historiographical, source, for, the, origins, of, islam, is, the, work, of, al, tabari, while, al, tabari, is, considered, an, excellent, historian, by, the, standards, of, his, time, and, place, he, made, liberal, use, of, mythical, legendary, stereotyped, distorted, and, polemical, presentations, of, subject, matter, which, are, however, considered, to, be, islamically, acceptable, and, his, descriptions, of, the, beginning, of, islam, post, date, the, events, by, several, generations, al, tabari, having, died, in, 923, ce, differing, views, about, how, to, deal, with, the, available, sources, has, led, to, the, development, of, four, different, approaches, to, the, history, of, early, islam, all, four, methods, have, some, level, of, support, today, nowadays, the, popularity, of, the, different, methods, employed, varies, on, the, scope, of, the, works, under, consideration, for, overview, treatments, of, the, history, of, early, islam, the, descriptive, approach, is, more, popular, for, scholars, who, look, at, the, beginnings, of, islam, in, depth, the, source, critical, and, tradition, critical, methods, are, more, often, followed, after, the, 8th, century, ce, the, quality, of, sources, improves, those, sources, which, treated, earlier, times, with, a, large, temporal, and, cultural, gap, now, begin, to, give, accounts, which, are, more, contemporaneous, the, quality, of, genre, of, available, historical, accounts, improves, and, new, documentary, sources, such, as, official, documents, correspondence, and, poetry, appear, for, the, time, prior, to, the, beginning, of, islam, in, the, 6th, century, ce, sources, are, superior, as, well, if, still, of, mixed, quality, in, particular, the, sources, covering, the, sasanian, realm, of, influence, in, the, 6th, century, ce, are, poor, while, the, sources, for, byzantine, areas, at, the, time, are, of, a, respectable, quality, and, complemented, by, syriac, christian, sources, for, syria, and, iraq, until, the, early, 1970s, non, muslim, scholars, of, islamic, studies, while, not, accepting, accounts, of, divine, intervention, did, accept, its, origin, story, in, most, of, its, details, on, the, dates, said, historians, called, revisionist, school, of, islamic, studies, began, to, use, relevant, archaeology, epigraphy, numismatics, and, contemporary, non, arabic, literature, to, crosscheck, writings, from, 150, to, 250, years, after, muhammad, the, school, included, scholars, such, as, john, wansbrough, and, his, students, andrew, rippin, norman, calder, g, r, hawting, patricia, crone, and, michael, cook, as, well, as, g, nter, l, ling, yehuda, d, nevo, and, christoph, luxenberg, these, studies, yielded, the, following, results, the, following, timeline, can, serve, as, a, rough, visual, guide, to, the, most, important, polities, in, the, islamic, world, prior, to, world, war, i, it, covers, major, historical, centers, of, power, and, culture, including, the, arabian, peninsula, modern, day, oman, saudi, arabia, united, arab, emirates, and, yemen, mesopotamia, modern, day, iraq, persia, modern, day, iran, levant, modern, day, syria, lebanon, jordan, and, israel, palestine, egypt, the, maghreb, north, west, africa, the, sahel, the, swahili, coast, somalia, southern, iberia, al, andalus, transoxania, central, asia, hindustan, including, modern, day, north, india, bangladesh, and, pakistan, and, anatolia, modern, day, turkey, it, is, necessarily, an, approximation, since, rule, over, some, regions, was, sometimes, divided, among, different, centers, of, power, and, authority, in, larger, polities, was, often, distributed, among, several, dynasties, for, example, during, the, later, stages, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, even, the, capital, city, of, baghdad, was, effectively, ruled, by, other, dynasties, such, as, the, buyyids, and, the, seljuks, while, the, ottoman, turks, commonly, delegated, executive, authority, over, outlying, provinces, to, local, potentates, such, as, the, deys, of, algiers, the, beys, of, tunis, and, the, mamluks, of, iraq, early, islam, arose, within, the, historical, social, political, economic, and, religious, context, of, late, antiquity, in, the, middle, east, the, second, half, of, the, 6th, century, ce, saw, political, disorder, in, the, pre, islamic, arabian, peninsula, and, communication, routes, were, no, longer, secure, religious, divisions, played, an, important, role, in, the, crisis, judaism, became, the, dominant, religion, of, the, himyarite, kingdom, in, yemen, after, about, 380, ce, while, christianity, took, root, in, the, persian, gulf, there, was, also, a, yearning, for, a, more, spiritual, form, of, religion, and, the, choice, of, religion, increasingly, became, an, individual, rather, than, a, collective, issue, while, some, arabs, were, reluctant, to, convert, to, a, foreign, faith, those, abrahamic, religions, provided, the, principal, intellectual, and, spiritual, reference, points, and, jewish, and, christian, loanwords, from, aramaic, began, to, replace, the, old, pagan, vocabulary, of, arabic, throughout, the, peninsula, the, an, f, renunciates, a, group, of, monotheists, that, sought, to, separate, themselves, both, from, the, foreign, abrahamic, religions, and, the, traditional, arab, polytheism, were, looking, for, a, new, religious, worldview, to, replace, the, pre, islamic, arabian, religions, focusing, on, the, all, encompassing, father, god, allah, whom, they, freely, equated, with, the, jewish, yahweh, and, the, christian, jehovah, in, their, view, mecca, was, originally, dedicated, to, this, monotheistic, faith, that, they, considered, to, be, the, one, true, religion, established, by, the, patriarch, abraham, according, to, the, traditional, account, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, was, born, in, mecca, an, important, caravan, trading, center, around, the, year, 570, ce, his, family, belonged, to, the, arab, clan, of, quraysh, which, was, the, chief, tribe, of, mecca, and, a, dominant, force, in, western, arabia, to, counter, the, effects, of, anarchy, particularly, raiding, for, booty, between, tribes, they, upheld, the, institution, of, sacred, months, when, all, violence, was, forbidden, and, travel, was, safe, the, polytheistic, kaaba, shrine, in, mecca, and, the, surrounding, area, was, a, popular, pilgrimage, destination, for, surrounding, arabs, which, was, a, significant, source, of, revenue, for, the, city, most, likely, muhammad, was, intimately, aware, of, jewish, belief, and, practices, and, acquainted, with, the, an, f, like, the, an, f, muhammad, practiced, ta, annuth, spending, time, in, seclusion, at, mount, hira, and, turning, away, from, paganism, when, he, was, about, 40, years, old, he, began, receiving, at, mount, hira, what, muslims, regard, as, divine, revelations, delivered, through, the, angel, gabriel, which, would, later, form, the, quran, these, inspirations, urged, him, to, proclaim, a, strict, monotheistic, faith, as, the, final, expression, of, biblical, prophetism, earlier, codified, in, the, sacred, texts, of, judaism, and, christianity, to, warn, his, compatriots, of, the, impending, judgement, day, and, to, castigate, social, injustices, of, his, city, muhammad, s, message, won, over, a, handful, of, followers, the, a, ba, and, was, met, with, increasing, persecution, from, meccan, notables, in, 622, ce, a, few, years, after, losing, protection, with, the, death, of, his, influential, uncle, ab, lib, ibn, abd, al, mu, alib, muhammad, migrated, to, the, city, of, yathrib, subsequently, called, medina, where, he, was, joined, by, his, followers, later, generations, would, count, this, event, known, as, the, hijra, as, the, start, of, the, islamic, era, in, yathrib, where, he, was, accepted, as, an, arbitrator, among, the, different, communities, of, the, city, under, the, terms, of, the, constitution, of, medina, muhammad, began, to, lay, the, foundations, of, the, new, islamic, society, with, the, help, of, new, quranic, verses, which, provided, guidance, on, matters, of, law, and, religious, observance, the, surahs, of, this, period, emphasized, his, place, among, the, long, line, of, biblical, prophets, but, also, differentiated, the, message, of, the, quran, from, the, sacred, texts, of, christianity, and, judaism, armed, conflict, with, the, arab, meccans, and, jewish, tribes, of, the, yathrib, area, soon, broke, out, after, a, series, of, military, confrontations, and, political, manoeuvres, muhammad, was, able, to, secure, control, of, mecca, and, allegiance, of, the, quraysh, in, 629, ce, in, the, time, remaining, until, his, death, in, 632, ce, tribal, chiefs, across, the, arabian, peninsula, entered, into, various, agreements, with, him, some, under, terms, of, alliance, others, acknowledging, his, claims, of, prophethood, and, agreeing, to, follow, islamic, practices, including, paying, the, alms, levy, to, his, government, which, consisted, of, a, number, of, deputies, an, army, of, believers, and, a, public, treasury, the, real, intentions, of, muhammad, regarding, the, spread, of, islam, its, political, undertone, and, his, missionary, activity, da, wah, during, his, lifetime, are, a, contentious, matter, of, debate, which, has, been, extensively, discussed, both, among, muslim, scholars, and, non, muslim, scholars, within, the, academic, field, of, islamic, studies, various, authors, islamic, activists, and, historians, of, islam, have, proposed, several, understandings, of, muhammad, s, intent, and, ambitions, regarding, his, religio, political, mission, in, the, context, of, the, pre, islamic, arabian, society, and, the, founding, of, his, own, religion, was, it, in, muhammad, s, mind, to, produce, a, world, religion, or, did, his, interests, lie, mainly, within, the, confines, of, his, homeland, was, he, solely, an, arab, nationalist, a, political, genius, intent, upon, uniting, the, proliferation, of, tribal, clans, under, the, banner, of, a, new, religion, or, was, his, vision, a, truly, international, one, encompassing, a, desire, to, produce, a, reformed, humanity, in, the, midst, of, a, new, world, order, these, questions, are, not, without, significance, for, a, number, of, the, proponents, of, contemporary, da, wah, activity, in, the, west, trace, their, inspiration, to, the, prophet, himself, claiming, that, he, initiated, a, worldwide, missionary, program, in, which, they, are, the, most, recent, participants, despite, the, claims, of, these, and, other, writers, it, is, difficult, to, prove, that, muhammad, intended, to, found, a, world, encompassing, faith, superseding, the, religions, of, christianity, and, judaism, his, original, aim, appears, to, have, been, the, establishment, of, a, succinctly, arab, brand, of, monotheism, as, indicated, by, his, many, references, to, the, qur, n, as, an, arab, book, and, by, his, accommodations, to, other, monotheistic, traditions, after, the, death, of, muhammad, in, 632, ce, his, community, needed, to, appoint, a, new, leader, giving, rise, to, the, title, of, caliph, arabic, romanized, khal, fa, lit, successor, thus, the, subsequent, islamic, empires, were, known, as, caliphates, and, a, series, of, four, caliphs, governed, the, early, islamic, empire, ab, bakr, 632, 634, umar, ibn, al, kha, b, umar, 634, 644, uthm, n, ibn, aff, n, 644, 656, and, al, ibn, ab, lib, 656, 661, these, leaders, are, known, as, the, r, shid, n, rightly, guided, caliphs, in, sunn, islam, they, oversaw, the, initial, phase, of, the, early, muslim, conquests, advancing, through, persia, the, levant, egypt, and, north, africa, alongside, the, growth, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, the, major, political, development, within, early, islam, in, this, period, was, the, sectarian, split, and, political, divide, between, kharijite, sunn, and, sh, a, muslims, this, had, its, roots, in, a, dispute, over, the, succession, for, the, role, of, caliph, sunn, s, believed, the, caliph, was, elective, and, any, muslim, from, the, arab, clan, of, quraysh, the, tribe, of, muhammad, might, serve, as, one, sh, tes, on, the, other, hand, believed, the, title, of, caliph, should, be, hereditary, in, the, bloodline, of, muhammad, and, thus, all, the, caliphs, with, the, exceptions, of, muhammad, s, cousin, and, son, in, law, al, ibn, ab, lib, and, his, firstborn, son, asan, were, actually, illegitimate, usurpers, however, the, sunn, sect, emerged, as, triumphant, in, most, regions, of, the, muslim, world, with, the, exceptions, of, iran, and, oman, muhammad, s, closest, companions, a, ba, the, four, rightly, guided, caliphs, who, succeeded, him, continued, to, expand, the, islamic, empire, to, encompass, jerusalem, ctesiphon, and, damascus, and, sending, arab, muslim, armies, as, far, as, the, sindh, region, the, early, islamic, empire, stretched, from, al, andalus, muslim, iberia, to, the, punjab, region, under, the, reign, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, after, muhammad, s, death, ab, bakr, one, of, his, closest, associates, was, chosen, as, the, first, caliph, successor, although, the, office, of, caliph, retained, an, aura, of, religious, authority, it, laid, no, claim, to, prophecy, a, number, of, tribal, arab, leaders, refused, to, extend, the, agreements, made, with, muhammad, to, ab, bakr, ceasing, payments, of, the, alms, levy, and, in, some, cases, claiming, to, be, prophets, in, their, own, right, ab, bakr, asserted, his, authority, in, a, successful, military, campaign, known, as, the, ridda, wars, whose, momentum, was, carried, into, the, lands, of, the, byzantine, and, sasanian, empires, by, the, end, of, the, reign, of, the, second, caliph, umar, ibn, al, kha, b, the, arab, muslim, armies, whose, battle, hardened, ranks, were, now, swelled, by, the, defeated, rebels, and, former, imperial, auxiliary, troops, invaded, the, eastern, byzantine, provinces, of, syria, and, egypt, while, the, sasanids, lost, their, western, territories, with, the, rest, of, persia, to, follow, soon, afterwards, umar, ibn, al, kha, b, improved, the, administration, of, the, fledgling, islamic, empire, ordering, improvement, of, irrigation, networks, and, playing, a, role, in, foundation, of, cities, like, basra, to, be, close, to, the, poor, he, lived, in, a, simple, mud, hut, without, doors, and, walked, the, streets, every, evening, after, consulting, with, the, poor, umar, established, the, bayt, al, mal, a, welfare, institution, for, the, muslim, and, non, muslim, poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and, the, disabled, the, bayt, al, mal, ran, for, hundreds, of, years, under, the, r, shid, n, caliphate, in, the, 7th, century, ce, and, continued, through, the, umayyad, period, and, well, into, the, abbasid, era, umar, also, introduced, child, benefit, for, the, children, and, pensions, for, the, elderly, when, he, felt, that, a, governor, or, a, commander, was, becoming, attracted, to, wealth, or, did, not, meet, the, required, administrative, standards, he, had, him, removed, from, his, position, the, expansion, was, partially, halted, between, 638, and, 639, ce, during, the, years, of, great, famine, and, plague, in, arabia, and, the, levant, respectively, but, by, the, end, of, umar, s, reign, syria, egypt, mesopotamia, and, much, of, persia, were, incorporated, into, the, early, islamic, empire, local, populations, of, jews, and, indigenous, christians, who, lived, as, religious, minorities, and, were, forced, to, pay, the, jizya, tax, under, the, muslim, rule, in, order, to, finance, the, wars, with, byzantines, and, sasanids, often, aided, muslims, to, take, over, their, lands, from, the, byzantines, and, persians, resulting, in, exceptionally, speedy, conquests, as, new, areas, were, conquered, they, also, benefited, from, free, trade, with, other, areas, of, the, growing, islamic, empire, where, to, encourage, commerce, taxes, were, applied, to, wealth, rather, than, trade, the, muslims, paid, zakat, on, their, wealth, for, the, benefit, of, the, poor, since, the, constitution, of, medina, drafted, by, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, the, jews, and, the, christians, continued, to, use, their, own, laws, and, had, their, own, judges, in, 639, ce, umar, appointed, muawiyah, ibn, abi, sufyan, as, the, governor, of, syria, after, the, previous, governor, died, in, a, plague, along, with, 25, 000, other, people, to, stop, the, byzantine, harassment, from, the, sea, during, the, arab, byzantine, wars, in, 649, muawiyah, set, up, a, navy, with, ships, crewed, by, monophysite, christians, egyptian, coptic, christians, and, jacobite, syrian, christians, sailors, and, muslim, troops, which, defeated, the, byzantine, navy, at, the, battle, of, the, masts, in, 655, ce, opening, up, the, mediterranean, sea, to, muslim, ships, early, muslim, armies, stayed, in, encampments, away, from, cities, because, umar, feared, that, they, may, get, attracted, to, wealth, and, luxury, moving, away, from, the, worship, of, god, accumulating, wealth, and, establishing, dynasties, staying, in, these, encampments, away, from, the, cities, also, ensured, that, there, was, no, stress, on, the, local, populations, which, could, remain, autonomous, some, of, these, encampments, later, grew, into, cities, like, basra, and, kufa, in, iraq, and, fustat, in, egypt, when, umar, was, assassinated, in, 644, ce, uthm, n, ibn, aff, n, second, cousin, and, twice, son, in, law, of, muhammad, became, the, third, caliph, as, the, arabic, language, is, written, without, vowels, speakers, of, different, arabic, dialects, and, other, languages, recited, the, quran, with, phonetic, variations, that, could, alter, the, meaning, of, the, text, when, uthm, n, became, aware, of, this, he, ordered, a, standard, copy, of, the, quran, to, be, prepared, begun, during, his, reign, the, compilation, of, the, quran, was, finished, some, time, between, 650, and, 656, ce, and, copies, were, sent, out, to, the, different, centers, of, the, expanding, islamic, empire, after, muhammad, s, death, the, old, tribal, differences, between, the, arabs, started, to, resurface, following, the, roman, persian, wars, and, the, byzantine, sasanian, wars, deep, rooted, differences, between, iraq, formerly, under, the, sasanian, empire, and, syria, formerly, under, the, byzantine, empire, also, existed, each, wanted, the, capital, of, the, newly, established, islamic, empire, to, be, in, their, area, as, uthm, n, became, very, old, marwan, i, a, relative, of, muawiyah, slipped, into, the, vacuum, becoming, his, secretary, and, slowly, assuming, more, control, when, uthm, n, was, assassinated, in, 656, ce, al, ibn, ab, lib, cousin, and, son, in, law, of, muhammad, assumed, the, position, of, caliph, and, moved, the, capital, to, kufa, in, iraq, muawiyah, i, the, governor, of, syria, and, marwan, i, demanded, arrest, of, the, culprits, marwan, i, manipulated, every, one, and, created, conflict, which, resulted, in, the, first, muslim, civil, war, the, first, fitna, al, was, assassinated, by, the, kharijites, in, 661, ce, six, months, later, al, s, firstborn, son, asan, made, a, peace, treaty, with, muawiyah, i, in, the, interest, of, peace, in, the, hasan, muawiya, treaty, asan, ibn, al, handed, over, power, to, muawiyah, i, on, the, condition, that, he, would, be, just, to, the, people, and, not, establish, a, dynasty, after, his, death, muawiyah, i, subsequently, broke, the, conditions, of, the, agreement, and, established, the, umayyad, dynasty, with, a, capital, in, damascus, usayn, ibn, al, by, then, muhammad, s, only, surviving, grandson, refused, to, swear, allegiance, to, the, umayyads, he, was, killed, in, the, battle, of, karbala, the, same, year, in, an, event, still, mourned, by, sh, a, muslims, on, the, day, of, ashura, political, unrest, called, the, second, muslim, civil, war, the, second, fitna, continued, but, muslim, rule, was, extended, under, muawiyah, i, to, rhodes, crete, kabul, bukhara, and, samarkand, and, expanded, into, north, africa, in, 664, ce, arab, muslim, armies, conquered, kabul, and, in, 665, ce, pushed, further, into, the, maghreb, the, umayyad, dynasty, or, ommiads, whose, name, derives, from, umayya, ibn, abd, shams, the, great, grandfather, of, the, first, umayyad, caliph, ruled, from, 661, to,

and, abu, bakr, rumi, were, favourably, impressed, by, the, mongols, conquest, of, islamic, states, and, subjugation, of, muslim, rulers, to, their, military, and, political, power, considering, their, invasions, and, expansion, as, a, legitimate, divine, punishment, from, god, as, the, mongols, and, turkic, peoples, from, the, eurasian, steppe, were, regarded, as, more, pious, than, the,

for, muslim, believers, to, understand, the, unseen, al, ghaib, p24, a, sharp, distinction, between, sunn, sh, a, and, heterodox, islamic, beliefs, did, not, exist, therefore, ideas, from, foreign, cultures, were, easier, to, integrate, into, the, islamic, worldview, while, many, scholars, had, hold, the, opinion, that, turks, and, mongols, converted, to, islam, filtered, through, the, mediation, of, persian, and, central, asian, culture, as, well, as, through, the, preaching, of, sufi, muslim, wandering, ascetics, and, mystics, fakirs, and, dervishes, this, view, has, been,

the, mongol, empire, during, the, mongol, invasions, of, the, levant, in, the, 1260s, the, mongols, sacked, and, controlled, the, islamic, near, east, territories, the, mongol, invaders, were, finally, stopped, by, egyptian, mamluks, north, of, jerusalem, in, 1260, at, the, pivotal, battle, of, ain, jalut, the, mamluks, who, were, slave, soldiers, predominantly, of, turkic, caucasian, and,

by, the, mamluks, at, the, battle, of, hims, a, few, months, later, and, then, driven, out, of, syria, altogether, with, this, the, mamluks, were, able, to, concentrate, their, forces, and, to, conquer, the, last, of, the, crusader, states, in, the, levant, thus, they, united, syria, and, egypt, for, the, longest, interval, between, the, abbasid, and, ottoman, empires, 1250, 1517, the,

1328, who, did, not, accept, the, mongols, conversion, to, sunnism, worried, about, the, integrity, of, islam, and, tried, to, establish, a, theological, doctrine, to, purify, islam, from, its, alleged, alterations, unlike, contemporary, scholarship, which, relied, on, traditions, and, historical, narratives, from, early, islam, ibn, taymiyya, s, methodology, was, a, mixture, of, the, selective, use, of, hadith, and, a, literal, understanding, of, the, quran, he, rejected, most, philosophical, approaches, to, islam, and, proposed, a, clear, simple, and, dogmatic, theology, instead, another, major, characteristic, of, his, theological, approach, emphasized, the, significance, of, a, theocratic, state, while, prevailing, opinion, held, that, religious, wisdom, was, necessary, for, a, state, ibn, taymiyya, regarded, political, power, as, necessary, for, religious, excellence, he, rejected, many, hadiths, circulating, among, muslims, during, his, time, and, relied, repeatedly, on, only, sahih, bukhari, and, sahih, muslim, to, refute, asharite, doctrine, feeling, threatened, by, the, crusaders, and, by, the, mongols, ibn, taymiyya, stated, it, would, be, obligatory, for, muslims, to, join, a, physical, jihad, against, non, muslims, this, not, only, included, the, invaders, but, also, the, heretics, among, the, muslims, including, shias, asharites, and, philosophers, who, ibn, taymiyya, blamed, for, the, deterioration, of, islam, nevertheless, his, writings, only, played, a, marginal, role, during, his, lifetime, he, was, repeatedly, accused, of, blasphemy, by, anthropomorphizing, god, and, his, disciple, ibn, kathir, distanced, himself, from, his, mentor, and, negated, that, aspect, of, his, teachings, yet, some, of, ibn, taymiyya, s, teaching, probably, influenced, ibn, kathir, s, methodology, on, exegesis, in, his, tafsir, which, discounted, much, of, the, exegetical, tradition, since, then, the, writings, of, ibn, taymiyya, and, ibn, kathir, became, important, sources, for, wahhabism, and, 21st, century, salafi, theology, the, arabs, under, the, command, of, the, berber, general, tarik, ibn, ziyad, first, began, their, conquest, of,
