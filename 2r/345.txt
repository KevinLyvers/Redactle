the, seven, years, war, 1756, 1763, was, a, global, conflict, involving, most, of, the, european, great, powers, fought, primarily, in, europe, and, the, americas, one, of, the, opposing, alliances, was, led, by, great, britain, and, prussia, the, other, alliance, was, led, by, france, backed, by, spain, saxony, sweden, and, russia, related, conflicts, include, the, 1754, to, 1763, french, and, indian, war, and, 1762, to, 1763, anglo, spanish, war, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, ended, in, 1748, but, failed, to, resolve, ongoing, tensions, between, the, european, powers, continuing, colonial, disputes, between, britain, and, france, in, north, america, resulted, in, the, outbreak, of, the, french, and, indian, war, in, 1754, following, the, realignment, of, traditional, alliances, in, the, so, called, 1756, diplomatic, revolution, prussia, allied, with, britain, while, the, long, running, french, habsburg, rivalry, ended, when, austria, signed, a, treaty, with, france, spain, entered, the, war, on, the, french, side, in, 1762, unsuccessfully, attempting, to, invade, britain, s, ally, portugal, in, what, became, known, as, the, fantastic, war, spain, lost, havana, in, cuba, and, manila, in, the, philippines, to, britain, but, they, were, returned, in, the, 1763, treaty, of, paris, in, europe, the, large, scale, conflict, that, drew, in, most, of, the, european, powers, was, centred, on, the, desire, of, austria, to, recover, silesia, from, prussia, the, treaty, of, hubertusburg, ended, the, war, between, saxony, austria, and, prussia, in, 1763, france, s, supremacy, in, europe, was, halted, while, prussia, confirmed, its, status, as, a, great, power, challenging, austria, for, dominance, within, the, holy, roman, empire, thus, altering, the, european, balance, of, power, in, the, historiography, of, some, countries, the, war, is, named, after, combatants, in, its, respective, theatres, in, the, present, day, united, states, the, conflict, is, known, as, the, french, and, indian, war, 1754, 1763, in, english, speaking, canada, the, balance, of, britain, s, former, north, american, colonies, it, is, called, the, seven, years, war, 1756, 1763, in, french, speaking, canada, it, is, known, as, la, guerre, de, la, conqu, te, the, war, of, the, conquest, swedish, historiography, uses, the, name, pommerska, kriget, the, pomeranian, war, as, the, sweden, prussia, conflict, between, 1757, and, 1762, was, limited, to, pomerania, in, northern, central, germany, the, third, silesian, war, involved, prussia, and, austria, 1756, 1763, on, the, indian, subcontinent, the, conflict, is, called, the, third, carnatic, war, 1757, 1763, the, term, second, hundred, years, war, has, been, used, in, order, to, describe, the, almost, continuous, level, of, worldwide, conflict, between, france, and, great, britain, during, the, entire, 18th, century, reminiscent, of, the, hundred, years, war, of, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, the, boundary, between, british, and, french, possessions, in, north, america, was, largely, undefined, in, the, 1750s, france, had, long, claimed, the, entire, mississippi, river, basin, this, was, disputed, by, britain, in, the, early, 1750s, the, french, began, constructing, a, chain, of, forts, in, the, ohio, river, valley, to, assert, their, claim, and, shield, the, native, american, population, from, increasing, british, influence, the, british, settlers, along, the, coast, were, upset, that, french, troops, would, now, be, close, to, the, western, borders, of, their, colonies, they, felt, the, french, would, encourage, their, tribal, allies, among, the, north, american, natives, to, attack, them, also, the, british, settlers, wanted, access, to, the, fertile, land, of, the, ohio, river, valley, for, the, new, settlers, that, were, flooding, into, the, british, colonies, seeking, farm, land, the, most, important, french, fort, planned, was, intended, to, occupy, a, position, at, the, forks, where, the, allegheny, and, monongahela, rivers, meet, to, form, the, ohio, river, in, present, day, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, peaceful, british, attempts, to, halt, this, fort, construction, were, unsuccessful, and, the, french, proceeded, to, build, the, fort, they, named, fort, duquesne, british, colonial, militia, from, virginia, accompanied, by, chief, tanacharison, and, a, small, number, of, mingo, warriors, were, sent, to, drive, them, out, led, by, george, washington, they, ambushed, a, small, french, force, at, jumonville, glen, on, 28, may, 1754, killing, ten, including, commander, joseph, coulon, de, jumonville, the, french, retaliated, by, attacking, washington, s, army, at, fort, necessity, on, 3, july, 1754, and, forced, washington, to, surrender, these, were, the, first, engagements, of, what, would, become, the, worldwide, seven, years, war, britain, and, france, failed, to, negotiate, a, solution, after, receiving, news, about, this, in, europe, the, two, countries, eventually, sent, regular, troops, to, north, america, to, enforce, their, claims, the, first, british, action, was, the, assault, on, acadia, on, 16, june, 1755, in, the, battle, of, fort, beaus, jour, which, was, immediately, followed, by, their, expulsion, of, the, acadians, in, july, british, major, general, edward, braddock, led, about, 2, 000, army, troops, and, provincial, militia, on, an, expedition, to, retake, fort, duquesne, but, the, expedition, ended, in, disastrous, defeat, in, further, action, admiral, edward, boscawen, fired, on, the, french, ship, alcide, on, 8, june, 1755, capturing, it, and, two, troop, ships, in, september, 1755, british, colonial, and, french, troops, met, in, the, inconclusive, battle, of, lake, george, the, british, also, harassed, french, shipping, beginning, in, august, 1755, seizing, hundreds, of, ships, and, capturing, thousands, of, merchant, seamen, while, the, two, nations, were, nominally, at, peace, incensed, france, prepared, to, attack, hanover, whose, prince, elector, was, also, the, king, of, great, britain, and, menorca, britain, concluded, a, treaty, whereby, prussia, agreed, to, protect, hanover, in, response, france, concluded, an, alliance, with, its, long, time, enemy, austria, an, event, known, as, the, diplomatic, revolution, in, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, which, lasted, from, 1740, to, 1748, prussian, king, frederick, ii, known, as, frederick, the, great, seized, the, prosperous, province, of, silesia, from, austria, empress, maria, theresa, of, austria, had, signed, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, in, 1748, in, order, to, gain, time, to, rebuild, her, military, forces, and, forge, new, alliances, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, had, seen, the, belligerents, aligned, on, a, time, honoured, basis, france, s, traditional, enemies, great, britain, and, austria, had, coalesced, just, as, they, had, done, against, louis, xiv, prussia, the, leading, anti, austrian, state, in, germany, had, been, supported, by, france, neither, group, however, found, much, reason, to, be, satisfied, with, its, partnership, british, subsidies, to, austria, produced, nothing, of, much, help, to, the, british, while, the, british, military, effort, had, not, saved, silesia, for, austria, prussia, having, secured, silesia, came, to, terms, with, austria, in, disregard, of, french, interests, even, so, france, concluded, a, defensive, alliance, with, prussia, in, 1747, and, the, maintenance, of, the, anglo, austrian, alignment, after, 1748, was, deemed, essential, by, the, duke, of, newcastle, british, secretary, of, state, in, the, ministry, of, his, brother, henry, pelham, the, collapse, of, that, system, and, the, aligning, of, france, with, austria, and, of, great, britain, with, prussia, constituted, what, is, known, as, the, diplomatic, revolution, or, the, reversal, of, alliances, in, 1756, austria, was, making, military, preparations, for, war, with, prussia, and, pursuing, an, alliance, with, russia, for, this, purpose, on, 2, june, 1756, austria, and, russia, concluded, a, defensive, alliance, that, covered, their, own, territory, and, poland, against, attack, by, prussia, or, the, ottoman, empire, they, also, agreed, to, a, secret, clause, that, promised, the, restoration, of, silesia, and, the, countship, of, glatz, now, k, odzko, poland, to, austria, in, the, event, of, hostilities, with, prussia, their, real, desire, however, was, to, destroy, frederick, s, power, altogether, reducing, his, sway, to, his, electorate, of, brandenburg, and, giving, east, prussia, to, poland, an, exchange, that, would, be, accompanied, by, the, cession, of, the, polish, duchy, of, courland, to, russia, alexey, bestuzhev, ryumin, grand, chancellor, of, russia, under, empress, elizabeth, was, hostile, to, both, france, and, prussia, but, he, could, not, persuade, austrian, statesman, wenzel, anton, von, kaunitz, to, commit, to, offensive, designs, against, prussia, so, long, as, prussia, was, able, to, rely, on, french, support, the, hanoverian, king, george, ii, of, great, britain, was, passionately, devoted, to, his, family, s, continental, holdings, but, his, commitments, in, germany, were, counterbalanced, by, the, demands, of, the, british, colonies, overseas, if, war, against, france, for, colonial, expansion, was, to, be, resumed, then, hanover, had, to, be, secured, against, franco, prussian, attack, france, was, very, much, interested, in, colonial, expansion, and, was, willing, to, exploit, the, vulnerability, of, hanover, in, war, against, great, britain, but, it, had, no, desire, to, divert, forces, to, central, europe, for, prussia, s, interest, french, policy, was, moreover, complicated, by, the, existence, of, the, secret, du, roi, a, system, of, private, diplomacy, conducted, by, king, louis, xv, unbeknownst, to, his, foreign, minister, louis, had, established, a, network, of, agents, throughout, europe, with, the, goal, of, pursuing, personal, political, objectives, that, were, often, at, odds, with, france, s, publicly, stated, policies, louis, s, goals, for, le, secret, du, roi, included, the, polish, crown, for, his, kinsman, louis, fran, ois, de, bourbon, prince, of, conti, and, the, maintenance, of, poland, sweden, and, the, ottoman, empire, as, french, allies, in, opposition, to, russian, and, austrian, interests, frederick, saw, saxony, and, polish, west, prussia, as, potential, fields, for, expansion, but, could, not, expect, french, support, if, he, started, an, aggressive, war, for, them, if, he, joined, the, french, against, the, british, in, the, hope, of, annexing, hanover, he, might, fall, victim, to, an, austro, russian, attack, the, hereditary, elector, of, saxony, frederick, augustus, ii, was, also, elective, king, of, poland, as, augustus, iii, but, the, two, territories, were, physically, separated, by, brandenburg, and, silesia, neither, state, could, pose, as, a, great, power, saxony, was, merely, a, buffer, between, prussia, and, austrian, bohemia, whereas, poland, despite, its, union, with, the, ancient, lands, of, lithuania, was, prey, to, pro, french, and, pro, russian, factions, a, prussian, scheme, for, compensating, frederick, augustus, with, bohemia, in, exchange, for, saxony, obviously, presupposed, further, spoliation, of, austria, in, the, attempt, to, satisfy, austria, at, the, time, britain, gave, their, electoral, vote, in, hanover, for, the, candidacy, of, maria, theresa, s, son, joseph, ii, as, the, holy, roman, emperor, much, to, the, dismay, of, frederick, and, prussia, not, only, that, britain, would, soon, join, the, austro, russian, alliance, but, complications, arose, britain, s, basic, framework, for, the, alliance, itself, was, to, protect, hanover, s, interests, against, france, at, the, same, time, kaunitz, kept, approaching, the, french, in, the, hope, of, establishing, just, such, an, alliance, with, austria, not, only, that, france, had, no, intention, to, ally, with, russia, who, years, earlier, had, meddled, in, france, s, affairs, during, austria, s, succession, war, france, also, saw, the, dismemberment, of, prussia, as, threatening, to, the, stability, of, central, europe, years, later, kaunitz, kept, trying, to, establish, france, s, alliance, with, austria, he, tried, as, hard, as, he, could, to, avoid, austrian, entanglement, in, hanover, s, political, affairs, and, was, even, willing, to, trade, austrian, netherlands, for, france, s, aid, in, recapturing, silesia, frustrated, by, this, decision, and, by, the, dutch, republic, s, insistence, on, neutrality, britain, soon, turned, to, russia, on, 30, september, 1755, britain, pledged, financial, aid, to, russia, in, order, to, station, 50, 000, troops, on, the, livonian, lithuanian, border, so, they, could, defend, britain, s, interests, in, hanover, immediately, bestuzhev, assuming, the, preparation, was, directed, against, prussia, was, more, than, happy, to, obey, the, request, of, the, british, unbeknownst, to, the, other, powers, king, george, ii, also, made, overtures, to, the, prussian, king, frederick, who, fearing, the, austro, russian, intentions, was, also, desirous, of, a, rapprochement, with, britain, on, 16, january, 1756, the, convention, of, westminster, was, signed, whereby, britain, and, prussia, promised, to, aid, one, another, the, parties, hoped, to, achieve, lasting, peace, and, stability, in, europe, the, carefully, coded, word, in, the, agreement, proved, no, less, catalytic, for, the, other, european, powers, the, results, were, absolute, chaos, empress, elizabeth, of, russia, was, outraged, at, the, duplicity, of, britain, s, position, not, only, that, but, france, was, enraged, and, terrified, by, the, sudden, betrayal, of, its, only, ally, prussia, austria, particularly, kaunitz, used, this, situation, to, their, utmost, advantage, now, isolated, france, was, forced, to, accede, to, the, austro, russian, alliance, or, face, ruin, thereafter, on, 1, may, 1756, the, first, treaty, of, versailles, was, signed, in, which, both, nations, pledged, 24, 000, troops, to, defend, each, other, in, the, case, of, an, attack, this, diplomatic, revolution, proved, to, be, an, important, cause, of, the, war, although, both, treaties, were, ostensibly, defensive, in, nature, the, actions, of, both, coalitions, made, the, war, virtually, inevitable, european, warfare, in, the, early, modern, period, was, characterised, by, the, widespread, adoption, of, firearms, in, combination, with, more, traditional, bladed, weapons, eighteenth, century, european, armies, were, built, around, units, of, massed, infantry, armed, with, smoothbore, flintlock, muskets, and, bayonets, cavalrymen, were, equipped, with, sabres, and, pistols, or, carbines, light, cavalry, were, used, principally, for, reconnaissance, screening, and, tactical, communications, while, heavy, cavalry, were, used, as, tactical, reserves, and, deployed, for, shock, attacks, smoothbore, artillery, provided, fire, support, and, played, the, leading, role, in, siege, warfare, strategic, warfare, in, this, period, centred, around, control, of, key, fortifications, positioned, so, as, to, command, the, surrounding, regions, and, roads, with, lengthy, sieges, a, common, feature, of, armed, conflict, decisive, field, battles, were, relatively, rare, the, seven, years, war, like, most, european, wars, of, the, eighteenth, century, was, fought, as, a, so, called, cabinet, war, in, which, disciplined, regular, armies, were, equipped, and, supplied, by, the, state, to, conduct, warfare, on, behalf, of, the, sovereign, s, interests, occupied, enemy, territories, were, regularly, taxed, and, extorted, for, funds, but, large, scale, atrocities, against, civilian, populations, were, rare, compared, with, conflicts, in, the, previous, century, military, logistics, was, the, decisive, factor, in, many, wars, as, armies, had, grown, too, large, to, support, themselves, on, prolonged, campaigns, by, foraging, and, plunder, alone, military, supplies, were, stored, in, centralised, magazines, and, distributed, by, baggage, trains, that, were, highly, vulnerable, to, enemy, raids, armies, were, generally, unable, to, sustain, combat, operations, during, winter, and, normally, established, winter, quarters, in, the, cold, season, resuming, their, campaigns, with, the, return, of, spring, for, much, of, the, eighteenth, century, france, approached, its, wars, in, the, same, way, it, would, let, colonies, defend, themselves, or, would, offer, only, minimal, help, sending, them, limited, numbers, of, troops, or, inexperienced, soldiers, anticipating, that, fights, for, the, colonies, would, most, likely, be, lost, anyway, this, strategy, was, to, a, degree, forced, upon, france, geography, coupled, with, the, superiority, of, the, british, navy, made, it, difficult, for, the, french, navy, to, provide, significant, supplies, and, support, to, overseas, colonies, similarly, several, long, land, borders, made, an, effective, domestic, army, imperative, for, any, french, ruler, given, these, military, necessities, the, french, government, unsurprisingly, based, its, strategy, overwhelmingly, on, the, army, in, europe, it, would, keep, most, of, its, army, on, the, continent, hoping, for, victories, closer, to, home, the, plan, was, to, fight, to, the, end, of, hostilities, and, then, in, treaty, negotiations, to, trade, territorial, acquisitions, in, europe, to, regain, lost, overseas, possessions, as, had, happened, in, e, g, the, treaty, of, saint, germain, en, laye, and, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, this, approach, did, not, serve, france, well, in, the, war, as, the, colonies, were, indeed, lost, and, although, much, of, the, european, war, went, well, by, its, end, france, had, few, counterbalancing, european, successes, the, british, by, inclination, as, well, as, for, practical, reasons, had, tended, to, avoid, large, scale, commitments, of, troops, on, the, continent, they, sought, to, offset, the, disadvantage, of, this, in, europe, by, allying, themselves, with, one, or, more, continental, powers, whose, interests, were, antithetical, to, those, of, their, enemies, particularly, france, by, subsidising, the, armies, of, continental, allies, britain, could, turn, london, s, enormous, financial, power, to, military, advantage, in, the, seven, years, war, the, british, chose, as, their, principal, partner, the, most, brilliant, general, of, the, day, frederick, the, great, of, prussia, then, the, rising, power, in, central, europe, and, paid, frederick, substantial, subsidies, for, his, campaigns, this, was, accomplished, in, the, diplomatic, revolution, of, 1756, in, which, britain, ended, its, long, standing, alliance, with, austria, in, favour, of, prussia, leaving, austria, to, side, with, france, in, marked, contrast, to, france, britain, strove, to, prosecute, the, war, actively, overseas, taking, full, advantage, of, its, naval, power, the, british, pursued, a, dual, strategy, naval, blockade, and, bombardment, of, enemy, ports, and, rapid, movement, of, troops, by, sea, they, harassed, enemy, shipping, and, attacked, enemy, colonies, frequently, using, colonists, from, nearby, british, colonies, in, the, effort, the, russians, and, the, austrians, were, determined, to, reduce, the, power, of, prussia, the, new, threat, on, their, doorstep, and, austria, was, anxious, to, regain, silesia, lost, to, prussia, in, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, along, with, france, russia, and, austria, agreed, in, 1756, to, mutual, defence, and, an, attack, by, austria, and, russia, on, prussia, subsidized, by, france, westphalia, hesse, and, lower, saxony, electoral, saxony, brandenburg, silesia, east, prussia, pomerania, iberian, peninsula, naval, operations, william, pitt, the, elder, who, entered, the, cabinet, in, 1756, had, a, grand, vision, for, the, war, that, made, it, entirely, different, from, previous, wars, with, france, as, prime, minister, pitt, committed, britain, to, a, grand, strategy, of, seizing, the, entire, french, empire, especially, its, possessions, in, north, america, and, india, britain, s, main, weapon, was, the, royal, navy, which, could, control, the, seas, and, bring, as, many, invasion, troops, as, were, needed, he, also, planned, to, use, colonial, forces, from, the, thirteen, american, colonies, working, under, the, command, of, british, regulars, to, invade, new, france, in, order, to, tie, the, french, army, down, he, subsidized, his, european, allies, pitt, was, head, of, the, government, from, 1756, to, 1761, and, even, after, that, the, british, continued, his, strategy, it, proved, completely, successful, pitt, had, a, clear, appreciation, of, the, enormous, value, of, imperial, possessions, and, realized, the, vulnerability, of, the, french, empire, the, british, prime, minister, the, duke, of, newcastle, was, optimistic, that, the, new, series, of, alliances, could, prevent, war, from, breaking, out, in, europe, however, a, large, french, force, was, assembled, at, toulon, and, the, french, opened, the, campaign, against, the, british, with, an, attack, on, minorca, in, the, mediterranean, a, british, attempt, at, relief, was, foiled, at, the, battle, of, minorca, and, the, island, was, captured, on, 28, june, for, which, admiral, byng, was, court, martialed, and, executed, britain, formally, declared, war, on, france, on, 17, may, nearly, two, years, after, fighting, had, broken, out, in, the, ohio, country, frederick, ii, of, prussia, had, received, reports, of, the, clashes, in, north, america, and, had, formed, an, alliance, with, great, britain, on, 29, august, 1756, he, led, prussian, troops, across, the, border, of, saxony, one, of, the, small, german, states, in, league, with, austria, he, intended, this, as, a, bold, pre, emption, of, an, anticipated, austro, french, invasion, of, silesia, he, had, three, goals, in, his, new, war, on, austria, first, he, would, seize, saxony, and, eliminate, it, as, a, threat, to, prussia, then, use, the, saxon, army, and, treasury, to, aid, the, prussian, war, effort, his, second, goal, was, to, advance, into, bohemia, where, he, might, set, up, winter, quarters, at, austria, s, expense, thirdly, he, wanted, to, invade, moravia, from, silesia, seize, the, fortress, at, olm, tz, and, advance, on, vienna, to, force, an, end, to, the, war, accordingly, leaving, field, marshal, count, kurt, von, schwerin, in, silesia, with, 25, 000, soldiers, to, guard, against, incursions, from, moravia, and, hungary, and, leaving, field, marshal, hans, von, lehwaldt, in, east, prussia, to, guard, against, russian, invasion, from, the, east, frederick, set, off, with, his, army, for, saxony, the, prussian, army, marched, in, three, columns, on, the, right, was, a, column, of, about, 15, 000, men, under, the, command, of, prince, ferdinand, of, brunswick, on, the, left, was, a, column, of, 18, 000, men, under, the, command, of, the, duke, of, brunswick, bevern, in, the, centre, was, frederick, ii, himself, with, field, marshal, james, keith, commanding, a, corps, of, 30, 000, troops, ferdinand, of, brunswick, was, to, close, in, on, the, town, of, chemnitz, the, duke, of, brunswick, bevern, was, to, traverse, lusatia, to, close, in, on, bautzen, meanwhile, frederick, and, keith, would, make, for, dresden, the, saxon, and, austrian, armies, were, unprepared, and, their, forces, were, scattered, frederick, occupied, dresden, with, little, or, no, opposition, from, the, saxons, at, the, battle, of, lobositz, on, 1, october, 1756, frederick, stumbled, into, one, of, the, embarrassments, of, his, career, severely, underestimating, a, reformed, austrian, army, under, general, maximilian, ulysses, browne, he, found, himself, outmanoeuvred, and, outgunned, and, at, one, point, in, the, confusion, even, ordered, his, troops, to, fire, on, retreating, prussian, cavalry, frederick, actually, fled, the, field, of, battle, leaving, field, marshall, keith, in, command, browne, however, also, left, the, field, in, a, vain, attempt, to, meet, up, with, an, isolated, saxon, army, holed, up, in, the, fortress, at, pirna, as, the, prussians, technically, remained, in, control, of, the, field, of, battle, frederick, in, a, masterful, coverup, claimed, lobositz, as, a, prussian, victory, the, prussians, then, occupied, saxony, after, the, siege, of, pirna, the, saxon, army, surrendered, in, october, 1756, and, was, forcibly, incorporated, into, the, prussian, army, the, attack, on, neutral, saxony, caused, outrage, across, europe, and, led, to, the, strengthening, of, the, anti, prussian, coalition, the, austrians, had, succeeded, in, partially, occupying, silesia, and, more, importantly, denying, frederick, winter, quarters, in, bohemia, frederick, had, proven, to, be, overly, confident, to, the, point, of, arrogance, and, his, errors, were, very, costly, for, prussia, s, smaller, army, this, led, him, to, remark, that, he, did, not, fight, the, same, austrians, as, he, had, during, the, previous, war, britain, had, been, surprised, by, the, sudden, prussian, offensive, but, now, began, shipping, supplies, and, 670, 000, equivalent, to, 125, 9, million, in, 2023, to, its, new, ally, a, combined, force, of, allied, german, states, was, organised, by, the, british, to, protect, hanover, from, french, invasion, under, the, command, of, the, duke, of, cumberland, the, british, attempted, to, persuade, the, dutch, republic, to, join, the, alliance, but, the, request, was, rejected, as, the, dutch, wished, to, remain, fully, neutral, despite, the, huge, disparity, in, numbers, the, year, had, been, successful, for, the, prussian, led, forces, on, the, continent, in, contrast, to, the, british, campaigns, in, north, america, on, 18, april, 1757, frederick, ii, again, took, the, initiative, by, marching, into, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, hoping, to, inflict, a, decisive, defeat, on, austrian, forces, after, winning, the, bloody, battle, of, prague, on, 6, may, 1757, in, which, both, forces, suffered, major, casualties, the, prussians, forced, the, austrians, back, into, the, fortifications, of, prague, the, prussian, army, then, laid, siege, to, the, city, in, response, austrian, commander, leopold, von, daun, collected, a, force, of, 30, 000, men, to, come, to, the, relief, of, prague, following, the, battle, at, prague, frederick, took, 5, 000, troops, from, the, siege, at, prague, and, sent, them, to, reinforce, the, 19, 000, man, army, under, the, duke, of, brunswick, bevern, at, kol, n, in, bohemia, daun, arrived, too, late, to, participate, in, the, battle, of, prague, but, picked, up, 16, 000, men, who, had, escaped, from, the, battle, with, this, army, he, slowly, moved, to, relieve, prague, the, prussian, army, was, too, weak, to, simultaneously, besiege, prague, and, keep, daun, away, and, frederick, was, forced, to, attack, prepared, positions, the, resulting, battle, of, kol, n, was, a, sharp, defeat, for, frederick, his, first, his, losses, further, forced, him, to, lift, the, siege, and, withdraw, from, bohemia, altogether, later, that, summer, the, russians, under, field, marshal, apraksin, besieged, memel, with, 75, 000, troops, memel, had, one, of, the, strongest, fortresses, in, prussia, however, after, five, days, of, artillery, bombardment, the, russian, army, was, able, to, storm, it, the, russians, then, used, memel, as, a, base, to, invade, east, prussia, and, defeated, a, smaller, prussian, force, in, the, fiercely, contested, battle, of, gross, j, gersdorf, on, 30, august, 1757, in, the, words, of, the, american, historian, daniel, marston, gross, j, gersdorf, left, the, prussians, with, a, newfound, respect, for, the, fighting, capabilities, of, the, russians, that, was, reinforced, in, the, later, battles, of, zorndorf, and, kunersdorf, however, the, russians, were, not, yet, able, to, take, k, nigsberg, after, using, up, their, supplies, of, cannonballs, at, memel, and, gross, j, gersdorf, retreated, soon, afterwards, logistics, was, a, recurring, problem, for, the, russians, throughout, the, war, the, russians, lacked, a, quartermaster, s, department, capable, of, keeping, armies, operating, in, central, europe, properly, supplied, over, the, primitive, mud, roads, of, eastern, europe, the, tendency, of, russian, armies, to, break, off, operations, after, fighting, a, major, battle, even, when, they, were, not, defeated, was, less, about, their, casualties, and, more, about, their, supply, lines, after, expending, much, of, their, munitions, in, a, battle, russian, generals, did, not, wish, to, risk, another, battle, knowing, resupply, would, be, a, long, time, coming, this, long, standing, weakness, was, evident, in, the, russian, ottoman, war, of, 1735, 1739, where, russian, battle, victories, led, to, only, modest, war, gains, due, to, problems, supplying, their, armies, the, russian, quartermasters, department, had, not, improved, so, the, same, problems, reoccurred, in, prussia, still, the, imperial, russian, army, was, a, new, threat, to, prussia, not, only, was, frederick, forced, to, break, off, his, invasion, of, bohemia, he, was, also, now, forced, to, withdraw, further, into, prussian, controlled, territory, his, defeats, on, the, battlefield, brought, still, more, opportunistic, nations, into, the, war, sweden, declared, war, on, prussia, and, invaded, pomerania, with, 17, 000, men, sweden, felt, this, small, army, was, all, that, was, needed, to, occupy, pomerania, and, felt, the, swedish, army, would, not, need, to, engage, with, the, prussians, because, the, prussians, were, occupied, on, so, many, other, fronts, this, problem, was, compounded, when, the, main, hanoverian, army, under, cumberland, which, include, hesse, kassel, and, brunswick, troops, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, hastenbeck, and, forced, to, surrender, entirely, at, the, convention, of, klosterzeven, following, a, french, invasion, of, hanover, the, convention, removed, hanover, from, the, war, leaving, the, western, approach, to, prussian, territory, extremely, vulnerable, frederick, sent, urgent, requests, to, britain, for, more, substantial, assistance, as, he, was, now, without, any, outside, military, support, for, his, forces, in, germany, things, were, looking, grim, for, prussia, now, with, the, austrians, mobilising, to, attack, prussian, controlled, soil, and, a, combined, french, and, reichsarmee, force, under, prince, soubise, approaching, from, the, west, the, reichsarmee, was, a, collection, of, armies, from, the, smaller, german, states, that, had, banded, together, to, heed, the, appeal, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, franz, i, of, austria, against, frederick, however, in, november, and, december, 1757, the, whole, situation, in, germany, was, reversed, first, frederick, devastated, soubise, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, rossbach, on, 5, november, 1757, and, then, routed, a, vastly, superior, austrian, force, at, the, battle, of, leuthen, on, 5, december, 1757, rossbach, was, the, only, battle, between, the, french, and, the, prussians, during, the, entire, war, at, rossbach, the, prussians, lost, about, 548, men, killed, while, the, franco, reichsarmee, force, under, soubise, lost, about, 10, 000, killed, frederick, always, called, leuthen, his, greatest, victory, an, assessment, shared, by, many, at, the, time, as, the, austrian, army, was, considered, to, be, a, highly, professional, force, with, these, victories, frederick, once, again, established, himself, as, europe, s, premier, general, and, his, men, as, europe, s, most, accomplished, soldiers, however, frederick, missed, an, opportunity, to, completely, destroy, the, austrian, army, at, leuthen, although, depleted, it, escaped, back, into, bohemia, he, hoped, the, two, smashing, victories, would, bring, maria, theresa, to, the, peace, table, but, she, was, determined, not, to, negotiate, until, she, had, re, taken, silesia, maria, theresa, also, improved, the, austrians, command, after, leuthen, by, replacing, her, incompetent, brother, in, law, charles, of, lorraine, with, daun, who, was, now, a, field, marshal, calculating, that, no, further, russian, advance, was, likely, until, 1758, frederick, moved, the, bulk, of, his, eastern, forces, to, pomerania, under, the, command, of, marshal, lehwaldt, where, they, were, to, repel, the, swedish, invasion, in, short, order, the, prussian, army, drove, the, swedes, back, occupied, most, of, swedish, pomerania, and, blockaded, its, capital, stralsund, george, ii, of, great, britain, on, the, advice, of, his, british, ministers, after, the, battle, of, rossbach, revoked, the, convention, of, klosterzeven, and, hanover, reentered, the, war, over, the, winter, the, new, commander, of, the, hanoverian, forces, duke, ferdinand, of, brunswick, until, immediately, before, a, commander, in, the, prussian, army, regrouped, his, army, and, launched, a, series, of, offensives, that, drove, the, french, back, across, the, river, rhine, ferdinand, s, forces, kept, prussia, s, western, flank, secure, for, the, rest, of, the, war, the, british, had, suffered, further, defeats, in, north, america, particularly, at, fort, william, henry, at, home, however, stability, had, been, established, since, 1756, successive, governments, led, by, newcastle, and, pitt, had, fallen, in, august, 1757, the, two, men, agreed, to, a, political, partnership, and, formed, a, coalition, government, that, gave, new, firmer, direction, to, the, war, effort, the, new, strategy, emphasised, both, newcastle, s, commitment, to, british, involvement, on, the, continent, particularly, in, defence, of, its, german, possessions, and, pitt, s, determination, to, use, naval, power, to, seize, french, colonies, around, the, globe, this, dual, strategy, would, dominate, british, policy, for, the, next, five, years, between, 10, and, 17, october, 1757, a, hungarian, general, count, andr, s, hadik, serving, in, the, austrian, army, executed, what, may, be, the, most, famous, hussar, action, in, history, when, the, prussian, king, frederick, was, marching, south, with, his, powerful, armies, the, hungarian, general, unexpectedly, swung, his, force, of, 5, 000, mostly, hussars, around, the, prussians, and, occupied, part, of, their, capital, berlin, for, one, night, the, city, was, spared, for, a, negotiated, ransom, of, 200, 000, thalers, when, frederick, heard, about, this, humiliating, occupation, he, immediately, sent, a, larger, force, to, free, the, city, hadik, however, left, the, city, with, his, hussars, and, safely, reached, the, austrian, lines, subsequently, hadik, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, marshal, in, the, austrian, army, in, early, 1758, frederick, launched, an, invasion, of, moravia, and, laid, siege, to, olm, tz, now, olomouc, czech, republic, following, an, austrian, victory, at, the, battle, of, domstadtl, that, wiped, out, a, supply, convoy, destined, for, olm, tz, frederick, broke, off, the, siege, and, withdrew, from, moravia, it, marked, the, end, of, his, final, attempt, to, launch, a, major, invasion, of, austrian, territory, in, january, 1758, the, russians, invaded, east, prussia, where, the, province, almost, denuded, of, troops, put, up, little, opposition, east, prussia, had, been, occupied, by, russian, forces, over, the, winter, and, would, remain, under, their, control, until, 1762, although, it, was, far, less, strategically, valuable, to, prussia, than, brandenburg, or, silesia, in, any, case, frederick, did, not, see, the, russians, as, an, immediate, threat, and, instead, entertained, hopes, of, first, fighting, a, decisive, battle, against, austria, that, would, knock, them, out, of, the, war, in, april, 1758, the, british, concluded, the, anglo, prussian, convention, with, frederick, in, which, they, committed, to, pay, him, an, annual, subsidy, of, 670, 000, britain, also, dispatched, 9, 000, troops, to, reinforce, ferdinand, s, hanoverian, army, the, first, british, troop, commitment, on, the, continent, and, a, reversal, in, the, policy, of, pitt, ferdinand, s, hanoverian, army, supplemented, by, some, prussian, troops, had, succeeded, in, driving, the, french, from, hanover, and, westphalia, and, re, captured, the, port, of, emden, in, march, 1758, before, crossing, the, rhine, with, his, own, forces, which, caused, alarm, in, france, despite, ferdinand, s, victory, over, the, french, at, the, battle, of, krefeld, and, the, brief, occupation, of, d, sseldorf, he, was, compelled, by, the, successful, manoeuvering, of, larger, french, forces, to, withdraw, across, the, rhine, by, this, point, frederick, was, increasingly, concerned, by, the, russian, advance, from, the, east, and, marched, to, counter, it, just, east, of, the, oder, in, brandenburg, neumark, at, the, battle, of, zorndorf, now, sarbinowo, poland, a, prussian, army, of, 35, 000, men, under, frederick, on, 25, august, 1758, fought, a, russian, army, of, 43, 000, commanded, by, count, william, fermor, both, sides, suffered, heavy, casualties, the, prussians, 12, 800, the, russians, 18, 000, but, the, russians, withdrew, and, frederick, claimed, victory, the, american, historian, daniel, marston, described, zorndorf, as, a, draw, as, both, sides, were, too, exhausted, and, had, taken, such, losses, that, neither, wished, to, fight, another, battle, with, the, other, in, the, undecided, battle, of, tornow, on, 25, september, a, swedish, army, repulsed, six, assaults, by, a, prussian, army, but, did, not, push, on, berlin, following, the, battle, of, fehrbellin, the, war, was, continuing, indecisively, when, on, 14, october, marshal, daun, s, austrians, surprised, the, main, prussian, army, at, the, battle, of, hochkirch, in, saxony, frederick, lost, much, of, his, artillery, but, retreated, in, good, order, helped, by, dense, woods, the, austrians, had, ultimately, made, little, progress, in, the, campaign, in, saxony, despite, hochkirch, and, had, failed, to, achieve, a, decisive, breakthrough, after, a, thwarted, attempt, to, take, dresden, daun, s, troops, were, forced, to, withdraw, to, austrian, territory, for, the, winter, so, that, saxony, remained, under, prussian, occupation, at, the, same, time, the, russians, failed, in, an, attempt, to, take, kolberg, in, pomerania, now, ko, obrzeg, poland, from, the, prussians, in, france, 1758, had, been, disappointing, and, in, the, wake, of, this, a, new, chief, minister, the, duc, de, choiseul, was, appointed, choiseul, planned, to, end, the, war, in, 1759, by, making, strong, attacks, on, britain, and, hanover, prussia, suffered, several, defeats, in, 1759, at, the, battle, of, kay, or, paltzig, the, russian, count, saltykov, with, 40, 000, russians, defeated, 26, 000, prussians, commanded, by, general, carl, heinrich, von, wedel, though, the, hanoverians, defeated, an, army, of, 60, 000, french, at, minden, austrian, general, daun, forced, the, surrender, of, an, entire, prussian, corps, of, 13, 000, in, the, battle, of, maxen, frederick, himself, lost, half, his, army, in, the, battle, of, kunersdorf, now, kunowice, poland, the, worst, defeat, in, his, military, career, and, one, that, drove, him, to, the, brink, of, abdication, and, thoughts, of, suicide, the, disaster, resulted, partly, from, his, misjudgment, of, the, russians, who, had, already, demonstrated, their, strength, at, zorndorf, and, at, gross, j, gersdorf, now, motornoye, russia, and, partly, from, good, cooperation, between, the, russian, and, austrian, forces, however, disagreements, with, the, austrians, over, logistics, and, supplies, resulted, in, the, russians, withdrawing, east, yet, again, after, kunersdorf, ultimately, enabling, frederick, to, re, group, his, shattered, forces, the, french, planned, to, invade, the, british, isles, during, 1759, by, accumulating, troops, near, the, mouth, of, the, loire, and, concentrating, their, brest, and, toulon, fleets, however, two, sea, defeats, prevented, this, in, august, the, mediterranean, fleet, under, jean, fran, ois, de, la, clue, sabran, was, scattered, by, a, larger, british, fleet, under, edward, boscawen, at, the, battle, of, lagos, in, the, battle, of, quiberon, bay, on, 20, november, the, british, admiral, edward, hawke, with, 23, ships, of, the, line, caught, the, french, brest, fleet, with, 21, ships, of, the, line, under, marshal, de, conflans, and, sank, captured, or, forced, many, of, them, aground, putting, an, end, to, the, french, plans, the, year, 1760, brought, yet, more, prussian, disasters, the, general, fouqu, was, defeated, by, the, austrians, in, the, battle, of, landeshut, the, french, captured, marburg, in, hesse, and, the, swedes, part, of, pomerania, the, hanoverians, were, victorious, over, the, french, at, the, battle, of, warburg, their, continued, success, preventing, france, from, sending, troops, to, aid, the, austrians, against, prussia, in, the, east, despite, this, the, austrians, under, the, command, of, general, laudon, captured, glatz, now, k, odzko, poland, in, silesia, in, the, battle, of, liegnitz, frederick, scored, a, strong, victory, despite, being, outnumbered, three, to, one, the, russians, under, general, saltykov, and, austrians, under, general, lacy, briefly, occupied, his, capital, berlin, in, october, but, could, not, hold, it, for, long, still, the, loss, of, berlin, to, the, russians, and, austrians, was, a, great, blow, to, frederick, s, prestige, as, many, pointed, out, that, the, prussians, had, no, hope, of, occupying, temporarily, or, otherwise, st, petersburg, or, vienna, in, november, 1760, frederick, was, once, more, victorious, defeating, the, able, daun, in, the, battle, of, torgau, but, he, suffered, very, heavy, casualties, and, the, austrians, retreated, in, good, order, meanwhile, after, the, battle, of, kunersdorf, the, russian, army, was, mostly, inactive, due, mostly, to, their, tenuous, supply, lines, russian, logistics, were, so, poor, that, in, october, 1759, an, agreement, was, signed, under, which, the, austrians, undertook, to, supply, the, russians, as, the, quartermaster, s, department, of, the, russian, army, was, badly, strained, by, the, demands, of, russian, armies, operating, so, far, from, home, as, it, was, the, requirement, that, the, austrian, quartermaster, s, department, supply, both, the, austrian, and, russian, armies, proved, beyond, its, capacity, and, in, practice, the, russians, received, little, in, the, way, of, supplies, from, the, austrians, at, liegnitz, now, legnica, poland, the, russians, arrived, too, late, to, participate, in, the, battle, they, made, two, attempts, to, storm, the, fortress, of, kolberg, but, neither, succeeded, the, tenacious, resistance, of, kolberg, allowed, frederick, to, focus, on, the, austrians, instead, of, having, to, split, his, forces, prussia, began, the, 1761, campaign, with, just, 100, 000, available, troops, many, of, them, new, recruits, and, its, situation, seemed, desperate, however, the, austrian, and, russian, forces, were, also, heavily, depleted, and, could, not, launch, a, major, offensive, in, february, 1761, duke, ferdinand, of, brunswick, surprised, french, troops, at, langensalza, and, then, advanced, to, besiege, cassel, in, march, he, was, forced, to, lift, the, siege, and, retreat, after, french, forces, regrouped, and, captured, several, thousand, of, his, men, at, the, battle, of, gr, nberg, at, the, battle, of, villinghausen, forces, under, ferdinand, defeated, a, 92, 000, man, french, army, on, the, eastern, front, progress, was, very, slow, the, russian, army, was, heavily, dependent, upon, its, main, magazines, in, poland, and, the, prussian, army, launched, several, successful, raids, against, them, one, of, them, led, by, general, platen, in, september, resulted, in, the, loss, of, 2, 000, russians, mostly, captured, and, the, destruction, of, 5, 000, wagons, deprived, of, men, the, prussians, had, to, resort, to, this, new, sort, of, warfare, raiding, to, delay, the, advance, of, their, enemies, frederick, s, army, though, depleted, was, left, unmolested, at, its, headquarters, in, brunzelwitz, as, both, the, austrians, and, the, russians, were, hesitant, to, attack, it, nonetheless, at, the, end, of, 1761, prussia, suffered, two, critical, setbacks, the, russians, under, zakhar, chernyshev, and, pyotr, rumyantsev, stormed, kolberg, in, pomerania, while, the, austrians, captured, schweidnitz, the, loss, of, kolberg, cost, prussia, its, last, port, on, the, baltic, sea, a, major, problem, for, the, russians, throughout, the, war, had, always, been, their, weak, logistics, which, prevented, their, generals, from, following, up, their, victories, and, now, with, the, fall, of, kolberg, the, russians, could, at, long, last, supply, their, armies, in, central, europe, via, the, sea, the, fact, that, the, russians, could, now, supply, their, armies, over, the, sea, which, was, considerably, faster, and, safer, prussian, cavalry, could, not, intercept, russian, ships, in, the, baltic, than, over, the, land, threatened, to, swing, the, balance, of, power, decisively, against, prussia, as, frederick, could, not, spare, any, troops, to, protect, his, capital, in, britain, it, was, speculated, that, a, total, prussian, collapse, was, now, imminent, britain, now, threatened, to, withdraw, its, subsidies, if, frederick, did, not, consider, offering, concessions, to, secure, peace, as, the, prussian, armies, had, dwindled, to, just, 60, 000, men, and, with, berlin, itself, about, to, come, under, siege, the, survival, of, both, prussia, and, its, king, was, severely, threatened, then, on, 5, january, 1762, the, russian, empress, elizabeth, died, her, prussophile, successor, peter, iii, at, once, ended, the, russian, occupation, of, east, prussia, and, pomerania, see, the, treaty, of, saint, petersburg, and, mediated, frederick, s, truce, with, sweden, he, also, placed, a, corps, of, his, own, troops, under, frederick, s, command, frederick, was, then, able, to, muster, a, larger, army, of, 120, 000, men, and, concentrate, it, against, austria, he, drove, them, from, much, of, silesia, after, recapturing, schweidnitz, while, his, brother, henry, won, a, victory, in, saxony, in, the, battle, of, freiberg, 29, october, 1762, at, the, same, time, his, brunswick, allies, captured, the, key, town, of, g, ttingen, and, compounded, this, by, taking, cassel, two, new, countries, entered, the, war, in, 1762, britain, declared, war, against, spain, on, 4, january, 1762, spain, reacted, by, issuing, its, own, declaration, of, war, against, britain, on, 18, january, portugal, followed, by, joining, the, war, on, britain, s, side, spain, aided, by, the, french, launched, an, invasion, of, portugal, and, succeeded, in, capturing, almeida, the, arrival, of, british, reinforcements, stalled, a, further, spanish, advance, and, in, the, battle, of, valencia, de, alc, ntara, british, portuguese, forces, overran, a, major, spanish, supply, base, the, invaders, were, stopped, on, the, heights, in, front, of, abrantes, called, the, pass, to, lisbon, where, the, anglo, portuguese, were, entrenched, eventually, the, anglo, portuguese, army, aided, by, guerrillas, and, practising, a, scorched, earth, strategy, chased, the, greatly, reduced, franco, spanish, army, back, to, spain, recovering, almost, all, the, lost, towns, among, them, the, spanish, headquarters, in, castelo, branco, full, of, wounded, and, sick, that, had, been, left, behind, meanwhile, the, long, british, naval, blockade, of, french, ports, had, sapped, the, morale, of, the, french, populace, morale, declined, further, when, news, of, defeat, in, the, battle, of, signal, hill, in, newfoundland, reached, paris, after, russia, s, about, face, sweden, s, withdrawal, and, prussia, s, two, victories, against, austria, louis, xv, became, convinced, that, austria, would, be, unable, to, re, conquer, silesia, the, condition, for, which, france, would, receive, the, austrian, netherlands, without, financial, and, material, subsidies, which, louis, was, no, longer, willing, to, provide, he, therefore, made, peace, with, frederick, and, evacuated, prussia, s, rhineland, territories, ending, france, s, involvement, in, the, war, in, germany, by, 1763, the, war, in, central, europe, was, essentially, a, stalemate, between, prussia, and, austria, prussia, had, retaken, nearly, all, of, silesia, from, the, austrians, after, frederick, s, narrow, victory, over, daun, at, the, battle, of, burkersdorf, after, his, brother, henry, s, 1762, victory, at, the, battle, of, freiberg, frederick, held, most, of, saxony, but, not, its, capital, dresden, his, financial, situation, was, not, dire, but, his, kingdom, was, devastated, and, his, army, severely, weakened, his, manpower, had, dramatically, decreased, and, he, had, lost, so, many, effective, officers, and, generals, that, an, offensive, against, dresden, seemed, impossible, british, subsidies, had, been, stopped, by, the, new, prime, minister, john, stuart, lord, bute, and, the, russian, emperor, had, been, overthrown, by, his, wife, catherine, who, ended, russia, s, alliance, with, prussia, and, withdrew, from, the, war, austria, however, like, most, participants, was, facing, a, severe, financial, crisis, and, had, to, decrease, the, size, of, its, army, which, greatly, affected, its, offensive, power, indeed, after, having, effectively, sustained, a, long, war, its, administration, was, in, disarray, by, that, time, it, still, held, dresden, the, southeastern, parts, of, saxony, and, the, county, of, glatz, in, southern, silesia, but, the, prospect, of, victory, was, dim, without, russian, support, and, maria, theresa, had, largely, given, up, her, hopes, of, re, conquering, silesia, her, chancellor, husband, and, eldest, son, were, all, urging, her, to, make, peace, while, daun, was, hesitant, to, attack, frederick, in, 1763, a, peace, settlement, was, reached, at, the, treaty, of, hubertusburg, in, which, glatz, was, returned, to, prussia, in, exchange, for, the, prussian, evacuation, of, saxony, this, ended, the, war, in, central, europe, the, stalemate, had, really, been, reached, by, 1759, 1760, and, prussia, and, austria, were, nearly, out, of, money, the, materials, of, both, sides, had, been, largely, consumed, frederick, was, no, longer, receiving, subsidies, from, britain, the, golden, cavalry, of, st, george, had, produced, nearly, 13, million, dollars, equivalent, he, had, melted, and, coined, most, of, the, church, silver, had, ransacked, the, palaces, of, his, kingdom, and, coined, that, silver, and, reduced, his, purchasing, power, by, mixing, it, with, copper, his, banks, capital, was, exhausted, and, he, had, pawned, nearly, everything, of, value, from, his, own, estate, while, frederick, still, had, a, significant, amount, of, money, left, from, the, prior, british, subsidies, he, hoped, to, use, it, to, restore, his, kingdom, s, prosperity, in, peacetime, in, any, case, prussia, s, population, was, so, depleted, that, he, could, not, sustain, another, long, campaign, similarly, maria, theresa, had, reached, the, limit, of, her, resources, she, had, pawned, her, jewels, in, 1758, in, 1760, she, approved, a, public, subscription, for, support, and, urged, her, public, to, bring, their, silver, to, the, mint, french, subsidies, were, no, longer, provided, although, she, had, many, young, men, still, to, draft, she, could, not, conscript, them, and, did, not, dare, to, resort, to, impressment, as, frederick, had, done, she, had, even, dismissed, some, men, because, it, was, too, expensive, to, feed, them, great, britain, planned, a, descent, an, amphibious, demonstration, or, raid, on, rochefort, a, joint, operation, to, overrun, the, town, and, burn, shipping, in, the, charente, the, expedition, set, out, on, 8, september, 1757, sir, john, mordaunt, commanding, the, troops, and, sir, edward, hawke, the, fleet, on, 23, september, the, isle, d, aix, was, taken, but, military, staff, dithered, and, lost, so, much, time, that, rochefort, became, unassailable, the, expedition, abandoned, the, isle, d, aix, returning, to, great, britain, on, 1, october, despite, the, debatable, strategic, success, and, the, operational, failure, of, the, descent, on, rochefort, william, pitt, who, saw, purpose, in, this, type, of, asymmetric, enterprise, prepared, to, continue, such, operations, an, army, was, assembled, under, the, command, of, charles, spencer, he, was, aided, by, george, germain, the, naval, squadron, and, transports, for, the, expedition, were, commanded, by, richard, howe, the, army, landed, on, 5, june, 1758, at, cancale, bay, proceeded, to, st, malo, and, finding, that, it, would, take, prolonged, siege, to, capture, it, instead, attacked, the, nearby, port, of, st, servan, it, burned, shipping, in, the, harbour, roughly, 80, french, privateers, and, merchantmen, as, well, as, four, warships, which, were, under, construction, the, force, then, re, embarked, under, threat, of, the, arrival, of, french, relief, forces, an, attack, on, havre, de, grace, was, called, off, and, the, fleet, sailed, on, to, cherbourg, the, weather, being, bad, and, provisions, low, that, too, was, abandoned, and, the, expedition, returned, having, damaged, french, privateering, and, provided, further, strategic, demonstration, against, the, french, coast, pitt, now, prepared, to, send, troops, into, germany, and, both, marlborough, and, sackville, disgusted, by, what, they, perceived, as, the, futility, of, the, descents, obtained, commissions, in, that, army, the, elderly, general, bligh, was, appointed, to, command, a, new, descent, escorted, by, howe, the, campaign, began, propitiously, with, the, raid, on, cherbourg, covered, by, naval, bombardment, the, army, drove, off, the, french, force, detailed, to, oppose, their, landing, captured, cherbourg, and, destroyed, its, fortifications, docks, and, shipping, the, troops, were, reembarked, and, moved, to, the, bay, of, st, lunaire, in, brittany, where, on, 3, september, they, were, landed, to, operate, against, st, malo, however, this, action, proved, impractical, worsening, weather, forced, the, two, armies, to, separate, the, ships, sailed, for, the, safer, anchorage, of, st, cast, while, the, army, proceeded, overland, the, tardiness, of, bligh, in, moving, his, forces, allowed, a, french, force, of, 10, 000, from, brest, to, catch, up, with, him, and, open, fire, on,

algonquin, tribes, living, north, of, the, great, lakes, and, along, the, st, lawrence, river, were, not, directly, concerned, with, the, fate, of, the, ohio, river, valley, tribes, they, had, been, victims, of, the, iroquois, confederation, which, included, the, seneca, mohawk, oneida, onondaga, cayuga, and, tuscarora, tribes, of, central, new, york, the, iroquois, had, encroached, on,

captured, fort, oswego, and, fort, william, henry, from, the, british, the, latter, victory, was, marred, when, france, s, native, allies, broke, the, terms, of, capitulation, and, attacked, the,

the, process, of, deporting, the, acadian, population, with, a, wave, of, major, operations, against, le, saint, jean, present, day, prince, edward, island, and, the, st, john, river, and, the, petitcodiac, river, valleys, the, celebration, of, these, successes, was, dampened, by, their, embarrassing, defeat, in, the, battle, of, carillon, ticonderoga, in, which, 4, 000, french, troops, repulsed, 16, 000, british, when, the, british, led, by, generals, james, abercrombie, and, george, howe, attacked, they, believed, that, the, french, led, by, lieutenant, general, louis, joseph, de, montcalm, were, defended, only, by, a, small, abatis, which, could, be, taken, easily, given, the, british, force, s, significant, numerical, advantage, the, british, offensive, which, was, supposed, to, advance, in, tight, columns, and, overwhelm, the, french, defenders, fell, into, confusion, and, scattered, leaving, large, spaces, in, their, ranks, when, fran, ois, gaston, de, l, vis, sent, 1, 000, soldiers, to, reinforce, montcalm, s, struggling, troops, the, british, were, pinned, down, in, the, brush, by, intense, french, musket, fire, and, they, were, forced, to, retreat, all, of, britain, s, campaigns, against, new, france, succeeded, in, 1759, part, of, what, became, known, as, an, annus, mirabilis, starting, in, june, 1759, the, british, under, james, wolfe, and, james, murray, set, up, camp, on, the, le, d, orl, ans, across, the, st, lawrence, river, from, quebec, enabling, them, to, commence, the, 3, month, siege, that, ensued, the, french, under, the, marquis, de, montcalm, anticipated, a, british, assault, to, the, east, of, quebec, so, he, ordered, his, soldiers, to, fortify, the, region, of, beauport, in, july, 1759, fort, niagara, and, fort, carillon, fell, to, sizable, british, forces, cutting, off, french, frontier, forts, further, west, on, 31, july, the, british, attacked, with, 4, 000, soldiers, but, the, french, positioned, high, up, on, the, cliffs, overlooking, the, montmorency, falls, forced, the, british, forces, to, withdraw, to, the, le, d, orleans, while, wolfe, and, murray, planned, a, second, offensive, british, rangers, raided, french, settlements, along, the, st, lawrence, destroying, food, supplies, ammunition, and, other, goods, in, an, attempt, to, vanquish, the, french, through, starvation, on, 13, september, 1759, general, james, wolfe, led, 5, 000, troops, up, a, goat, path, to, the, plains, of, abraham, 1, mile, west, of, quebec, city, he, had, positioned, his, army, between, montcalm, s, forces, an, hour, s, march, to, the, east, and, louis, antoine, de, bougainville, s, regiments, to, the, west, which, could, be, mobilised, within, 3, hours, instead, of, waiting, for, a, coordinated, attack, with, bougainville, montcalm, attacked, immediately, when, his, 3, 500, troops, advanced, their, lines, became, scattered, in, a, disorderly, formation, many, french, soldiers, fired, before, they, were, within, range, of, striking, the, british, wolfe, organised, his, troops, in, two, lines, stretching, 1, mile, across, the, plains, of, abraham, they, were, ordered, to, load, their, brown, bess, muskets, with, two, bullets, to, obtain, maximum, power, and, hold, their, fire, until, the, french, soldiers, came, within, 40, paces, of, the, british, ranks, once, the, british, had, montcalm, s, army, in, firing, range, their, volley, was, powerful, and, nearly, all, bullets, hit, their, targets, devastating, the, french, ranks, the, french, fled, the, plains, of, abraham, in, a, state, of, utter, confusion, while, they, were, pursued, by, members, of, the, scottish, fraser, regiment, and, other, british, forces, despite, being, cut, down, by, musket, fire, from, the, canadians, and, their, indigenous, allies, the, british, vastly, outnumbered, these, opponents, and, won, the, battle, of, the, plains, of, abraham, general, wolfe, was, mortally, wounded, in, the, chest, early, in, the, battle, so, the, command, fell, to, james, murray, who, would, become, the, lieutenant, governor, of, quebec, after, the, war, the, marquis, de, montcalm, was, also, severely, wounded, later, in, the, battle, and, died, the, following, day, the, french, abandoned, the, city, and, french, canadians, led, by, the, chevalier, de, levis, staged, a, counteroffensive, on, the, plains, of, abraham, in, the, spring, of, 1760, with, initial, success, at, the, battle, of, sainte, foy, during, the, subsequent, siege, of, quebec, however, l, vis, was, unable, to, retake, the, city, largely, because, of, british, naval, superiority, following, the, battle, of, neuville, and, the, battle, of, restigouche, which, allowed, the, british, to, be, resupplied, but, not, the, french, the, french, forces, retreated, to, montreal, in, the, summer, of, 1760, and, after, a, two, month, campaign, by, overwhelming, british, forces, they, surrendered, on, 8, september, essentially, ending, the, french, empire, in, north, america, as, the, seven, years, war, was, not, yet, over, in, europe, the, british, put, all, of, new, france, under, a, military, regime, while, awaiting, the, results, this, regime, would, last, from, 1760, to, 1763, seeing, french, and, indian, defeat, in, 1760, the, six, nations, of, the, iroquois, confederacy, resigned, from, the, war, and, negotiated, the, treaty, of,

well, as, populations, living, throughout, the, area, in, 1762, towards, the, end, of, the, war, french, forces, attacked, st, john, s, newfoundland, if, successful, the, expedition, would, have, strengthened, france, s, hand, at, the, negotiating, table, although, they, took, st, john, s, and, raided, nearby, settlements, the, french, forces, were, eventually, defeated, by, british, troops, at, the, battle, of, signal, hill, this, was, the, final, battle, of, the, war, in, north, america, and, it, forced, the, french, to, surrender, to, lieutenant, colonel, william, amherst, the,

valpara, so, were, also, made, ready, for, an, eventual, english, attack, the, war, contributed, also, to, a, decision, to, improve, communications, between, buenos, aires, and, lima, resulting, in, the, establishment, of, a, series, of, mountain, shelters, in, the, high, andes, called, casuchas, del, rey, in, india, the, outbreak, of, the, seven, years, war, in, europe, renewed, the, long, running, conflict, between, the, french, and, the, british, trading, companies, for, influence, on, the, subcontinent, the, french, allied, themselves, with, the, mughal, empire, to, resist, british, expansion, but, derived, little, benefit, from, this, the, war, began, in, southern, india, but, spread, into, bengal, where, british, forces, under, robert, clive, recaptured, calcutta, from, the, nawab, siraj, ud, daulah, a, french, ally, and, ousted, him, from, his, throne, at, the, battle, of, plassey, in, 1757, in, the, same, year, the, british, also, captured, chandernagar, the, french, settlement, in, bengal, in, the, south, although, the, french, captured, cuddalore, their, siege, of, madras, failed, while, the, british, commander, sir, eyre, coote, decisively, defeated, the,

the, urging, of, an, american, merchant, thomas, cumming, pitt, dispatched, an, expedition, to, take, the, french, settlement, at, saint, louis, senegal, the, british, captured, senegal, with, ease, in, may, 1758, and, brought, home, large, amounts, of, captured, goods, this, success, convinced, pitt, to, launch, two, further, expeditions, to, take, the, island, of, gor, e, and, the, french, trading, post, on, the, gambia, the, battles, in, west, africa, were, ultimately, a, series, of, british, expeditions, against, wealthy, french, colonies, the, british, and, french, had, been, competing, for, influence, in, the, gambia, region, following, the, acquisition, of, james, island, in, 1664, by, the, english, from, the, dutch, the, loss, of, these, valuable, colonies, to, the, british, further, weakened, the, french, economy, despite, being, one, of, the, major, european, powers, during, this, time, the, ottoman, empire, was, notably, neutral, during, the, seven, years, war, following, their, military, stalemate, with, the, russian, empire, and, their, subsequent, victory, over, the, holy, roman, empire, and, austria, to, an, extent, during, the, austro, russian, turkish, war, 1735, 1739, and, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, belgrade, the, ottoman, empire, enjoyed, a, generation, of, peace, due, to, austria, and, russia, contending, with, the, rise, of, prussia, in, eastern, europe, during, the, war, king, frederick, ii, of, prussia, better, known, to, history, as, frederick, the, great, had, made, diplomatic, overtures, with, the, ottoman, sultan, mustafa, iii, for, years, up, to, the, outbreak, of, war, to, bring, the, empire, into, the, war, on, the, side, of, prussia, great, britain, and, their, other, allies, but, he, was, unsuccessful, however, the, sultan, was, persuaded, by, his, court, not, to, join, the, war, primarily, by, his, grand, vizier, koca, rag, b, pasha, who, was, quoted, as, saying, our, state, looks, like, a, majestic, and, mighty, lion, from, afar, however, a, closer, look, at, this, lion, reveals, that, it, has, aged, its, teeth, have, fallen, out, its, claws, have, fallen, so, let, s, leave, this, old, lion, to, rest, for, a, while, therefore, the, ottoman, empire, avoided, the, major, wars, that, would, follow, including, the, seven, years, war, the, ottoman, empire, or, more, accurately, its, leaders, recognised, its, internal, problems, the, previous, wars, had, cost, the, empire, greatly, both, in, terms, of, resources, and, finance, they, were, facing, rebellions, from, nationalistic, uprisings, notably, from, the, beyliks, and, persia, had, been, reunited, under, karim, khan, zand, that, said, the, ottoman, empire, would, launch, an, abortive, invasion, of, hungary, with, 100, 000, troops, in, 1763, contributing, to, the, end, of, the, war, persia, ended, up, under, the, rule, of, the, zand, dynasty, during, the, period, of, the, seven, years, war, like, the, ottoman, empire, they, were, also, neutral, during, the, war, they, had, more, pressing, matters, to, attend, to, karim, khan, zand, was, busy, playing, politics, and, was, in, the, process, of, legitimising, his, claim, to, the, persian, throne, by, placing, a, puppet, king, on, the, throne, ismail, iii, the, grandson, of, the, last, safavid, king, in, 1757, however, by, 1760, he, had, managed, to, eliminate, all, other, potential, claimants, to, the, throne, as, well, as, ismail, iii, and, had, established, himself, as, the, head, of, his, own, dynasty, the, aforementioned, zand, dynasty, the, dutch, republic, had, played, a, central, role, in, the, wars, against, louis, xiv, s, france, in, the, late, 1600s, and, early, 1700s, and, doing, this, had, proved, to, be, very, expensive, this, motivated, the, dutch, to, try, to, stay, out, of, major, 18th, century, european, conflicts, like, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, and, war, of, the, austrian, succession, grand, pensionary, laurens, van, de, spiegel, in, 1782, blamed, the, earlier, generations, for, placing, too, heavy, a, burden, on, their, descendants, by, waging, wars, on, credit, every, new, war, is, a, step, closer, to, taking, away, from, the, descendants, the, means, of, defence, they, need, it, was, precisely, for, this, reason, that, pieter, steyn, grand, pensionary, of, holland, from, 1749, to, 1772, wanted, the, republic, to, align, its, foreign, policy, with, the, state, of, its, finances, specifically, this, meant, that, holland, should, do, everything, possible, to, ensure, that, the, republic, did, not, become, involved, in, the, franco, british, dispute, despite, animosity, towards, france, and, being, a, long, time, ally, of, britain, this, was, not, going, to, be, easy, because, london, was, exerting, great, pressure, on, the, states, general, to, make, troops, available, for, the, defence, of, great, britain, as, soon, as, hostilities, with, france, were, to, occur, and, as, the, daughter, of, george, ii, it, would, be, almost, impossible, for, princess, anne, regent, in, the, dutch, republic, for, william, v, of, orange, to, refuse, the, requested, help, however, the, wealthy, merchants, of, amsterdam, did, not, want, to, go, to, war, for, britain, s, interests, together, with, french, assurances, that, king, louis, xv, did, not, want, to, multiply, his, enemies, and, that, it, was, the, prussians, who, broke, the, peace, this, made, it, possible, for, steyn, to, declare, the, republic, neutral, despite, british, threats, the, detention, of, many, dutch, merchant, ships, by, the, british, and, various, incidents, as, when, dutch, soldiers, stationed, in, the, austrian, netherlands, fired, celebratory, gunshots, in, support, of, the, prussians, after, the, battle, of, breslau, the, dutch, republic, managed, to, preserve, its, neutrality, during, the, seven, years, war, it, owed, this, to, the, memory, of, what, it, had, been, and, what, it, could,

possessions, along, the, dutch, eastern, border, and, for, george, ii, the, dutch, seaports, provided, the, most, secure, link, with, hanover, for, their, part, the, british, were, concerned, that, their, supremacy, at, sea, would, be, jeopardised, if, the, republic, were, to, lend, its, cooperation, to, a, french, plan, for, joint, maritime, action, by, the, french, spanish, danish, and, dutch, fleets, in, addition, the, government, in, london, had, not, yet, given, up, hope, to, restore, the, disrupted, relationship, with, the, dutch, by, including, them, in, a, military, and, political, bloc, formed, by, britain, hanover, prussia, and, the, dutch, republic, when, the, states, of, holland, announced, in, the, states, general, on, 12, january, 1759, that, they, had, decided, to, equip, 25, warships, at, their, own, expense, if, need, be, and, princess, anna, also, died, that, same, evening, the, british, government, realised, that, it, should, not, let, things, get, out, of, hand, by, inflicting, too, much, damage, on, dutch, trade, it, resigned, itself, to, the, fact, that, the, republic, persisted, in, its, neutral, stance, unofficially, the, dutch, east, india, company, would, attempt, to, undermine, or, even, prevent, british, domination, in, india, during, the, third, carnatic, war, denmark, norway, was, another, neutral, nation, during, the, seven, years, war, although, it, could, be, argued, that, due, to, close, calls, it, was, a, belligerent, nation, it, was, very, nearly, dragged, into, the, war, on, the, side, of, france, due, to, the, actions, of, the, russian, empire, tsar, peter, iii, had, desired, on, reclaiming, his, title, of, duke, of, holstein, gottorp, whose, lands, were, being, overseen, by, the, current, king, of, denmark, norway, frederick, v, and, was, prepared, to, attack, denmark, norway, in, order, to, do, this, however, luckily, for, denmark, norway, the, russian, emperor, was, deposed, by, his, wife, catherine, ii, before, war, could, break, out, the, anglo, french, hostilities, were, ended, in, 1763, by, the, treaty, of, paris, which, involved, a, complex, series, of, land, exchanges, the, most, important, being, france, s, cession, to, spain, of, louisiana, and, to, great, britain, the, rest, of, new, france, britain, returned, to, france, the, islands, of, saint, pierre, and, miquelon, which, had, been, ceded, to, britain, in, 1714, under, the, treaty, of, utrecht, to, assist, with, french, fishing, rights, faced, with, the, choice, of, regaining, either, new, france, or, its, caribbean, island, colonies, of, guadeloupe, and, martinique, france, chose, the, latter, to, retain, these, lucrative, sources, of, sugar, writing, off, new, france, as, an, unproductive, costly, territory, france, also, returned, menorca, to, the, british, spain, lost, control, of, florida, to, great, britain, but, it, received, from, the, french, the, le, d, orl, ans, and, all, of, the, former, french, holdings, west, of, the, mississippi, river, the, exchanges, suited, the, british, as, well, as, their, own, west, indian, islands, already, supplied, ample, sugar, and, with, the, acquisition, of, new, france, and, florida, they, now, controlled, all, of, north, america, east, of, the, mississippi, in, india, the, british, retained, the, northern, circars, but, returned, all, the, french, trading, ports, the, treaty, however, required, that, the, fortifications, of, these, settlements, be, destroyed, and, never, rebuilt, while, only, minimal, garrisons, could, be, maintained, there, thus, rendering, them, worthless, as, military, bases, combined, with, the, loss, of, france, s, ally, in, bengal, and, the, defection, of, hyderabad, to, the, british, as, a, result, of, the, war, this, effectively, brought, french, power, in, india, to, an, end, making, way, for, british, hegemony, and, eventual, control, of, the, subcontinent, france, s, navy, was, crippled, by, the, war, only, after, an, ambitious, rebuilding, program, in, combination, with, spain, was, france, again, able, to, challenge, britain, s, command, of, the, sea, bute, s, settlement, with, france, was, mild, compared, with, what, pitt, s, would, have, been, he, had, hoped, for, a, lasting, peace, with, france, and, he, was, afraid, that, if, he, took, too, much, the, whole, of, europe, would, unite, in, envious, hostility, against, great, britain, choiseul, however, had, no, intention, of, making, a, permanent, peace, and, when, france, went, to, war, with, great, britain, during, the, american, revolution, the, british, found, no, support, among, the, european, powers, france, s, defeat, caused, the, french, to, embark, upon, major, military, reforms, with, particular, attention, being, paid, to, the, artillery, the, origins, of, the, famed, french, artillery, that, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, wars, of, the, french, revolution, and, beyond, can, to, be, traced, to, military, reforms, that, started, in, 1763, the, treaty, of, hubertusburg, between, austria, prussia, and, saxony, was, signed, on, 15, february, 1763, at, a, hunting, lodge, between, dresden, and, leipzig, negotiations, had, started, there, on, 31, december, 1762, frederick, who, had, considered, ceding, east, prussia, to, russia, if, peter, iii, helped, him, secure, saxony, finally, insisted, on, excluding, russia, in, fact, no, longer, a, belligerent, from, the, negotiations, at, the, same, time, he, refused, to, evacuate, saxony, until, its, elector, had, renounced, any, claim, to, reparation, the, austrians, wanted, at, least, to, retain, glatz, which, they, had, in, fact, reconquered, but, frederick, would, not, allow, it, the, treaty, simply, restored, the, status, quo, of, 1748, with, silesia, and, glatz, reverting, to, frederick, and, saxony, to, its, own, elector, the, only, concession, that, prussia, made, to, austria, was, to, consent, to, the, election, of, archduke, joseph, as, holy, roman, emperor, saxony, emerged, from, the, war, weakened, and, bankrupt, despite, losing, no, territory, saxony, had, essentially, been, a, battleground, between, prussia, and, austria, throughout, the, conflict, with, many, of, its, towns, and, cities, including, the, capital, of, dresden, damaged, by, bombardment, and, looting, austria, was, not, able, to, retake, silesia, or, make, any, significant, territorial, gain, however, it, did, prevent, prussia, from, invading, parts, of, saxony, more, significantly, its, military, performance, proved, far, better, than, during, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, and, seemed, to, vindicate, maria, theresa, s, administrative, and, military, reforms, hence, austria, s, prestige, was, restored, in, great, part, and, the, empire, secured, its, position, as, a, major, player, in, the, european, system, also, by, promising, to, vote, for, joseph, ii, in, the, imperial, elections, frederick, ii, accepted, the, habsburg, preeminence, in, the, holy, roman, empire, the, survival, of, prussia, as, a, first, rate, power, and, the, enhanced, prestige, of, its, king, and, army, however, was, potentially, damaging, in, the, long, run, to, austria, s, influence, in, germany, not, only, that, austria, now, found, herself, estranged, with, the, new, developments, within, the, empire, itself, besides, the, rise, of, prussia, augustus, iii, although, ineffective, could, muster, an, army, not, only, from, saxony, but, also, poland, since, he, was, also, the, king, of, poland, as, well, as, elector, of, saxony, bavaria, s, growing, power, and, independence, was, also, apparent, as, it, asserted, more, control, on, the, deployment, of, its, army, and, managed, to, disengage, from, the, war, at, its, own, will, most, importantly, with, the, now, belligerent, hanover, united, personally, under, george, iii, of, great, britain, it, amassed, a, considerable, power, and, even, brought, britain, in, on, future, conflicts, this, power, dynamic, was, important, to, the, future, and, the, latter, conflicts, of, the, reich, the, war, also, proved, that, maria, theresa, s, reforms, were, still, insufficient, to, compete, with, prussia, unlike, its, enemy, the, austrians, were, almost, bankrupt, at, the, end, of, war, hence, she, dedicated, the, next, two, decades, to, the, consolidation, of, her, administration, prussia, emerged, from, the, war, as, a, great, power, whose, importance, could, no, longer, be, challenged, frederick, the, great, s, personal, reputation, was, enormously, enhanced, as, his, debt, to, fortune, russia, s, betrayal, after, elizabeth, s, death, and, to, british, financial, support, were, soon, forgotten, while, the, memory, of, his, energy, and, his, military, genius, was, strenuously, kept, alive, though, depicted, as, a, key, moment, in, prussia, s, rise, to, greatness, the, war, weakened, prussia, prussia, s, lands, and, population, were, devastated, though, frederick, s, extensive, agrarian, reforms, and, encouragement, of, immigration, soon, solved, both, these, problems, unfortunately, for, prussia, its, army, had, taken, heavy, losses, particularly, the, officer, corps, and, in, the, war, s, aftermath, frederick, could, not, afford, to, rebuild, the, prussian, army, to, what, it, was, before, the, war, in, the, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, the, prussians, fought, poorly, despite, being, led, by, frederick, in, person, during, the, war, with, france, in, 1792, 95, the, prussian, army, did, not, fare, well, against, revolutionary, france, and, in, 1806, the, prussians, suffered, a, complete, defeat, by, the, french, at, the, battle, of, jena, it, was, only, after, 1806, when, prussian, government, brought, in, reforms, to, recover, from, the, disaster, of, jena, that, prussia, s, rise, to, greatness, later, in, the, 19th, century, was, realized, however, in, the, aftermath, of, the, seven, years, war, various, nations, all, sent, officers, to, prussia, to, learn, the, secrets, of, prussia, s, military, power, prussia, become, one, of, the, most, imitated, powers, in, europe, russia, on, the, other, hand, made, one, great, invisible, gain, from, the, war, the, elimination, of, french, influence, in, poland, the, first, partition, of, poland, 1772, was, to, be, a, russo, prussian, transaction, with, austria, only, reluctantly, involved, and, with, france, completely, absent, though, the, war, had, ended, in, a, draw, the, performance, of, the, imperial, russian, army, against, prussia, had, improved, russia, s, reputation, as, a, factor, in, european, politics, as, many, had, not, expected, the, russians, to, hold, their, own, against, the, prussians, in, campaigns, fought, on, prussian, soil, the, american, historian, david, stone, observed, that, russian, soldiers, proved, capable, of, going, head, on, against, the, prussians, inflicting, and, taking, one, bloody, volley, after, another, without, flinching, and, though, the, quality, of, russian, generalship, was, quite, variable, the, russians, were, never, decisively, defeated, once, in, the, war, the, russians, defeated, the, prussians, several, times, in, the, war, but, the, russians, lacked, the, necessary, logistical, capability, to, follow, up, their, victories, with, lasting, gains, and, in, this, sense, the, salvation, of, the, house, of, hohenzollern, was, due, more, to, russian, weakness, with, respect, to, logistics, than, to, prussian, strength, on, the, battlefield, still, the, fact, that, the, russians, proved, capable, of, defeating, in, battle, the, army, of, a, first, rate, european, power, on, its, own, soil, despite, the, often, indifferent, quality, of, their, generals, improved, russia, s, standing, in, europe, a, lasting, legacy, of, the, war, was, that, it, awakened, the, russians, to, their, logistic, weaknesses, and, led, to, major, reforms, of, the, imperial, russian, army, s, quartermaster, department, the, supply, system, that, allowed, the, russians, to, advance, into, the, balkans, during, the, war, with, the, ottomans, in, 1787, 1792, marshal, alexander, suvorov, to, campaign, effectively, in, italy, and, switzerland, in, 1798, 1799, and, for, the, russians, to, fight, across, germany, and, france, in, 1813, 1814, to, take, paris, was, created, directly, in, response, to, the, logistic, problems, experienced, by, the, russians, in, the, seven, years, war, the, british, government, was, close, to, bankruptcy, and, britain, now, faced, the, delicate, task, of, pacifying, its, new, french, canadian, subjects, as, well, as, the, many, american, indian, tribes, who, had, supported, france, in, 1763, pontiac, s, war, broke, out, as, a, group, of, indian, tribes, in, the, great, lakes, region, and, the, northwest, the, modern, american, midwest, said, to, have, been, led, by, the, ottawa, chief, pontiac, whose, role, as, the, leader, of, the, confederation, seems, to, have, been, exaggerated, by, the, british, unhappy, with, the, eclipse, of, french, power, rebelled, against, british, rule, the, indians, had, long, established, congenial, and, friendly, relations, with, the, french, fur, traders, and, the, anglo, american, fur, traders, who, had, replaced, the, french, had, engaged, in, business, practices, that, enraged, the, indians, who, complained, about, being, cheated, when, they, sold, their, furs, moreover, the, indians, feared, that, with, the, coming, of, british, rule, might, lead, to, white, settlers, displacing, them, off, their, land, whereas, it, was, known, that, the, french, had, only, come, as, fur, traders, pontiac, s, war, was, a, major, conflict, in, which, the, british, temporarily, lost, control, of, the, great, lakes, northwest, regions, to, the, indians, by, the, middle, of, 1763, the, only, forts, the, british, held, in, the, region, were, fort, detroit, modern, detroit, michigan, fort, niagara, modern, youngstown, new, york, and, fort, pitt, modern, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, with, the, rest, all, being, lost, to, the, indians, it, was, only, with, the, british, victory, at, the, battle, of, bushy, run, that, prevented, a, complete, collapse, of, british, power, in, the, great, lakes, region, king, george, iii, s, proclamation, of, 1763, which, forbade, white, settlement, beyond, the, crest, of, the, appalachians, was, intended, to, appease, the, indians, but, led, to, considerable, outrage, in, the, thirteen, colonies, whose, inhabitants, were, eager, to, acquire, native, lands, the, quebec, act, of, 1774, similarly, intended, to, win, over, the, loyalty, of, french, canadians, also, spurred, resentment, among, american, colonists, the, act, protected, catholic, religion, and, french, language, which, enraged, the, americans, but, the, qu, b, cois, remained, loyal, to, the, british, crown, during, the, american, revolution, and, did, not, rebel, the, war, also, brought, to, an, end, the, old, system, of, alliances, in, europe, in, the, years, after, the, war, under, the, direction, of, john, montagu, lord, sandwich, the, british, attempted, to, re, establish, this, system, but, after, her, surprising, grand, success, against, a, coalition, of, great, powers, european, states, such, as, austria, the, dutch, republic, sweden, denmark, norway, the, ottoman, empire, and, russia, now, saw, britain, as, a, greater, threat, than, france, and, did, not, join, with, it, while, the, prussians, were, angered, by, what, they, considered, a, british, betrayal, in, 1762, consequently, when, the, american, revolutionary, war, turned, into, a, global, war, between, 1778, and, 1783, britain, found, itself, opposed, by, a, strong, coalition, of, european, powers, and, lacking, any, substantial, ally, it, would, require, a, greater, philosopher, and, historian, than, i, am, to, explain, the, causes, of, the, famous, seven, years, war, in, which, europe, was, engaged, and, indeed, its, origin, has, always, appeared, to, me, to, be, so, complicated, and, the, books, written, about, it, so, amazingly, hard, to, understand, that, i, have, seldom, been, much, wiser, at, the, end, of, a, chapter, than, at, the, beginning, and, so, shall, not, trouble, my, reader, with, any, personal, disquisitions, concerning, the, matter
