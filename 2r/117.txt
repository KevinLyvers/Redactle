west, and, southwest, of, modern, day, iran, stretching, from, the, lowlands, of, what, is, now, khuzestan, and, ilam, province, as, well, as, a, small, part, of, southern, iraq, the, modern, name, elam, stems, from, the, sumerian, transliteration, elam, a, along, with, the, later, akkadian, elamtu, and, the, elamite, haltamti, elamite, states, were, among, the, leading, political, forces, of, the, ancient, near, east, in, classical, literature, elam, was, also, known, as, susiana, us, s, u, i, n, uk, s, u, z, i, n, ancient, greek, sousi, n, a, name, derived, from, its, capital, susa, elam, was, part, of, the, early, urbanization, of, the, near, east, during, the, chalcolithic, period, copper, age, the, emergence, of, written, records, from, around, 3000, bc, also, parallels, sumerian, history, where, slightly, earlier, records, have, been, found, in, the, old, elamite, period, middle, bronze, age, elam, consisted, of, kingdoms, on, the, iranian, plateau, centered, in, anshan, and, from, the, mid, 2nd, millennium, bc, it, was, centered, in, susa, in, the, khuzestan, lowlands, its, culture, played, a, crucial, role, during, the, persian, achaemenid, dynasty, that, succeeded, elam, when, the, elamite, language, remained, among, those, in, official, use, elamite, is, generally, considered, a, language, isolate, unrelated, to, any, other, languages, in, accordance, with, geographical, and, archaeological, matches, some, historians, argue, that, the, elamites, comprise, a, large, portion, of, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, day, lurs, whose, language, luri, split, from, middle, persian, the, elamite, language, endonym, of, elam, as, a, country, appears, to, have, been, hatamti, in, linear, elamite, or, haltamti, cuneiform, elamite, halatamti, exonyms, included, the, sumerian, names, elam, ma, ki, and, elam, the, akkadian, elam, masculine, neuter, and, elam, tu, feminine, meant, resident, of, susiana, elamite, the, sumerian, term, elam, also, referred, to, the, highlands, in, prehistory, elam, was, centered, primarily, in, modern, khuzest, n, and, ilam, the, name, khuzest, n, is, derived, ultimately, from, old, persian, h, ja, meaning, susa, elam, this, became, middle, persian, h, z, susiana, and, in, modern, persian, xuz, compounded, with, the, toponymic, suffix, st, n, place, in, geographical, terms, susiana, basically, represents, the, iranian, province, of, khuzestan, around, the, river, karun, in, ancient, times, several, names, were, used, to, describe, this, area, the, ancient, geographer, ptolemy, was, the, earliest, to, call, the, area, susiana, referring, to, the, country, around, susa, another, ancient, geographer, strabo, viewed, elam, and, susiana, as, two, different, geographic, regions, he, referred, to, elam, land, of, the, elymaei, as, primarily, the, highland, area, of, khuzestan, disagreements, over, the, location, also, exist, in, the, jewish, historical, sources, says, daniel, t, potts, some, ancient, sources, draw, a, distinction, between, elam, as, the, highland, area, of, khuzestan, and, susiana, as, the, lowland, area, yet, in, other, ancient, sources, elam, and, susiana, seem, equivalent, the, uncertainty, in, this, area, extends, also, to, modern, scholarship, since, the, discovery, of, ancient, anshan, and, the, realization, of, its, great, importance, in, elamite, history, the, definitions, were, changed, again, some, modern, scholars, argued, that, the, center, of, elam, lay, at, anshan, and, in, the, highlands, around, it, and, not, at, susa, in, lowland, khuzistan, potts, disagrees, suggesting, that, the, term, elam, was, primarily, constructed, by, the, mesopotamians, to, describe, the, area, in, general, terms, without, referring, specifically, either, to, the, lowlanders, or, the, highlanders, elam, is, not, an, iranian, term, and, has, no, relationship, to, the, conception, which, the, peoples, of, highland, iran, had, of, themselves, they, were, anshanites, marhashians, shimashkians, zabshalians, sherihumians, awanites, etc, that, anshan, played, a, leading, role, in, the, political, affairs, of, the, various, highland, groups, inhabiting, southwestern, iran, is, clear, but, to, argue, that, anshan, is, coterminous, with, elam, is, to, misunderstand, the, artificiality, and, indeed, the, alienness, of, elam, as, a, construct, imposed, from, without, on, the, peoples, of, the, southwestern, highlands, of, the, zagros, mountain, range, the, coast, of, fars, and, the, alluvial, plain, drained, by, the, karun, karkheh, river, system, prehistorically, the, area, was, well, settled, during, the, ubaid, period, and, shared, many, aspects, of, ubaid, cultures, knowledge, of, elamite, history, remains, largely, fragmentary, reconstruction, being, based, on, mainly, mesopotamian, sumerian, akkadian, assyrian, and, babylonian, sources, the, history, of, elam, is, conventionally, divided, into, three, periods, spanning, more, than, two, millennia, the, period, before, the, first, elamite, period, is, known, as, the, proto, elamite, period, proto, elamite, civilization, grew, up, east, of, the, tigris, and, euphrates, alluvial, plains, it, was, a, combination, of, the, lowlands, and, the, immediate, highland, areas, to, the, north, and, east, at, least, three, proto, elamite, states, merged, to, form, elam, anshan, awan, and, shimashki, references, to, awan, are, generally, older, than, those, to, anshan, and, some, scholars, suggest, that, both, states, encompassed, the, same, territory, in, different, eras, see, hanson, encyclop, dia, iranica, to, this, core, shushiana, was, periodically, annexed, and, broken, off, in, addition, some, proto, elamite, sites, are, found, well, outside, this, area, spread, out, on, the, iranian, plateau, such, as, warakshe, sialk, now, a, suburb, of, the, modern, city, of, kashan, and, jiroft, in, kerman, province, the, state, of, elam, was, formed, from, these, lesser, states, as, a, response, to, invasion, from, sumer, during, the, old, elamite, period, elamite, strength, was, based, on, an, ability, to, hold, these, various, areas, together, under, a, coordinated, government, that, permitted, the, maximum, interchange, of, the, natural, resources, unique, to, each, region, traditionally, this, was, done, through, a, federated, governmental, structure, the, proto, elamite, city, of, susa, was, founded, around, 4000, bc, in, the, watershed, of, the, river, karun, it, is, considered, to, be, the, site, of, proto, elamite, cultural, formation, during, its, early, history, it, fluctuated, between, submission, to, mesopotamian, and, elamite, power, the, earliest, levels, 22, 17, in, the, excavations, conducted, by, le, brun, 1978, exhibit, pottery, that, has, no, equivalent, in, mesopotamia, but, for, the, succeeding, period, the, excavated, material, allows, identification, with, the, culture, of, sumer, of, the, uruk, period, proto, elamite, influence, from, mesopotamia, in, susa, becomes, visible, from, about, 3200, bc, and, texts, in, the, still, undeciphered, proto, elamite, writing, system, continue, to, be, present, until, about, 2700, bc, the, proto, elamite, period, ends, with, the, establishment, of, the, awan, dynasty, the, earliest, known, historical, figure, connected, with, elam, is, the, king, enmebaragesi, of, kish, c, 2650, bc, who, subdued, it, according, to, the, sumerian, king, list, elamite, history, can, only, be, traced, from, records, dating, to, beginning, of, the, akkadian, empire, 2335, 2154, bc, onwards, the, proto, elamite, states, in, jiroft, and, zabol, not, universally, accepted, present, a, special, case, because, of, their, great, antiquity, in, ancient, luristan, bronze, making, tradition, goes, back, to, the, mid, 3rd, millennium, bc, and, has, many, elamite, connections, bronze, objects, from, several, cemeteries, in, the, region, date, to, the, early, dynastic, period, mesopotamia, i, and, to, ur, iii, period, c, 2900, 2000, bc, these, excavations, include, kalleh, nisar, bani, surmah, chigha, sabz, kamtarlan, sardant, and, gulal, i, galbi, the, old, elamite,

twelve, kings, of, each, of, the, first, two, dynasties, those, of, awan, or, avan, c, 2400, c, 2100, bc, and, simashki, c, 2100, c, 1970, bc, are, known, from, a, list, from, susa, dating, to, the, old, babylonian, period, two, elamite, dynasties, said, to, have, exercised, brief, control, over, parts, of, sumer, in, very, early, times, include, awan, and, hamazi, and, likewise, several, of, the, stronger, sumerian, rulers, such, as, eannatum, of, lagash, and, lugal, anne, mundu, of, adab, are, recorded, as, temporarily, dominating, elam, the, awan, dynasty, 2350, 2150, bc, was, partly, contemporary, with, that, of, the, mesopotamian, emperor, sargon, of, akkad, who, not, only, defeated, the, awan, king, luh, ishan, and, subjected, susa, but, attempted, to, make, the, east, semitic, akkadian, the, official, language, there, from, this, time, mesopotamian, sources, concerning, elam, become, more, frequent, since, the, mesopotamians, had, developed, an, interest, in, resources, such, as, wood, stone, and, metal, from, the, iranian, plateau, and, military, expeditions, to, the, area, became, more, common, with, the, collapse, of, akkad, under, sargon, s, great, great, grandson, shar, kali, sharri, elam, declared, independence, under, the, last, awan, king, kutik, inshushinak, c, 2240, c, 2220, bc, and, threw, off, the, akkadian, language, promoting, in, its, place, the, brief, linear, elamite, script, kutik, inshushinnak, conquered, susa, and, anshan, and, seems, to, have, achieved, some, sort, of, political, unity, following, his, reign, the, awan, dynasty, collapsed, as, elam, was, temporarily, overrun, by, the, guti, another, pre, iranic, people, from, what, is, now, north, west, iran, who, also, spoke, a, language, isolate, about, a, century, later, the, sumerian, king, shulgi, of, the, neo, sumerian, empire, retook, the, city, of, susa, and, the, surrounding, region, during, the, first, part, of, the, rule, of, the, simashki, dynasty, elam, was, under, intermittent, attack, from, the, sumerians, of, mesopotamia, and, also, gutians, from, northwestern, iran, alternating, with, periods, of, peace, and, diplomatic, approaches, the, elamite, state, of, simashki, at, this, time, also, extended, into, northern, iran, and, possibly, even, as, far, as, the, caspian, sea, shu, sin, of, ur, gave, one, of, his, daughters, in, marriage, to, a, prince, of, anshan, but, the, power, of, the, sumerians, was, waning, ibbi, sin, in, the, 21st, century, did, not, manage, to, penetrate, far, into, elam, and, in, 2004, bc, the, elamites, allied, with, the, people, of, susa, and, led, by, king, kindattu, the, sixth, king, of, simashki, managed, to, sack, ur, and, lead, ibbi, sin, into, captivity, ending, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, the, akkadian, kings, of, isin, successor, state, to, ur, managed, to, drive, the, elamites, out, of, ur, rebuild, the, city, and, to, return, the, statue, of, nanna, that, the, elamites, had, plundered, the, succeeding, dynasty, often, called, the, sukkalmah, dynasty, c, 1970, c, 1770, bc, after, great, regents, the, title, borne, by, its, members, also, called, the, epartid, dynasty, after, the, name, of, its, founder, ebarat, eparti, was, roughly, contemporary, with, the, old, assyrian, empire, and, old, babylonian, period, in, mesopotamia, being, younger, by, approximately, sixty, years, than, the, akkadian, speaking, old, assyrian, empire, in, upper, mesopotamia, and, almost, seventy, five, years, older, than, the, old, babylonian, empire, this, period, is, said, by, many, to, be, confusing, and, difficult, to, reconstruct, it, was, apparently, founded, by, eparti, i, during, this, time, susa, was, under, elamite, control, but, akkadian, speaking, mesopotamian, states, such, as, larsa, and, isin, continually, tried, to, retake, the, city, around, 1850, bc, kudur, mabuk, apparently, king, of, another, akkadian, state, to, the, north, of, larsa, managed, to, install, his,

elam, during, this, time, include, suruhduh, siruk, tuh, sirukdukh, c, 1850, bc, who, entered, various, military, coalitions, to, contain, the, power, of, the, south, mesopotamian, states, siruk, tuh, was, the, king, of, elam, when, hammurabi, first, ruled, he, and, later, kings, of, the, elamite, dynasty, were, referred, to, as, great, king, and, father, by, kings, in, syria, and, mesopotamia, and, were, the, only, kings, that, the, mesopotamian, kings, considered, to, be, higher, in, status, than, themselves, siwe, palar, khuppak, who, for, some, time, was, the, most, powerful, person, in, the, area, respectfully, addressed, as, father, by, mesopotamian, kings, such, as, zimrilim, of, mari, shamshi, adad, i, of, assyria, and, even, hammurabi, of, babylon, during, his, reign, alone, elam, interfered, extensively, with, mesopotamian, politics, allowing, messengers, and, envoys, to, travel, far, west, to, emar, and, qatna, in, syria, his, messenger, reached, emar, and, sent, his, three, servants, to, king, amut, pi, el, ii, of, qatna, 1772, 1762, bc, and, the, king, of, qatna, also, sent, two, messengers, to, elam, the, elamite, rulers, had, become, increasingly, involved, in, mesopotamian, politics, during, the, sukkalmah, dynasty, in, fact, rim, sin, of, larsa, himself, was, of, elamite, descent, notwithstanding, his, akkadian, name, kudur, nahhunte, who, plundered, the, temples, of, southern, mesopotamia, the, north, being, under, the, control, of, the, old, assyrian, empire, but, elamite, influence, in, southern, mesopotamia, did, not, last, around, 1760, bc, hammurabi, drove, out, the, elamites, overthrew, rim, sin, of, larsa, and, established, a, short, lived, babylonian, empire, in, mesopotamia, little, is, known, about, the, latter, part, of, this, dynasty, since, sources, again, become, sparse, with, the, kassite, rule, of, babylon, from, c, 1595, bc, many, archaeological, finds, suggest, that, maritime, trade, along, the, shores, of, africa, and, asia, started, several, millennia, ago, trade, between, the, indus, valley, civilization, and, the, cities, of, mesopotamia, and, elam, can, be, inferred, from, numerous, find, of, indus, artifacts, particularly, in, the, excavation, at, susa, various, objects, made, with, shell, species, that, are, characteristic, of, the, indus, coast, particularly, trubinella, pyrum, and,

to, a, technique, of, acid, etching, developed, by, the, harappans, exchanges, seem, to, have, waned, after, 1900, bc, together, with, the, disappearance, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, the,

religion, must, have, been, characterized, by, the, ill, defined, character, of, the, individual, gods, and, goddesses, most, of, them, were, not, only, ineffable, beings, whose, real, name, was, either, not, uttered, or, was, unknown, but, also, sublime, ideas, not, to, be, exactly, defined, by, the, human, race, 403, worship, also, varied, between, localities, 401, however, more, recent, scholarship, shows, that, elamite, deities, most, likely, were, not, any, less, defined, than, these, of, their, sumerian, akkadian, and, hurrian, neighbors, inscriptions, of, many, elamite, kings, indicate, that, a, concept, of, a, supreme, triad, consisting, of, inshushinak, originally, the, civic, protector, god, of, susa, eventually, the, leader, of, the, triad, 401, and, guarantor, of, the, monarchy, kiririsha, an, earth, mother, goddess, in, southern, elam, 406, and, napirisha, existed, in, the, neo, elamite, period, humban, previously, a, deity, of, limited, relevance, in, known, sources, emerged, as, a, divine, source, of, royal, power, another, significant, deity, was, pinikir, an, astral, goddess, of, love, similar, to, ishtar, some, researchers, especially, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, saw, her, as, a, mother, goddess, and, possibly, originally, chief, deity, in, northern, elam, 400, later, supplanted, by, or, identified, with, kiririsha, but, this, view, is, no, longer, supported, by, scholars, there, were, also, imported, deities, such, as, beltiya, nergal, or, nanaya, some, native, elamite, deities, had, akkadian, or, sumerian, names, as, well, ex, manzat, inshushinak, and, his, attendants, indicating, a, long, history, of, interchange, some, elamite, deities, were, also, venerated, outside, elam, pinikir, was, known, to, the, hurrians, and, hittites,

a, language, isolate, and, completely, unrelated, to, the, neighbouring, semitic, languages, sumerian, and, kassite, hurrian, also, isolates, and, the, later, arriving, indo, european, iranian, languages, that, came, to, dominate, the, region, of, elam, from, the, 6th, century, bc, it, was, written, in, a, cuneiform, adapted, from, the, semitic, akkadian, script, of, assyria, and, babylonia, although, the, very, earliest, documents, were, written, in, the, quite, different, linear, elamite, script, in, 2006, two, even, older, inscriptions, in, a, similar, script, were, discovered, at, jiroft, to, the, east, of, elam, leading, archaeologists, to, speculate, that, linear, elamite, had, originally, spread, from, further, east, to, susa, it, seems, to, have, developed, from, an, even, earlier, writing, known, as, proto, elamite, but, scholars, are, not, unanimous, on, whether, or, not, this, script, was, used, to, write, elamite, or, another, language, as, it, has, not, yet, been, deciphered, several, stages, of, the, language, are, attested, the, earliest, date, back, to, the, third, millennium, bc, the, latest, to, the, achaemenid, empire, the, elamite, language, may, have, survived, as, late, as, the, early, islamic, period, roughly, contemporary, with, the, early, medieval, period, in, europe, among, other, islamic, medieval, historians, ibn, al, nadim, for, instance, wrote, that, the, iranian, languages, are, fahlavi, pahlavi, dari, not, to, be, confused, with, dari, persian, in, modern, afghanistan, khuzi, persian, and, suryani, assyrian, and, ibn, moqaffa, noted, that, khuzi, was, the, unofficial, language, of, the, royalty, of, persia, khuz, being, the, corrupted, name, for, elam, while, elamite, is, viewed, as, a, language, isolate, by, the, vast, majority, of, linguists, a, minority, of, scholars, have, proposed, that, the, elamite, language, could, be, related, to, the, dravidian, languages, david, mcalpine, believes, elamite, may, be, related, to, the, living, dravidian, languages, this, hypothesis, which, has, been, subject, to, serious, criticism, by, linguists, is, considered, under, the, rubric, of, elamo, dravidian, languages, the, assyrians, had, utterly, destroyed, the, elamite, nation, but, new, polities, emerged, in, the, area, after, assyrian, power, faded, among, the, nations, that, benefited, from, the, decline, of,

of, ashurbanipal, in, 627, bc, after, his, death, the, medes, played, a, major, role, in, the, destruction, of, the, weakened, assyrian, empire, in, 612, bc, the, rise, of, the, achaemenids, in, the,
