approximately, 1434, the, unrest, began, after, pre, protestant, christian, reformer, jan, hus, was, executed, by, the, catholic, church, in, 1415, for, heresy, because, king, wenceslaus, iv, of, bohemia, had, plans, to, be, crowned, the, holy, roman, emperor, requiring, papal, coronation, he, suppressed, the, religion, of, the, hussites, yet, it, continued, to, spread, when, king, wenceslaus, iv, died, of, natural, causes, a, few, years, later, the, tension, stemming, from, the, hussites, grew, stronger, in, prague, and, various, other, parts, of, bohemia, the, catholic, germans, living, there, were, forced, out, wenceslaus, s, brother, sigismund, who, had, inherited, the, throne, was, outraged, by, the, spread, of, hussitism, he, received, permission, from, the, pope, to, launch, a, crusade, against, the, hussites, and, large, numbers, of, crusaders, came, from, all, over, europe, to, fight, they, made, early, advances, forcing, the, hussites, back, and, taking, prague, however, the, hussites, reorganized, and, took, back, nearly, all, the, land, they, had, lost, resulting, in, the, failure, of, the, crusade, after, the, reins, of, the, hussite, army, were, handed, over, to, yeoman, jan, i, ka, internal, strife, followed, seeing, that, the, hussites, were, weakened, the, germans, undertook, another, crusade, but, were, defeated, by, i, ka, at, the, battle, of, n, meck,

conflicts, went, on, the, hussites, also, made, raids, into, german, territory, the, wars, eventually, ended, in, 1434, when, the, moderate, utraquist, faction, of, the, hussites, defeated, the, radical, taborite, faction, the, hussites, agreed, to, submit, to, the, authority, of, the, king, of, bohemia, and, the, roman, catholic, church, and, were, allowed, to, practice, their, somewhat, variant, rite, the, hussite, community, included, much, of, the, czech, population, of, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, and, formed, a, major, spontaneous, military, power, the, hussite, wars, were, notable, for, the, extensive, use, of, early, handheld, firearms, such, as, hand, cannons, and, wagon, forts, by, the, hussites, starting, around, 1402, priest, and, scholar, jan, hus, denounced, what, he, judged, as, the, corruption, of, the, church, and, the, papacy, and, he, promoted, some, of, the, reformist, ideas, of, english, theologian, john, wycliffe, his, preaching, was, widely, heeded, in, bohemia, and, provoked, suppression, by, the, church, which, had, declared, many, of, wycliffe, s, ideas, heretical, in, 1411, in, the, course, of, the, western, schism, antipope, john, xxiii, proclaimed, a, crusade, against, king, ladislaus, of, naples, the, protector, of, rival, pope, gregory, xii, to, raise, money, for, this, he, proclaimed, indulgences, in, bohemia, hus, bitterly, denounced, this, and, explicitly, quoted, wycliffe, against, it, provoking, further, complaints, of, heresy, but, winning, much, support, in, bohemia, in, 1414, sigismund, of, hungary, convened, the, council, of, constance, to, end, the, schism, and, resolve, other, religious, controversies, hus, went, to, the, council, under, a, safe, conduct, from, sigismund, but, was, imprisoned, tried, and, executed, on, 6, july, 1415, the, knights, and, nobles, of, bohemia, and, moravia, who, were, in, favour, of, church, reform, sent, the, protestatio, bohemorum, to, the, council, of, constance, on, 2, september, 1415, which, condemned, the, execution, of, hus, in, the, strongest, language, this, angered, sigismund, who, was, king, of, the, romans, head, of, the, holy, roman, empire, though, not, yet, emperor, and, brother, of, king, wenceslaus, of, bohemia, he, had, been, persuaded, by, the, council, that, hus, was, a, heretic, he, sent, threatening, letters, to, bohemia, declaring, that, he, would, shortly, drown, all, wycliffites, and, hussites, greatly, incensing, the, people, disorder, broke, out, in, various, parts, of, bohemia, and, drove, many, catholic, priests, from, their, parishes, almost, from, the, beginning, the, hussites, were, divided, into, two, main, groups, though, many, minor, divisions, also, arose, among, them, shortly, before, his, death, hus, had, accepted, the, doctrine, of, utraquism, preached, during, his, absence, by, his, adherents, at, prague, the, obligation, of, the, faithful, to, receive, communion, in, both, kinds, bread, and, wine, sub, utraque, specie, this, doctrine, became, the, watchword, of, the, moderate, hussites, known, as, the, utraquists, or, calixtines, from, the, latin, calix, the, chalice, in, czech, kali, n, ci, from, kalich, the, more, extreme, hussites, became, known, as, taborites, t, borit, after, the, town, of, t, bor, which, became, their, centre, or, orphans, sirotci, a, name, they, adopted, after, the, death, of, their, leader, and, general, jan, i, ka, under, the, influence, of, sigismund, wenceslaus, endeavoured, to, stem, the, hussite, movement, a, number, of, hussites, led, by, mikul, of, hus, left, prague, they, held, meetings, in, various, parts, of, bohemia, particularly, at, sezimovo, st, near, the, spot, where, the, town, of, t, bor, was, founded, soon, afterwards, at, these, meetings, they, violently, denounced, sigismund, and, the, people, everywhere, prepared, for, war, in, spite, of, the, departure, of, many, prominent, hussites, the, troubles, at, prague, continued, on, 30, july, 1419, a, hussite, procession, headed, by, the, priest, jan, elivsk, attacked, new, town, hall, in, prague, and, threw, the, king, s, representatives, the, burgomaster, and, some, town, councillors, from, the, windows, into, the, street, the, first, defenestration, of, prague, where, several, were, killed, by, the, fall, after, a, rock, was, allegedly, thrown, from, the, town, hall, and, hit, elivsk, it, has, been, suggested, that, wenceslaus, was, so, stunned, by, the, defenestration, that, it, caused, his, death, on, 16, august, 1419, alternatively, it, is, possible, that, he, may, have, just, died, of, natural, causes, the, death, of, wenceslaus, resulted, in, renewed, troubles, in, prague, and, in, almost, all, parts, of, bohemia, many, catholics, mostly, germans, mostly, still, faithful, to, the, pope, were, expelled, from, the, bohemian, cities, wenceslaus, s, widow, sophia, of, bavaria, acting, as, regent, in, bohemia, hurriedly, collected, a, force, of, mercenaries, and, tried, to, gain, control, of, prague, which, led, to, severe, fighting, after, a, considerable, part, of, the, city, had, been, damaged, or, destroyed, the, parties, declared, a, truce, on, 13, november, the, nobles, sympathetic, to, the, hussite, cause, but, supporting, the, regent, promised, to, act, as, mediators, with, sigismund, while, the, citizens, of, prague, consented, to, restore, to, the, royal, forces, the, castle, of, vy, ehrad, which, had, fallen, into, their, hands, i, ka, who, disapproved, of, this, compromise, left, prague, and, retired, to, plze, unable, to, maintain, himself, there, he, marched, to, southern, bohemia, he, defeated, the, catholics, at, the, battle, of, sudom, 25, march, 1420, the, first, pitched, battle, of, the, hussite, wars, after, sudom, he, moved, to, st, one, of, the, earliest, meeting, places, of, the, hussites, not, considering, its, situation, sufficiently, strong, he, moved, to, the, neighboring, new, settlement, of, the, hussites, called, by, the, biblical, name, of, t, bor, t, bor, soon, became, the, center, of, the, most, militant, hussites, who, differed, from, the, utraquists, by, recognizing, only, two, sacraments, baptism, and, communion, and, by, rejecting, most, of, the, ceremony, of, the, roman, catholic, church, the, ecclesiastical, organization, of, tabor, had, a, somewhat, puritanical, character, and, the, government, was, established, on, a, thoroughly, democratic, basis, four, captains, of, the, people, hejtman, were, elected, one, of, whom, was, i, ka, and, a, very, strict, military, discipline, was, instituted, late, 14th, and, early, 15th, century, saw, gradually, increasing, use, of, firearms, in, siege, operations, both, by, defenders, and, attackers, weight, lack, of, accuracy, and, cumbersome, use, of, early, types, limited, their, employment, to, static, operations, and, prevented, wider, use, in, open, battlefield, or, by, civilian, individuals, nevertheless, lack, of, guild, monopolies, and, low, training, requirements, led, to, their, relatively, low, price, this, together, with, high, effectiveness, against, armour, led, to, their, popularity, for, castle, and, town, defenses, when, the, hussite, revolt, started, in, 1419, the, hussite, militias, heavily, depended, on, converted, farm, equipment, and, weapons, looted, from, castle, and, town, armories, including, early, firearms, hussite, militia, comprised, mostly, commoners, without, prior, military, experience, and, included, both, men, and, women, use, of, crossbows, and, firearms, became, critical, as, those, weapons, didn, t, require, extensive, training, nor, did, their, effectiveness, rely, on, the, operator, s, physical, strength, firearms, were, first, used, in, the, field, as, a, provisional, last, resort, together, with, wagon, forts, significantly, outnumbered, hussite, militia, led, by, jan, i, ka, repulsed, surprise, assaults, by, heavy, cavalry, during, the, battle, of, nekm, in, december, 1419, and, the, battle, of, sudom, in, march, 1420, in, these, battles, i, ka, employed, transport, carriages, as, wagon, forts, to, stop, the, enemy, s, cavalry, charge, the, main, weight, of, the, fighting, rested, on, militiamen, armed, with, cold, weapons, but, firearms, shooting, from, behind, the, safety, of, the, wagon, forts, proved, to, be, very, effective, following, this, experience, i, ka, ordered, mass, manufacturing, of, war, wagons, according, to, a, universal, template, as, well, as, manufacturing, of, new, types, of, firearms, that, would, be, more, suitable, for, use, in, the, open, battlefield, throughout, 1420, and, most, of, 1421, the, hussite, tactical, use, of, wagon, forts, and, firearms, was, defensive, the, wagon, s, wall, was, stationary, and, firearms, were, used, to, break, the, initial, charge, of, the, enemy, after, this, firearms, played, an, auxiliary, role, supporting, mainly, cold, weapons, based, defense, at, the, level, of, the, wagon, wall, counterattacks, were, done, by, cold, weapons, armed, infantry, and, cavalry, charges, outside, of, the, wagon, forts, the, first, mobile, use, of, war, wagons, and, firearms, took, place, during, the, hussite, breakthrough, of, catholic, encirclement, at, vlada, hill, in, november, 1421, at, the, battle, of, lutice, the, wagons, and, firearms, were, used, on, the, move, at, this, point, still, only, defensively, i, ka, avoided, the, main, camp, of, the, enemy, and, employed, the, moving, wagon, forts, in, order, to, cover, his, retreating, troops, the, first, true, engagement, where, firearms, played, primary, role, happened, a, month, later, during, the, battle, of, kutn, hora, i, ka, positioned, his, forces, between, the, town, of, kutn, hora, which, pledged, allegiance, to, the, hussite, cause, and, the, main, camp, of, the, enemy, leaving, supplies, in, the, well, defended, town, however, uprising, of, ethnic, german, townsmen, led, the, town, into, crusader, s, control, late, in, the, night, between, 21, and, 22, december, 1421, i, ka, ordered, an, attack, against, the, enemy, s, main, camp, the, attack, was, conducted, by, using, a, gradually, moving, wagon, wall, instead, of, the, usual, infantry, raids, beyond, the, wagons, the, attack, relied, mainly, on, the, use, of, ranged, weapons, from, the, moving, wagons, nighttime, use, of, firearms, proved, extremely, effective, not, only, practically, but, also, psychologically, the, year, 1421, marked, not, only, a, shift, in, the, importance, of, firearms, from, auxiliary, to, primary, weapons, of, hussite, militia, but, also, the, establishment, of, the, slav, diet, of, formal, legal, duty, for, all, inhabitants, to, obey, the, call, to, arms, of, the, elected, provisional, government, for, the, first, time, in, medieval, european, history, this, was, not, put, in, place, in, order, to, fulfill, duties, to, a, feudal, lord, or, to, the, church, but, in, order, to, participate, in, the, defense, of, the, country, firearms, design, underwent, fast, development, during, the, hussite, wars, and, their, civilian, possession, became, a, matter, of, course, throughout, the, war, as, well, as, after, its, end, in, 1434, the, word, used, for, one, type, of, handheld, firearm, used, by, the, hussites, czech, p, ala, later, found, its, way, through, german, and, french, into, english, as, the, term, pistol, the, name, of, a, cannon, used, by, the, hussites, the, czech, houfnice, gave, rise, to, the, english, term, howitzer, houf, meaning, crowd, for, its, intended, use, of, shooting, stone, and, iron, shots, against, mass, enemy, forces, other, types, of, firearms, commonly, used, by, the, hussites, included, h, kovnice, an, infantry, weapon, heavier, than, p, ala, and, tarasnice, fauconneau, as, regards, cannons, apart, from, houfnice, hussites, employed, bombarda, mortar, and, d, lo, cannon, after, the, death, of, his, childless, brother, wenceslaus, sigismund, inherited, a, claim, on, the, bohemian, crown, though, it, was, then, and, remained, until, much, later, in, question, whether, bohemia, was, a, hereditary, or, an, elective, monarchy, especially, since, the, line, through, which, sigismund, claimed, the, throne, had, accepted, that, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, was, an, elective, monarchy, elected, by, the, nobles, and, thus, the, regent, of, the, kingdom, en, k, of, wartenberg, also, explicitly, stated, that, sigismund, had, not, been, elected, as, a, reason, for, sigismund, s, claim, to, not, be, accepted, a, firm, adherent, of, the, church, of, rome, sigismund, was, aided, by, pope, martin, v, who, issued, a, bull, on, 17, march, 1420, proclaiming, a, crusade, for, the, destruction, of, the, wycliffites, hussites, and, all, other, heretics, in, bohemia, sigismund, and, many, german, princes, arrived, before, prague, on, 30, june, at, the, head, of, a, vast, army, of, crusaders, from, all, parts, of, europe, largely, consisting, of, adventurers, attracted, by, the, hope, of, pillage, they, immediately, began, a, siege, of, the, city, which, had, however, soon, to, be, abandoned, negotiations, took, place, for, a, settlement, of, the, religious, differences, the, united, hussites, formulated, their, demands, in, a, statement, known, as, the, four, articles, of, prague, this, document, the, most, important, of, the, hussite, period, ran, in, the, wording, of, the, contemporary, chronicler, laurence, of, brezova, as, follows, 1, the, word, of, god, shall, be, preached, and, made, known, in, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, freely, and, in, an, orderly, manner, by, the, priests, of, the, lord, 2, the, sacrament, of, the, most, holy, eucharist, shall, be, freely, administered, in, the, two, kinds, that, is, bread, and, wine, to, all, the, faithful, in, christ, who, are, not, precluded, by, mortal, sin, according, to, the, word, and, disposition, of, our, saviour, 3, the, secular, power, over, riches, and, worldly, goods, which, the, clergy, possesses, in, contradiction, to, christ, s, precept, to, the, prejudice, of, its, office, and, to, the, detriment, of, the, secular, arm, shall, be, taken, and, withdrawn, from, it, and, the, clergy, itself, shall, be, brought, back, to, the, evangelical, rule, and, an, apostolic, life, such, as, that, which, christ, and, his, apostles, led, 4, all, mortal, sins, and, in, particular, all, public, and, other, disorders, which, are, contrary, to, god, s, law, shall, in, every, rank, of, life, be, duly, and, judiciously, prohibited, and, destroyed, by, those, whose, office, it, is, these, articles, which, contain, the, essence, of, the, hussite, doctrine, were, rejected, by, king, sigismund, mainly, through, the, influence, of, the, papal, legates, who, considered, them, prejudicial, to, the, authority, of, the, pope, hostilities, therefore, continued, however, sigismund, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, v, tkov, hill, on, july, 1420, though, sigismund, had, retired, from, prague, his, troops, held, the, castles, of, vy, ehrad, and, hrad, any, the, citizens, of, prague, laid, siege, to, vy, ehrad, see, battle, of, vy, ehrad, and, towards, the, end, of, october, 1420, the, garrison, was, on, the, point, of, capitulating, through, famine, sigismund, tried, to, relieve, the, fortress, but, was, decisively, defeated, by, the, hussites, on, 1, november, near, the, village, of, pankr, c, the, castles, of, vy, ehrad, and, hrad, any, now, capitulated, and, shortly, afterwards, almost, all, bohemia, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, hussites, internal, troubles, prevented, the, followers, of, hus, from, fully, capitalizing, on, their, victory, at, prague, a, demagogue, the, priest, jan, elivsk, for, a, time, obtained, almost, unlimited, authority, over, the, lower, classes, of, the, townsmen, and, at, t, bor, a, religious, communistic, movement, that, of, the, so, called, adamites, was, sternly, suppressed, by, i, ka, shortly, afterwards, a, new, crusade, against, the, hussites, was, undertaken, a, large, german, army, entered, bohemia, and, in, august, 1421, laid, siege, to, the, town, of, atec, after, an, unsuccessful, attempt, of, storming, the, city, the, crusaders, retreated, somewhat, ingloriously, on, hearing, that, the, hussite, troops, were, approaching, sigismund, only, arrived, in, bohemia, at, the, end, of, 1421, he, took, possession, of, the, town, of, kutn, hora, but, was, decisively, defeated, by, jan, i, ka, at, the, battle, of, n, meck, brod, on, 6, january, 1422, bohemia, was, for, a, time, free, from, foreign, intervention, but, internal, discord, again, broke, out, caused, partly, by, theological, strife, and, partly, by, the, ambition, of, agitators, on, 9, march, 1422, jan, elivsk, was, arrested, by, the, town, council, of, prague, and, beheaded, there, were, troubles, at, t, bor, also, where, a, more, radical, party, opposed, i, ka, s, authority, the, hussites, were, aided, at, various, times, by, poland, because, of, this, jan, i, ka, arranged, for, the, crown, of, bohemia, to, be, offered, to, king, w, adys, aw, ii, jagie, o, of, poland, who, under, pressure, from, his, own, advisors, refused, it, the, crown, was, then, offered, to, w, adys, aw, s, cousin, vytautas, the, grand, duke, of, lithuania, vytautas, accepted, it, with, the, condition, that, the, hussites, reunite, with, the, catholic, church, in, 1422, i, ka, accepted, prince, sigismund, korybut, of, lithuania, nephew, of, w, adys, aw, ii, as, regent, of, bohemia, for, vytautas, his, authority, was, recognized, by, the, utraquist, nobles, the, citizens, of, prague, and, the, more, moderate, of, the, taborites, but, he, failed, to, bring, the, hussites, back, into, the, church, on, a, few, occasions, he, fought, against, both, the, taborites, and, the, orebites, to, try, to, force, them, into, reuniting, after, w, adys, aw, ii, and, vytautas, signed, the, treaty, of, melno, with, sigismund, of, hungary, in, 1423, they, recalled, sigismund, korybut, to, lithuania, under, pressure, from, sigismund, of, hungary, and, the, pope, on, his, departure,

the, hussites, and, king, eric, vii, of, denmark, who, had, landed, in, germany, with, a, large, force, intending, to, take, part, in, the, crusade, soon, returned, to, his, own, country, free, for, a, time, from, foreign, threat, the, hussites, invaded, moravia, where, a, large, part, of, the, population, favored, their, creed, but, paralysed, again, by, dissensions, they, soon, returned, to, bohemia, the, city, of, hradec, kr, lov, which, had, been, under, utraquist, rule, espoused, the, doctrine, of, t, bor, and, called, i, ka, to, its, aid, after, several, military, successes, gained, by, i, ka, in, 1423, and, the, following, year, a, treaty, of, peace, between, the, hussite, factions, was, concluded, on, 13, september, 1424, at, libe, a, village, near, prague, now, part, of, that,
