the, bantu, expansion, was, a, major, series, of, migrations, of, the, original, proto, bantu, speaking, group, which, spread, from, an, original, nucleus, around, west, central, africa, in, the, process, the, proto, bantu, speaking, settlers, displaced, eliminated, or, absorbed, pre, existing, hunter, gatherer, and, pastoralist, groups, that, they, encountered, there, is, linguistic, evidence, for, this, expansion, a, great, many, of, the, languages, which, are, spoken, across, sub, equatorial, africa, are, remarkably, similar, to, each, other, suggesting, the, common, cultural, origin, of, their, original, speakers, the, linguistic, core, of, the, bantu, languages, which, comprise, a, branch, of, the, atlantic, congo, language, family, was, located, in, the, southern, regions, of, cameroon, genetic, evidence, also, indicates, that, there, was, a, large, human, migration, from, central, africa, with, varying, levels, of, admixture, with, local, population, the, expansion, is, believed, to, have, taken, place, in, at, least, two, waves, between, about, 4, 000, and, 2, 000, years, ago, approximately, 2, 000, bc, to, ad, 1, linguistic, analysis, suggests, that, the, expansion, proceeded, in, two, directions, the, first, went, across, or, along, the, northern, border, of, the, congo, forest, region, towards, east, africa, and, the, second, and, possibly, others, went, south, along, africa, s, atlantic, coast, into, what, is, now, the, republic, of, the, congo, gabon, cameroon, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, angola, or, inland, along, the, many, south, to, north, flowing, rivers, of, the, congo, river, system, the, expansion, reached, south, africa, probably, as, early, as, ad, 300, bantuists, believe, that, the, bantu, expansion, most, probably, began, on, the, highlands, between, cameroon, and, nigeria, the, 60, 000, km, 2, mambilla, region, straddling, the, borderlands, here, has, been, identified, as, containing, remnants, of, the, bantu, who, stayed, home, as, the, bulk, of, bantu, speakers, moved, away, from, the, region, archaeological, evidence, from, the, separate, works, of, jean, hurault, 1979, 1986, and, 1988, and, rigobert, tuech, 2000, in, the, region, indicates, cultural, continuity, from, 3000, bc, until, today, the, majority, of, the, groups, of, the, bamenda, highlands, occupied, for, 2000, years, until, today, somewhat, south, and, contiguous, with, the, mambilla, region, have, an, ancient, history, of, descent, from, the, north, in, the, direction, of, the, mambilla, region, initially, archaeologists, believed, that, they, could, find, archaeological, similarities, in, the, region, s, ancient, cultures, that, the, bantu, speakers, were, held, to, have, traversed, linguists, classifying, the, languages, and, creating, a, genealogical, table, of, relationships, believed, they, could, reconstruct, material, culture, elements, they, believed, that, the, expansion, was, caused, by, the, development, of, agriculture, the, making, of, ceramics, and, the, use, of, iron, which, permitted, new, ecological, zones, to, be, exploited, in, 1966, roland, oliver, published, an, article, presenting, these, correlations, as, a, reasonable, hypothesis, the, hypothesized, bantu, expansion, pushed, out, or, assimilated, the, hunter, forager, proto, khoisan, who, had, formerly, inhabited, southern, africa, in, eastern, and, southern, africa, bantu, speakers, may, have, adopted, livestock, husbandry, from, other, unrelated, cushitic, and, nilotic, speaking, peoples, they, encountered, herding, practices, reached, the, far, south, several, centuries, before, bantu, speaking, migrants, did, archaeological, linguistic, genetic, and, environmental, evidence, all, support, the, conclusion, that, the, bantu, expansion, was, a, significant, human, migration, generally, the, movements, of, bantu, language, speaking, peoples, from, the, cameroon, nigeria, border, region, throughout, much, of, sub, saharan, africa, radically, reshaped, the, genetic, structure, of, the, continent, and, led, to, extensive, admixture, between, migrants, and, local, populations, a, 2023, genetic, study, of, 1, 487, bantu, speakers, sampled, from, 143, populations, across, 14, african, countries, revealed, that, the, expansion, occurred, 4, 000, years, ago, in, western, africa, the, results, showed, that, bantu, speakers, received, significant, gene, flow, from, local, groups, in, regions, they, expanded, into, based, on, dental, evidence, irish, 2016, concluded, that, the, common, ancestors, of, west, african, and, proto, bantu, peoples, may, have, originated, in, the, western, region, of, the, sahara, amid, the, kiffian, period, at, gobero, and, may, have, migrated, southward, from, the, sahara, into, various, parts, of, west, africa, e, g, benin, cameroon, ghana, nigeria, togo, as, a, result, of, desertification, of, the, green, sahara, in, 7000, bc, from, nigeria, and, cameroon, agricultural, proto, bantu, peoples, began, to, migrate, and, amid, migration, diverged, into, east, bantu, peoples, e, g, democratic, republic, of, congo, and, west, bantu, peoples, e, g, congo, gabon, between, 2500, bc, and, 1200, bc, he, suggests, that, igbo, people, and, yoruba, people, may, have, admixture, from, back, migrated, bantu, peoples, the, atlantic, congo, family, comprises, a, huge, group, of, languages, spread, throughout, western, central, and, southern, africa, the, benue, congo, branch, includes, the, bantu, languages, which, are, found, throughout, central, southern, and, eastern, africa, a, characteristic, feature, of, most, atlantic, congo, languages, including, almost, all, the, bantu, languages, except, swahili, sotho, tswana, and, nguni, languages, is, their, use, of, tone, they, generally, lack, case, inflection, but, grammatical, gender, is, characteristic, with, some, languages, having, two, dozen, genders, noun, classes, the, root, of, the, verb, tends, to, remain, unchanged, with, either, particles, or, auxiliary, verbs, expressing, tenses, and, moods, for, example, in, a, number, of, languages, the, infinitival, is, the, auxiliary, designating, the, future, before, the, expansion, of, bantu, speaking, farmers, central, southern, and, southeast, africa, were, likely, populated, by, pygmy, foragers, khoisan, speaking, hunter, gatherers, nilo, saharan, speaking, herders, and, cushitic, speaking, pastoralists, it, is, thought, that, central, african, pygmies, and, bantus, branched, out, from, a, common, ancestral, population, c, 70, 000, years, ago, many, batwa, groups, speak, bantu, languages, however, a, considerable, portion, of, their, vocabulary, is, not, bantu, in, origin, much, of, this, vocabulary, is, botanical, deals, with, honey, collecting, or, is, otherwise, specialised, for, the, forest, and, is, shared, between, western, batwa, groups, it, has, been, proposed, that, this, is, the, remnant, of, an, independent, western, batwa, mbenga, or, baaka, language, before, the, bantu, expansion, khoisan, speaking, peoples, inhabited, southern, africa, their, descendants, have, largely, mixed, with, other, peoples, and, adopted, other, languages, a, few, still, live, by, foraging, often, supplemented, by, working, for, neighbouring, farmers, in, the, arid, regions, around, the, kalahari, desert, while, a, larger, number, of, nama, continue, their, traditional, subsistence, by, raising, livestock, in, namibia, and, adjacent, south, africa, prior, to, the, arrival, of, bantus, in, southeast, africa, cushitic, speaking, peoples, had, migrated, into, the, region, from, the, ethiopian, highlands, and, other, more, northerly, areas, the, first, waves, consisted, of, southern, cushitic, speakers, who, settled, around, lake, turkana, and, parts, of, tanzania, beginning, around, 5, 000, years, ago, many, centuries, later, around, ad, 1000, some, eastern, cushitic, speakers, also, settled, in, northern, and, coastal, kenya, khoisan, speaking, hunter, gatherers, also, inhabited, southeast, africa, before, the, bantu, expansion, nilo, saharan, speaking, herder, populations, comprised, a, third, group, of, the, area, s, pre, bantu, expansion, inhabitants, linguistic, archeological, and, genetic, evidence, indicates, that, during, the, course, of, the, bantu, expansion, independent, waves, of, migration, of, western, african, and, east, african, bantu, speakers, into, southern, africa, occurred, in, some, places, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, bantu, language, expansion, was, largely, a, result, of, substantial, population, replacement, in, other, places, bantu, language, expansion, like, many, other, languages, has, been, documented, with, population, genetic, evidence, to, have, occurred, by, means, other, than, complete, or, predominant, population, replacement, e, g, via, language, shift, and, admixture, of, incoming, and, existing, populations, for, example, one, study, found, this, to, be, the, case, in, bantu, language, speakers, who, are, african, pygmies, or, are, in, mozambique, while, another, population, genetic, study, found, this, to, be, the, case, in, the, bantu, language, speaking, lemba, of, southern, africa, where, bantu, was, adopted, via, language, shift, of, existing, populations, prior, african, languages, were, spoken, probably, from, african, language, families, that, are, now, lost, except, as, substrate, influences, of, local, bantu, languages, such, as, click, sounds, in, local, bantu, languages, it, seems, likely, that, the, expansion, of, the, bantu, speaking, people, from, their, core, region, in, west, africa, began, around, 4000, 3500, bc, although, early, models, posited, that, the, early, speakers, were, both, iron, using, and, agricultural, definitive, archaeological, evidence, that, they, used, iron, does, not, appear, until, as, late, as, 400, bc, though, they, were, agricultural, the, western, branch, not, necessarily, linguistically, distinct, according, to, christopher, ehret, followed, the, coast, and, the, major, rivers, of, the, congo, system, southward, reaching, central, angola, by, around, 500, bc, it, is, clear, that, there, were, human, populations, in, the, region, at, the, time, of, the, expansion, and, pygmies, are, their, closest, living, relatives, however, mtdna, genetic, research, from, cabinda, suggests, that, only, haplogroups, that, originated, in, west, africa, are, found, there, today, and, the, distinctive, l, 0, of, the, pre, bantu, population, is, missing, suggesting, that, there, was, a, complete, population, replacement, in, south, africa, however, a, more, complex, intermixing, could, have, taken, place, further, east, bantu, speaking, communities, had, reached, the, great, central, african, rainforest, and, by, 500, bc, pioneering, groups, had, emerged, into, the, savannas, to, the, south, in, what, are, now, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, angola, and, zambia, another, stream, of, migration, having, moved, east, by, 3, 000, years, ago, 1000, bc, was, creating, a, major, new, population, center, near, the, great, lakes, of, east, africa, where, a, rich, environment, supported, a, dense, population, the, urewe, culture, dominated, the, great, lakes, region, between, 650bc, and, 550bc, it, was, one, of, africa, s, oldest, iron, smelting, centres, by, the, first, century, bc, bantu, speaking, communities, in, the, great, lakes, region, developed, iron, forging, techniques, that, enabled, them, to, produce, carbon, steel, movements, by, small, groups, to, the, southeast, from, the, great, lakes, region, were, more, rapid, with, initial, settlements, widely, dispersed, near, the, coast, and, near, rivers, due, to, comparatively, difficult, farming, conditions, in, areas, farther, from, water, archaeological, findings, have, shown, that, by, 100, bc, to, 300, ad, bantu, speaking, communities, were, present, at, the, coastal, areas, of, misasa, in, tanzania, and, kwale, in, kenya, these, communities, also, integrated, and, intermarried, with, the, communities, already, present, at, the, coast, between, 300, ad, 1000, ad, through, participation, in, the, long, existing, indian, ocean, trade, route, these, communities, established, links, with, arabian, and, indian, traders, leading, to, the, development, of, the, swahili, culture, other, pioneering, groups, had, reached, modern, kwazulu, natal, in, south, africa, by, ad, 300, along, the, coast, and, the, modern, limpopo, province, formerly, northern, transvaal, by, ad, 500, between, the, 11th, and, 16th, centuries, powerful, bantu, speaking, states, on, a, scale, larger, than, local, chiefdoms, began, to, emerge, notable, early, kingdoms, include, the, kingdom, of, the, kongo, in, present, day, angola, and, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, the, bunyoro, kitara, kingdom, in, the, great, lakes, region, the, kingdom, of, mapungubwe, c, 1075, c, 1220, in, present, day, south, africa, and, the, zambezi, river, where, the, monomatapa, kings, built, the, great, zimbabwe, complex, the, swahili, city, states, were, also, established, early, in, this, period, these, include, sultanates, based, at, lamu, mombasa, kilwa, pate, and, malindi, the, swahili, traded, with, the, inland, kingdoms, including, great, zimbabwe, such, processes, of, state, formation, occurred, with, increasing, frequency, from, the, 16th, century, onward, they, likely, resulted, from, denser, population, which, led, to, more, specialised, divisions, of, labour, including, military, power, while, making, outmigration, more, effortful, other, factors, promoting, state, formation, were, increased, trade, among, african, communities, and, with, european, and, arab, traders, on, the, coasts, technological, innovations, in, economic, activity, and, new, techniques, in, the, political, spiritual, ritualisation, of, royalty, as, the, source, of, national, strength, and, health, other, inland, centres, established, during, this, phase, of, expansion, include, bigo, bya, mugenyi, in, uganda, thimlich, ohinga, in, kenya, and, the, kweneng, ruins, in, south, africa, manfred, k, h, eggert, stated, that, the, current, archaeological, record, in, the, central, african, rainforest, is, extremely, spotty, and, consequently, far, from, convincing, so, as, to, be, taken, as, a, reflection, of, a, steady, influx, of, bantu, speakers, into, the, forest, let, alone, movement, on, a, larger, scale, seidensticker, 2024, indicates, that, the, prevalent, paradigm, for, the, bantu, expansion, has, a, forced, connection, between, central, african, ceramics, and, central, african, languages, where, the, geographic, location, of, speakers, of, the, bantu, languages, are, treated, as, synonymous, with, the, geographic, location, of, ceramic, remnants, the, popular, approach, of, attempting, to, correlate, linguistic, reconstructions, with, archaeological, data, has, resulted, in, propagation, of, the, faulty, presumption, and, circular, reasoning, that, the, earliest, ceramic, manufacturing, in, a, given, area, is, evidence, for, the, earliest, presence, of, bantu, speakers, within, the, fierce, debate, among, linguists, about, the, word, bantu, seidensticker, 2024, indicates, that, there, has, been, a, profound, conceptual, trend, in, which, a, purely, technical, without, any, non, linguistic, connotations, was, transformed, into, a, designation, referring, indiscriminately, to, language, culture, society, and, race
