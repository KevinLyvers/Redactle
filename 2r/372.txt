and, one, of, the, first, joint, stock, companies, in, the, world, established, on, 20, march, 1602, by, the, states, general, of, the, netherlands, amalgamating, existing, companies, it, was, granted, a, 21, year, monopoly, to, carry, out, trade, activities, in, asia, shares, in, the, company, could, be, purchased, by, any, citizen, of, the, united, provinces, dutch, republic, and, subsequently, bought, and, sold, in, open, air, secondary, markets, one, of, which, became, the, amsterdam, stock, exchange, the, company, possessed, quasi, governmental, powers, including, the, ability, to, wage, war, imprison, and, execute, convicts, negotiate, treaties, strike, its, own, coins, and, establish, colonies, also, because, it, traded, across, multiple, colonies, and, countries, from, both, the, east, and, the, west, the, voc, is, sometimes, considered, to, have, been, the, world, s, first, multinational, corporation, statistically, the, voc, eclipsed, all, of, its, rivals, in, the, asian, trade, between, 1602, and, 1796, the, voc, sent, nearly, a, million, europeans, to, work, in, the, asia, trade, on, 4, 785, ships, and, netted, for, their, efforts, more, than, 2, 5, million, tons, of, asian, trade, goods, and, slaves, by, contrast, the, rest, of, europe, combined, sent, only, 882, 412, people, from, 1500, to, 1795, and, the, fleet, of, the, english, later, british, east, india, company, the, voc, s, nearest, competitor, was, a, distant, second, to, its, total, traffic, with, 2, 690, ships, and, a, mere, one, fifth, the, tonnage, of, goods, carried, by, the, voc, the, voc, enjoyed, huge, profits, from, its, spice, monopoly, and, slave, trading, activities, through, most, of, the, 17th, century, having, been, set, up, in, 1602, to, profit, from, the, malukan, spice, trade, the, voc, established, a, capital, in, the, port, city, of, jayakarta, in, 1619, and, changed, its, name, to, batavia, now, jakarta, over, the, next, two, centuries, the, company, acquired, additional, ports, as, trading, bases, and, safeguarded, their, interests, by, taking, over, surrounding, territory, it, remained, an, important, trading, concern, and, paid, annual, dividends, that, averaged, to, about, 18, of, the, capital, for, almost, 200, years, much, of, the, labor, that, built, its, colonies, was, from, people, it, had, enslaved, weighed, down, by, smuggling, corruption, and, growing, administrative, costs, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, company, went, bankrupt, and, was, formally, dissolved, in, 1799, its, possessions, and, debt, were, taken, over, by, the, government, of, the, dutch, batavian, republic, in, dutch, the, name, of, the, company, was, the, vereenigde, nederlandsche, geoctroyeerde, oostindische, compagnie, abbreviated, as, the, voc, literally, the, united, dutch, chartered, east, india, company, the, united, east, india, company, the, company, s, monogram, logo, consisted, of, a, large, capital, v, with, an, o, on, the, left, and, a, c, on, the, right, half, and, was, possibly, the, first, globally, recognised, corporate, logo, it, appeared, on, various, corporate, items, such, as, cannons, and, coins, the, first, letter, of, the, hometown, of, the, chamber, conducting, the, operation, was, placed, on, top, the, monogram, versatility, flexibility, clarity, simplicity, symmetry, timelessness, and, symbolism, are, considered, notable, characteristics, of, the, voc, s, professionally, designed, logo, those, elements, ensured, its, success, at, a, time, when, the, concept, of, the, corporate, identity, was, virtually, unknown, an, australian, vintner, has, used, the, voc, logo, since, the, late, 20th, century, having, re, registered, the, company, s, name, for, the, purpose, around, the, world, and, especially, in, english, speaking, countries, the, voc, is, widely, known, as, the, dutch, east, india, company, the, name, dutch, east, india, company, is, used, to, make, a, distinction, from, the, east, india, company, eic, and, other, east, indian, companies, such, as, the, danish, east, india, company, french, east, india, company, portuguese, east, india, company, and, the, swedish, east, india, company, the, company, s, alternative, names, that, have, been, used, include, the, dutch, east, indies, company, united, east, india, company, jan, company, or, jan, compagnie, before, the, dutch, revolt, which, began, in, 1566, 68, the, flemish, city, of, antwerp, had, played, an, important, role, as, a, distribution, center, in, northern, europe, after, 1591, the, portuguese, used, an, international, syndicate, of, the, german, fugger, family, and, welser, family, as, well, as, spanish, and, italian, firms, which, operated, out, of, hamburg, as, the, northern, staple, port, to, distribute, their, goods, thereby, cutting, dutch, merchants, out, of, the, trade, at, the, same, time, the, portuguese, trade, system, was, unable, to, increase, supply, to, satisfy, growing, demand, in, particular, the, demand, for, pepper, demand, for, spices, was, relatively, inelastic, therefore, each, lag, in, the, supply, of, pepper, caused, a, sharp, rise, in, pepper, prices, in, 1580, the, portuguese, crown, was, united, in, a, personal, union, with, the, spanish, crown, known, as, the, iberian, union, with, which, the, dutch, republic, was, at, war, the, portuguese, empire, thus, became, an, appropriate, target, for, dutch, military, incursions, these, factors, motivated, dutch, merchants, to, enter, the, intercontinental, spice, trade, themselves, further, a, number, of, dutch, merchants, and, explorers, such, as, jan, huyghen, van, linschoten, and, cornelis, de, houtman, went, on, to, obtain, firsthand, knowledge, of, the, secret, portuguese, trade, routes, and, practices, that, were, already, in, place, thereby, providing, further, opportunity, for, the, dutch, to, enter, the, trade, the, stage, was, thus, set, for, dutch, expeditions, to, the, indonesian, islands, beginning, with, james, lancaster, in, 1591, cornelis, de, houtman, in, 1595, and, again, in, 1598, jacob, van, neck, in, 1598, lancaster, again, in, 1601, among, others, during, the, four, ship, exploratory, expedition, by, frederick, de, houtman, in, 1595, to, banten, the, main, pepper, port, of, west, java, the, crew, clashed, with, both, portuguese, and, indigenous, javanese, houtman, s, expedition, then, sailed, east, along, the, north, coast, of, java, losing, twelve, crew, members, to, a, javanese, attack, at, sidayu, and, killing, a, local, ruler, in, madura, half, the, crew, were, lost, before, the, expedition, made, it, back, to, the, netherlands, the, following, year, but, with, enough, spices, to, make, a, considerable, profit, in, 1598, an, increasing, number, of, fleets, were, sent, out, by, competing, merchant, groups, from, around, the, netherlands, some, fleets, were, lost, but, most, were, successful, with, some, voyages, producing, high, profits, in, 1598, a, fleet, of, eight, ships, under, jacob, van, neck, had, been, the, first, dutch, fleet, to, reach, the, spice, islands, of, maluku, also, known, as, the, moluccas, cutting, out, the, javanese, middlemen, the, ships, returned, to, europe, in, 1599, and, 1600, and, the, expedition, made, a, 400, percent, profit, in, 1600, the, dutch, joined, forces, with, the, muslim, hituese, on, ambon, island, in, an, anti, portuguese, alliance, in, return, for, which, the, dutch, were, given, the, sole, right, to, purchase, spices, from, hitu, dutch, control, of, ambon, was, achieved, when, the, portuguese, surrendered, their, fort, in, ambon, to, the, dutch, hituese, alliance, in, 1613, the, dutch, expelled, the, portuguese, from, their, solor, fort, but, a, subsequent, portuguese, attack, led, to, a, second, change, of, hands, following, this, second, reoccupation, the, dutch, once, again, captured, solor, in, 1636, east, of, solor, on, the, island, of, timor, dutch, advances, were, halted, by, an, autonomous, and, powerful, group, of, portuguese, eurasians, called, the, topasses, they, remained, in, control, of, the, sandalwood, trade, and, their, resistance, lasted, throughout, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, causing, portuguese, timor, to, remain, under, the, portuguese, sphere, of, control, at, the, time, it, was, customary, for, a, company, to, be, funded, only, for, the, duration, of, a, single, voyage, and, to, be, liquidated, upon, the, return, of, the, fleet, investment, in, these, expeditions, was, a, very, high, risk, venture, not, only, because, of, the, usual, dangers, of, piracy, disease, and, shipwreck, but, also, because, the, interplay, of, inelastic, demand, and, relatively, elastic, supply, of, spices, could, make, prices, tumble, thereby, ruining, prospects, of, profitability, to, manage, such, risk, the, forming, of, a, cartel, to, control, supply, would, seem, logical, in, 1600, the, english, were, the, first, to, adopt, this, approach, by, bundling, their, resources, into, a, monopoly, enterprise, the, english, east, india, company, thereby, threatening, their, dutch, competitors, with, ruin, in, 1602, the, dutch, government, followed, suit, sponsoring, the, creation, of, a, single, united, east, indies, company, that, was, also, granted, monopoly, over, the, asian, trade, for, a, time, in, the, seventeenth, century, it, was, able, to, monopolise, the, trade, in, nutmeg, mace, and, cloves, and, to, sell, these, spices, across, european, kingdoms, and, emperor, akbar, the, great, s, mughal, empire, at, 14, 17, times, the, price, it, paid, in, indonesia, while, dutch, profits, soared, the, local, economy, of, the, spice, islands, was, destroyed, because, as, a, monopoly, buyer, the, voc, forced, the, prices, paid, to, the, local, producers, in, the, spice, islands, down, to, low, levels, with, a, capital, of, 6, 440, 200, guilders, the, new, company, s, charter, empowered, it, to, build, forts, maintain, armies, and, conclude, treaties, with, asian, rulers, it, provided, for, a, venture, that, would, continue, for, 21, years, with, a, financial, accounting, only, at, the, end, of, each, decade, in, february, 1603, the, company, seized, the, santa, catarina, a, 1500, ton, portuguese, merchant, carrack, off, the, coast, of, singapore, she, was, such, a, rich, prize, that, her, sale, proceeds, increased, the, capital, of, the, voc, by, more, than, 50, also, in, 1603, the, first, permanent, dutch, trading, post, in, indonesia, was, established, in, banten, west, java, and, in, 1611, another, was, established, at, jayakarta, later, batavia, and, then, jakarta, in, 1610, the, voc, established, the, post, of, governor, general, to, more, firmly, control, their, affairs, in, asia, to, advise, and, control, the, risk, of, despotic, governors, general, a, council, of, the, indies, raad, van, indi, was, created, the, governor, general, effectively, became, the, main, administrator, of, the, voc, s, activities, in, asia, although, the, heeren, xvii, a, body, of, 17, shareholders, representing, different, chambers, continued, to, officially, have, overall, control, voc, headquarters, were, located, in, ambon, during, the, tenures, of, the, first, three, governors, general, 1610, 1619, but, it, was, not, a, satisfactory, location, although, it, was, at, the, centre, of, the, spice, production, areas, it, was, far, from, the, asian, trade, routes, and, other, voc, areas, of, activity, ranging, from, africa, to, india, to, japan, a, location, in, the, west, of, the, archipelago, was, thus, sought, the, straits, of, malacca, were, strategic, but, became, dangerous, following, the, portuguese, conquest, and, the, first, permanent, voc, settlement, in, banten, was, controlled, by, a, powerful, local, ruler, and, subject, to, stiff, competition, from, chinese, and, english, traders, in, 1604, a, second, english, east, india, company, voyage, commanded, by, sir, henry, middleton, reached, the, islands, of, ternate, tidore, ambon, and, banda, in, banda, they, encountered, severe, voc, hostility, sparking, anglo, dutch, competition, for, access, to, spices, from, 1611, to, 1617, the, english, established, trading, posts, at, sukadana, southwest, kalimantan, makassar, jayakarta, and, jepara, in, java, and, aceh, pariaman, and, jambi, in, sumatra, which, threatened, dutch, ambitions, for, a, monopoly, on, east, indies, trade, in, 1620, diplomatic, agreements, in, europe, ushered, in, a, period, of, collaboration, between, the, dutch, and, english, spice, trades, this, ended, with, the, notorious, amboyna, massacre, where, ten, englishmen, were, arrested, tried, and, beheaded, for, conspiracy, against, the, dutch, government, although, this, caused, outrage, in, europe, and, a, diplomatic, crisis, the, english, quietly, withdrew, from, most, of, their, indonesian, activities, except, trading, in, banten, and, focused, on, other, asian, interests, in, 1619, jan, pieterszoon, coen, was, appointed, governor, general, of, the, voc, he, saw, the, possibility, of, the, voc, becoming, an, asian, power, both, political, and, economic, on, 30, may, 1619, coen, backed, by, a, force, of, nineteen, ships, stormed, jayakarta, driving, out, the, banten, forces, and, from, the, ashes, established, batavia, as, the, voc, headquarters, in, the, 1620s, almost, the, entire, native, population, of, the, banda, islands, was, driven, away, starved, to, death, or, killed, in, an, attempt, to, replace, them, with, dutch, plantations, these, plantations, were, used, to, grow, nutmeg, for, export, coen, hoped, to, settle, large, numbers, of, dutch, colonists, in, the, east, indies, but, implementation, of, this, policy, never, materialised, mainly, because, very, few, dutch, were, willing, to, emigrate, to, asia, another, of, coen, s, ventures, was, more, successful, a, major, problem, in, the, european, trade, with, asia, at, the, time, was, that, the, europeans, could, offer, few, goods, that, asian, consumers, wanted, except, silver, and, gold, european, traders, therefore, had, to, pay, for, spices, with, the, precious, metals, which, were, in, short, supply, in, europe, except, for, spain, and, portugal, the, dutch, and, english, had, to, obtain, it, by, creating, a, trade, surplus, with, other, european, countries, coen, discovered, the, obvious, solution, for, the, problem, to, start, an, intra, asiatic, trade, system, whose, profits, could, be, used, to, finance, the, spice, trade, with, europe, in, the, long, run, this, obviated, the, need, for, exports, of, precious, metals, from, europe, though, at, first, it, required, the, formation, of, a, large, trading, capital, fund, in, the, indies, the, voc, reinvested, a, large, share, of, its, profits, to, this, end, in, the, period, up, to, 1630, the, voc, traded, throughout, asia, benefiting, mainly, from, bengal, ships, coming, into, batavia, from, the, netherlands, carried, supplies, for, voc, settlements, in, asia, silver, and, copper, from, japan, were, used, to, trade, with, the, world, s, wealthiest, empires, mughal, india, and, qing, china, for, silk, cotton, porcelain, and, textiles, these, products, were, either, traded, within, asia, for, the, coveted, spices, or, brought, back, to, europe, the, voc, was, also, instrumental, in, introducing, european, ideas, and, technology, to, asia, the, company, supported, christian, missionaries, and, traded, modern, technology, with, china, and, japan, a, more, peaceful, voc, trade, post, on, dejima, an, artificial, island, off, the, coast, of, nagasaki, was, for, more, than, two, hundred, years, the, only, place, where, europeans, were, permitted, to, trade, with, japan, when, the, voc, tried, to, use, military, force, to, make, ming, dynasty, china, open, up, to, dutch, trade, the, chinese, defeated, the, dutch, in, a, war, over, the, penghu, islands, from, 1623, to, 1624, forcing, the, voc, to, abandon, penghu, for, taiwan, the, chinese, defeated, the, voc, again, at, the, battle, of, liaoluo, bay, in, 1633, the, vietnamese, nguyen, lords, defeated, the, voc, in, a, 1643, battle, during, the, tr, nh, nguy, n, war, blowing, up, a, dutch, ship, the, cambodians, defeated, the, voc, in, the, cambodian, dutch, war, from, 1643, to, 1644, on, the, mekong, river, in, 1640, the, voc, obtained, the, port, of, galle, ceylon, from, the, portuguese, and, broke, the, latter, s, monopoly, of, the, cinnamon, trade, in, 1658, gerard, pietersz, hulft, laid, siege, to, colombo, which, was, captured, with, the, help, of, king, rajasinghe, ii, of, kandy, by, 1659, the, portuguese, had, been, expelled, from, the, coastal, regions, which, were, then, occupied, by, the, voc, securing, for, it, the, monopoly, over, cinnamon, to, prevent, the, portuguese, or, the, english, from, ever, recapturing, sri, lanka, the, voc, went, on, to, conquer, the, entire, malabar, coast, from, the, portuguese, almost, entirely, driving, them, from, the, west, coast, of, india, in, 1652, jan, van, riebeeck, established, a, resupply, outpost, at, the, cape, of, storms, the, southwestern, tip, of, africa, now, cape, town, south, africa, to, service, company, ships, on, their, journey, to, and, from, east, asia, the, cape, was, later, renamed, cape, of, good, hope, in, honour, of, the, outpost, s, presence, although, non, company, ships, were, welcome, to, use, the, station, they, were, charged, exorbitantly, this, post, later, became, a, full, fledged, colony, the, cape, colony, when, more, dutch, and, other, europeans, started, to, settle, there, through, the, seventeenth, century, voc, trading, posts, were, also, established, in, persia, bengal, malacca, siam, formosa, now, taiwan, as, well, as, the, malabar, and, coromandel, coasts, in, india, direct, access, to, mainland, china, came, in, 1729, when, a, factory, was, established, in, canton, in, 1662, however, koxinga, expelled, the, dutch, from, taiwan, see, history, of, taiwan, in, 1663, the, voc, signed, the, painan, treaty, with, several, local, lords, in, the, painan, area, that, were, revolting, against, the, aceh, sultanate, the, treaty, allowed, the, voc, to, build, a, trading, post, in, the, area, and, eventually, to, monopolise, the, trade, there, especially, the, gold, trade, by, 1669, the, voc, was, the, richest, private, company, the, world, had, ever, seen, with, over, 150, merchant, ships, 40, warships, 50, 000, employees, a, private, army, of, 10, 000, soldiers, and, a, dividend, payment, of, 40, on, the, original, investment, many, of, the, voc, employees, inter, mixed, with, the, indigenous, peoples, and, expanded, the, population, of, indos, in, pre, colonial, history, around, 1670, two, events, caused, the, growth, of, voc, trade, to, stall, in, the, first, place, the, highly, profitable, trade, with, japan, started, to, decline, the, loss, of, the, outpost, on, formosa, to, koxinga, in, the, 1662, siege, of, fort, zeelandia, and, related, internal, turmoil, in, china, where, the, ming, dynasty, was, being, replaced, with, the, china, s, qing, dynasty, brought, an, end, to, the, silk, trade, after, 1666, though, the, voc, substituted, mughal, bengal, s, for, chinese, silk, other, forces, affected, the, supply, of, japanese, silver, and, gold, the, shogunate, enacted, a, number, of, measures, to, limit, the, export, of, these, precious, metals, in, the, process, limiting, voc, opportunities, for, trade, and, severely, worsening, the, terms, of, trade, therefore, japan, ceased, to, function, as, the, linchpin, of, the, intra, asiatic, trade, of, the, voc, by, 1685, even, more, importantly, the, third, anglo, dutch, war, temporarily, interrupted, voc, trade, with, europe, this, caused, a, spike, in, the, price, of, pepper, which, enticed, the, english, east, india, company, eic, to, enter, this, market, aggressively, in, the, years, after, 1672, previously, one, of, the, tenets, of, the, voc, pricing, policy, was, to, slightly, over, supply, the, pepper, market, so, as, to, depress, prices, below, the, level, where, interlopers, were, encouraged, to, enter, the, market, instead, of, striving, for, short, term, profit, maximisation, the, wisdom, of, such, a, policy, was, illustrated, when, a, fierce, price, war, with, the, eic, ensued, as, that, company, flooded, the, market, with, new, supplies, from, india, in, this, struggle, for, market, share, the, voc, which, had, much, larger, financial, resources, could, wait, out, the, eic, indeed, by, 1683, the, latter, came, close, to, bankruptcy, its, share, price, plummeted, from, 600, to, 250, and, its, president, josiah, child, was, temporarily, forced, from, office, however, the, writing, was, on, the, wall, other, companies, like, the, french, east, india, company, and, the, danish, east, india, company, also, started, to, make, inroads, on, the, dutch, system, the, voc, therefore, closed, the, theretofore, flourishing, open, pepper, emporium, of, bantam, by, a, treaty, of, 1684, with, the, sultan, also, on, the, coromandel, coast, it, moved, its, chief, stronghold, from, pulicat, to, nagapattinam, so, as, to, secure, a, monopoly, on, the, pepper, trade, to, the, detriment, of, the, french, and, the, danes, however, the, importance, of, these, traditional, commodities, in, the, asian, european, trade, was, diminishing, rapidly, at, the, time, the, military, outlays, that, the, voc, needed, to, make, to, enhance, its, monopoly, were, not, justified, by, the, increased, profits, of, this, declining, trade, nevertheless, this, lesson, was, slow, to, sink, in, and, at, first, the, voc, made, the, strategic, decision, to, improve, its, military, position, on, the, malabar, coast, hoping, thereby, to, curtail, english, influence, in, the, area, and, end, the, drain, on, its, resources, from, the, cost, of, the, malabar, garrisons, by, using, force, to, compel, the, zamorin, of, calicut, to, submit, to, dutch, domination, in, 1710, the, zamorin, was, made, to, sign, a, treaty, with, the, voc, undertaking, to, trade, exclusively, with, the, voc, and, expel, other, european, traders, for, a, brief, time, this, appeared, to, improve, the, company, s, prospects, however, in, 1715, with, eic, encouragement, the, zamorin, renounced, the, treaty, though, a, dutch, army, managed, to, suppress, this, insurrection, temporarily, the, zamorin, continued, to, trade, with, the, english, and, the, french, which, led, to, an, appreciable, upsurge, in, english, and, french, traffic, the, voc, decided, in, 1721, that, it, was, no, longer, worth, the, trouble, to, try, to, dominate, the, malabar, pepper, and, spice, trade, a, strategic, decision, was, taken, to, scale, down, the, dutch, military, presence, and, in, effect, yield, the, area, to, eic, influence, in, the, 1741, battle, of, colachel, warriors, of, travancore, under, raja, marthanda, varma, defeated, the, dutch, the, dutch, commander, captain, eustachius, de, lannoy, was, captured, marthanda, varma, agreed, to, spare, the, dutch, captain, s, life, on, condition, that, he, joined, his, army, and, trained, his, soldiers, on, modern, lines, this, defeat, in, the, travancore, dutch, war, is, considered, the, earliest, example, of, an, organised, asian, power, overcoming, european, military, technology, and, tactics, and, it, signalled, the, decline, of, dutch, power, in, india, the, attempt, to, continue, as, before, as, a, low, volume, high, profit, business, enterprise, with, its, core, business, in, the, spice, trade, had, therefore, failed, the, company, had, however, already, reluctantly, followed, the, example, of, its, european, competitors, in, diversifying, into, other, asian, commodities, like, tea, coffee, cotton, textiles, and, sugar, these, commodities, provided, a, lower, profit, margin, and, therefore, required, a, larger, sales, volume, to, generate, the, same, amount, of, revenue, this, structural, change, in, the, commodity, composition, of, the, voc, s, trade, started, in, the, early, 1680s, after, the, temporary, collapse, of, the, eic, around, 1683, offered, an, excellent, opportunity, to, enter, these, markets, the, actual, cause, for, the, change, lies, however, in, two, structural, features, of, this, new, era, in, the, first, place, there, was, a, revolutionary, change, in, the, tastes, affecting, european, demand, for, asian, textiles, coffee, and, tea, around, the, turn, of, the, 18th, century, secondly, a, new, era, of, an, abundant, supply, of, capital, at, low, interest, rates, suddenly, opened, around, this, time, the, second, factor, enabled, the, company, easily, to, finance, its, expansion, in, the, new, areas, of, commerce, between, the, 1680s, and, 1720s, the, voc, was, therefore, able, to, equip, and, man, an, appreciable, expansion, of, its, fleet, and, acquire, a, large, amount, of, precious, metals, to, finance, the, purchase, of, large, amounts, of, asian, commodities, for, shipment, to, europe, the, overall, effect, was, approximately, to, double, the, size, of, the, company, the, tonnage, of, the, returning, ships, rose, by, 125, percent, in, this, period, however, the, company, s, revenues, from, the, sale, of, goods, landed, in, europe, rose, by, only, 78, percent, this, reflects, the, basic, change, in, the, voc, s, circumstances, that, had, occurred, it, now, operated, in, new, markets, for, goods, with, an, elastic, demand, in, which, it, had, to, compete, on, an, equal, footing, with, other, suppliers, this, made, for, low, profit, margins, the, business, information, systems, of, the, time, made, this, difficult, to, discern, for, the, managers, of, the, company, which, may, partly, explain, the, mistakes, they, made, from, hindsight, this, lack, of, information, might, have, been, counteracted, as, in, earlier, times, in, the, voc, s, history, by, the, business, acumen, of, the, directors, by, this, time, these, were, almost, exclusively, recruited, from, the, political, regent, class, which, had, long, since, lost, its, close, relationship, with, merchant, circles, low, profit, margins, in, themselves, do, not, explain, the, deterioration, of, revenues, to, a, large, extent, the, costs, of, the, operation, of, the, voc, had, a, fixed, character, military, establishments, maintenance, of, the, fleet, and, such, profit, levels, might, therefore, have, been, maintained, if, the, increase, in, the, scale, of, trading, operations, that, in, fact, took, place, had, resulted, in, economies, of, scale, however, though, larger, ships, transported, the, growing, volume, of, goods, labour, productivity, did, not, go, up, sufficiently, to, realise, these, in, general, the, company, s, overhead, rose, in, step, with, the, growth, in, trade, volume, declining, gross, margins, translated, directly, into, a, decline, in, profitability, of, the, invested, capital, the, era, of, expansion, was, one, of, profitless, growth, specifically, he, long, term, average, annual, profit, in, the, voc, s, 1630, 70, golden, age, was, 2, 1, million, guilders, of, which, just, under, half, was, distributed, as, dividends, and, the, remainder, reinvested, the, long, term, average, annual, profit, in, the, expansion, age, 1680, 1730, was, 2, 0, million, guilders, of, which, three, quarters, was, distributed, as, dividend, and, one, quarter, reinvested, in, the, earlier, period, profits, averaged, 18, percent, of, total, revenues, in, the, latter, period, 10, percent, the, annual, return, of, invested, capital, in, the, earlier, period, stood, at, approximately, 6, percent, in, the, latter, period, 3, 4, percent, nevertheless, in, the, eyes, of, investors, the, voc, did, not, do, too, badly, the, share, price, hovered, consistently, around, the, 400, mark, from, the, mid, 1680s, excepting, a, hiccup, around, the, glorious, revolution, in, 1688, and, they, reached, an, all, time, high, of, around, 642, in, the, 1720s, voc, shares, then, yielded, a, return, of, 3, 5, percent, only, slightly, less, than, the, yield, on, dutch, government, bonds, after, 1730, the, fortunes, of, the, voc, started, to, decline, five, major, contributing, factors, are, attributed, to, its, decay, in, the, 50, years, between, 1730, and, 1780, despite, these, problems, the, voc, in, 1780, remained, an, enormous, operation, its, capital, in, the, republic, consisting, of, ships, and, goods, in, inventory, totalled, 28, million, guilders, its, capital, in, asia, consisting, of, the, liquid, trading, fund, and, goods, en, route, to, europe, totalled, 46, million, guilders, total, capital, net, of, outstanding, debt, stood, at, 62, million, guilders, the, prospects, of, the, company, at, this, time, therefore, were, not, hopeless, had, one, of, the, plans, for, reform, been, undertaken, successfully, however, the, fourth, anglo, dutch, war, intervened, british, naval, attacks, in, europe, and, asia, reduced, the, voc, fleet, by, half, removed, valuable, cargo, from, its, control, and, eroded, its, remaining, power, in, asia, the, direct, losses, of, the, voc, during, the, war, can, be, calculated, at, 43, million, guilders, loans, to, keep, the, company, operating, reduced, its, net, assets, to, zero, from, 1720, on, the, market, for, sugar, from, indonesia, declined, as, the, competition, from, cheap, sugar, from, brazil, increased, european, markets, became, saturated, dozens, of, chinese, sugar, traders, went, bankrupt, which, led, to, massive, unemployment, which, in, turn, led, to, gangs, of, unemployed, coolies, the, dutch, government, in, batavia, did, not, adequately, respond, to, these, problems, in, 1740, rumours, of, deportation, of, the, gangs, from, the, batavia, area, led, to, widespread, rioting, the, dutch, military, searched, houses, of, chinese, in, batavia, for, weapons, when, a, house, accidentally, burnt, down, military, and, impoverished, citizens, started, slaughtering, and, pillaging, the, chinese, community, this, massacre, of, the, chinese, was, deemed, sufficiently, serious, for, the, board, of, the, voc, to, start, an, official, investigation, into, the, government, of, the, dutch, east, indies, for, the, first, time, in, its, history, after, the, fourth, anglo, dutch, war, the, voc, s, financial, issues, worsened, considerably, after, vain, attempts, at, reorganisation, by, the, provincial, states, of, holland, and, zeeland, the, board, of, directors, in, the, voc, were, sacked, in, 1796, and, the, company, s, management, was, handed, over, to, a, committee, for, affairs, relating, to, east, india, trade, and, possessions, dutch, comit, tot, de, zaken, van, de, oost, indische, handel, en, bezittingen, the, voc, charter, was, renewed, several, times, but, was, allowed, to, expire, on, 31, december, 1799, most, of, the, possessions, of, the, former, voc, were, subsequently, occupied, by, great, britain, during, the, napoleonic, wars, but, after, the, new, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, was, created, by, the, congress, of, vienna, some, of, these, were, restored, to, this, successor, state, of, the, dutch, republic, by, the, anglo, dutch, treaty, of, 1814, while, the, voc, mainly, operated, in, what, later, became, the, dutch, east, indies, modern, indonesia, the, company, also, had, important, operations, elsewhere, it, employed, people, from, different, continents, and, origins, in, the, same, functions, and, working, environments, although, it, was, a, dutch, company, its, employees, included, not, only, people, from, the, netherlands, but, also, many, from, germany, and, other, countries, besides, the, diverse, north, west, european, workforce, recruited, by, the, voc, in, the, dutch, republic, the, voc, made, extensive, use, of, local, asian, labour, markets, as, a, result, the, personnel, of, the, various, voc, offices, in, asia, consisted, of, european, and, asian, employees, asian, or, eurasian, workers, could, be, employed, as, sailors, soldiers, writers, carpenters, smiths, or, as, simple, unskilled, workers, at, the, height, of, its, existence, the, voc, had, 25, 000, employees, who, worked, in, asia, and, 11, 000, who, were, en, route, also, while, most, of, its, shareholders, were, dutch, about, a, quarter, of, the, initial, shareholders, were, zuid, nederlanders, people, from, an, area, that, includes, modern, belgium, and, luxembourg, and, there, were, also, a, few, dozen, germans, the, voc, had, two, types, of, shareholders, the, participanten, who, could, be, seen, as, non, managing, members, and, the, 76, bewindhebbers, later, reduced, to, 60, who, acted, as, managing, directors, this, was, the, usual, set, up, for, dutch, joint, stock, companies, at, the, time, the, innovation, in, the, case, of, the, voc, was, that, the, liability, of, not, just, the, participanten, but, also, of, the, bewindhebbers, was, limited, to, the, paid, in, capital, usually, bewindhebbers, had, unlimited, liability, the, voc, therefore, was, a, limited, liability, company, also, the, capital, would, be, permanent, during, the, lifetime, of, the, company, as, a, consequence, investors, that, wished, to, liquidate, their, interest, in, the, interim, could, only, do, this, by, selling, their, share, to, others, on, the, amsterdam, stock, exchange, confusion, of, confusions, a, 1688, dialogue, by, the, sephardi, jew, joseph, de, la, vega, analysed, the, workings, of, this, one, stock, exchange, the, voc, consisted, of, six,

five, small, chambers, amsterdam, had, thereby, the, decisive, voice, the, zeelanders, in, particular, had, misgivings, about, this, arrangement, at, the, beginning, the, fear, was, not, unfounded, because, in, practice, it, meant, amsterdam, stipulated, what, happened, the, six, chambers, raised, the, start, up, capital, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, the, raising, of, capital, in, rotterdam, did, not, go, so, smoothly, a, considerable, part, originated, from, inhabitants, of, dordrecht, although, it, did, not, raise, as, much, capital, as, amsterdam, or, middelburg, zeeland, enkhuizen, had, the, largest, input, in, the, share, capital, of, the, voc, under, the, first, 358, shareholders, there, were, many, small, entrepreneurs, who, dared, to, take, the, risk, the,

history, s, first, recorded, investors, to, seriously, consider, the, problems, of, corporate, governance, isaac, le, maire, who, is, known, as, history, s, first, recorded, short, seller, was, also, a, sizeable, shareholder, of, the, voc, in, 1609, he, complained, of, the, voc, s, poor, corporate, governance, on, 24, january, 1609, le, maire, filed, a, petition, against, the, voc, marking, the, first, recorded, expression, of, shareholder, activism, in, what, is, the, first, recorded, corporate, governance, dispute, le, maire, formally, charged, that, the, voc, s, board, of, directors, the,

standard, business, practice, initially, the, largest, single, shareholder, in, the, voc, and, a, bewindhebber, sitting, on, the, board, of, governors, le, maire, apparently, attempted, to, divert, the, firm, s, profits, to, himself, by, undertaking, 14, expeditions, under, his, own, accounts, instead, of, those, of, the, company, since, his, large, shareholdings, were, not, accompanied, by, greater, voting, power, le, maire, was, soon, ousted, by, other, governors, in, 1605, on, charges, of, embezzlement, and, was, forced, to, sign, an, agreement, not, to, compete, with, the, voc, having, retained, stock, in, the, company, following, this, incident, in, 1609, le, maire, would, become, the, author, of, what, is, celebrated, as, first, recorded, expression, of, shareholder, advocacy, at, a, publicly, traded, company, in, 1622, the, history, s, first, recorded, shareholder, revolt, also, happened, among, the, voc, investors, who, complained, that, the, company, account,

think, the, voc, s, history, and, especially, its, dark, side, has, always, been, a, potential, source, of, controversy, in, 2006, when, the, dutch, prime, minister, jan, pieter, balkenende, referred, to, the, pioneering, entrepreneurial, spirit, and, work, ethics, of, the, dutch, people, and, dutch, republic, in, their, golden, age, he, coined, the, term, voc, mentality, voc, mentaliteit, in, dutch, for, balkenende, the, voc, represented, dutch, business, acumen, entrepreneurship, adventurous, spirit, and, decisiveness, however, it, unleashed, a, wave, of, criticism, since, such, romantic, views, about, the, dutch, golden, age, ignores, the, inherent, historical, associations, with, colonialism, exploitation, and, violence, balkenende, later, stressed, that, it, had, not, been, his, intention, to, refer, to, that, at, all, but, in, spite, of, criticisms, the, voc, mentality, as, a, characteristic, of, the, selective, historical, perspective, on, the, dutch, golden, age, has, been, considered, a, key, feature, of, dutch, cultural, policy, for, many, years, the, company, has, been, criticised, for, the, results, of, its, quasi, absolute, commercial, monopoly, colonialism, exploitation, including, use, of, slave, labour, slave, trade, use, of, violence, environmental, destruction, including, deforestation, and, for, its, overly, bureaucratic, organisational, structure, batavia, corresponding, to, present, day, jakarta, was, the, headquarters, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, and, had, a, strict, social, hierarchy, in, the, colony, according, to, marsely, l, kahoe, in, the, journal, of, historians, of, netherlandish, art, it, is, misleading, to, understand, batavia, as, some, scholars, have, as, representing, a, pragmatic, and, egalitarian, order, that, was, later, corrupted, by, the, colonial, situation, in, fact, the, social, stratification, and, segregation, of, batavia, derived, in, certain, ways, directly, from, its, dutch, plan, there, was, an, extraordinarily, high, mortality, rate, among, employees, of, the, voc, due, to, shipwrecks, illnesses, such, as, scurvy, and, dysentery, and, clashes, with, rival, trading, companies, and, pirates,

quasi, sovereign, state, and, engaged, in, brutal, conquests, one, example, is, the, dutch, conquest, of, the, banda, islands, between, 1609, and, 1621, after, the, islands, resisted, the, nutmeg, monopoly, the, dutch, launched, punitive, expeditions, that, resulted, in, the, near, destruction, of, bandanese, society, they, invaded, the, main, bandanese, island, of, lontor, in, 1621, 2, 800, bandanese, were, killed, mostly, from, famine, and, 1, 700, were, enslaved, during, the, attack, the, total, population, of, the, islands, was, estimated, at, 15, 000, people, before, the, conquest, although, the, exact, number, remains, uncertain, it, is, estimated, that, around, 14, 000, people, were, killed, enslaved, or, fled, elsewhere, with, only, 1, 000, bandanese, surviving, in, the, islands, and, were, spread, throughout, the, nutmeg, groves, as, forced, labourers, the, treatment, of, slaves, was, harsh, and, the, native, bandanese, population, dropped, to, 1, 000, by, 1681, 200, slaves, were, imported, annually, to, sustain, the, slave, population, at, a, total, of, 4, 000, by, the, time, the, settlement, was, established, at, the, cape, in, 1652, the, voc, already, had, a, long, experience, of, practicing, slavery, in, the, east, indies, jan, van, riebeeck, concluded, within, two, months, of, the, establishment, of, the, cape, settlement, that, slave, labor, would, be, needed, for, the, hardest, and, dirtiest, work, initially, the, voc, considered, enslaving, men, from, the, indigenous, khoikhoi, population, but, the, idea, was, rejected, on, the, grounds, that, such, a, policy, would, be, both, costly, and, dangerous, most, khoikhoi, had, chosen, not, to, labor, for, the, dutch, because, of, low, wages, and, harsh, conditions, in, the, beginning, the, settlers, traded, with, the, khoikhoi, but, the, harsh, working, conditions, and, low, wages, imposed, by, the, dutch, led, to, a, series, of, wars, the, european, population, remained, under, 200, during, the, settlement, s, first, five, years, and, war, against, neighbors, numbering, more, than, 20, 000, would, have, been, foolhardy, moreover, the, dutch, feared, that, khoikhoi, people, if, enslaved, could, always, escape, into, the, local, community, whereas, foreigners, would, find, it, much, more, difficult, to, escape, and, survive, or, avoid, recapture, between, 1652, and, 1657, a, number, of, unsuccessful, attempts, were, made, to, obtain, men, from, the, dutch, east, indies, and, from, mauritius, in, 1658, however, the, voc, landed, two, shiploads, of, slaves, at, the, cape, one, containing, more, than, 200, people, brought, from, dahomey, later, benin, the, second, with, almost, 200, people, most, of, them, children, captured, from, a, portuguese, slaver, off, the, coast, of, angola, except, for, a, few, individuals, these, were, to, be, the, only, slaves, ever, brought, to, the, cape, from, west, africa, from, 1658, to, the, end, of, the, company, s, rule, many, more, slaves, were, brought, regularly, to, the, cape, in, various, ways, chiefly, by, company, sponsored, slaving, voyages, and, slaves, brought, to, the, cape, by, its, return, fleets, from, these, sources, and, by, natural, growth, the, slave, population, increased, from, zero, in, 1652, to, about, 1, 000, by, 1700, during, the, 18th, century, the, slave, population, increased, dramatically, to, 16, 839, by, 1795, after, the, slave, trade, was, initiated, all, of, the, slaves, imported, into, the, cape, until, the, british, stopped, the, trade, in, 1807, were, from, east, africa, mozambique, madagascar, and, south, and, southeast, asia, large, numbers, were, brought, from, ceylon, and, the, indonesian, archipelago, prisoners, from, other, countries, in, the, voc, s, empire, were, also, enslaved, the, slave, population, which, exceeded, that, of, the, european, settlers, until, the, first, quarter, of, the, nineteenth, century, was, overwhelmingly, male, and, was, thus, dependent, on, constant, imports, of, new, slaves, to, maintain, and, to, augment, its, size, by, the, 1660s, the, cape, settlement, was, importing, slaves, from, ceylon, malaya, malaysia, and, madagascar, to, work, on, the, farms, conflict, between, dutch, farmers, and, khoikhoi, broke, out, once, it, became, clear, to, the, latter, that, the, dutch, were, there, to, stay, and, that, they, intended, to, encroach, on, the, lands, of, the, pastoralists, in, 1659, doman, a, khoikhoi, who, had, worked, as, a, translator, for, the, dutch, and, had, even, traveled, to, java, led, an, armed, attempt, to, expel, the, dutch, from, the, cape, peninsula, the, attempt, was, a, failure, although, warfare, dragged, on, until, an, inconclusive, peace, was, established, a, year, later, during, the, following, decade, pressure, on, the, khoikhoi, grew, as, more, of, the, dutch, became, free, burghers, expanded, their, landholdings, and, sought, pastureland, for, their, growing, herds, war, broke, out, again, in, 1673, and, continued, until, 1677, when, khoikhoi, resistance, was, destroyed, by, a, combination, of, superior, european, weapons, and, dutch, manipulation, of, divisions, among, the, local, people, thereafter, khoikhoi, society, in, the, western, cape, disintegrated, some, people, found, jobs, as, shepherds, on, european, farms, others, rejected, foreign, rule, and, moved, away, from, the, cape, the, final, blow, for, most, came, in, 1713, when, a, dutch, ship, brought, smallpox, to, the, cape, hitherto, unknown, locally, the, disease, ravaged, the, remaining,
