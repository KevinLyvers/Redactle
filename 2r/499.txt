and, a, small, group, of, radical, reformers, argued, that, iran, s, oil, industry, was, being, sold, to, the, british, while, tax, breaks, on, imports, exports, and, manufactured, textiles, were, destroying, iran, s, economy, which, had, been, supported, by, the, bazaar, merchants, and, that, the, shah, was, selling, assets, to, pay, interest, on, the, fortune, in, foreign, debt, he, had, accumulated, it, ended, in, december, 1911, when, deputies, of, the, second, majlis, suffering, from, internal, dissension, apathy, of, the, masses, antagonisms, from, the, upper, class, and, open, enmity, from, britain, and, russia, were, roughly, expelled, from, the, majlis, and, threatened, with, death, if, they, returned, by, the, shah, s, cabinet, backed, by, 12, 000, russian, troops, in,

signed, a, commercial, treaty, with, britain, the, lack, of, a, standing, iranian, army, was, part, of, the, problem, because, the, forces, that, were, raised, to, fight, the, russians, for, example, were, faction, ridden, tribal, contingents, and, lacked, modern, artillery, to, compensate, for, his, lack, of, an, army, the, qajar, shah, would, use, loyal, tribes, putting, down, a, rebellion, by, declaring, a, rebellious, city, or, region, open, booty, for, the, tribe, who, would, then, appear, to, rape, and, pillage, a, far, more, destructive, means, of, discipline, than, arresting, and, punishing, rebels, major, roads, between, cities, that, might, have, appeared, to, be, investments, in, improving, transportation, provided, opportunities, not, for, greater, trade, and, prosperity, but, for, tax, collectors, to, fleece, towns, along, the, road, and, thus, encouraged, the, local, peasants, to, settle, in, more, distant, regions, a, survey, for, the, british, foreign, office, reported, there, are, large, tracts, of, fertile, land, which, remain, waste, owing, to, their, proximity, to, the, main, roads, as, no, village, having, cultivators, on, such, spots, can, possibly, prosper, or, enjoy, the, least, immunity, from, the, pestering, visits, of, government, officials, and, thefts, and, robberies, committed, by, the, tribes, perhaps, worst, of, all, the, indignities, iran, suffered, from, the, superior, militaries, of, european, powers, were, a, series, of, commercial, capitulations, while, the, sales, by, the, shah, of, titles, patents, privileges, concessions, monopolies, lands, high, offices, paid, for, some, improvements, such, as, a, telegraph, network, and, in, tehran, a, regular, police, force, a, municipal, civil, service, etc, they, were, also,

and, opening, up, the, karun, river, to, navigation, nikki, r, keddie, points, out, that, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 05, and, the, russian, revolution, of, 1905, gave, impetus, to, an, iranian, opposition, movement, that, had, been, growing, since, 1901, after, a, century, of, successive, defeats, an, asian, power, had, defeated, a, european, power, an, event, that, bolstered, pride, throughout, asia, this, feeling, was, particularly, strong, in, those, countries, like, iran, that, had, experienced, russian, penetration, and, oppression, many, considered, it, significant, that, the, only, asian, power, with, a, constitution, had, defeated, the, only, western, power, without, one, and, constitutions, came, to, be, looked, upon, as, the, secret, of, strength, of, western, governments, the, political, base, of, the, constitutionalist, movement, to, control, the, power, of, the, shah, was, an, alliance, of, the, ulama, liberal, and, radical, intellectuals, and, the, bazaar, but, the, alliance, was, based, on, common, enemies, rather, than, common, goals, the, ulama, sought, to, extend, their, own, power, and, to, have, shi, i, islam, more, strictly, enforced, the, liberals, and, radicals, desired, greater, political, and, social, democracy, and, economic, development, and, the, bazaaris, to, restrict, favored, foreign, economic, status, and, competition, the, intellectuals, were, a, small, but, growing, group, many, of, whom, learned, of, western, ways, while, travelling, abroad, and, were, generally, struck, by, western, economic, development, comparative, justice, and, lack, of, arbitrary, rule, in, their, writings, these, intellectuals, criticized, iran, s, autocratic, rulers, petty, officials, venal, clerics, and, arbitrary, courts, and, of, the, low, status, of, women, the, mercantile, class, or, bazaari, became, convinced, that, law, and, order, security, of, property, and, immunity, from, arbitrary, power, could, all, be, achieved, by, importing, parliamentary, democracy, from, europe, the, ulama, i, e, islamic, scholars, had, less, to, gain, and, a, less, direct, incentive, to, support, a, constitution, but, were, convinced, at, least, for, a, time, that, their, hierocracy, vis, a, vis, the, monarchy, would, not, be, weakened, the, tobacco, protest, of, 1891, 1892, was, the, first, mass, nationwide, popular, movement, in, iran, and, described, as, a, dress, rehearsal, for, the, constitutional, revolution, formed, from, an, anti, imperialist, and, antimonarchist, coalition, of, clerics, mercantile,

in, foreign, markets, that, was, not, grown, elsewhere, and, the, arrangement, threatened, the, job, security, of, a, significant, portion, of, the, iranian, population, hundreds, of, thousands, of, workers, in, agriculture, and, the, bazaars, this, led, to, unprecedented, nationwide, protest, erupting, first, among, the, bazaari, and, then, the, ulama, in, december, 1891, the, most, important, religious, authority, in, iran, marja, e, taqlid, mirza, hasan, shirazi, issued, a, fatwa, declaring, the, use, of, tobacco, to, be, tantamount, to, war, against, the, hidden, imam, using, the,

said, to, be, less, likely, to, forego, than, bread, the, religious, ban, was, so, successful, that, it, was, said, that, women, in, the, shah, s, harem, quit, smoking, the, protest, demonstrated, to, the, iranians, for, the, first, time, that, it, was, possible, to, win, out, against, the, shah, and, foreign, interests, there, is, a, direct, line, from, the, coalition, which, participated, in,

the, law, of, the, prophet, and, have, set, up, their, own, law, instead, and, if, the, marja, religious, leader, that, a, shi, i, muslim, followed, supported, democracy, that, muslim, should, not, if, a, thousand, jurists, write, that, this, parliament, is, founded, on, the, command, to, do, good, and, prohibit, evil, then, you, are, witness, that, this, is, not, the, case, and, they, have,

that, the, constitution, is, against, sharia, law, all, oppositions, of, this, kind, are, in, vain, because, the, hujjaj, al, islam, of, the, atabat, who, are, today, the, models, marja, and, the,

being, a, higher, ranking, cleric, viewed, the, adherence, to, religion, in, a, society, as, beyond, one, person, or, one, interpretation, nouri, tried, to, get, support, from, mohammed, kazem, yazdi, another, prominent, marja, of, najaf, both, mohammad, kazem, and, khorasani, led, a, great, shia, school, in, najaf, although, they, had, different, views, in, politics, at, the, same, time, while,

holding, that, usulism, did, not, offer, the, liberty, to, support, constitutional, politics, in, his, view, politics, was, beyond, his, expertise, and, therefore, he, avoided, taking, part, in, it, therefore, during, the, iranian, constitutional, revolution, he, stayed, neutral, most, of, the, times, and, seldom, issued, any, political, statement, this, did, not, mean, he, supported, fazlullah,

and, 72, into, the, constitution, based, on, his, opinions, ayatullah, yazdi, said, that, as, long, as, modern, constitution, did, not, force, people, to, do, what, was, forbidden, by, sharia, and,

humiliation, of, the, shi, ite, state, you, may, reply, that, the, mullahs, did, not, allow, this, is, not, credible, i, can, foresee, that, my, country, wa, an, my, stature, and, prestige, my, service, to, islam, are, about, to, fall, into, the, hands, of, enemies, and, all, my, stature, gone, as, long, as, i, breathe, therefore, i, will, strive, for, the, preservation, of, this, country,

revolution, in, iran, is, mixed, ayatollah, ruhollah, khomeini, leader, of, the, 1979, iranian, islamic, revolution, who, was, a, child, at, the, time, of, the, constitutional, revolution, and, theorized, that, until, the, return, of, the, hidden, imam, islamic, jurists, should, rule, iran, asserted, that, decades, after, the, collapse, of, the, revolution, that, the, constitution, of, 1906, was, the, work, of, iranian, agents, of, imperialist, britain, conspiring, against, islam, who, were, instructed, by, their, masters, to, take, advantage, of, the, idea, of, constitutionalism, in, order, to, deceive, the, people, and, conceal, the, true, nature, of, their, political, crimes, at, the, beginning, of, the, constitutional, movement, when, people, wanted, to, write, laws, and, draw, up, a, constitution, a, copy, of, the, belgian, legal, code, was, borrowed, from, the, belgian, embassy, and, a, handful, of, individuals, whose, names, i, do, not, wish, to, mention, here, used, it, as, the, basis, for, the, constitution, they, then, wrote, supplementing, its, deficiencies, with, borrowings, from, the, french, and, british, legal, codes, true, they, added, some, of, the, ordinances, of, islam, in, order, to, deceive, the, people, but, the, basis, of, the, laws, that, were, now, thrust, upon, the, people, was, alien, and, borrowed, after, the, 1979, iranian, islamic,

of, the, shah, reza, aslan, argues, that, a, major, lesson, of, the, revolution, is, that, what, separates, the, countless, uprisings, and, popular, protests, throughout, the, last, hundred, odd, year, of, iranian, history, from, those, in, 1906, in, 1953, and, in, 1979, that, ultimately, resulted, in, radical, change, is, the, ability, to, bring, together, a, coalition, of, the, educated, middle, class, the, mid, level, clerics, and, the, seminary, students, who, maintain, an, enormous, amount, of, control, and, power, over, the, pious, masses, and, most, crucially, the, business,
