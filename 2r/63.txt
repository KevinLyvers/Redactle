reportedly, native, to, ukraine, included, polans, or, polianians, drevlyans, severians, ulichs, tiverians, white, croats, and, dulebes, but, their, precise, identity, and, interrelationships, are,

however, many, ukrainians, accepted, their, fate, in, the, russian, empire, and, some, were, able, to, achieve, great, success, there, the, fate, of, the, ukrainians, was, far, different, under, the, austrian, empire, where, they, found, themselves, in, the, pawn, position, of, the, russian, austrian, power, struggle, for, central, and, southern, europe, unlike, in, russia, most, of, the, elite,

occurrence, among, the, slavic, population, but, the, mass, exodus, of, ukrainian, intellectuals, escaping, from, russian, repression, in, eastern, ukraine, as, well, as, the, intervention, of, austrian, authorities, caused, the, movement, to, be, replaced, by, ukrainophilia, which, would, then, cross, over, into, the, russian, empire, the, 2, 4, million, ukrainians, under, the, habsburg,

prominent, ukrainian, political, figures, initially, sought, autonomy, within, a, federated, russia, however, as, political, instability, in, russia, deepened, the, upr, declared, full, independence, on, january, 22, 1918, the, fledgling, upr, faced, numerous, challenges, from, the, start, including, internal, political, divisions, economic, instability, and, external, threats, the, bolsheviks, who, were, rapidly, consolidating, power, in, russia, viewed, ukraine, as, a, critical, territory, for, their, revolutionary, ambitions, as, a, result, they, launched, military, campaigns, to, assert, control, over, ukrainian, lands, leading, to, a, series, of, conflicts, with, upr, forces, amid, growing, unrest, a, coup, d, tat, led, by, general, pavlo, skoropadskyi, on, april, 29, 1918, resulted, in, the, dissolution, of, the, upr, and, the, establishment, of, ukrainian, state, also, known, as, the, hetmanate, skoropadskyi, a, former, russian, imperial, army, officer, proclaimed, himself, hetman, of, all, ukraine, and, aimed, to, create, a, strong, centralized, state, with, close, ties, to, german, empire, and, austria, hungary, the, hetmanate, sought, to, restore, order, promote, economic, development, and, implement, agricultural, reforms, however, its, pro, german, stance, and, authoritarian, policies, alienated, many, ukrainians, including, nationalists, socialists, and, peasant, groups, as, the, central, powers, began, to, collapse, in, late, 1918, following, their, defeat, in, world, war, i, opposition, to, skoropadsky, s, regime, intensified, in, november, 1918, the, directorate, a, coalition, of, anti, hetmanate, forces, led, by, symon, petliura, volodymyr, vynnychenko, and, other, ukrainian, leaders, launched, a, successful, revolt, against, the, hetmanate, by, december, 1918, skoropadskyi, had, abdicated, and, the, ukrainian, state, was, dissolved, leading, to, the, restoration, of, the, ukrainian, people, s, republic, simultaneously, a, separate, ukrainian, state, emerged, in, the, western, part, of, the, country, the, west, ukrainian, people, s, republic, wupr, was, proclaimed, on, october, 19, 1918, following, the, collapse, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, it, was, centered, in, eastern, galicia, including, the, city, of, lviv, as, well, as, parts, of, bukovina, and, transcarpathia, regions, with, significant, ukrainian, populations, the, wupr, government, headed, by, yevhen, petrushevych, sought, to, establish, an, independent, ukrainian, state, in, western, ukraine, it, quickly, formed, an, administrative, structure, created, the, ukrainian, galician, army, and, implemented, social, and, economic, reforms, however, the, proclamation, of, the, wupr, and, its, claim, over, eastern, galicia, led, to, immediate, conflict, with, the, newly, re, established, polish, state, which, also, laid, claim, to, the, region, leading, to, the, polish, ukrainian, war, 1918, 1919, the, conflict, began, with, intense, fighting, in, lviv, where, polish, paramilitary, groups, resisted, ukrainian, control, despite, initial, successes, by, the, ukrainian, forces, the, polish, army, supported, by, the, entente, powers, gained, the, upper, hand, by, mid, 1919, polish, forces, launched, a, major, offensive, and, the, ukrainian, galician, army, was, forced, to, retreat, by, july, 1919, wupr, forces, had, crossed, into, upr, territory, effectively, ending, the, wupr, as, an, independent, state, in, an, effort, to, strengthen, their, positions, the, upr, and, wupr, formed, a, political, union, on, january, 22, 1919, the, act, zluky, declared, the, unification, of, the, two, republics, into, a, single, ukrainian, state, however, this, unification, was, largely, symbolic, and, did, not, result, in, significant, military, coordination, or, support, as, both, republics, were, preoccupied, with, their, own, military, struggles, the, upr, against, the, bolsheviks, and, the, wupr, against, polish, forces, after, being, driven, out, of, kyiv, by, bolshevik, forces, in, early, 1919, the, upr, government, led, by, symon, petliura, continued, to, resist, bolshevik, advances, and, polish, encroachment, by, 1920, facing, insurmountable, odds, and, a, deteriorating, military, position, petliura, sought, an, alliance, with, poland, in, april, 1920, the, treaty, of, warsaw, was, signed, under, which, the, upr, agreed, to, recognize, polish, control, over, western, ukraine, in, exchange, for, polish, military, support, against, the, bolsheviks, the, joint, polish, ukrainian, campaign, initially, achieved, some, success, including, the, temporary, recapture, of, kyiv, in, may, 1920, however, the, bolshevik, counter, offensive, soon, pushed, back, the, allied, forces, the, situation, for, the, upr, became, even, more, precarious, when, poland, sought, a, peace, agreement, with, soviet, russia, culminating, in, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, riga, in, march, 1921, the, treaty, effectively, partitioned, ukraine, leaving, most, of, its, territory, under, soviet, control, and, the, western, parts, under, polish, administration, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, riga, the, upr, government, went, into, exile, primarily, in, poland, and, other, european, countries, ukrainian, leaders, continued, their, efforts, to, advocate, for, ukrainian, independence, in, the, international, arena, but, without, a, territorial, base, or, significant, military, forces, their, influence, was, limited, symon, petliura, a, key, figure, in, the, upr, continued, his, political, activities, in, exile, until, his, assassination, in, paris, in, 1926, historian, paul, kubicek, says, canadian, scholar, orest, subtelny, says, as, the, upr, and, wupr, faced, defeat, bolsheviks, consolidated, their, control, over, ukraine, on, december, 30, 1919, ukrainian, socialist, soviet, republic, ukrainian, ssr, was, proclaimed, by, bolsheviks, this, new, soviet, government, aligned, closely, with, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, rsfsr, and, aimed, to, establish, soviet, authority, over, all, ukrainian, territories, the, creation, of, the, ukrainian, ssr, marked, the, beginning, of, soviet, rule, in, ukraine, by, 1921, the, red, army, had, defeated, the, remaining, ukrainian, forces, and, other, opponents, and, the, ukrainian, ssr, became, one, of, the, founding, republics, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1922, in, the, 1920s, the, soviet, government, implemented, a, policy, of, ukrainization, as, part, of, its, broader, strategy, to, strengthen, support, for, the, soviet, regime, in, non, russian, republics, this, policy, encouraged, the, use, of, the, ukrainian, language, in, education, government, and, media, ukrainian, culture, and, history, were, promoted, to, win, over, the, local, population, and, intellectual, elite, ukrainization, allowed, a, degree, of, cultural, revival, after, years, of, russian, dominance, in, ukraine, ukrainian, literature, theater, and, arts, experienced, significant, growth, and, schools, began, teaching, in, the, ukrainian, language, however, this, policy, was, carefully, controlled, by, the, communist, party, ensuring, that, cultural, development, aligned, with, soviet, ideology, following, the, devastation, of, war, and, revolution, the, soviet, government, introduced, the, new, economic, policy, nep, to, stabilize, the, economy, it, represented, a, temporary, retreat, from, pure, socialist, policies, allowing, some, elements, of, private, enterprise, and, market, mechanisms, to, function, alongside, state, controlled, industries, the, nep, had, a, mixed, impact, on, ukraine, on, one, hand, it, allowed, limited, economic, recovery, especially, in, agriculture, and, small, scale, industry, peasants, were, permitted, to, sell, surplus, products, on, the, market, and, small, businesses, could, operate, under, certain, conditions, on, the, other, hand, large, scale, industries, remained, under, state, control, and, the, heavy, industrial, sector, which, ukraine, relied, on, remained, inefficient, and, slow, to, recover, while, the, nep, offered, some, relief, to, peasants, many, remained, suspicious, of, soviet, power, particularly, after, the, harsh, grain, requisition, policies, during, the, civil, war, tensions, between, the, peasantry, and, the, soviet, regime, continued, to, simmer, during, this, period, the, communist, party, tightened, its, control, over, ukraine, the, communist, party, of, ukraine, cpu, became, a, key, instrument, in, enforcing, soviet, policies, and, maintaining, order, political, power, was, highly, centralized, with, decisions, made, in, moscow, dictating, policy, in, ukraine, despite, the, relative, cultural, freedom, of, ukrainization, any, political, opposition, to, the, soviet, regime, was, harshly, repressed, former, nationalists, intellectuals, and, opponents, of, soviet, power, were, marginalized, and, any,

a, critical, industrial, center, especially, in, coal, steel, and, machinery, production, while, some, infrastructure, was, rebuilt, economic, challenges, remained, due, to, the, inefficiency, of,

production, despite, the, nep, rural, areas, continued, to, suffer, from, poverty, which, would, later, fuel, resistance, to, soviet, policies, by, the, late, 1920s, the, nep, was, being, phased, out, as, the, soviet, union, prepared, for, a, shift, towards, more, centralized, and, state, controlled, economic, policies, under, stalin, the, focus, was, moving, toward, heavy, industrialization, and, forced, collectivization, setting, the, stage, for, the, dramatic, and, tragic, events, of, the, 1930s, including, the, holodomor, although, ukrainization, was, relatively, successful, in, the, 1920s, by, the, end, of, the, decade, stalin, s, regime, began, to, reverse, this, policy, with, a, focus, on, russian, centralization, the, coming, years, would, see, a, crackdown, on, ukrainian, nationalism, and, culture, as, part, of, stalin, s, larger, efforts, to, solidify, control, over, the, soviet, republics, in, 1929, joseph, stalin, launched, a, campaign, of, forced, collectivization, across, the, soviet, union, including, ukraine, the, policy, aimed, to, consolidate, individual, peasant, farms, into, large, state, controlled, collective, farms, kolkhozes, to, increase, agricultural, productivity, and, secure, grain, supplies, for, rapid, industrialization, ukrainian, peasants, particularly, wealthier, ones, known, as, kulaks, resisted, collectivization, the, soviet, regime, responded, with, brutal, force, seizing, land, livestock, and, grain, and, deporting, or, executing, those, who, resisted, collectivization, led, to, widespread, chaos, in, rural, areas,

during, the, holodomor, entire, villages, were, decimated, and, the, event, remains, one, of, the, most, tragic, episodes, in, ukrainian, history, the, soviet, government, denied, the, famine, s,

landscape, throughout, the, 1930s, stalin, s, regime, was, marked, by, increasing, paranoia, and, a, desire, to, eliminate, any, perceived, threats, to, his, power, this, led, to, widespread, political, repression, which, affected, all, levels, of, society, in, ukraine, the, purges, targeted, ukrainian, intellectuals, artists, political, leaders, and, anyone, accused, of, harboring, nationalist, sentiments, the, goal, was, to, eliminate, any, potential, sources, of, dissent, or, opposition, to, soviet, rule, the, great, purge, reached, its, peak, between, 1936, and, 1938, in, ukraine, thousands, were, arrested, tortured, and, executed, or, sent, to, labor, camps, gulag, in, remote, regions, of, the, soviet, union, the, intelligentsia, who, had, been, initially, encouraged,

other, parts, of, the, world, came, chiefly, from, russian, secondary, sources, until, relatively, recently, after, the, second, half, of, the, seventeenth, century, when, muscovy, and, later, the, russian, empire, came, to, control, much, of, ukrainian, territory, russian, writers, included, ukraine, as, part, of, russian, history, this, included, referring, to, medieval, kievan, rus, as, kievan, russia, and, its, old, east, slavic, culture, and, inhabitants, as, kievan, russian, or, old, russian, later, ukraine, or, its, parts, were, called, little, russia, south, russia, west, russia, with, belarus, or, new, russia, the, black, sea, coast, and, southeastern, steppe, but, parts, of, ukraine, beyond, russia, s, reach, were, called, ruthenia, and, its, people, ruthenians, the, names, chosen, to, refer, to, ukraine, and, ukrainians, have, often, reflected, a, certain, political, position, and, sometimes, even, to, deny, the, existence, of, ukrainian, nationality, 10, 11, the, russian, point, of, view, of, ukrainian, history, became, the, prevailing, one, in, western, academia, and, although, the, bias, was, identified, as, early, as, the, 1950s, many, scholars, of, slavic, studies, and, history, believe, significant, changes, are, still, necessary, to, correct, the, moscow, centric, view, the, scholarly, study, of, ukraine, s, history, emerged, from, romantic, impulses, in, the, late, 19th, century, when, german, romanticism, spread, to, eastern, europe, the, outstanding, leaders, were, volodymyr, antonovych, 1834, 1908, based, in, kiev, and, his, student, mykhailo, hrushevsky, 1866, 1934, the, first, serious, challenge, to, the, russian, view, of, ukraine, was, hrushevsky, s, 1904, article, the, traditional, scheme, of, russian, history, and, the, problem, of, the, rational, organization, of, the, history, of, the, eastern, slavs, for, the, first, time, full, scale, scholarly, studies, based, on, archival, sources, modern, research, techniques, and, modern, historical, theories, became, possible, however, the, demands, of, government, officials, tsarist, to, a, lesser, degree, austro, hungarian, and, polish, and, later, soviet, made, it, difficult, to, disseminate, ideas, that, ran, counter, to, the, central, government, therefore, exile, schools, of, historians, emerged, in, central, europe, and, canada, after, 1920, strikingly, different, interpretations, of, the, medieval, state, of, kievan, rus, appear, in, the, four, schools, of, historiography, within, ukraine, russophile, sovietophile, eastern, slavic, and, ukrainophile, in, the, soviet, union, there, was, a, radical, break, after, 1921, led, by, mikhail, pokrovsky, until, 1934, history, was, generally, not, regarded, as, chauvinistic, but, was, rewritten, in, the, style, of, marxist, historiography, national, pasts, were, rewritten, as, social, and, national, liberation, for, non, russians, and, social, liberation, for, russians, in, a, process, that, ended, in, 1917, under, stalin, the, state, and, its, official, historiography, were, given, a, distinct, russian, character, and, a, certain, russocentrism, imperial, history, was, rewritten, such, that, non, russian, love, caused, an, emulation, and, deference, to, join, the, russian, people, by, becoming, part, of, the, tsarist, russian, state, and, in, return, russian, state, interests, were, driven, by, altruism, and, concern, for, neighboring, people, russophile, and, sovietophile, schools, have, become, marginalized, in, independent, ukraine, with, the, ukrainophile, school, being, dominant, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, ukrainophile, school, promotes, an, identity, that, is, mutually, exclusive, of, russia, it, has, come, to, dominate, the, nation, s, educational, system, security, forces, and, national, symbols, and, monuments, although, it, has, been, dismissed, as, nationalist, by, western, historians, the, east, slavic, school, an, eclectic, compromise, between, ukrainophiles, and, russophilism, has, a, weaker, ideological, and, symbolic, base, although, it, is, preferred, by, ukraine, s, centrist, former, elites, many, historians, in, recent, years, have, sought, alternatives, to, national, histories, and, ukrainian, history, invited, approaches, that, looked, beyond, a, national, paradigm, multiethnic, history, recognises, the, numerous, peoples, in, ukraine, transnational, history, portrays, ukraine, as, a, border, zone, for, various, empires, and, area, studies, categorises, ukraine, as, part, of, east, central, europe, or, less, often, as, part, of, eurasia, serhii, plokhy, argues, that, looking, beyond, the, country, s, national, history, has, made, possible, a, richer, understanding, of, ukraine, its, people, and, the, surrounding, regions, since, 2015, there, has, been, renewed, interest, in, integrating, a, territorial, civic, and, linguistic, ethnic, history, of, ukraine, for, example, the, history, of, the, crimean, tatars, and, the, more, distant, history, of, the, crimea, peninsula, is, now, integrated, into, ukrainian, school, history, this, is, part, of, the, constitutionally, mandated, people, of, ukraine, rather, than, ukrainian, people, slowly, the, histories, of, poles, and, jews, are, also, being, reintegrated, however, due, to, the, current, political, climate, caused, by, territorial, sovereignty, breaches, by, russia, the, role, of, russians, as, co, host, has, been, greatly, minimized, and, there, are, still, unresolved, difficult, issues, of, the, past, for, example, the, role,
