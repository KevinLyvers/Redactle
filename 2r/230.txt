rashidun, caliphate, centuries, earlier, beginning, with, the, first, crusade, which, resulted, in, the, conquest, of, jerusalem, in, 1099, dozens, of, military, campaigns, were, organised, providing, a, focal, point, of, european, history, for, centuries, crusading, declined, rapidly, after, the, 15th, century, in, 1095, after, a, byzantine, request, for, aid, pope, urban, ii, proclaimed, the, first, expedition, at, the, council, of, clermont, he, encouraged, military, support, for, byzantine, emperor, alexios, i, komnenos, and, called, for, an, armed, pilgrimage, to, jerusalem, across, all, social, strata, in, western, europe, there, was, an, enthusiastic, response, participants, came, from, all, over, europe, and, had, a, variety, of, motivations, these, included, religious, salvation, satisfying, feudal, obligations, opportunities, for, renown, and, economic, or, political, advantage, later, expeditions, were, conducted, by, generally, more, organised, armies, sometimes, led, by, a, king, all, were, granted, papal, indulgences, initial, successes, established, four, crusader, states, the, county, of, edessa, the, principality, of, antioch, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem,

exercise, and, so, earned, participants, remittance, from, penalties, for, all, confessed, sins, what, constituted, a, crusade, has, been, understood, in, diverse, ways, particularly, regarding, the, early, crusades, and, the, precise, definition, remains, a, matter, of, debate, among, contemporary, historians, at, the, time, of, the, first, crusade, iter, journey, and, peregrinatio, pilgrimage, were, used, for, the, campaign, crusader, terminology, remained, largely, indistinguishable, from, that, of, christian, pilgrimage, during, the, 12th, century, a, specific, term, for, a, crusader, in, the, form, of, crucesignatus, one, signed, by, the, cross, emerged, in, the, early, 12th, century, this, led, to, the, french, term, croisade, the, way, of, the, cross, by, the, mid, 13th, century, the, cross, became, the, major, descriptor, of, the, crusades, with, crux, transmarina, the, cross, overseas, used, for, crusades, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, crux, cismarina, the, cross, this, side, of, the, sea, for, those, in, europe, the, use, of, croiserie, crusade, in, middle, english, can, be, dated, to, c, 1300, but, the, modern, english, crusade, dates, to, the, early, 1700s,

the, east, all, competed, with, the, empire, and, the, emperors, recruited, mercenaries, even, on, occasions, from, their, enemies, to, meet, this, challenge, the, political, situation, in, western, asia, was, changed, by, later, waves, of, turkish, migration, in, particular, the, arrival, of, the, seljuk, turks, in, the, 10th, century, previously, a, minor, ruling, clan, from, transoxania, they, had, recently, converted, to, islam, and, migrated, into, iran, in, two, decades, following, their, arrival, they, conquered, iran, iraq, and, the, near, east, the, seljuks, and, their, followers,

seljuks, sporadic, raiding, leading, to, his, defeat, at, the, battle, of, manzikert, historians, once, considered, this, a, pivotal, event, but, now, manzikert, is, regarded, as, only, one, further, step, in, the, expansion, of, the, great, seljuk, empire, the, evolution, of, a, christian, theology, of, war, developed, from, the, link, of, roman, citizenship, to, christianity, according, to,

that, the, effectiveness, was, limited, and, it, had, died, out, by, the, time, of, the, crusades, pope, alexander, ii, developed, a, system, of, recruitment, via, oaths, for, military, resourcing, that, his, successor, pope, gregory, vii, extended, across, europe, in, the, 11th, century, christian, conflict, with, muslims, on, the, southern, peripheries, of, christendom, was, sponsored, by, the, church, including, the, siege, of, barbastro, and, the, norman, conquest, of, sicily, in, 1074, gregory, vii, planned, a, display, of, military, power, to, reinforce, the, principle, of, papal, sovereignty, his, vision, of, a, holy, war, supporting, byzantium, against, the, seljuks, was, the, first, crusade, prototype, but, lacked, support, the, first, crusade, was, an, unexpected, event, for, contemporary, chroniclers, but, historical, analysis, demonstrates, it, had, its, roots, in, earlier, developments, with, both, clerics, and, laity, recognising, jerusalem, s, role, in, christianity, as, worthy, of, penitential, pilgrimage, in, 1071, jerusalem, was, captured, by, the, turkish, warlord, atsiz, who, seized, most, of, syria, and, palestine, as, part, of, the, expansion,

for, military, aid, converged, with, increasing, willingness, of, the, western, nobility, to, accept, papal, military, direction, in, 1095, byzantine, emperor, alexios, i, komnenos, requested, military, aid, from, pope, urban, ii, at, the, council, of, piacenza, he, was, probably, expecting, a, small, number, of, mercenaries, he, could, direct, alexios, had, restored, the, empire, s, finances, and, authority, but, still, faced, numerous, foreign, enemies, later, that, year, at, the, council, of, clermont, urban, raised, the, issue, again, and, preached, a, crusade, almost, immediately, the, french, priest, peter, the, hermit, gathered, thousands, of, mostly, poor, in, the, people, s, crusade, traveling, through, germany, german, bands, massacred, jewish, communities, in, the, rhineland, massacres, during, wide, ranging, anti, jewish, activities, jews, were, perceived, to, be, as, much, an, enemy, as, muslims, they, were, held, responsible, for, the, crucifixion, and, were, more, immediately, visible, people, wondered, why, they, should, travel, thousands, of, miles, to, fight, non, believers, when, there, were, many, closer, to, home, quickly, after, leaving,

contingents, in, loose, fluid, arrangements, based, on, bonds, of, lordship, family, ethnicity, and, language, the, elder, statesman, raymond, iv, count, of, toulouse, was, foremost, rivaled, by, the, relatively, poor, but, martial, italo, norman, bohemond, of, taranto, and, his, nephew, tancred, godfrey, of, bouillon, and, his, brother, baldwin, and, forces, from, lorraine, lotharingia, and, germany, also, joined, these, five, princes, were, pivotal, to, the, campaign, which, was, augmented, by, a, northern, french, army, led, by, robert, curthose, count, stephen, ii, of, blois, and, count, robert, ii, of, flanders, the, total, number, may, have, reached, as, many, as, 100, 000, people, including, non, combatants, they, traveled, eastward, by, land, to, constantinople, where, they, were, cautiously, welcomed, by, the, emperor, alexios, persuaded, many, of, the, princes, to, pledge, allegiance, to, him, and, that, their, first, objective, should, be, nicaea, the, capital, of, the, sultanate, of, rum, sultan, kilij, arslan, left, the, city, to, resolve, a, territorial, dispute, enabling, its, capture, after, the, siege, of, nicaea, and, a, byzantine, naval, assault, in,

for, three, months, to, the, former, byzantine, city, antioch, that, had, been, in, muslim, control, since, 1084, starvation, thirst, and, disease, reduced, numbers, combined, with, baldwin, s, decision, to, leave, with, 100, knights, and, their, followers, to, carve, out, his, own, territory, in, edessa, the, siege, of, antioch, lasted, eight, months, the, crusaders, lacked, the, resources, to, fully, invest, the, city, the, residents, lacked, the, means, to, repel, the, invaders, then, bohemond, persuaded, a, guard, in, the, city, to, open, a, gate, the, crusaders, entered, massacring, the, muslim, inhabitants, and, many, christians, amongst, the, greek, orthodox, syrian, and, armenian, communities, a, force, to, recapture, the, city, was, raised, by, kerbogha, the, effective, ruler, of, mosul, the, byzantines, did, not, march, to, the, assistance, of, the, crusaders, after, the, deserting, stephen, of, blois, told, them, the, cause, was, lost, alexius, retreated, from, philomelium, where, he, received, stephen, s, report, to, constantinople, the, greeks, were, never, truly, forgiven, for, this, perceived, betrayal, and, stephen, was, branded, a, coward, losing, numbers, through, desertion, and, starvation, in, the, besieged, city, the, crusaders, attempted, a, negotiated, surrender, but, were, rejected, bohemond, recognised, that, the, only, option, was, open, combat, and, launched, a, counterattack, despite, superior, numbers, kerbogha, s, army, which, was, divided, into, factions, and, surprised, by, the, crusaders, commitment, retreated, and, abandoned, the, siege, raymond, besieged, arqa, in, february, 1099, and, sent, an, embassy, to, al, afdal, shahanshah, the, vizier, of, fatimid, egypt, seeking, a, treaty, the, pope, s, representative, adhemar, died, leaving, the, crusade, without, a, spiritual, leader, raymond, failed, to, capture, arqa, and, in, may, led, the, remaining, army, south, along, the, coast, bohemond, retained, antioch, and, remained, despite, his, pledge, to, return, it, to, the, byzantines, local, rulers, offered, little, resistance, opting, for, peace, in, return, for, provisions, the, frankish, envoys, returned, accompanied, by, fatimid, representatives, this, brought, the, information, that, the, fatimids, had, recaptured, jerusalem, the, franks, offered, to, partition, conquered, territory, in, return, for, the, city, refusal, of, the, offer, made, it, imperative, that, the, crusade, reach, jerusalem, before, the, fatimids, made, it, defensible, the, first, attack, on, the, city, launched, on, 7, june, 1099, failed, and, the, siege, of, jerusalem, became, a, stalemate, before, the, arrival, of, craftsmen, and, supplies, transported, by, the, genoese, to, jaffa, tilted, the, balance, two, large, siege, engines, were, constructed, and, the, one, commanded, by, godfrey, breached, the, walls, on, 15, july, for, two, days, the, crusaders, massacred, the, inhabitants, and, pillaged, the, city, historians, now, believe, the, accounts, of, the, numbers, killed, have, been, exaggerated, but, this, narrative, of, massacre, did, much, to, cement, the, crusaders, reputation, for, barbarism, godfrey, secured, the, frankish, position, by, defeating, an, egyptian, force, at, the, battle, of, ascalon, on, 12, august, most, of, the, crusaders, considered, their, pilgrimage, complete, and, returned, to, europe, when, it, came, to, the, future, governance, of, the, city, it, was, godfrey, who, took, leadership, and, the, title, of, advocatus, sancti, sepulchri, defender, of, the, holy, sepulchre, the, presence, of, troops, from, lorraine, ended, the, possibility, that, jerusalem, would, be, an, ecclesiastical, domain, and, the, claims, of, raymond, godfrey, was, left, with, a, mere, 300, knights, and, 2, 000, infantry, tancred, also, remained, with, the, ambition, to, gain, a, princedom, of, his, own, the, islamic, world, seems, to, have, barely, registered, the, crusade, certainly, there, is, limited, written, evidence, before, 1130, this, may, be, in, part, due, to, a, reluctance, to, relate, muslim, failure, but, it, is, more, likely, to, be, the, result, of, cultural, misunderstanding, al, afdal, shahanshah, and, the, muslim, world, mistook, the, crusaders, for, the, latest, in, a, long, line, of, byzantine, mercenaries, not, religiously, motivated, warriors, intent, on, conquest, and, settlement, the, muslim, world, was, divided, between, the, sunnis, of, syria, and, iraq, and, the, shi, ite, fatimids, of, egypt, the,

and, abbasid, caliph, al, mustazhir, were, engaged, in, a, power, struggle, this, gave, the, crusaders, a, crucial, opportunity, to, consolidate, without, any, pan, islamic, counter, attack, urban, ii, died, on, 29, july, 1099, fourteen, days, after, the, capture, of, jerusalem, by, the, crusaders, but, before, news, of, the, event, had, reached, rome, he, was, succeeded, by, pope, paschal, ii,

to, come, south, but, he, was, captured, by, the, danishmends, the, lorrainers, foiled, the, attempt, to, seize, power, and, enabled, godfrey, s, brother, baldwin, i, to, take, the, crown, paschal,

raymond, of, saint, gilles, command, was, fragmented, and, the, force, split, in, three, the, defeat, of, the, crusaders, proved, to, the, muslim, world, that, the, crusaders, were, not, invincible,

early, in, 1218, as, it, became, clear, that, frederick, ii, was, not, coming, to, the, east, the, remaining, commanders, began, the, planning, to, attack, the, egyptian, port, of, damietta, the,

by, his, son, al, kamil, further, offensive, action, by, the, crusaders, would, have, to, wait, until, the, arrival, of, additional, forces, including, legate, pelagius, with, a, contingent, of,

neither, afford, nor, mount, a, lengthening, campaign, in, the, holy, land, given, the, ongoing, war, of, the, keys, with, rome, the, sixth, crusade, would, be, one, of, negotiation, after, resolving, the, internecine, struggles, in, syria, al, kamil, s, position, was, stronger, than, it, was, a, year, before, when, he, made, his, original, offer, to, frederick, for, unknown, reasons, the, two, sides, came, to, an, agreement, the, resultant, treaty, of, jaffa, was, concluded, on, 18, february, 1229, with, al, kamil, surrendering, jerusalem, with, the, exception, of, some, muslim, holy,

orders, then, convinced, theobald, to, retreat, to, acre, rather, than, pursue, the, egyptians, and, their, frankish, prisoners, a, month, after, the, battle, at, gaza, an, nasir, d, d, emir, of,

was, the, first, of, the, two, crusades, led, by, louis, ix, of, france, also, known, as, the, crusade, of, louis, ix, to, the, holy, land, its, objective, was, to, reclaim, the, holy, land, by, attacking, egypt, the, main, seat, of, muslim, power, in, the, middle, east, then, under, as, salih, ayyub, son, of, al, kamil, the, crusade, was, conducted, in, response, to, setbacks, in, the,

of, damietta, was, a, shock, to, the, muslim, world, and, as, salih, ayyub, offered, to, trade, damietta, for, jerusalem, as, his, father, had, thirty, years, before, the, offer, was, rejected, by,

obsolete, in, 1699, with, the, final, holy, league, prior, to, the, 11th, century, the, latin, church, had, developed, a, system, for, the, remission, and, absolution, of, sin, in, return, for, contrition, confession, and, penitential, acts, reparation, through, abstinence, from, martial, activity, still, presented, a, difficulty, to, the, noble, warrior, class, it, was, revolutionary, when, gregory, vii, offered, absolution, of, sin, earned, through, the, church, sponsored, violence, in, support, of, his, causes, if, selflessly, given, at, the, end, of, the, century, this, was, developed, by, subsequent, popes, into, the, granting, of, plenary, indulgences, that, reduced, all, god, imposed, temporal, penalties, the, papacy, developed, political, augustinianism, into, attempts, to, remove, the, church, from, secular, control, by, asserting, ecclesiastical, supremacy, over, temporal, polities, and, the, orthodox, church, this, was, associated, with, the, idea, that, the, church, should, actively, intervene, in, the, world, to, impose, justice, a, distinct, ideology, promoting, and, regulating, crusading, is, evidenced, in, surviving, texts, the, church, defined, this, in, legal, and, theological, terms, based, on, the, theory, of, holy, war, and, the, concept, of, pilgrimage, theology, merged, the, old, testament, israelite, wars, instigated, and, assisted, by, god, with, new, testament, christocentric, views, holy, war, was, based, on, ancient, ideas, of, just, war, the, fourth, century, theologian, augustine, of, hippo, had, christianised, this, and, it, eventually, became, the, paradigm, of, christian, holy, war, theologians, widely, accepted, the, justification, that, holy, war, against, pagans, was, good, because, of, their, opposition, to, christianity, the, holy, land, was, the, patrimony, of, christ, its, recovery, was, on, behalf, of, god, the, albigensian, crusade, was, a, defence, of, the, french, church, the, northern, crusades, were, campaigns, conquering, lands, beloved, of, christ, s, mother, mary, for, christianity, inspired, by, the, first, crusade, the, crusading, movement, went, on, to, define, late, medieval, western, culture, and, impacted, the, history, of, the, western, islamic, world, christendom, was, geopolitical, and, this, underpinned, the, practice, of, the, medieval, church, reformists, of, the, 11th, century, urged, these, ideas, which, declined, following, the, reformation, the, ideology, continued, after, the, 16th, century, with, the, military, orders, but, dwindled, in, competition, with, other, forms, of, religious, war, and, new, ideologies, the, military, orders, were, forms, of, a, religious, order, first, established, early, in, the, twelfth, century, with, the, function, of, defending, christians, as, well, as, observing, monastic, vows, the, knights, hospitaller, had, a, medical, mission, in, jerusalem, since, before, the, first, crusade, later, becoming, a, formidable, military, force, supporting, the, crusades, in, the, holy, land, and, mediterranean, the, knights, templar, were, founded, in, 1119, by, a, band, of, knights, who, dedicated, themselves, to, protecting, pilgrims, en, route, to, jerusalem, the, teutonic, knights, were, formed, in, 1190, to, protect, pilgrims, in, both, the, holy, land, and, baltic, region, the, hospitallers, and, the, templars, became, supranational, organisations, as, papal, support, led, to, rich, donations, of, land, and, revenue, across, europe, this, in, turn, led, to, a, steady, flow, of, new, recruits, and, the, wealth, to, maintain, multiple, fortifications, in, the, crusader, states, in, time, they, developed, into, autonomous, powers, in, the, region, after, the, fall, of, acre, the, hospitallers, relocated, to, cyprus, then, ruled, rhodes, until, the, island, was, taken, by, the, ottomans, in, 1522, while, there, was, talk, of, merging, the, templars, and, hospitallers, in, 1305, by, clement, v, ultimately, the, templars, were, charged, with, heresy, and, disbanded, the, teutonic, knights, supported, the, later, prussian, campaigns, into, the, fifteenth, century, according, to, the, historian, joshua, prawer, no, major, european, poet, theologian, scholar, or, historian, settled, in, the, crusader, states, some, went, on, pilgrimage, and, this, is, seen, in, new, imagery, and, ideas, in, western, poetry, although, they, did, not, migrate, east, themselves, their, output, often, encouraged, others, to, journey, there, on, pilgrimage, historians, consider, the, crusader, military, architecture, of, the, middle, east, to, demonstrate, a, synthesis, of, the, european, byzantine, and, muslim, traditions, and, to, be, the, most, original, and, impressive, artistic, achievement, of, the, crusades, castles, were, a, tangible, symbol, of, the, dominance, of, a, latin, christian, minority, over, a, largely, hostile, majority, population, they, also, acted, as, centres, of, administration, modern, historiography, rejects, the, 19th, century, consensus, that, westerners, learnt, the, basis, of, military, architecture, from, the, near, east, as, europe, had, already, experienced, rapid, development, in, defensive, technology, before, the, first, crusade, direct, contact, with, arab, fortifications, originally, constructed, by, the, byzantines, did, influence, developments, in, the, east, but, the, lack, of, documentary, evidence, means, that, it, remains, difficult, to, differentiate, between, the, importance, of, this, design, culture, and, the, constraints, of, situation, the, latter, led, to, the, inclusion, of, oriental, design, features, such, as, large, water, reservoirs, and, the, exclusion, of, occidental, features, such, as, moats, typically, crusader, church, design, was, in, the, french, romanesque, style, this, can, be, seen, in, the, 12th, century, rebuilding, of, the, holy, sepulchre, it, retained, some, of, the, byzantine, details, but, new, arches, and, chapels, were, built, to, northern, french, aquitanian, and, proven, al, patterns, there, is, little, trace, of, any, surviving, indigenous, influence, in, sculpture, although, in, the, holy, sepulchre, the, column, capitals, of, the, south, facade, follow, classical, syrian, patterns, in, contrast, to, architecture, and, sculpture, it, is, in, the, area, of, visual, culture, that, the, assimilated, nature, of, the, society, was, demonstrated, throughout, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, the, influence, of, indigenous, artists, was, demonstrated, in, the, decoration, of, shrines, paintings, and, the, production, of, illuminated, manuscripts, frankish, practitioners, borrowed, methods, from, the, byzantines, and, indigenous, artists, and, iconographical, practice, leading, to, a, cultural, synthesis, illustrated, by, the, church, of, the, nativity, wall, mosaics, were, unknown, in, the, west, but, in, widespread, use, in, the, crusader, states, whether, this, was, by, indigenous, craftsmen, or, learnt, by, frankish, ones, is, unknown, but, a, distinctive, original, artistic, style, evolved, manuscripts, were, produced, and, illustrated, in, workshops, housing, italian, french, english, and, local, craftsmen, leading, to, a, cross, fertilisation, of, ideas, and, techniques, an, example, of, this, is, the, melisende, psalter, created, by, several, hands, in, a, workshop, attached, to, the, holy, sepulchre, this, style, could, have, both, reflected, and, influenced, the, taste, of, patrons, of, the, arts, but, what, is, seen, is, an, increase, in, stylised, byzantine, influenced, content, this, extended, to, the, production, of, icons, unknown, at, the, time, to, the, franks, sometimes, in, a, frankish, style, and, even, of, western, saints, this, is, seen, as, the, origin, of, italian, panel, painting, while, it, is, difficult, to, track, illumination, of, manuscripts, and, castle, design, back, to, their, origins, textual, sources, are, simpler, the, translations, made, in, antioch, are, notable, but, they, are, considered, of, secondary, importance, to, the, works, emanating, from, muslim, spain, and, from, the, hybrid, culture, of, sicily, crusade, finance, and, taxation, left, a, legacy, of, social, financial, and, legal, institutions, property, became, available, while, coinage, and, precious, materials, circulated, more, readily, within, europe, crusading, expeditions, created, immense, demands, for, food, supplies, weapons, and, shipping, that, benefited, merchants, and, artisans, levies, for, crusades, contributed, to, the, development, of, centralised, financial, administrations, and, the, growth, of, papal, and, royal, taxation, this, aided, development, of, representative, bodies, whose, consent, was, required, for, many, forms, of, taxation, the, crusades, strengthened, exchanges, between, oriental, and, occidental, economic, spheres, the, transport, of, pilgrims, and, crusaders, notably, benefitted, italian, maritime, cities, such, as, the, trio, of, venice, pisa, and, genoa, having, obtained, commercial, privileges, in, the, fortified, places, of, syria, they, became, the, favoured, intermediaries, for, trade, in, goods, such, as, silk, spices, as, well, as, other, raw, alimentary, goods, and, mineral, products, trade, with, the, muslim, world, was, thus, extended, beyond, existing, limits, merchants, were, further, advantaged, by, technological, improvements, and, long, distance, trade, as, a, whole, expanded, the, increased, volume, of, goods, being, traded, through, ports, of, the, latin, levant, and, the, muslim, world, made, this, the, cornerstone, of, a, wider, middle, eastern, economy, as, manifested, in, important, cities, along, the, trade, routes, such, as, aleppo, damascus, and, acre, it, became, increasingly, common, for, european, merchants, to, venture, further, east, and, business, was, conducted, fairly, despite, religious, differences, and, continued, even, in, times, of, political, and, military, tensions, the, crusades, created, national, mythologies, tales, of, heroism, and, a, few, place, names, historical, parallelism, and, the, tradition, of, drawing, inspiration, from, the, middle, ages, have, become, keystones, of, political, islam, encouraging, ideas, of, a, modern, jihad, and, a, centuries, long, struggle, against, christian, states, while, secular, arab, nationalism, highlights, the, role, of, western, imperialism, modern, muslim, thinkers, politicians, and, historians, have, drawn, parallels, between, the, crusades, and, political, developments, such, as, the, establishment, of, israel, in, 1948, right, wing, circles, in, the, western, world, have, drawn, opposing, parallels, considering, christianity, to, be, under, an, islamic, religious, and, demographic, threat, that, is, analogous, to, the, situation, at, the, time, of, the, crusades, crusader, symbols, and, anti, islamic, rhetoric, are, presented, as, an, appropriate, response, these, symbols, and, rhetoric, are, used, to, provide, a, religious, justification, and, inspiration, for, a, struggle, against, a, religious, enemy, the, historiography, of, the, crusades, is, concerned, with, their, history, of, the, histories, during, the, crusader, period, the, subject, is, a, complex, one, with,
