as, indivisible, this, led, to, the, creation, of, a, new, shinto, and, increased, emperor, worship, on, february, 26, 1936, a, coup, d, tat, was, attempted, the, february, 26, incident, launched, by, the, ultranationalist, k, d, ha, faction, with, the, military, it, ultimately, failed, due, to, the, intervention, of, the, emperor, k, d, ha, members, were, purged, from, the, top, military, positions, and, the, t, seiha, faction, gained, dominance, however, both, factions, believed, in, expansionism, a, strong, military, and, a, coming, war, furthermore, k, d, ha, members, while, removed, from, the, military, still, had, political, influence, within, the, government, the, state, was, being, transformed, to, serve, the, army, and, the, emperor, symbolic, katana, swords, came, back, into, fashion, as, the, martial, embodiment, of, these, beliefs, and, the, nambu, pistol, became, its, contemporary, equivalent, with, the, implicit, message, that, the, army, doctrine, of, close, combat, would, prevail, the, final, objective, as, envisioned, by, army, thinkers, such, as, sadao, araki, and, right, wing, line, followers, was, a, return, to, the, old, shogunate, system, but, in, the, form, of, a, contemporary, military, shogunate, in, such, a, government, the, emperor, would, once, more, be, a, figurehead, as, in, the, edo, period, real, power, would, fall, to, a, leader, very, similar, to, a, f, hrer, or, duce, though, with, the, power, less, nakedly, held, on, the, other, hand, the, traditionalist, navy, militarists, defended, the, emperor, and, a, constitutional, monarchy, with, a, significant, religious, aspect, a, third, point, of, view, was, supported, by, prince, chichibu, a, brother, of, emperor, sh, wa, who, repeatedly, counseled, him, to, implement, a, direct, imperial, rule, even, if, that, meant, suspending, the, constitution, with, the, launching, of, the, imperial, rule, assistance, association, in, 1940, by, prime, minister, fumimaro, konoe, japan, would, turn, to, a, form, of, government, that, resembled, totalitarianism, this, unique, style, of, government, similar, to, fascism, was, known, as, sh, wa, statism, there, has, been, a, debate, among, historians, over, defining, the, political, system, of, japan, as, a, dictatorship, and, its, resemblance, to, european, fascism, the, aurguments, in, favour, of, this, view, were, the, subordination, of, both, country, and, society, to, militarism, control, by, a, rigid, style, of, leadership, exercising, authoritarian, discipline, and, the, most, brutal, treatment, of, occupied, areas, but, it, was, noted, that, the, japanese, far, right, organizations, lacked, a, mass, movement, similar, to, the, mass, fascist, movement, in, europe, and, some, pluralism, continued, to, exist, even, during, the, world, war, ii, stanley, g, payne, describes, japan, as, somewhat, pluralistic, authoritarian, system, which, exhibited, some, of, the, characteristics, of, fascism, but, it, did, not, develop, fascism, s, most, distinctive, and, revolutionary, aspects, and, had, more, in, common, with, the, german, empire, during, the, world, war, i, than, with, the, third, reich, it, was, also, noted, that, this, political, system, lacked, the, figure, of, a, single, person, with, an, absolute, authority, and, a, personality, cult, since, hirohito, couldn, t, be, referred, to, as, a, dictator, because, of, being, a, monarch, and, since, his, authority, existed, along, with, party, politics, while, hideki, tojo, never, had, an, absolute, authority, and, was, forced, to, resign, while, the, iraa, according, to, roger, griffin, was, little, more, than, a, bureaucratic, fiction, as, historians, noted, the, ideological, base, for, japanese, was, traditional, even, if, the, methods, of, communication, and, control, were, modern, and, european, and, that, the, traditional, society, of, japan, was, to, a, large, degree, differential, while, its, institutions, remained, too, elitist, and, conservative, to, follow, such, practices, as, a, democratic, mass, mobilization, characteristic, of, totalitarianism, in, the, early, twentieth, century, a, distinctive, style, of, architecture, was, developed, for, the, empire, now, referred, to, as, imperial, crown, style, teikan, y, shiki, before, the, end, of, world, war, ii, it, was, originally, referred, to, as, emperor, s, crown, amalgamate, style, and, sometimes, emperor, s, crown, style, teikanshiki, the, style, is, identified, by, japanese, style, roofing, on, top, of, neoclassical, styled, buildings, and, can, have, a, centrally, elevated, structure, with, a, pyramidal, dome, the, prototype, for, this, style, was, developed, by, architect, shimoda, kikutaro, in, his, proposal, for, the, imperial, diet, building, present, national, diet, building, in, 1920, although, his, proposal, was, ultimately, rejected, outside, of, the, japanese, mainland, in, places, like, taiwan, and, korea, imperial, crown, style, architecture, often, included, regional, architectural, elements, overall, during, the, 1920s, japan, changed, its, direction, toward, a, democratic, system, of, government, however, parliamentary, government, was, not, rooted, deeply, enough, to, withstand, the, economic, and, political, pressures, of, the, 1930s, during, which, military, leaders, became, increasingly, influential, these, shifts, in, power, were, made, possible, by, the, ambiguity, and, imprecision, of, the, meiji, constitution, particularly, as, regarded, the, position, of, the, emperor, in, relation, to, the, constitution, during, the, 1920s, the, whole, global, economy, was, dubbed, as, a, decade, of, global, uncertainty, at, the, same, time, the, zaibatsu, trading, groups, principally, mitsubishi, mitsui, sumitomo, and, yasuda, looked, towards, great, future, expansion, their, main, concern, was, a, shortage, of, raw, materials, prime, minister, fumimaro, konoe, combined, social, concerns, with, the, needs, of, capital, and, planned, for, expansion, their, economic, growth, was, stimulated, by, certain, domestic, policies, and, it, can, be, seen, in, the, steady, and, progressive, increase, of, materials, such, as, in, the, iron, steel, and, chemical, industry, the, main, goals, of, japan, s, expansionism, were, acquisition, and, protection, of, spheres, of, influence, maintenance, of, territorial, integrity, acquisition, of, raw, materials, and, access, to, asian, markets, western, nations, notably, the, united, kingdom, france, and, the, united, states, had, for, long, exhibited, great, interest, in, the, commercial, opportunities, in, china, and, other, parts, of, asia, these, opportunities, had, attracted, western, investment, because, of, the, availability, of, raw, materials, for, both, domestic, production, and, re, export, to, asia, japan, desired, these, opportunities, in, planning, the, development, of, the, greater, east, asia, co, prosperity, sphere, the, great, depression, just, as, in, many, other, countries, hindered, japan, s, economic, growth, the, japanese, empire, s, main, problem, lay, in, that, rapid, industrial, expansion, had, turned, the, country, into, a, major, manufacturing, and, industrial, power, that, required, raw, materials, however, these, had, to, be, obtained, from, overseas, as, there, was, a, critical, lack, of, natural, resources, on, the, home, islands, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, japan, needed, to, import, raw, materials, such, as, iron, rubber, and, oil, to, maintain, strong, economic, growth, most, of, these, resources, came, from, the, united, states, the, japanese, felt, that, acquiring, resource, rich, territories, would, establish, economic, self, sufficiency, and, independence, and, they, also, hoped, to, jump, start, the, nation, s, economy, in, the, midst, of, the, depression, as, a, result, japan, set, its, sights, on, east, asia, specifically, manchuria, with, its, many, resources, japan, needed, these, resources, to, continue, its, economic, development, and, maintain, national, integrity, in, 1931, japan, invaded, and, conquered, northeast, china, manchuria, with, little, resistance, japan, claimed, that, this, invasion, was, a, liberation, of, the, local, manchus, from, the, chinese, although, the, majority, of, the, population, were, han, chinese, as, a, result, of, the, large, scale, settlement, of, chinese, in, manchuria, in, the, 19th, century, japan, then, established, a, puppet, state, called, manchukuo, chinese, and, installed, the, last, manchu, emperor, of, china, puyi, as, the, official, head, of, state, rehe, a, chinese, territory, bordering, manchukuo, was, later, also, taken, in, 1933, this, puppet, regime, had, to, carry, on, a, protracted, pacification, campaign, against, the, anti, japanese, volunteer, armies, in, manchuria, in, 1936, japan, created, a, similar, mongolian, puppet, state, in, inner, mongolia, named, mengjiang, chinese, which, was, also, predominantly, chinese, as, a, result, of, recent, han, immigration, to, the, area, at, that, time, east, asians, were, banned, from, immigration, to, north, america, and, australia, but, the, newly, established, manchukuo, was, open, to, immigration, of, asians, japan, had, an, emigration, plan, to, encourage, colonization, the, japanese, population, in, manchuria, subsequently, grew, to, 850, 000, with, rich, natural, resources, and, labor, force, in, manchuria, army, owned, corporations, turned, manchuria, into, a, solid, material, support, machine, of, the, japanese, army, japan, invaded, china, proper, in, 1937, beginning, a, war, against, both, chiang, kai, shek, s, nationalists, and, also, the, communists, of, mao, zedong, s, united, front, on, december, 13, of, that, same, year, the, nationalist, capital, of, nanjing, surrendered, to, japanese, troops, in, the, event, known, as, the, nanjing, massacre, japanese, troops, killed, many, tens, of, thousands, of, people, associated, with, the, defending, garrison, it, is, estimated, that, as, many, as, 200, 000, to, 300, 000, including, civilians, may, have, been, killed, although, the, actual, numbers, are, uncertain, and, possibly, inflated, coupled, with, the, fact, that, the, government, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, has, never, undertaken, a, full, accounting, of, the, massacre, in, total, an, estimated, 20, million, chinese, mostly, civilians, were, killed, during, world, war, ii, a, puppet, state, was, also, set, up, in, china, quickly, afterwards, headed, by, wang, jingwei, the, second, sino, japanese, war, continued, into, world, war, ii, with, the, communists, and, nationalists, in, a, temporary, and, uneasy, nominal, alliance, against, the, japanese, in, 1938, the, japanese, 19th, division, entered, territory, claimed, by, the, soviet, union, leading, to, the, battle, of, lake, khasan, this, incursion, was, founded, in, the, japanese, belief, that, the, soviet, union, misinterpreted, the, demarcation, of, the, boundary, as, stipulated, in, the, treaty, of, peking, between, imperial, russia, and, manchu, china, and, subsequent, supplementary, agreements, on, demarcation, and, furthermore, that, the, demarcation, markers, were, tampered, with, on, may, 11, 1939, in, the, nomonhan, incident, battle, of, khalkhin, gol, a, mongolian, cavalry, unit, of, some, 70, to, 90, men, entered, the, disputed, area, in, search, of, grazing, for, their, horses, and, encountered, manchukuoan, cavalry, who, drove, them, out, two, days, later, the, mongolian, force, returned, and, the, manchukoans, were, unable, to, evict, them, the, ija, 23rd, division, and, other, units, of, the, kwantung, army, then, became, involved, joseph, stalin, ordered, stavka, the, red, army, s, high, command, to, develop, a, plan, for, a, counterstrike, against, the, japanese, in, late, august, georgy, zhukov, employed, encircling, tactics, that, made, skillful, use, of, superior, artillery, armor, and, air, forces, this, offensive, nearly, annihilated, the, 23rd, division, and, decimated, the, ija, 7th, division, on, september, 15, an, armistice, was, arranged, nearly, two, years, later, on, april, 13, 1941, the, parties, signed, a, neutrality, pact, in, which, the, soviet, union, pledged, to, respect, the, territorial, integrity, and, inviolability, of, manchukuo, while, japan, agreed, similarly, for, the, mongolian, people, s, republic, in, 1938, japan, prohibited, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, in, japan, manchuria, and, china, in, accordance, with, the, spirit, of, racial, equality, on, which, japan, had, insisted, for, many, years, the, second, sino, japanese, war, had, seen, tensions, rise, between, imperial, japan, and, the, united, states, events, such, as, the, panay, incident, and, the, nanjing, massacre, turned, american, public, opinion, against, japan, with, the, occupation, of, french, indochina, in, the, years, of, 1940, 41, and, with, the, continuing, war, in, china, the, united, states, and, its, allies, placed, embargoes, on, japan, of, strategic, materials, such, as, scrap, metal, and, oil, which, were, vitally, needed, for, the, war, effort, the, japanese, were, faced, with, the, option, of, either, withdrawing, from, china, and, losing, face, or, seizing, and, securing, new, sources, of, raw, materials, in, the, resource, rich, european, controlled, colonies, of, southeast, asia, specifically, british, malaya, and, the, dutch, east, indies, modern, day, indonesia, on, september, 27, 1940, japan, signed, the, tripartite, pact, with, germany, and, italy, their, objectives, were, to, establish, and, maintain, a, new, order, of, things, in, their, respective, world, regions, and, spheres, of, influence, with, germany, and, italy, in, europe, and, japan, in, asia, the, signatories, of, this, alliance, became, known, as, the, axis, powers, the, pact, also, called, for, mutual, protection, if, any, one, of, the, member, powers, was, attacked, by, a, country, not, already, at, war, excluding, the, soviet, union, and, for, technological, and, economic, cooperation, between, the, signatories, for, the, sake, of, their, own, people, and, nation, prime, minister, konoe, formed, the, taisei, yokusankai, imperial, rule, assistance, association, on, october, 12, 1940, as, a, ruling, party, in, japan, in, 1940, japan, celebrated, the, 2600th, anniversary, of, jimmu, s, ascension, and, built, a, monument, to, hakk, ichiu, despite, the, fact, that, all, historians, knew, jimmu, was, a, made, up, figure, in, 1941, the, japanese, government, charged, the, one, historian, who, dared, to, challenge, jimmu, s, existence, publicly, tsuda, sokichi, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, and, the, second, world, war, the, firm, iwanami, shoten, was, repeatedly, censored, because, of, its, positions, against, the, war, and, the, emperor, shigeo, iwanami, was, even, sentenced, to, two, months, in, prison, for, the, publication, of, the, banned, works, of, tsuda, s, kichi, a, sentence, which, he, did, not, serve, however, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1946, he, founded, the, newspaper, sekai, which, had, a, great, influence, in, post, war, japanese, intellectual, circles, the, early, 20th, century, historian, tsuda, s, kichi, who, put, forward, the, then, controversial, theory, that, the, kojiki, s, accounts, were, not, based, on, history, as, edo, period, kokugaku, and, state, shinto, ideology, believed, them, to, be, but, rather, propagandistic, myths, concocted, to, explain, and, legitimize, the, rule, of, the, imperial, dynasty, also, saw, susanoo, as, a, negative, figure, arguing, that, he, was, created, to, serve, as, the, rebellious, opposite, of, the, imperial, ancestress, amaterasu, a, historian, in, 20th, century, sokichi, tsuda, s, view, of, history, which, has, become, mainstream, after, the, world, war, ii, is, based, on, his, idea, many, scholars, today, also, believe, that, the, mythology, of, takamagahara, in, kojiki, was, created, by, the, ruling, class, to, make, people, believe, that, the, class, was, precious, because, they, originated, in, the, heavenly, realm, on, november, 5, 1941, yamamoto, in, his, top, secret, operation, order, no, 1, issued, to, the, combined, fleet, the, empire, of, japan, must, drive, out, britain, and, america, from, greater, east, asia, and, to, hasten, the, settlement, of, the, china, whereas, should, the, eventuality, that, britain, and, america, would, really, be, driven, out, from, the, philippines, and, dutch, east, indies, an, independent, self, supporting, economic, entity, will, be, firmly, established, mirroring, the, principle, of, the, greater, east, asia, co, prosperity, sphere, in, another, personification, facing, an, oil, embargo, by, the, united, states, as, well, as, dwindling, domestic, reserves, the, japanese, government, decided, to, execute, a, plan, developed, by, isoroku, yamamoto, to, attack, the, united, states, pacific, fleet, in, hawaii, while, the, united, states, was, neutral, and, continued, negotiating, with, japan, for, possible, peace, in, asia, the, imperial, japanese, navy, at, the, same, time, made, its, surprise, attack, on, pearl, harbor, in, honolulu, on, december, 7, 1941, as, a, result, the, u, s, battleship, fleet, was, decimated, and, almost, 2, 500, people, died, in, the, attack, that, day, the, primary, objective, of, the, attack, was, to, incapacitate, the, united, states, long, enough, for, japan, to, establish, its, long, planned, south, east, asian, empire, and, defensible, buffer, zones, the, american, public, saw, the, attack, as, barbaric, and, treacherous, and, rallied, against, the, japanese, four, days, later, adolf, hitler, of, germany, and, benito, mussolini, of, italy, declared, war, on, the, united, states, merging, the, separate, conflicts, the, united, states, entered, the, european, theatre, and, pacific, theater, in, full, force, thereby, bringing, the, united, states, to, world, war, ii, on, the, side, of, the, allies, even, as, they, launched, the, surprise, attack, on, pearl, harbor, the, japanese, were, well, aware, that, the, united, states, had, the, capability, to, mount, a, counter, offensive, against, them, however, they, believed, that, they, could, maintain, their, defensive, perimeter, and, push, back, any, attempt, by, the, british, and, americans, that, could, incur, enough, losses, to, make, the, allied, forces, consider, making, peace, on, the, basis, of, japan, s, retainment, of, the, territories, she, had, gained, following, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, the, japanese, launched, offensives, against, allied, forces, in, east, and, southeast, asia, with, simultaneous, attacks, in, british, hong, kong, british, malaya, and, the, philippines, hong, kong, surrendered, to, the, japanese, on, december, 25, in, malaya, the, japanese, overwhelmed, an, allied, army, composed, of, british, indian, australian, and, malay, forces, the, japanese, were, quickly, able, to, advance, down, the, malayan, peninsula, forcing, the, allied, forces, to, retreat, towards, singapore, the, allies, lacked, aircover, and, tanks, the, japanese, had, complete, air, superiority, the, sinking, of, hms, prince, of, wales, and, hms, repulse, on, december, 10, 1941, led, to, the, east, coast, of, malaya, being, exposed, to, japanese, landings, and, the, elimination, of, british, naval, power, in, the, area, by, the, end, of, january, 1942, the, last, allied, forces, crossed, the, strait, of, johore, and, into, singapore, on, january, 11, 1942, a, japanese, submarine, shelled, the, united, states, naval, station, at, pago, pago, in, samoa, suggesting, that, the, japanese, were, advancing, to, the, direction, of, australia, and, nearby, oceanic, regions, in, the, philippines, the, japanese, pushed, the, combined, american, filipino, force, towards, the, bataan, peninsula, and, later, the, island, of, corregidor, by, january, 1942, general, douglas, macarthur, and, president, manuel, l, quezon, were, forced, to, flee, in, the, face, of, japanese, advance, this, marked, one, of, the, worst, defeats, suffered, by, the, americans, leaving, over, 70, 000, american, and, filipino, prisoners, of, war, in, the, custody, of, the, japanese, on, february, 15, 1942, singapore, due, to, the, overwhelming, superiority, of, japanese, forces, and, encirclement, tactics, fell, to, the, japanese, causing, the, largest, surrender, of, british, led, military, personnel, in, history, an, estimated, 80, 000, australian, british, and, indian, troops, were, taken, as, prisoners, of, war, joining, 50, 000, taken, in, the, japanese, invasion, of, malaya, modern, day, malaysia, the, japanese, then, seized, the, key, oil, production, zones, of, borneo, central, java, malang, cebu, sumatra, and, dutch, new, guinea, of, the, late, dutch, east, indies, defeating, the, dutch, forces, however, allied, sabotage, had, made, it, difficult, for, the, japanese, to, restore, oil, production, to, its, pre, war, peak, the, japanese, then, consolidated, their, lines, of, supply, through, capturing, key, islands, of, the, pacific, including, guadalcanal, japanese, military, strategists, were, keenly, aware, of, the, unfavorable, discrepancy, between, the, industrial, potential, of, japan, and, the, united, states, because, of, this, they, reasoned, that, japanese, success, hinged, on, their, ability, to, extend, the, strategic, advantage, gained, at, pearl, harbor, with, additional, rapid, strategic, victories, the, japanese, command, reasoned, that, only, decisive, destruction, of, the, united, states, pacific, fleet, and, conquest, of, its, remote, outposts, would, ensure, that, the, japanese, empire, would, not, be, overwhelmed, by, america, s, industrial, might, in, april, 1942, japan, was, bombed, for, the, first, time, in, the, doolittle, raid, during, the, same, month, after, the, japanese, victory, in, the, battle, of, bataan, the, bataan, death, march, was, conducted, where, 5, 650, to, 18, 000, filipinos, died, under, the, rule, of, the, imperial, army, in, may, 1942, failure, to, decisively, defeat, the, allies, at, the, battle, of, the, coral, sea, in, spite, of, japanese, numerical, superiority, equated, to, a, strategic, defeat, for, the, japanese, this, setback, was, followed, in, june, 1942, by, the, catastrophic, loss, of, four, fleet, carriers, at, the, battle, of, midway, the, first, decisive, defeat, for, the, imperial, japanese, navy, it, proved, to, be, the, turning, point, of, the, war, as, the, navy, lost, its, offensive, strategic, capability, and, never, managed, to, reconstruct, the, critical, mass, of, both, large, numbers, of, carriers, and, well, trained, air, groups, australian, land, forces, defeated, japanese, marines, in, new, guinea, at, the, battle, of, milne, bay, in, september, 1942, which, was, the, first, land, defeat, suffered, by, the, japanese, in, the, pacific, further, victories, by, the, allies, at, guadalcanal, in, september, 1942, and, new, guinea, in, 1943, put, the, empire, of, japan, on, the, defensive, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, with, guadalcanal, in, particular, sapping, their, already, limited, oil, supplies, during, 1943, and, 1944, allied, forces, backed, by, the, industrial, might, and, vast, raw, material, resources, of, the, united, states, advanced, steadily, towards, japan, the, sixth, united, states, army, led, by, general, macarthur, landed, on, leyte, on, october, 20, 1944, the, palawan, massacre, was, committed, by, the, imperial, army, against, filipinos, in, december, 1944, in, the, subsequent, months, during, the, philippines, campaign, 1944, 45, the, allies, including, the, combined, united, states, forces, together, with, the, native, guerrilla, units, recaptured, the, philippines, by, 1944, the, allies, had, seized, or, bypassed, and, neutralized, many, of, japan, s, strategic, bases, through, amphibious, landings, and, bombardment, this, coupled, with, the, losses, inflicted, by, allied, submarines, on, japanese, shipping, routes, began, to, strangle, japan, s, economy, and, undermine, its, ability, to, supply, its, army, by, early, 1945, the, us, marines, had, wrested, control, of, the, ogasawara, islands, in, several, hard, fought, battles, such, as, the, battle, of, iwo, jima, marking, the, beginning, of, the, fall, of, the, islands, of, japan, after, securing, airfields, in, saipan, and, guam, in, the, summer, of, 1944, the, united, states, army, air, forces, conducted, an, intense, strategic, bombing, campaign, by, having, b, 29, superfortress, bombers, in, nighttime, low, altitude, incendiary, raids, burning, japanese, cities, in, an, effort, to, pulverize, japan, s, war, industry, and, shatter, its, morale, the, operation, meetinghouse, raid, on, tokyo, on, the, night, of, march, 9, 10, 1945, led, to, the, deaths, of, approximately, 120, 000, civilians, approximately, 350, 000, 500, 000, civilians, died, in, 67, japanese, cities, as, a, result, of, the, incendiary, bombing, campaign, on, japan, concurrent, with, these, attacks, japan, s, vital, coastal, shipping, operations, were, severely, hampered, with, extensive, aerial, mining, by, the, us, s, operation, starvation, regardless, these, efforts, did, not, succeed, in, persuading, the, japanese, military, to, surrender, in, mid, august, 1945, the, united, states, dropped, nuclear, weapons, on, the, japanese, cities, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, these, bombings, were, the, first, and, only, combat, use, of, nuclear, weaponry, these, two, bombs, killed, approximately, 120, 000, people, in, a, matter, of, seconds, and, as, many, as, a, result, of, nuclear, radiation, in, the, following, weeks, months, and, years, the, bombs, killed, as, many, as, 140, 000, people, in, hiroshima, and, 80, 000, in, nagasaki, by, the, end, of, 1945, at, the, yalta, agreement, the, us, the, uk, and, the, ussr, had, agreed, that, the, ussr, would, enter, the, war, on, japan, within, three, months, of, the, defeat, of, germany, in, europe, this, soviet, japanese, war, led, to, the, fall, of, japan, s, manchurian, occupation, soviet, occupation, of, south, sakhalin, island, and, a, real, imminent, threat, of, soviet, invasion, of, the, home, islands, of, japan, this, was, a, significant, factor, for, some, internal, parties, in, the, japanese, decision, to, surrender, to, the, us, and, gain, some, protection, rather, than, face, simultaneous, soviet, invasion, as, well, as, defeat, by, the, us, and, its, allies, likewise, the, superior, numbers, of, the, armies, of, the, soviet, union, in, europe, was, a, factor, in, the, us, decision, to, demonstrate, the, use, of, atomic, weapons, to, the, ussr, just, as, the, allied, victory, in, europe, was, evolving, into, the, division, of, germany, and, berlin, the, division, of, europe, with, the, iron, curtain, and, the, subsequent, cold, war, having, ignored, mokusatsu, the, potsdam, declaration, the, empire, of, japan, surrendered, and, ended, world, war, ii, after, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, the, declaration, of, war, by, the, soviet, union, and, subsequent, invasion, of, manchuria, and, other, territories, in, a, national, radio, address, on, august, 15, emperor, hirohito, announced, the, surrender, to, the, japanese, people, by, gyokuon, h, s, a, period, known, as, occupied, japan, followed, after, the, war, largely, spearheaded, by, us, army, general, douglas, macarthur, to, revise, the, japanese, constitution, and, democratized, the, nation, the, allied, occupation, including, concurrent, economic, and, political, assistance, continued, until, 1952, allied, forces, ordered, japan, to, abolish, the, meiji, constitution, and, enforce, the, 1946, constitution, of, japan, this, new, constitution, was, imposed, by, the, united, states, under, the, supervision, of, macarthur, macarthur, included, article, 9, which, changed, japan, into, a, pacifist, country, upon, adoption, of, the, 1947, constitution, the, empire, of, japan, was, dissolved, and, became, simply, the, modern, state, of, japan, with, the, formal, surrender, before, the, empire, s, territory, was, much, reduced, to, the, japanese, archipelago, mostly, the, islands, of, honshu, hokkaido, kyushu, and, shikoku, this, was, confirmed, by, the, 1951, treaty, of, san, francisco, a, peace, treaty, about, japan, the, kuril, islands, historically, belonged, to, japan, and, were, first, inhabited, by, the, ainu, people, before, coming, under, the, control, of, the, matsumae, clan, during, the, edo, period, since, 1945, kuril, has, belonged, to, the, soviet, union, and, now, russia, japan, adopted, a, parliamentary, based, political, system, and, the, role, of, the, emperor, became, symbolic, the, us, occupation, forces, were, fully, responsible, for, protecting, japan, from, external, threats, japan, only, had, a, minor, police, force, for, domestic, security, japan, was, under, the, sole, control, of, the, united, states, this, was, the, only, time, in, japanese, history, that, it, was, occupied, by, a, foreign, power, general, macarthur, later, commended, the, new, japanese, government, that, he, helped, establish, and, the, new, japanese, period, when, he, was, about, to, send, the, american, forces, to, the, korean, war, the, japanese, people, since, the, war, have, undergone, the, greatest, reformation, recorded, in, modern, history, with,
