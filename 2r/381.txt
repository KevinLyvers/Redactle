between, most, trusted, daimyos, early, in, the, edo, period, the, shogunate, viewed, the, tozama, as, the, least, likely, to, be, loyal, over, time, strategic, marriages, and, the, entrenchment, of, the, system, made, the, tozama, less, likely, to, rebel, in, the, end, however, it, was, still, the, great, tozama, of, satsuma, ch, sh, and, tosa, and, to, a, lesser, extent, saga, that, brought,
