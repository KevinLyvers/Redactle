the, black, death, was, a, bubonic, plague, pandemic, occurring, in, europe, from, 1346, to, 1353, it, was, one, of, the, most, fatal, pandemics, in, human, history, as, many, as, 50, million, people, perished, perhaps, 50, of, europe, s, 14th, century, population, the, disease, is, caused, by, the, bacterium, yersinia, pestis, and, spread, by, fleas, and, through, the, air, one, of, the, most, significant, events, in, european, history, the, black, death, had, far, reaching, population, economic, and, cultural, impacts, it, was, the, beginning, of, the, second, plague, pandemic, the, plague, created, religious, social, and, economic, upheavals, with, profound, effects, on, the, course, of, european, history, the, origin, of, the, black, death, is, disputed, genetic, analysis, suggests, the, yersinia, pestis, bacteria, evolved, about, 2, 600, years, ago, in, the, tian, shan, mountains, on, the, border, of, present, day, kyrgyzstan, and, china, the, immediate, territorial, origins, of, the, black, death, and, its, outbreak, remain, unclear, with, some, evidence, pointing, towards, central, asia, china, the, middle, east, and, europe, the, pandemic, was, reportedly, first, introduced, to, europe, during, the, siege, of, the, genoese, trading, port, of, kaffa, in, crimea, by, the, golden, horde, army, of, jani, beg, in, 1347, from, crimea, it, was, most, likely, carried, by, fleas, living, on, the, black, rats, that, travelled, on, genoese, ships, spreading, through, the, mediterranean, basin, and, reaching, north, africa, west, asia, and, the, rest, of, europe, via, constantinople, sicily, and, the, italian, peninsula, there, is, evidence, that, once, it, came, ashore, the, black, death, mainly, spread, from, person, to, person, as, pneumonic, plague, thus, explaining, the, quick, inland, spread, of, the, epidemic, which, was, faster, than, would, be, expected, if, the, primary, vector, was, rat, fleas, causing, bubonic, plague, in, 2022, it, was, discovered, that, there, was, a, sudden, surge, of, deaths, in, what, is, today, kyrgyzstan, from, the, black, death, in, the, late, 1330s, when, combined, with, genetic, evidence, this, implies, that, the, initial, spread, may, not, have, been, due, to, mongol, conquests, in, the, 14th, century, as, previously, speculated, the, black, death, was, the, second, great, natural, disaster, to, strike, europe, during, the, late, middle, ages, the, first, one, being, the, great, famine, of, 1315, 1317, and, is, estimated, to, have, killed, 30, to, 60, of, the, european, population, as, well, as, approximately, 33, of, the, population, of, the, middle, east, there, were, further, outbreaks, throughout, the, late, middle, ages, and, also, due, to, other, contributing, factors, the, crisis, of, the, late, middle, ages, the, european, population, did, not, regain, its, 14th, century, level, until, the, 16th, century, outbreaks, of, the, plague, recurred, around, the, world, until, the, early, 19th, century, european, writers, contemporary, with, the, plague, described, the, disease, in, latin, as, pestis, or, pestilentia, pestilence, epidemia, epidemic, mortalitas, mortality, in, english, prior, to, the, 18th, century, the, event, was, called, the, pestilence, or, great, pestilence, the, plague, or, the, great, death, subsequent, to, the, pandemic, the, furste, moreyn, first, murrain, or, first, pestilence, was, applied, to, distinguish, the, mid, 14th, century, phenomenon, from, other, infectious, diseases, and, epidemics, of, plague, the, 1347, pandemic, plague, was, not, referred, to, specifically, as, black, in, the, time, of, occurrence, in, any, european, language, though, the, expression, black, death, had, occasionally, been, applied, to, fatal, disease, beforehand, black, death, was, not, used, to, describe, the, plague, pandemic, in, english, until, the, 1750s, the, term, is, first, attested, in, 1755, where, it, translated, danish, den, sorte, d, d, lit, the, black, death, this, expression, as, a, proper, name, for, the, pandemic, had, been, popularized, by, swedish, and, danish, chroniclers, in, the, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, and, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, was, transferred, to, other, languages, as, a, calque, icelandic, svarti, dau, i, german, der, schwarze, tod, and, french, la, mort, noire, previously, most, european, languages, had, named, the, pandemic, a, variant, or, calque, of, the, latin, magna, mortalitas, lit, great, death, the, phrase, black, death, describing, death, as, black, is, very, old, homer, used, it, in, the, odyssey, to, describe, the, monstrous, scylla, with, her, mouths, full, of, black, death, ancient, greek, romanized, ple, oi, m, lanos, than, toio, seneca, the, younger, may, have, been, the, first, to, describe, an, epidemic, as, black, death, latin, mors, atra, but, only, in, reference, to, the, acute, lethality, and, dark, prognosis, of, disease, the, 12th, 13th, century, french, physician, gilles, de, corbeil, had, already, used, atra, mors, to, refer, to, a, pestilential, fever, febris, pestilentialis, in, his, work, on, the, signs, and, symptoms, of, diseases, de, signis, et, symptomatibus, aegritudium, the, phrase, mors, nigra, black, death, was, used, in, 1350, by, simon, de, covino, or, couvin, a, belgian, astronomer, in, his, poem, on, the, judgement, of, the, sun, at, a, feast, of, saturn, de, judicio, solis, in, convivio, saturni, which, attributes, the, plague, to, an, astrological, conjunction, of, jupiter, and, saturn, his, use, of, the, phrase, is, not, connected, unambiguously, with, the, plague, pandemic, of, 1347, and, appears, to, refer, to, the, fatal, outcome, of, disease, the, historian, cardinal, francis, aidan, gasquet, wrote, about, the, great, pestilence, in, 1893, and, suggested, that, it, had, been, some, form, of, the, ordinary, eastern, or, bubonic, plague, in, 1908, gasquet, said, use, of, the, name, atra, mors, for, the, 14th, century, epidemic, first, appeared, in, a, 1631, book, on, danish, history, by, j, i, pontanus, commonly, and, from, its, effects, they, called, it, the, black, death, vulgo, ab, effectu, atram, mortem, vocitabant, research, from, 2017, suggests, plague, first, infected, humans, in, europe, and, asia, in, the, late, neolithic, early, bronze, age, research, in, 2018, found, evidence, of, yersinia, pestis, in, an, ancient, swedish, tomb, which, may, have, been, associated, with, the, neolithic, decline, around, 3000, bce, in, which, european, populations, fell, significantly, this, y, pestis, may, have, been, different, from, more, modern, types, with, bubonic, plague, transmissible, by, fleas, first, known, from, bronze, age, remains, near, samara, the, symptoms, of, bubonic, plague, are, first, attested, in, a, fragment, of, rufus, of, ephesus, preserved, by, oribasius, these, ancient, medical, authorities, suggest, bubonic, plague, had, appeared, in, the, roman, empire, before, the, reign, of, trajan, six, centuries, before, arriving, at, pelusium, in, the, reign, of, justinian, i, in, 2013, researchers, confirmed, earlier, speculation, that, the, cause, of, the, plague, of, justinian, 541, 549, ce, with, recurrences, until, 750, was, y, pestis, this, is, known, as, the, first, plague, pandemic, in, 610, the, chinese, physician, chao, yuanfang, described, a, malignant, bubo, coming, in, abruptly, with, high, fever, together, with, the, appearance, of, a, bundle, of, nodes, beneath, the, tissue, the, chinese, physician, sun, simo, who, died, in, 652, also, mentioned, a, malignant, bubo, and, plague, that, was, common, in, lingnan, guangzhou, ole, j, rgen, benedictow, believes, that, this, indicates, it, was, an, offshoot, of, the, first, plague, pandemic, which, made, its, way, eastward, to, chinese, territory, by, around, 600, a, report, by, the, medical, faculty, of, paris, stated, that, a, conjunction, of, planets, had, caused, a, great, pestilence, in, the, air, miasma, theory, muslim, religious, scholars, taught, that, the, pandemic, was, a, martyrdom, and, mercy, from, god, assuring, the, believer, s, place, in, paradise, for, non, believers, it, was, a, punishment, some, muslim, doctors, cautioned, against, trying, to, prevent, or, treat, a, disease, sent, by, god, others, adopted, preventive, measures, and, treatments, for, plague, used, by, europeans, these, muslim, doctors, also, depended, on, the, writings, of, the, ancient, greeks, due, to, climate, change, in, asia, rodents, began, to, flee, the, dried, out, grasslands, to, more, populated, areas, spreading, the, disease, the, plague, disease, caused, by, the, bacterium, yersinia, pestis, is, enzootic, commonly, present, in, populations, of, fleas, carried, by, ground, rodents, including, marmots, in, various, areas, including, central, asia, kurdistan, west, asia, north, india, uganda, and, the, western, united, states, y, pestis, was, discovered, by, alexandre, yersin, a, pupil, of, louis, pasteur, during, an, epidemic, of, bubonic, plague, in, hong, kong, in, 1894, yersin, also, proved, this, bacterium, was, present, in, rodents, and, suggested, the, rat, was, the, main, vehicle, of, transmission, the, mechanism, by, which, y, pestis, is, usually, transmitted, was, established, in, 1898, by, paul, louis, simond, and, was, found, to, involve, the, bites, of, fleas, whose, midguts, had, become, obstructed, by, replicating, y, pestis, several, days, after, feeding, on, an, infected, host, this, blockage, starves, the, fleas, drives, them, to, aggressive, feeding, behaviour, and, causes, them, to, try, and, clear, the, blockage, via, regurgitation, resulting, in, thousands, of, plague, bacteria, flushing, into, the, feeding, site, and, infecting, the, host, the, bubonic, plague, mechanism, was, also, dependent, on, two, populations, of, rodents, one, resistant, to, the, disease, which, act, as, hosts, keeping, the, disease, endemic, and, a, second, that, lacks, resistance, when, the, second, population, dies, the, fleas, move, on, to, other, hosts, including, people, thus, creating, a, human, epidemic, definitive, confirmation, of, the, role, of, y, pestis, arrived, in, 2010, with, a, publication, in, plos, pathogens, by, haensch, et, al, they, assessed, the, presence, of, dna, rna, with, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, techniques, for, y, pestis, from, the, tooth, sockets, in, human, skeletons, from, mass, graves, in, northern, central, and, southern, europe, that, were, associated, archaeologically, with, the, black, death, and, subsequent, resurgences, the, authors, concluded, that, this, new, research, together, with, prior, analyses, from, the, south, of, france, and, germany, ends, the, debate, about, the, cause, of, the, black, death, and, unambiguously, demonstrates, that, y, pestis, was, the, causative, agent, of, the, epidemic, plague, that, devastated, europe, during, the, middle, ages, in, 2011, these, results, were, further, confirmed, with, genetic, evidence, derived, from, black, death, victims, in, the, east, smithfield, burial, site, in, england, schuenemann, et, al, concluded, in, 2011, that, the, black, death, in, medieval, europe, was, caused, by, a, variant, of, y, pestis, that, may, no, longer, exist, later, in, 2011, bos, et, al, reported, in, nature, the, first, draft, genome, of, y, pestis, from, plague, victims, from, the, same, east, smithfield, cemetery, and, indicated, that, the, strain, that, caused, the, black, death, is, ancestral, to, most, modern, strains, of, y, pestis, later, genomic, papers, have, further, confirmed, the, phylogenetic, placement, of, the, y, pestis, strain, responsible, for, the, black, death, as, both, the, ancestor, of, later, plague, epidemics, including, the, third, plague, pandemic, and, the, descendant, of, the, strain, responsible, for, the, plague, of, justinian, in, addition, plague, genomes, from, prehistory, have, been, recovered, dna, taken, from, 25, skeletons, from, 14th, century, london, showed, that, plague, is, a, strain, of, y, pestis, almost, identical, to, that, which, hit, madagascar, in, 2013, further, dna, evidence, also, proves, the, role, of, y, pestis, and, traces, the, source, to, the, tian, shan, mountains, in, kyrgyzstan, researchers, are, hampered, by, a, lack, of, reliable, statistics, from, this, period, most, work, has, been, done, on, the, spread, of, the, disease, in, england, where, estimates, of, overall, population, at, the, start, of, the, plague, vary, by, over, 100, as, no, census, was, undertaken, in, england, between, the, time, of, publication, of, the, domesday, book, of, 1086, and, the, poll, tax, of, the, year, 1377, estimates, of, plague, victims, are, usually, extrapolated, from, figures, for, the, clergy, mathematical, modelling, is, used, to, match, the, spreading, patterns, and, the, means, of, transmission, in, 2018, researchers, suggested, an, alternative, model, in, which, the, disease, was, spread, from, human, fleas, and, body, lice, to, other, people, the, second, model, claims, to, better, fit, the, trends, of, the, plague, s, death, toll, as, the, rat, flea, human, hypothesis, would, have, produced, a, delayed, but, very, high, spike, in, deaths, contradicting, historical, death, data, lars, wall, e, argued, that, these, authors, take, it, for, granted, that, simond, s, infection, model, black, rat, rat, flea, human, which, was, developed, to, explain, the, spread, of, plague, in, india, is, the, only, way, an, epidemic, of, yersinia, pestis, infection, could, spread, similarly, monica, green, has, argued, that, greater, attention, is, needed, to, the, range, of, especially, non, commensal, animals, that, might, be, involved, in, the, transmission, of, plague, archaeologist, barney, sloane, has, argued, that, there, is, insufficient, evidence, of, the, extinction, of, numerous, rats, in, the, archaeological, record, of, the, medieval, waterfront, in, london, and, that, the, disease, spread, too, quickly, to, support, the, thesis, that, y, pestis, was, spread, from, fleas, on, rats, he, argues, that, transmission, must, have, been, person, to, person, this, theory, is, supported, by, research, in, 2018, which, suggested, transmission, was, more, likely, by, body, lice, and, fleas, during, the, second, plague, pandemic, academic, debate, continues, but, no, single, alternative, explanation, for, the, plague, s, spread, has, achieved, widespread, acceptance, many, scholars, arguing, for, y, pestis, as, the, major, agent, of, the, pandemic, suggest, that, its, extent, and, symptoms, can, be, explained, by, a, combination, of, bubonic, plague, with, other, diseases, including, typhus, smallpox, and, respiratory, infections, in, addition, to, the, bubonic, infection, others, point, to, additional, septicemic, and, pneumonic, forms, of, plague, which, lengthen, the, duration, of, outbreaks, throughout, the, seasons, and, help, account, for, its, high, mortality, rate, and, additional, recorded, symptoms, in, 2014, public, health, england, announced, the, results, of, an, examination, of, 25, bodies, exhumed, in, the, clerkenwell, area, of, london, as, well, as, of, wills, registered, in, london, during, the, period, which, supported, the, pneumonic, hypothesis, currently, while, osteoarcheologists, have, conclusively, verified, the, presence, of, y, pestis, bacteria, in, burial, sites, across, northern, europe, through, examination, of, bones, and, dental, pulp, no, other, epidemic, pathogen, has, been, discovered, to, bolster, the, alternative, explanations, the, importance, of, hygiene, was, not, recognized, until, the, 19th, century, and, the, germ, theory, of, disease, until, then, streets, were, usually, unhygienic, with, live, animals, and, human, parasites, facilitating, the, spread, of, transmissible, disease, by, the, early, 14th, century, so, much, filth, had, collected, inside, urban, europe, that, french, and, italian, cities, were, naming, streets, after, human, waste, in, medieval, paris, several, street, names, were, inspired, by, merde, the, french, word, for, shit, there, were, rue, merdeux, rue, merdelet, rue, merdusson, rue, des, merdons, and, rue, merdiere, as, well, as, a, rue, du, pipi, pigs, cattle, chickens, geese, goats, and, horses, roamed, the, streets, of, medieval, london, and, paris, medieval, homeowners, were, supposed, to, police, their, housefronts, including, removing, animal, dung, but, most, urbanites, were, careless, william, e, cosner, a, resident, of, the, london, suburb, of, farringdon, without, received, a, complaint, alleging, that, men, could, not, pass, for, the, stink, horse, dung, and, horse, piss, one, irate, londoner, complained, that, the, runoff, from, the, local, slaughterhouse, had, made, his, garden, stinking, and, putrid, while, another, charged, that, the, blood, from, slain, animals, flooded, nearby, streets, and, lanes, making, a, foul, corruption, and, abominable, sight, to, all, dwelling, near, in, much, of, medieval, europe, sanitation, legislation, consisted, of, an, ordinance, requiring, homeowners, to, shout, look, out, below, three, times, before, dumping, a, full, chamber, pot, into, the, street, early, christians, considered, bathing, a, temptation, with, this, danger, in, mind, st, benedict, declared, to, those, who, are, well, and, especially, to, the, young, bathing, shall, seldom, be, permitted, st, agnes, took, the, injunction, to, heart, and, died, without, ever, bathing, according, to, a, team, of, medical, geneticists, led, by, mark, achtman, yersinia, pestis, evolved, in, or, near, china, over, 2, 600, years, ago, later, research, by, a, team, led, by, galina, eroshenko, placed, its, origins, more, specifically, in, the, tian, shan, mountains, on, the, border, between, kyrgyzstan, and, china, however, more, recent, research, notes, that, the, previous, sampling, contained, east, asian, bias, and, that, sampling, since, then, has, discovered, strains, of, y, pestis, in, the, caucasus, region, previously, thought, to, be, restricted, to, china, there, is, also, no, physical, or, specific, textual, evidence, of, the, black, death, in, 14th, century, china, as, a, result, china, s, place, in, the, sequence, of, the, plague, s, spread, is, still, debated, to, this, day, according, to, charles, creighton, records, of, epidemics, in, 14th, century, china, suggest, nothing, more, than, typhus, and, major, chinese, outbreaks, of, epidemic, disease, post, date, the, european, epidemic, by, several, years, the, earliest, chinese, descriptions, of, the, bubonic, plague, do, not, appear, until, the, 1640s, nestorian, gravesites, dating, from, 1338, to, 1339, near, issyk, kul, have, inscriptions, referring, to, plague, which, has, led, some, historians, and, epidemiologists, to, think, they, mark, the, outbreak, of, the, epidemic, this, is, supported, by, recent, direct, findings, of, y, pestis, dna, in, teeth, samples, from, graves, in, the, area, with, inscriptions, referring, to, pestilence, as, the, cause, of, death, epidemics, killed, an, estimated, 25, million, across, asia, during, the, fifteen, years, before, the, black, death, reached, constantinople, in, 1347, the, evidence, does, not, suggest, at, least, at, present, that, these, mortality, crises, were, caused, by, plague, although, some, scholars, including, mcneill, and, cao, see, the, 1333, outbreak, as, a, prelude, to, the, outbreaks, in, europe, from, the, late, 1340s, to, the, early, 1350s, scholars, of, the, yuan, and, ming, periods, remain, skeptical, about, such, an, interpretation, nonetheless, the, remarkably, high, mortality, rates, during, the, datong, mortality, should, discourage, us, from, rejecting, the, possibility, of, localized, regional, outbreaks, of, plague, in, different, parts, of, china, albeit, differing, in, scale, from, and, unrelated, to, the, pandemic, mortality, of, the, black, death, what, we, lack, is, any, indication, of, a, plague, pandemic, that, engulfed, vast, territories, of, the, yuan, empire, and, later, moved, into, western, eurasia, through, central, asia, according, to, john, norris, evidence, from, issyk, kul, indicates, a, small, sporadic, outbreak, characteristic, of, transmission, from, rodents, to, humans, with, no, wide, scale, impact, according, to, achtman, the, dating, of, the, plague, suggests, that, it, was, not, carried, along, the, silk, road, and, its, widespread, appearance, in, that, region, probably, postdates, the, european, outbreak, additionally, the, silk, road, had, already, been, heavily, disrupted, before, the, spread, of, the, black, death, western, and, middle, eastern, traders, found, it, difficult, to, trade, on, the, silk, road, by, 1325, and, impossible, by, 1340, making, its, role, in, the, spread, of, plague, less, likely, there, are, no, records, of, the, symptoms, of, the, black, death, from, mongol, sources, or, writings, from, travelers, east, of, the, black, sea, prior, to, the, crimean, outbreak, in, 1346, others, still, favor, an, origin, in, china, the, theory, of, chinese, origin, implicates, the, silk, road, the, disease, possibly, spreading, alongside, mongol, armies, and, traders, or, possibly, arriving, via, ship, however, this, theory, is, still, contested, it, is, speculated, that, rats, aboard, zheng, he, s, ships, in, the, 15th, century, may, have, carried, the, plague, to, southeast, asia, india, and, africa, research, on, the, delhi, sultanate, and, the, yuan, dynasty, shows, no, evidence, of, any, serious, epidemic, in, fourteenth, century, india, and, no, specific, evidence, of, plague, in, 14th, century, china, suggesting, that, the, black, death, may, not, have, reached, these, regions, ole, benedictow, argues, that, since, the, first, clear, reports, of, the, black, death, come, from, kaffa, the, black, death, most, likely, originated, in, the, nearby, plague, focus, on, the, northwestern, shore, of, the, caspian, sea, demographic, historians, estimate, that, china, s, population, fell, by, at, least, 15, per, cent, and, perhaps, as, much, as, a, third, between, 1340, and, 1370, this, population, loss, coincided, with, the, black, death, that, ravaged, europe, and, much, of, the, islamic, world, in, 1347, 52, however, there, is, a, conspicuous, lack, of, evidence, for, pandemic, disease, on, the, scale, of, the, black, death, in, china, at, this, time, war, and, famine, and, the, diseases, that, typically, accompanied, them, probably, were, the, main, causes, of, mortality, in, the, final, decades, of, mongol, rule, monica, green, suggests, that, other, parts, of, eurasia, outside, the, west, do, not, contain, the, same, evidence, of, the, black, death, because, there, were, actually, four, strains, of, yersinia, pestis, that, became, predominant, in, different, parts, of, the, world, mongol, records, of, illness, such, as, food, poisoning, may, have, been, referring, to, the, black, death, another, theory, is, that, the, plague, originated, near, europe, and, cycled, through, the, mediterranean, northern, europe, and, russia, before, making, its, way, to, china, other, historians, such, as, john, norris, and, ole, benedictaw, believe, the, plague, likely, originated, in, europe, or, the, middle, east, and, never, reached, china, norris, specifically, argues, for, an, origin, in, kurdistan, rather, than, central, asia, the, seventh, year, after, it, began, it, came, to, england, and, first, began, in, the, towns, and, ports, joining, on, the, seacoasts, in, dorsetshire, where, as, in, other, counties, it, made, the, country, quite, void, of, inhabitants, so, that, there, were, almost, none, left, alive, but, at, length, it, came, to, gloucester, yea, even, to, oxford, and, to, london, and, finally, it, spread, over, all, england, and, so, wasted, the, people, that, scarce, the, tenth, person, of, any, sort, was, left, alive, geoffrey, the, baker, chronicon, angliae, plague, was, reportedly, first, introduced, to, europe, via, genoese, traders, from, their, port, city, of, kaffa, in, the, crimea, in, 1347, during, a, protracted, siege, of, the, city, in, 1345, 1346, the, mongol, golden, horde, army, of, jani, beg, whose, mainly, tatar, troops, were, suffering, from, the, disease, catapulted, infected, corpses, over, the, city, walls, of, kaffa, to, infect, the, inhabitants, though, it, is, also, likely, that, infected, rats, travelled, across, the, siege, lines, to, spread, the, epidemic, to, the, inhabitants, as, the, disease, took, hold, genoese, traders, fled, across, the, black, sea, to, constantinople, where, the, disease, first, arrived, in, europe, in, summer, 1347, the, epidemic, there, killed, the, 13, year, old, son, of, the, byzantine, emperor, john, vi, kantakouzenos, who, wrote, a, description, of, the, disease, modelled, on, thucydides, s, account, of, the, 5th, century, bce, plague, of, athens, noting, the, spread, of, the, black, death, by, ship, between, maritime, cities, nicephorus, gregoras, while, writing, to, demetrios, kydones, described, the, rising, death, toll, the, futility, of, medicine, and, the, panic, of, the, citizens, the, first, outbreak, in, constantinople, lasted, a, year, but, the, disease, recurred, ten, times, before, 1400, carried, by, twelve, genoese, galleys, plague, arrived, by, ship, in, sicily, in, october, 1347, the, disease, spread, rapidly, all, over, the, island, galleys, from, kaffa, reached, genoa, and, venice, in, january, 1348, but, it, was, the, outbreak, in, pisa, a, few, weeks, later, that, was, the, entry, point, into, northern, italy, towards, the, end, of, january, one, of, the, galleys, expelled, from, italy, arrived, in, marseilles, from, italy, the, disease, spread, northwest, across, europe, striking, france, spain, portugal, and, england, by, june, 1348, then, spreading, east, and, north, through, germany, scotland, and, scandinavia, from, 1348, to, 1350, it, was, introduced, into, norway, in, 1349, when, a, ship, landed, at, ask, y, then, spread, to, bj, rgvin, modern, bergen, finally, it, spread, to, northern, russia, in, 1352, and, reached, moscow, in, 1353, plague, was, less, common, in, parts, of, europe, with, less, established, trade, relations, including, the, majority, of, the, basque, country, isolated, parts, of, belgium, and, the, netherlands, and, isolated, alpine, villages, throughout, the, continent, according, to, some, epidemiologists, periods, of, unfavorable, weather, decimated, plague, infected, rodent, populations, forcing, their, fleas, onto, alternative, hosts, inducing, plague, outbreaks, which, often, peaked, in, the, hot, summers, of, the, mediterranean, and, during, the, cool, autumn, months, of, the, southern, baltic, region, among, many, other, culprits, of, plague, contagiousness, pre, existing, malnutrition, weakened, the, immune, response, contributing, to, an, immense, decline, in, european, population, the, disease, struck, various, regions, in, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, during, the, pandemic, leading, to, serious, depopulation, and, permanent, change, in, both, economic, and, social, structures, by, autumn, 1347, plague, had, reached, alexandria, in, egypt, transmitted, by, sea, from, constantinople, via, a, single, merchant, ship, carrying, slaves, by, late, summer, 1348, it, reached, cairo, capital, of, the, mamluk, sultanate, cultural, center, of, the, islamic, world, and, the, largest, city, in, the, mediterranean, basin, the, bahriyya, child, sultan, an, nasir, hasan, fled, and, more, than, a, third, of, the, 600, 000, residents, died, the, nile, was, choked, with, corpses, despite, cairo, having, a, medieval, hospital, the, late, 13th, century, bimaristan, of, the, qalawun, complex, the, historian, al, maqrizi, described, the, abundant, work, for, grave, diggers, and, practitioners, of, funeral, rites, plague, recurred, in, cairo, more, than, fifty, times, over, the, following, one, and, a, half, centuries, during, 1347, the, disease, travelled, eastward, to, gaza, by, april, by, july, it, had, reached, damascus, and, in, october, plague, had, broken, out, in, aleppo, that, year, in, the, territory, of, modern, lebanon, syria, israel, and, palestine, the, cities, of, ascalon, acre, jerusalem, sidon, and, homs, were, all, infected, in, 1348, 1349, the, disease, reached, antioch, the, city, s, residents, fled, to, the, north, but, most, of, them, ended, up, dying, during, the, journey, within, two, years, the, plague, had, spread, throughout, the, islamic, world, from, arabia, across, north, africa, the, pandemic, spread, westwards, from, alexandria, along, the, african, coast, while, in, april, 1348, tunis, was, infected, by, ship, from, sicily, tunis, was, then, under, attack, by, an, army, from, morocco, this, army, dispersed, in, 1348, and, brought, the, contagion, with, them, to, morocco, whose, epidemic, may, also, have, been, seeded, from, the, islamic, city, of, almer, a, in, al, andalus, mecca, became, infected, in, 1348, by, pilgrims, performing, the, hajj, in, 1351, or, 1352, the, rasulid, sultan, of, the, yemen, al, mujahid, ali, was, released, from, mamluk, captivity, in, egypt, and, carried, plague, with, him, on, his, return, home, during, 1349, records, show, the, city, of, mosul, suffered, a, massive, epidemic, and, the, city, of, baghdad, experienced, a, second, round, of, the, disease, symptoms, of, the, plague, include, fever, of, 38, 41, c, 100, 106, f, headaches, painful, aching, joints, nausea, and, vomiting, and, a, general, feeling, of, malaise, left, untreated, 80, of, victims, die, within, eight, days, contemporary, accounts, of, the, pandemic, are, varied, and, often, imprecise, the, most, commonly, noted, symptom, was, the, appearance, of, buboes, or, gavocciolos, in, the, groin, neck, and, armpits, which, oozed, pus, and, bled, when, opened, boccaccio, s, description, in, men, and, women, alike, it, first, betrayed, itself, by, the, emergence, of, certain, tumours, in, the, groin, or, armpits, some, of, which, grew, as, large, as, a, common, apple, others, as, an, egg, from, the, two, said, parts, of, the, body, this, deadly, gavocciolo, soon, began, to, propagate, and, spread, itself, in, all, directions, indifferently, after, which, the, form, of, the, malady, began, to, change, black, spots, or, livid, making, their, appearance, in, many, cases, on, the, arm, or, the, thigh, or, elsewhere, now, few, and, large, now, minute, and, numerous, as, the, gavocciolo, had, been, and, still, was, an, infallible, token, of, approaching, death, such, also, were, these, spots, on, whomsoever, they, showed, themselves, this, was, followed, by, acute, fever, and, vomiting, of, blood, most, people, died, two, to, seven, days, after, initial, infection, freckle, like, spots, and, rashes, which, may, have, been, caused, by, flea, bites, were, identified, as, another, potential, sign, of, plague, lodewijk, heyligen, whose, master, cardinal, giovanni, colonna, died, of, plague, in, 1348, noted, a, distinct, form, of, the, disease, pneumonic, plague, that, infected, the, lungs, and, led, to, respiratory, problems, symptoms, include, fever, cough, and, blood, tinged, sputum, as, the, disease, progresses, sputum, becomes, free, flowing, and, bright, red, pneumonic, plague, has, a, mortality, rate, of, 90, 95, septicemic, plague, is, the, least, common, of, the, three, forms, with, an, untreated, mortality, rate, near, 100, symptoms, are, high, fevers, and, purple, skin, patches, purpura, due, to, disseminated, intravascular, coagulation, in, cases, of, pneumonic, and, particularly, septicemic, plague, the, progress, of, the, disease, is, so, rapid, that, there, would, often, be, no, time, for, the, development, of, the, enlarged, lymph, nodes, that, were, noted, as, buboes, there, are, no, exact, figures, for, the, death, toll, the, rate, varied, widely, by, locality, urban, centers, with, higher, populations, suffered, longer, periods, of, abnormal, mortality, some, estimate, that, it, may, have, killed, between, 75, 000, 000, and, 200, 000, 000, people, in, eurasia, a, study, published, in, 2022, of, pollen, samples, across, europe, from, 1250, to, 1450, was, used, to, estimate, changes, in, agricultural, output, before, and, after, the, black, death, the, authors, found, great, variability, in, different, regions, with, evidence, for, high, mortality, in, areas, of, scandinavia, france, western, germany, greece, and, central, italy, but, uninterrupted, agricultural, growth, in, central, and, eastern, europe, iberia, and, ireland, the, authors, concluded, that, the, pandemic, was, immensely, destructive, in, some, areas, but, in, others, it, had, a, far, lighter, touch, invalidates, histories, of, the, black, death, that, assume, y, pestis, was, uniformly, prevalent, or, nearly, so, across, europe, and, that, the, pandemic, had, a, devastating, demographic, impact, everywhere, the, black, death, killed, by, various, estimations, from, 25, to, 60, of, europe, s, population, robert, gottfried, writes, that, as, early, as, 1351, agents, for, pope, clement, vi, calculated, the, number, of, dead, in, christian, europe, at, 23, 840, 000, with, a, preplague, population, of, about, 75, million, clement, s, figure, accounts, for, mortality, of, 31, a, rate, about, midway, between, the, 50, mortality, estimated, for, east, anglia, tuscany, and, parts, of, scandinavia, and, the, less, than, 15, morbidity, for, bohemia, and, galicia, and, it, is, unerringly, close, to, froissart, s, claim, that, a, third, of, the, world, died, a, measurement, probably, drawn, from, st, john, s, figure, of, mortality, from, plague, in, the, book, of, revelation, a, favorite, medieval, source, of, information, ole, j, benedictow, proposes, 60, mortality, rate, for, europe, as, a, whole, based, on, available, data, with, up, to, 80, based, on, poor, nutritional, conditions, in, the, 14th, century, according, to, medieval, historian, philip, daileader, it, is, likely, that, over, four, years, 45, 50, of, the, european, population, died, of, plague, the, overwhelming, number, of, deaths, in, europe, sometimes, made, mass, burials, necessary, and, some, sites, had, hundreds, or, thousands, of, bodies, the, mass, burial, sites, that, have, been, excavated, have, allowed, archaeologists, to, continue, interpreting, and, defining, the, biological, sociological, historical, and, anthropological, implications, of, the, black, death, the, mortality, rate, of, the, black, death, in, the, 14th, century, was, far, greater, than, the, worst, 20th, century, outbreaks, of, y, pestis, plague, which, occurred, in, india, and, killed, as, much, as, 3, of, the, population, of, certain, cities, in, 1348, the, disease, spread, so, rapidly, that, nearly, a, third, of, the, european, population, perished, before, any, physicians, or, government, authorities, had, time, to, reflect, upon, its, origins, in, crowded, cities, it, was, not, uncommon, for, as, much, as, 50, of, the, population, to, die, half, of, paris, population, of, 100, 000, people, died, in, italy, the, population, of, florence, was, reduced, from, between, 110, 000, and, 120, 000, inhabitants, in, 1338, to, 50, 000, in, 1351, at, least, 60, of, the, population, of, hamburg, and, bremen, perished, and, a, similar, percentage, of, londoners, may, have, died, from, the, disease, as, well, leaving, a, death, toll, of, approximately, 62, 000, between, 1346, and, 1353, florence, s, tax, records, suggest, that, 80, of, the, city, s, population, died, within, four, months, in, 1348, before, 1350, there, were, about, 170, 000, settlements, in, germany, and, this, was, reduced, by, nearly, 40, 000, by, 1450, the, disease, bypassed, some, areas, with, the, most, isolated, areas, being, less, vulnerable, to, contagion, plague, did, not, appear, in, flanders, until, the, turn, of, the, 15th, century, and, the, impact, was, less, severe, on, the, populations, of, hainaut, finland, northern, germany, and, areas, of, poland, monks, nuns, and, priests, were, especially, hard, hit, since, they, cared, for, people, ill, with, the, plague, the, level, of, mortality, in, the, rest, of, eastern, europe, was, likely, similar, to, that, of, western, europe, in, the, first, outbreak, with, descriptions, suggesting, a, similar, effect, on, russian, towns, and, the, cycles, of, plague, in, russia, being, roughly, equivalent, in, 1382, the, physician, to, the, avignon, papacy, raimundo, chalmel, de, vinario, latin, magister, raimundus, lit, master, raymond, observed, the, decreasing, mortality, rate, of, successive, outbreaks, of, plague, in, 1347, 1348, 1362, 1371, and, 1382, in, his, treatise, on, epidemics, de, epidemica, in, the, first, outbreak, two, thirds, of, the, population, contracted, the, illness, and, most, patients, died, in, the, next, half, the, population, became, ill, but, only, some, died, by, the, third, a, tenth, were, affected, and, many, survived, while, by, the, fourth, occurrence, only, one, in, twenty, people, were, sickened, and, most, of, them, survived, by, the, 1380s, in, europe, the, plague, predominantly, affected, children, chalmel, de, vinario, recognised, that, bloodletting, was, ineffective, though, he, continued, to, prescribe, bleeding, for, members, of, the, roman, curia, whom, he, disliked, and, said, that, all, true, cases, of, plague, were, caused, by, astrological, factors, and, were, incurable, he, was, never, able, to, effect, a, cure, the, populations, of, some, italian, cities, notably, florence, did, not, regain, their, pre, 14th, century, size, until, the, 19th, century, italian, chronicler, agnolo, di, tura, recorded, his, experience, from, siena, where, plague, arrived, in, may, 1348, father, abandoned, child, wife, husband, one, brother, another, for, this, illness, seemed, to, strike, through, the, breath, and, sight, and, so, they, died, and, none, could, be, found, to, bury, the, dead, for, money, or, friendship, members, of, a, household, brought, their, dead, to, a, ditch, as, best, they, could, without, priest, without, divine, offices, great, pits, were, dug, and, piled, deep, with, the, multitude, of, dead, and, they, died, by, the, hundreds, both, day, and, night, and, as, soon, as, those, ditches, were, filled, more, were, dug, and, i, agnolo, di, tura, buried, my, five, children, with, my, own, hands, and, there, were, also, those, who, were, so, sparsely, covered, with, earth, that, the, dogs, dragged, them, forth, and, devoured, many, bodies, throughout, the, city, there, was, no, one, who, wept, for, any, death, for, all, awaited, death, and, so, many, died, that, all, believed, it, was, the, end, of, the, world, the, most, widely, accepted, estimate, for, the, middle, east, including, iraq, iran, and, syria, during, this, time, is, for, a, death, toll, of, about, a, third, of, the, population, the, black, death, killed, about, 40, of, egypt, s, population, in, cairo, with, a, population, numbering, as, many, as, 600, 000, and, possibly, the, largest, city, west, of, china, between, one, third, and, 40, of, the, inhabitants, died, within, eight, months, by, the, 18th, century, the, population, of, cairo, was, halved, from, its, numbers, in, 1347, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, black, death, like, other, outbreaks, through, history, disproportionately, affected, the, poorest, people, and, those, already, in, worse, physical, condition, than, the, wealthier, citizens, but, along, with, population, decline, from, the, pandemic, wages, soared, in, response, to, a, subsequent, labour, shortage, in, some, places, rents, collapsed, e, g, lettings, used, to, bring, in, 5, and, now, but, 1, 158, however, many, labourers, artisans, and, craftsmen, those, living, from, money, wages, alone, suffered, a, reduction, in, real, incomes, owing, to, rampant, inflation, landowners, were, also, pushed, to, substitute, monetary, rents, for, labour, services, in, an, effort, to, keep, tenants, taxes, and, tithes, became, difficult, to, collect, with, living, poor, refusing, to, cover, the, share, of, the, rich, deceased, because, many, properties, were, empty, and, unfarmed, and, because, tax, collectors, where, they, could, be, employed, refused, to, go, to, plague, spots, 158, the, trade, disruptions, in, the, mongol, empire, caused, by, the, black, death, was, one, of, the, reasons, for, its, collapse, a, study, performed, by, thomas, van, hoof, of, the, utrecht, university, suggests, that, the, innumerable, deaths, brought, on, by, the, pandemic, cooled, the, climate, by, freeing, up, land, and, triggering, reforestation, this, may, have, led, to, the, little, ice, age, renewed, religious, fervor, and, fanaticism, increased, in, the, wake, of, the, black, death, some, europeans, targeted, various, groups, such, as, jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims, lepers, and, romani, blaming, them, for, the, crisis, lepers, and, others, with, skin, diseases, such, as, acne, or, psoriasis, were, killed, throughout, europe, because, 14th, century, healers, and, governments, were, at, a, loss, to, explain, or, stop, the, disease, europeans, turned, to, astrological, forces, earthquakes, and, the, poisoning, of, wells, by, jews, as, possible, reasons, for, outbreaks, many, believed, the, epidemic, was, a, punishment, by, god, for, their, sins, and, could, be, relieved, by, winning, god, s, forgiveness, there, were, many, attacks, against, jewish, communities, in, the, strasbourg, massacre, of, february, 1349, about, 2, 000, jews, were, murdered, in, august, 1349, the, jewish, communities, in, mainz, and, cologne, were, annihilated, by, 1351, 60, major, and, 150, smaller, jewish, communities, had, been, destroyed, during, this, period, many, jews, relocated, to, poland, where, they, received, a, welcome, from, king, casimir, the, great, one, theory, that, has, been, advanced, is, that, the, black, death, s, devastation, of, florence, between, 1348, and, 1350, resulted, in, a, shift, in, the, world, view, of, people, in, 14th, century, italy, that, ultimately, led, to, the, renaissance, italy, was, particularly, badly, hit, by, the, pandemic, and, the, resulting, familiarity, with, death, may, have, caused, thinkers, to, dwell, more, on, their, lives, on, earth, rather, than, on, spirituality, and, the, afterlife, it, has, also, been, argued, that, the, black, death, prompted, a, new, wave, of, piety, manifested, in, the, sponsorship, of, religious, works, of, art, this, does, not, fully, explain, why, the, renaissance, occurred, in, italy, in, the, 14th, century, the, renaissance, s, emergence, was, most, likely, the, result, of, the, complex, interaction, of, the, above, factors, in, combination, with, an, influx, of, greek, scholars, after, the, fall, of, the, byzantine, empire, as, a, result, of, the, drastic, reduction, in, the, populace, the, value, of, the, working, class, increased, and, commoners, came, to, enjoy, more, freedom, to, answer, the, increased, need, for, labour, workers, travelled, in, search, of, the, most, favorable, position, economically, prior, to, the, emergence, of, the, black, death, the, continent, was, considered, a, feudalistic, society, composed, of, fiefs, and, city, states, frequently, managed, by, the, catholic, church, the, pandemic, completely, restructured, both, religion, and, political, forces, survivors, began, to, turn, to, other, forms, of, spirituality, and, the, power, dynamics, of, the, fiefs, and, city, states, crumbled, the, survivors, of, the, pandemic, found, not, only, that, the, prices, of, food, were, lower, but, also, that, lands, were, more, abundant, and, many, of, them, inherited, property, from, their, dead, relatives, and, this, probably, contributed, to, the, destabilization, of, feudalism, the, word, quarantine, has, its, roots, in, this, period, though, the, practice, of, isolating, people, to, prevent, the, spread, of, disease, is, older, in, the, city, state, of, ragusa, modern, dubrovnik, croatia, a, thirty, day, isolation, period, was, implemented, in, 1377, for, new, arrivals, to, the, city, from, plague, affected, areas, the, isolation, period, was, later, extended, to, forty, days, and, given, the, name, quarantino, from, the, italian, word, for, forty, all, institutions, were, affected, smaller, monasteries, and, convents, became, unviable, and, closed, up, to, half, parish, churches, lost, their, priest, apart, from, the, parishioners, religious, sensibilities, changed, looking, back, into, the, past, the, history, of, the, church, during, the, middle, ages, in, england, appears, one, continuous, and, stately, progress, it, is, much, nearer, to, the, truth, to, say, that, in, 1351, the, whole, ecclesiastical, system, was, wholly, disorganised, or, indeed, more, than, half, ruined, and, that, everything, had, to, be, built, up, anew, to, secure, the, most, necessary, public, ministrations, of, the, rites, of, religion, the, most, inadequately, prepared, subjects, had, to, be, accepted, and, even, these, could, be, obtained, only, in, insufficient, numbers, the, immediate, effect, on, the, people, was, a, religious, paralysis, instead, of, turning, men, to, god, the, scourge, turned, them, to, despair, in, time, the, religious, sense, and, feeling, revived, but, in, many, respects, it, took, a, new, tone, and, its, manifestations, ran, in, new, channels, characterised, by, a, devotional, and, more, self, reflective, cast, than, previously, the, new, religious, spirit, found, outward, expression, in, the, multitude, of, guilds, which, sprang, into, existence, at, this, time, in, the, remarkable, and, almost, as, it, may, seem, to, some, extravagant, development, of, certain, pious, practices, in, the, singular, spread, of, a, more, personal, devotion, to, the, blessed, sacrament, to, the, blessed, virgin, to, the, five, wounds, to, the, holy, name, and, other, such, manifestations, of, a, more, tender, or, more, familiar, piety, at, the, close, of, the, fourteenth, century, and, during, the, course, of, the, fifteenth, the, supply, of, ornaments, furniture, plate, statues, painted, or, in, highly, decked, coats, with, which, the, churches, were, literally, encumbered, as, time, went, on, proved, a, striking, contrast, to, the, comparative, simplicity, which, characterised, former, days, as, witnessed, by, a, comparison, of, inventories, in, fact, the, fifteenth, century, witnessed, the, beginnings, of, a, great, middle, class, movement, which, can, be, distinctly, traced, to, the, effect, of, the, great, pestilence, the, plague, repeatedly, returned, to, haunt, europe, and, the, mediterranean, throughout, the, 14th, to, 17th, centuries, according, to, jean, no, l, biraben, the, plague, was, present, somewhere, in, europe, in, every, year, between, 1346, and, 1671, although, some, researchers, have, cautions, about, the, uncritical, use, of, biraben, s, data, the, second, pandemic, was, particularly, widespread, in, the, following, years, 1360, 1363, 1374, 1400, 1438, 1439, 1456, 1457, 1464, 1466, 1481, 1485, 1500, 1503, 1518, 1531, 1544, 1548, 1563, 1566, 1573, 1588, 1596, 1599, 1602, 1611, 1623, 1640, 1644, 1654, and, 1664, 1667, subsequent, outbreaks, though, severe, marked, the, plague, s, retreat, from, most, of, europe, 18th, century, and, north, africa, 19th, century, historian, george, sussman, argued, that, the, plague, had, not, occurred, in, east, africa, until, the, 1900s, however, other, sources, suggest, that, the, second, pandemic, did, indeed, reach, sub, saharan, africa, according, to, historian, geoffrey, parker, france, alone, lost, almost, a, million, people, to, the, plague, in, the, epidemic, of, 1628, 31, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, a, plague, killed, some, 1, 7, million, people, in, italy, more, than, 1, 25, million, deaths, resulted, from, the, extreme, incidence, of, plague, in, 17th, century, spain, the, black, death, ravaged, much, of, the, islamic, world, plague, could, be, found, in, the, islamic, world, almost, every, year, between, 1500, and, 1850, sometimes, the, outbreaks, affected, small, areas, while, other, outbreaks, affected, multiple, regions, plague, repeatedly, struck, the, cities, of, north, africa, algiers, lost, 30, 000, 50, 000, inhabitants, to, it, in, 1620, 1621, and, again, in, 1654, 1657, 1665, 1691, and, 1740, 1742, cairo, suffered, more, than, fifty, plague, epidemics, within, 150, years, from, the, plague, s, first, appearance, with, the, final, outbreak, of, the, second, pandemic, there, in, the, 1840s, plague, remained, a, major, event, in, ottoman, society, until, the, second, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, between, 1701, and, 1750, thirty, seven, larger, and, smaller, epidemics, were, recorded, in, constantinople, and, an, additional, thirty, one, between, 1751, and, 1800, baghdad, has, suffered, severely, from, visitations, of, the, plague, and, sometimes, two, thirds, of, its, population, had, died, the, third, plague, pandemic, 1855, 1859, started, in, china, in, the, mid, 19th, century, spreading, to, all, inhabited, continents, and, killing, 10, million, people, in, india, alone, the, investigation, of, the, pathogen, that, caused, the, 19th, century, plague, was, begun, by, teams, of, scientists, who, visited, hong, kong, in, 1894, among, whom, was, the, french, swiss, bacteriologist, alexandre, yersin, for, whom, the, pathogen, was, named, twelve, plague, outbreaks, in, australia, between, 1900, and, 1925, resulted, in, over, 1, 000, deaths, chiefly, in, sydney, this, led, to, the, establishment, of, a, public, health, department, there, which, undertook, some, leading, edge, research, on, plague, transmission, from, rat, fleas, to, humans, via, the, bacillus, yersinia, pestis, the, first, north, american, plague, epidemic, was, the, san, francisco, plague, of, 1900, 1904, followed, by, another, outbreak, in, 1907, 1908, modern, treatment, methods, include, insecticides, the, use, of, antibiotics, and, a, plague, vaccine, it, is, feared, that, the, plague, bacterium, could, develop, drug, resistance, and, again, become, a, major, health, threat, one, case, of, a, drug, resistant, form, of, the, bacterium, was, found, in, madagascar, in, 1995, another, outbreak, in, madagascar, was, reported, in, november, 2014, in, october, 2017, the, deadliest, outbreak, of, the, plague, in, modern, times, hit, madagascar, killing, 170, people, and, infecting, thousands, an, estimate, of, the, case, fatality, rate, for, the, modern, plague, after, the, introduction, of, antibiotics, is, 11, although, it, may, be, higher, in, underdeveloped, regions, detailed, study, of, the, mortality, data, available, points, to, two, conspicuous, features, in, relation, to, the, mortality, caused, by, the, black, death, namely, the, extreme, level, of, mortality, caused, by, the, black, death, and, the, remarkable, similarity, or, consistency, of, the, level, of, mortality, from, spain, in, southern, europe, to, england, in, north, western, europe, the, data, is, sufficiently, widespread, and, numerous, to, make, it, likely, that, the, black, death, swept, away, around, 60, of, europe, s, population, the, generally, assumed, population, of, europe, at, the, time, is, about, 80, million, implying, that, around, 50, million, people, died, in, the, black, death, the, trend, of, recent, research, is, pointing, to, a, figure, more, like, 45, 50, of, the, european, population, dying, during, a, four, year, period, there, is, a, fair, amount, of, geographic, variation, in, mediterranean, europe, areas, such, as, italy, the, south, of, france, and, spain, where, plague, ran, for, about, four, years, consecutively, it, was, probably, closer, to, 75, 80, of, the, population, in, germany, and, england, it, was, probably, closer, to, 20
