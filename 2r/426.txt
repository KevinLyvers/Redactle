timeline, the, italian, wars, were, a, series, of, conflicts, fought, between, 1494, and, 1559, mostly, in, the, italian, peninsula, but, later, expanding, into, flanders, the, rhineland, and, mediterranean, sea, the, primary, belligerents, were, the, valois, kings, of, france, on, one, side, and, their, opponents, in, the, holy, roman, empire, and, spain, on, the, other, at, different, points, various, italian, states, participated, in, the, war, some, on, both, sides, with, limited, involvement, from, england, switzerland, and, the, ottoman, empire, the, italic, league, established, in, 1454, achieved, a, balance, of, power, in, italy, but, fell, apart, after, the, death, of, its, chief, architect, lorenzo, de, medici, in, 1492, combined, with, the, ambition, of, ludovico, sforza, its, collapse, allowed, charles, viii, of, france, to, invade, naples, in, 1494, which, drew, in, spain, and, the, holy, roman, empire, although, charles, was, forced, to, withdraw, in, 1495, ongoing, political, divisions, among, the, italian, states, made, them, a, battleground, in, the, struggle, for, european, domination, between, france, and, the, habsburgs, fought, with, considerable, brutality, the, wars, took, place, against, the, background, of, religious, turmoil, caused, by, the, reformation, particularly, in, france, and, the, holy, roman, empire, they, are, seen, as, a, turning, point, in, the, evolution, from, medieval, to, modern, warfare, with, the, use, of, the, arquebus, or, handgun, becoming, common, along, with, significant, technological, improvements, in, siege, artillery, literate, commanders, and, modern, printing, methods, also, make, them, one, of, the, first, conflicts, with, a, significant, number, of, contemporary, accounts, including, those, of, francesco, guicciardini, niccol, machiavelli, and, blaise, de, montluc, after, 1503, most, of, the, fighting, was, initiated, by, french, invasions, of, lombardy, and, piedmont, but, although, able, to, hold, territory, for, periods, of, time, they, could, not, do, so, permanently, by, 1557, the, growth, of, protestantism, meant, the, major, belligerents, faced, internal, conflict, over, religion, forcing, them, to, refocus, on, domestic, affairs, this, led, to, the, treaty, of, cateau, cambr, sis, under, which, france, was, largely, expelled, from, italy, but, in, exchange, gained, calais, from, england, and, the, three, bishoprics, from, lorraine, in, turn, spain, acquired, sovereignty, over, the, kingdom, of, naples, and, kingdom, of, sicily, in, southern, italy, as, well, the, duchy, of, milan, in, northern, italy, largely, driven, by, the, rivalry, between, the, republic, of, venice, and, duchy, of, milan, the, long, running, wars, in, lombardy, had, finally, been, ended, by, the, 1454, treaty, of, lodi, followed, shortly, thereafter, by, a, non, aggression, pact, known, as, the, italic, league, it, led, to, a, forty, year, period, of, stability, and, economic, expansion, marred, only, by, the, 1479, to, 1481, pazzi, conspiracy, and, 1482, to, 1484, war, of, ferrara, the, league, s, main, supporter, was, the, florentine, ruler, lorenzo, de, medici, who, also, pursued, a, policy, of, excluding, france, and, the, holy, roman, empire, from, the, italian, peninsula, lorenzo, s, death, in, april, 1492, severely, weakened, the, league, at, a, time, when, france, was, seeking, to, expand, in, italy, this, originated, when, louis, xi, of, france, inherited, the, county, of, provence, from, his, cousin, charles, iv, of, anjou, in, 1481, along, with, the, angevin, claim, to, the, kingdom, of, naples, his, son, charles, viii, succeeded, him, in, 1483, and, formally, incorporated, provence, into, france, in, 1486, its, ports, of, marseille, and, toulon, provided, direct, access, to, the, mediterranean, and, thus, the, ability, to, pursue, his, territorial, ambitions, in, the, run, up, to, the, first, italian, war, charles, sought, to, secure, the, neutrality, of, other, european, rulers, through, a, series, of, treaties, these, included, the, november, 1492, peace, of, taples, with, henry, vii, of, england, and, the, march, 1493, treaty, of, barcelona, with, maximilian, i, holy, roman, emperor, the, war, began, when, ludovico, sforza, then, regent, of, milan, encouraged, charles, viii, of, france, to, invade, italy, using, the, angevin, claim, to, the, throne, of, naples, as, a, pretext, this, in, turn, was, driven, by, the, intense, rivalry, between, ludovico, s, wife, beatrice, d, este, and, that, of, his, nephew, gian, galeazzo, sforza, husband, of, isabella, of, aragon, despite, being, the, hereditary, duke, of, milan, gian, galeazzo, had, been, sidelined, by, his, uncle, in, 1481, and, exiled, to, pavia, both, women, wanted, to, ensure, their, children, inherited, the, duchy, and, when, isabella, s, father, became, alfonso, ii, of, naples, in, january, 1494, she, asked, for, his, help, in, securing, their, rights, in, september, charles, invaded, the, peninsula, which, he, justified, by, claiming, he, wanted, to, use, naples, as, a, base, for, a, crusade, against, the, ottoman, turks, in, october, ludovico, formally, became, duke, of, milan, following, the, death, of, gian, galeazzo, who, was, popularly, supposed, to, have, been, poisoned, by, his, uncle, and, the, french, marched, through, italy, virtually, unopposed, entering, pisa, on, 8, november, florence, on, 17th, and, rome, on, 31, december, charles, was, backed, by, girolamo, savonarola, who, used, the, opportunity, to, established, a, short, lived, theocracy, in, florence, while, pope, alexander, vi, allowed, his, army, free, passage, through, the, papal, states, in, february, 1495, the, french, reached, monte, san, giovanni, campano, in, the, kingdom, of, naples, and, despatched, envoys, to, negotiate, terms, with, its, neapolitan, garrison, who, murdered, them, and, sent, their, mutilated, bodies, back, to, the, french, lines, on, 9, february, the, enraged, besiegers, breached, the, walls, of, the, castle, with, artillery, fire, then, stormed, it, killing, everyone, inside, known, as, the, sack, of, naples, widespread, outrage, within, italy, allied, with, concern, over, the, power, of, france, led, to, the, formation, of, the, league, of, venice, on, 31, march, 1495, an, anti, french, alliance, composed, of, republic, of, venice, milan, spain, and, the, holy, roman, empire, later, joined, by, florence, following, the, overthrow, of, savonarola, the, papal, states, and, mantua, this, coalition, cut, off, charles, and, his, army, from, their, bases, in, france, charles, cousin, louis, d, orleans, now, tried, to, take, advantage, of, ludovico, s, change, of, sides, to, conquer, milan, which, he, claimed, through, his, grandmother, valentina, visconti, on, 11, june, he, captured, novara, when, the, garrison, defected, and, reached, vigevano, forty, kilometres, from, milan, at, this, crucial, point, ludovico, was, incapacitated, either, by, a, stroke, or, nervous, breakdown, while, his, unpaid, soldiers, were, on, the, verge, of, mutiny, in, his, absence, his, wife, beatrice, d, este, took, personal, control, of, the, duchy, and, the, siege, of, novara, with, louis, eventually, forced, to, surrender, in, return, for, his, freedom, having, replaced, ferdinand, ii, of, naples, with, a, pro, french, government, charles, turned, north, and, on, 6, july, was, intercepted, by, the, league, outside, fornovo, di, taro, in, the, resulting, battle, of, fornovo, the, french, forced, their, opponents, back, across, the, taro, river, and, continued, onto, asti, leaving, most, of, their, supplies, behind, both, sides, claimed, victory, but, the, general, consensus, favoured, the, french, since, the, league, suffered, heavier, casualties, and, failed, to, halt, their, retreat, the, reason, for, fighting, in, the, first, place, in, the, south, despite, some, initial, reverses, by, september, 1495, ferdinand, ii, had, regained, control, of, his, kingdom, although, the, french, invasion, achieved, little, it, showed, the, italian, states, were, rich, and, comparatively, weak, making, future, intervention, attractive, to, outside, powers, charles, himself, died, on, 7, april, 1498, and, was, succeeded, by, the, former, duke, of, orleans, who, became, louis, xii, the, next, phase, of, the, conflict, originated, in, the, long, standing, rivalry, between, florence, and, the, republic, of, pisa, which, had, been, annexed, by, florence, in, 1406, but, took, advantage, of, the, french, invasion, to, regain, its, independence, in, 1494, despite, charles, retreat, in, 1495, pisa, continued, to, receive, support, from, genoa, venice, and, milan, all, of, whom, were, suspicious, of, florentine, power, in, order, to, strengthen, his, own, position, ludovico, once, again, invited, an, external, power, to, settle, an, internal, italian, affair, in, this, case, emperor, maximilian, i, in, doing, so, maximilian, hoped, to, bolster, the, league, of, venice, which, he, viewed, as, an, essential, barrier, to, french, intervention, but, florence, was, convinced, he, favoured, pisa, and, refused, to, accept, mediation, to, enforce, a, settlement, in, july, 1496, maximilian, besieged, the, florentine, city, of, livorno, but, withdrew, in, september, due, to, shortages, of, men, and, supplies, following, the, death, of, charles, viii, in, april, 1498, louis, xii, began, planning, another, attempt, on, milan, while, also, pursuing, his, predecessor, s, claim, to, the, kingdom, of, naples, aware, of, the, hostility, caused, by, french, ambitions, in, italy, in, july, 1498, he, renewed, the, 1492, peace, of, taples, with, england, and, signed, a, treaty, confirming, french, borders, with, burgundy, this, was, followed, in, august, by, the, treaty, of, marcoussis, with, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, although, it, did, not, address, outstanding, territorial, disputes, between, the, two, countries, it, agreed, have, all, enemies, in, common, except, the, pope, on, 9, february, 1499, louis, signed, the, treaty, of, blois, a, military, alliance, with, venice, against, ludovico, with, these, agreements, finalised, a, french, army, of, 27, 000, under, the, milanese, exile, gian, giacomo, trivulzio, invaded, lombardy, and, in, august, besieged, rocca, d, arazzo, a, fortified, town, in, the, western, part, of, the, duchy, of, milan, the, french, siege, artillery, breached, the, walls, in, less, than, five, hours, and, after, the, town, capitulated, louis, ordered, the, execution, of, its, garrison, and, senior, members, of, the, civil, administration, other, milanese, strongholds, surrendered, rather, than, face, the, same, fate, while, ludovico, whose, wife, beatrice, had, died, in, 1497, fled, the, duchy, with, his, children, and, took, refuge, with, maximilian, on, 6, october, 1499, louis, made, a, triumphant, entry, into, milan, florence, now, asked, for, french, assistance, in, retaking, pisa, a, request, louis, was, in, no, hurry, to, fulfil, since, they, had, refused, to, support, his, capture, of, milan, he, was, also, initially, occupied, in, defeating, efforts, to, regain, his, duchy, by, ludovico, who, was, captured, at, novaro, in, april, 1500, and, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, in, a, french, prison, however, louis, needed, to, maintain, good, relations, with, florence, whose, territory, he, would, have, to, cross, in, order, to, conquer, naples, and, on, 29, june, 1500, a, combined, franco, florentine, army, appeared, outside, pisa, once, again, the, french, artillery, quickly, opened, a, gap, in, the, walls, but, several, assaults, were, repulsed, and, the, siege, was, abandoned, on, 11, july, with, milan, firmly, in, his, control, louis, returned, to, france, and, left, the, florentines, to, blockade, pisa, which, eventually, surrendered, in, 1509, anxious, to, begin, the, conquest, of, naples, on, 11, november, he, signed, the, treaty, of, granada, with, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, an, agreement, to, divide, the, kingdom, between, the, two, since, ferdinand, had, supported, the, expulsion, of, the, french, from, naples, in, 1495, louis, hoped, these, concessions, would, allow, him, to, acquire, the, bulk, of, the, kingdom, without, an, expensive, war, his, action, was, criticised, by, contemporaries, like, niccol, machiavelli, and, modern, historians, who, argue, the, 1499, treaty, of, marcoussis, already, gave, louis, everything, he, needed, while, inviting, spain, into, naples, could, only, work, to, his, detriment, in, july, 1501, the, french, army, reached, capua, strongly, defended, by, forces, loyal, to, frederick, of, naples, it, surrendered, on, 24, july, after, a, short, siege, but, was, then, sacked, in, addition, to, the, extensive, material, destruction, many, women, were, subjected, to, mass, rape, and, estimates, of, the, dead, ranged, from, 2, 000, to, 4, 000, actions, that, caused, consternation, throughout, italy, resistance, crumbled, as, other, towns, tried, to, avoid, the, same, fate, and, on, 12, october, louis, appointed, the, duke, of, nemours, his, viceroy, in, naples, however, the, treaty, of, granada, had, left, the, ownership, of, key, neapolitan, territories, undecided, and, disputes, over, these, quickly, poisoned, relationships, between, the, two, powers, this, led, to, war, in, late, 1502, which, ended, with, the, french, being, expelled, from, naples, once, again, after, defeats, at, cerignola, on, 28, april, 1503, and, garigliano, on, 29, december, on, 18, october, 1503, pius, iii, was, replaced, by, pope, julius, ii, who, as, ruler, of, the, papal, states, was, concerned, by, venetian, power, in, northern, italy, this, fear, was, shared, by, his, home, town, of, genoa, which, also, resented, its, expulsion, from, the, po, valley, and, maximilian, whose, acquisition, of, gorizia, in, 1500, was, threatened, by, venetian, possession, of, neighbouring, friuli, milan, controlled, by, louis, xii, was, a, long, standing, opponent, of, venice, while, ferdinand, ii, now, king, of, naples, wished, to, regain, control, of, venetian, ports, on, the, southern, adriatic, coast, along, with, the, duchy, of, ferrara, julius, united, these, disparate, interests, into, the, anti, venetian, league, of, cambrai, signed, on, 10, december, 1508, although, the, french, largely, destroyed, a, venetian, army, at, agnadello, on, 14, may, 1509, maximilian, failed, to, capture, padua, and, withdrew, from, italy, now, seeing, the, power, of, louis, xii, as, the, greater, threat, in, february, 1510, pope, julius, made, peace, with, venice, followed, in, march, by, an, agreement, with, the, swiss, cantons, to, supply, him, with, 6, 000, mercenaries, after, a, year, of, fighting, in, which, louis, xii, occupied, large, parts, of, the, papal, states, in, october, 1511, julius, formed, the, anti, french, holy, league, which, included, henry, viii, of, england, maximilian, and, spain, a, french, army, defeated, the, spanish, at, ravenna, on, 11, april, 1512, but, their, leader, gaston, de, foix, was, killed, while, the, swiss, recaptured, milan, and, restored, ludovico, s, son, massimiliano, sforza, as, duke, the, members, of, the, league, then, fell, out, over, dividing, the, spoils, and, the, death, of, pope, julius, on, 20, february, 1513, left, it, without, effective, leadership, in, march, venice, and, france, formed, an, alliance, but, from, june, to, september, 1513, the, league, won, victories, at, novara, and, la, motta, in, lombardy, guinegate, in, flanders, and, flodden, in, england, despite, this, fighting, continued, in, italy, with, neither, side, able, to, gain, a, decisive, advantage, on, 1, january, 1515, louis, xii, died, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, in, law, francis, i, who, took, up, his, predecessor, s, cause, and, routed, the, swiss, at, marignano, on, 13, 14, september, 1515, combined, with, the, unpopularity, of, massiliano, sforza, victory, allowed, francis, to, retake, milan, and, the, holy, league, collapsed, as, both, spain, and, pope, leo, x, saw, little, benefit, in, fighting, on, in, the, treaty, of, noyon, signed, on, 13, august, 1516, charles, i, of, spain, acknowledged, francis, as, duke, of, milan, while, francis, passed, his, claim, to, naples, onto, charles, left, isolated, in, december, maximilian, signed, the, treaty, of, brussels, which, confirmed, french, possession, of, milan, following, the, death, of, maximilian, in, january, 1519, the, german, princes, elected, charles, i, of, spain, as, emperor, charles, v, on, 28, june, this, brought, spain, the, low, countries, and, the, holy, roman, empire, under, one, ruler, and, meant, france, was, surrounded, by, the, so, called, habsburg, ring, francis, i, had, also, been, a, candidate, for, the, imperial, throne, adding, a, personal, dimension, to, his, rivalry, with, charles, that, became, one, of, the, fundamental, conflicts, of, the, sixteenth, century, planning, an, offensive, against, habsburg, possessions, in, navarre, and, flanders, francis, first, secured, his, position, in, italy, by, agreeing, a, new, alliance, with, venice, as, leo, x, had, backed, his, candidacy, for, emperor, he, also, counted, on, papal, support, but, leo, sided, with, charles, in, return, for, his, help, against, martin, luther, and, his, proposed, reforms, to, the, catholic, church, in, november, 1521, an, imperial, papal, army, under, prospero, colonna, and, the, marquis, of, pescara, captured, milan, and, restored, francesco, sforza, as, duke, after, leo, died, in, december, adrian, vi, was, elected, pope, on, 9, january, 1522, while, a, french, attempt, to, retake, milan, was, ended, by, defeat, at, bicocca, on, 27, april, in, may, 1522, england, joined, the, imperial, alliance, and, declared, war, on, france, venice, left, the, war, in, july, 1523, while, adrian, died, in, november, and, was, succeeded, by, clement, vii, who, tried, to, negotiate, an, end, to, the, fighting, without, success, although, france, had, lost, ground, in, lombardy, and, been, invaded, by, english, imperial, and, spanish, armies, her, opponents, had, differing, objectives, and, failed, to, co, ordinate, their, attacks, since, papal, policy, was, to, prevent, either, france, or, the, empire, from, becoming, too, powerful, in, late, 1524, clement, secretly, allied, himself, with, francis, enabling, him, to, mount, another, offensive, against, milan, on, 24, february, 1525, the, french, army, suffered, a, devastating, defeat, at, pavia, in, which, francis, was, captured, and, imprisoned, in, spain, this, led, to, frantic, diplomatic, manoeuvres, to, secure, his, release, including, a, french, mission, to, suleiman, the, magnificent, asking, for, ottoman, assistance, although, suleiman, avoided, involvement, on, this, occasion, it, was, the, beginning, of, a, long, standing, if, often, unacknowledged, franco, turkish, relationship, francis, was, eventually, released, in, march, 1526, after, signing, the, treaty, of, madrid, in, which, he, renounced, french, claims, to, artois, milan, and, burgundy, once, francis, was, free, his, council, renounced, the, treaty, of, madrid, claiming, conditions, extorted, under, duress, could, not, be, considered, binding, concerned, that, imperial, power, now, posed, a, threat, to, papal, independence, on, 22, may, 1526, clement, vii, formed, the, league, of, cognac, whose, members, included, france, the, papal, states, venice, florence, and, milan, many, of, the, imperial, troops, were, close, to, mutiny, having, not, been, paid, for, months, and, the, duke, of, urbino, commander, of, the, league, army, hoped, to, take, advantage, of, this, confusion, however, he, delayed, taking, the, offensive, awaiting, additional, swiss, reinforcements, although, the, league, gained, an, easy, victory, on, 24, june, when, the, venetians, occupied, lodi, this, delay, allowed, charles, to, gather, fresh, troops, and, support, a, milanese, revolt, in, july, against, francesco, sforza, who, was, once, again, forced, into, exile, in, september, charles, financed, an, attack, on, rome, by, the, colonna, family, who, competed, with, the, rival, orsinis, for, control, of, the, city, and, clement, was, forced, to, pay, them, to, withdraw, seeking, to, recapture, milan, francis, invaded, lombardy, at, the, beginning, of, 1527, with, an, army, financed, by, henry, viii, who, hoped, thereby, to, win, papal, support, for, divorcing, his, first, wife, katherine, of, aragon, in, may, imperial, troops, many, of, whom, were, followers, of, martin, luther, sacked, rome, and, besieged, clement, in, the, castel, sant, angelo, while, urbino, and, the, league, army, sat, outside, and, failed, to, intervene, although, the, french, marched, south, to, relieve, rome, they, were, too, late, to, prevent, clement, making, peace, with, charles, v, in, november, meanwhile, venice, the, largest, and, most, powerful, of, the, italian, states, and, which, also, possessed, the, most, effective, army, now, refused, to, contribute, any, more, troops, to, the, league, weakened, by, its, losses, in, 1509, to, 1517, and, with, its, maritime, possessions, increasingly, threatened, by, the, ottomans, under, andrea, gritti, the, republic, tried, to, remain, neutral, and, after, 1529, avoided, participation, in, the, fighting, supported, by, a, genoese, fleet, in, april, 1528, a, french, expeditionary, force, besieged, naples, before, disease, forced, them, to, withdraw, in, august, both, sides, were, now, anxious, to, end, the, war, and, after, another, french, defeat, at, landriano, on, 21, june, 1529, francis, agreed, the, treaty, of, cambrai, with, charles, in, august, known, as, the, peace, of, the, ladies, because, it, was, negotiated, by, francis, s, mother, louise, of, savoy, and, charles, s, aunt, margaret, francis, recognised, charles, as, ruler, of, milan, naples, flanders, and, artois, venice, also, made, peace, leaving, only, florence, which, had, expelled, their, medici, rulers, in, 1527, at, bologna, in, the, summer, of, 1529, charles, v, was, named, king, of, italy, he, agreed, to, restore, the, medici, on, behalf, of, pope, clement, who, was, himself, a, medici, and, after, a, lengthy, siege, florence, surrendered, in, august, 1530, prior, to, 1530, interference, by, foreign, powers, in, italy, was, viewed, as, a, short, term, problem, since, they, could, not, sustain, it, over, time, for, example, french, conquests, of, naples, in, 1494, and, 1501, and, milan, in, 1499, and, 1515, were, quickly, reversed, on, the, other, hand, venice, was, generally, viewed, by, other, states, as, the, greatest, threat, because, it, was, an, italian, power, many, assumed, the, primacy, established, at, bologna, by, charles, v, in, italy, would, also, soon, pass, but, instead, it, was, the, start, of, a, long, period, of, imperial, dominance, one, factor, was, venice, s, withdrawal, from, italian, affairs, after, 1530, in, favour, of, protecting, its, maritime, empire, from, ottoman, expansion, under, the, treaty, of, cambrai, francesco, sforza, was, reinstated, as, duke, of, milan, since, he, had, no, children, it, also, stated, charles, v, would, inherit, the, duchy, on, his, death, which, occurred, on, 1, november, 1535, francis, refused, to, accept, this, arguing, milan, was, rightfully, his, along, with, genoa, and, asti, and, once, again, prepared, for, war, in, april, 1536, pro, valois, elements, in, asti, expelled, the, imperial, garrison, and, a, french, army, under, philippe, de, chabot, occupied, turin, although, they, failed, to, take, milan, in, response, a, spanish, army, invaded, provence, and, captured, aix, on, 13, august, 1536, before, withdrawing, a, fruitless, expedition, that, diverted, resources, from, italy, where, the, situation, had, become, more, serious, the, 1536, franco, ottoman, alliance, a, comprehensive, treaty, covering, a, wide, range, of, commercial, and, diplomatic, issues, also, agreed, to, a, joint, assault, on, genoa, with, french, land, forces, supported, by, an, ottoman, fleet, finding, the, garrison, of, genoa, had, recently, been, reinforced, while, a, planned, internal, uprising, failed, to, materialise, the, french, instead, occupied, the, towns, of, pinerolo, chieri, and, carmagnola, in, piedmont, fighting, continued, in, flanders, and, northern, italy, throughout, 1537, while, the, ottoman, fleet, raided, the, coastal, areas, around, naples, raising, fears, of, invasion, throughout, italy, pope, paul, iii, who, had, replaced, clement, in, 1534, grew, increasingly, anxious, to, end, the, war, and, brought, the, two, sides, together, at, nice, in, may, 1538, the, truce, of, nice, signed, on, 18, june, agreed, to, a, ten, year, halt, in, hostilities, and, left, france, in, possession, of, most, of, savoy, piedmont, and, artois, the, 1538, truce, failed, to, resolve, underlying, tensions, between, francis, who, still, claimed, milan, and, charles, who, insisted, he, comply, with, the, treaties, of, madrid, and, cambrai, their, relationship, collapsed, in, 1540, when, charles, made, his, son, philip, duke, of, milan, thus, precluding, any, possibility, it, would, revert, to, france, in, 1541, charles, made, a, disastrous, attack, on, ottoman, port, of, algiers, which, severely, weakened, his, military, and, led, suleiman, to, reactivate, his, french, alliance, with, ottoman, support, on, 12, july, 1542, francis, once, again, declared, war, on, the, holy, roman, empire, initiating, the, italian, war, of, 1542, 46, in, august, french, armies, attacked, perpignan, on, the, spanish, border, as, well, as, artois, flanders, and, luxemburg, a, valois, possession, prior, to, 1477, imperial, resistance, proved, far, more, formidable, than, expected, with, most, of, these, attacks, easily, repulsed, and, in, 1543, henry, viii, allied, with, charles, and, agreed, to, support, his, offensive, in, flanders, neither, side, made, much, progress, and, although, a, combined, franco, ottoman, fleet, under, hayreddin, barbarossa, captured, nice, on, 22, august, and, besieged, the, citadel, the, onset, of, winter, and, presence, of, a, spanish, fleet, forced, them, to, withdraw, a, joint, attack, by, christian, and, islamic, troops, on, a, christian, town, was, regarded, as, shocking, especially, when, francis, allowed, barbarossa, to, use, the, french, port, of, toulon, as, a, winter, base, on, 14, april, 1544, a, french, army, commanded, by, francis, count, of, enghien, defeated, the, imperials, at, ceresole, a, victory, of, limited, strategic, value, since, they, failed, to, make, progress, elsewhere, in, lombardy, the, imperial, position, was, further, strengthened, at, serravalle, in, june, when, alfonso, d, avalos, defeated, a, mercenary, force, led, by, the, florentine, exile, piero, strozzi, on, their, way, to, meet, enghien, an, english, army, captured, boulogne, on, 10, september, while, imperial, forces, advanced, to, within, 100, kilometres, 60, miles, of, paris, however, with, his, treasury, exhausted, and, concerned, by, ottoman, naval, strength, in, the, mediterranean, sea, on, 14, september, charles, agreed, the, treaty, of, cr, py, with, francis, which, essentially, restored, the, position, to, that, prevailing, in, 1542, the, agreement, excluded, henry, viii, whose, war, with, france, continued, until, the, two, countries, made, peace, in, 1546, and, confirmed, his, possession, of, boulogne, francis, died, on, 31, march, 1547, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, henry, ii, of, france, he, continued, attempts, to, restore, the, french, position, in, italy, encouraged, by, italian, exiles, and, his, cousin, francis, duke, of, guise, who, claimed, the, throne, of, naples, through, his, grandfather, ren, ii, duke, of, lorraine, henry, first, strengthened, his, diplomatic, position, by, reactivating, the, franco, ottoman, alliance, and, supporting, their, capture, of, tripoli, in, august, 1551, despite, his, devout, personal, catholicism, and, persecution, of, huguenot, heretics, at, home, in, january, 1552, he, signed, the, treaty, of, chambord, with, several, protestant, princes, within, the, empire, which, gave, him, control, of, the, three, bishoprics, of, toul, verdun, and, metz, following, the, outbreak, of, the, second, schmalkaldic, war, in, march, 1552, french, troops, occupied, the, three, bishoprics, and, invaded, lorraine, in, 1553, a, franco, ottoman, force, captured, the, genoese, island, of, corsica, while, supported, by, henry, s, wife, catherine, de, medici, french, backed, tuscan, exiles, seized, control, of, siena, this, brought, henry, into, conflict, with, the, ruler, of, florence, cosimo, de, medici, who, defeated, a, french, army, at, marciano, on, 2, august, 1554, although, siena, held, out, until, april, 1555, it, was, absorbed, by, florence, and, in, 1569, became, part, of, the, grand, duchy, of, tuscany, in, july, 1554, philip, ii, of, spain, became, king, of, england, through, his, marriage, to, mary, i, and, in, november, he, also, received, the, kingdoms, of, naples, and, sicily, from, his, father, who, reconfirmed, him, as, duke, of, milan, in, january, 1556, charles, formally, abdicated, as, emperor, and, split, his, possessions, the, holy, roman, empire, went, to, his, brother, ferdinand, i, while, spain, its, overseas, territories, and, the, spanish, netherlands, were, assigned, to, philip, over, the, next, century, naples, and, lombardy, became, a, major, source, of, men, and, money, for, the, spanish, army, of, flanders, during, the, 1568, to, 1648, eighty, years, war, england, entered, the, war, in, june, 1557, and, the, focus, shifted, to, flanders, where, a, spanish, army, defeated, the, french, at, st, quentin, on, 10, august, despite, this, in, january, 1558, the, french, took, calais, held, by, the, english, since, 1347, its, loss, severely, diminished, their, future, ability, to, intervene, directly, in, mainland, europe, they, also, captured, thionville, in, june, but, peace, negotiations, had, already, begun, with, henry, absorbed, by, the, internal, conflict, that, led, to, the, french, wars, of, religion, in, 1562, the, treaty, of, cateau, cambr, sis, on, 3, april, 1559, brought, the, italian, wars, to, an, end, corsica, was, returned, to, genoa, while, emmanuel, philibert, duke, of, savoy, re, established, the, savoyard, state, in, northern, italy, as, an, independent, entity, france, retained, calais, and, the, three, bishoprics, while, other, provisions, essentially, returned, the, position, to, that, prevailing, in, 1551, finally, henry, ii, and, philip, ii, agreed, to, ask, pope, pius, iv, to, recognise, ferdinand, as, emperor, and, reconvene, the, council, of, trent, the, european, balance, of, power, changed, significantly, during, the, italian, wars, the, affirmation, of, french, power, in, italy, around, 1494, brought, austria, and, spain, to, join, an, anti, french, league, that, formed, the, habsburg, ring, around, france, low, countries, aragon, castile, empire, via, dynastic, marriages, that, eventually, led, to, the, large, inheritance, of, charles, v, on, the, other, hand, the, last, italian, war, ended, with, the, division, of, the, habsburg, empire, between, the, spanish, and, austrian, habsburgs, following, the, abdication, of, charles, v, philip, ii, of, spain, was, heir, of, the, kingdoms, held, by, charles, v, in, spain, southern, italy, and, south, america, ferdinand, i, was, the, successor, of, charles, v, in, the, holy, roman, empire, extending, from, germany, to, northern, italy, and, became, suo, jure, king, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, the, habsburg, netherlands, and, the, duchy, of, milan, were, left, in, personal, union, to, the, king, of, spain, while, continuing, to, be, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, division, of, the, empire, of, charles, v, along, with, the, capture, of, the, pale, of, calais, and, the, three, bishoprics, was, a, positive, result, for, france, however, the, habsburgs, had, gained, a, position, of, primacy, in, italy, at, the, expense, of, the, french, valois, in, return, france, was, forced, to, end, opposition, to, habsburg, power, and, abandon, its, claims, in, italy, henry, ii, also, restored, the, savoyard, state, to, emmanuel, philibert, who, settled, in, piedmont, and, corsica, to, the, republic, of, genoa, for, this, reason, the, conclusion, of, the, italian, wars, for, france, is, considered, to, be, a, mixed, result, at, the, end, of, the, wars, about, half, of, italy, was, ruled, by, the, spanish, habsburgs, including, all, of, the, south, naples, sicily, sardinia, and, the, duchy, of, milan, the, other, half, of, italy, remained, independent, although, the, north, was, largely, formed, by, formal, fiefs, of, the, austrian, habsburgs, as, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, most, significant, italian, power, left, was, the, papacy, in, central, italy, as, it, maintained, major, cultural, and, political, influence, during, the, catholic, reformation, the, council, of, trent, suspended, during, the, war, was, reconvened, by, the, terms, of, the, peace, treaties, and, came, to, an, end, in, 1563, as, in, the, case, of, france, the, habsburg, result, is, also, variously, interpreted, many, historians, in, the, 20th, century, including, garrett, mattingly, eric, cochrane, and, manuel, f, alvarez, identified, the, peace, of, cateau, cambr, sis, as, the, beginning, of, a, spanish, hegemony, in, italy, however, this, view, has, been, contested, and, abandoned, in, 21st, century, historiography, christine, shaw, micheal, j, levin, and, william, reger, reject, the, concept, of, a, spanish, hegemony, on, the, ground, that, too, many, limits, prevented, spain, s, dominance, in, the, peninsula, and, maintain, that, other, powers, also, held, major, influence, in, italy, after, 1559, although, spain, gained, control, of, about, half, of, the, italian, states, the, other, half, remained, independent, among, them, the, papacy, in, particular, emerged, strengthened, by, the, conclusion, of, the, council, of, trent, according, to, the, scholars, antelantonio, spagnoletti, and, benedetto, croce, furthermore, according, to, the, historians, christine, shaw, and, salvatore, puglisi, the, holy, roman, empire, continued, to, play, a, role, in, italian, politics, peter, j, wilson, writes, that, three, overlapping, and, competing, feudal, networks, imperial, spanish, and, papal, were, affirmed, in, italy, as, a, result, of, the, end, of, the, wars, in, the, long, term, habsburg, primacy, in, italy, continued, to, exist, but, it, varied, significantly, due, to, the, change, of, dynasties, in, austria, and, spain, following, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, and, other, wars, of, succession, the, habsburg, lorraine, of, austria, largely, replaced, spain, and, gained, direct, or, indirect, control, of, the, fiefs, of, imperial, italy, whereas, the, south, eventually, passed, to, an, independent, branch, of, the, spanish, bourbons, france, would, return, in, italy, to, confront, habsburg, power, first, under, louis, xiv, and, later, under, napoleon, but, only, the, unification, of, italy, would, permanently, remove, foreign, powers, from, the, peninsula, charles, tilly, has, characterized, the, italian, wars, as, a, key, part, in, his, theory, of, state, formation, as, the, wars, demonstrated, the, value, of, large, armies, and, superior, military, technology, in, coercion, capital, and, european, states, ad, 990, 1992, tilly, argues, that, a, comprehensive, european, state, system, can, be, reasonably, dated, to, the, italian, wars, the, italian, wars, represented, a, revolution, in, military, technology, and, tactics, some, historians, suggesting, they, form, the, dividing, point, between, modern, and, medieval, battlefields, contemporary, historian, francesco, guicciardini, wrote, of, the, initial, 1494, french, invasion, that, sudden, and, violent, wars, broke, out, ending, with, the, conquest, of, a, state, in, less, time, than, it, used, to, take, to, occupy, a, villa, the, siege, and, taking, of, a, city, became, extremely, rapid, and, achieved, not, in, months, but, in, days, and, hours, infantry, underwent, profound, developments, during, the, italian, wars, evolving, from, a, primary, pike, and, halberd, wielding, force, to, a, more, flexible, arrangement, of, arquebusiers, pikemen, and, other, troops, while, landsknechts, and, swiss, mercenaries, continued, to, dominate, during, the, early, part, of, the, wars, the, italian, war, of, 1521, demonstrated, the, power, of, massed, firearms, in, pike, and, shot, formations, a, 1503, skirmish, between, french, and, spanish, forces, first, demonstrated, the, utility, of, arquebuses, in, battle, the, spanish, general, gonzalo, de, c, rdoba, faked, a, retreat, luring, a, contingent, of, french, men, at, arms, between, two, groups, of, his, arquebusiers, as, the, french, army, stepped, between, the, marksmen, volleys, of, bullets, battered, them, on, both, flanks, before, the, french, could, attack, the, vulnerable, arquebusiers, a, spanish, cavalry, charge, broke, the, french, forces, and, forced, their, retreat, while, the, french, army, escaped, the, spanish, inflicted, severe, casualties, so, successful, was, the, employment, of, firearms, in, the, italian, wars, that, niccol, machiavelli, often, characterized, as, an, enemy, of, the, use, of, the, arquebus, wrote, in, his, treatise, on, the, art, of, war, that, all, citizens, in, a, city, should, know, how, to, fire, a, gun, many, conquistadors, such, as, hern, n, cort, s, had, considered, italy, before, opting, to, serve, in, spanish, america, while, large, numbers, of, veterans, from, naples, and, southern, italy, later, emigrated, there, either, as, colonists, or, soldiers, experience, in, italy, was, often, considered, a, prerequisite, for, military, employment, although, the, chronicler, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, oviedo, y, vald, s, claimed, those, who, did, so, must, have, failed, to, become, rich, gambled, the, riches, away, or, lost, them, and, suggested, conditions, in, the, americas, were, far, tougher, francisco, sebasti, n, an, italian, veteran, who, accompanied, hernando, de, soto, on, his, expedition, into, north, america, agreed, with, this, assessment, largely, because, no, plunder, of, value, could, be, obtained, from, the, inhabitants, italian, veterans, included, diego, vel, zquez, de, cu, llar, who, conquered, cuba, in, 1511, francisco, de, carvajal, and, pedro, de, valdivia, both, of, whom, fought, at, pavia, in, 1526, carvajal, and, valdivia, served, with, the, pizarro, brothers, in, peru, during, their, conflict, with, spanish, rival, diego, de, almagro, in, 1538, carvajal, remained, with, the, pizarros, while, valdivia, began, the, conquest, of, chile, and, ignited, the, arauco, war, the, two, men, fought, on, opposite, sides, in, the, 1548, battle, of, jaquijahuana, carvajal, was, executed, after, being, taken, prisoner, while, valdivia, died, in, 1553, at, tucapel, heavy, cavalry, the, final, evolution, of, the, fully, armoured, medieval, knight, remained, significant, players, on, the, battlefields, of, the, italian, wars, largely, due, to, their, excellent, horses, french, gendarmes, were, generally, successful, against, heavy, mounted, troops, from, other, states, but, were, very, vulnerable, to, pikemen, the, spanish, used, heavy, cavalry, and, light, cavalry, or, jinetes, for, skirmishing, artillery, particularly, field, artillery, became, an, indispensable, part, of, any, first, rate, army, during, the, wars, when, charles, viii, invaded, in, 1494, he, brought, with, him, the, first, truly, mobile, siege, train, of, culverins, and, bombards, it, included, various, innovations, such, as, mounting, the, guns, on, wheeled, carriages, drawn, by, horses, rather, than, oxen, as, was, the, custom, which, allowed, them, to, be, deployed, against, an, enemy, stronghold, on, arrival, this, mobility, stemmed, from, their, lightness, achieved, by, employing, the, methods, used, to, cast, bronze, church, bells, perhaps, the, most, important, improvement, was, the, creation, of, the, iron, cannonball, rather, than, the, stone, balls, that, often, shattered, on, impact, the, combination, meant, charles, could, level, in, an, hour, castles, that, had, resisted, sieges, for, months, or, even, years, the, italian, wars, are, one, of, the, first, major, conflicts, for, which, extensive, contemporary, accounts, from, people, involved, in, the, wars, are, available, owing, largely, to, the, presence, of, literate, and, often, extremely, well, educated, commanders, the, invention, of, modern, printing, still, less, than, one, century, old, undoubtedly, played, a, large, role, in, the, memorialization, of, the, conflict, as, well, major, historians, of, the, period, include, francesco, guicciardini, and, paolo, sarpi, the, naming, of, the, component, conflicts, within, the, italian, wars, has, never, been, standardized, and, varies, among, historians, of, the, period, some, wars, may, be, split, or, combined, differently, causing, ordinal, numbering, systems, to, be, inconsistent, among, different, sources, the, wars, may, be, referred, to, by, their, dates, or, by, the, monarchs, fighting, them, usually, the, italian, wars, are, grouped, into, three, major, phases, 1494, 1516, 1521, 1530, and, 1535, 1559, a, major, contemporary, account, for, the, early, portion, of, the, italian, wars, is, francesco, guicciardini, s, storia, d, italia, history, of, italy, written, during, the, conflict, and, advantaged, by, the, access, that, guicciardini, had, to, papal, affairs
