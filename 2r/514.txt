japanese, military, leaders, in, charge, at, the, time, of, the, nanjing, massacre, were, not, tried, only, because, by, the, time, of, the, tribunals, they, had, either, already, been, killed, or, committed, seppuku, ritual, suicide, prince, asaka, as, part, of, the, imperial, family, was, granted, immunity, and, never, tried, the, massacre, remains, a, wedge, issue, in, sino, japanese,

on, july, 7, 1937, following, the, marco, polo, bridge, incident, and, rapidly, escalated, into, a, full, scale, war, in, northern, china, between, the, chinese, and, japanese, armies, the, chinese, nationalist, forces, however, wanted, to, avoid, a, decisive, conflict, in, the, northern, region, and, instead, opened, a, second, front, by, launching, offensives, against, japanese, forces, in, shanghai, in, response, japan, deployed, an, army, led, by, general, iwane, matsui, to, fight, the, chinese, forces, in, shanghai, in, august, 1937, the, japanese, army, invaded, shanghai, where, they, met, strong, resistance, and, suffered, heavy, casualties, the, battle, was, bloody, as, both, sides, faced, attrition, in, urban, hand, to, hand, combat, although, the, japanese, forces, succeeded, in, forcing, the, chinese, forces, into, retreat, the, general, staff, headquarters, in, tokyo, initially, decided, not, to, expand, the, war, because, they, wanted, the, war, to, end, however, there, was, a, significant, disagreement, between, the, japanese, government, and, its, army, in, china, matsui, had, expressed, his, intention, to, advance, on, nanjing, even, before, departing, for, shanghai, he, firmly, believed, that, capturing, nanjing, the, chinese, capital, would, lead, to, the, collapse, of, the, entire, nationalist, government, of, china, thereby, securing, a, swift, and, decisive, victory, for, japan, the, general, staff, headquarters, in, tokyo, eventually, relented, to, the, demands, of, the, imperial, japanese, army, in, china, by, approving, the, operation, to, attack, and, capture, nanjing, in, a, press, release, to, foreign, reporters, tang, shengzhi, announced, the, city, would, not, surrender, and, would, fight, to, the, death, tang, gathered, a, garrison, force, of, some, 81, 500, soldiers, many, of, whom, were, untrained, conscripts, or, troops, exhausted, from, the, battle, of, shanghai, the, chinese, government, left, for, relocation, on, december, 1, and, the, president, left, on, december, 7, leaving, the, administration, of, nanjing, to, an, international, committee, led, by, john, rabe, a, german, national, and, nazi, party, member, in, an, attempt, to, secure, permission, for, this, cease, fire, from, generalissimo, chiang, kai, shek, rabe, who, was, living, in, nanjing, and, had, been, acting, as, the, chairman, of, the, nanking, international, safety, zone, committee, boarded, the, uss, panay, pr, 5, on, december, 9, from, this, gunboat, rabe, sent, two, telegrams, the, first, was, to, chiang, through, an, american, ambassador, in, hankow, asking, that, chinese, forces, undertake, no, military, operations, within, nanjing, the, second, telegram, was, sent, through, shanghai, to, japanese, military, leaders, advocating, for, a, three, day, ceasefire, so, that, the, chinese, could, withdraw, from, the, city, the, following, day, on, december, 10, rabe, got, his, answer, from, the, generalissimo, the, american, ambassador, in, hankow, replied, that, although, he, supported, rabe, s, proposal, for, a, ceasefire, chiang, did, not, rabe, says, that, the, ambassador, also, sent, us, a, separate, confidential, telegram, telling, us, that, he, has, been, officially, informed, by, the, foreign, ministry, in, hankow, that, our, understanding, that, general, tang, agreed, to, a, three, day, armistice, and, the, withdrawal, of, his, troops, from, nanjing, is, mistaken, and, moreover, that, chiang, kai, shek, has, announced, that, he, is, not, in, a, position, to, accept, such, an, offer, this, rejection, of, the, committee, s, ceasefire, plan, in, rabe, s, mind, sealed, the, fate, of, the, city, nanjing, had, been, constantly, bombed, for, days, causing, massive, destruction, and, civilian, casualties, on, december, 11, rabe, found, that, chinese, soldiers, were, still, residing, in, areas, of, the, safety, zone, meaning, that, it, became, an, intended, target, for, japanese, attacks, despite, the, majority, being, innocent, civilians, rabe, commented, on, how, efforts, to, remove, these, chinese, troops, failed, and, japanese, soldiers, began, to, lob, grenades, into, the, refugee, zone, although, the, massacre, is, generally, described, as, having, occurred, over, a, six, week, period, after, the, fall, of, nanjing, the, crimes, committed, by, the, japanese, army, were, not, limited, to, that, period, numerous, atrocities, were, committed, as, the, japanese, army, advanced, from, shanghai, to, nanjing, including, rape, torture, arson, and, murder, the, 170, miles, between, shanghai, and, nanjing, were, transformed, into, a, nightmarish, zone, of, death, and, destruction, japanese, planes, frequently, strafed, unarmed, farmers, and, refugees, for, fun, civilians, were, subjected, to, extreme, violence, and, brutality, in, a, foreshadowing, of, the, upcoming, massacre, for, example, the, nanqiantou, hamlet, was, set, on, fire, with, many, of, its, inhabitants, locked, within, the, burning, houses, two, women, one, of, them, pregnant, were, raped, repeatedly, afterwards, the, soldiers, cut, open, the, belly, of, the, pregnant, woman, and, gouged, out, the, fetus, a, crying, two, year, old, boy, was, wrestled, from, his, mother, s, arms, and, thrown, into, the, flames, while, the, mother, and, remaining, villagers, were, bayoneted, and, thrown, into, a, creek, in, addition, jiading, was, shelled, by, japanese, forces, then, 8, 000, of, its, civilian, residents, indiscriminately, murdered, half, of, taicang, was, razed, to, the, ground, and, the, salt, and, grain, stores, looted, chinese, civilians, often, committed, suicide, such, as, two, girls, who, deliberately, drowned, themselves, near, pinghu, an, event, witnessed, by, japanese, first, lieutenant, nishizawa, benkichi, according, to, kurosu, tadanobu, of, the, 13th, division, we, d, take, all, the, men, behind, the, houses, and, kill, them, with, bayonets, and, knives, then, we, d, lock, up, the, women, and, children, in, a, single, house, and, rape, them, at, night, then, before, we, left, the, next, morning, we, d, kill, all, the, women, and, children, and, to, top, it, off, we, d, set, fire, to, the, houses, so, that, even, if, anyone, came, back, they, wouldn, t, have, a, place, to, live, according, to, one, japanese, journalist, embedded, with, imperial, forces, at, the, time, the, reason, that, the, is, advancing, to, nanjing, quite, rapidly, is, due, to, the, tacit, consent, among, the, officers, and, men, that, they, could, loot, and, rape, as, they, wish, in, his, novel, ikiteiru, heitai, living, soldiers, tatsuz, ishikawa, vividly, describes, how, the, 16th, division, of, the, shanghai, expeditionary, force, committed, atrocities, on, the, march, between, shanghai, and, nanjing, the, novel, itself, was, based, on, interviews, that, ishikawa, conducted, with, troops, in, nanjing, in, january, 1938, perhaps, the, most, notorious, atrocity, was, a, killing, contest, between, two, japanese, officers, as, reported, in, the, tokyo, nichi, nichi, shimbun, and, the, english, language, japan, advertiser, the, contest, a, race, between, the, two, officers, to, see, who, could, kill, 100, people, first, using, only, a, sword, was, covered, much, like, a, sporting, event, with, regular, updates, on, the, score, over, a, series, of, days, in, japan, the, veracity, of, the, newspaper, article, about, the, contest, was, the, subject, of, ferocious, debate, for, several, decades, starting, in, 1967, in, 2000, historian, bob, tadashi, wakabayashi, concurred, with, certain, japanese, scholars, who, had, argued, that, the, contest, was, a, concocted, story, with, the, collusion, of, the, soldiers, themselves, for, the, purpose, of, raising, the, national, fighting, spirit, in, 2005, a, tokyo, district, judge, dismissed, a, suit, by, the, families, of, the, lieutenants, stating, that, the, lieutenants, admitted, the, fact, that, they, raced, to, kill, 100, people, and, that, the, story, cannot, be, proven, to, be, clearly, false, the, judge, also, ruled, against, the, civil, claim, of, the, plaintiffs, because, the, original, article, was, more, than, 60, years, old, the, historicity, of, the, event, remains, disputed, in, japan, the, nanjing, garrison, force, set, fire, to, buildings, and, houses, in, the, areas, close, to, xiaguan, to, the, north, as, well, as, in, the, environs, of, the, eastern, and, southern, city, gates, targets, within, and, outside, of, the, city, walls, such, as, military, barracks, private, homes, the, chinese, ministry, of, communication, forests, and, even, entire, villages, were, completely, burnt, down, at, an, estimated, value, of, us, 20, 30, million, 1937, many, westerners, were, living, in, the, city, at, that, time, conducting, trade, or, on, missionary, trips, as, the, japanese, army, approached, nanjing, most, of, them, fled, the, city, leaving, 27, foreigners, five, of, these, were, journalists, who, remained, in, the, city, a, few, days, after, it, was, captured, leaving, the, city, on, december, 16, fifteen, of, the, remaining, 22, foreigners, formed, a, committee, called, the, international, committee, for, the, nanking, safety, zone, in, the, western, quarter, of, the, city, german, businessman, john, rabe, was, elected, as, its, leader, in, part, because, of, his, status, as, a, member, of, the, nazi, party, and, the, existence, of, the, german, japanese, bilateral, anti, comintern, pact, the, japanese, government, had, previously, agreed, not, to, attack, parts, of, the, city, that, did, not, contain, chinese, military, forces, and, the, members, of, the, committee, managed, to, persuade, the, chinese, government, to, move, their, troops, out, of, the, area, the, nanking, safety, zone, was, demarcated, through, the, use, of, red, cross, flags, on, december, 1, 1937, nanjing, mayor, ma, chaochun, ordered, all, chinese, citizens, remaining, in, nanjing, to, move, into, the, safety, zone, many, fled, the, city, on, december, 7, and, the, international, committee, took, over, as, the, de, facto, government, of, nanjing, minnie, vautrin, was, a, christian, missionary, who, established, ginling, girls, college, in, nanking, which, was, within, the,

the, age, of, 26, a, dane, named, bernhard, arp, sindberg, began, his, role, as, a, guard, at, a, cement, factory, in, nanjing, in, december, 1937, days, before, the, japanese, invasion, of, nanjing, as, the, massacre, began, sindberg, and, karl, gunther, a, german, colleague, converted, the, cement, factory, into, a, makeshift, refugee, camp, where, they, offered, refuge, and, medical, assistance, to, approximately, 6, 000, to, 10, 000, chinese, civilians, knowing, that, imperial, japan, was, not, hostile, towards, denmark, or, nazi, germany, thus, showing, respect, for, their, flags, sindberg, painted, a, large, danish, flag, on, the, cement, factory, roof, to, deter, the, japanese, army, from, bombing, the, factory, to, keep, japanese, troops, away, from, the, factory, he, and, gunther, strategically, placed, the, danish, flag, and, the, german, swastika, around, the, site, whenever, the, japanese, approached, the, gate, sindberg, would, display, the, danish, flag, and, step, out, to, converse, with, them, and, eventually, they, would, leave, in, a, memorandum, for, the, palace, rolls, hirohito, singled, prince, yasuhiko, asaka, out, for, censure, as, the, one,

front, three, days, later, he, met, with, division, commanders, lieutenant, generals, kesago, nakajima, and, heisuke, yanagawa, who, informed, him, that, the, japanese, troops, had, almost, completely, surrounded, 300, 000, chinese, troops, in, the, vicinity, of, nanjing, and, that, preliminary, negotiations, suggested, that, the, chinese, were, ready, to, surrender, prince, asaka, issued, an, order, to, kill, all, captives, thus, providing, official, sanction, for, the, crimes, which, took, place, during, and, after, the, battle, some, authors, record, that, prince, asaka, signed, the, order, for, japanese, soldiers, in, nanjing, to, kill, all, captives, others, assert, that, lieutenant, colonel, isamu, ch, asaka, s, aide, de, camp, sent, this, order, under, the, prince, s, sign, manual, without, the, prince, s, knowledge, or, assent, nevertheless, even, if, ch, took, the, initiative, asaka, was, nominally, the, officer, in, charge, and, gave, no, orders, to, stop, the, carnage, while, the, extent, of, prince, asaka, s, responsibility, for, the, massacre, remains, a, matter, of, debate, the, ultimate, sanction, for, the, massacre, and, the, crimes,

chinese, defenders, were, hampered, by, rising, casualties, and, japanese, strengths, in, firepower, and, numbers, combined, with, fatigue, and, a, breakdown, in, communications, the, garrison, was, gradually, overwhelmed, in, the, four, day, battle, for, the, city, and, finally, collapsed, on, the, night, of, december, 12, on, december, 12, under, heavy, artillery, fire, and, aerial, bombardment, general, tang, sheng, chi, ordered, his, men, to, retreat, conflicting, orders, and, a, breakdown, in, discipline, turned, the, events, that, followed, into, a, disaster, while, some,

12, 13, following, the, japanese, army, s, capture, of, the, remaining, gates, and, entrance, into, the, city, the, japanese, army, continued, to, encounter, sporadic, resistance, from, remaining, chinese, forces, for, several, additional, days, the, japanese, military, determined, that, they, needed, to, eliminate, any, remaining, chinese, soldiers, hidden, within, the, city, however, the, search, process, used, an, arbitrary, criteria, for, identifying, former, chinese, soldiers, chinese, males, who, were, deemed, to, be, in, good, health, were, automatically, presumed, to, be, a, soldier, during, this, operation, japanese, forces, committed, atrocities, against, the, chinese, population, the, rounding, up, and, mass, killings, of, male, civilians, and, captured, pows, were, referred, to, euphemistically, as, mopping, up, operations, in, japanese, communiqu, s, in, a, manner, just, like, the, germans, were, to, talk, about, processing, or, handling, jews, with, the, relocation, of, the, capital, of, china, constant, bombing, raids, and, reports, of, japanese, brutality, much, of, nanjing, s, civilian, population, had, fled, out, of, fear, wealthy, families, were, the, first, to, flee, leaving, nanjing, in, automobiles, followed, by, the, evacuation, of, the, middle, class, and, then, the, poor, those, that, remained, were, mainly, the, destitute, lowest, class, such, as, the, ethnic, tanka, boat, people, and, those, with, assets, that, could, not, be, easily, moved, like, shopkeepers, of, nanjing, s, population, estimated, to, over, one, million, before, the, japanese, invasion, half, had, fled, nanjing, before, the, japanese, arrived, from, december, 13, 1937, the, japanese, army, engaged, in, random, murder, torture, wartime, rape, looting, arson, and, other, war, crimes, such, crime, continued, from, three, to, six, weeks, depending, on, the, types, of, crime, the, first, three, weeks, were, more, intense, a, group, of, foreign, expatriates, headed, by, rabe, had, formed, a, 15, man, international, committee, for, the, nanking, safety, zone, on, november, 22, and, mapped, out, the, nanking, safety, zone, in, order, to, safeguard, civilians, in, the, city, in, a, diary, entry, from, minnie, vautrin, on, december, 15, 1937, she, wrote, about, her, experiences, in, the, safety, zone, the, japanese, have, looted, widely, yesterday, and, today, have, destroyed, schools, have, killed, citizens, and, raped, women, one, thousand, disarmed, chinese, soldiers, whom, the, international, committee, hoped, to, save, were, taken, from, them, and, by, this, time, are, probably, shot, or, bayoneted, in, our, south, hill, house, japanese, broke, the, panel, of, the, storeroom, and, took, out, some, old, fruit, juice, and, a, few, other, things, the, nanjing, massacre, s, occurrence, and, nature, were, influenced, by, several, factors, these, included, the, dehumanization, of, japanese, soldiers, by, their, commanders, and, the, challenging, combat, environment, in, china, also, the, japanese, population, was, taught, militaristic, and, racist, ideologies, the, japanese, government, s, fascist, doctrine, further, propagated, the, belief, in, japanese, superiority, over, all, other, peoples, the, nanjing, massacre, happened, during, japan, s, invasion, of, china, the, extreme, cruelty, witnessed, in, nanjing, including, extensive, killing, torture, sexual, violence, and, looting, was, not, an, isolated, occurrence, but, rather, a, reflection, of, japan, s, behavior, throughout, the, war, in, china, this, violence, cannot, be, separated, from, the, underlying, contempt, for, other, asians, that, was, deeply, ingrained, in, japanese, society, before, the, war, to, demonstrate, the, profound, effects, of, ethnic, prejudice, japanese, author, tsuda, michio, gives, an, example, during, the, war, in, south, china, a, japanese, sergeant, who, had, raped, and, killed, numerous, chinese, women, became, impotent, as, soon, as, he, found, out, to, his, shock, that, one, of, his, victims, was, actually, a, japanese, woman, who, had, married, a, chinese, man, and, emigrated, to, china, shiro, azuma, a, former, japanese, soldier, testified, in, a, 1998, interview, when, i, tried, to, cut, off, the, first, one, either, the, farmer, moved, or, i, mis, aimed, i, ended, up, slicing, off, just, part, of, his, skull, blood, spurted, upwards, i, swung, again, and, this, time, i, killed, him, we, were, taught, that, we, were, a, superior, race, since, we, lived, only, for, the, sake, of, a, human, god, our, emperor, but, the, chinese, were, not, so, we, held, nothing, but, contempt, for, them, there, were, many, rapes, and, the, women, were, always, killed, when, they, were, being, raped, the, women, were, human, but, once, the, rape, was, finished, they, became, pig, s, flesh, jonathan, spence, a, british, american, sinologist, and, historian, wrote, here, is, no, obvious, explanation, for, this, grim, event, nor, can, one, be, found, the, japanese, soldiers, who, had, expected, easy, victory, instead, had, been, fighting, hard, for, months, and, had, taken, infinitely, higher, casualties, than, anticipated, they, were, bored, angry, frustrated, tired, the, chinese, women, were, undefended, their, menfolk, powerless, or, absent, the, war, still, undeclared, had, no, clear, cut, goal, or, purpose, perhaps, all, chinese, regardless, of, sex, or, age, seemed, marked, out, as, victims, jennifer, m, dixon, associate, professor, in, the, department, of, political, science, at, villanova, university, stated, in, addition, the, battle, of, shanghai, which, preceded, the, capture, of, nanjing, was, more, difficult, and, prolonged, than, the, japanese, side, had, anticipated, which, contributed, to, a, desire, among, japanese, officers, and, soldiers, to, exact, revenge, on, the, chinese, prime, minister, fumimaro, konoe, who, presided, over, the, second, sino, japanese, war, justified, the, massacre, as, retaliation, against, persistent, kuomintang, aggression, and, advocated, for, the, regime, s, destruction, in, january, 1938, prior, to, the, fall, of, nanjing, konoe, rejected, chiang, kai, shek, s, offer, of, negotiation, through, a, german, ambassador, in, 1937, the, osaka, mainichi, shimbun, and, its, sister, newspaper, the, tokyo, nichi, nichi, shimbun, covered, a, contest, between, two, japanese, officers, toshiaki, mukai, and, tsuyoshi, noda, of, the, japanese, 16th, division, the, two, men, were, described, as, vying, to, be, the, first, to, kill, 100, people, with, a, sword, before, the, capture, of, nanjing, from, jurong, to, tangshan, two, cities, in, jiangsu, province, china, mukai, had,

brutality, and, bestiality, of, the, japanese, soldiers, in, a, documentary, film, about, the, nanjing, massacre, in, the, name, of, the, emperor, a, former, japanese, soldier, named, shiro, azuma, spoke, candidly, about, the, process, of, rape, and, murder, in, nanjing, at, first, we, used, some, kinky, words, like, pikankan, pi, means, hip, kankan, means, look, pikankan, means, let, s, see, a, woman, open, up, her, legs, chinese, women, didn, t, wear, under, pants, instead, they, wore, trousers, tied, with, a, string, there, was, no, belt, as, we, pulled, the, string, the, buttocks, were, exposed, we, pikankan, we, looked, after, a, while, we, would, say, something, like, it, s, my, day, to, take, a, bath, and, we, took, turns, raping, them, it, would, be, all, right, if, we, only, raped, them, i, shouldn, t, say, all, right, but, we, always, stabbed, and, killed, them, because, dead, bodies, don, t, talk, iris, chang, author, of, the, book, rape, of, nanjing, wrote, one, of, the, most, comprehensive, accounts, of, japanese, war, atrocities, in, china, in, her, book, she, estimated, that, the, number, of, chinese, women, raped, by, japanese, soldiers, ranged, from, 20, 000, to, 80, 000, chang, also, states, that, not, all, rape, victims, were, women, some, chinese, men, were, sodomized, and, forced, to, perform, repulsive, sex, acts, there, are, also, accounts, of, japanese, troops, coercing, families, into, committing, incestuous, acts, sons, were, forced, to, rape, their, mothers, fathers, their, daughters, and, brothers, their, sisters, other, family, members, would, be, forced, to, look, on, instead, of, punishing, the, japanese, troops, who, were, responsible, for, wholesale, rape, the, japanese, expeditionary, force, in, central, china, issued, an, order, to, set, up, comfort, houses, during, this, period, of, time, yoshimi, yoshiaki, a, prominent, history, professor, at, chuo, university, observes, because, japan, was, afraid, of, criticism, from, china, the, united, states, of, america, and, europe, following, the, case, of, massive, rapes, between, battles, in, shanghai, and, nanjing, for, about, three, weeks, since, december, 13, 1937, the, imperial, japanese, army, entered, the, nanking, safety, zone, to, search, for, former, chinese, soldiers, hidden, among, refugees, many, innocent, men, were, misidentified, and, killed, john, rabe, summarized, the, behavior, of, japanese, troops, in, nanjing, in, his, diaries, i, ve, written, several, times, in, this, diary, about, the, body, of, the, chinese, soldier, who, was, shot, while, tied, to, his, bamboo, bed, and, who, is, still, lying, unburied, near, my, house, my, protests, and, pleas, to, the, japanese, embassy, finally, to, get, this, corpse, buried, or, give, me, permission, to, bury, it, have, thus, far, been, fruitless, the, body, is, still, lying, in, the, same, spot, as, before, except, that, the, ropes, have, been, cut, and, the, bamboo, bed, is, now, lying, about, two, yards, away, i, am, totally, puzzled, by, the, conduct, of, the, japanese, in, this, matter, on, the, one, hand, they, want, to, be, recognized, and, treated, as, a, great, power, on, a, par, with, european, powers, on, the, other, they, are, currently, displaying, a, crudity, brutality, and, bestiality, that, bears, no, comparison, except, with, the, hordes, of, genghis, khan, i, have, stopped, trying, to, get, the, poor, devil, buried, but, i, hereby, record, that, he, though, very, dead, still, lies, above, the, earth, the, death, toll, of, civilians, is, difficult, to, precisely, calculate, due, to, the, many, bodies, deliberately, burnt, buried, in, mass, graves, or, dumped, into, the, yangtze, river, robert, o, wilson, a, physician, testified, that, cases, of, gun, wounds, continued, to, come, in, for, a, matter, of, some, six, or, seven, weeks, following, the, fall, of, the, city, on, december, 13, 1937, the, capacity, of, the, hospital, was, normally, one, hundred, and, eighty, beds, and, this, was, kept, full, to, overflowing, during, this, entire, period, bradley, campbell, described, the, nanjing, massacre, as, a, genocide, given, the, fact, that, residents, were, still, slaughtered, en, masse, during, the, aftermath, despite, the, successful, and, certain, outcome, in, battle, however, jean, louis, margolin, does, not, believe, that, the, nanjing, atrocities, should, be, considered, a, genocide, because, only, prisoners, of, war, were, executed, in, a, systematic, manner, and, the, targeting, of, civilians, was, sporadic, and, done, without, orders, by, individual, actors, on, 13, december, 1937, john, rabe, wrote, in, his, diary, it, is, not, until, we, tour, the, city, that, we, learn, the, extent, of, destruction, we, come, across, corpses, every, 100, to, 200, yards, the, bodies, of, civilians, that, i, examined, had, bullet, holes, in, their, backs, these, people, had, presumably, been, fleeing, and, were, shot, from, behind, the, japanese, march, through, the, city, in, groups, of, ten, to, twenty, soldiers, and, loot, the, shops, i, watched, with, my, own, eyes, as, they, looted, the, caf, of, our, german, baker, herr, kiessling, hempel, s, hotel, was, broken, into, as, well, as, almost, every, shop, on, chung, shang, and, taiping, road, american, vice, consul, james, espy, arrived, in, nanjing, on, january, 6, 1938, to, reopen, the, american, embassy, he, gave, a, summarized, description, of, what, happened, in, the, city, the, picture, that, they, painted, of, nanking, was, one, of, a, reign, of, terror, that, befell, the, city, upon, its, occupation, by, the, japanese, military, forces, their, stories, and, those, of, the, german, residents, tell, of, the, city, having, fallen, into, the, hands, of, the, japanese, as, captured, prey, not, merely, taken, in, the, course, of, organized, warfare, but, seized, by, an, invading, army, whose, members, seemed, to, have, set, upon, the, prize, to, commit, unlimited, depredations, and, violence, fuller, data, and, our, own, observations, have, not, brought, out, facts, to, discredit, their, information, the, civilian, chinese, population, remaining, in, the, city, crowded, the, streets, of, the, so, called, safety, zone, as, refugees, many, of, whom, are, destitute, physical, evidences, are, almost, everywhere, to, the, killing, of, men, women, and, children, of, the, breaking, into, and, looting, of, property, and, of, the, burning, and, destruction, of, houses, and, buildings, it, remains, however, the, japanese, soldiers, swarmed, over, the, city, in, thousands, and, committed, untold, depredations, and, atrocities, it, would, seem, according, to, stories, told, us, by, foreign, witnesses, that, the, soldiers, were, let, loose, like, a, barbarian, horde, to, desecrate, the, city, men, women, and, children, were, killed, in, uncounted, numbers, throughout, the, city, stories, are, heard, of, civilians, being, shot, or, bayoneted, for, no, apparent, reason, on, 10, february, 1938, legation, secretary, of, the, german, embassy, georg, rosen, wrote, to, his, foreign, ministry, about, a, film, made, in, december, by, reverend, john, magee, to, recommend, its, purchase, during, the, japanese, reign, of, terror, in, nanjing, which, by, the, way, continues, to, this, day, to, a, considerable, degree, the, reverend, john, magee, a, member, of, the, american, episcopal, church, mission, who, has, been, here, for, almost, a, quarter, of, a, century, took, motion, pictures, that, eloquently, bear, witness, to, the, atrocities, committed, by, the, japanese, one, will, have, to, wait, and, see, whether, the, highest, officers, in, the, japanese, army, succeed, as, they, have, indicated, in, stopping, the, activities, of, their, troops, which, continue, even, today, on, december, 13, about, 30, soldiers, came, to, a, chinese, house, at, no, 5, hsing, lu, koo, in, the,

afterwards, and, a, cane, was, rammed, in, her, vagina, the, younger, girl, was, bayoneted, also, but, was, spared, the, horrible, treatment, that, had, been, meted, out, to, her, sister, and, mother,

woman, the, soldier, thought, he, might, as, well, rape, her, before, killing, her, so, he, pulled, her, out, of, the, group, to, a, spot, about, ten, meters, away, as, he, was, trying, to, rape, her, the, woman, resisted, fiercely, the, soldier, abruptly, stabbed, her, in, the, belly, with, a, bayonet, she, gave, a, final, scream, as, her, intestines, spilled, out, then, the, soldier, stabbed, the, fetus, with, its, umbilical, cord, clearly, visible, and, tossed, it, aside, according, to, navy, veteran, sho, mitani, the, army, used, a, trumpet, sound, that, meant, kill, all, chinese, who, run, away, thousands, were, led, away, and, mass, executed, in, an, excavation, known, as, the, ten, thousand, corpse, ditch, a, trench, measuring, about, 300, m, long, and, 5, m, wide, since,

certain, japanese, units, exercised, restraint, and, that, certain, japanese, officers, tempered, power, with, generosity, and, commission, but, continued, the, conduct, of, the, japanese, army, as,

destruction, to, areas, outside, the, city, walls, soldiers, pillaged, from, the, poor, and, the, wealthy, alike, the, lack, of, resistance, from, chinese, troops, and, civilians, in, nanjing, meant, that, the, japanese, soldiers, were, free, to, divide, up, the, city, s, valuables, as, they, saw, fit, this, resulted, in, widespread, looting, and, burglary, on, 17, december, chairman, john, rabe, wrote, a, complaint, to, kiyoshi, fukui, second, secretary, of, the, japanese, embassy, the, following, is, an, excerpt, in, other, words, on, the, 13th, when, your, troops, entered, the, city, we, had, nearly, all, the, civilian, population, gathered, in, a, zone, in, which, there, had, been, very, little, destruction, by, stray, shells, and, no, looting, by, chinese, soldiers, even, in, full, retreat, all, 27, occidentals, in, the, city, at, that, time, and, our, chinese, population, were, totally, surprised, by, the, reign, of, robbery, raping, and, killing, initiated, by, your, soldiers, on, the, 14th, all, we, are, asking, in, our, protest, is, that, you, restore, order, among, your, troops, and, get, the, normal, city, life, going, as, soon, as, possible, in, the, latter, process, we, are, glad, to, cooperate, in, any, way, we, can, but, even, last, night, between, 8, and, 9, p, m, when, five, occidental, members, of, our, staff, and, committee, toured, the, zone, to, observe, conditions, we, did, not, find, any, single, japanese, patrol, either, in, the, zone, or, at, the, entrances, the, japanese, troops, did, respect, the, zone, to, an, extent, until, the, japanese, occupation, no, shells, entered, that, part, of, the, city, except, a, few, stray, shots, during, the, chaos, following, the, attack, of, the, city, some, were, killed, in, the, safety, zone, but, the, crimes, that, occurred, in, the, rest, of, the, city, were, far, greater, by, all, accounts, rabe, wrote, that, from, time, to, time, the, japanese, would, enter, the, safety, zone, at, will, carry, off, a, few, hundred, men, and, women, and, either, summarily, execute, them, or, rape, and, then, kill, them, by, february, 5, 1938, the, international, committee, for, the, nanking, safety,

and, filed, complaints, with, the, japanese, embassy, on, december, 18, 1937, as, general, iwane, matsui, began, to, comprehend, the, full, extent, of, the, rape, torture, murder, and, looting, in, the, city, he, grew, increasingly, dismayed, he, reportedly, told, one, of, his, civilian, aides, i, now, realize, that, we, have, unknowingly, wrought, a, most, grievous, effect, on, this, city, when, i, think, of, the, feelings, and, sentiments, of, many, of, my, chinese, friends, who, have, fled, from, nanjing, and, of, the, future, of, the, two, countries, i, cannot, but, feel, depressed, i, am, very, lonely, and, can, never, get, in, a, mood, to, rejoice, about, this, victory, i, personally, feel, sorry, for, the, tragedies, to, the, people, but, the, army, must, continue, unless, china, repents, now, in, the, winter, the, season, gives, time, to, reflect, i, offer, my, sympathy, with, deep, emotion, to, a, million, innocent, people, on, new, year, s, day, over, a, toast, he, confided, to, a, japanese, diplomat, my, men, have, done, something, very, wrong, and, extremely, regrettable, matsui, blamed, the, atrocities, on, the, moral, decline, of, the, japanese, army, saying, the, nanjing, incident, was, a, terrible, disgrace, immediately, after, the, memorial, services, i, assembled, the, higher, officers, and, wept, tears, of, anger, before, them, as, commander, in, chief, i, told, them, that, after, all, our, efforts, to, enhance, the, imperial, prestige, everything, had, been, lost, in, one, moment, through, the, brutalities, of, the, soldiers, and, can, you, imagine, it, even, after, that, these, officers, laughed, at, me, i, am, really, therefore, quite, happy, that, i, at, least, should, have, ended, this, way, in, the, sense, that, it, may, serve, to, urge, self, reflection, on, many, more, members, of, the, military, of, that, time, in, late, january, 1938, the, japanese, army, forced, all, refugees, in, the, safety, zone, to, return, home, immediately, claiming, to, have, restored, order, after, the, establishment, of, the, weixin, zhengfu, the, collaborating, government, in, 1938, order, was, gradually, restored, in, nanjing, and, atrocities, by, japanese, troops, lessened, considerably, on, 18, february, 1938, the, international, committee, for, the, nanking, safety, zone, was, forcibly, renamed, the, nanjing, international, rescue, committee, and, the, safety, zone, effectively, ceased, to, function, the, last, refugee, camps, were, closed, in, may, 1938, in, february, 1938, both, prince, asaka, and, general, matsui, were, recalled, to, japan, matsui, returned, to, retirement, but, prince, asaka, remained, on, the, supreme, war, council, until, the, end, of, the, war, in, august, 1945, he, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, general, in, august, 1939, though, he, held, no, further, military, commands, the, japanese, either, destroyed, or, concealed, important, documents, severely, reducing, the, amount, of, evidence, available, for, confiscation, between, the, declaration, of, a, ceasefire, on, august, 15, 1945, and, the, arrival, of, american, troops, in, japan, on, august, 28, the, japanese, military, and, civil, authorities, systematically, destroyed, military, naval, and, government, archives, much, of, which, was, from, the, period, 1942, 1945, overseas, troops, in, the, pacific, and, east, asia, were, ordered, to, destroy, incriminating, evidence, of, war, crimes, approximately, 70, percent, of, the, japanese, army, s, wartime, records, were, destroyed, in, regards, to, the, nanjing, massacre, japanese, authorities, deliberately, concealed, wartime, records, eluding, confiscation, from, american, authorities, some, of, the, concealed, information, was, made, public, a, few, decades, later, for, example, a, two, volume, collection, of, military, documents, related, to, the, nanjing, operations, was, published, in, 1989, and, disturbing, excerpts, from, kesago, nakajima, s, diary, a, commander, at, nanjing, was, published, in, the, early, 1980s, during, his, time, in, china, bernhard, arp, sindberg, an, amateur, photographer, and, friend, to, several, foreign, journalists, always, had, his, camera, with, him, taking, graphic, photos, of, the, civilian, massacres, and, extensive, destruction, sindberg, smuggled, the, unprocessed, film, out, of, china, with, the, help, of, his, company, and, had, entrusted, the, development, of, the, film, to, his, colleagues, after, the, war, he, retrieved, his, photos, producing, one, of, the, few, photographic, records, documenting, the, nanjing, massacre, ono, kenji, a, chemical, worker, in, japan, curated, a, collection, of, wartime, diaries, from, japanese, veterans, who, fought, in, the, battle, of, nanking, in, 1937, in, 1994, nearly, 20, diaries, in, his, collection, were, published, which, became, an, important, source, of, evidence, for, the, massacre, official, war, journals, and, diaries, were, also, published, by, kaikosha, an, organization, of, retired, japanese, military, veterans, in, 1984, in, an, attempt, to, refute, japanese, war, crimes, in, nanjing, kaikosha, the, japanese, army, veterans, association, interviewed, former, japanese, soldiers, who, had, served, in, the, nanjing, area, from, 1937, to, 1938, instead, of, refuting, the, massacre, the, interviewed, veterans, confirmed, that, a, massacre, had, taken, place, and, openly, described, and, admitted, to, taking, part, in, the, atrocities, in, 1985, the, interviews, were, published, in, the, association, s, magazine, kaiko, along, with, an, admission, and, apology, that, read, whatever, the, severity, of, war, or, special, circumstances, of, war, psychology, we, just, lose, words, faced, with, this, mass, illegal, killing, as, those, who, are, related, to, the, prewar, military, we, simply, apologize, deeply, to, the, people, of, china, it, was, truly, a, regrettable, act, of, barbarity, in, early, 1980s, after, interviewing, chinese, survivors, and, reviewing, japanese, records, japanese, journalist, honda, katsuichi, concluded, that, the, nanjing, massacre, was, not, an, isolated, case, and, that, japanese, atrocities, against, the, chinese, were, common, throughout, the, lower, yangtze, river, since, the, battle, of, shanghai, the, diaries, of, other, japanese, combatants, and, medics, who, fought, in, china, have, corroborated, his, conclusions, numerous, factors, complicate, the, estimation, of, an, accurate, death, toll, according, to, american, historian, edward, j, drea, while, the, germans, beginning, in, 1943, did, engage, in, substantial, efforts, to, obliterate, evidence, of, such, crimes, as, mass, murder, and, they, destroyed, a, great, deal, of, potentially, incriminating, records, in, 1945, a, great, deal, survived, in, part, because, not, each, one, of, the, multiple, copies, had, been, burned, the, situation, was, different, in, japan, between, the, announcement, of, a, ceasefire, on, august, 15, 1945, and, the, arrival, of, small, advance, parties, of, american, troops, in, japan, on, august, 28, japanese, military, and, civil, authorities, systematically, destroyed, military, naval, and, government, archives, much, of, which, was, from, the, period, 1942, 1945, imperial, general, headquarters, in, tokyo, dispatched, enciphered, messages, to, field, commands, throughout, the, pacific, and, east, asia, ordering, units, to, burn, incriminating, evidence, of, war, crimes, especially, offenses, against, prisoners, of, war, according, to, yang, daqing, professor, of, history, and, international, affairs, at, george, washington, university, while, it, is, standard, practice, for, governments, to, destroy, evidence, in, times, of, defeat, in, the, two, weeks, before, the, allies, arrived, in, japan, various, japanese, agencies, the, military, in, particular, systematically, destroyed, sensitive, documents, to, a, degree, perhaps, unprecedented, in, history, estimates, of, the, impact, of, the, destruction, vary, tanaka, hiromi, a, professor, at, japan, s, national, defense, academy, who, has, conducted, extensive, research, into, remaining, imperial, japanese, army, and, navy, documents, in, japan, and, overseas, claims, that, less, than, 0, 1, percent, of, the, material, ordered, for, destruction, survived, in, 2003, the, director, of, japan, s, military, history, archives, of, national, institute, for, defense, studies, said, that, as, much, 70, percent, of, japan, s, wartime, records, were, destroyed, other, factors, include, the, mass, disposal, of, chinese, corpses, by, japanese, soldiers, the, revisionist, tendencies, of, both, chinese, and, japanese, individuals, and, groups, who, are, driven, by, nationalistic, and, political, motivations, and, the, subjectivity, involved, in, the, collection, and, interpretation, of, evidence, however, the, most, credible, scholars, in, japan, which, include, a, large, number, of, authoritative, academics, support, the, validity, of, the, international, military, tribunal, for, the, far, east, and, its, findings, which, estimate, more, than, 100, 000, if, broadly, defined, casualties, historian, tokushi, kasahara, states, more, than, 100, 000, and, close, to, 200, 000, or, maybe, more, with, the, emergence, of, more, information, and, data, he, said, that, there, is, a, possibility, that, the, death, toll, could, be, higher, hiroshi, yoshida, concludes, more, than, 200, 000, in, his, book, tomio, hora, supports, the, information, found, in, the, international, military, tribunal, for, the, far, east, which, estimates, a, death, toll, of, at, least, 200, 000, an, estimate, death, toll, of, 300, 000, has, also, been, cited, according, to, the, international, military, tribunal, for, the, far, east, estimates, made, at, a, later, date, indicate, that, the, total, number, of, civilians, and, prisoners, of, war, murdered, in, nanjing, and, its, vicinity, during, the, first, six, weeks, of, the, japanese, occupation, was, over, 200, 000, these, estimates, are, borne, out, by, the, figures, of, burial, societies, and, other, organizations, which, testify, to, over, 155, 000, buried, bodies, these, figures, also, do, not, take, into, account, those, persons, whose, bodies, were, destroyed, by, burning, drowning, or, other, means, or, whose, bodies, were, interred, in, mass, graves, the, most, credible, scholars, in, japan, which, include, a, large, number, of, authoritative, academics, support, the, validity, of, the, tribunal, and, its, findings, according, to, the, verdict, of, the, nanjing, war, crimes, tribunal, on, 10, march, 1947, there, are, more, than, 190, 000, mass, slaughtered, civilians, and, chinese, soldiers, killed, by, machine, gun, by, the, japanese, army, whose, corpses, have, been, burned, to, destroy, proof, besides, we, count, more, than, 150, 000, victims, of, barbarian, acts, buried, by, the, charity, organizations, we, thus, have, a, total, of, more, than, 300, 000, victims, john, rabe, chairman, of, the, international, committee, for, the, nanking, safety, zone, estimated, that, between, 50, 000, and, 60, 000, civilians, were, killed, however, erwin, wickert, the, editor, of, the, diaries, of, john, rabe, points, out, that, it, is, likely, that, rabe, s, estimate, is, too, low, since, he, could, not, have, had, an, overview, of, the, entire, municipal, area, during, the, period, of, the, worst, atrocities, moreover, many, troops, of, captured, chinese, soldiers, were, led, out, of, the, city, and, down, to, the, yangtze, where, they, were, summarily, executed, but, as, noted, no, one, actually, counted, the, dead, harold, timperley, a, journalist, in, china, during, the, japanese, invasion, reported, that, at, least, 300, 000, chinese, civilians, were, killed, in, nanjing, and, elsewhere, and, tried, to, send, a, telegram, but, was, censored, by, the, japanese, military, in, shanghai, other, sources, including, iris, chang, s, the, rape, of, nanjing, also, conclude, that, the, death, toll, reached, 300, 000, in, december, 2007, newly, declassified, u, s, government, archive, documents, revealed, that, a, telegraph, by, the, u, s, ambassador, to, germany, in, berlin, sent, one, day, after, the, japanese, army, occupied, nanjing, stated, that, he, heard, the, japanese, ambassador, in, germany, boasting, that, the, japanese, army, had, killed, 500, 000, chinese, soldiers, and, civilians, as, the, japanese, army, advanced, from, shanghai, to, nanjing, according, to, the, archives, research, the, telegrams, sent, by, the, u, s, diplomats, pointed, to, the, massacre, of, an, estimated, half, a, million, people, in, shanghai, suzhou, jiaxing, hangzhou, shaoxing, wuxi, and, changzhou, according, to, documents, in, the, unesco, memory, of, the, world, register, at, least, 300, 000, chinese, were, killed, the, duration, of, the, incident, is, naturally, defined, by, its, geography, the, earlier, the, japanese, entered, the, area, the, longer, the, duration, the, battle, of, nanking, ended, on, december, 13, when, the, divisions, of, the, japanese, army, entered, the, walled, city, of, nanjing, the, tokyo, war, crime, tribunal, defined, the, period, of, the, massacre, to, the, ensuing, six, weeks, more, conservative, estimates, say, that, the, massacre, started, on, december, 14, when, the, troops, entered, the, safety, zone, and, that, it, lasted, for, six, weeks, historians, who, define, the, nanjing, massacre, as, having, started, from, the, time, that, the, japanese, army, entered, jiangsu, province, push, the, beginning, of, the, massacre, to, around, mid, november, to, early, december, suzhou, fell, on, november, 19, and, extended, the, end, of, the, massacre, to, late, march, 1938, to, many, japanese, scholars, post, war, estimations, were, distorted, by, victor, s, justice, when, japan, was, condemned, as, the, sole, aggressor, they, believed, the, 300, 000, toll, typified, a, chinese, style, exaggeration, with, disregard, for, evidence, yet, in, china, this, figure, has, come, to, symbolize, the, justice, legality, and, authority, of, the, post, war, trials, condemning, japan, as, the, aggressor, shortly, after, the, surrender, of, japan,

accepts, the, findings, of, the, tokyo, trials, and, concludes, that, there, were, at, least, 200, 000, casualties, and, at, least, 20, 000, rape, cases, whereas, the, illusion, school, group, rejects, the, tribunal, s, findings, as, victor, s, justice, according, to, askew, the, great, massacre, school, is, more, sophisticated, and, the, credibility, of, its, conclusions, are, supported, by, a, large, number, of, authoritative, academics, askew, estimates, that, the, city, s, population, was, 224, 500, from, december, 24, 1937, to, january, 5, 1938, hora, tomio, a, japanese, history, professor, at, waseda, university, published, a, book, in, 1967, following, his, 1966, visit, to, china, devoting, a, third, of, the, book, to, the, massacre, during, the, 1970s, katsuichi, honda,

yamamoto, using, the, pen, name, isaiah, ben, dasan, wrote, an, article, that, denied, the, massacre, and, akira, suzuki, published, a, book, that, denied, the, massacre, however, the, debate, was, short, lived, because, no, denialist, produced, a, study, that, was, as, comprehensive, as, the, one, conducted, by, hora, the, opposition, fell, short, of, denying, the, massacre, there, are, disputes, about, the, official, death, toll, of, the, massacre, this, estimate, includes, an, estimation, that, the, japanese, army, murdered, 57, 418, chinese, pows, at, mufushan, though, the, latest, research, indicates, that, between, 4, 000, and, 20, 000, were, massacred, and, it, also, includes, the, 112, 266, corpses, apparently, buried, by, the, chongshantang, a, charitable, association, though, today, some, historians, argue, that, the, chongshantang, s, records, were, at, least, greatly, exaggerated, if, not, entirely, fabricated, according, to, bob, wakabayashi, he, estimates, the, death, toll, within, nanjing, city, wall, to, be, around, 40, 000, mostly, massacred, in, the, first, five, days, while, the, total, victims, after, a, 3, month, period, in, nanjing, and, its, surrounding, six, rural, counties, far, exceed, 100, 000, but, fall, short, of, 200, 000, wakabayashi, concludes, that, estimates, of, over, 200, 000, are, not, credible, on, august, 15,

the, people, of, china, don, t, believe, that, an, unequivocal, and, sincere, apology, has, ever, been, made, by, japan, to, china, and, that, a, written, apology, from, japan, would, send, a, better, message, to, the, international, community, a, faction, of, japanese, politicians, who, are, unapologetic, to, the, deaths, in, nanjing, have, triggered, a, recurring, point, of, tension, in, sino,

point, of, contention, in, sino, japanese, relations, since, the, early, 1970s, trade, between, the, two, nations, is, worth, over, 200, billion, annually, despite, this, many, chinese, people, still, have, a, strong, sense, of, mistrust, due, to, the, memory, of, the, atrocity, and, failure, of, reconciliation, measures, this, sense, of, mistrust, is, strengthened, by, japan, s, unwillingness, to, admit, to, and, apologize, for, the, atrocities, takashi, yoshida, described, how, changing, political, concerns, and, perceptions, of, the, national, interest, in, japan, china, and, the, u, s, have, shaped, the, collective, memory, of, the, nanjing, massacre, yoshida, contended, that, over, time, the, event, has, acquired, different, meanings, to, different, people, people, from, mainland, china, saw, themselves, as, the, victims, for, japan, it, was, a, question, they, needed, to, answer, but, were, reluctant, to, do, so, because, they, too, identified, themselves, as, victims, after, the, a, bombs, the, u, s, which, served, as, the, melting, pot, of, cultures, and, is, home, to, descendants, of, members, of, both, chinese, and, japanese, cultures, took, up, the, mantle, of, investigator, for, the, victimized, chinese, yoshida, has, argued, that, the, nanjing, massacre, has, figured, in, the, attempts, of, all, three, nations, as, they, work, to, preserve, and, redefine, national, and, ethnic, pride, and, identity, assuming, different, kinds, of, significance, based, on, each, country, s, changing, internal, and, external, enemies, many, japanese, prime, ministers, have, visited, the, yasukuni, shrine, a, shrine, for, japanese, war, deaths, up, until, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, which, includes, war, criminals, that, were, involved, in, the, nanjing, massacre, in, the, museum, adjacent, to, the, shrine, a, panel, informs, visitors, that, there, was, no, massacre, in, nanjing, but, that, chinese, soldiers, in, plain, clothes, were, dealt, with, severely, in, 2006, former, japanese, prime, minister, junichiro, koizumi, made, a, pilgrimage, to, the, shrine, despite, warnings, from, china, and, south, korea, his, decision, to, visit, the, shrine, regardless, sparked, international, outrage, although, koizumi, denied, that, he, was, trying, to, glorify, war, or, historical, japanese, militarism, the, chinese, foreign, ministry, accused, koizumi, of, wrecking, the, political, foundations, of, china, japan, relations, an, official, from, south, korea, said, they, would, summon, the, tokyo, ambassador, to, protest, the, massacre, is, contentiously, compared, to, other, disasters, in, china, which, include, the, great, chinese, famine, 1959, 1961, and, the, cultural, revolution, yoshida, asserts, that, nanjing, has, figured, in, the, attempts, of, all, three, nations, to, preserve, and, redefine, national, and, ethnic, pride, and, identity, assuming, different, kinds, of, significance, based, on, each, country, s, changing, internal, and, external, enemies, iris, chang, in, her, book, rape, of, nanjing, asserted, that, the, politics, of, the, cold, war, encouraged, chairman, mao, to, stay, relatively, silent, about, nanjing, in, order, to, keep, a, trade, relationship, with, japan, jung, chang, and, jon, halliday, s, biography, of, mao, claims, mao, never, made, any, comment, either, contemporaneously, or, later, in, his, life, about, the, massacre, but, did, frequently, remark, with, enduring, bitterness, about, a, political, struggle, between, himself, and, wang, ming, which, also, occurred, in, december, 1937, before, the, 1970s, china, did, relatively, little, to, draw, attention, to, the, nanjing, massacre, there, was, also, virtually, no, public, commemoration, until, after, 1982, however, china, was, not, oblivious, to, the, japanese, debate, over, the, massacre, in, 1982, concerned, with, japanese, denialism, accounts, of, the, nanjing, massacre, alongside, other, wartime, atrocities, committed, by, japan, in, china, emerged, in, the, chinese, media, concerns, regarding, japanese, denialism, about, the, massacre, was, not, confined, solely, to, the, people, s, republic, of, china, scholars, in, taiwan, also, initiated, a, response, publishing, many, studies, about, japanese, atrocities, in, china, according, to, american, journalist, howard, w, french, mentioning, of, the, massacre, was, suppressed, in, china, because, ideologically, the, communists, would, rather, promote, the, martyrs, of, class, struggles, than, wartime, victims, especially, when, there, were, no, communist, heroes, or, any, communists, at, all, in, nanjing, when, the, massacre, happened, according, to, guo, qiang, liu, and, fengqi, qian, of, deakin, university, only, since, the, 1990s, through, the, revisionist, patriotic, education, campaign, the, massacre, has, become, a, national, memory, as, an, episode, of, the, century, of, humiliation, prior, to, the, communist, founding, of, a, new, china, this, orthodox, victimhood, narrative, has, become, entwined, with, the, chinese, national, identity, and, is, very, sensitive, to, the, revisionist, sentiments, from, the, far, right, in, japan, which, makes, the, memory, of, the, massacre, a, recurring, point, of, tension, in, sino, japanese, relations, after, 1982, following, the, end, of, world, war, ii, some, circles, of, civil, society, in, japan, reflected, on, the, extent, of, the, massacre, and, the, participation, of, ordinary, soldiers, notably, the, novelist, hotta, yoshie, wrote, a, novel, time, jikan, in, 1953, portraying, the, massacre, from, the, point, of, view, of, a, chinese, intellectual, watching, it, happen, this, novel, has, been, translated, into, chinese, and, russian, other, eyewitnesses, to, the, massacre, also, expressed, their, opinions, in, japanese, magazines, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, but, political, shifts, slowly, eroded, this, tide, of, confessions, in, 21st, century, japan, the, nanjing, massacre, touches, upon, national, identity, and, notions, of, pride, honor, and, shame, yoshida, argues, that, nanjing, crystallizes, a, much, larger, conflict, over, what, should, constitute, the, ideal, perception, of, the, nation, japan, as, a, nation, acknowledges, its, past, and, apologizes, for, its, wartime, wrongdoings, or, stands, firm, against, foreign, pressures, and, teaches, japanese, youth, about, the, benevolent, and, courageous, martyrs, who, fought, a, just, war, to, save, asia, from, western, aggression, recognizing, the, nanjing, massacre, as, such, can, be, viewed, in, some, circles, in, japan, as, japan, bashing, in, the, case, of, foreigners, or, self, flagellation, in, the, case, of, japanese, the, government, of, japan, states, that, it, cannot, be, denied, that, the, killing, of, a, large, number, of, noncombatants, looting, and, other, acts, by, the, japanese, army, occurred, however, it, also, states, that, the, actual, number, of, victims, is, hard, to, determine, the, most, widely, used, japanese, textbooks, for, junior, high, schools, do, contain, references, to, the, nanjing, massacre, and, other, issues, like, comfort, women, fiercely, critical, of, such, references, the, japanese, society, for, history, textbook, reform, published, the, new, history, textbook, attempts, to, whitewash, japan, s, war, record, during, the, 1930s, and, early, 1940s, it, referred, to, the, nanjing, massacre, as, an, incident, and, glossed, over, the, issue, of, comfort, women, there, is, also, only, one, sentence, that, refers, to, the, event, they, occupied, that, city, in, december, this, revisionist, textbook, though, approved, by, the, government, was, shunned, by, nearly, all, school, districts, and, only, used, by, 13, schools, dockworkers, in, australia, were, horrified, by, the, massacre, and, refused, to, load, pig, iron, onto, ships, heading, for, japan, leading, to, the, dalfram, dispute, of, 1938, in, december, 2007, the, prc, government, published, the, names, of, 13, 000, people, who, were, killed, by, japanese, troops, in, the, nanjing, massacre, according, to, xinhua, news, agency, it, is, the, most, complete, record, to, date, the, report, consists, of, eight, volumes, and, was, released, to, mark, the, 70th, anniversary, of, the, start, of, the, massacre, it, also, lists, the, japanese,
