the, history, of, australia, is, the, history, of, the, land, and, peoples, which, comprise, the, commonwealth, of, australia, the, modern, nation, came, into, existence, on, 1, january, 1901, as, a, federation, of, former, british, colonies, the, human, history, of, australia, however, commences, with, the, arrival, of, the, first, ancestors, of, aboriginal, australians, by, sea, from, maritime, southeast, asia, between, 50, 000, and, 65, 000, years, ago, and, continues, to, the, present, day, multicultural, democracy, aboriginal, australians, settled, throughout, continental, australia, and, many, nearby, islands, the, artistic, musical, and, spiritual, traditions, they, established, are, among, the, longest, surviving, in, human, history, the, ancestors, of, today, s, ethnically, and, culturally, distinct, torres, strait, islanders, arrived, from, what, is, now, papua, new, guinea, around, 2, 500, years, ago, and, settled, the, islands, on, the, northern, tip, of, the, australian, landmass, dutch, navigators, explored, the, western, and, southern, coasts, in, the, 17th, century, and, named, the, continent, new, holland, macassan, trepangers, visited, australia, s, northern, coasts, from, around, 1720, and, possibly, earlier, in, 1770, lieutenant, james, cook, charted, the, east, coast, of, australia, and, claimed, it, for, great, britain, he, returned, to, london, with, accounts, favouring, colonisation, at, botany, bay, now, in, sydney, the, first, fleet, of, british, ships, arrived, at, botany, bay, in, january, 1788, to, establish, a, penal, colony, in, the, century, that, followed, the, british, established, other, colonies, on, the, continent, and, european, explorers, ventured, into, its, interior, this, period, saw, a, decline, in, the, aboriginal, population, and, the, disruption, of, their, cultures, due, to, introduced, diseases, violent, conflict, and, dispossession, of, their, traditional, lands, from, 1871, the, torres, strait, islanders, welcomed, christian, missionaries, and, the, islands, were, later, annexed, by, queensland, choosing, to, remain, a, part, of, australia, when, papua, new, guinea, gained, independence, from, australia, a, century, later, gold, rushes, and, agricultural, industries, brought, prosperity, transportation, of, british, convicts, to, australia, was, phased, out, from, 1840, to, 1868, autonomous, parliamentary, democracies, began, to, be, established, throughout, the, six, british, colonies, from, the, mid, 19th, century, the, colonies, voted, by, referendum, to, unite, in, a, federation, in, 1901, and, modern, australia, came, into, being, australia, fought, as, part, of, british, empire, and, later, commonwealth, in, the, two, world, wars, and, was, to, become, a, long, standing, ally, of, the, united, states, through, the, cold, war, to, the, present, trade, with, asia, increased, and, a, post, war, immigration, program, received, more, than, 7, million, migrants, from, every, continent, supported, by, immigration, of, people, from, almost, every, country, in, the, world, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, population, increased, to, more, than, 25, 5, million, by, 2021, with, 30, per, cent, of, the, population, born, overseas, the, ancestors, of, aboriginal, australians, moved, into, what, is, now, the, australian, continent, about, 50, 000, to, 65, 000, years, ago, during, the, last, glacial, period, arriving, by, land, bridges, and, short, sea, crossings, from, what, is, now, southeast, asia, the, madjedbebe, rock, shelter, in, arnhem, land, in, the, north, of, the, continent, is, perhaps, the, oldest, site, of, human, occupation, in, australia, from, the, north, the, population, spread, into, a, range, of, very, different, environments, devil, s, lair, in, the, extreme, south, west, of, the, continent, was, occupied, around, 47, 000, years, ago, and, tasmania, by, 39, 000, years, ago, the, oldest, human, remains, found, are, at, lake, mungo, in, new, south, wales, which, have, been, dated, to, around, 41, 000, years, ago, the, site, suggests, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, known, cremations, indicating, early, evidence, for, religious, ritual, among, humans, the, spread, of, the, population, also, altered, the, environment, from, 46, 000, years, ago, firestick, farming, was, used, in, many, parts, of, australia, to, clear, vegetation, make, travel, easier, and, create, open, grasslands, rich, in, animal, and, vegetable, food, sources, the, aboriginal, population, faced, significant, changes, in, the, climate, and, environment, about, 30, 000, years, ago, sea, levels, began, to, fall, temperatures, in, the, south, east, of, the, continent, dropped, by, as, much, as, 9, degrees, celsius, and, the, interior, of, australia, became, more, arid, about, 20, 000, years, ago, new, guinea, and, tasmania, were, connected, to, the, australian, continent, which, was, more, than, a, quarter, larger, than, today, about, 19, 000, years, ago, temperatures, and, sea, levels, began, to, rise, tasmania, became, separated, from, the, mainland, some, 14, 000, years, ago, and, between, 8, 000, and, 6, 000, years, ago, thousands, of, islands, in, the, torres, strait, and, around, the, coast, of, australia, were, formed, the, warmer, climate, was, associated, with, new, technologies, small, back, bladed, stone, tools, appeared, 15, 19, thousand, years, ago, wooden, javelins, and, boomerangs, have, been, found, dating, from, 10, 000, years, ago, stone, points, for, spears, have, been, found, dating, from, 5, 7, thousand, years, ago, spear, throwers, were, probably, developed, more, recently, than, 6, 500, years, ago, aboriginal, tasmanians, were, isolated, from, the, mainland, from, about, 14, 000, years, ago, as, a, result, they, only, possessed, one, quarter, of, the, tools, and, equipment, of, the, adjacent, mainland, coastal, tasmanians, switched, from, fish, to, abalone, and, crayfish, and, more, tasmanians, moved, to, the, interior, around, 4, 000, years, ago, the, first, phase, of, occupation, of, the, torres, strait, islands, began, by, 2, 500, years, ago, more, of, the, islands, were, occupied, and, a, distinctive, torres, strait, islander, maritime, culture, emerged, agriculture, also, developed, on, some, islands, and, by, 700, years, ago, villages, appeared, aboriginal, society, consisted, of, family, groups, organised, into, bands, and, clans, averaging, about, 25, people, each, with, a, defined, territory, for, foraging, clans, were, attached, to, tribes, or, nations, associated, with, particular, languages, and, country, at, the, time, of, european, contact, there, were, about, 600, tribes, or, nations, and, 250, distinct, languages, with, various, dialects, estimates, of, the, aboriginal, population, at, this, time, range, from, 300, 000, to, one, million, aboriginal, society, was, egalitarian, with, no, formal, government, or, chiefs, authority, rested, with, elders, and, group, decisions, were, generally, made, through, the, consensus, of, elders, the, traditional, economy, was, cooperative, with, males, generally, hunting, large, game, while, females, gathered, local, staples, such, as, small, animals, shellfish, vegetables, fruits, seeds, and, nuts, food, was, shared, within, groups, and, exchanged, across, groups, some, aboriginal, groups, engaged, in, fire, stick, farming, fish, farming, and, built, semi, permanent, shelters, the, extent, to, which, some, groups, engaged, in, agriculture, is, controversial, some, anthropologists, describe, traditional, aboriginal, australia, as, a, complex, hunter, gatherer, society, aboriginal, groups, were, semi, nomadic, generally, ranging, over, a, specific, territory, defined, by, natural, features, members, of, a, group, would, enter, the, territory, of, another, group, through, rights, established, by, marriage, and, kinship, or, by, invitation, for, specific, purposes, such, as, ceremonies, and, sharing, abundant, seasonal, foods, as, all, natural, features, of, the, land, were, created, by, ancestral, beings, a, group, s, particular, country, provided,

by, fran, ois, thijssen, and, named, after, pieter, nuyts, in, 1628, a, squadron, of, dutch, ships, explored, the, northern, coast, particularly, in, the, gulf, of, carpentaria, abel, tasman, s, voyage, of, 1642, was, the, first, known, european, expedition, to, reach, van, diemen, s, land, later, tasmania, and, new, zealand, and, to, sight, fiji, on, his, second, voyage, of, 1644, he, also, contributed, significantly, to, the, mapping, of, the, australian, mainland, which, he, called, new, holland, making, observations, on, the, land, and, people, of, the, north, coast, below, new, guinea, following, tasman, s, voyages, the, dutch, were, able, to, make, almost, complete, maps, of, australia, s, northern, and, western, coasts, and, much, of, its, southern, and, south, eastern, tasmanian, coasts, william, dampier, an, english, buccaneer, and, explorer, landed, on, the, north, west, coast, of, new, holland, in, 1688, and, again, in, 1699, and, published, influential, descriptions, of, the, aboriginal, people, in, 1769, lieutenant, james, cook, in, command, of, hms, endeavour, travelled, to, tahiti, to, observe, and, record, the, transit, of, venus, cook, also, carried, secret, admiralty, instructions, to, locate, the, supposed, southern, continent, unable, to, find, this, continent, cook, decided, to, survey, the, east, coast, of, new, holland, the, only, major, part, of, that, continent, that, had, not, been, charted, by, dutch, navigators, on, 19, april, 1770, the, endeavour, reached, the, east, coast, of, new, holland, and, ten, days, later, anchored, at, botany, bay, cook, charted, the, coast, to, its, northern, extent, and, formally, took, possession, of, the, east, coast, of, new, holland, on, 21, 22, august, 1770, when, on, possession, island, off, the, west, coast, of, cape, york, peninsula, he, noted, in, his, journal, that, he, could, land, no, more, upon, this, eastern, coast, of, new, holland, and, on, the, western, side, i, can, make, no, new, discovery, the, honour, of, which, belongs, to, the, dutch, navigators, and, as, such, they, may, lay, claim, to, it, as, their, property, but, the, eastern, coast, from, the, latitude, of, 38, south, down, to, this, place, i, am, confident, was, never, seen, or, viseted, by, any, european, before, us, and, therefore, by, the, same, rule, belongs, to, great, brittan, in, march, 1772, marc, joseph, marion, du, fresne, in, command, of, two, french, ships, reached, van, diemen, s, land, on, his, way, to, tahiti, and, the, south, seas, his, party, became, the, first, recorded, europeans, to, encounter, the, indigenous, tasmanians, and, to, kill, one, of, them, in, the, same, year, a, french, expedition, led, by, louis, aleno, de, st, alo, arn, became, the, first, europeans, to, formally, claim, sovereignty, over, the, west, coast, of, australia, but, no, attempt, was, made, to, follow, this, with, colonisation, although, various, proposals, for, the, colonisation, of, australia, were, made, prior, to, 1788, none, were, attempted, in, 1717, jean, pierre, purry, sent, a, plan, to, the, dutch, east, india, company, for, the, colonisation, of, an, area, in, modern, south, australia, the, company, rejected, the, plan, with, the, comment, that, there, is, no, prospect, of, use, or, benefit, to, the, company, in, it, but, rather, very, certain, and, heavy, costs, in, contrast, emanuel, bowen, in, 1747, promoted, the, benefits, of, exploring, and, colonising, the, country, writing, it, is, impossible, to, conceive, a, country, that, promises, fairer, from, its, situation, than, this, of, terra, australis, no, longer, incognita, as, this, map, demonstrates, but, the, southern, continent, discovered, it, lies, precisely, in, the, richest, climates, of, the, world, and, therefore, whoever, perfectly, discovers, and, settles, it, will, become, infalliably, possessed, of, territories, as, rich, as, fruitful, and, as, capable, of, improvement, as, any, that, have, hitherto, been, found, out, either, in, the, east, indies, or, the, west, john, harris, in, his, navigantium, atque, itinerantium, bibliotheca, or, voyages, and, travels, 1744, 1748, 1764, recommended, exploration, of, the, east, coast, of, new, holland, with, a, view, to, a, british, colonisation, john, callander, put, forward, a, proposal, in, 1766, for, britain, to, found, a, colony, of, banished, convicts, in, the, south, sea, or, in, terra, australis, sweden, s, king, gustav, iii, had, ambitions, to, establish, a, colony, for, his, country, at, the, swan, river, in, 1786, but, the, plan, was, stillborn, the, american, revolutionary, war, 1775, 1783, saw, britain, lose, most, of, its, north, american, colonies, and, consider, establishing, replacement, territories, britain, had, transported, about, 50, 000, convicts, to, the, new, world, from, 1718, to, 1775, and, was, now, searching, for, an, alternative, the, temporary, solution, of, floating, prison, hulks, had, reached, capacity, and, was, a, public, health, hazard, while, the, option, of, building, more, jails, and, workhouses, was, deemed, too, expensive, in, 1779, sir, joseph, banks, the, eminent, scientist, who, had, accompanied, james, cook, on, his, 1770, voyage, recommended, botany, bay, as, a, suitable, site, for, a, penal, settlement, banks, s, plan, was, to, send, 200, to, 300, convicts, to, botany, bay, where, they, could, be, left, to, their, own, devices, and, not, be, a, burden, on, the, british, taxpayer, under, banks, s, guidance, the, american, loyalist, james, matra, who, had, also, travelled, with, cook, produced, a, new, plan, for, colonising, new, south, wales, in, 1783, matra, argued, that, the, country, was, suitable, for, plantations, of, sugar, cotton, and, tobacco, new, zealand, timber, and, hemp, or, flax, could, prove, valuable, commodities, it, could, form, a, base, for, pacific, trade, and, it, could, be, a, suitable, compensation, for, displaced, american, loyalists, following, an, interview, with, secretary, of, state, lord, sydney, in, 1784, matra, amended, his, proposal, to, include, convicts, as, settlers, considering, that, this, would, benefit, both, economy, to, the, publick, humanity, to, the, individual, the, major, alternative, to, botany, bay, was, sending, convicts, to, africa, from, 1775, convicts, had, been, sent, to, garrison, british, forts, in, west, africa, but, the, experiment, had, proved, unsuccessful, in, 1783, the, pitt, government, considered, exiling, convicts, to, a, small, river, island, in, gambia, where, they, could, form, a, self, governing, community, a, colony, of, thieves, at, no, expense, to, the, government, in, 1785, a, parliamentary, select, committee, chaired, by, lord, beauchamp, recommended, against, the, gambia, plan, but, failed, to, endorse, the, alternative, of, botany, bay, in, a, second, report, beauchamp, recommended, a, penal, settlement, at, das, voltas, bay, in, modern, namibia, the, plan, was, dropped, however, when, an, investigation, of, the, site, in, 1786, found, it, to, be, unsuitable, two, weeks, later, in, august, 1786, the, pitt, government, announced, its, intention, to, send, convicts, to, botany, bay, the, government, incorporated, the, settlement, of, norfolk, island, into, their, plan, with, its, attractions, of, timber, and, flax, proposed, by, banks, s, royal, society, colleagues, sir, john, call, and, sir, george, young, there, has, been, a, longstanding, debate, over, whether, the, key, consideration, in, the, decision, to, establish, a, penal, colony, at, botany, bay, was, the, pressing, need, to, find, a, solution, to, the, penal, management, problem, or, whether, broader, imperial, goals, such, as, trade, securing, new, supplies, of, timber, and, flax, for, the, navy, and, the, desirability, of, strategic, ports, in, the, region, were, paramount, christopher, and, maxwell, stewart, argue, that, whatever, the, government, s, original, motives, were, in, establishing, the, colony, by, the, 1790s, it, had, at, least, achieved, the, imperial, objective, of, providing, a, harbour, where, vessels, could, be, careened, and, resupplied, the, territory, of, new, south, wales, claimed, by, britain, included, all, of, australia, eastward, of, the, meridian, of, 135, east, this, included, more, than, half, of, mainland, australia, the, claim, also, included, all, the, islands, adjacent, in, the, pacific, between, the, latitudes, of, cape, york, and, the, southern, tip, of, van, diemen, s, land, tasmania, in, 1817, the, british, government, withdrew, the, extensive, territorial, claim, over, the, south, pacific, passing, an, act, specifying, that, tahiti, new, zealand, and, other, islands, of, the, south, pacific, were, not, within, his, majesty, s, dominions, however, it, is, unclear, whether, the, claim, ever, extended, to, the, current, islands, of, new, zealand, the, colony, of, new, south, wales, was, established, with, the, arrival, of, the, first, fleet, of, 11, vessels, under, the, command, of, captain, arthur, phillip, in, january, 1788, it, consisted, of, more, than, a, thousand, settlers, including, 778, convicts, 192, women, and, 586, men, a, few, days, after, arrival, at, botany, bay, the, fleet, moved, to, the, more, suitable, port, jackson, where, a, settlement, was, established, at, sydney, cove, on, 26, january, 1788, this, date, later, became, australia, s, national, day, australia, day, the, colony, was, formally, proclaimed, by, governor, phillip, on, 7, february, 1788, at, sydney, sydney, cove, offered, a, fresh, water, supply, and, a, safe, harbour, which, phillip, described, as, being, with, out, exception, the, finest, harbour, in, the, world, here, a, thousand, sail, of, the, line, may, ride, in, the, most, perfect, security, governor, phillip, was, vested, with, complete, authority, over, the, inhabitants, of, the, colony, his, intention, was, to, establish, harmonious, relations, with, local, aboriginal, people, and, try, to, reform, as, well, as, discipline, the, convicts, of, the, colony, early, efforts, at, agriculture, were, fraught, and, supplies, from, overseas, were, scarce, between, 1788, and, 1792, about, 3546, male, and, 766, female, convicts, were, landed, at, sydney, many, new, arrivals, were, sick, or, unfit, for, work, and, the, condition, of, healthy, convicts, also, deteriorated, due, to, the, hard, labour, and, poor, food, the, food, situation, reached, crisis, point, in, 1790, and, the, second, fleet, which, finally, arrived, in, june, 1790, had, lost, a, quarter, of, its, passengers, through, sickness, while, the, condition, of, the, convicts, of, the, third, fleet, appalled, phillip, from, 1791, however, the, more, regular, arrival, of, ships, and, the, beginnings, of, trade, lessened, the, feeling, of, isolation, and, improved, supplies, in, 1788, phillip, established, a, subsidiary, settlement, on, norfolk, island, in, the, south, pacific, where, he, hoped, to, obtain, timber, and, flax, for, the, navy, the, island, however, had, no, safe, harbour, which, led, the, settlement, to, be, abandoned, and, the, settlers, evacuated, to, tasmania, in, 1807, the, island, was, subsequently, re, established, as, a, site, for, secondary, transportation, in, 1825, phillip, sent, exploratory, missions, in, search, of, better, soils, fixed, on, the, parramatta, region, as, a, promising, area, for, expansion, and, moved, many, of, the, convicts, from, late, 1788, to, establish, a, small, township, which, became, the, main, centre, of, the, colony, s, economic, life, this, left, sydney, cove, only, as, an, important, port, and, focus, of, social, life, poor, equipment, and, unfamiliar, soils, and, climate, continued, to, hamper, the, expansion, of, farming, from, farm, cove, to, parramatta, and, toongabbie, but, a, building, program, assisted, by, convict, labour, advanced, steadily, between, 1788, and, 1792, convicts, and, their, gaolers, made, up, the, majority, of, the, population, however, a, free, population, soon, began, to, grow, consisting, of, emancipated, convicts, locally, born, children, soldiers, whose, military, service, had, expired, and, finally, free, settlers, from, britain, governor, phillip, departed, the, colony, for, england, on, 11, december, 1792, with, the, new, settlement, having, survived, near, starvation, and, immense, isolation, for, four, years, after, the, departure, of, phillip, the, colony, s, military, officers, began, acquiring, land, and, importing, consumer, goods, obtained, from, visiting, ships, former, convicts, also, farmed, land, granted, to, them, and, engaged, in, trade, farms, spread, to, the, more, fertile, lands, surrounding, paramatta, windsor, richmond, and, camden, and, by, 1803, the, colony, was, self, sufficient, in, grain, boat, building, developed, in, order, to, make, travel, easier, and, exploit, the, marine, resources, of, the, coastal, settlements, sealing, and, whaling, became, important, industries, the, new, south, wales, corps, was, formed, in, england, in, 1789, as, a, permanent, regiment, of, the, british, army, to, relieve, the, marines, who, had, accompanied, the, first, fleet, officers, of, the, corps, soon, became, involved, in, the, corrupt, and, lucrative, rum, trade, in, the, colony, governor, william, bligh, 1806, 1808, tried, to, suppress, the, rum, trade, and, the, illegal, use, of, crown, land, resulting, in, the, rum, rebellion, of, 1808, the, corps, working, closely, with, the, newly, established, wool, trader, john, macarthur, staged, the, only, successful, armed, takeover, of, government, in, australian, history, deposing, bligh, and, instigating, a, brief, period, of, military, rule, prior, to, the, arrival, from, britain, of, governor, lachlan, macquarie, in, 1810, macquarie, served, as, the, last, autocratic, governor, of, new, south, wales, from, 1810, to, 1821, and, had, a, leading, role, in, the, social, and, economic, development, of, new, south, wales, which, saw, it, transition, from, a, penal, colony, to, a, budding, civil, society, he, established, a, bank, a, currency, and, a, hospital, he, employed, a, planner, to, design, the, street, layout, of, sydney, and, commissioned, the, construction, of, roads, wharves, churches, and, public, buildings, he, sent, explorers, out, from, sydney, and, in, 1815, a, road, across, the, blue, mountains, was, completed, opening, the, way, for, large, scale, farming, and, grazing, in, the, lightly, wooded, pastures, west, of, the, great, dividing, range, central, to, macquarie, s, policy, was, his, treatment, of, the, emancipists, whom, he, considered, should, be, treated, as, social, equals, to, free, settlers, in, the, colony, he, appointed, emancipists, to, key, government, positions, including, francis, greenway, as, colonial, architect, and, william, redfern, as, a, magistrate, his, policy, on, emancipists, was, opposed, by, many, influential, free, settlers, officers, and, officials, and, london, became, concerned, at, the, cost, of, his, public, works, in, 1819, london, appointed, j, t, bigge, to, conduct, an, inquiry, into, the, colony, and, macquarie, resigned, shortly, before, the, report, of, the, inquiry, was,

26, 000, on, the, mainland, and, 6, 000, in, van, diemen, s, land, following, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1815, the, transportation, of, convicts, increased, rapidly, and, the, number, of, free, settlers, grew, steadily, from, 1821, to, 1840, 55, 000, convicts, arrived, in, new, south, wales, and, 60, 000, in, van, diemen, s, land, however, by, 1830, free, settlers, and, the,

of, the, settled, colony, in, 1836, a, system, of, annual, licences, authorising, grazing, on, crown, land, was, introduced, in, an, attempt, to, control, the, pastoral, industry, but, booming, wool, prices, and, the, high, cost, of, land, in, the, settled, areas, encouraged, further, squatting, by, 1844, wool, accounted, for, half, of, the, colony, s, exports, and, by, 1850, most, of, the, eastern, third, of, new, south, wales, was, controlled, by, fewer, than, 2, 000, pastoralists, in, 1825, the, western, boundary, of, new, south, wales, was, extended, to, longitude, 129, east, which, is, the, current, boundary, of, western, australia, as, a, result, the, territory, of, new, south, wales, reached, its, greatest, extent, covering, the, area, of, the, modern, state, as, well, as,

of, the, island, soon, centred, on, launceston, in, the, north, and, hobart, in, the, south, from, the, 1820s, free, settlers, were, encouraged, by, the, offer, of, land, grants, in, proportion, to, the, capital, the, settlers, would, bring, van, diemen, s, land, became, a, separate, colony, from, new, south, wales, in, december, 1825, and, continued, to, expand, through, the, 1830s, supported, by, farming, sheep, grazing, and, whaling, following, the, suspension, of, convict, transportation, to, new, south, wales, in, 1840, van, diemen, s, land, became, the, main, destination, for, convicts, transportation, to, van, diemen, s, land, ended, in, 1853, and, in, 1856, the, colony, officially, changed, its, name, to, tasmania, pastoralists, from, van, diemen, s, land, began, squatting, in, the, port, phillip, hinterland, on, the, mainland, in, 1834, attracted, by, its, rich, grasslands, in, 1835, john, batman, and, others, negotiated, the, transfer, of, 100, 000, acres, of, land, from, the, kulin, people, however, the, treaty, was, annulled, the, same, year, when, the, british, colonial, office, issued, the, proclamation, of, governor, bourke, the, proclamation, meant, that, from, then, all, people, found, occupying, land, without, the, authority, of, the, government, would, be, considered, illegal, trespassers, in, 1836, port, phillip, was, officially, recognised, as, a, district, of, new, south, wales, and, opened, for, settlement, the, main, settlement, of, melbourne, was, established, in, 1837, as, a, planned, town, on, the, instructions, of,

the, swan, river, colony, was, established, at, the, sites, of, modern, fremantle, and, perth, becoming, the, first, convict, free, and, privatised, colony, in, australia, however, by, 1850, there, were, a, little, more, than, 5, 000, settlers, the, colony, accepted, convicts, from, that, year, because, of, the, acute, shortage, of, labour, the, province, of, south, australia, was, established, in, 1836, as, a, privately, financed, settlement, based, on, the, theory, of, systematic, colonisation, developed, by, edward, gibbon, wakefield, convict, labour, was, banned, in, the, hope, of, making, the, colony, more, attractive, to, respectable, families, and, promote, an, even, balance, between, male, and, female, settlers, the, city, of, adelaide, was, to, be, planned, with, a, generous, provision, of, churches, parks, and, schools, land, was, to, be, sold, at, a, uniform, price, and, the, proceeds, used, to, secure, an, adequate, supply, of, labour, through, selective, assisted, migration, various, religious, personal, and, commercial, freedoms, were, guaranteed, and, the, letters, patent, enabling, the, south, australia, act, 1834, included, a, guarantee, of, aboriginal, land, rights, the, colony, however, was, badly, hit, by, the, depression, of, 1841, 44, conflict, with, indigenous, traditional, landowners, also, reduced, the, protections, they, had, been, promised, in, 1842, the, settlement, became, a, crown, colony, administered, by, the, governor, and, an, appointed, legislative, council, the, economy, recovered, and, by, 1850, the, settler, population, had, grown, to, 60, 000, in, 1851, the, colony, achieved, limited, self, government, with, a, partially, elected, legislative, council, in, 1824, the, moreton, bay, penal, settlement, was, established, on, the, site, of, present, day, brisbane, in, 1842, the, penal, colony, was, closed, and, the, area, was, opened, for, free, settlement, by, 1850, the, population, of, brisbane, had, reached, 8, 000, and, increasing, numbers, of, pastoralists, were, grazing, cattle, and, sheep, in, the, darling, downs, west, of, the, town, frontier, violence, between, settlers, and, the, indigenous, population, became, severe, as, pastoralism, expanded, north, of, the, tweed, river, a, series, of, disputes, between, northern, pastoralists, and, the, government, in, sydney, led, to, increasing, demands, from, the, northern, settlers, for, separation, from, new, south, wales, in, 1857, the, british, government, agreed, to, the, separation, and, in, 1859, the, colony, of, queensland, was, proclaimed, between, 1788, and, 1868, approximately, 161, 700, convicts, were, transported, to, the, australian, colonies, of, new, south, wales, van, diemen, s, land, and, western, australia, the, literacy, rate, of, convicts, was, above, average, and, they, brought, a, range, of, useful, skills, to, the, new, colony, including, building, farming, sailing, fishing, and, hunting, the, small, number, of, free, settlers, meant, that, early, governors, also, had, to, rely, on, convicts, and, emancipists, for, professions, such, as, lawyers, architects, surveyors, and, teachers, convicts, initially, worked, on, government, farms, and, public, works, such, as, land, clearing, and, building, after, 1792, the, majority, were, assigned, to, work, for, private, employers, including, emancipists, emancipists, were, granted, small, plots, of, land, for, farming, and, a, year, of, government, rations, later, they, were, assigned, convict, labour, to, help, them, work, their, farms, some, convicts, were, assigned, to, military, officers, to, run, their, businesses, these, convicts, learnt, commercial, skills, which, could, help, them, work, for, themselves, when, their, sentence, ended, or, they, were, granted, a, ticket, of, leave, a, form, of, parole, convicts, soon, established, a, system, of, piece, work, which, allowed, them, to, work, for, wages, once, their, allocated, tasks, were, completed, by, 1821, convicts, emancipists, and, their, children, owned, two, thirds, of, the, land, under, cultivation, half, the, cattle, and, one, third, of, the, sheep, they, also, worked, in, trades, and, small, business, emancipists, employed, about, half, of, the, convicts, assigned, to, private, masters, a, series, of, reforms, recommended, by, j, t, bigge, in, 1822, and, 1823, worsened, conditions, for, convicts, the, food, ration, was, cut, and, their, opportunities, to, work, for, wages, restricted, more, convicts, were, assigned, to, rural, work, gangs, bureaucratic, control, and, surveillance, of, convicts, was, made, more, systematic, isolated, penal, settlements, were, established, as, places, of, secondary, punishment, the, rules, for, tickets, of, leave, were, tightened, and, land, grants, were, skewed, to, favour, free, settlers, with, large, capital, as, a, result, convicts, who, arrived, after, 1820, were, far, less, likely, to, become, property, owners, to, marry, and, to, establish, families, the, bigge, reforms, also, aimed, to, encourage, free, settlers, by, offering, them, land, grants, in, proportion, to, their, capital, from, 1831, the, colonies, replaced, land, grants, with, land, sales, by, auction, at, a, fixed, minimum, price, per, acre, the, proceeds, being, used, to, fund, the, assisted, migration, of, workers, from, 1821, to, 1850, australia, attracted, 200, 000, immigrants, from, the, united, kingdom, however, the, system, of, land, allocations, led, to, the, concentration, of, land, in, the, hands, of, a, small, number, of, affluent, settlers, two, thirds, of, the, migrants, to, australia, during, this, period, received, assistance, from, the, british, or, colonial, governments, families, of, convicts, were, also, offered, free, passage, and, about, 3, 500, migrants, were, selected, under, the, english, poor, laws, various, special, purpose, and, charitable, schemes, such, as, those, of, caroline, chisholm, and, john, dunmore, lang, also, provided, migration, assistance, women, comprised, only, about, 15, of, convicts, transported, due, to, the, shortage, of, women, in, the, colony, they, were, more, likely, to, marry, than, men, and, tended, to, choose, older, skilled, men, with, property, as, husbands, the, early, colonial, courts, enforced, the, property, rights, of, women, independently, of, their, husbands, and, the, ration, system, also, gave, women, and, their, children, some, protection, from, abandonment, women, were, active, in, business, and, agriculture, from, the, early, years, of, the, colony, among, the, most, successful, being, the, former, convict, turned, entrepreneur, mary, reibey, and, the, agriculturalist, elizabeth, macarthur, one, third, of, the, shareholders, of, the, first, colonial, bank, founded, in, 1817, were, women, one, of, the, goals, of, the, assisted, migration, programs, from, the, 1830s, was, to, promote, migration, of, women, and, families, to, provide, a, more, even, gender, balance, in, the, colonies, caroline, chisholm, established, a, shelter, and, labour, exchange, for, migrant, women, in, new, south, wales, in, the, 1840s, and, promoted, the, settlement, of, single, and, married, women, in, rural, areas, between, 1830, and, 1850, the, female, proportion, of, the, australian, settler, population, increased, from, 24, per, cent, to, 41, per, cent, the, church, of, england, was, the, only, recognised, church, before, 1820, and, its, clergy, worked, closely, with, the, governors, richard, johnson, chief, chaplain, 1788, 1802, was, charged, by, governor, arthur, phillip, with, improving, public, morality, in, the, colony, and, was, also, heavily, involved, in, health, and, education, samuel, marsden, various, ministries, 1795, 1838, became, known, for, his, missionary, work, the, severity, of, his, punishments, as, a, magistrate, and, the, vehemence, of, his, public, denunciations, of, catholicism, and, irish, convicts, about, a, quarter, of, convicts, were, catholics, the, lack, of, official, recognition, of, catholicism, was, combined, with, suspicion, of, irish, convicts, which, only, increased, after, the, irish, led, castle, hill, rebellion, of, 1804, only, two, catholic, priests, operated, temporarily, in, the, colony, before, governor, macquarie, appointed, official, catholic, chaplains, in, new, south, wales, and, van, diemen, s, land, in, 1820, the, bigge, reports, recommended, that, the, status, of, the, anglican, church, be, enhanced, an, anglican, archdeacon, was, appointed, in, 1824, and, allocated, a, seat, in, the, first, advisory, legislative, council, the, anglican, clergy, and, schools, also, received, state, support, this, policy, was, changed, under, governor, burke, by, the, church, acts, of, 1836, and, 1837, the, government, now, provided, state, support, for, the, clergy, and, church, buildings, of, the, four, largest, denominations, anglican, catholic, presbyterian, and, later, methodist, many, anglicans, saw, state, support, of, the, catholic, church, as, a, threat, the, prominent, presbyterian, minister, john, dunmore, lang, also, promoted, sectarian, divisions, in, the, 1840s, state, support, however, led, to, a, growth, in, church, activities, charitable, associations, such, as, the, catholic, sisters, of, charity, founded, in, 1838, provided, hospitals, orphanages, and, asylums, for, the, old, and, disabled, religious, organisations, were, also, the, main, providers, of, school, education, in, the, first, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, a, notable, example, being, lang, s, australian, college, which, opened, in, 1831, many, religious, associations, such, as, the, sisters, of, st, joseph, co, founded, by, mary, mackillop, in, 1866, continued, their, educational, activities, after, the, provision, of, secular, state, schools, grew,

australia, from, south, to, north, his, expedition, mapped, out, the, route, which, was, later, followed, by, the, australian, overland, telegraph, line, the, completion, of, this, telegraph, line, in, 1872, was, associated, with, further, exploration, of, the, gibson, desert, and, the, nullarbor, plain, while, exploring, central, australia, in, 1872, ernest, giles, sighted, kata, tjuta, from, a, location, near, kings, canyon, and, called, it, mount, olga, the, following, year, willian, gosse, observed, uluru, and, named, it, ayers, rock, in, honour, of, the, chief, secretary, of, south,

kimberley, region, when, the, first, fleet, arrived, in, sydney, cove, with, some, 1, 300, colonists, in, january, 1788, the, aboriginal, population, of, the, sydney, region, is, estimated, to, have, been, about, 3, 000, people, the, first, governor, of, new, south, wales, arthur, phillip, arrived, with, instructions, to, endeavour, by, every, possible, means, to, open, an, intercourse, with, the, natives, and, to, conciliate, their, affections, enjoining, all, our, subjects, to, live, in, amity, and, kindness, with, them, the, relative, isolation, of, the, indigenous, population, for, some, 60, 000, years, meant, that, they, had, little, resistance, to, many, introduced, diseases, an, outbreak, of, smallpox, in, april, 1789, killed, about, half, the, aboriginal, population, of, the, sydney, region, the, source, of, the, outbreak, is, controversial, some, researchers, contend, that, it, originated, from, contact, with, indonesian, fisherman, in, the, far, north, while, others, argue, that, it, is, more, likely, to, have, been, inadvertently, or, deliberately, spread, by, settlers, there, were, further, smallpox, outbreaks, devastating, aboriginal, populations, from, the, late, 1820s, affecting, south, eastern, australia, in, the, early, 1860s, travelling, inland, from, the, coburg, peninsula, in, the, north, to, the, great, australian, bight, in, the, south, and, in, the, late, 1860s, from, the, kimberley, to, geraldton, according, to, josphine, flood, the, estimated, aboriginal, mortality, rate, from, smallpox, was, 60, per, cent, on, first, exposure, 50, per, cent, in, the, tropics, and, 25, per, cent, in, the, arid, interior, other, introduced, diseases, such, as, measles, influenza, typhoid, and, tuberculosis, also, resulted, in, high, death, rates, in, aboriginal, communities, butlin, estimates, that, the, aboriginal, population, in, the, area, of, modern, victoria, was, around, 50, 000, in, 1788, before, two, smallpox, outbreaks, reduced, it, to, about, 12, 500, in, 1830, between, 1835, and, 1853, the, aboriginal, population, of, victoria, fell, from, 10, 000, to, around, 2, 000, it, is, estimated, that, about, 60, per, cent, of, these, deaths, were, from, introduced, diseases, 18, per, cent, from, natural, causes, and, 15, per, cent, from, settler, violence, venereal, diseases, were, also, a, factor, in, indigenous, depopulation, reducing, aboriginal, fertility, rates, in, south, eastern, australia, by, an, estimated, 40, per, cent, by, 1855, by, 1890, up, to, 50, per, cent, of, the, aboriginal, population, in, some, regions, of, queensland, were, affected, the, british, settlement, was, initially, planned, to, be, a, self, sufficient, penal, colony, based, on, agriculture, karskens, argues, that, conflict, broke, out, between, the, settlers, and, the, traditional, owners, of, the, land, because, of, the, settlers, assumptions, about, the, superiority, of, british, civilisation, and, their, entitlement, to, land, which, they, had, improved, through, building, and, cultivation, conflict, also, arose, from, cross, cultural, misunderstandings, and, from, reprisals, for, previous, actions, such, as, the, kidnapping, of, aboriginal, men, women, and, children, reprisal, attacks, and, collective, punishments, were, perpetrated, by, colonists, and, aboriginal, groups, alike, sustained, aboriginal, attacks, on, settlers, the, burning, of, crops, and, the, mass, killing, of, livestock, were, more, obviously, acts, of, resistance, to, the, loss, of, traditional, land, and, food, resources, there, were, intense, conflicts, between, settlers, and, the, darug, people, from, 1794, to, 1800, in, which, 26, settlers, and, up, to, 200, darug, were, killed, conflict, also, erupted, in, dharawal, country, from, 1814, to, 1816, culminating, in, the, appin, massacre, april, 1816, in, which, at, least, 14, aboriginal, people, were, killed, in, the, 1820s, the, colony, spread, over, the, great, dividing, range, opening, the, way, for, large, scale, farming, and, grazing, in, wiradjuri, country, from, 1822, to, 1824, windradyne, led, a, group, of, 50, 100, aboriginal, men, in, raids, which, resulted, in, the, death, of, 15, 20, colonists, estimates, of, aboriginal, deaths, in, the, conflict, range, from, 15, to, 100, in, van, diemen, s, land, the, black, war, broke, out, in, 1824, following, a, rapid, expansion, of, settler, numbers, and, sheep, grazing, in, the, island, s, interior, martial, law, was, declared, in, november, 1828, and, in, october, 1830, a, black, line, of, around, 2, 200, troops, and, settlers, swept, the, island, with, the, intention, of, driving, the, aboriginal, population, from, the, settled, districts, from, 1830, to, 1834, george, augustus, robinson, and, aboriginal, ambassadors, including, truganini, led, a, series, of, friendly, missions, to, the, aboriginal, tribes, which, effectively, ended, the, war, around, 200, settlers, and, 600, to, 900, aboriginal, tasmanians, were, killed, in, the, conflict, and, the, aboriginal, survivors, were, eventually, relocated, to, flinders, island, the, spread, of, settlers, and, pastoralists, into, the, region, of, modern, victoria, in, the, 1830s, also, sparked, conflict, with, traditional, landowners, broome, estimates, that, 80, settlers, and, 1, 000, 1, 500, aboriginal, people, died, in, frontier, conflict, in, victoria, from, 1835, to, 1853, the, growth, of, the, swan, river, colony, in, the, 1830s, led, to, conflict, with, aboriginal, people, culminating, in, the, pinjarra, massacre, in, which, some, 15, to, 30, aboriginal, people, were, killed, according, to, neville, green, 30, settlers, and, 121, aboriginal, people, died, in, violent, conflict, in, western, australia,

aboriginal, casualty, rates, in, conflicts, increased, as, the, colonists, made, greater, use, of, mounted, police, native, police, units, and, newly, developed, revolvers, and, breech, loaded, guns, conflict, was, particularly, intense, in, nsw, in, the, 1840s, and, in, queensland, from, 1860, to, 1880, in, central, australia, it, is, estimated, that, 650, to, 850, aboriginal, people, out, of, a, population, of, 4, 500, were, killed, by, colonists, from, 1860, to, 1895, in, the, gulf, country, of, northern, australia, five, settlers, and, 300, aboriginal, people, were, killed, before, 1886, the, last, recorded, massacre, of, aboriginal, people, by, settlers, was, at, coniston, in, the, northern, territory, in, 1928, where, at, least, 31, aboriginal, people, were, killed, the, spread, of, british, settlement, also, led, to, an, increase, in, inter, tribal, aboriginal, conflict, as, more, people, were, forced, off, their, traditional, lands, into, the, territory, of, other, often, hostile, tribes, butlin, estimated, that, of, the, 8, 000, aboriginal, deaths, in, victoria, from, 1835, to, 1855, 200, were, from, inter, tribal, violence, broome, estimates, the, total, death, toll, from, settler, aboriginal, conflict, between, 1788, and, 1928, as, 1, 700, settlers, and, 17, 20, 000, aboriginal, people, reynolds, has, suggested, a, higher, guesstimate, of, 3, 000, settlers, and, up, to, 30, 000, aboriginals, killed, a, project, team, at, the, university, of, newcastle, australia, has, reached, a, preliminary, estimate, of, 8, 270, aboriginal, deaths, in, frontier, massacres,

1839, and, in, western, australia, in, 1840, the, aim, was, to, extend, the, protection, of, british, law, to, aboriginal, people, to, distribute, rations, and, to, provide, education, instruction, in, christianity, and, occupational, training, however, by, 1857, the, protection, offices, had, been, closed, due, to, their, cost, and, failure, to, meets, their, goals, in, 1825, the, nsw,

wales, 116, aboriginal, reserves, were, established, between, 1860, and, 1894, most, reserves, allowed, aboriginal, people, a, degree, of, autonomy, and, freedom, to, enter, and, leave, in, contrast, the, victorian, board, for, the, protection, of, aborigines, created, in, 1869, had, extensive, power, to, regulate, the, employment, education, and, place, of, residence, of, aboriginal, victorians, and, closely, managed, the, five, reserves, and, missions, established, since, self, government, in, 1858, in, 1886, the, protection, board, gained, the, power, to, exclude, half, caste, aboriginal,

parkes, stated, in, 1890, the, crimson, thread, of, kinship, runs, through, us, all, we, must, unite, as, one, great, australian, people, a, minority, of, nationalists, saw, a, distinctive, australian, identity, rather, than, shared, britishness, as, the, basis, for, a, unified, australia, some, such, as, the, radical, magazine, the, bulletin, and, the, tasmanian, attorney, general, andrew, inglis, clark, were, republicans, while, others, were, prepared, to, accept, a, fully, independent, country, of, australia, with, only, a, ceremonial, role, for, the, british, monarch, a,

world, behind, were, australians, a, white, australia, also, meant, the, exclusion, of, cheap, asian, labour, an, idea, strongly, promoted, by, the, labour, movement, the, growing, nationalist, sentiment, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, was, associated, with, the, development, of, a, distinctively, australian, art, and, literature, artists, of, the, heidelberg, school, such, as, arthur, streeton, frederick, mccubbin, and, tom, roberts, followed, the, example, of, the, european, impressionists, by, painting, in, the, open, air, they, applied, themselves, to, capturing, the, light,

following, decade, lawson, paterson, and, other, writers, such, as, steele, rudd, miles, franklin, and, joseph, furphy, helped, forge, a, distinctive, national, literature, paterson, s, ballad, the,

nationalist, sentiment, coincided, with, business, concerns, about, the, economic, inefficiency, of, customs, barriers, between, the, colonies, the, duplication, of, services, by, colonial, governments, and, the, lack, of, a, single, national, market, for, goods, and, services, colonial, concerns, about, german, and, french, ambitions, in, the, region, also, led, to, british, pressure, for, a, federated, australian, defence, force, and, a, unified, single, gauge, railway, network, for, defence, purposes, a, federal, council, of, australasia, was, formed, in, 1885, but, it, had, few, powers, and, new, south, wales, and, south, australia, declined, to, join, an, obstacle, to, federation, was, the, fear, of, the, smaller, colonies, that, they, would, be, dominated, by, new, south, wales, and, victoria, queensland, in, particular, although, generally, favouring, a, white, australia, policy, wished, to, maintain, an, exception, for, south, sea, islander, workers, in, the, sugar, cane, industry, another, major, barrier, was, the, free, trade, policies, of, new, south, wales, which, conflicted, with, the, protectionist, policies, dominant, in, victoria, and, most, of, the, other, colonies, nevertheless, the, nsw, premier, henry, parkes, was, a, strong, advocate, of, federation, and, his, tenterfield, oration, in, 1889, was, pivotal, in, gathering, support, for, the, cause, in, 1891, a, national, australasian, convention, was, held, in, sydney, with, all, the, colonies, and, new, zealand, represented, a, draft, constitutional, bill, was, adopted, but, the, worsening, economic, depression, and, opposition, in, colonial, parliaments, delayed, progress, citizen, federation, leagues, were, formed, and, at, a, conference, in, corowa, in, july, 1893, they, developed, a, new, plan, for, federation, involving, a, constitutional, convention, with, directly, elected, delegates, and, a, referendum, in, each, colony, to, endorse, the, proposed, constitution, the, new, nsw, premier, george, reid, endorsed, the, corowa, plan, and, in, 1895, convinced, the, majority, of, other, premiers, to, adopt, it, all, of, the, colonies, except, queensland, sent, representatives, to, a, constitutional, convention, which, held, sessions, in, 1897, and, 1898, the, convention, drafted, a, proposed, constitution, for, a, commonwealth, of, federated, states, under, the, british, crown, referendums, held, in, 1898, resulted, in, solid, majorities, for, the, constitution, in, victoria, south, australia, and, tasmania, however, the, referendum, failed, to, gain, the, required, majority, in, new, south, wales, the, premiers, of, the, other, colonies, agreed, to, a, number, of, concessions, to, new, south, wales, particularly, that, the, future, commonwealth, capital, would, be, located, in, that, state, and, in, 1899, further, referendums, were, held, in, all, the, colonies, except, western, australia, all, resulted, in, yes, votes, in, march, 1900,

ratify, the, statute, of, westminster, until, 1942, according, to, historian, frank, crowley, this, was, because, australians, had, little, interest, in, redefining, their, relationship, with,

the, commonwealth, in, 1911, australia, was, deeply, affected, by, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, particularly, due, to, its, heavy, dependence, on, exports, especially, primary, products, such, as, wool, and, wheat, exposed, by, continuous, borrowing, to, fund, capital, works, in, the, 1920s, the, australian, and, state, governments, were, already, far, from, secure, in, 1927, when, most, economic, indicators, took, a, turn, for, the, worse, australia, s, dependence, of, exports, left, her, extraordinarily, vulnerable, to, world, market, fluctuations, according, to, economic, historian, geoff, spenceley, debt, by, the, state, of, new, south, wales, accounted, for, almost, half, of, australia, s, accumulated, debt, by, december, 1927, the, situation, caused, alarm, amongst, a, few, politicians, and, economists, notably, edward, shann, of, the, university, of, western, australia, but, most, political, union, and, business, leaders, were, reluctant, to, admit, to, serious,

and, unemployment, rose, at, elections, held, in, october, 1929, the, labor, party, was, swept, into, power, in, a, landslide, victory, stanley, bruce, the, former, prime, minister, lost, his, own, seat, the, new, prime, minister, james, scullin, and, his, largely, inexperienced, government, were, almost, immediately, faced, with, a, series, of, crises, hamstrung, by, their, lack, of, control, of, the, senate, a, lack, of, control, of, the, banking, system, and, divisions, within, their, party, about, how, best, to, deal, with, the, situation, the, government, was, forced, to, accept, solutions, that, eventually, split, the, party, as, it, had, in, 1917, some, gravitated, to, new, south, wales, premier, lang, others, to, prime, minister, scullin, various, plans, to, resolve, the, crisis, were, suggested, sir, otto, niemeyer, a, representative, of, the, english, banks, who, visited, in, mid, 1930, proposed, a, deflationary, plan, involving, cuts, to, government, spending, and, wages, treasurer, ted, theodore, proposed, a, mildly, inflationary, plan, while, the, labor, premier, of, new, south, wales, jack, lang, proposed, a, radical, plan, which, repudiated, overseas, debt, the, premier, s, plan, finally, accepted, by, federal, and, state, governments, in, june, 1931, followed, the, deflationary, model, advocated, by, niemeyer, and, included, a, reduction, of, 20, per, cent, in, government, spending, a, reduction, in, bank, interest, rates, and, an, increase, in, taxation, in, march, 1931, lang, announced, that, interest, due, in, london, would, not, be, paid, and, the, federal, government, stepped, in, to, meet, the, debt, in, may, the, government, savings, bank, of, new, south, wales, was, forced, to, close, the, melbourne, premiers, conference, agreed, to, cut, wages, and, pensions, as, part, of, a, severe, deflationary, policy, but, lang, renounced, the, plan, the, grand, opening, of, the, sydney, harbour, bridge, in, 1932, provided, little, respite,

often, been, credited, with, steering, recovery, from, the, depression, although, just, how, much, of, this, was, owed, to, their, policies, remains, contentious, stuart, macintyre, also, points, out, that, although, australian, gdp, grew, from, 386, 9, million, to, 485, 9, million, between, 1931, and, 1932, and, 1938, 39, real, domestic, product, per, head, of, population, was, still, but, a, few,

beginning, around, 1932, the, prime, minister, joseph, lyons, favoured, the, tough, economic, measures, of, the, premiers, plan, pursued, an, orthodox, fiscal, policy, and, refused, to, accept, the, proposals, of, the, premier, of, new, south, wales, jack, lang, to, default, on, overseas, debt, repayments, according, to, author, anne, henderson, of, the, sydney, institute, lyons, held, a, steadfast, belief, in, the, need, to, balance, budgets, lower, costs, to, business, and, restore, confidence, and, the, lyons, period, gave, australia, stability, and, eventual, growth, between, the, drama, of, the, depression, and, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, a, lowering, of, wages, was, enforced, and, industry, tariff, protections, maintained, which, together, with, cheaper, raw, materials, during, the, 1930s, saw, a, shift, from, agriculture, to, manufacturing, as, the, chief, employer, of, the, australian, economy, a, shift, which, was, consolidated, by, increased, investment, by, the, commonwealth, government, into, defence, and, armaments, manufacture, lyons, saw, restoration, of, australia, s, exports, as, the, key, to, economic, recovery, the, extent, of, unemployment, in, australia, often, cited, as, peaking, at, 29, per, cent, in, 1932, is, debated, trade, union, figures, are, the, most, often, quoted, but, the, people, who, were, there, regard, the, figures, as, wildly, understating, the, extent, of, unemployment, wrote, historian, wendy, lowenstein, in, her, collection, of, oral, histories, of, the, depression, however, david, potts, argued, that, over, the, last, thirty, years, historians, of, the, period, have, either, uncritically, accepted, that, figure, 29, in, the, peak, year, 1932, including, rounding, it, up, to, a, third, or, they, have, passionately, argued, that, a, third, is, far, too, low, potts, himself, though, suggested, a, peak, national, figure, of, 25, per, cent, unemployed, measurement, is, difficult, in, part, because, there, was, great, variation, geographically, by, age, and, by, gender, in, the, level, of, unemployment, statistics, collected, by, historian, peter, spearritt, show, 17, 8, per, cent, of, men, and, 7, 9, per, cent, of, women, unemployed, in, 1933, in, the, comfortable, sydney, suburb, of, woollahra, this, is, not, to, say, that, 81, 9, per, cent, of, women, were, working, but, that, 7, 9, per, cent, of, the, women, interested, looking, for, work, were, unable, to, find, it, a, much, lower, figure, than, maybe, first, thought, as, many, women, stayed, home, and, were, not, in, the, job, force, in, those, years, especially, if, they, were, unable, to, find, work, in, the, working, class, suburb, of, paddington, 41, 3, per, cent, of, men, and, 20, 7, per, cent, of, women, were, listed, as, unemployed, geoffrey, spenceley, stated, that, apart, from, variation, between, men, and, women, unemployment, was, also, much, higher, in, some, industries, such, as, the, building, and, construction, industry, and, comparatively, low, in, the, public, administrative, and, professional, sectors, in, country, areas, worst, hit, were, small, farmers, in, the, wheat, belts, as, far, afield, as, north, east, victoria, and, western, australia, who, saw, more, and, more, of, their, income, absorbed, by, interest, payments, extraordinary, sporting, successes, did, something, to, alleviate, the, spirits, of, australians, during, the, economic, downturn, in, a, sheffield, shield, cricket, match, at, the, sydney, cricket, ground, in, 1930, don, bradman, a, young, new, south, welshman, of, just, 21, years, of, age, wrote, his, name, into, the, record, books, by, smashing, the, previous, highest, batting, score, in, first, class, cricket, with, 452, runs, not, out, in, just, 415, minutes, the, rising, star, s, world, beating, cricketing, exploits, were, to, provide, australians, with, much, needed, joy, through, the, emerging, great, depression, in, australia, and,

although, the, commonwealth, became, responsible, for, the, aboriginal, population, of, the, northern, territory, from, 1911, by, that, date, the, commonwealth, and, all, states, except, tasmania, had, passed, legislation, establishing, protectors, of, aborigines, and, protection, boards, with, extensive, powers, to, regulate, the, lives, of, aboriginal, australians, including, their, ownership, of, property, place, of, residence, employment, sexual, relationships, and, custody, of, their, children, reserves, were, established, ostensibly, for, the, protection, of, the, aboriginal, population, who, had, been, dispossessed, of, their, land, church, groups, also, ran, missions, throughout, australia, providing, shelter, food, religious, instruction, and, elementary, schooling, for, indigenous, people, some, officials, were, concerned, by, the, growing, number, of, aboriginal, children, of, mixed, heritage, particularly, in, northern, australia, where, large, indigenous, south, sea, islander, and, asian, populations, were, seen, as, inconsistent, with, the, white, australia, policy, laws, concerning, aboriginal, australians, were, progressively, tightened, to, make, it, easier, for, officials, to, remove, aboriginal, children, of, mixed, descent, from, their, parents, and, place, them, in, reserves, missions, institutions, and, employment, with, white, employers, the, segregation, of, aboriginal, people, on, reserves, and, in, institutions, was, never, systematically, accomplished, due, to, funding, constraints, differing, policy, priorities, in, the, states, and, territories, and, resistance, from, aboriginal, people, in, the, more, densely, settled, areas, of, australia, about, 20, per, cent, of, aboriginal, people, lived, on, reserves, in, the, 1920s, the, majority, lived, in, camps, on, the, fringes, of, country, towns, and, a, small, percentage, lived, in, cities, during, the, great, depression, more, aboriginal, people, moved, to, reserves, and, missions, for, food, and, shelter, by, 1941, almost, half, of, the, aboriginal, population, of, new, south, wales, lived, on, reserves, in, northern, australia, the, majority, of, employed, aboriginal, people, worked, in, the, pastoral, industry, where, they, lived, in, camps, often, with, their, extended, families, many, also, camped, on, the, margins, of, towns, and, reserves, where, they, could, avoid, most, of, the, controls, imposed, by, the, administrators, of, reserves, compounds, and, missions, the, 1937, native, welfare, conference, of, state, and, commonwealth, officials, endorsed, a, policy, of, biological, absorption, of, mixed, descent, aboriginal, australians, into, the, white, community, he, destiny, of, the, natives, of, aboriginal, origin, but, not, of, the, full, blood, lies, in, their, ultimate, absorption, by, the, people, of, the, commonwealth, and, it, therefore, recommends, that, all, efforts, be, directed, to, that, end, the, officials, saw, the, policy, of, aboriginal, assimilation, by, absorption, into, the, white, community, as, progressive, aimed, at, eventually, achieving, civil, and, economic, equality, for, mixed, descent, aboriginal, people, efforts, of, all, state, authorities, should, be, directed, towards, the, education, of, children, of, mixed, aboriginal, blood, at, white, standards, and, their, subsequent, employment, under, the, same, conditions, as, whites, with, a, view, to, their, taking, their, place, in, the, white, community, on, an, equal, footing, with, the, whites, the, following, decades, saw, an, increase, in, the, number, of, aboriginal, australians, of, mixed, descent, removed, from, their, families, although, the, states, and, territories, progressively, adopted, a, policy, of, cultural, rather, than, biological, assimilation, and, justified, removals, on, the, grounds, of, child, welfare, in, 1940, new, south, wales, became, the, first, state, to, introduce, a, child, welfare, model, whereby, aboriginal, children, of, mixed, descent, were, removed, from, their, families, under, general, welfare, provisions, by, court, order, other, jurisdictions, introduced, a, welfare, model, after, the, war, until, the, late, 1930s, defence, was, not, a, significant, issue, for, australians, at, the, 1937, elections, both, political, parties, advocated, increased, defence, spending, in, the, context, of, increased, japanese, aggression, in, china, and, germany, s, aggression, in, europe, however, there, was, a, difference, in, opinion, about, how, the, defence, spending, should, be, allocated, the, united, australia, party, government, emphasised, co, operation, with, britain, in, a, policy, of, imperial, defence, the, lynchpin, of, this, was, the, british, naval, base, at,

too, dangerous, a, hazard, upon, which, to, found, australia, s, defence, policy, according, to, john, robertson, some, british, leaders, had, also, realised, that, their, country, could, not, fight, japan, and, germany, at, the, same, time, but, this, was, never, discussed, candidly, at, meeting, s, of, australian, and, british, defence, planners, such, as, the, 1937, imperial, conference, by,

indigenous, australians, the, 1951, native, welfare, conference, of, state, and, commonwealth, officials, had, agreed, on, a, policy, of, cultural, assimilation, for, all, aboriginal, australians, paul, hasluck, the, commonwealth, minister, for, territories, stated, assimilation, means, in, practical, terms, that, in, the, course, of, time, it, is, expected, that, all, persons, of, aboriginal,

necessary, and, even, though, some, people, were, thankful, for, it, in, retrospect, overall, it, was, a, disaster, it, was, a, rupturing, of, tens, of, thousands, of, aboriginal, families, aimed, at, eradicating, aboriginality, from, the, nation, in, the, cause, of, homogeneity, and, in, fear, of, difference, in, the, early, 1950s, the, menzies, government, saw, australia, as, part, of, a, triple, alliance, in, concert, with, both, the, us, and, traditional, ally, britain, at, first, the, australian, leadership, opted, for, a, consistently, pro, british, line, in, diplomacy, while, at, the, same, time, looking, for, opportunities, to, involve, the, us, in, south, east, asia, thus, the, government, committed, military, forces, to, the, korean, war, and, the, malayan, emergency, and,

our, people, stand, together, till, the, crack, of, doom, as, british, influence, declined, in, south, east, asia, the, us, alliance, came, to, have, greater, significance, for, australian, leaders, and, the, australian, economy, british, investment, in, australia, remained, significant, until, the, late, 1970s, but, trade, with, britain, declined, through, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, in, the, late,

british, had, no, part, according, to, diplomat, alan, renouf, the, dominant, theme, in, australia, s, foreign, policy, under, australia, s, liberal, country, party, governments, of, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, was, anti, communism, another, former, diplomat, gregory, clark, suggested, that, it, was, specifically, a, fear, of, china, that, drove, australian, foreign, policy, decisions, for, twenty, years, the, anzus, security, treaty, which, had, been, signed, in, 1951, had, its, origins, in, australia, s, and, new, zealand, s, fears, of, a, rearmed, japan, its, obligations, on, the, us, australia, and, new, zealand, are, vague, but, its, influence, on, australian, foreign, policy, thinking, at, times, has, been, significant, the, seato, treaty, signed, only, three, years, later, clearly, demonstrated, australia, s, position, as, a, us, ally, in, the, emerging, cold, war, as, britain, struggled, to, enter, the, common, market, in, the, 1960s, australia, saw, that, its, historic, ties, with, the, mother, country, were, rapidly, fraying, canberra, was, alarmed, but, kept, a, low, profile, not, wanting, to, alienate, london, russel, ward, states, that, the, implications, of, british, entry, into, europe, in, 1973, seemed, shattering, to, most, australians, particularly, to, older, people, and, conservatives, carl, bridge, however, points, out, that, australia, had, been, hedging, its, british, bets, for, some, time, the, anzus, treaty, and, australia, s, decision, to, enter, the, vietnam, war, did, not, involve, britain, and, by, 1967, japan, was, australia, s, leading, export, partner, and, the, us, her, largest, source, of, imports, according, to, bridge, australia, s, decision, not, to, follow, britain, s, devaluation, of, her,

government, made, a, sudden, announcement, that, after, close, consultation, with, the, united, states, a, battalion, of, troops, was, to, be, sent, to, south, vietnam, in, parliament, menzies, emphasised, the, argument, that, our, alliances, made, demands, on, us, the, alliance, involved, was, presumably, the, southeast, asia, treaty, organization, seato, and, australia, was, providing, military, assistance, because, south, vietnam, a, signatory, to, seato, had, apparently, requested, it, documents, released, in, 1971, indicated, that, the, decision, to, commit, troops, was, made, by, australia, and, the, us, not, at, the, request, of, south, vietnam, by, 1968, there, were, three, australian, army, battalions, at, any, one, time, at, the, 1st, australian, task, force, 1atf,
