war, ii, encompassing, denmark, norway, luxembourg, belgium, the, netherlands, the, united, kingdom, france, and, germany, the, italian, front, is, considered, a, separate, but, related, theatre, the, western, front, s, 1944, 1945, phase, was, officially, deemed, the, european, theater, by, the, united, states, whereas, italy, fell, under, the, mediterranean, theater, along, with, the, north, african, campaign, the, western, front, was, marked, by, two, phases, of, large, scale, combat, operations, the, first, phase, saw, the, capitulation, of, luxembourg, netherlands, belgium, and, france, during, may, and, june, 1940, after, their, defeat, in, the, low, countries, and, the, northern, half, of, france, and, continued, into, an, air, war, between, germany, and, britain, that, climaxed, with, the, battle, of, britain, the, second, phase, consisted, of, large, scale, ground, combat, supported, by, a, massive, strategic, air, war, considered, to, be, an, additional, front, which, began, in, june, 1944, with, the, allied, landings, in, normandy, and, continued, until, the, defeat, of, germany, in, may, 1945, with, its, invasion, on, 1, september, 1939, world, war, ii, began, with, the, german, invasion, of, poland, in, response, britain, and, france, declared, war, on, germany, on, 3, september, the, next, few, months, in, the, war, were, marked, by, the, phoney, war, the, phoney, war, was, an, early, phase, of, world, war, ii, marked, by, a, few, military, operations, in, continental, europe, in, the, months, following, the, german, invasion, of, poland, and, preceding, the, battle, of, france, although, the, great, powers, of, europe, had, declared, war, on, one, another, neither, side, had, yet, committed, to, launching, a, significant, attack, and, there, was, relatively, little, fighting, on, the, ground, this, was, also, the, period, in, which, the, united, kingdom, and, france, did, not, supply, significant, aid, to, poland, despite, their, pledged, alliance, the, french, forces, launched, a, small, offensive, the, saar, offensive, against, germany, in, the, saar, region, but, halted, their, advance, and, returned, while, most, of, the, german, army, was, fighting, against, poland, a, much, smaller, german, force, manned, the, siegfried, line, their, fortified, defensive, line, along, the, french, border, at, the, maginot, line, on, the, other, side, of, the, border, french, troops, stood, facing, them, whilst, the, british, expeditionary, force, and, other, elements, of, the, french, army, created, a, defensive, line, along, the, belgian, border, there, were, only, some, local, minor, skirmishes, the, british, royal, air, force, dropped, propaganda, leaflets, on, germany, and, the, first, canadian, troops, stepped, ashore, in, britain, while, western, europe, was, in, a, strange, calm, for, seven, months, in, their, hurry, to, re, arm, britain, and, france, had, both, begun, to, buy, large, numbers, of, weapons, from, manufacturers, in, the, united, states, at, the, outbreak, of, hostilities, supplementing, their, own, production, the, non, belligerent, united, states, contributed, to, the, western, allies, by, discounted, sales, of, military, equipment, and, supplies, german, efforts, to, interdict, the, allies, trans, atlantic, trade, at, sea, ignited, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, while, the, western, front, remained, quiet, in, april, 1940, the, fighting, between, the, allies, and, the, germans, began, in, earnest, with, the, norwegian, campaign, when, the, germans, launched, operation, weser, bung, the, german, invasion, of, denmark, and, norway, in, doing, so, the, germans, beat, the, allies, to, the, punch, the, allies, had, been, planning, an, amphibious, landing, in, which, they, could, begin, to, surround, germany, cutting, off, her, supply, of, raw, materials, from, sweden, however, when, the, allies, made, a, counter, landing, in, norway, following, the, german, invasion, the, germans, repulsed, them, and, defeated, the, norwegian, armed, forces, driving, the, latter, into, exile, the, kriegsmarine, nonetheless, suffered, very, heavy, losses, during, the, two, months, of, fighting, required, to, seize, all, of, mainland, norway, in, may, 1940, the, germans, launched, the, battle, of, france, the, western, allies, primarily, the, french, belgian, and, british, land, forces, soon, collapsed, under, the, onslaught, of, the, so, called, blitzkrieg, strategy, following, the, german, breakthrough, at, sedan, the, bef, along, with, the, best, of, the, french, and, belgian, armies, became, trapped, in, flanders, with, the, use, of, paratroopers, and, concentrated, firepower, the, belgian, and, dutch, armies, surrendered, after, several, days, luxembourg, fell, within, the, first, day, the, majority, of, the, british, and, elements, of, the, french, forces, escaped, at, dunkirk, this, was, due, to, the, combined, factors, of, poor, weather, germans, mishaps, and, the, incredible, number, of, british, civilian, ships, assembled, for, the, undertaking, following, the, conclusion, of, events, at, dunkirk, on, june, 4, the, wehrmacht, commenced, fall, rot, an, offensive, against, the, remaining, french, armies, with, most, of, the, french, armies, either, destroyed, or, taken, prisoner, the, germans, quickly, broke, through, the, french, lines, taking, paris, on, june, 14, as, france, was, falling, the, british, began, the, strategic, withdrawal, of, all, remaining, british, troops, from, france, via, french, ports, still, under, allied, control, with, the, war, all, but, decided, italy, also, declared, war, on, the, uk, and, france, but, made, little, progress, with, the, situation, becoming, dire, french, prime, minister, philippe, p, tain, signed, the, second, armistice, of, compi, gne, on, june, 22, 1940, with, its, terms, taking, effect, on, the, 25th, of, june, the, terms, of, the, armistice, called, for, the, occupation, of, northern, france, along, with, the, annexation, of, alsace, lorraine, into, the, german, reich, italy, also, was, allowed, a, small, occupation, zone, in, the, southeast, france, was, allowed, to, continue, its, existence, in, the, form, of, vichy, france, a, rump, state, of, the, former, french, republic, led, by, philippe, p, tain, the, vichy, regime, was, allowed, to, keep, their, colonial, empire, and, navy, as, some, of, hitler, s, few, concessions, in, six, weeks, of, fighting, the, combined, allied, armies, suffered, more, than, 375, 000, killed, or, wounded, as, well, as, 1, 800, 000, soldiers, becoming, prisoners, of, war, meanwhile, germany, suffered, a, more, modest, 43, 110, killed, and, 111, 000, wounded, hitler, had, expected, a, million, men, to, die, in, the, conquest, of, france, remarkedly, low, casualties, and, france, s, quick, defeat, led, to, a, massive, rise, in, morale, among, the, german, people, with, the, fighting, ended, the, germans, began, to, consider, ways, of, resolving, the, question, of, how, to, deal, with, britain, if, the, british, refused, to, agree, to, a, peace, treaty, one, option, was, to, invade, however, nazi, germany, s, kriegsmarine, had, suffered, serious, losses, in, norway, and, in, order, to, even, consider, an, amphibious, landing, germany, s, air, force, the, luftwaffe, had, to, first, gain, air, superiority, or, air, supremacy, with, the, luftwaffe, unable, to, defeat, the, raf, in, the, battle, of, britain, the, invasion, of, great, britain, could, no, longer, be, thought, of, as, an, option, while, the, majority, of, the, german, army, was, mustered, for, the, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, construction, began, on, the, atlantic, wall, a, series, of, defensive, fortifications, along, the, french, coast, of, the, english, channel, these, were, built, in, anticipation, of, an, allied, invasion, of, france, because, of, the, massive, logistical, obstacles, a, cross, channel, invasion, would, face, the, allied, high, command, decided, to, conduct, a, practice, attack, against, the, french, coast, on, 19, august, 1942, the, allies, began, the, dieppe, raid, an, attack, on, dieppe, france, most, of, the, troops, were, canadian, with, some, british, contingents, and, a, small, american, and, free, french, presence, along, with, british, and, polish, naval, support, the, raid, was, a, disaster, almost, two, thirds, of, the, attacking, force, became, casualties, however, much, was, learned, as, a, result, of, the, operation, these, lessons, would, be, put, to, good, use, in, the, subsequent, invasion, for, almost, two, years, there, was, no, land, fighting, on, the, western, front, with, the, exception, of, commando, raids, and, the, guerrilla, actions, of, the, resistance, aided, by, the, special, operations, executive, soe, and, office, of, strategic, services, oss, however, in, the, meantime, the, allies, took, the, war, to, germany, with, a, strategic, bombing, campaign, the, us, eighth, air, force, bombing, germany, by, day, and, raf, bomber, command, bombing, by, night, the, bulk, of, the, allied, armies, were, occupied, in, the, mediterranean, seeking, to, clear, the, sea, lanes, to, the, indian, ocean, repluse, the, axis, from, north, africa, and, commence, the, invasion, of, italy, partly, to, capture, the, foggia, airfield, complex, two, early, british, raids, for, which, battle, honours, were, awarded, were, operation, collar, in, boulogne, 24, june, 1940, and, operation, ambassador, in, guernsey, 14, 15, july, 1940, the, raids, for, which, the, british, awarded, the, north, west, europe, campaign, of, 1942, battle, honour, were, operation, biting, bruneval, 27, 28, february, 1942, st, nazaire, 27, 28, march, 1942, operation, myrmidon, bayonne, 5, april, 1942, operation, abercrombie, hardelot, 21, 22, april, 1942, dieppe, 19, august, 1942, and, operation, frankton, gironde, 7, 12, december, 1942, a, raid, on, sark, on, the, night, of, 3, 4, october, 1942, is, notable, because, a, few, days, after, the, incursion, the, germans, issued, a, propaganda, communiqu, implying, at, least, one, prisoner, had, escaped, and, two, were, shot, while, resisting, having, their, hands, tied, this, instance, of, tying, prisoner, s, hands, contributed, to, hitler, s, decision, to, issue, his, commando, order, instructing, that, all, captured, commandos, or, commando, type, personnel, were, to, be, executed, as, a, matter, of, procedure, by, the, summer, of, 1944, when, an, expectation, of, an, allied, invasion, was, freely, admitted, by, german, commanders, the, disposition, of, troops, facing, it, came, under, the, command, of, ob, west, hq, in, paris, in, turn, it, commanded, the, wehrmacht, netherlands, command,

border, and, the, 19th, army, hq, in, avignon, responsible, for, the, mediterranean, coast, it, was, not, possible, to, predict, where, the, allies, might, choose, to, launch, their, invasion, the, chance, of, an, amphibious, landing, necessitated, the, substantial, dispersal, of, the, german, mobile, reserves, which, contained, the, majority, of, their, panzer, troops, each, army, group, was, allocated, its, mobile, reserves, army, group, b, had, the, 2nd, panzer, division, in, northern, france, 116th, panzer, division, in, the, paris, area, and, the, 21st, panzer, division, in, normandy,

panzer, division, das, reich, refitting, around, the, southern, french, town, of, montauban, and, the, 9th, panzer, division, stationed, in, the, rhone, delta, area, the, okw, retained, a, substantial, reserve, of, such, mobile, divisions, also, but, these, were, dispersed, over, a, large, area, the, 1st, ss, panzer, division, leibstandarte, ss, adolf, hitler, was, still, in, the, netherlands, the, 12th, ss, panzer, division, hitlerjugend, and, the, panzer, lehr, division, were, located, in, the, paris, orleans, area, since, the, normandy, coastal, defence, sectors, or, k, stenverteitigungsabschnitte, kva, were, considered, the, most, likely, areas, for, an, invasion, the, 17th, ss, panzergrenadier, division, g, tz, von, berlichingen, was, located, just, south, of, the, loire, in, the, vicinity, of, tours, on, 6, june, 1944, the, allies, began, operation, overlord, also, known, as, d, day, the, long, awaited, liberation, of, france, the, deception, plans, operation, fortitude, and, operation, bodyguard, had, the, germans, convinced, that, the, invasion, would, occur, in, the, pas, de, calais, while, the, real, target, was, normandy, following, two, months, of, slow, fighting, in, hedgerow, country, operation, cobra, allowed, the, americans, to, break, out, at, the, western, end, of, the, lodgement, soon, after, the, allies, were, racing, across, france, they, encircled, around, 200, 000, germans, in, the, falaise, pocket, as, had, so, often, happened, on, the, eastern, front, hitler, refused, to, allow, a, strategic, withdrawal, until, it, was, too, late, approximately, 150, 000, germans, were, able, to, escape, from, the, falaise, pocket, but, they, left, behind, most, of, their, irreplaceable, equipment, and, 50, 000, germans, were, killed, or, taken, prisoner, the, allies, had, been, arguing, about, whether, to, advance, on, a, broad, front, or, a, narrow, front, from, before, d, day, if, the, british, had, broken, out, of, the, normandy, bridgehead, or, beachhead, around, caen, when, they, launched, operation, goodwood, and, pushed, along, the, coast, facts, on, the, ground, might, have, turned, the, argument, in, favour, of, a, narrow, front, however, as, the, breakout, took, place, during, operation, cobra, at, the, western, end, of, the, bridge, head, the, 21st, army, group, that, included, the, british, and, canadian, forces, swung, east, and, headed, for, belgium, the, netherlands, and, northern, germany, while, the, u, s, twelfth, army, group, advanced, to, their, south, via, eastern, france, luxembourg, and, the, ruhr, area, rapidly, fanning, out, into, a, broad, front, as, this, was, the, strategy, favoured, by, the, supreme, allied, commander, general, dwight, d, eisenhower, and, most, of, the, american, high, command, it, was, soon, adopted, on, 15, august, the, allies, launched, operation, dragoon, the, invasion, of, southern, france, between, toulon, and, cannes, the, us, seventh, army, and, the, french, first, army, making, up, the, us, 6th, army, group, rapidly, consolidated, this, beachhead, and, liberated, southern, france, in, two, weeks, they, then, moved, north, up, the, rhone, valley, their, advance, only, slowed, down, as, they, encountered, regrouped, and, entrenched, german, troops, in, the, vosges, mountains, the, germans, in, france, were, now, faced, by, three, powerful, allied, army, groups, in, the, north, the, british, 21st, army, group, commanded, by, field, marshal, sir, bernard, montgomery, in, the, center, the, american, 12th, army, group, commanded, by, general, omar, bradley, and, to, the, south, the, us, 6th, army, group, commanded, by, lieutenant, general, jacob, l, devers, by, mid, september, the, 6th, army, group, advancing, from, the, south, came, into, contact, with, bradley, s, formations, advancing, from, the, west, and, overall, control, of, devers, force, passed, from, afhq, in, the, mediterranean, so, that, all, three, army, groups, came, under, eisenhower, s, central, command, at, shaef, supreme, headquarters, allied, expeditionary, forces, under, the, onslaught, in, both, the, north, and, south, of, france, the, german, army, fell, back, on, 19, august, the, french, resistance, ffi, organised, a, general, uprising, and, the, liberation, of, paris, took, place, on, 25, august, when, general, dietrich, von, choltitz, accepted, the, french, ultimatum, and, surrendered, to, general, philippe, leclerc, de, hauteclocque, commander, of, the, free, french, 2nd, armored, division, ignoring, orders, from, hitler, that, paris, should, be, held, to, the, last, and, destroyed, the, liberation, of, northern, france, and, the, benelux, countries, was, of, special, significance, for, the, inhabitants, of, london, and, the, southeast, of, england, because, it, denied, the, germans, launch, sites, for, their, mobile, v, 1, and, v, 2, vergeltungswaffen, reprisal, weapons, as, the, allies, advanced, across, france, their, supply, lines, stretched, to, breaking, point, the, red, ball, express, the, allied, trucking, effort, was, simply, unable, to, transport, enough, supplies, from, the, port, facilities, in, normandy, all, the, way, to, the, front, line, which, by, september, was, close, to, the, german, border, major, german, units, in, the, french, southwest, that, had, not, been, committed, in, normandy, withdrew, either, eastwards, towards, alsace, sometimes, directly, across, the, us, 6th, army, group, s, advance, or, into, the, ports, with, the, intention, of, denying, them, to, the, allies, these, latter, groups, were, not, thought, worth, much, effort, and, were, left, to, rot, with, the, exception, of, bordeaux, which, was, liberated, in, may, 1945, by, french, forces, under, general, edgard, de, larminat, operation, venerable, fighting, on, the, western, front, seemed, to, stabilize, and, the, allied, advance, stalled, in, front, of, the, siegfried, line, westwall, and, the, southern, reaches, of, the, rhine, starting, in, early, september, the, americans, began, slow, and, bloody, fighting, through, the, hurtgen, forest, passchendaele, with, tree, bursts, hemingway, to, breach, the, line, the, port, of, antwerp, was, liberated, on, 4, september, by, the, british, 11th, armoured, division, however, it, lay, at, the, end, of, the, long, scheldt, estuary, and, so, it, could, not, be, used, until, its, approaches, were, clear, of, heavily, fortified, german, positions, the, breskens, pocket, on, the, southern, bank, of, the, scheldt, was, cleared, with, heavy, casualties, by, allied, forces, in, operation, switchback, during, the, battle, of, the, scheldt, this, was, followed, by, a, tedious, campaign, to, clear, a, peninsula, dominating, the, estuary, and, finally, the, amphibious, assault, on, walcheren, island, in, november, the, campaign, to, clear, the, scheldt, estuary, along, with, operation, pheasant, was, a, decisive, victory, for, the, allies, as, it, allowed, a, greatly, improved, delivery, of, supplies, directly, from, antwerp, which, was, far, closer, to, the, front, than, the, normandy, beaches, in, october, the, americans, decided, that, they, could, not, just, invest, aachen, and, let, it, fall, in, a, slow, siege, because, it, threatened, the, flanks, of, the, u, s, ninth, army, as, it, was, the, first, major, german, city, to, face, capture, hitler, ordered, that, the, city, be, held, at, all, costs, in, the, resulting, battle, the, city, was, taken, at, a, cost, of, 5, 000, casualties, on, both, sides, with, an, additional, 5, 600, german, prisoners, south, of, the, ardennes, american, forces, fought, from, september, until, mid, december, to, push, the, germans, out, of, lorraine, and, from, behind, the, siegfried, line, the, crossing, of, the, moselle, river, and, the, capture, of, the, fortress, of, metz, proved, difficult, for, the, american, troops, in, the, face, of, german, reinforcements, supply, shortages, and, unfavorable, weather, during, september, and, october, the, allied, 6th, army, group, u, s, seventh, army, and, french, first, army, fought, a, difficult, campaign, through, the, vosges, mountains, that, was, marked, by, dogged, german, resistance, and, slow, advances, in, november, however, the, german, front, snapped, under, the, pressure, resulting, in, sudden, allied, advances, that, liberated, belfort, mulhouse, and, strasbourg, and, placed, allied, forces, along, the, rhine, river, the, germans, managed, to, hold, a, large, bridgehead, the, colmar, pocket, on, the, western, bank, of, the, rhine, and, centered, around, the, city, of, colmar, on, 16, november, the, allies, started, a, large, scale, autumn, offensive, called, operation, queen, with, its, main, thrust, again, through, the, h, rtgen, forest, the, offensive, drove, the, allies, to, the, rur, river, but, failed, in, its, core, objectives, to, capture, the, rur, dams, and, pave, the, way, towards, the, rhine, the, allied, operations, were, then, succeeded, by, the, german, ardennes, offensive, the, port, of, antwerp, was, liberated, on, 4, september, by, the, british, 11th, armoured, division, field, marshal, sir, bernard, montgomery, commanding, the, anglo, canadian, 21st, army, group, persuaded, the, allied, high, command, to, launch, a, bold, attack, operation, market, garden, which, he, hoped, would, get, the, allies, across, the, rhine, and, create, the, narrow, front, he, favoured, airborne, troops, would, fly, in, from, the, united, kingdom, and, take, bridges, over, the, main, rivers, of, the, german, occupied, netherlands, in, three, main, cities, eindhoven, nijmegen, and, arnhem, the, british, xxx, corps, would, punch, through, the, german, lines, along, the, maas, schelde, canal, and, link, up, with, the, airborne, troops, of, the, u, s, 101st, airborne, division, in, eindhoven, the, u, s, 82nd, airborne, division, at, nijmegen, and, the, british, 1st, airborne, division, at, arnhem, if, all, went, well, xxx, corps, would, advance, into, germany, without, any, remaining, major, obstacles, xxx, corps, was, able, to, advance, beyond, six, of, the, seven, airborne, held, bridges, but, was, unable, to, link, up, with, the, troops, near, the, bridge, over, the, rhine, at, arnhem, the, result, was, the, near, destruction, of, the, british, 1st, airborne, division, during, the, battle, of, arnhem, which, sustained, almost, 8, 000, casualties, the, offensive, ended, with, arnhem, remaining, in, german, hands, and, the, allies, holding, an, extended, salient, from, the, belgian, border, to, the, area, between, nijmegen, and, arnhem, a, german, attempt, to, recapture, the, salient, ended, in, failure, in, early, october, the, germans, had, been, preparing, a, massive, counter, attack, in, the, west, since, the, allied, breakout, from, normandy, the, plan, called, wacht, am, rhein, watch, on, the, rhine, was, to, attack, through, the, ardennes, and, swing, north, to, antwerp, splitting, the, american, and, british, armies, the, attack, started, on, 16, december, in, what, became, known, as, the, battle, of, the, bulge, defending, the, ardennes, were, troops, of, the, us, first, army, initial, successes, in, bad, weather, which, gave, them, cover, from, the, allied, air, forces, resulted, in, a, german, penetration, of, over, 80, km, 50, mi, to, within, less, than, 16, km, 10, mi, of, the, meuse, having, been, taken, by, surprise, the, allies, regrouped, and, the, germans, were, stopped, by, a, combined, air, and, land, counter, attack, which, eventually, pushed, them, back, to, their, starting, points, by, 25, january, 1945, the, germans, launched, a, second, smaller, offensive, nordwind, into, alsace, on, 1, january, 1945, aiming, to, recapture, strasbourg, the, germans, attacked, the, 6th, army, group, at, multiple, points, because, the, allied, lines, had, become, severely, stretched, in,
