trans, saharan, trade, is, trade, between, sub, saharan, africa, and, north, africa, that, requires, travel, across, the, sahara, though, this, trade, began, in, prehistoric, times, the, peak, of, trade, extended, from, the, 8th, century, until, the, early, 17th, century, ce, the, sahara, once, had, a, different, climate, and, environment, in, libya, and, algeria, from, at, least, 7000, bce, pastoralism, the, herding, of, sheep, and, goats, large, settlements, and, pottery, were, present, cattle, were, introduced, to, the, central, sahara, ahaggar, between, 4000, to, 3500, bce, remarkable, rock, paintings, dated, 3500, to, 2500, bce, in, arid, regions, portray, flora, and, fauna, that, are, not, present, in, the, modern, desert, as, a, desert, the, sahara, is, now, a, hostile, expanse, that, separates, the, mediterranean, economy, from, the, economy, of, the, niger, river, basin, as, fernand, braudel, points, out, crossing, such, a, zone, especially, without, mechanized, transport, is, worthwhile, only, when, exceptional, circumstances, cause, the, expected, gain, to, outweigh, the, cost, and, the, danger, trade, was, conducted, by, caravans, of, camels, according, to, maghrebi, explorer, ibn, battuta, who, once, traveled, with, a, caravan, an, average, one, would, amount, to, 1, 000, camels, but, some, caravans, were, as, large, as, 12, 000, the, caravans, were, guided, by, highly, paid, berbers, who, knew, the, desert, and, could, ensure, protection, from, fellow, desert, nomads, the, caravans, survival, relied, on, careful, coordination, runners, would, be, sent, ahead, to, oases, for, water, to, be, shipped, out, to, the, caravan, when, it, was, still, several, days, away, as, the, caravans, could, usually, not, carry, enough, to, make, the, full, journey, in, the, mid, 14th, century, ce, ibn, battuta, crossed, the, desert, from, sijilmasa, via, the, salt, mines, at, taghaza, to, the, oasis, of, oualata, a, guide, was, sent, ahead, and, water, was, brought, over, a, four, day, journey, from, oualata, to, meet, the, caravan, culture, and, religion, were, also, exchanged, on, the, trans, saharan, trade, routes, many, west, african, states, eventually, adopted, arabic, writing, and, the, religion, of, north, africa, resulting, in, these, states, absorption, into, the, muslim, world, ancient, trade, spanned, the, northeastern, corner, of, the, sahara, in, the, naqadan, era, predynastic, egyptians, in, the, naqada, i, period, traded, with, nubia, to, the, south, the, oases, of, the, western, desert, to, the, west, and, the, cultures, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, to, the, east, many, trading, routes, went, from, oasis, to, oasis, to, resupply, on, both, food, and, water, these, oases, were, very, important, they, also, imported, obsidian, from, senegal, to, shape, blades, and, other, objects, the, overland, route, through, the, wadi, hammamat, from, the, nile, to, the, red, sea, was, known, as, early, as, predynastic, times, drawings, depicting, egyptian, reed, boats, have, been, found, along, the, path, dating, to, 4000, bce, ancient, cities, dating, to, the, first, dynasty, of, egypt, arose, along, both, its, nile, and, red, sea, junctions, testifying, to, the, route, s, ancient, popularity, it, became, a, major, route, from, thebes, to, the, red, sea, port, of, elim, where, travelers, then, moved, on, to, either, asia, arabia, or, the, horn, of, africa, records, exist, documenting, knowledge, of, the, route, among, senusret, i, seti, ramesses, iv, and, also, later, the, roman, empire, especially, for, mining, the, darb, al, arba, n, trade, route, passing, through, kharga, in, the, south, and, asyut, in, the, north, was, used, from, as, early, as, the, old, kingdom, for, the, transport, and, trade, of, gold, ivory, spices, wheat, animals, and, plants, later, ancient, romans, would, protect, the, route, by, lining, it, with, varied, forts, and, small, outposts, some, guarding, large, settlements, complete, with, cultivation, described, by, herodotus, as, a, road, traversed, in, forty, days, it, became, by, his, time, an, important, land, route, facilitating, trade, between, nubia, and, egypt, and, subsequently, became, known, as, the, forty, days, road, from, kobbei, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, north, of, al, fashir, the, route, passed, through, the, desert, to, bir, natrum, another, oasis, and, salt, mine, to, wadi, howar, before, proceeding, to, egypt, the, darb, el, arbain, trade, route, was, the, easternmost, of, the, central, routes, the, westernmost, of, the, three, central, routes, was, the, ghadames, road, which, ran, from, the, niger, river, at, gao, north, to, ghat, and, ghadames, before, terminating, at, tripoli, next, was, the, easiest, of, the, three, routes, the, garamantean, road, named, after, the, former, rulers, of, the, land, it, passed, through, and, also, called, the, bilma, trail, the, garamantean, road, passed, south, of, the, desert, near, murzuk, before, turning, north, to, pass, between, the, alhaggar, and, tibesti, mountains, before, reaching, the, oasis, at, kawar, from, kawar, caravans, would, pass, over, the, great, sand, dunes, of, bilma, where, rock, salt, was, mined, in, great, quantities, for, trade, before, reaching, the, savanna, north, of, lake, chad, this, was, the, shortest, of, the, routes, and, the, primary, exchanges, were, slaves, and, ivory, from, the, south, for, salt, one, early, 20th, century, researcher, wrote, of, the, tripoli, murzuk, lake, chad, route, most, of, the, traffic, from, the, mediterranean, coast, during, the, last, 2, 000, years, has, passed, along, this, road, another, libyan, route, was, benghazi, to, kufra, to, the, lands, of, the, wadai, empire, between, lake, chad, and, darfur, the, western, routes, were, the, walata, road, past, present, day, oualata, mauritania, from, the, s, n, gal, river, and, the, taghaza, trail, from, the, niger, river, past, the, salt, mines, of, taghaza, north, to, the, great, trading, center, of, sijilmasa, situated, in, morocco, just, north, of, the, desert, the, growth, of, the, city, of, aoudaghost, founded, in, the, 5th, century, bce, was, stimulated, by, its, position, at, the, southern, end, of, a, trans, saharan, trade, route, to, the, east, three, ancient, routes, connected, the, south, to, the, mediterranean, the, herdsmen, of, the, fezzan, of, libya, known, as, the, garamantes, controlled, these, routes, as, early, as, 1500, bce, from, their, capital, of, germa, in, the, wadi, ajal, the, garamantean, empire, raided, north, to, the, sea, and, south, into, the, sahel, by, the, 4th, century, bce, the, independent, city, states, of, phoenicia, had, expanded, their, control, to, the, territory, and, routes, once, held, by, the, garamantes, shillington, states, that, existing, contact, with, the, mediterranean, received, added, incentive, with, the, growth, of, the, port, city, of, carthage, founded, c, 800, bce, carthage, became, one, terminus, for, west, african, gold, ivory, and, slaves, west, africa, received, salt, cloth, beads, and, metal, goods, shillington, proceeds, to, identify, this, trade, route, as, the, source, for, west, african, iron, smelting, trade, continued, into, roman, times, although, there, are, classical, references, to, direct, travel, from, the, mediterranean, to, west, africa, daniels, p, 22f, most, of, this, trade, was, conducted, through, middlemen, inhabiting, the, area, and, aware, of, passages, through, the, drying, lands, the, legio, iii, augusta, subsequently, secured, these, routes, on, behalf, of, rome, by, the, 1st, century, ce, safeguarding, the, southern, border, of, the, empire, for, two, and, half, centuries, the, garamantes, also, engaged, in, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, the, garamantes, used, slaves, in, their, own, communities, to, construct, and, maintain, underground, irrigation, systems, known, as, the, foggara, early, records, of, trans, saharan, slave, trade, come, from, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, in, the, 5th, century, bce, who, records, the, garamantes, enslaving, cave, dwelling, egyptians, in, sudan, two, records, of, romans, accompanying, the, garamantes, on, slave, raiding, expeditions, are, recorded, the, first, in, 86, ce, and, the, second, a, few, years, later, to, lake, chad, initial, sources, of, slaves, were, the, toubou, people, but, by, the, 1st, century, ce, the, garamantes, were, obtaining, slaves, from, modern, day, niger, and, chad, in, the, early, roman, empire, the, city, of, lepcis, established, a, slave, market, to, buy, and, sell, slaves, from, the, african, interior, the, empire, imposed, customs, tax, on, the, trade, of, slaves, in, the, 5th, century, ce, roman, carthage, was, trading, in, black, slaves, brought, across, the, sahara, black, slaves, seem, to, have, been, valued, in, the, mediterranean, as, household, slaves, for, their, exotic, appearance, some, historians, argue, that, the, scale, of, slave, trade, in, this, period, may, have, been, higher, than, medieval, times, due, to, high, demand, of, slaves, in, the, roman, empire, herodotus, wrote, of, the, garamantes, hunting, ethiopian, troglodytes, from, chariots, this, account, was, associated, with, depictions, of, horses, drawing, chariots, in, contemporary, cave, art, in, southern, morocco, and, the, fezzan, giving, origin, to, a, theory, that, the, garamantes, or, some, other, saharan, people, had, created, chariot, routes, to, provide, rome, and, carthage, with, gold, and, ivory, however, it, has, been, argued, that, no, horse, skeletons, have, been, found, dating, from, this, early, period, in, the, region, and, chariots, would, have, been, unlikely, vehicles, for, trading, purposes, due, to, their, small, capacity, the, earliest, evidence, for, domesticated, camels, in, the, region, dates, from, the, 3rd, century, used, by, the, berbers, they, enabled, more, regular, contact, across, the, entire, width, of, the, sahara, but, regular, trade, routes, did, not, develop, until, the, beginnings, of, the, islamic, conversion, of, west, africa, in, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, two, main, trade, routes, developed, the, first, ran, through, the, western, desert, from, modern, morocco, to, the, niger, bend, the, second, from, modern, tunisia, to, the, lake, chad, area, these, stretches, were, relatively, short, and, had, the, essential, network, of, occasional, oases, that, established, the, routing, as, inexorably, as, pins, in, a, map, further, east, of, the, fezzan, with, its, trade, route, through, the, valley, of, kaouar, to, lake, chad, libya, was, impassable, due, to, its, lack, of, oases, and, fierce, sandstorms, several, trade, routes, became, established, perhaps, the, most, important, terminating, in, sijilmasa, morocco, and, ifriqiya, to, the, north, there, and, in, other, north, african, cities, berber, traders, had, increased, contact, with, islam, encouraging, conversions, and, by, the, 8th, century, muslims, were, traveling, to, ghana, many, in, ghana, converted, to, islam, and, it, is, likely, that, the, empire, s, trade, was, privileged, as, a, result, around, 1050, ghana, lost, aoudaghost, to, the, almoravids, but, new, goldmines, around, bure, reduced, trade, through, the, city, instead, benefiting, the, malinke, of, the, south, who, later, founded, the, mali, empire, unlike, ghana, mali, was, a, muslim, kingdom, since, its, foundation, and, under, it, the, gold, salt, trade, continued, other, less, important, trade, goods, were, slaves, kola, nuts, from, the, south, and, slave, beads, and, cowry, shells, from, the, north, for, use, as, currency, it, was, under, mali, that, the, great, cities, of, the, niger, bend, including, gao, and, djenn, prospered, with, timbuktu, in, particular, becoming, known, across, europe, for, its, great, wealth, important, trading, centers, in, southern, west, africa, developed, at, the, transitional, zone, between, the, forest, and, the, savanna, examples, include, begho, and, bono, manso, in, present, day, ghana, and, bondoukou, in, present, day, c, te, d, ivoire, western, trade, routes, continued, to, be, important, with, ouadane, oualata, and, chinguetti, being, the, major, trade, centres, in, what, is, now, mauritania, while, the, tuareg, towns, of, assod, and, later, agadez, grew, around, a, more, easterly, route, in, what, is, now, niger, the, eastern, trans, saharan, route, led, to, the, development, of, the, long, lived, kanem, bornu, empire, as, well, as, the, ghana, mali, and, songhai, empires, centred, on, the, lake, chad, area, this, trade, route, was, somewhat, less, efficient, and, only, rose, to, great, prominence, when, there, was, turmoil, in, the, west, such, as, during, the, almohad, conquests, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, established, in, antiquity, continued, during, the, middle, ages, the, slaves, brought, from, across, the, sahara, were, mainly, used, by, wealthy, families, as, domestic, servants, and, concubines, some, served, in, the, military, forces, of, egypt, and, morocco, for, example, the, 17th, century, sultan, mawlay, ismail, himself, was, the, son, of, slave, and, relied, on, an, army, of, black, slaves, for, support, the, west, african, states, imported, highly, trained, slave, soldiers, it, has, been, estimated, that, from, the, 10th, to, the, 19th, century, some, 6, 000, to, 7, 000, enslaved, people, were, transported, north, each, year, perhaps, as, many, as, nine, million, enslaved, people, were, exported, along, the, trans, saharan, caravan, route, the, rise, of, the, ghana, empire, in, what, is, now, mali, senegal, and, southern, mauritania, accompanied, the, increase, in, trans, saharan, trade, northern, economies, were, short, of, gold, but, at, times, controlled, salt, mines, such, as, taghaza, in, the, sahara, whereas, west, african, countries, like, wangara, had, plenty, of, gold, but, needed, salt, taghaza, a, trading, and, mining, outpost, where, ibn, battuta, recorded, the, buildings, were, made, of, salt, rose, to, preeminence, in, the, salt, trade, under, the, hegemony, of, the, almoravid, empire, the, salt, was, mined, by, slaves, and, purchased, with, manufactured, goods, from, sijilmasa, miners, cut, thin, rectangular, slabs, of, salt, directly, out, of, the, desert, floor, and, caravan, merchants, transported, them, south, charging, a, transportation, fee, of, almost, 80, of, the, salt, s, value, the, salt, was, traded, at, the, market, of, timbuktu, almost, weight, for, weight, with, gold, the, gold, in, the, form, of, bricks, bars, blank, coins, and, gold, dust, went, to, sijilmasa, from, which, it, went, out, to, mediterranean, ports, and, in, which, it, was, struck, into, almoravid, dinars, the, spread, of, islam, to, sub, saharan, african, was, linked, to, trans, saharan, trade, islam, spread, via, trade, routes, and, africans, converting, to, islam, increased, trade, and, commerce, which, increased, the, trade, s, population, historians, give, many, reasons, for, the, spread, of, islam, facilitating, trade, islam, established, common, values, and, rules, upon, which, trade, was, conducted, it, created, a, network, of, believers, who, trust, each, other, and, therefore, trade, with, each, other, even, if, they, do, not, personally, know, each, other, such, trade, networks, existed, before, islam, but, on, a, much, smaller, scale, the, spread, of, islam, increased, the, number, of, nodes, in, the, network, and, decreased, its, vulnerability, the, use, of, arabic, as, a, common, language, of, trade, and, the, increase, of, literacy, through, quranic, schools, also, facilitated, commerce, muslim, merchants, conducting, commerce, also, gradually, spread, islam, along, their, trade, network, social, interactions, with, muslim, merchants, led, many, africans, to, convert, to, islam, and, many, merchants, married, local, women, and, raised, their, children, as, muslims, islam, spread, into, western, sudan, by, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, into, chad, by, the, 11th, century, and, into, hausa, lands, in, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, by, 1200, many, ruling, elites, in, western, africa, had, converted, to, islam, and, from, 1200, to, 1500, saw, a, significant, conversion, to, islam, in, africa, the, portuguese, forays, along, the, west, african, coast, opened, up, new, avenues, for, trade, between, europe, and, west, africa, by, the, early, 16th, century, european, trading, bases, the, factories, established, on, the, coast, since, 1445, and, trade, with, europeans, became, of, prime, importance, to, west, africa, north, africa, had, declined, in, both, political, and, economic, importance, while, the, saharan, crossing, remained, long, and, treacherous, however, the, major, blow, to, trans, saharan, trade, was, the, battle, of, tondibi, of, 1591, 92, in, a, major, military, expedition, organized, by, the, saadian, sultan, ahmad, al, mansur, morocco, sent, troops, across, the, sahara, and, attacked, timbuktu, gao, and, some, other, important, trading, centres, destroying, buildings, and, property, and, exiling, prominent, citizens, this, disruption, to, trade, led, to, a, dramatic, decline, in, the, importance, of, these, cities, and, the, resulting, animosity, reduced, trade, considerably, although, much, reduced, trans, saharan, trade, continued, but, trade, routes, to, the, west, african, coast, became, increasingly, easy, particularly, after, the, french, invasion, of, the, sahel, in, the, 1890s, and, subsequent, construction, of, railways, to, the, interior, a, railway, line, from, dakar, to, algiers, via, the, niger, bend, was, planned, but, never, constructed, with, the, independence, of, nations, in, the, region, in, the, 1960s, the, north, south, routes, were, severed, by, national, boundaries, national, governments, were, hostile, to, tuareg, nationalism, and, so, made, few, efforts, to, maintain, or, support, trans, saharan, trade, and, the, tuareg, rebellion, of, the, 1990s, and, algerian, civil, war, further, disrupted, these, routes, closing, many, traditional, caravan, routes, are, largely, void, of, camels, but, the, shorter, azalai, routes, from, agadez, to, bilma, and, timbuktu, to, taoudenni, are, still, regularly, if, lightly, used, some, members, of, the, tuareg, still, use, the, traditional, trade, routes, often, traveling, 2, 400, km, 1, 500, mi, and, six, months, out, of, every, year, by, camel, across, the, sahara, trading, in, salt, carried, from, the, desert, interior, to, communities, on, the, desert, edges, the, african, union, and, african, development, bank, support, the, trans, sahara, highway, from, algiers, to, lagos, via, tamanrasset, to, stimulate, economic, development, and, the, latter, noted, an, increase, in, traffic, at, the, border, with, chad, due, to, exports, to, algeria, crossing, niger, the, route, is, paved, except, for, a, 120, mi, 200, km, section, in, northern, niger, but, border, restrictions, still, hamper, traffic, only, a, few, trucks, carry, trans, saharan, trade, particularly, fuel, and, salt, three, other, highways, across, the, sahara, are, proposed, for, further, details, see, trans, african, highways, building, the, highways, is, difficult, because, of, sandstorms
