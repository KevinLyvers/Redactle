historiography, of, champa, scholars, agree, that, historically, champa, was, divided, into, several, regions, or, principalities, spread, out, from, south, to, north, along, the, coast, of, modern, vietnam, and, united, by, a, common, language, culture, and, heritage, it, is, acknowledged, that, the, historical, record, is, not, equally, rich, for, each, of, the, regions, in, every, historical, period, for, example, in, the, 10th, century, ce, the, record, is, richest, for, indrapura, in, the, 12th, century, ce, it, is, richest, for, vijaya, following, the, 15th, century, ce, it, is, richest, for, panduranga, some, scholars, have, taken, these, shifts, in, the, historical, record, to, reflect, the, movement, of, the, cham, capital, from, one, location, to, another, according, to, such, scholars, if, the, 10th, century, record, is, richest, for, indrapura, it, is, so, because, at, that, time, indrapura, was, the, capital, of, champa, other, scholars, have, disputed, this, contention, holding, that, champa, was, never, a, united, country, and, arguing, that, the, presence, of, a, particularly, rich, historical, record, for, a, given, region, in, a, given, period, is, no, basis, for, claiming, that, the, region, functioned, as, the, capital, of, a, united, champa, during, that, period, through, the, centuries, cham, culture, and, society, were, influenced, by, forces, emanating, from, cambodia, china, java, and, india, amongst, others, an, official, successfully, revolted, against, chinese, rule, in, modern, central, vietnam, and, l, m, p, a, predecessor,

led, to, the, infusion, of, indian, culture, into, cham, society, sanskrit, was, adopted, as, a, scholarly, language, and, hinduism, especially, shaivism, became, the, state, religion, starting, from, the, 10th, century, ce, the, arab, maritime, trade, introduces, islamic, cultural, and, religious, influences, to, the, region, although, hinduism, was, the, predominant, religion, among, the, cham, people, until, the, 16th, century, islam, began, to, attract, large, numbers, of, chams, when, some, members, of, the, cham, royalty, converted, to, islam, in, the, 17th, century, champa, came, to, serve, as, an, important, link, in, the, spice, trade, which, stretched, from, the, persian, gulf, to, south, china, and, later, in, the, arab, maritime, routes, in, mainland, southeast, asia, as, a, supplier, of, aloe, despite, the, frequent, wars, between, the, cham, and, the, khmer, the, two, nations, also, traded, and, their, cultural, influences, moved, in, the, same, directions, since, royal, families, of, the, two, countries, intermarried, frequently, champa, also, had, close, trade, and, cultural, relations, with, the, powerful, maritime, empire, of, srivijaya, and, later, with, the, majapahit, of, the, malay, archipelago, its, easternmost, trade, relations, being, with, the, kingdoms, of, ma, i, butuan, and, sulu, in, the, philippines, evidence, gathered, from, linguistic, studies, around, aceh, confirms, that, a, very, strong, chamic, cultural, influence, existed, in, indonesia, this, is, indicated, by, the, use, of, the, chamic, language, acehnese, as, the, main, language, in, the, coastal, regions, of, aceh, linguists, believe, the, acehnese, language, a, descendant, of, the, proto, chamic, language, separated, from, the, chamic, tongue, sometime, in, the, 1st, millennium, bce, however, scholarly, views, on, the, precise, nature, of, aceh, chamic, relations, vary, tsat, a, northern, chamic, language, spoken, by, the, utsul, on, the, hainan, island, is, speculated, to, be, separated, from, cham, at, the, time, when, contact, between, champa, and, islam, had, grown, considerably, but, precise, details, remain, inadequate, under, chinese, language, influence, over, hainan, tsat, has, become, fully, monosyllabic, while, some, certain, shifts, to, monosyllabicity, can, be, observed, in, eastern, cham, in, contact, with, vietnamese, eastern, cham,

the, temple, is, said, to, date, from, 965, ce, it, is, of, a, commanding, personage, seated, cross, legged, upon, a, throne, she, is, also, worshiped, by, the, vietnamese, a, tradition, that, dates, back, to, the, 11th, century, during, the, ly, dynasty, period, the, chams, descended, from, seafaring, settlers, who, reached, the, southeast, asian, mainland, from, borneo, about, the, time, of, the, sa, hu, nh, culture, between, 1000, bce, and, 200, ce, the, predecessor, of, the, cham, kingdom, the, cham, language, is, part, of, the, austronesian, family, according, to, one, study, cham, is, related, most, closely, to, modern, acehnese, in, northern, sumatra, the, sa, hu, nh, culture, was, an, austronesian, seafaring, culture, that, centered, around, present, day, central, vietnam, coastal, region, during, its, heyday, the, culture, distributed, across, the, central, vietnam, coast, and, had, commercial, links, across, the, south, china, sea, with, the, philippine, archipelago, and, even, with, taiwan, through, maritime, jade, road, sa, huynh, kalanay, interaction, sphere, which, now, most, archaeologists, and, scholars, have, consentient, determined, and, are, no, longer, hesitant, in, linking, with, the, ancestors, of, the, austronesian, cham, and, chamic, speaking, peoples, while, northern, vietnam, kinh, people, assimilated, han, chinese, immigrants, into, their, population, have, a, sinicized, culture, cham, people, carry, the, patrilineal, r, m17, haplogroup, of, south, asian, indian, origin, from, south, asian, merchants, spreading, hinduism, to, champa,

in, which, kinh, expanded, south, from, their, red, river, delta, homeland, in, the, nam, ti, n, lit, southward, advance, process, which, also, matches, the, event, 700, years, ago, when, the, cham, population, suffered, massive, losses, with, the, exception, of, cham, who, are, austronesian, speaking, and, mang, who, are, austroasiatic, speaking, the, southern, han, chinese, and, all, other,

against, chinese, rule, in, 192, around, the, 4th, century, ce, cham, polities, began, to, absorb, much, of, indic, influences, probably, through, its, neighbor, funan, hinduism, was, established, as, champa, began, to, create, sanskrit, stone, inscriptions, and, erect, red, brick, hindu, temples, the, first, king, acknowledged, in, the, inscriptions, is, bhadravarman, who, reigned, from, 380, to, 413, ce, at, m, s, n, king, bhadravarman, established, a, linga, called, bhadresvara, whose, name, was, a, combination, of, the, king, s, own, name, and, that, of, the, hindu, god, of, gods, shiva,

navigators, as, early, as, the, 5th, century, ce, the, cham, might, have, reached, india, by, themselves, king, gangaraja, r, 413, of, champa, was, perhaps, the, only, known, southeast, asian, ruler, who, traveled, all, the, way, to, india, shortly, after, his, abdication, he, personally, went, on, pilgrimage, in, the, ganges, river, northeast, india, his, itinerary, was, confirmed, by, both, indigenous, cham, sources, and, chinese, chronicles, george, coed, s, notes, that, during, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, century, an, influx, of, indian, traders, priests, and, scholars, travelled, along, the, early, east, asia, south, asian, subcontinent, maritime, route, could, have, visited, and, made, communications, with, local, chamic, communities, along, the, coast, of, central, vietnam, they, played, some, roles, in, disseminating, indian, culture, and, buddhism, but, that, was, not, sustained, and, decisive, as, active, indianized, native, societies, he, argues, or, southeast, asian, kingdoms, that, had, already, been, indianized, like, funan, were, the, key, factors, of, the, process, on, the, other, hand, paul, mus, suggests, the, reason, for, the, peaceful, acceptance, of, hinduism, by, the, cham, elite, was, likely, related, to, the, tropical, monsoon, climate, background, shared, by, areas, like, the, bay, of, bengal, coastal, mainland, southeast, asia, all, the, way, from, myanmar, to, vietnam, monsoon, societies, tended, to, practice, animism, most, importantly, the, creed, of, earth, spirit, to, the, early, southeast, asian, peoples, hinduism, was, somewhat, similar, to, their, original, beliefs, this, resulted, in, peaceful, conversions, to, hinduism, and, buddhism, in, champa, with, little, resistance, rudravarman, i, of, champa, r, 529, 572, a,
