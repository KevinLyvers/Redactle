the, great, famine, also, known, as, the, great, hunger, irish, an, gorta, m, r, the, famine, and, the, irish, potato, famine, was, a, period, of, starvation, and, disease, in, ireland, lasting, from, 1845, to, 1852, that, constituted, a, historical, social, crisis, and, subsequently, had, a, major, impact, on, irish, society, and, history, as, a, whole, the, most, severely, affected, areas, were, in, the, western, and, southern, parts, of, ireland, where, the, irish, language, was, dominant, and, hence, the, period, was, contemporaneously, known, in, irish, as, an, drochshaol, which, literally, translates, to, the, bad, life, and, loosely, translates, to, the, hard, times, the, worst, year, of, the, famine, was, 1847, which, became, known, as, black, 47, the, population, of, ireland, on, the, eve, of, the, famine, was, about, 8, 5, million, by, 1901, it, was, just, 4, 4, million, during, the, great, hunger, roughly, 1, million, people, died, and, more, than, 1, million, more, fled, the, country, causing, the, country, s, population, to, fall, by, 20, 25, in, some, towns, populations, fell, as, much, as, 67, between, 1841, and, 1871, between, 1845, and, 1855, at, least, 2, 1, million, people, left, ireland, primarily, on, packet, ships, but, also, on, steamboats, and, barques, one, of, the, greatest, exoduses, from, a, single, island, in, history, the, proximate, cause, of, the, famine, was, the, infection, of, potato, crops, by, blight, phytophthora, infestans, throughout, europe, during, the, 1840s, blight, infection, caused, 100, 000, deaths, outside, ireland, and, influenced, much, of, the, unrest, that, culminated, in, european, revolutions, of, 1848, longer, term, reasons, for, the, massive, impact, of, this, particular, famine, included, the, system, of, absentee, landlordism, and, single, crop, dependence, initial, limited, but, constructive, government, actions, to, alleviate, famine, distress, were, ended, by, a, new, whig, administration, in, london, which, pursued, a, laissez, faire, economic, doctrine, but, also, because, some, in, power, believed, in, divine, providence, or, that, the, irish, lacked, moral, character, with, aid, only, resuming, to, some, degree, later, large, amounts, of, food, were, exported, from, ireland, during, the, famine, and, the, refusal, of, london, to, bar, such, exports, as, had, been, done, on, previous, occasions, was, an, immediate, and, continuing, source, of, controversy, contributing, to, anti, british, sentiment, and, the, campaign, for, independence, additionally, the, famine, indirectly, resulted, in, tens, of, thousands, of, households, being, evicted, exacerbated, by, a, provision, forbidding, access, to, workhouse, aid, while, in, possession, of, more, than, one, quarter, acre, of, land, the, famine, was, a, defining, moment, in, the, history, of, ireland, which, was, part, of, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, from, 1801, to, 1922, the, famine, and, its, effects, permanently, changed, the, island, s, demographic, political, and, cultural, landscape, producing, an, estimated, 2, million, refugees, and, spurring, a, century, long, population, decline, for, both, the, native, irish, and, those, in, the, resulting, diaspora, the, famine, entered, folk, memory, the, strained, relations, between, many, irish, people, and, the, then, ruling, british, government, worsened, further, because, of, the, famine, heightening, ethnic, and, sectarian, tensions, and, boosting, nationalism, and, republicanism, both, in, ireland, and, among, irish, emigrants, around, the, world, english, documentary, maker, john, percival, said, that, the, famine, became, part, of, the, long, story, of, betrayal, and, exploitation, which, led, to, the, growing, movement, in, ireland, for, independence, scholar, kirby, miller, makes, the, same, point, debate, exists, regarding, nomenclature, for, the, event, whether, to, use, the, term, famine, potato, famine, or, great, hunger, the, last, of, which, some, believe, most, accurately, captures, the, complicated, history, of, the, period, the, potato, blight, returned, to, europe, in, 1879, but, by, this, time, the, land, war, one, of, the, largest, agrarian, movements, to, take, place, in, 19th, century, europe, had, begun, in, ireland, the, movement, organized, by, the, land, league, continued, the, political, campaign, for, the, three, fs, which, was, issued, in, 1850, by, the, tenant, right, league, during, the, great, famine, when, the, potato, blight, returned, to, ireland, in, the, 1879, famine, the, league, boycotted, notorious, landlords, and, its, members, physically, blocked, the, evictions, of, farmers, the, consequent, reduction, in, homelessness, and, house, demolition, resulted, in, a, drastic, reduction, in, the, number, of, deaths, ireland, was, brought, into, the, united, kingdom, in, january, 1801, following, the, passage, of, the, acts, of, union, executive, power, lay, in, the, hands, of, the, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, and, chief, secretary, for, ireland, who, were, appointed, by, the, british, government, ireland, sent, 105, members, of, parliament, to, the, house, of, commons, of, the, united, kingdom, and, irish, representative, peers, elected, 28, of, their, own, number, to, sit, for, life, in, the, house, of, lords, between, 1832, and, 1859, 70, of, irish, representatives, were, landowners, or, the, sons, of, landowners, in, the, 40, years, that, followed, the, union, successive, british, governments, grappled, with, the, problems, of, governing, a, country, which, had, as, benjamin, disraeli, stated, in, 1844, a, starving, population, an, absentee, aristocracy, an, alien, established, protestant, church, and, in, addition, the, weakest, executive, in, the, world, one, historian, calculated, that, between, 1801, and, 1845, there, had, been, 114, commissions, and, 61, special, committees, inquiring, into, the, state, of, ireland, and, that, without, exception, their, findings, prophesied, disaster, ireland, was, on, the, verge, of, starvation, her, population, rapidly, increasing, three, quarters, of, her, labourers, unemployed, housing, conditions, appalling, and, the, standard, of, living, unbelievably, low, lectures, printed, in, 1847, by, john, hughes, bishop, of, new, york, are, a, contemporary, exploration, into, the, antecedent, causes, particularly, the, political, climate, in, which, the, irish, famine, occurred, the, middleman, system, for, managing, landed, property, was, introduced, in, the, 18th, century, rent, collection, was, left, in, the, hands, of, the, landlords, agents, or, middlemen, this, assured, the, landlord, of, a, regular, income, and, relieved, them, of, direct, responsibility, while, leaving, tenants, open, to, exploitation, by, the, middlemen, the, ability, of, middlemen, was, measured, by, the, rent, income, they, could, contrive, to, extract, from, tenants, middlemen, leased, large, tracts, of, land, from, the, landlords, on, long, leases, with, fixed, rents, and, sublet, to, tenants, keeping, any, money, raised, in, excess, to, the, rent, paid, to, the, landlord, this, system, coupled, with, minimal, oversight, of, the, middlemen, incentivised, harsh, exploitation, of, tenants, middlemen, would, split, a, holding, into, smaller, and, smaller, parcels, so, as, to, increase, the, amount, of, rent, they, could, obtain, tenants, could, be, evicted, for, reasons, such, as, non, payment, of, rents, which, were, high, or, a, landlord, s, decision, to, raise, sheep, instead, of, grain, crops, cottiers, paid, their, rent, by, working, for, the, landlord, while, the, spalpeens, itinerant, labourers, paid, for, short, term, leases, through, temporary, day, work, a, majority, of, catholics, who, constituted, 80, of, the, irish, population, lived, in, conditions, of, poverty, and, insecurity, at, the, top, of, the, social, hierarchy, was, the, ascendancy, class, composed, of, english, and, anglo, irish, families, who, owned, most, of, the, land, and, held, more, or, less, unchecked, power, over, their, tenants, some, of, their, estates, were, vast, for, example, the, earl, of, lucan, owned, more, than, 60, 000, acres, 240, km, 2, many, of, these, landowners, lived, in, england, and, functioned, as, absentee, landlords, the, rent, revenue, collected, from, impoverished, tenants, who, were, paid, minimal, wages, to, raise, crops, and, livestock, for, export, was, mostly, sent, to, england, in, 1800, the, 1st, earl, of, clare, observed, of, landlords, that, confiscation, is, their, common, title, according, to, the, historian, cecil, woodham, smith, landlords, regarded, the, land, as, a, source, of, income, from, which, as, much, as, possible, was, to, be, extracted, with, the, peasantry, brooding, over, their, discontent, in, sullen, indignation, in, the, words, of, the, earl, of, clare, the, landlords, largely, viewed, the, countryside, as, a, hostile, place, in, which, to, live, some, landlords, visited, their, property, only, once, or, twice, in, a, lifetime, if, ever, the, rents, from, ireland, were, generally, spent, elsewhere, an, estimated, 6, 000, 000, was, remitted, out, of, ireland, in, 1842, in, 1843, the, british, government, recognized, that, the, land, management, system, in, ireland, was, the, foundational, cause, of, disaffection, in, the, country, the, prime, minister, established, a, royal, commission, chaired, by, the, earl, of, devon, devon, commission, to, enquire, into, the, laws, regarding, the, occupation, of, land, irish, politician, daniel, o, connell, described, this, commission, as, perfectly, one, sided, being, composed, of, landlords, with, no, tenant, representation, in, february, 1845, devon, reported, it, would, be, impossible, adequately, to, describe, the, privations, which, they, habitually, and, silently, endure, in, many, districts, their, only, food, is, the, potato, their, only, beverage, water, their, cabins, are, seldom, a, protection, against, the, weather, a, bed, or, a, blanket, is, a, rare, luxury, and, nearly, in, all, their, pig, and, a, manure, heap, constitute, their, only, property, the, commissioners, concluded, they, could, not, forbear, expressing, our, strong, sense, of, the, patient, endurance, which, the, labouring, classes, have, exhibited, under, sufferings, greater, we, believe, than, the, people, of, any, other, country, in, europe, have, to, sustain, the, commission, stated, that, bad, relations, between, landlord, and, tenant, were, principally, responsible, for, this, suffering, landlords, were, described, in, evidence, before, the, commission, as, land, sharks, bloodsuckers, and, the, most, oppressive, species, of, tyrant, that, ever, lent, assistance, to, the, destruction, of, a, country, as, any, improvement, made, on, a, holding, by, a, tenant, became, the, property, of, the, landlord, when, the, lease, expired, or, was, terminated, the, incentive, to, make, improvements, was, limited, most, tenants, had, no, security, of, tenure, on, the, land, as, tenants, at, will, they, could, be, turned, out, whenever, the, landlord, chose, the, only, exception, to, this, arrangement, was, in, ulster, where, under, a, practice, known, as, tenant, right, a, tenant, was, compensated, for, any, improvement, they, made, to, their, holding, according, to, woodham, smith, the, commission, stated, that, the, superior, prosperity, and, tranquillity, of, ulster, compared, with, the, rest, of, ireland, were, due, to, tenant, right, landlords, in, ireland, often, used, their, powers, without, compunction, and, tenants, lived, in, dread, of, them, woodham, smith, writes, that, in, these, circumstances, industry, and, enterprise, were, extinguished, and, a, peasantry, created, which, was, one, of, the, most, destitute, in, europe, immense, population, growth, from, about, 2, million, in, 1700, to, 8, million, by, the, time, of, the, great, famine, led, to, increased, division, of, holdings, and, a, consequent, reduction, in, their, average, size, by, 1845, 24, of, all, irish, tenant, farms, were, of, 0, 4, 2, hectares, 1, 5, acres, in, size, while, 40, were, of, 2, 6, hectares, 5, 15, acres, holdings, were, so, small, that, no, crop, other, than, potatoes, would, suffice, to, feed, a, family, shortly, before, the, famine, the, british, government, reported, that, poverty, was, so, widespread, that, one, third, of, all, irish, small, holdings, could, not, support, the, tenant, families, after, rent, was, paid, the, families, survived, only, by, earnings, as, seasonal, migrant, labour, in, england, and, scotland, following, the, famine, reforms, were, implemented, making, it, illegal, to, further, divide, land, holdings, the, 1841, census, showed, a, population, of, just, over, eight, million, two, thirds, of, people, depended, on, agriculture, for, their, survival, but, rarely, received, a, working, wage, they, had, to, work, for, their, landlords, in, return, for, a, small, patch, of, land, to, farm, this, forced, ireland, s, peasantry, to, practice, continuous, monoculture, as, the, potato, was, the, only, crop, that, could, meet, nutritional, needs, the, potato, was, introduced, in, ireland, as, a, garden, crop, of, the, gentry, by, the, late, 17th, century, it, had, become, widespread, as, a, supplementary, food, their, main, diet, was, still, based, on, butter, milk, and, grain, products, the, irish, economy, grew, between, 1760, and, 1815, due, to, infrastructure, expansion, and, the, napoleonic, wars, 1805, 1815, which, had, increased, the, demand, for, food, in, britain, tillage, increased, to, such, an, extent, that, there, was, only, a, small, amount, of, land, available, to, small, farmers, to, feed, themselves, the, potato, was, adopted, as, a, primary, food, source, because, of, its, quick, growth, in, a, comparatively, small, space, by, 1800, the, potato, had, become, a, staple, food, for, one, in, three, irish, people, especially, in, winter, it, eventually, became, a, staple, year, round, for, farmers, a, disproportionate, share, of, the, potatoes, grown, in, ireland, were, the, irish, lumper, creating, a, lack, of, genetic, variability, among, potato, plants, which, increased, vulnerability, to, disease, potatoes, were, essential, to, the, expansion, of, the, cottier, system, they, supported, an, extremely, cheap, workforce, but, at, the, cost, of, lower, living, standards, for, the, labourer, a, potato, wage, shaped, the, expanding, agrarian, economy, the, potato, was, also, used, extensively, as, a, fodder, crop, for, livestock, immediately, prior, to, the, famine, approximately, 33, of, production, amounting, to, 5, 000, 000, short, tons, 4, 500, 000, t, was, typically, used, in, this, way, prior, to, the, arrival, of, phytophthora, infestans, commonly, known, as, blight, only, two, main, potato, plant, diseases, had, been, discovered, one, was, called, dry, rot, or, taint, and, the, other, was, a, virus, known, popularly, as, curl, phytophthora, infestans, is, an, oomycete, a, variety, of, parasitic, non, photosynthetic, organisms, closely, related, to, brown, algae, and, not, a, fungus, in, 1851, the, census, of, ireland, commissioners, recorded, 24, failures, of, the, potato, crop, going, back, to, 1728, of, varying, severity, general, crop, failures, through, disease, or, frost, were, recorded, in, 1739, 1740, 1770, 1800, and, 1807, in, 1821, and, 1822, the, potato, crop, failed, in, munster, and, connaught, in, 1830, and, 1831, counties, mayo, donegal, and, galway, suffered, likewise, in, 1832, 1833, 1834, and, 1836, dry, rot, and, curl, caused, serious, losses, and, in, 1835, the, potato, failed, in, ulster, widespread, failures, throughout, ireland, occurred, in, 1836, 1837, 1839, 1841, and, 1844, according, to, woodham, smith, the, unreliability, of, the, potato, was, an, accepted, fact, in, ireland, experts, are, still, unsure, of, how, and, when, blight, arrived, in, europe, it, almost, certainly, was, not, present, prior, to, 1842, and, probably, arrived, in, 1844, the, origin, of, the, pathogen, has, been, traced, to, the, toluca, valley, in, mexico, whence, it, spread, within, north, america, and, then, to, europe, the, 1845, 1846, blight, was, caused, by, the, herb, 1, strain, of, the, blight, in, 1844, irish, newspapers, carried, reports, concerning, a, disease, that, had, attacked, the, potato, crops, in, america, for, two, years, in, 1843, and, 1844, blight, largely, destroyed, the, potato, crops, in, the, eastern, united, states, ships, from, baltimore, philadelphia, or, new, york, city, could, have, carried, diseased, potatoes, from, these, areas, to, european, ports, american, plant, pathologist, william, c, paddock, posited, that, the, blight, was, transported, via, potatoes, being, carried, to, feed, passengers, on, clipper, ships, sailing, from, america, to, ireland, once, introduced, in, ireland, and, europe, blight, spread, rapidly, by, mid, august, 1845, it, had, reached, much, of, northern, and, central, europe, belgium, the, netherlands, northern, france, and, southern, england, had, all, already, been, affected, on, 16, august, 1845, the, gardeners, chronicle, and, horticultural, gazette, reported, a, blight, of, unusual, character, on, the, isle, of, wight, a, week, later, on, 23, august, it, reported, that, a, fearful, malady, has, broken, out, among, the, potato, crop, in, belgium, the, fields, are, said, to, be, completely, desolated, there, is, hardly, a, sound, sample, in, covent, garden, market, as, for, cure, for, this, distemper, there, is, none, these, reports, were, extensively, covered, in, irish, newspapers, on, 11, september, the, freeman, s, journal, reported, on, the, appearance, of, what, is, called, cholera, in, potatoes, in, ireland, especially, in, the, north, on, 13, september, the, gardeners, chronicle, announced, we, stop, the, press, with, very, great, regret, to, announce, that, the, potato, murrain, has, unequivocally, declared, itself, in, ireland, nevertheless, the, british, government, remained, optimistic, over, the, next, few, weeks, as, it, received, conflicting, reports, only, when, the, crop, was, harvested, in, october, did, the, scale, of, destruction, become, apparent, prime, minister, sir, robert, peel, wrote, to, sir, james, graham, in, mid, october, that, he, found, the, reports, very, alarming, but, allayed, his, fears, by, claiming, that, there, was, always, a, tendency, to, exaggeration, in, irish, news, crop, loss, in, 1845, has, been, estimated, at, anywhere, from, one, third, to, one, half, of, cultivated, acreage, the, mansion, house, committee, in, dublin, to, which, hundreds, of, letters, were, directed, from, all, over, ireland, claimed, on, 19, november, 1845, to, have, ascertained, beyond, the, shadow, of, a, doubt, that, considerably, more, than, one, third, of, the, entire, of, the, potato, crop, has, been, already, destroyed, in, 1846, three, quarters, of, the, harvest, was, lost, to, blight, by, december, a, third, of, a, million, destitute, people, were, employed, in, public, works, according, to, cormac, gr, da, the, first, attack, of, potato, blight, caused, considerable, hardship, in, rural, ireland, from, the, autumn, of, 1846, when, the, first, deaths, from, starvation, were, recorded, seed, potatoes, were, scarce, in, 1847, few, had, been, sown, so, despite, average, yields, hunger, continued, 1848, yields, were, only, two, thirds, of, normal, since, over, three, million, irish, people, were, totally, dependent, on, potatoes, for, food, hunger, and, famine, were, widespread, the, corporation, of, dublin, sent, a, memorial, to, the, queen, praying, her, to, call, parliament, together, early, parliament, was, at, this, time, prorogued, and, to, recommend, the, requisition, of, some, public, money, for, public, works, especially, railways, in, ireland, the, town, council, of, belfast, met, and, made, similar, suggestions, but, neither, body, asked, for, charity, according, to, john, mitchel, one, of, the, leading, repealers, in, early, november, 1845, a, deputation, from, the, citizens, of, dublin, including, the, duke, of, leinster, lord, cloncurry, daniel, o, connell, and, the, lord, mayor, went, to, the, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, lord, heytesbury, to, discuss, the, issue, they, offered, suggestions, such, as, opening, the, ports, to, foreign, corn, stopping, distillation, from, grain, prohibiting, the, export, of, foodstuffs, and, providing, employment, through, public, works, lord, heytesbury, urged, them, not, to, be, alarmed, that, they, were, premature, that, scientists, were, enquiring, into, all, those, matters, and, that, the, inspectors, of, constabulary, and, stipendiary, magistrates, were, charged, with, making, constant, reports, from, their, districts, and, there, was, no, immediate, pressure, on, the, market, on, 8, december, 1845, daniel, o, connell, head, of, the, repeal, association, proposed, several, remedies, to, the, pending, disaster, one, of, the, first, things, he, suggested, was, the, introduction, of, tenant, right, as, practised, in, ulster, giving, the, landlord, a, fair, rent, for, his, land, but, giving, the, tenant, compensation, for, any, money, he, might, have, laid, out, on, the, land, in, permanent, improvements, o, connell, noted, actions, taken, by, the, belgian, legislature, during, the, same, season, as, they, had, also, been, hit, by, blight, shutting, their, ports, against, the, export, of, provisions, and, opening, them, to, imports, he, suggested, that, if, ireland, had, a, domestic, parliament, the, ports, would, be, thrown, open, and, the, abundant, crops, raised, in, ireland, would, be, kept, for, the, people, of, ireland, as, the, dublin, parliament, had, done, during, the, food, shortages, of, the, 1780s, o, connell, maintained, that, only, an, irish, parliament, would, provide, both, food, and, employment, for, the, people, he, said, that, repeal, of, the, act, of, union, was, a, necessity, and, ireland, s, only, hope, mitchel, later, wrote, one, of, the, first, widely, circulated, tracts, on, the, famine, the, last, conquest, of, ireland, perhaps, published, in, 1861, it, proposed, that, british, actions, during, the, famine, and, their, treatment, of, the, irish, were, a, deliberate, effort, at, genocide, it, contained, a, sentence, that, has, since, become, famous, the, almighty, indeed, sent, the, potato, blight, but, the, english, created, the, famine, mitchel, was, charged, with, sedition, because, of, his, writings, but, this, charge, was, dropped, he, was, convicted, by, a, packed, jury, under, the, newly, enacted, treason, felony, act, and, sentenced, to, 14, years, transportation, to, bermuda, according, to, charles, gavan, duffy, the, nation, insisted, that, the, proper, remedy, retaining, in, the, country, the, food, raised, by, her, people, until, the, people, were, fed, was, one, which, the, rest, of, europe, had, adopted, and, one, which, even, the, parliaments, of, the, pale, i, e, before, the, union, with, great, britain, in, 1801, had, adopted, in, periods, of, distress, contemporaneously, as, found, in, letters, from, the, period, and, in, particular, later, oral, memory, the, name, for, the, event, is, in, irish, an, drochshaol, though, with, the, earlier, spelling, standard, of, the, era, which, was, gaelic, script, it, is, found, written, as, in, dro, ao, al, in, the, modern, era, this, name, while, loosely, translated, as, the, hard, time, is, always, denoted, with, a, capital, letter, to, express, its, specific, historic, meaning, the, period, of, the, potato, blight, in, ireland, from, 1845, to, 1851, was, full, of, political, confrontation, a, more, radical, young, ireland, group, seceded, from, the, repeal, movement, in, july, 1846, and, attempted, an, armed, rebellion, in, 1848, it, was, unsuccessful, in, 1847, william, smith, o, brien, leader, of, the, young, ireland, party, became, one, of, the, founding, members, of, the, irish, confederation, to, campaign, for, a, repeal, of, the, act, of, union, and, called, for, the, export, of, grain, to, be, stopped, and, the, ports, closed, the, following, year, he, helped, organise, the, short, lived, young, irelander, rebellion, of, 1848, in, county, tipperary, when, ireland, experienced, food, shortages, in, 1782, 1783, ports, were, closed, to, exporting, food, with, the, intention, of, keeping, locally, grown, food, in, ireland, to, feed, the, hungry, irish, food, prices, promptly, dropped, some, merchants, lobbied, against, the, export, ban, but, the, government, in, the, 1780s, overrode, their, protests, historian, f, s, l, lyons, characterised, the, initial, response, of, the, british, government, to, the, early, less, severe, phase, of, the, famine, as, prompt, and, relatively, successful, confronted, by, widespread, crop, failure, in, november, 1845, the, prime, minister, sir, robert, peel, purchased, 100, 000, worth, of, maize, and, cornmeal, secretly, from, america, with, baring, brothers, initially, acting, as, his, agents, the, government, hoped, that, they, would, not, stifle, private, enterprise, and, that, their, actions, would, not, act, as, a, disincentive, to, local, relief, efforts, due, to, poor, weather, conditions, the, first, shipment, did, not, arrive, in, ireland, until, the, beginning, of, february, 1846, the, initial, shipments, were, of, unground, dried, kernels, but, the, few, irish, mills, in, operation, were, not, equipped, for, milling, maize, and, a, long, and, complicated, milling, process, had, to, be, adopted, before, the, meal, could, be, distributed, in, addition, before, the, cornmeal, could, be, consumed, it, had, to, be, very, much, cooked, again, or, eating, it, could, result, in, severe, bowel, complaints, due, to, its, yellow, colour, and, initial, unpopularity, it, became, known, as, peel, s, brimstone, in, october, 1845, peel, moved, to, repeal, the, corn, laws, tariffs, on, grain, which, kept, the, price, of, bread, high, but, the, issue, split, his, party, and, he, had, insufficient, support, from, his, own, colleagues, to, push, the, measure, through, he, resigned, the, premiership, in, december, but, the, opposition, was, unable, to, form, a, government, and, he, was, re, appointed, in, march, peel, set, up, a, programme, of, public, works, in, ireland, but, the, famine, situation, worsened, during, 1846, and, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, in, that, year, did, little, to, help, the, starving, irish, the, measure, split, the, conservative, party, leading, to, the, fall, of, peel, s, ministry, on, 25, june, the, second, reading, of, the, government, s, irish, coercion, bill, was, defeated, by, 73, votes, in, the, house, of, commons, by, a, combination, of, whigs, radicals, irish, repealers, and, protectionist, conservatives, peel, was, forced, to, resign, as, prime, minister, on, 29, june, and, the, whig, leader, lord, john, russell, became, prime, minister, the, measures, undertaken, by, peel, s, successor, russell, proved, inadequate, as, the, crisis, deepened, the, new, whig, administration, influenced, by, the, doctrine, of, laissez, faire, believed, that, the, market, would, provide, the, food, needed, they, refused, to, interfere, with, the, movement, of, food, to, england, and, then, halted, the, previous, government, s, food, and, relief, works, leaving, many, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, without, access, to, work, money, or, food, russell, s, ministry, introduced, a, new, programme, of, public, works, that, by, the, end, of, december, 1846, employed, some, half, a, million, but, proved, impossible, to, administer, charles, trevelyan, who, was, in, charge, of, the, administration, of, government, relief, limited, the, government, s, food, aid, programme, claiming, that, food, would, be, readily, imported, into, ireland, once, people, had, more, money, to, spend, after, wages, were, being, paid, on, new, public, works, projects, in, a, private, correspondence, trevelyan, explained, how, the, famine, could, bring, benefit, to, the, english, as, he, wrote, to, edward, twisleton, we, must, not, complain, of, what, we, really, want, to, obtain, if, small, farmers, go, and, their, landlords, are, reduced, to, sell, portions, of, their, estates, to, persons, who, will, invest, capital, we, shall, at, last, arrive, at, something, like, a, satisfactory, settlement, of, the, country, in, january, 1847, the, government, abandoned, its, policy, of, noninterference, realising, that, it, had, failed, and, turned, to, a, mixture, of, indoor, and, outdoor, direct, relief, the, former, administered, in, workhouses, through, the, irish, poor, laws, the, latter, through, soup, kitchens, the, costs, of, the, poor, law, fell, primarily, on, the, local, landlords, some, of, whom, in, turn, attempted, to, reduce, their, liability, by, evicting, their, tenants, or, providing, some, relief, through, the, conversionist, practice, of, souperism, on, 1, march, 1847, the, bank, of, england, announced, plans, to, raise, a, loan, of, 14, million, to, relieve, the, irish, crisis, and, also, for, unfunded, tax, cuts, this, led, to, the, panic, of, 1847, in, which, gold, was, withdrawn, from, circulation, so, reducing, the, amount, of, bank, notes, that, the, bank, could, legally, circulate, by, 17, april, 1847, the, bullion, reserve, of, the, bank, of, england, had, diminished, from, 15, million, in, january, to, some, 9, million, and, it, was, announced, that, the, cost, of, famine, relief, would, be, transferred, to, local, taxes, in, ireland, the, financial, crisis, temporarily, improved, but, the, intended, relief, for, ireland, did, not, materialise, in, june, 1847, the, poor, law, amendment, act, was, passed, which, embodied, the, principle, popular, in, britain, that, irish, property, must, support, irish, poverty, the, landed, proprietors, in, ireland, were, held, in, britain, to, have, created, the, conditions, that, led, to, the, famine, however, it, was, asserted, that, the, british, parliament, since, the, act, of, union, of, 1800, was, partly, to, blame, this, point, was, raised, in, the, illustrated, london, news, on, 13, february, 1847, there, was, no, law, it, would, not, pass, at, their, request, and, no, abuse, it, would, not, defend, for, them, on, 24, march, the, times, reported, that, britain, had, permitted, in, ireland, a, mass, of, poverty, disaffection, and, degradation, without, a, parallel, in, the, world, it, allowed, proprietors, to, suck, the, very, life, blood, of, that, wretched, race, the, gregory, clause, of, the, poor, law, named, after, william, h, gregory, m, p, prohibited, anyone, who, held, at, least, 1, 4, acre, 0, 1, ha, from, receiving, relief, in, practice, this, meant, that, the, many, farmers, who, had, to, sell, all, their, produce, to, pay, rent, and, taxes, would, have, to, deliver, up, all, their, land, to, the, landlord, to, qualify, for, public, outdoor, relief, of, this, law, mitchel, wrote, that, it, is, the, able, bodied, idler, only, who, is, to, be, fed, if, he, attempted, to, till, but, one, rood, of, ground, he, dies, this, simple, method, of, ejectment, was, called, passing, paupers, through, the, workhouse, a, man, went, in, a, pauper, came, out, these, factors, combined, to, drive, thousands, of, people, off, the, land, 90, 000, in, 1849, and, 104, 000, in, 1850, in, 1849, the, encumbered, estates, act, allowed, landlord, estates, to, be, auctioned, off, upon, the, petition, of, creditors, estates, with, debts, were, then, auctioned, off, at, low, prices, wealthy, british, speculators, purchased, the, lands, and, took, a, harsh, view, of, the, tenant, farmers, who, continued, renting, the, rents, were, raised, and, tenants, evicted, to, create, large, cattle, grazing, pastures, between, 1849, and, 1854, some, 50, 000, families, were, evicted, the, royal, navy, squadron, stationed, in, cork, under, the, command, of, rear, admiral, hugh, pigot, undertook, significant, relief, operations, from, 1846, to, 1847, transporting, government, relief, into, the, port, of, cork, and, other, ports, along, the, irish, coast, being, ordered, on, 2, january, 1846, to, assist, distressed, regions, on, 27, december, 1846, trevelyan, ordered, every, available, steamship, to, ireland, to, assist, in, relief, and, on, 14, january, 1847, pigot, received, orders, to, also, distribute, supplies, from, the, british, relief, association, and, treat, them, identically, to, government, aid, in, addition, some, naval, officers, under, pigot, oversaw, the, logistics, of, relief, operations, further, inland, from, cork, in, february, 1847, trevelyan, ordered, royal, navy, surgeons, dispatched, to, provide, medical, care, for, those, suffering, from, illnesses, that, accompanied, starvation, distribute, medicines, that, were, in, short, supply, and, assist, in, proper, sanitary, burials, for, the, deceased, these, efforts, although, significant, were, insufficient, at, preventing, mass, mortality, from, famine, and, disease, the, historian, cecil, woodham, smith, wrote, in, the, great, hunger, ireland, 1845, 1849, that, no, issue, has, provoked, so, much, anger, and, embittered, relations, between, england, and, ireland, as, the, indisputable, fact, that, huge, quantities, of, food, were, exported, from, ireland, to, england, throughout, the, period, when, the, people, of, ireland, were, dying, of, starvation, while, in, addition, to, the, maize, imports, four, times, as, much, wheat, was, imported, into, ireland, at, the, height, of, the, famine, as, exported, woodham, smith, added, that, provision, via, the, poor, law, union, workhouses, by, the, act, of, 1838, had, to, be, paid, by, rates, levied, on, the, local, property, owners, and, in, areas, where, the, famine, was, worst, the, tenants, could, not, pay, their, rents, to, enable, landlords, to, fund, the, rates, and, therefore, the, workhouses, only, by, selling, food, some, of, which, would, inevitably, be, exported, could, a, virtuous, circle, be, created, whereby, the, rents, and, rates, would, be, paid, and, the, workhouses, funded, relief, through, the, workhouse, system, was, simply, overwhelmed, by, the, enormous, scale, and, duration, of, the, famine, nicolas, mcevoy, parish, priest, of, kells, wrote, in, october, 1845, on, my, most, minute, personal, inspection, of, the, potato, crop, in, this, most, fertile, potato, growing, locale, is, founded, my, inexpressibly, painful, conviction, that, one, family, in, twenty, of, the, people, will, not, have, a, single, potato, left, on, christmas, day, next, many, are, the, fields, i, have, examined, and, testimony, the, most, solemn, can, i, tender, that, in, the, great, bulk, of, those, fields, all, the, potatoes, sizable, enough, to, be, sent, to, table, are, irreparably, damaged, while, for, the, remaining, comparatively, sounder, fields, very, little, hopes, are, entertained, in, consequence, of, the, daily, rapid, development, of, the, deplorable, disease, with, starvation, at, our, doors, grimly, staring, us, vessels, laden, with, our, sole, hopes, of, existence, our, provisions, are, hourly, wafted, from, our, every, port, from, one, milling, establishment, i, have, last, night, seen, not, less, than, fifty, dray, loads, of, meal, moving, on, to, drogheda, thence, to, go, to, feed, the, foreigner, leaving, starvation, and, death, the, sure, and, certain, fate, of, the, toil, and, sweat, that, raised, this, food, for, their, respective, inhabitants, england, holland, scotland, germany, are, taking, early, the, necessary, precautions, getting, provisions, from, every, possible, part, of, the, globe, and, i, ask, are, irishmen, alone, unworthy, the, sympathies, of, a, paternal, gentry, or, a, paternal, government, let, irishmen, themselves, take, heed, before, the, provisions, are, gone, let, those, too, who, have, sheep, and, oxen, and, haggards, self, preservation, is, the, first, law, of, nature, the, right, of, the, starving, to, try, and, sustain, existence, is, a, right, far, and, away, paramount, to, every, right, that, property, confers, infinitely, more, precious, in, the, eyes, of, reason, in, the, adorable, eye, of, the, omnipotent, creator, is, the, life, of, the, last, and, least, of, human, beings, than, the, whole, united, property, of, the, entire, universe, the, appalling, character, of, the, crisis, renders, delicacy, but, criminal, and, imperatively, calls, for, the, timely, and, explicit, notice, of, principles, that, will, not, fail, to, prove, terrible, arms, in, the, hands, of, a, neglected, abandoned, starving, people, in, the, 5, may, 2020, issue, of, the, dublin, review, of, books, editor, maurice, earls, wrote, dr, mcevoy, in, his, grim, forebodings, and, apocalyptic, fear, was, closer, to, the, truth, than, the, sanguine, rationalists, quoted, in, the, newspapers, but, mcevoy, like, many, others, overestimated, the, likelihood, of, mass, rebellion, and, even, this, great, clerical, friend, of, the, poor, could, hardly, have, contemplated, the, depth, of, social, economic, and, cultural, destruction, which, would, persist, and, deepen, over, the, following, century, and, beyond, it, was, politics, that, turned, a, disease, of, potatoes, and, tomatoes, into, famine, and, it, was, politics, which, ensured, its, disastrous, aftereffects, would, disfigure, numerous, future, generations, according, to, historian, james, donnelly, the, picture, of, irish, people, starving, as, food, was, exported, was, the, most, powerful, image, in, the, nationalist, construct, of, the, famine, grain, imports, increased, after, the, spring, of, 1847, and, much, of, the, debate, has, been, conducted, within, narrow, parameters, focusing, almost, exclusively, on, national, estimates, with, little, attempt, to, disaggregate, the, data, by, region, or, by, product, total, charitable, donations, for, famine, relief, might, have, been, about, 1, 5, million, of, which, 856, 500, came, from, outside, ireland, donations, within, ireland, are, harder, to, trace, 380, 000, of, donations, were, officially, registered, but, once, some, allowance, is, made, for, less, formal, donations, the, irish, total, probably, exceeds, that, of, britain, 525, 000, people, of, irish, descent, also, contributed, to, funds, raised, outside, of, ireland, and, those, donations, would, be, included, in, the, region, where, the, donation, was, made, english, protestants, donated, more, to, irish, famine, relief, than, any, other, source, outside, of, ireland, 224, 227, large, sums, of, money, were, donated, by, charities, the, first, foreign, campaign, in, december, 1845, included, the, boston, repeal, association, and, the, catholic, church, calcutta, is, credited, with, making, the, first, larger, donations, in, 1846, summing, up, to, around, 14, 000, the, money, raised, included, contributions, by, irish, soldiers, serving, there, and, irish, people, employed, by, the, east, india, company, russian, tsar, alexander, ii, sent, funds, and, queen, victoria, donated, 2, 000, according, to, legend, sultan, abd, lmecid, i, of, the, ottoman, empire, originally, offered, to, send, 10, 000, but, was, asked, either, by, british, diplomats, or, his, own, ministers, to, reduce, it, to, 1, 000, to, avoid, donating, more, than, the, queen, u, s, president, james, k, polk, donated, 50, and, in, 1847, congressman, abraham, lincoln, donated, 10, 307, in, 2019, value, pope, pius, ix, also, made, a, personal, contribution, of, 1, 000, scudi, approximately, 213, for, famine, relief, in, ireland, and, authorized, collections, in, rome, most, significantly, on, 25, march, 1847, pius, ix, issued, the, encyclical, praedecessores, nostros, which, called, the, whole, catholic, world, to, contribute, moneywise, and, spiritually, to, irish, relief, major, figures, behind, international, catholic, fundraising, for, ireland, were, the, rector, of, the, pontifical, irish, college, paul, cullen, and, the, president, of, the, society, of, saint, vincent, de, paul, jules, gossin, international, fundraising, activities, received, donations, from, locations, as, diverse, as, venezuela, australia, south, africa, mexico, russia, and, italy, in, addition, to, the, religious, non, religious, organisations, came, to, the, assistance, of, famine, victims, the, british, relief, association, was, the, largest, of, these, groups, founded, on, 1, january, 1847, by, lionel, de, rothschild, abel, smith, and, other, prominent, bankers, and, aristocrats, the, association, raised, money, throughout, england, america, and, australia, their, funding, drive, was, benefited, by, a, queen, s, letter, a, letter, from, queen, victoria, appealing, for, money, to, relieve, the, distress, in, ireland, with, this, initial, letter, the, association, raised, 171, 533, a, second, somewhat, less, successful, queen, s, letter, was, issued, in, late, 1847, in, total, the, association, raised, approximately, 390, 000, for, irish, relief, private, initiatives, such, as, the, central, relief, committee, of, the, society, of, friends, quakers, attempted, to, fill, the, gap, caused, by, the, end, of, government, relief, and, eventually, the, government, reinstated, the, relief, works, although, bureaucracy, slowed, the, release, of, food, supplies, thousands, of, dollars, were, raised, in, the, united, states, including, 170, 5, 218, in, 2019, value, collected, from, a, group, of, native, american, choctaws, in, 1847, judy, allen, editor, of, the, choctaw, nation, of, oklahoma, s, newspaper, biskinik, wrote, that, it, had, been, just, 16, years, since, the, choctaw, people, had, experienced, the, trail, of, tears, and, they, had, faced, starvation, it, was, an, amazing, gesture, to, mark, the, 150th, anniversary, eight, irish, people, retraced, the, trail, of, tears, contributions, by, the, united, states, during, the, famine, were, highlighted, by, senator, henry, clay, who, said, no, imagination, can, conceive, no, tongue, express, no, brush, paint, the, horrors, of, the, scenes, which, are, daily, exhibited, in, ireland, he, called, upon, americans, to, remind, them, that, the, practice, of, charity, was, the, greatest, act, of, humanity, they, could, do, in, total, 118, vessels, sailed, from, the, us, to, ireland, with, relief, goods, valued, at, 545, 145, specific, states, which, provided, aid, include, south, carolina, and, philadelphia, pennsylvania, pennsylvania, was, the, second, most, important, state, for, famine, relief, in, the, us, and, the, second, largest, shipping, port, for, aid, to, ireland, the, state, hosted, the, philadelphia, irish, famine, relief, committee, catholics, methodists, quakers, presbyterians, episcopalians, lutherans, moravian, and, jewish, groups, put, aside, their, differences, in, the, name, of, humanity, to, help, out, the, irish, south, carolina, rallied, around, the, efforts, to, help, those, experiencing, the, famine, they, raised, donations, of, money, food, and, clothing, to, help, the, victims, of, the, famine, irish, immigrants, made, up, 39, of, the, white, population, in, the, southern, cities, historian, harvey, strum, claims, that, the, states, ignored, all, their, racial, religious, and, political, differences, to, support, the, cause, for, relief, landlords, were, responsible, for, paying, the, rates, of, every, tenant, whose, yearly, rent, was, 4, or, less, landlords, whose, land, was, crowded, with, poorer, tenants, were, now, faced, with, large, bills, many, began, clearing, the, poor, tenants, from, their, small, plots, and, letting, the, land, in, larger, plots, for, over, 4, which, then, reduced, their, debts, in, 1846, there, had, been, some, clearances, but, the, great, mass, of, evictions, came, in, 1847, according, to, james, s, donnelly, jr, it, is, impossible, to, be, sure, how, many, people, were, evicted, during, the, years, of, the, famine, and, its, immediate, aftermath, it, was, only, in, 1849, that, the, police, began, to, keep, a, count, and, they, recorded, a, total, of, almost, 250, 000, persons, as, officially, evicted, between, 1849, and, 1854, donnelly, considered, this, to, be, an, underestimate, and, if, the, figures, were, to, include, the, number, pressured, into, voluntary, surrenders, during, the, whole, period, 1846, 1854, the, figure, would, almost, certainly, exceed, half, a, million, persons, while, helen, litton, says, there, were, also, thousands, of, voluntary, surrenders, she, notes, also, that, there, was, precious, little, voluntary, about, them, in, some, cases, tenants, were, persuaded, to, accept, a, small, sum, of, money, to, leave, their, homes, cheated, into, believing, the, workhouse, would, take, them, in, west, clare, was, one, of, the, worst, areas, for, evictions, where, landlords, turned, thousands, of, families, out, and, demolished, their, derisory, cabins, captain, kennedy, in, april, 1848, estimated, that, 1, 000, houses, with, an, average, of, six, people, to, each, had, been, levelled, since, november, the, mahon, family, of, strokestown, house, evicted, 3, 000, people, in, 1847, and, were, still, able, to, dine, on, lobster, soup, after, clare, the, worst, area, for, evictions, was, county, mayo, accounting, for, 10, of, all, evictions, between, 1849, and, 1854, george, bingham, 3rd, earl, of, lucan, who, owned, over, 60, 000, acres, 240, km, 2, was, among, the, worst, evicting, landlords, he, was, quoted, as, saying, that, he, would, not, breed, paupers, to, pay, priests, having, turned, out, in, the, parish, of, ballinrobe, over, 2, 000, tenants, alone, he, then, used, the, cleared, land, as, grazing, farms, in, 1848, the, marquis, of, sligo, owed, 1, 650, to, westport, union, he, was, also, an, evicting, landlord, though, he, claimed, to, be, selective, saying, that, he, was, only, getting, rid, of, the, idle, and, dishonest, altogether, he, cleared, about, 25, of, his, tenants, in, 1847, bishop, of, meath, thomas, nulty, described, his, personal, recollection, of, the, evictions, in, a, pastoral, letter, to, his, clergy, seven, hundred, human, beings, were, driven, from, their, homes, in, one, day, and, set, adrift, on, the, world, to, gratify, the, caprice, of, one, who, before, god, and, man, probably, deserved, less, consideration, than, the, last, and, least, of, them, the, horrid, scenes, i, then, witnessed, i, must, remember, all, my, life, long, the, wailing, of, women, the, screams, the, terror, the, consternation, of, children, the, speechless, agony, of, honest, industrious, men, wrung, tears, of, grief, from, all, who, saw, them, i, saw, officers, and, men, of, a, large, police, force, who, were, obliged, to, attend, on, the, occasion, cry, like, children, at, beholding, the, cruel, sufferings, of, the, very, people, whom, they, would, be, obliged, to, butcher, had, they, offered, the, least, resistance, the, landed, proprietors, in, a, circle, all, around, and, for, many, miles, in, every, direction, warned, their, tenantry, with, threats, of, their, direct, vengeance, against, the, humanity, of, extending, to, any, of, them, the, hospitality, of, a, single, night, s, shelter, and, in, little, more, than, three, years, nearly, a, fourth, of, them, lay, quietly, in, their, graves, the, population, in, drumbaragh, a, townland, in, county, meath, plummeted, 67, per, cent, between, 1841, and, 1851, in, neighbouring, springville, it, fell, 54, per, cent, there, were, fifty, houses, in, springville, in, 1841, and, only, eleven, left, in, 1871, according, to, litton, evictions, might, have, taken, place, earlier, but, for, fear, of, the, secret, societies, however, they, were, now, greatly, weakened, by, the, famine, revenge, still, occasionally, took, place, with, seven, landlords, being, shot, six, fatally, during, the, autumn, and, winter, of, 1847, ten, other, occupiers, of, land, though, without, tenants, were, also, murdered, she, says, one, such, landlord, reprisal, occurred, in, west, roscommon, the, notorious, major, denis, mahon, enforced, thousands, of, his, tenants, into, eviction, before, the, end, of, 1847, with, an, estimated, 60, per, cent, decline, in, population, in, some, parishes, he, was, shot, dead, in, that, year, in, east, roscommon, where, conditions, were, more, benign, the, estimated, decline, in, population, was, under, 10, percent, lord, clarendon, alarmed, at, the, number, of, landlords, being, shot, and, that, this, might, mean, rebellion, asked, for, special, powers, lord, john, russell, was, not, sympathetic, to, this, appeal, lord, clarendon, believed, that, the, landlords, themselves, were, mostly, responsible, for, the, tragedy, in, the, first, place, saying, that, it, is, quite, true, that, landlords, in, england, would, not, like, to, be, shot, like, hares, and, partridges, but, neither, does, any, landlord, in, england, turn, out, fifty, persons, at, once, and, burn, their, houses, over, their, heads, giving, them, no, provision, for, the, future, the, crime, and, outrage, act, was, passed, in, december, 1847, as, a, compromise, and, additional, troops, were, sent, to, ireland, the, gregory, clause, described, by, donnelly, as, a, vicious, amendment, to, the, irish, poor, law, had, been, a, successful, tory, amendment, to, the, whig, poor, relief, bill, which, became, law, in, early, june, 1847, where, its, potential, as, an, estate, clearing, device, was, widely, recognised, in, parliament, although, not, in, advance, at, first, the, poor, law, commissioners, and, inspectors, viewed, the, clause, as, a, valuable, instrument, for, a, more, cost, effective, administration, of, public, relief, but, the, drawbacks, soon, became, apparent, even, from, an, administrative, perspective, they, would, soon, view, them, as, little, more, than, murderous, from, a, humanitarian, perspective, according, to, donnelly, it, became, obvious, that, the, quarter, acre, clause, was, indirectly, a, death, dealing, instrument, at, least, a, million, people, are, thought, to, have, emigrated, as, a, result, of, the, famine, there, were, about, 1, million, long, distance, emigrants, between, 1846, and, 1851, mainly, to, north, america, the, total, given, in, the, 1851, census, is, 967, 908, short, distance, emigrants, mainly, to, britain, may, have, numbered, 200, 000, or, more, while, the, famine, was, responsible, for, a, significant, increase, in, emigration, from, ireland, of, anywhere, from, 45, to, nearly, 85, depending, on, the, year, and, the, county, it, was, not, the, sole, cause, the, beginning, of, mass, emigration, from, ireland, can, be, traced, to, the, mid, 18th, century, when, some, 250, 000, people, left, ireland, over, a, period, of, 50, years, to, settle, in, the, new, world, irish, economist, cormac, gr, da, estimates, that, between, 1, million, and, 1, 5, million, people, emigrated, during, the, 30, years, between, 1815, when, napoleon, was, defeated, in, waterloo, and, 1845, when, the, great, famine, began, however, during, the, worst, of, the, famine, emigration, reached, somewhere, around, 250, 000, in, one, year, alone, with, western, ireland, seeing, the, most, emigrants, families, did, not, migrate, en, masse, but, younger, members, of, families, did, so, much, so, that, emigration, almost, became, a, rite, of, passage, as, evidenced, by, the, data, that, show, that, unlike, similar, emigrations, throughout, world, history, women, emigrated, just, as, often, just, as, early, and, in, the, same, numbers, as, men, the, emigrants, would, send, remittances, reaching, a, total, of, 1, 404, 000, by, 1851, back, to, family, in, ireland, which, in, turn, allowed, another, member, of, their, family, to, leave, emigration, during, the, famine, years, of, 1845, 1850, was, primarily, to, england, scotland, south, wales, north, america, and, australia, many, of, those, fleeing, to, the, americas, used, the, mccorkell, line, one, city, that, experienced, a, particularly, strong, influx, of, irish, immigrants, was, liverpool, with, at, least, one, quarter, of, the, city, s, population, being, irish, born, by, 1851, this, would, heavily, influence, the, city, s, identity, and, culture, in, the, coming, years, earning, it, the, nickname, of, ireland, s, second, capital, liverpool, became, the, only, place, outside, of, ireland, to, elect, an, irish, nationalist, to, parliament, when, it, elected, t, p, o, connor, in, 1885, and, continuously, re, elected, him, unopposed, until, his, death, in, 1929, as, of, 2020, it, is, estimated, that, three, quarters, of, people, from, the, city, have, irish, ancestry, of, the, more, than, 100, 000, irish, that, sailed, to, canada, in, 1847, an, estimated, one, out, of, five, died, from, disease, and, malnutrition, including, over, 5, 000, at, grosse, isle, quebec, an, island, in, the, saint, lawrence, river, used, to, quarantine, ships, near, quebec, city, overcrowded, poorly, maintained, and, badly, provisioned, vessels, known, as, coffin, ships, sailed, from, small, unregulated, harbours, in, the, west, of, ireland, in, contravention, of, british, safety, requirements, and, mortality, rates, were, high, the, 1851, census, reported, that, more, than, half, the, inhabitants, of, toronto, were, irish, and, in, 1847, alone, 38, 000, irish, flooded, a, city, with, fewer, than, 20, 000, citizens, other, canadian, cities, such, as, quebec, city, montreal, ottawa, kingston, hamilton, and, saint, john, also, received, large, numbers, by, 1871, 55, of, saint, john, residents, were, irish, natives, or, children, of, irish, born, parents, unlike, the, united, states, canada, could, not, close, its, ports, to, irish, ships, because, it, was, part, of, the, british, empire, so, emigrants, could, obtain, cheap, passage, in, returning, empty, lumber, holds, in, america, most, irish, became, city, dwellers, with, little, money, many, had, to, settle, in, the, cities, that, the, ships, they, came, on, landed, in, by, 1850, the, irish, made, up, a, quarter, of, the, population, in, boston, new, york, city, philadelphia, and, baltimore, the, famine, marked, the, beginning, of, the, depopulation, of, ireland, in, the, 19th, century, the, population, had, increased, by, 13, 14, in, the, first, three, decades, of, the, 19th, century, between, 1831, and, 1841, the, population, grew, by, 5, application, of, thomas, malthus, s, idea, of, population, expanding, geometrically, while, resources, increase, arithmetically, was, popular, during, the, famines, of, 1817, and, 1822, by, the, 1830s, they, were, seen, as, overly, simplistic, and, ireland, s, problems, were, seen, less, as, an, excess, of, population, than, as, a, lack, of, capital, investment, the, population, of, ireland, was, increasing, no, faster, than, that, of, england, which, suffered, no, equivalent, catastrophe, by, 1854, between, 1, 5, and, 2, million, irish, left, their, country, due, to, evictions, starvation, and, harsh, living, conditions, it, is, not, known, exactly, how, many, people, died, during, the, period, of, the, famine, although, it, is, believed, that, more, died, from, disease, than, from, starvation, state, registration, of, births, marriages, or, deaths, had, not, yet, begun, and, records, kept, by, the, catholic, church, are, incomplete, one, possible, estimate, has, been, reached, by, comparing, the, expected, population, with, the, eventual, numbers, in, the, 1850s, a, census, taken, in, 1841, recorded, a, population, of, 8, 175, 124, a, census, immediately, after, the, famine, in, 1851, counted, 6, 552, 385, a, drop, of, over, 1, 5, million, in, 10, years, the, census, commissioners, estimated, that, at, the, normal, rate, of, population, increase, the, population, in, 1851, should, have, grown, to, just, over, 9, million, if, the, famine, had, not, occurred, on, the, in, development, great, irish, famine, online, resource, produced, by, the, geography, department, of, university, college, cork, the, population, of, ireland, section, states, that, together, with, the, census, figures, being, called, low, before, the, famine, it, reads, that, it, is, now, generally, believed, that, over, 8, 75, million, people, populated, the, island, of, ireland, prior, to, it, striking, in, 1851, the, census, commissioners, collected, information, on, the, number, who, died, in, each, family, since, 1841, and, the, cause, season, and, year, of, death, they, recorded, 21, 770, total, deaths, from, starvation, in, the, previous, decade, and, 400, 720, deaths, from, diseases, listed, diseases, were, fever, diphtheria, dysentery, cholera, smallpox, and, influenza, with, the, first, two, being, the, main, killers, 222, 021, and, 93, 232, the, commissioners, acknowledged, that, their, figures, were, incomplete, and, that, the, true, number, of, deaths, was, probably, higher, the, greater, the, amount, of, destitution, of, mortality, the, less, will, be, the, amount, of, recorded, deaths, derived, through, any, household, form, for, not, only, were, whole, families, swept, away, by, disease, but, whole, villages, were, effaced, from, off, the, land, later, historians, agree, that, the, 1851, death, tables, were, flawed, and, probably, under, estimated, the, level, of, mortality, the, combination, of, institutional, and, figures, provided, by, individuals, gives, an, incomplete, and, biased, count, of, fatalities, during, the, famine, cormac, gr, da, referencing, the, work, of, w, a, macarthur, writes, that, specialists, have, long, known, that, the, irish, death, tables, were, inaccurate, and, undercounted, the, number, of, deaths, s, h, cousens, s, estimate, of, 800, 000, deaths, relied, heavily, on, retrospective, information, contained, in, the, 1851, census, and, elsewhere, and, is, now, regarded, as, too, low, modern, historian, j, j, lee, says, at, least, 800, 000, and, r, f, foster, estimates, that, at, least, 775, 000, died, mostly, through, disease, including, cholera, in, the, latter, stages, of, the, holocaust, he, further, notes, that, a, recent, sophisticated, computation, estimates, excess, deaths, from, 1846, to, 1851, as, between, 1, 000, 000, and, 1, 500, 000, after, a, careful, critique, of, this, other, statisticians, arrive, at, a, figure, of, 1, 000, 000, joel, mokyr, s, estimates, at, an, aggregated, county, level, range, from, 1, 1, million, to, 1, 5, million, deaths, between, 1846, and, 1851, mokyr, produced, two, sets, of, data, which, contained, an, upper, bound, and, lower, bound, estimate, which, showed, not, much, difference, in, regional, patterns, the, true, figure, is, likely, to, lie, between, the, two, extremes, of, half, and, one, and, a, half, million, and, the, most, widely, accepted, estimate, is, one, million, detailed, statistics, of, the, population, of, ireland, since, 1841, are, available, at, irish, population, analysis, another, area, of, uncertainty, lies, in, the, descriptions, of, disease, given, by, tenants, as, to, the, cause, of, their, relatives, deaths, though, the, 1851, census, has, been, rightly, criticised, as, underestimating, the, true, extent, of, mortality, it, does, provide, a, framework, for, the, medical, history, of, the, great, famine, the, diseases, that, badly, affected, the, population, fell, into, two, categories, famine, induced, diseases, and, diseases, of, nutritional, deficiency, of, the, nutritional, deficiency, diseases, the, most, commonly, experienced, were, starvation, and, marasmus, as, well, as, a, condition, at, the, time, called, dropsy, dropsy, oedema, was, a, popular, name, given, for, the, symptoms, of, several, diseases, one, of, which, kwashiorkor, is, associated, with, starvation, however, the, greatest, mortality, was, not, from, nutritional, deficiency, diseases, but, from, famine, induced, ailments, the, malnourished, are, very, vulnerable, to, infections, therefore, these, were, more, severe, when, they, occurred, measles, diphtheria, diarrhoea, tuberculosis, most, respiratory, infections, whooping, cough, many, intestinal, parasites, and, cholera, were, all, strongly, conditioned, by, nutritional, status, potentially, lethal, diseases, such, as, smallpox, and, influenza, were, so, virulent, that, their, spread, was, independent, of, nutrition, the, best, example, of, this, phenomenon, was, fever, which, exacted, the, greatest, death, toll, in, the, popular, mind, as, well, as, medical, opinion, fever, and, famine, were, closely, related, social, dislocation, the, congregation, of, the, hungry, at, soup, kitchens, food, depots, and, overcrowded, workhouses, created, conditions, that, were, ideal, for, spreading, infectious, diseases, such, as, typhus, typhoid, and, relapsing, fever, diarrhoeal, diseases, were, the, result, of, poor, hygiene, bad, sanitation, and, dietary, changes, the, concluding, attack, on, a, population, incapacitated, by, famine, was, delivered, by, asiatic, cholera, which, had, visited, ireland, briefly, in, the, 1830s, in, the, following, decade, it, spread, uncontrollably, across, asia, through, europe, and, into, britain, finally, reaching, ireland, in, 1849, some, scholars, estimate, that, the, population, of, ireland, was, reduced, by, 20, 25, ireland, s, mean, age, of, marriage, in, 1830, was, 23, 8, for, women, and, 27, 5, for, men, where, they, had, once, been, 21, for, women, and, 25, for, men, and, those, who, never, married, numbered, about, 10, of, the, population, in, 1840, they, had, respectively, risen, to, 24, 4, and, 27, 7, in, the, decades, after, the, famine, the, age, of, marriage, had, risen, to, 28, 29, for, women, and, 33, for, men, and, as, many, as, a, third, of, irishmen, and, a, quarter, of, irishwomen, never, married, due, to, low, wages, and, chronic, economic, problems, that, discouraged, early, and, universal, marriage, one, consequence, of, the, increase, in, the, number, of, orphaned, children, was, that, some, young, women, turned, to, prostitution, to, provide, for, themselves, some, of, the, women, who, became, wrens, of, the, curragh, were, famine, orphans, the, potato, blight, would, return, to, ireland, in, 1879, though, by, then, the, rural, cottier, tenant, farmers, and, labourers, of, ireland, had, begun, the, land, war, described, as, one, of, the, largest, agrarian, movements, to, take, place, in, nineteenth, century, europe, by, the, time, the, potato, blight, returned, in, 1879, the, land, league, which, was, led, by, michael, davitt, who, was, born, during, the, great, famine, and, whose, family, had, been, evicted, when, davitt, was, only, 4, years, old, encouraged, the, mass, boycott, of, notorious, landlords, with, some, members, also, physically, blocking, evictions, the, policy, however, would, soon, be, suppressed, despite, close, to, 1000, interned, under, the, 1881, coercion, act, for, suspected, membership, with, the, reduction, in, the, rate, of, homelessness, and, the, increased, physical, and, political, networks, eroding, the, landlordism, system, the, severity, of, the, following, shorter, famine, would, be, limited, according, to, the, linguist, erick, falc, her, poyroux, surprisingly, for, a, country, renowned, for, its, rich, musical, heritage, only, a, small, number, of, folk, songs, can, be, traced, back, to, the, demographic, and, cultural, catastrophe, brought, about, by, the, great, famine, and, he, infers, from, this, that, the, subject, was, generally, avoided, for, decades, among, poorer, people, as, it, brought, back, too, many, sorrowful, memories, also, large, areas, of, the, country, became, uninhabited, and, the, folk, song, collectors, of, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, did, not, collect, the, songs, they, heard, in, the, irish, language, as, the, language, of, the, peasantry, was, often, regarded, as, dead, or, not, delicate, enough, for, educated, ears, of, the, songs, that, have, survived, probably, the, best, known, is, skibbereen, emigration, has, been, an, important, source, of, inspiration, for, songs, of, the, irish, during, the, 20th, century, contemporary, opinion, was, sharply, critical, of, the, russell, government, s, response, to, and, management, of, the, crisis, from, the, start, there, were, accusations, that, the, government, failed, to, grasp, the, magnitude, of, the, disaster, sir, james, graham, who, had, served, as, home, secretary, in, sir, robert, peel, s, late, government, wrote, to, peel, that, in, his, opinion, the, real, extent, and, magnitude, of, the, irish, difficulty, are, underestimated, by, the, government, and, cannot, be, met, by, measures, within, the, strict, rule, of, economical, science, this, criticism, was, not, confined, to, outside, critics, the, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, lord, clarendon, wrote, a, letter, to, russell, on, 26, april, 1849, urging, that, the, government, propose, additional, relief, measures, i, don, t, think, there, is, another, legislature, in, europe, that, would, disregard, such, suffering, as, now, exists, in, the, west, of, ireland, or, coldly, persist, in, a, policy, of, extermination, also, in, 1849, the, chief, poor, law, commissioner, edward, twisleton, resigned, in, protest, over, the, rate, in, aid, act, which, provided, additional, funds, for, the, poor, law, through, a, 6d, in, the, pound, levy, on, all, rateable, properties, in, ireland, twisleton, testified, that, comparatively, trifling, sums, were, required, for, britain, to, spare, itself, the, deep, disgrace, of, permitting, its, miserable, fellow, subjects, to, die, of, starvation, according, to, peter, gray, in, his, book, the, irish, famine, the, government, spent, 7, million, for, relief, in, ireland, between, 1845, and, 1850, representing, less, than, half, of, one, per, cent, of, the, british, gross, national, product, over, five, years, contemporaries, noted, the, sharp, contrast, with, the, 20, million, compensation, given, to, west, indian, slave, owners, in, the, 1830s, other, critics, maintained, that, even, after, the, government, recognised, the, scope, of, the, crisis, it, failed, to, take, sufficient, steps, to, address, it, john, mitchel, one, of, the, leaders, of, the, young, ireland, movement, wrote, in, 1860, i, have, called, it, an, artificial, famine, that, is, to, say, it, was, a, famine, which, desolated, a, rich, and, fertile, island, that, produced, every, year, abundance, and, superabundance, to, sustain, all, her, people, and, many, more, the, english, indeed, call, the, famine, a, dispensation, of, providence, and, ascribe, it, entirely, to, the, blight, on, potatoes, but, potatoes, failed, in, like, manner, all, over, europe, yet, there, was, no, famine, save, in, ireland, the, british, account, of, the, matter, then, is, first, a, fraud, second, a, blasphemy, the, almighty, indeed, sent, the, potato, blight, but, the, english, created, the, famine, still, other, critics, saw, reflected, in, the, government, s, response, its, attitude, to, the, so, called, irish, question, nassau, senior, an, economics, professor, at, oxford, university, wrote, that, the, famine, would, not, kill, more, than, one, million, people, and, that, would, scarcely, be, enough, to, do, any, good, in, 1848, denis, shine, lawlor, suggested, that, russell, was, a, student, of, the, elizabethan, poet, edmund, spenser, who, had, calculated, how, far, english, colonisation, and, english, policy, might, be, most, effectively, carried, out, by, irish, starvation, charles, trevelyan, the, civil, servant, with, most, direct, responsibility, for, the, government, s, handling, of, the, famine, described, it, in, 1848, as, a, direct, stroke, of, an, all, wise, and, all, merciful, providence, which, laid, bare, the, deep, and, inveterate, root, of, social, evil, he, affirmed, that, the, famine, was, the, sharp, but, effectual, remedy, by, which, the, cure, is, likely, to, be, effected, god, grant, that, the, generation, to, which, this, opportunity, has, been, offered, may, rightly, perform, its, part, christine, kinealy, has, written, that, the, major, tragedy, of, the, irish, famine, of, 1845, 1852, marked, a, watershed, in, modern, irish, history, its, occurrence, however, was, neither, inevitable, nor, unavoidable, the, underlying, factors, which, combined, to, cause, the, famine, were, aggravated, by, an, inadequate, government, response, kinealy, notes, that, the, government, had, to, do, something, to, help, alleviate, the, suffering, but, that, it, became, apparent, that, the, government, was, using, its, information, not, merely, to, help, it, formulate, its, relief, policies, but, also, as, an, opportunity, to, facilitate, various, long, desired, changes, within, ireland, joel, mokyr, writes, that, there, is, no, doubt, that, britain, could, have, saved, ireland, and, compares, the, 9, 5, million, the, government, spent, on, famine, relief, in, ireland, to, the, 63, 9, million, it, would, spend, a, few, years, later, on, the, utterly, futile, crimean, war, mokyr, argues, that, despite, its, formal, integration, into, the, united, kingdom, ireland, was, effectively, a, foreign, country, to, the, british, who, were, therefore, unwilling, to, spend, resources, that, could, have, saved, hundreds, of, thousands, of, lives, some, also, pointed, to, the, structure, of, the, british, empire, as, a, contributing, factor, james, anthony, froude, wrote, that, england, governed, ireland, for, what, she, deemed, her, own, interest, making, her, calculations, on, the, gross, balance, of, her, trade, ledgers, and, leaving, moral, obligations, aside, as, if, right, and, wrong, had, been, blotted, out, of, the, statute, book, of, the, universe, dennis, clark, an, irish, american, historian, and, critic, of, empire, claimed, the, famine, was, the, culmination, of, generations, of, neglect, misrule, and, repression, it, was, an, epic, of, english, colonial, cruelty, and, inadequacy, for, the, landless, cabin, dwellers, it, meant, emigration, or, extinction, the, british, government, has, not, expressly, apologized, for, its, role, in, the, famine, but, in, 1997, at, a, commemoration, event, in, county, cork, the, actor, gabriel, byrne, read, out, a, message, by, prime, minister, tony, blair, that, acknowledged, the, inadequacy, of, the, government, response, it, asserted, that, those, who, governed, in, london, at, the, time, failed, their, people, through, standing, by, while, a, crop, failure, turned, into, a, massive, human, tragedy, the, message, was, well, received, in, ireland, where, it, was, understood, as, the, long, sought, after, british, apology, archive, documents, released, in, 2021, showed, that, the, message, was, not, in, fact, written, or, approved, by, blair, who, could, not, be, reached, by, aides, at, the, time, it, was, therefore, approved, by, blair, s, principal, private, secretary, john, holmes, on, his, own, initiative, the, vast, majority, of, historians, reject, the, claim, that, the, british, government, s, response, to, the, famine, constituted, a, genocide, their, position, is, partially, based, on, the, fact, that, with, regard, to, famine, related, deaths, there, was, a, lack, of, intent, to, commit, genocide, for, a, mass, death, atrocity, to, be, defined, as, a, genocide, it, must, include, the, intentional, destruction, of, a, people, contemporary, commentators, blamed, the, mass, death, on, the, actions, of, the, british, government, rather, than, the, blight, in, 1996, the, u, s, state, of, new, jersey, included, the, famine, in, the, holocaust, and, genocide, curriculum, of, its, secondary, schools, in, the, 1990s, irish, american, lobbying, groups, campaigned, vigorously, to, include, the, study, of, the, irish, famine, in, school, curriculums, alongside, studies, of, the, holocaust, slavery, and, other, similar, atrocities, the, new, jersey, curriculum, was, pushed, by, such, lobbying, groups, and, was, drafted, by, the, librarian, james, mullin, following, criticism, the, new, jersey, holocaust, commission, requested, statements, from, two, academics, that, the, irish, famine, was, genocide, which, was, eventually, provided, by, law, professors, charles, e, rice, and, francis, boyle, who, had, not, been, previously, known, for, studying, irish, history, they, concluded, that, the, british, government, deliberately, pursued, a, race, and, ethnicity, based, policy, aimed, at, destroying, the, irish, people, and, that, the, policy, of, mass, starvation, amounted, to, genocide, per, retrospective, application, of, article, 2, of, the, hague, convention, of, 1948, historian, donald, akenson, who, has, written, 24, books, on, ireland, stated, that, when, you, see, you, know, that, you, are, encountering, famine, porn, it, is, inevitably, part, of, a, presentation, that, is, historically, unbalanced, and, like, other, kinds, of, pornography, is, distinguished, by, a, covert, and, sometimes, overt, appeal, to, misanthropy, and, almost, always, an, incitement, to, hatred, irish, historian, cormac, gr, da, rejected, the, claim, that, the, british, government, s, response, to, the, famine, was, a, genocide, and, he, also, stated, that, no, academic, historian, continues, to, take, the, claim, of, genocide, seriously, he, argued, that, genocide, includes, murderous, intent, and, it, must, be, said, that, not, even, the, most, bigoted, and, racist, commentators, of, the, day, sought, the, extermination, of, the, irish, and, he, also, stated, that, most, people, in, whitehall, hoped, for, better, times, for, ireland, additionally, he, stated, that, the, claim, of, genocide, overlooks, the, enormous, challenge, facing, relief, agencies, both, central, and, local, public, and, private, gr, da, thinks, that, a, case, of, neglect, is, easier, to, sustain, than, a, case, of, genocide, john, leazer, professor, of, history, at, carthage, college, wisconsin, wrote, that, the, binary, framing, of, the, debate, about, the, british, government, s, and, particularly, trevelyan, s, actions, as, being, good, or, bad, is, unsatisfactory, and, that, the, entire, debate, surrounding, the, question, of, genocide, serves, to, oversimplify, and, obfuscate, complex, factors, behind, the, actions, of, the, government, as, a, whole, and, individuals, within, it, nat, hill, director, of, research, at, genocide, watch, has, stated, that, while, the, potato, famine,
