the, american, indian, wars, also, known, as, the, american, frontier, wars, and, the, indian, wars, was, a, conflict, initially, fought, by, european, colonial, empires, united, states, of, america, and, briefly, the, confederate, states, of, america, and, republic, of, texas, against, various, american, indian, tribes, in, north, america, these, conflicts, occurred, from, the, time, of, the, earliest, colonial, settlements, in, the, 17th, century, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, various, wars, resulted, from, a, wide, variety, of, factors, the, most, common, being, the, desire, of, settlers, and, governments, for, indian, tribes, lands, the, european, powers, and, their, colonies, enlisted, allied, indian, tribes, to, help, them, conduct, warfare, against, each, other, s, colonial, settlements, after, the, american, revolution, many, conflicts, were, local, to, specific, states, or, regions, and, frequently, involved, disputes, over, land, use, some, entailed, cycles, of, violent, reprisal, as, american, settlers, spread, and, expanded, westward, across, the, united, states, after, 1780, armed, conflicts, increased, in, size, duration, and, intensity, between, settlers, and, various, indian, tribes, the, climax, came, in, the, war, of, 1812, when, major, indian, coalitions, in, the, midwestern, united, states, and, the, southern, united, states, fought, against, the, united, states, and, lost, conflict, with, settlers, became, less, common, and, was, usually, resolved, by, treaties, between, the, federal, government, and, specific, tribes, which, often, required, the, tribes, to, sell, or, surrender, land, to, the, united, states, these, treaties, were, frequently, broken, by, the, federal, u, s, government, the, indian, removal, act, of, 1830, that, was, passed, by, the, united, states, congress, neither, authorized, the, unilateral, abrogation, of, treaties, guaranteeing, native, american, land, rights, within, the, states, nor, the, forced, relocation, of, the, eastern, indians, yet, both, occurred, and, on, a, massive, scale, it, forced, indian, tribes, to, move, from, east, of, the, mississippi, river, to, the, west, on, the, american, frontier, especially, to, indian, territory, which, became, oklahoma, as, settlers, expanded, onto, the, great, plains, and, the, western, united, states, the, nomadic, and, semi, nomadic, indian, tribes, of, those, regions, were, forced, to, relocate, to, indian, reservations, indian, tribes, and, coalitions, often, won, battles, with, the, encroaching, settlers, and, soldiers, but, their, numbers, were, too, few, and, their, resources, too, limited, to, win, more, than, temporary, victories, and, concessions, from, the, u, s, and, other, countries, that, colonized, areas, that, had, composed, the, modern, day, borders, of, the, united, states, of, america, the, colonization, of, north, america, by, english, spanish, french, russian, and, dutch, was, resisted, by, some, indian, tribes, and, assisted, by, other, tribes, wars, and, other, armed, conflicts, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, included, in, several, instances, the, conflicts, were, a, reflection, of, european, rivalries, with, indian, tribes, splitting, their, alliances, among, the, powers, generally, siding, with, their, trading, partners, various, tribes, fought, on, each, side, in, king, william, s, war, queen, anne, s, war, dummer, s, war, king, george, s, war, and, the, french, and, indian, war, allying, with, british, or, french, colonists, according, to, their, own, self, interests, on, 14, august, 1784, russian, colonists, had, massacred, 200, 3, 000, koniag, alutiiq, tribesmen, in, sitkalidak, island, alaska, this, massacre, is, known, as, awa, uq, massacre, despite, the, incidents, that, occurred, between, european, colonists, and, the, native, population, most, indian, tribes, were, friendly, towards, the, swedes, in, new, sweden, as, result, of, swedish, authorities, respecting, tribal, land, british, merchants, and, government, agents, began, supplying, weapons, to, indians, living, in, the, united, states, following, the, revolution, 1783, 1812, in, the, hope, that, if, a, war, broke, out, they, would, fight, on, the, british, side, the, british, further, planned, to, set, up, an, indian, nation, in, the, ohio, wisconsin, area, to, block, further, american, expansion, the, us, protested, and, declared, war, in, 1812, most, indian, tribes, supported, the, british, especially, those, allied, with, tecumseh, but, they, were, ultimately, defeated, by, general, william, henry, harrison, the, war, of, 1812, spread, to, indian, rivalries, as, well, many, refugees, from, defeated, tribes, went, over, the, border, to, canada, those, in, the, south, went, to, florida, while, it, was, under, spanish, control, as, they, would, be, considered, free, and, not, slaves, under, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, during, the, early, 19th, century, the, federal, government, was, under, pressure, by, settlers, in, many, regions, to, expel, indians, from, their, areas, the, indian, removal, act, of, 1830, stated, the, authorizing, of, the, president, to, grant, lands, west, of, the, mississippi, in, exchange, for, indian, lands, within, existing, state, borders, some, tribes, resisted, relocation, fiercely, most, notably, the, seminoles, in, a, series, of, wars, in, florida, they, were, never, defeated, although, some, seminoles, migrated, to, indian, territory, other, tribes, were, forced, to, move, to, reservations, west, of, the, mississippi, river, most, famously, the, cherokee, whose, relocation, was, called, the, trail, of, tears, the, american, revolutionary, war, was, essentially, two, parallel, wars, for, the, american, patriots, the, war, in, the, east, was, a, struggle, against, british, rule, while, the, war, in, the, west, was, an, indian, war, the, newly, proclaimed, united, states, competed, with, the, british, for, control, of, the, territory, east, of, the, mississippi, river, some, indians, sided, with, the, british, as, they, hoped, to, reduce, american, settlement, and, expansion, in, one, writer, s, opinion, the, revolutionary, war, was, the, most, extensive, and, destructive, indian, war, in, united, states, history, some, indian, tribes, were, divided, over, which, side, to, support, in, the, war, such, as, the, iroquois, confederacy, based, in, new, york, and, pennsylvania, who, split, the, oneida, and, tuscarora, sided, with, the, american, patriots, and, the, mohawk, seneca, cayuga, and, onondaga, sided, with, the, british, the, iroquois, tried, to, avoid, fighting, directly, against, one, another, but, the, revolution, eventually, forced, intra, iroquois, combat, and, both, sides, lost, territory, following, the, war, the, crown, aided, the, landless, iroquois, by, rewarding, them, with, a, reservation, at, grand, river, in, ontario, and, some, other, lands, in, the, southeast, the, cherokee, split, into, a, pro, patriot, faction, versus, a, pro, british, faction, that, the, americans, referred, to, as, the, chickamauga, cherokee, they, were, led, by, dragging, canoe, many, other, tribes, were, similarly, divided, when, the, british, made, peace, with, the, americans, in, the, 1783, treaty, of, paris, they, ceded, a, vast, amount, of, indian, territory, to, the, united, states, indian, tribes, who, had, sided, with, the, british, and, had, fought, against, the, americans, were, enemy, combatants, as, far, as, the, united, states, was, concerned, they, were, a, conquered, people, who, had, lost, their, land, the, frontier, conflicts, were, almost, non, stop, beginning, with, cherokee, involvement, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, and, continuing, through, late, 1794, the, so, called, chickamauga, cherokee, later, called, lower, cherokee, were, from, the, overhill, towns, and, later, from, the, lower, towns, valley, towns, and, middle, towns, they, followed, war, leader, dragging, canoe, southwest, first, to, the, chickamauga, creek, area, near, chattanooga, tennessee, then, to, the, five, lower, towns, where, they, were, joined, by, groups, of, muskogee, white, tories, runaway, slaves, and, renegade, chickasaw, as, well, as, by, more, than, a, hundred, shawnee, the, primary, targets, of, attack, were, the, washington, district, colonies, along, the, watauga, holston, and, nolichucky, rivers, and, in, carter, s, valley, in, upper, eastern, tennessee, as, well, as, the, settlements, along, the, cumberland, river, beginning, with, fort, nashborough, in, 1780, even, into, kentucky, plus, against, the, franklin, settlements, and, later, states, of, virginia, north, carolina, south, carolina, and, georgia, the, scope, of, attacks, by, the, chickamauga, and, their, allies, ranged, from, quick, raids, by, small, war, parties, to, large, campaigns, by, four, or, five, hundred, warriors, and, once, more, than, a, thousand, the, upper, muskogee, under, dragging, canoe, s, close, ally, alexander, mcgillivray, frequently, joined, their, campaigns, and, also, operated, separately, and, the, settlements, on, the, cumberland, came, under, attack, from, the, chickasaw, shawnee, from, the, north, and, delaware, campaigns, by, dragging, canoe, and, his, successor, john, watts, were, frequently, conducted, in, conjunction, with, campaigns, in, the, northwest, territory, the, colonists, generally, responded, with, attacks, in, which, cherokee, settlements, were, completely, destroyed, though, usually, without, great, loss, of, life, on, either, side, the, wars, continued, until, the, treaty, of, tellico, blockhouse, in, november, 1794, in, 1787, the, northwest, ordinance, officially, organized, the, northwest, territory, for, settlement, and, american, settlers, began, pouring, into, the, region, violence, erupted, as, indian, tribes, resisted, and, so, the, administration, of, president, george, washington, sent, armed, expeditions, into, the, area, however, in, the, northwest, indian, war, a, pan, tribal, confederacy, led, by, blue, jacket, shawnee, little, turtle, miami, buckongahelas, lenape, and, egushawa, ottawa, defeated, armies, led, by, generals, josiah, harmar, and, arthur, st, clair, general, st, clair, s, defeat, was, the, most, severe, loss, ever, inflicted, upon, an, american, army, by, indians, following, the, successive, defeats, the, united, states, sent, delegates, to, discuss, peace, with, the, northwestern, confederacy, but, the, two, sides, could, not, agree, on, a, boundary, line, the, united, states, dispatched, a, new, expedition, led, by, general, anthony, wayne, which, defeated, the, confederacy, at, the, 1794, battle, of, fallen, timbers, realizing, that, british, assistance, was, not, forthcoming, the, native, nations, were, compelled, to, sign, the, treaty, of, greenville, in, 1795, which, ceded, ohio, and, part, of, indiana, to, the, united, states, by, 1800, the, indian, population, was, approximately, 600, 000, in, what, would, become, the, contiguous, united, states, by, 1890, their, population, had, declined, to, about, 250, 000, in, 1800, william, henry, harrison, became, governor, of, the, indiana, territory, under, the, direction, of, president, thomas, jefferson, and, he, pursued, an, aggressive, policy, of, obtaining, titles, to, indian, lands, shawnee, brothers, tecumseh, and, tenskwatawa, organized, tecumseh, s, war, another, pan, tribal, resistance, to, westward, settlement, tecumseh, was, in, the, south, attempting, to, recruit, allies, among, the, creeks, cherokees, and, choctaws, when, harrison, marched, against, the, indian, confederacy, defeating, tenskwatawa, and, his, followers, at, the, battle, of, tippecanoe, in, 1811, the, americans, hoped, that, the, victory, would, end, the, militant, resistance, but, tecumseh, instead, chose, to, ally, openly, with, the, british, who, were, soon, at, war, with, the, americans, in, the, war, of, 1812, the, creek, war, 1813, 14, began, as, a, tribal, conflict, within, the, creek, tribe, but, it, became, part, of, the, larger, struggle, against, american, expansion, tecumseh, was, killed, by, harrison, s, army, at, the, battle, of, the, thames, ending, the, resistance, in, the, old, northwest, the, first, seminole, war, in, 1818, resulted, in, the, transfer, of, florida, from, spain, to, the, united, states, in, 1819, american, settlers, began, to, push, into, florida, which, was, now, an, american, territory, and, had, some, of, the, most, fertile, lands, in, the, nation, paul, hoffman, claims, that, covetousness, racism, and, self, defense, against, indian, raids, played, a, major, part, in, the, settlers, determination, to, rid, florida, of, indians, once, and, for, all, to, compound, the, tension, runaway, black, slaves, sometimes, found, refuge, in, seminole, camps, the, result, was, clashes, between, white, settlers, and, the, indians, residing, there, andrew, jackson, sought, to, alleviate, this, problem, by, signing, the, indian, removal, act, in, 1830, which, stipulated, the, relocation, of, indians, out, of, florida, by, force, if, necessary, many, seminole, groups, were, relatively, new, arrivals, in, florida, led, by, such, powerful, leaders, as, aripeka, sam, jones, micanopy, and, osceola, and, they, had, no, intention, of, leaving, their, lands, they, retaliated, against, the, settlers, and, this, led, to, the, second, seminole, war, the, longest, and, most, costly, war, that, the, army, ever, waged, against, indians, in, may, 1830, the, indian, removal, act, was, passed, by, congress, which, stipulated, forced, removal, of, indians, to, oklahoma, the, treaty, of, paynes, landing, was, signed, in, may, 1832, by, a, few, seminole, chiefs, who, later, recanted, claiming, that, they, were, tricked, or, forced, to, sign, and, making, it, clear, that, they, would, not, consent, to, relocating, to, a, reservation, out, west, the, seminoles, continued, resistance, to, relocation, led, florida, to, prepare, for, war, the, st, augustine, militia, asked, the, us, war, department, for, the, loan, of, 500, muskets, and, 500, volunteers, were, mobilized, under, brig, gen, richard, k, call, indian, war, parties, raided, farms, and, settlements, and, families, fled, to, forts, or, large, towns, or, out, of, the, territory, altogether, a, war, party, led, by, osceola, captured, a, florida, militia, supply, train, killing, eight, of, its, guards, and, wounding, six, others, most, of, the, goods, taken, were, recovered, by, the, militia, in, another, fight, a, few, days, later, sugar, plantations, were, destroyed, along, the, atlantic, coast, south, of, st, augustine, florida, with, many, of, the, slaves, on, the, plantations, joining, the, seminoles, the, us, army, had, 11, companies, about, 550, soldiers, stationed, in, florida, fort, king, ocala, had, only, one, company, of, soldiers, and, it, was, feared, that, they, might, be, overrun, by, the, seminoles, three, companies, were, stationed, at, fort, brooke, tampa, with, another, two, expected, imminently, so, the, army, decided, to, send, two, companies, to, fort, king, on, december, 23, 1835, the, two, companies, totaling, 110, men, left, fort, brooke, under, the, command, of, major, francis, l, dade, seminoles, shadowed, the, marching, soldiers, for, five, days, and, they, ambushed, them, and, wiped, out, the, command, on, december, 28, only, three, men, survived, and, one, was, hunted, down, and, killed, by, a, seminole, the, next, day, survivors, ransome, clarke, and, joseph, sprague, returned, to, fort, brooke, clarke, died, of, his, wounds, later, and, he, provided, the, only, account, of, the, battle, from, the, army, s, perspective, the, seminoles, lost, three, men, and, five, wounded, on, the, same, day, as, the, massacre, osceola, and, his, followers, shot, and, killed, agent, wiley, thompson, and, six, others, during, an, ambush, outside, of, fort, king, on, december, 29, general, clinch, left, fort, drane, with, 750, soldiers, including, 500, volunteers, on, an, enlistment, due, to, end, january, 1, 1836, the, group, was, traveling, to, a, seminole, stronghold, called, the, cove, of, the, withlacoochee, an, area, of, many, lakes, on, the, southwest, side, of, the, withlacoochee, river, when, they, reached, the, river, the, soldiers, could, not, find, the, ford, so, clinch, ferried, his, regular, troops, across, the, river, in, a, single, canoe, once, they, were, across, and, had, relaxed, the, seminoles, attacked, the, troops, fixed, bayonets, and, charged, them, at, the, cost, of, four, dead, and, 59, wounded, the, militia, provided, cover, as, the, army, troops, then, withdrew, across, the, river, in, the, battle, of, lake, okeechobee, colonel, zachary, taylor, saw, the, first, major, action, of, the, campaign, he, left, fort, gardiner, on, the, upper, kissimmee, river, with, 1, 000, men, on, december, 19, and, headed, towards, lake, okeechobee, in, the, first, two, days, 90, seminoles, surrendered, on, the, third, day, taylor, stopped, to, build, fort, basinger, where, he, left, his, sick, and, enough, men, to, guard, the, seminoles, who, had, surrendered, taylor, s, column, caught, up, with, the, main, body, of, the, seminoles, on, the, north, shore, of, lake, okeechobee, on, december, 25, the, seminoles, were, led, by, alligator, sam, jones, and, the, recently, escaped, coacoochee, and, they, were, positioned, in, a, hammock, surrounded, by, sawgrass, the, ground, was, thick, mud, and, sawgrass, easily, cuts, and, burns, the, skin, taylor, had, about, 800, men, while, the, seminoles, numbered, fewer, than, 400, taylor, sent, in, the, missouri, volunteers, first, moving, his, troops, squarely, into, the, center, of, the, swamp, his, plan, was, to, make, a, direct, attack, rather, than, encircle, the, indians, all, his, men, were, on, foot, as, soon, as, they, came, within, range, the, indians, opened, with, heavy, fire, the, volunteers, broke, and, their, commander, colonel, gentry, was, fatally, wounded, so, they, retreated, back, across, the, swamp, the, fighting, in, the, sawgrass, was, deadliest, for, five, companies, of, the, sixth, infantry, every, officer, but, one, was, killed, or, wounded, along, with, most, of, their, non, commissioned, officers, the, soldiers, suffered, 26, killed, and, 112, wounded, compared, to, 11, seminoles, killed, and, 14, wounded, no, seminoles, were, captured, although, taylor, did, capture, 100, ponies, and, 600, head, of, cattle, by, 1842, the, war, was, winding, down, and, most, seminoles, had, left, florida, for, oklahoma, the, us, army, officially, recorded, 1, 466, deaths, in, the, second, seminole, war, mostly, from, disease, the, number, killed, in, action, is, less, clear, mahon, reports, 328, regular, army, killed, in, action, while, missall, reports, that, seminoles, killed, 269, officers, and, men, almost, half, of, those, deaths, occurred, in, the, dade, massacre, battle, of, lake, okeechobee, and, harney, massacre, similarly, mahon, reports, 69, deaths, for, the, navy, while, missal, reports, 41, for, the, navy, and, marine, corps, mahon, and, the, florida, board, of, state, institutions, agree, that, 55, volunteer, officers, and, men, were, killed, by, the, seminoles, while, missall, says, that, the, number, is, unknown, a, northern, newspaper, carried, a, report, that, more, than, 80, civilians, were, killed, by, indians, in, florida, in, 1839, by, the, end, of, 1843, 3, 824, indians, had, been, shipped, from, florida, to, the, indian, territory, the, series, of, conflicts, in, the, western, united, states, between, indians, american, settlers, and, the, united, states, army, are, generally, known, as, the, indian, wars, many, of, these, conflicts, occurred, during, and, after, the, civil, war, until, the, closing, of, the, frontier, in, about, 1890, however, regions, of, the, west, that, were, settled, before, the, civil, war, saw, significant, conflicts, prior, to, 1860, such, as, texas, new, mexico, utah, oregon, california, and, washington, state, various, statistics, have, been, developed, concerning, the, devastation, of, these, wars, on, the, peoples, involved, gregory, michno, used, records, dealing, with, figures, as, a, direct, result, of, engagements, and, concluded, that, of, the, 21, 586, total, casualties, tabulated, in, this, survey, military, personnel, and, civilians, accounted, for, 6, 596, 31, while, indian, casualties, totaled, about, 14, 990, 69, for, the, period, of, 1850, 90, however, michno, says, that, he, used, the, army, s, estimates, in, almost, every, case, and, the, number, of, casualties, in, this, study, are, inherently, biased, toward, army, estimations, his, work, includes, almost, nothing, on, indian, war, parties, and, he, states, that, army, records, are, often, incomplete, according, to, michno, more, conflicts, with, indians, occurred, in, the, states, bordering, mexico, than, in, the, interior, states, arizona, ranked, highest, with, 310, known, battles, fought, within, the, state, s, boundaries, between, americans, and, indians, also, arizona, ranked, highest, of, the, states, in, deaths, from, the, wars, at, least, 4, 340, people, were, killed, including, both, the, settlers, and, the, indians, over, twice, as, many, as, occurred, in, texas, the, second, highest, ranking, state, most, of, the, deaths, in, arizona, were, caused, by, the, apaches, michno, also, says, that, 51, percent, of, the, battles, took, place, in, arizona, texas, and, new, mexico, between, 1850, and, 1890, as, well, as, 37, percent, of, the, casualties, in, the, country, west, of, the, mississippi, river, american, settlers, and, fur, trappers, had, spread, into, the, western, united, states, territories, and, had, established, the, santa, fe, trail, and, the, oregon, trail, relations, were, generally, peaceful, between, american, settlers, and, indians, the, bents, of, bent, s, fort, on, the, santa, fe, trail, had, friendly, relations, with, the, cheyenne, and, arapaho, and, peace, was, established, on, the, oregon, trail, by, the, treaty, of, fort, laramie, signed, in, 1851, between, the, united, states, and, the, plains, indians, and, the, indians, of, the, northern, rocky, mountains, the, treaty, allowed, passage, by, settlers, building, roads, and, stationing, troops, along, the, oregon, trail, the, pike, s, peak, gold, rush, of, 1859, introduced, a, substantial, white, population, into, the, front, range, of, the, rockies, supported, by, a, trading, lifeline, that, crossed, the, central, great, plains, advancing, settlement, following, the, passage, of, the, homestead, act, of, 1862, and, the, growing, transcontinental, railways, following, the, civil, war, further, destabilized, the, situation, placing, white, settlers, into, direct, competition, for, the, land, and, resources, of, the, great, plains, and, the, rocky, mountain, west, additional, factors, included, discovery, of, gold, in, montana, during, the, montana, gold, rush, of, 1862, 1863, and, the, opening, of, the, bozeman, trail, which, led, to, red, cloud, s, war, and, later, discovery, of, gold, in, the, black, hills, resulting, in, the, gold, rush, of, 1875, 1878, and, the, great, sioux, war, of, 1876, 77, miners, ranchers, and, settlers, expanded, into, the, plain, and, this, led, to, increasing, conflicts, with, the, indian, populations, of, the, west, many, tribes, fought, american, settlers, at, one, time, or, another, from, the, utes, of, the, great, basin, to, the, nez, perce, tribe, of, idaho, but, the, sioux, of, the, northern, plains, and, the, apaches, of, the, southwest, waged, the, most, aggressive, warfare, led, by, resolute, militant, leaders, such, as, red, cloud, and, crazy, horse, the, sioux, were, relatively, new, arrivals, on, the, plains, as, they, had, been, sedentary, farmers, in, the, great, lakes, region, previously, they, moved, west, displacing, other, indian, tribes, and, becoming, feared, warriors, the, apaches, supplemented, their, economy, by, raiding, other, tribes, and, they, practiced, warfare, to, avenge, the, death, of, a, kinsman, during, the, american, civil, war, army, units, were, withdrawn, to, fight, the, war, in, the, east, they, were, replaced, by, the, volunteer, infantry, and, cavalry, raised, by, the, states, of, california, and, oregon, by, the, western, territorial, governments, or, by, the, local, militias, these, units, fought, the, indians, and, kept, open, communications, with, the, east, holding, the, west, for, the, union, and, defeating, the, confederate, attempt, to, capture, the, new, mexico, territory, after, 1865, national, policy, called, for, all, indians, either, to, assimilate, into, the, american, population, as, citizens, or, to, live, peacefully, on, reservations, raids, and, wars, between, tribes, were, not, allowed, and, armed,

warfare, between, the, comanches, in, the, north, and, west, of, the, state, and, spanish, settlements, in, the, south, and, east, in, the, battle, of, the, twin, villages, in, 1759, the, comanche, and, their, wichita, allies, defeated, a, spanish, and, apache, army, of, more, than, 500, men, and, halted, spanish, expansion, in, texas, comanche, raids, on, spanish, settlements, and, their, lipan, apache, allies, in, texas, and, a, defensive, spanish, posture, characterized, the, next, 70, years, in, the, 1830s, large, numbers, of, americans, began, to, settle, in, texas, and, they, encroached, on, comancheria, the, proto, empire, of, the, comanches, a, series, of, battles, between, americans, and, comanches, and, their, kiowa, and, kiowa, apache, allies, continued, until, the, 1870s, the, first, notable, battle, between, american, settlers, and, comanche, was, the, fort, parker, massacre, in, 1836, in, which, a, war, party, of, comanches, kiowas, wichitas, and, delawares, attacked, the, texan, outpost, at, fort, parker, a, small, number, of, settlers, were, killed, during, the, raid, and, the, abduction, of, cynthia, ann, parker, and, two, other, children, caused, widespread, outrage, among, texans, the, republic, of, texas, gained, independence, from, mexico, in, 1836, the, texas, government, under, president, sam, houston, pursued, a, policy, of, engagement, with, the, comanches, and, kiowas, houston, had, lived, with, the, cherokees, but, the, cherokees, joined, with, mexican, forces, to, fight, against, texas, houston, resolved, the, conflict, without, resorting, to, arms, refusing, to, believe, that, the, cherokees, would, take, up, arms, against, his, government, the, administration, of, mirabeau, b, lamar, followed, houston, s, and, took, a, very, different, policy, towards, the, indians, lamar, removed, the, cherokees, to, the, west, and, then, sought, to, deport, the, comanches, and, kiowas, this, led, to, a, series, of, battles, including, the, council, house, fight, in, which, the, texas, militia, killed, 33, comanche, chiefs, at, a, peace, parley, the, comanches, retaliated, with, the, great, raid, of, 1840, and, the, battle, of, plum, creek, followed, several, days, later, the, lamar, administration, was, known, for, its, failed, and, expensive, indian, policy, the, cost, of, the, war, with, the, indians, exceeded, the, annual, revenue, of, the, government, throughout, his, four, year, term, it, was, followed, by, a, second, houston, administration, which, resumed, the, previous, policy, of, diplomacy, texas, signed, treaties, with, all, of, the, tribes, including, the, comanches, in, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, the, comanches, and, their, allies, shifted, most, of, their, raiding, to, a, weak, and, newly, independent, mexico, comanche, armies, numbering, in, the, hundreds, raided, deep, into, mexico, for, horses, and, captives, and, used, texas, as, a, safe, haven, from, mexican, retaliation, see, comanche, mexico, wars, texas, joined, the, union, in, 1845, and, the, federal, government, and, texas, took, up, the, struggle, between, the, plains, indians, and, the, settlers, the, conflicts, were, particularly, vicious, and, bloody, on, the, texas, frontier, in, 1856, through, 1858, as, settlers, continued, to, expand, their, settlements, into, comancheria, the, first, texan, incursion, into, the, heart, of, the, comancheria, was, in, 1858, the, so, called, antelope, hills, expedition, marked, by, the, battle, of, little, robe, creek, the, battles, between, settlers, and, indians, continued, in, 1860, and, texas, militia, destroyed, an, indian, camp, at, the, battle, of, pease, river, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, the, texans, learned, that, they, had, recaptured, cynthia, ann, parker, the, little, girl, captured, by, the, comanches, in, 1836, she, returned, to, live, with, her, family, but, she, missed, her, children, including, her, son, quanah, parker, he, was, the, son, of, parker, and, comanche, chief, peta, nocona, and, he, became, a, comanche, war, chief, at, the, second, battle, of, adobe, walls, he, ultimately, surrendered, to, the, overwhelming, force, of, the, federal, government, and, moved, to, a, reservation, in, southwestern, oklahoma, in, 1875, on, 1, 4, october, 1804, russian, america, now, the, state, of, alaska, had, suppressed, a, revolt, by, the, tlingit, kiks, di, clan, during, the, battle, of, sitka, a, number, of, wars, occurred, in, the, wake, of, the, oregon, treaty, of, 1846, and, the, creation, of, oregon, territory, and, washington, territory, among, the, causes, of, conflict, were, a, sudden, immigration, to, the, region, and, a, series, of, gold, rushes, throughout, the, pacific, northwest, the, whitman, massacre, of, 1847, triggered, the, cayuse, war, which, led, to, fighting, from, the, cascade, range, to, the, rocky, mountains, the, cayuse, were, defeated, in, 1855, but, the, conflict, had, expanded, and, continued, in, what, became, known, as, the, yakima, war, 1855, 1858, washington, territory, governor, isaac, stevens, tried, to, compel, indian, tribes, to, sign, treaties, ceding, land, and, establishing, reservations, the, yakama, signed, one, of, the, treaties, negotiated, during, the, walla, walla, council, of, 1855, establishing, the, yakama, indian, reservation, but, stevens, attempts, served, mainly, to, intensify, hostilities, gold, discoveries, near, fort, colville, resulted, in, many, miners, crossing, yakama, lands, via, naches, pass, and, conflicts, rapidly, escalated, into, violence, it, took, several, years, for, the, army, to, defeat, the, yakama, during, which, time, war, spread, to, the, puget, sound, region, west, of, the, cascades, the, puget, sound, war, of, 1855, 1856, was, triggered, in, part, by, the, yakima, war, and, in, part, by, the, use, of, intimidation, to, compel, tribes, to, sign, land, cession, treaties, the, treaty, of, medicine, creek, of, 1855, established, an, unrealistically, small, reservation, on, poor, land, for, the, nisqually, and, puyallup, tribes, violence, broke, out, in, the, white, river, valley, along, the, route, to, naches, pass, and, connecting, nisqually, and, yakama, lands, the, puget, sound, war, is, often, remembered, in, connection, with, the, battle, of, seattle, 1856, and, the, execution, of, nisqually, chief, leschi, a, central, figure, of, the, war, in, 1858, the, fighting, spread, on, the, east, side, of, the, cascades, this, second, phase, of, the, yakima, war, is, known, as, the, coeur, d, alene, war, the, yakama, palouse, spokane, and, coeur, d, alene, tribes, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, four, lakes, in, late, 1858, in, southwest, oregon, tensions, and, skirmishes, escalated, between, american, settlers, and, the, rogue, river, peoples, into, the, rogue, river, wars, of, 1855, 1856, the, california, gold, rush, helped, fuel, a, large, increase, in, the, number, of, people, traveling, south, through, the, rogue, river, valley, gold, discoveries, continued, to, trigger, violent, conflict, between, prospectors, and, indians, beginning, in, 1858, the, fraser, canyon, gold, rush, in, british, columbia, drew, large, numbers, of, miners, many, from, washington, oregon, and, california, culminating, in, the, fraser, canyon, war, this, conflict, occurred, in, the, colony, of, british, columbia, but, the, militias, involved, were, formed, mostly, of, americans, shortly, after, the, fraser, canyon, war, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, pacific, northwest, coast, including, areas, that, are, now, part, of, the, united, states, and, canada, from, washington, to, alaska, suffered, major, population, loss, cultural, devastation, and, loss, of, sovereignty, due, to, the, 1862, pacific, northwest, smallpox, epidemic, the, chilcotin, war, of, 1864, occurred, near, the, end, of, the, epidemic, when, a, road, from, the, gold, fields, to, the, coast, was, being, built, through, tsilhqot, in, chilcotin, territory, without, permission, at, the, time, and, still, today, first, nations, such, as, the, tsilhqot, in, say, the, colonial, government, deliberately, spread, smallpox, with, the, aim, of, ending, indigenous, sovereignty, and, indigenous, rights, in, british, columbia, workers, on, the, road, building, project, threatened, the, tsilhqot, in, with, smallpox, the, war, ended, with, the, hanging, of, six, tsilhqot, in, chiefs, in, 2014, british, columbia, premier, christy, clark, formally, exonerated, the, executed, chiefs, and, apologized, for, these, acts, acknowledging, that, there, is, an, indication, was, spread, intentionally, the, discovery, of, gold, in, idaho, and, oregon, in, the, 1860s, led, to, similar, conflicts, which, culminated, in, the, bear, river, massacre, in, 1863, and, snake, war, from, 1864, to, 1868, in, the, late, 1870s, another, series, of, armed, conflicts, occurred, in, oregon, and, idaho, spreading, east, into, wyoming, and, montana, the, nez, perce, war, of, 1877, is, known, particularly, for, chief, joseph, and, the, four, month, 1, 200, mile, fighting, retreat, of, a, band, of, about, 800, nez, perce, including, women, and, children, the, nez, perce, war, was, caused, by, a, large, influx, of, settlers, the, appropriation, of, indian, lands, and, a, gold, rush, this, time, in, idaho, the, nez, perce, engaged, 2, 000, american, soldiers, of, different, military, units, as, well, as, their, indian, auxiliaries, they, fought, eighteen, engagements, including, four, major, battles, and, at, least, four, fiercely, contested, skirmishes, according, to, alvin, josephy, chief, joseph, and, the, nez, perce, were, much, admired, for, their, conduct, in, the, war, and, their, fighting, ability, the, bannock, war, broke, out, the, following, year, for, similar, reasons, the, sheepeater, indian, war, in, 1879, was, the, last, conflict, in, the, area, various, wars, between, spanish, and, native, americans, mainly, comanches, and, apaches, took, place, from, the, 17th, to, the, 19th, century, in, the, southwest, united, states, spanish, governors, made, peace, treaties, with, some, tribes, during, this, period, several, events, stand, out, during, the, colonial, period, on, the, one, hand, the, administration, of, tom, s, v, lez, cachup, n, the, only, colonial, governor, of, new, mexico, who, managed, to, establish, peace, with, the, comanches, after, having, confronted, them, in, the, battle, of, san, diego, pond, and, learned, how, to, relate, to, them, without, giving, rise, to, misunderstandings, that, could, lead, to, conflict, with, them, the, pueblo, revolt, of, 1680, was, also, highlighted, causing, the, spanish, province, to, be, divided, into, two, areas, one, led, by, the, spanish, governor, and, the, other, by, the, leader, of, the, pueblos, several, military, conflicts, happened, between, spaniards, and, pueblos, in, this, period, until, diego, de, vargas, made, a, peace, treaty, with, them, in, 1691, which, made, them, subjects, of, the, spanish, governor, again, conflicts, between, europeans, and, indigenous, peoples, continued, following, the, acquisition, of, alta, california, and, santa, fe, de, nuevo, m, xico, from, mexico, at, the, end, of, the, mexican, american, war, in, 1848, and, the, gadsden, purchase, in, 1853, these, spanned, from, 1846, to, at, least, 1895, the, first, conflicts, were, in, the, new, mexico, territory, and, later, in, california, and, the, utah, territory, during, and, after, the, california, gold, rush, indian, tribes, in, the, southwest, had, been, engaged, in, cycles, of, trading, and, fighting, with, one, another, and, with, settlers, for, centuries, prior, to, the, united, states, gaining, control, of, the, region, these, conflicts, with, the, united, states, involved, every, non, pueblo, tribe, in, the, region, and, often, were, a, continuation, of, mexican, spanish, conflicts, the, navajo, wars, and, apache, wars, are, perhaps, the, best, known, the, last, major, campaign, of, the, military, against, indians, in, the, southwest, involved, 5, 000, troops, in, the, field, and, resulted, in, the, surrender, of, chiricahua, apache, geronimo, and, his, band, of, 24, warriors, women, and, children, in, 1886, the, u, s, army, kept, a, small, garrison, west, of, the, rockies, but, starting, in, 1849, the, california, gold, rush, brought, a, great, influx, of, miners, and, settlers, into, the, area, the, result, was, that, most, of, the, early, conflicts, with, the, california, indians, involved, local, parties, of, miners, or, settlers, during, the, american, civil, war, california, volunteers, replaced, federal, troops, and, won, the, ongoing, bald, hills, war, and, the, owens, valley, indian, war, and, engaged, in, minor, actions, in, northern, california, california, and, oregon, volunteer, garrisons, in, nevada, oregon, idaho, utah, new, mexico, and, the, arizona, territories, also, engaged, in, conflicts, with, the, apache, cheyenne, goshute, navajo, paiute, shoshone, sioux, and, ute, indians, from, 1862, to, 1866, following, the, civil, war, california, was, mostly, pacified, but, federal, troops, replaced, the, volunteers, and, again, took, up, the, struggle, against, indians, in, the, remote, regions, of, the, mojave, desert, and, in, the, northeast, during, the, snake, war, 1864, 1868, and, modoc, war, 1872, 1873, the, tribes, of, the, great, basin, were, mostly, shoshone, and, they, were, greatly, affected, by, the, oregon, and, california, trails, and, by, mormon, pioneers, to, utah, the, shoshone, had, friendly, relations, with, american, and, british, fur, traders, and, trappers, beginning, with, their, encounter, with, lewis, and, clark, the, traditional, way, of, life, of, the, indians, was, disrupted, and, they, began, raiding, travelers, along, the, trails, and, aggression, toward, mormon, settlers, during, the, american, civil, war, the, california, volunteers, stationed, in, utah, responded, to, complaints, which, resulted, in, the, bear, river, massacre, following, the, massacre, various, shoshone, tribes, signed, a, series, of, treaties, exchanging, promises, of, peace, for, small, annuities, and, reservations, one, of, these, was, the, box, elder, treaty, which, identified, a, land, claim, made, by, the, northwestern, shoshone, the, supreme, court, declared, this, claim, to, be, non, binding, in, a, 1945, ruling, but, the, indian, claims, commission, recognized, it, as, binding, in, 1968, descendants, of, the, original, group, were, compensated, collectively, at, a, rate, of, less, than, 0, 50, per, acre, minus, legal, fees, most, of, the, local, groups, were, decimated, by, the, war, and, faced, continuing, loss, of, hunting, and, fishing, land, caused, by, the, steadily, growing, population, some, moved, to, the, fort, hall, indian, reservation, when, it, was, created, in, 1868, some, of, the, shoshone, populated, the, mormon, sanctioned, community, of, washakie, utah, from, 1864, california, and, oregon, volunteers, also, engaged, in, the, early, campaigns, of, the, snake, war, in, the, great, basin, areas, of, california, nevada, oregon, and, idaho, from, 1866, the, u, s, army, replaced, the, volunteers, in, that, war, which, general, george, crook, brought, to, an, end, in, 1868, after, a, protracted, campaign, initially, relations, between, participants, in, the, pike, s, peak, gold, rush, and, the, native, american, tribes, of, the, front, range, and, the, platte, valley, were, friendly, an, attempt, was, made, to, resolve, conflicts, by, negotiation, of, the, treaty, of, fort, wise, which, established, a, reservation, in, southeastern, colorado, but, the, settlement, was, not, agreed, to, by, all, of, the, roving, warriors, particularly, the, dog, soldiers, during, the, early, 1860s, tensions, increased, and, culminated, in, the, colorado, war, and, the, sand, creek, massacre, where, colorado, volunteers, fell, on, a, peaceful, cheyenne, village, killing, women, and, children, which, set, the, stage, for, further, conflict, the, peaceful, relationship, between, settlers, and, the, indians, of, the, colorado, and, kansas, plains, was, maintained, faithfully, by, the, tribes, but, sentiment, grew, among, the, colorado, settlers, for, indian, removal, the, savagery, of, the, attacks, on, civilians, during, the, dakota, war, of, 1862, contributed, to, these, sentiments, as, did, the, few, minor, incidents, which, occurred, in, the, platte, valley, and, in, areas, east, of, denver, regular, army, troops, had, been, withdrawn, for, service, in, the, civil, war, and, were, replaced, with, the, colorado, volunteers, rough, men, who, often, favored, extermination, of, the, indians, they, were, commanded, by, john, chivington, and, george, l, shoup, who, followed, the, lead, of, john, evans, territorial, governor, of, colorado, they, adopted, a, policy, of, shooting, on, sight, all, indians, encountered, a, policy, which, in, short, time, ignited, a, general, war, on, the, colorado, and, kansas, plains, the, colorado, war, raids, by, bands, of, plains, indians, on, isolated, homesteads, to, the, east, of, denver, on, the, advancing, settlements, in, kansas, and, on, stage, line, stations, along, the, south, platte, such, as, at, julesburg, and, along, the, smoky, hill, trail, resulted, in, settlers, in, both, colorado, and, kansas, adopting, a, murderous, attitude, towards, native, americans, with, calls, for, extermination, likewise, the, savagery, shown, by, the, colorado, volunteers, during, the, sand, creek, massacre, resulted, in, native, americans, particularly, the, dog, soldiers, a, band, of, the, cheyenne, engaging, in, savage, retribution, the, dakota, war, of, 1862, more, commonly, called, the, sioux, uprising, of, 1862, in, older, authorities, and, popular, texts, was, the, first, major, armed, engagement, between, the, u, s, and, the, sioux, dakota, after, six, weeks, of, fighting, in, minnesota, led, mostly, by, chief, taoyateduta, aka, little, crow, records, conclusively, show, that, more, than, 500, u, s, soldiers, and, settlers, died, in, the, conflict, though, many, more, may, have, died, in, small, raids, or, after, being, captured, the, number, of, sioux, dead, in, the, uprising, is, mostly, undocumented, after, the, war, 303, sioux, warriors, were, convicted, of, murder, and, rape, by, u, s, military, tribunals, and, sentenced, to, death, most, of, the, death, sentences, were, commuted, by, president, lincoln, but, on, december, 26, 1862, in, mankato, minnesota, 38, dakota, sioux, men, were, hanged, in, what, is, still, today, the, largest, penal, mass, execution, in, u, s, history, after, the, expulsion, of, the, dakota, some, refugees, and, warriors, made, their, way, to, lakota, lands, in, what, is, now, north, dakota, battles, continued, between, minnesota, regiments, and, combined, lakota, and, dakota, forces, through, 1864, as, colonel, henry, sibley, pursued, the, sioux, into, dakota, territory, sibley, s, army, defeated, the, lakota, and, dakota, in, three, major, battles, in, 1863, the, battle, of, dead, buffalo, lake, on, july, 26, 1863, the, battle, of, stony, lake, on, july, 28, 1863, and, the, battle, of, whitestone, hill, on, september, 3, 1863, the, sioux, retreated, further, but, again, faced, an, american, army, in, 1864, this, time, gen, alfred, sully, led, a, force, from, near, fort, pierre, south, dakota, and, decisively, defeated, the, sioux, at, the, battle, of, killdeer, mountain, on, july, 28, 1864, on, november, 29, 1864, the, colorado, territory, militia, responded, to, a, series, of, indian, attacks, on, white, settlements, by, attacking, a, cheyenne, and, arapaho, encampment, on, sand, creek, in, southeastern, colorado, under, orders, to, take, no, prisoners, the, militia, killed, about, 200, of, the, indians, two, thirds, of, whom, were, women, and, children, taking, scalps, and, other, grisly, trophies, following, the, massacre, the, survivors, joined, the, camps, of, the, cheyenne, on, the, smokey, hill, and, republican, rivers, they, smoked, the, war, pipe, and, passed, it, from, camp, to, camp, among, the, sioux, cheyenne, and, arapaho, camped, in, the, area, and, they, planned, an, attack, on, the, stage, station, and, fort, at, julesburg, which, they, carried, out, in, the, january, 1865, battle, of, julesburg, this, attack, was, followed, up, by, numerous, raids, along, the, south, platte, both, east, and, west, of, julesburg, and, by, a, second, raid, on, julesburg, in, early, february, the, bulk, of, the, indians, then, moved, north, into, nebraska, on, their, way, to, the, black, hills, and, the, powder, river, in, the, spring, of, 1865, raids, continued, along, the, oregon, trail, in, nebraska, indians, raided, the, oregon, trail, along, the, north, platte, river, and, attacked, the, troops, stationed, at, the, bridge, across, the, north, platte, at, casper, wyoming, in, the, battle, of, platte, bridge, after, the, civil, war, all, of, the, indians, were, assigned, to, reservations, and, the, reservations, were, under, the, control, of, the, interior, department, control, of, the, great, plains, fell, under, the, army, s, department, of, the, missouri, an, administrative, area, of, over, 1, 000, 000, mi, 2, encompassing, all, land, between, the, mississippi, river, and, the, rocky, mountains, maj, gen, winfield, s, hancock, had, led, the, department, in, 1866, but, had, mishandled, his, campaign, resulting, in, sioux, and, cheyenne, raids, that, attacked, mail, stagecoaches, burned, the, stations, and, killed, the, employees, they, also, raped, killed, and, kidnapped, settlers, on, the, frontier, philip, sheridan, was, the, military, governor, of, louisiana, and, texas, in, 1866, but, president, johnson, removed, him, from, that, post, claiming, that, he, was, ruling, over, the, area, with, absolute, tyranny, and, insubordination, shortly, after, hancock, was, removed, as, head, of, the, department, of, the, missouri, and, sheridan, replaced, him, in, august, 1867, he, was, ordered, to, pacify, the, plains, and, take, control, of, the, indians, there, and, he, immediately, called, general, custer, back, to, command, of, the, 7th, cavalry, hancock, had, suspended, him, the, department, of, missouri, was, in, poor, shape, upon, sheridan, s, arrival, commissioners, from, the, government, had, signed, a, peace, treaty, in, october, 1867, with, the, comanche, kiowa, kiowa, apache, cheyenne, and, arapaho, which, offered, them, reservation, land, to, live, on, along, with, food, and, supplies, but, congress, failed, to, pass, it, the, promised, supplies, from, the, government, were, not, reaching, the, indians, and, they, were, beginning, to, starve, numbering, an, estimated, 6, 000, sheridan, had, only, 2, 600, men, at, the, time, to, control, them, and, to, defend, against, any, raids, or, attacks, and, only, 1, 200, of, his, men, were, mounted, these, men, were, also, under, supplied, and, stationed, at, forts, that, were, in, poor, condition, they, were, also, mostly, unproven, units, that, replaced, retired, veterans, from, the, civil, war, sheridan, attempted, to, improve, the, conditions, of, the, military, outpost, and, the, indians, on, the, plains, through, a, peace, oriented, strategy, toward, the, beginning, of, his, command, members, of, the, cheyenne, and, arapaho, followed, him, on, his, travels, from, fort, larned, to, fort, dodge, where, he, spoke, to, them, they, brought, their, problems, to, him, and, explained, how, the, promised, supplies, were, not, being, delivered, in, response, sheridan, gave, them, a, supply, of, rations, shortly, after, the, saline, valley, settlements, were, attacked, by, indians, and, that, was, followed, by, other, violent, raids, and, kidnappings, in, the, region, sheridan, wanted, to, respond, in, force, but, was, constrained, by, the, government, s, peace, policy, and, the, lack, of, well, supplied, mounted, troops, he, could, not, deploy, official, military, units, so, he, commissioned, a, group, of, 47, frontiersmen, and, sharpshooters, called, solomon, s, avengers, they, investigated, the, raids, near,
