common, people, zhou, enlai, pointed, out, that, the, 1911, revolution, overthrew, the, qing, rule, ended, 4, 000, years, of, monarchy, and, liberated, the, mind, of, people, to, a, great, extent, and, opened, up, the, path, for, the, development, of, future, revolution, this, is, a, great, victory, a, change, in, the, belief, that, the, revolution, had, been, a, generally, positive, change, began, in, the, late, 1980s, and, 1990s, but, zhang, shizhao, was, quoted, as, arguing, that, when, talking, about, the, 1911, revolution, the, theorist, these, days, tends, to, overemphasize, the, word, success, was, way, overused, the, degree, of, success, of, democracy, gained, by, the, revolution, can, vary, depending, on, one, s, view, even, after, sun, yat, sen, died, in, 1925, for, sixty, years, the, kmt, controlled, all, five, branches, of, the, government, none, were, independent, yan, jiaqi, founder, of, the, federation, for, a, democratic, china, has, said, that, sun, yat, sen, is,
