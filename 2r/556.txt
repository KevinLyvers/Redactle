an, isolated, event, numerous, failed, attempts, at, regaining, independence, took, place, throughout, the, ottoman, era, throughout, the, 17th, century, there, was, great, resistance, to, the, ottomans, in, the, morea, and, elsewhere, as, evidenced, by, revolts, led, by, dionysius, the, philosopher, after, the, morean, war, the, peloponnese, came, under, venetian, rule, for, 30, years, and, remained, in, turmoil, from, then, on, and, throughout, the, 17th, century, as, bands, of, klephts, multiplied, the, first, great, uprising, was, the, russian, sponsored, orlov, revolt, of, the, 1770s, which, was, crushed, by, the, ottomans, after, having, limited, success, after, the, suppression, of, the, uprising, muslim, albanians, ravaged, many, regions, of, mainland, greece, however, the, maniots, continually, resisted, ottoman, rule, and, defeated, several, ottoman, incursions, into, their, region, the, most, famous, of, which, was, the, invasion, of, 1770, during, the, second, russo, turkish, war, the, greek, community, of, trieste, financed, a, small, fleet, under, lambros, katsonis, which, was, a, nuisance, for, the, ottoman, navy, during, the, war, klephts, and, armatoloi, guerilla, fighters, in, mountainous, areas, rose, once, again, at, the, same, time, a, number, of, greeks, enjoyed, a, privileged, position, in, the, ottoman, state, as, members, of, the, ottoman, bureaucracy, greeks, controlled, the, affairs, of, the, orthodox, church, through, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, of, constantinople, as, the, higher, clergy, of, the, orthodox, church, was, mostly, of, greek, origin, thus, as, a, result, of, the, ottoman, millet, system, the, predominantly, greek, hierarchy, of, the, patriarchate, enjoyed, control, over, the, empire, s, orthodox, subjects, the, rum, milleti, the, greek, orthodox, church, played, a, pivotal, role, in, the, preservation, of, national, identity, the, development, of, greek, society, and, the, resurgence, of, greek, nationalism, from, the, early, 18th, century, and, onwards, members, of, prominent, greek, families, in, constantinople, known, as, phanariotes, after, the, phanar, district, of, the, city, gained, considerable, control, over, ottoman, foreign, policy, and, eventually, over, the, bureaucracy, as, a, whole, in, times, of, militarily, weak, central, authority, the, balkan, countryside, became, infested, by, groups, of, bandits, called, klephts, greek, the, greek, equivalent, of, the, hajduks, that, struck, at, muslims, and, christians, alike, defying, ottoman, rule, the, klephts, were, highly, admired, and, held, a, significant, place, in, popular, lore, responding, to, the, klephts, attacks, the, ottomans, recruited, the, ablest, amongst, these, groups, contracting, christian, militias, known, as, armatoloi, greek, to, secure, endangered, areas, especially, mountain, passes, the, area, under, their, control, was, called, an, armatolik, the, oldest, known, being, established, in, agrafa, during, the, reign, of, murad, ii, r, 1421, 1451, the, distinction, between, klephts, and, armatoloi, was, not, clear, as, the, latter, would, often, turn, into, klephts, to, extort, more, benefits, from, the, authorities, while, conversely, another, klepht, group, would, be, appointed, to, the, armatolik, to, confront, their, predecessors, nevertheless, klephts, and, armatoloi, formed, a, provincial, elite, though, not, a, social, class, whose, members, would, muster, under, a, common, goal, as, the, armatoloi, s, position, gradually, turned, into, a, hereditary, one, some, captains, took, care, of, their, armatolik, as, their, personal, property, a, great, deal, of, power, was, placed, in, their, hands, and, they, integrated, in, the, network, of, clientelist, relationships, that, formed, the, ottoman, administration, some, managed, to, establish, exclusive, control, in, their, armatolik, forcing, the, porte, to, try, repeatedly, though, unsuccessfully, to, eliminate, them, by, the, time, of, the, war, of, independence, powerful, armatoloi, could, be, traced, in, rumeli, thessaly, epirus, and, southern, macedonia, to, the, revolutionary, leader, and, writer, yannis, makriyannis, klephts, and, armatoloi, being, the, only, available, major, military, force, on, the, side, of, the, greeks, played, such, a, crucial, role, in, the, greek, revolution, that, he, referred, to, them, as, the, yeast, of, liberty, contrary, to, conventional, greek, history, many, of, the, klephts, and, armatoles, participated, at, the, greek, war, of, independence, according, to, their, own, militaristic, patron, client, terms, they, saw, the, war, as, an, economic, and, political, opportunity, to, expand, their, areas, of, operation, balkan, bandits, such, as, the, klephts, and, armatoles, glorified, in, nationalist, historiography, as, national, heroes, were, actually, driven, by, economic, interests, were, not, aware, of, national, projects, made, alliances, with, the, ottomans, and, robbed, christians, as, much, as, muslims, nevertheless, they, seldom, robbed, common, folk, from, whose, ranks, they, came, and, more, often, raided, turks, with, whom, they, were, separated, by, religion, nationality, and, social, class, they, enjoyed, the, support, of, the, generally, oppressed, common, folk, as, they, were, in, opposition, to, established, authority, a, vast, oral, tradition, of, folk, poetry, attests, to, the, sympathy, they, evoked, and, their, reputation, for, patriotism, some, famous, armatoles, leaders, were, odysseas, androutsos, georgios, karaiskakis, athanasios, diakos, markos, botsaris, and, giannis, stathas, due, to, economic, developments, within, and, outside, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, 18th, century, greek, merchants, and, sailors, became, affluent, and, generated, the, wealth, necessary, to, found, schools, and, libraries, and, to, pay, for, young, greeks, to, study, at, the, universities, of, western, europe, there, they, came, into, contact, with, the, radical, ideas, of, the, european, enlightenment, the, french, revolution, and, romantic, nationalism, educated, and, influential, members, of, the, large, greek, diaspora, such, as, adamantios, korais, and, anthimos, gazis, tried, to, transmit, these, ideas, back, to, the, greeks, with, the, double, aim, of, raising, their, educational, level, and, simultaneously, strengthening, their, national, identity, this, was, achieved, through, the, dissemination, of, books, pamphlets, and, other, writings, in, greek, in, a, process, that, has, been, described, as, the, modern, greek, enlightenment, greek, crucial, for, the, development, of, the, greek, national, idea, were, the, russo, turkish, wars, of, the, 18th, century, peter, the, great, had, envisaged, a, disintegration, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, re, institution, of, a, new, byzantine, empire, with, an, orthodox, emperor, his, pruth, river, campaign, of, 1711, set, a, precedent, for, the, greeks, when, peter, appealed, to, orthodox, christians, to, join, the, russians, and, rise, against, the, turks, to, fight, for, faith, and, homeland, the, russo, turkish, wars, of, catherine, ii, 1762, 1796, made, the, greeks, consider, their, emancipation, with, the, aid, of, russia, an, independence, movement, in, peloponnesus, morea, was, incited, by, russian, agents, in, 1769, and, a, greek, flotilla, under, lambros, katsonis, assisted, the, russian, fleet, in, the, war, of, 1788, 1792, the, greek, revolts, of, the, 18th, century, were, unsuccessful, but, far, larger, than, the, revolts, of, previous, centuries, and, they, laid, the, foundation, for, a, national, revolution, revolutionary, nationalism, grew, across, europe, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, including, in, the, balkans, due, to, the, influence, of, the, french, revolution, as, the, power, of, the, ottoman, empire, declined, greek, nationalism, began, to, assert, itself, the, most, influential, of, the, greek, writers, and, intellectuals, was, rigas, feraios, deeply, influenced, by, the, french, revolution, rigas, was, the, first, to, conceive, and, organize, a, comprehensive, national, movement, aiming, at, the, liberation, of, all, balkan, nations, including, the, turks, of, the, region, and, the, creation, of, a, balkan, republic, arrested, by, austrian, officials, in, trieste, in, 1797, he, was, handed, over, to, ottoman, officials, and, transported, to, belgrade, along, with, his, co, conspirators, all, of, them, were, strangled, to, death, in, june, 1798, and, their, bodies, were, dumped, in, the, danube, the, death, of, rigas, fanned, the, flames, of, greek, nationalism, his, nationalist, poem, the, thourios, war, song, was, translated, into, a, number, of, western, european, and, later, balkan, languages, and, served, as, a, rallying, cry, for, greeks, against, ottoman, rule, another, influential, greek, writer, and, intellectual, was, adamantios, korais, who, witnessed, the, french, revolution, korais, primary, intellectual, inspiration, was, from, the, enlightenment, and, he, borrowed, ideas, from, thomas, hobbes, john, locke, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, when, korais, was, a, young, adult, he, moved, to, paris, to, continue, his, studies, he, eventually, graduated, from, the, montpellier, school, of, medicine, and, spent, the, remainder, of, his, life, in, paris, he, would, often, have, political, and, philosophical, debates, with, thomas, jefferson, while, in, paris, he, was, a, witness, to, the, french, revolution, and, saw, the, democracy, that, came, out, of, it, he, spent, a, lot, of, his, time, convincing, wealthy, greeks, to, build, schools, and, libraries, to, further, the, education, of, greeks, he, believed, that, a, furthering, in, education, would, be, necessary, for, the, general, welfare, and, prosperity, of, the, people, of, greece, as, well, as, the, country, korais, ultimate, goal, was, a, democratic, greece, much, like, the, golden, age, of, pericles, the, greek, cause, began, to, draw, support, not, only, from, the, large, greek, merchant, diaspora, in, both, western, europe, and, russia, but, also, from, western, european, philhellenes, this, greek, movement, for, independence, was, not, only, the, first, movement, of, national, character, in, eastern, europe, but, also, the, first, one, in, a, non, christian, environment, like, the, ottoman, empire, feraios, martyrdom, was, to, inspire, three, young, greek, merchants, nikolaos, skoufas, emmanuil, xanthos, and, athanasios, tsakalov, influenced, by, the, italian, carbonari, and, profiting, from, their, own, experience, as, members, of, freemasonic, organizations, they, founded, in, 1814, the, secret, filiki, eteria, friendly, society, in, odessa, an, important, center, of, the, greek, mercantile, diaspora, in, russia, with, the, support, of, wealthy, greek, exile, communities, in, britain, and, the, united, states, and, with, the, aid, of, sympathizers, in, western, europe, they, planned, the, rebellion, the, society, s, basic, objective, was, a, revival, of, the, byzantine, empire, with, constantinople, as, the, capital, not, the, formation, of, a, national, state, in, early, 1820, ioannis, kapodistrias, an, official, from, the, ionian, islands, who, had, become, the, joint, foreign, minister, of, tsar, alexander, i, was, approached, by, the, society, in, order, to, be, named, leader, but, declined, the, offer, the, filikoi, members, of, filiki, eteria, then, turned, to, alexander, ypsilantis, a, phanariote, serving, in, the, russian, army, as, general, and, adjutant, to, alexander, who, accepted, the, filiki, eteria, expanded, rapidly, and, was, soon, able, to, recruit, members, in, all, areas, of, the, greek, world, and, among, all, elements, of, the, greek, society, in, 1821, the, ottoman, empire, mainly, faced, war, against, persia, and, more, particularly, the, revolt, by, ali, pasha, in, epirus, which, had, forced, the, vali, governor, of, the, morea, hursid, pasha, and, other, local, pashas, to, leave, their, provinces, and, campaign, against, the, rebel, force, at, the, same, time, the, great, powers, allied, in, the, concert, of, europe, in, opposition, to, revolutions, in, the, aftermath, of, napoleon, i, of, france, were, preoccupied, with, revolts, in, italy, and, spain, it, was, in, this, context, that, the, greeks, judged, the, time, ripe, for, their, own, revolt, the, plan, originally, involved, uprisings, in, three, places, the, peloponnese, the, danubian, principalities, and, constantinople, the, mountains, look, on, marathon, and, marathon, looks, on, the, sea, and, musing,

lukewarm, and, negative, reception, from, the, great, powers, some, historians, argue, that, ottoman, atrocities, were, given, wide, coverage, in, europe, while, greek, atrocities, tended, to, be,

church, s, policy, instead, of, directly, advancing, on, br, ila, where, he, arguably, could, have, prevented, ottoman, armies, from, entering, the, principalities, and, where, he, might, have, forced, russia, to, accept, a, fait, accompli, ypsilantis, remained, in, ia, i, and, ordered, the, executions, of, several, pro, ottoman, moldavians, in, bucharest, where, he, arrived, in, early, april, after, some, weeks, delay, he, decided, that, he, could, not, rely, on, the, wallachian, pandurs, to, continue, their, oltenian, based, revolt, and, assist, the, greek, cause, the, pandur, leader, was, tudor, vladimirescu, who, had, already, reached, the, outskirts, of, bucharest, on, 16, march, in, bucharest, the, relations, of, the, two, men, deteriorated, dramatically, vladimirescu, s, first, priority, was, to, assert, his, authority, against, the, newly, appointed, prince, scarlat, callimachi, trying, to, maintain, relations, with, both, russia, and, the, ottomans, at, that, point, kapodistrias, the, foreign, minister, of, russia, was, ordered, by, alexander, i, to, send, ypsilantis, a, letter, upbraiding, him, for, misusing, the, mandate, received, from, the, tsar,

vladimirescu, took, this, as, the, end, of, his, alliance, with, the, eteria, a, conflict, erupted, inside, the, camp, and, vladimirescu, was, tried, and, put, to, death, by, the, eteria, on, 26, may, the, loss, of, their, romanian, allies, followed, by, an, ottoman, intervention, on, wallachian, soil, sealed, defeat, for, the, greek, exiles, and, culminated, in, the, disastrous, battle, of, dragashani, and, the, destruction, of, the, sacred, band, on, 7, june, alexander, ypsilantis, accompanied, by, his, brother, nicholas, and, a, remnant, of, his, followers, retreated, to, r, mnicu, v, lcea, where, he, spent, some, days, negotiating, with, the, austrian, authorities, for, permission, to, cross, the, frontier, fearing, that, his, followers, might, surrender, him, to, the, turks, he,

near, kalavryta, achaea, although, some, historians, question, the, historicity, of, the, event, some, claim, that, the, story, first, appears, in, 1824, in, a, book, written, by, a, french, diplomat, fran, ois, pouqueville, whose, book, is, full, of, inventions, historian, david, brewer, noted, that, pouqueville, was, an, anglophobe, and, in, his, account, of, the, speech, by, germanos, in, his, book, pouqueville, has, the, metropolitan, express, anglophobic, sentiments, similar, to, those, commonly, expressed, in, france, and, has, him, praise, france, as, greece, s, one, true, friend, in, the, world, which, led, brewer, to, conclude, that, pouqueville, had, made, the, entire, story, up, however, a, study, on, the, archive, of, hugues, pouqueville, fran, ois, pouqueville, s, brother, claims, that, fran, ois, account, was, accurate, without, making, any, reference, to, the, purported, anglophobia, or, francophilia, of, germanos, also, some, european, newspapers, of, june, and,

entitled, to, call, upon, the, classical, heritage, as, a, reason, for, support, and, that, greece, would, only, achieve, progress, with, freedom, from, the, ottoman, empire, a, young, medical, student, in, mannheim, wrote, that, hearing, his, professor, lecture, on, the, need, for, greek, freedom, went, through, him, like, an, electric, shock, inspiring, him, to, drop, his, studies, and, head, to, greece, while, a, danish, student, wrote, how, could, a, man, inclined, to, fight, for, freedom, and, justice, find, a, better, place, than, next, to, the, oppressed, greeks, in, france,

assuredly, imitate, the, culpable, indifference, or, rather, the, long, ingratitude, of, the, europeans, going, on, to, call, for, american, intervention, in, several, american, newspapers, in, 1821, the, greek, committee, in, charleston, south, carolina, sent, the, greeks, 50, barrels, of, salted, meat, while, the, greek, committee, in, springfield, massachusetts, sent, supplies, of, salted,

january, 1822, in, the, letter, sent, to, greek, expatriates, living, in, france, adamantios, korais, christodoulos, klonaris, konstantinos, polychroniades, and, a, bogorides, who, had, assembled, themselves, into, a, committee, which, was, seeking, international, support, for, the, ongoing, greek, revolution, boyer, expressed, his, support, for, the, greek, revolution, and, compared, the, struggle, underfoot, across, the, atlantic, to, the, struggle, for, independence, in, his, own, land, he, apologized, for, being, unable, to, support, the, revolution, in, greece, financially, though, he, hoped, he, might, be, able, to, in, the, future, but, he, articulated, his, moral, and, political, support, for, the, revolution, notably, by, filling, his, letter, with, references, to, classical, greek, history, demonstrating, a, detailed, knowledge, of, this, history, and, powerfully, evoking, the, contemporary, revolutionaries, as, the, rightful, heirs, of, their, ancestors, some, historians, claim, that, boyer, also, sent, to, the, greeks, 25, tons, of, haitian, coffee, that, could, be, sold, and, the, proceeds, used, to, purchase, weapons, but, not, enough, evidence, exists, to, support, this, or, the, other, claim, that, one, hundred, haitian, volunteers, set, off, to, fight, in, the, greek, revolution, allegedly, their, ship, was, boarded, by, pirates, somewhere, in, the, mediterranean, and, these, fighters, purportedly, never, reached, their, destination, after, the, fall, of, kalamata, the, messenian, senate, the, first, of, the, greeks, local, governing, councils, held, its, inaugural, session, at, almost, the, same, time, the, achean, directorate, was, summoned, in, patras, but, its, members, were, soon, forced, to, flee, to, kalavryta, with, the, initiative, of, the, messenian, senate, a, peloponnesian, assembly, convened, and, elected, a, senate, on, 26, may, most, of, the, members, of, the, peloponnesian, senate, were, local, notables, lay, and, ecclesiastical, or, persons, controlled, by, them, the, three, major, social, groups, that, provided, the, leadership, of, the, revolution, were, the, primates, wealthy, landowners, who, controlled, about, a, third, of, the, arable, land, in, the, peloponnese, the, captains, drawn, from, the, klephts, and, or, armatolos, klepts, and, armatolos, tended, to, alternate, and, the, wealthy, merchants, who, were, the, most, westernised, elements, in, greek, society, one, of, the, more, prominent, leaders, of, the, merchants, and, a, westerniser, was, the, phanariot, alexandros, mavrokordatos, who, was, living, with, the, poet, percy, bysshe, shelley, and, his, wife, mary, shelley, in, pisa, when, the, revolution, began, and, upon, hearing, of, the, revolution, purchased, supplies, and, a, ship, in, marseilles, and, then, set, sail, for, greece, mavrokordhatos, s, wealth, education, he, was, fluent, in, seven, languages, and, his, experience, as, an, ottoman, official, ruling, wallachia, led, many, to, look, towards, him, as, a, leader, when, demetrios, ypsilantis, arrived, in, peloponnese, as, official, representative, of, filiki, eteria, he, tried, to, assume, control, of, the, revolution, s, affairs, and, he, thus, proposed, a, new, system, of, electing, the, members, of, the, senate, which, was, supported, by, the, military, leaders, but, opposed, by, the, notables, assemblies, convened, also, in, central, greece, november, 1821, under, the, leadership, of, two, phanariots, alexandros, mavrokordatos, in, the, western, part, and, theodoros, negris, in, the, eastern, part, these, assemblies, adopted, two, local, statutes, the, charter, of, western, continental, greece, and, the, legal, order, of, eastern, continental, greece, drafted, mainly, by, mavrokordatos, and, negris, respectively, the, statutes, provided, for, the, creation, of, two, local, administrative, organs, in, central, greece, an, areopagus, in, the, east, and, a, senate, in, the, west, the, three, local, statutes, were, recognized, by, the, first, national, assembly, but, the, respective, administrative, institutions, were, turned, into, administrative, branches, of, the, central, government, they, were, later, dissolved, by, the, second, national, assembly, cretan, participation, in, the, revolution, was, extensive, but, it, failed, to, achieve, liberation, from, turkish, rule, because, of, egyptian, intervention, crete, had, a, long, history, of, resisting, turkish, rule, exemplified, by, the, folk, hero, daskalogiannis, who, was, killed, while, fighting, the, turks, in, 1821, an, uprising, by, christians, was, met, with, a, fierce, response, from, the, ottoman, authorities, and, the, execution, of, several, bishops, regarded, as, ringleaders, despite, the, turkish, reaction, the, rebellion, persisted, and, thus, sultan, mahmud, ii, r, 1808, 1839, was, forced, to, seek, the, aid, of, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, trying, to, lure, him, with, the, pashalik, of, crete, on, 28, may, 1822, an, egyptian, fleet, of, 30, warships, and, 84, transports, arrived, at, souda, bay, led, by, hasan, pasha, muhammad, ali, s, son, in, law, he, was, tasked, with, ending, the, rebellion, and, did, not, waste, any, time, in, the, burning, of, villages, throughout, crete, after, hasan, s, accidental, death, in, february, 1823, another, son, in, law, of,

of, local, captains, and, unite, them, against, the, common, threat, he, then, gathered, 3, 000, men, in, gergeri, to, face, hussein, but, the, cretans, were, defeated, by, the, much, larger, and, better, organised, force, and, lost, 300, men, at, the, battle, of, amourgelles, on, 20, august, 1823, by, the, spring, of, 1824, hussein, had, managed, to, limit, the, cretan, resistance, to, just, a, few, mountain, enclaves, towards, the, summer, of, 1825, a, body, of, three, to, four, hundred, cretans, who, had, fought, with, other, greeks, in, the, peloponnese, arrived, in, crete, and, revitalized, the, cretan, insurgency, the, so, called, gramvousa, period, on, 9, august, 1825, led, by, dimitrios, kallergis, and, emmanouil, antoniadis, this, group, of, cretans, captured, the, fort, at, gramvousa, and, other, insurgents, captured, the, fort, at, kissamos, and, attempted, to, spread, the, insurgency, further, afield, although, the, ottomans, did, not, manage, to, retake, the, forts, they, were, successful, in, blocking, the, spread, of, the, insurgency, to, the, island, s, western, provinces, the, insurgents, were, besieged, in, gramvousa, for, more, than, two, years, and, they, had, to, resort, to, piracy, to, survive, gramvousa, became, a, hive, of, piratical, activity, that, greatly, affected, turkish, egyptian, and, european, shipping, in, the, region, during, that,

proportion, of, the, total, population, of, the, island, at, the, time, k, k, pasha, had, declared, i, have, in, my, mind, to, slaughter, the, greeks, in, cyprus, to, hang, them, to, not, leave, a,

yet, stood, by, the, greek, cause, he, is, revered, throughout, cyprus, as, a, noble, patriot, and, defender, of, the, orthodox, faith, and, hellenic, cause, an, english, explorer, by, the, name, of, carne, spoke, to, the, archbishop, before, the, events, of, 9, july, who, was, quoted, as, saying, my, death, is, not, far, away, i, know, they, are, waiting, for, an, opportunity, to, kill, me, kyprianos, chose, to, stay, despite, these, fears, and, provide, protection, and, counsel, for, the, people, of, cyprus, as, their, leader, he, was, publicly, hanged, from, a, tree, opposite, the, former, palace, of, the, lusignan, kings, of, cyprus, on, 19, july, 1821, the, events, leading, up, to, his, execution, were, documented, in, an, epic, poem, written, in, the, cypriot, dialect, by, vassilis, michaelides, from, the, early, stages, of, the, revolution, success, at, sea, was, vital, for, the, greeks, when, they, failed, to, counter, the, ottoman, navy, it, was, able, to, resupply, the, isolated, ottoman, garrisons, and, land, reinforcements, from, the, ottoman, empire, s, provinces, threatening, to, crush, the, rebellion, likewise, the, failure, of, the, greek, fleet, to, break, the, naval, blockade, of, messolonghi, as, it, did, several, times, earlier, in, 1826, led, to, the, fall, of, the, city, the, greek, fleet, was, primarily, outfitted, by, prosperous, aegean, islanders, principally, from, the, islands, of, hydra, and, spetses, as, well, as, from, psara, the, albanian, speaking, seamen, of, hydra, and, spetses, provided, the, core, of, the, greek, fleet, and, leading, members, of, the, greek, government, among, them, a, one, wartime, president, they, in, some, cases, used, albanian, with, each, other, to, prevent, others, on, their, side, from, reading, their, correspondence, each, island, equipped, manned, and, maintained, its, own, squadron, under, its, own, admiral, although, they, were, manned, by, experienced, crews, the, greek, ships, were, not, designed, for, warfare, being, armed, merchantmen, equipped, with, only, light, guns, against, them, stood, the, ottoman, fleet, which, enjoyed, several, advantages, its, ships, and, supporting, craft, were, built, for, war, it, was, supported, by, the, resources, of, the, vast, ottoman, empire, command, was, centralized, and, disciplined, under, the, kapudan, pasha, the, total, ottoman, fleet, size, consisted, of, 20, three, masted, ships, of, the, line, each, with, about, 80, guns, and, 7, or, 8, frigates, with, 50, guns, 5, corvettes, with, about, 30, guns, and, around, 40, brigs, with, 20, or, fewer, guns, complemented, by, squadrons, from, the, maghrebi, vassal, states, algiers, tripoli, and, tunis, and, egypt, in, the, face, of, this, situation, the, greeks, decided, to, use, fire, ships, greek, or, which, had, proven, themselves, effective, for, the, psarians, during, the, orlov, revolt, in, 1770, the, first, test, was, made, at, eresos, on, 27, may, 1821, when, an, ottoman, frigate, was, successfully, destroyed, by, a, fire, ship, under, dimitrios, papanikolis, in, the, fire, ships, the, greeks, found, an, effective, weapon, against, the, ottoman, vessels, in, subsequent, years, the, successes, of, the, greek, fire, ships, would, increase, their, reputation, with, acts, such, as, the, destruction, of, the, ottoman, flagship, by, konstantinos, kanaris, at, chios, after, the, massacre, of, the, island, s, population, in, june, 1822, acquiring, international, fame, at, the, same, time, conventional, naval, actions, were, also, fought, at, which, naval, commanders, like, andreas, miaoulis, distinguished, themselves, the, early, successes, of, the, greek, fleet, in, direct, confrontations, with, the, ottomans, at, patras, and, spetses, gave, the, crews, confidence, and, contributed, greatly, to, the, survival, and, success, of, the, uprising, in, the, peloponnese, later, however, as, greece, became, embroiled, in, a, civil, war, the, sultan, called, upon, his, strongest, subject, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, for, aid, plagued, by, internal, strife, and, financial, difficulties, in, keeping, the, fleet, in, constant, readiness, the, greeks, failed, to, prevent, the, capture, and, destruction, of, kasos, and, psara, in, 1824, or, the, landing, of, the, egyptian, army, at, methoni, despite, victories, at, samos, and, gerontas, the, revolution, was, threatened, with, collapse, until, the, intervention, of, the, great, powers, in, the, battle, of, navarino, in, 1827, revolutionary, activity, was, fragmented, because, of, the, lack, of, strong, central, leadership, and, guidance, however, the, greek, side, withstood, the, turkish, attacks, because, the, ottoman, military, campaigns, were, periodic, and, the, ottoman, presence, in, the, rebel, areas, was, uncoordinated, due, to, logistical, problems, the, cash, strapped, ottoman, state, s, relations, with, russia, always, difficult, had, been, made, worse, by, the, hanging, of, patriarch, grigorios, and, the, sublime, porte, needed, to, concentrate, substantial, forces, on, the, russian, border, in, case, war, broke, out, from, october, 1820, to, july, 1823, the, ottomans, were, at, war, with, persia, and, in, march, 1823, a, huge, fire, at, the, tophana, military, arsenal, in, constantinople, destroyed, much, of, the, ottoman, state, s, supplies, of, ammunition, and, its, main, cannon, foundry, short, of, men, and, money, the, ottoman, state, turned, to, hiring, albanian, tribesmen, to, fight, the, greeks, and, by, 1823, the, bulk, of, the, ottoman, forces, in, greece, were, albanian, mercenaries, hired, for, a, campaigning, season, rather, than, the, ottoman, army, the, albanian, tribesmen, whose, style, of, war, was, very, similar, to, the, greeks, fought, only, for, money, and, were, liable, to, go, home, when, not, paid, or, able, to, plunder, in, lieu, of, pay, the, greek, military, leaders, preferred, battlefields, where, they, could, annihilate, the, numerical, superiority, of, the, opponent, and, at, the, same, time, the, lack, of, artillery, hampered, ottoman, military, efforts, on, 11, april, 1822, the, ottoman, fleet, under, the, kapitan, pasha, kara, ali, arrived, on, the, island, of, chios, the, ottoman, sailors, and, soldiers, promptly, went, on, a, rampage, killing, and, raping, without, mercy, as, one, contemporary, recalled, mercy, was, out, of, the, question, the, victors, butchering, indiscriminately, all, who, came, in, their, way, shrieks, rent, the, air, and, the, streets, were, strewn, with, the, dead, bodies, of, old, men, women, and, children, even, the, inmates, of, the, hospital, the, madhouse, and, deaf, and, dumb, institution, were, inhumanely, slaughtered, before, kara, ali, s, fleet, had, arrived, chios, had, between, 100, 000, and, 120, 000, greeks, living, there, of, which, some, 25, 000, were, killed, in, the, massacre, with, another, 45, 000, mostly, women, and, children, sold, into, slavery, the, chios, massacre, shocked, all, of, europe, and, further, increased, public, sympathy, for, the, greek, cause, the, greeks, avenged, the, massacre, on, the, night, of, 18, june, 1822, when, the, ottoman, fleet, were, busy, celebrating, the, end, of, the, sacred, muslim, holiday, of, ramadan, which, the, greek, fleet, under, admiral, konstantinos, kanaris, and, andreas, pipinos, took, advantage, of, to, launch, a, fire, ship, attack, as, kara, ali, s, ship, was, brightly, lit, as, befitting, the, kapitan, pasha, a, fire, ship, under, kanaris, was, able, to, strike, his, ship, causing, the, ottoman, flagship, to, blow, up, of, the, 2, 286, or, so, aboard, the, flagship, only, 180, survived, but, many, of, the, dead, were, chians, enslaved, by, kara, ali, who, was, planning, on, selling, them, on, the, slave, markets, when, he, reached, constantinople, in, july, 1822, the, greeks, and, philhellenes, at, the, battle, of, peta, under, alexandros, mavrokordatos, inflicted, much, punishment, on, an, ottoman, army, commanded, by, omer, vrioni, but, reflecting, the, chronic, factionalism, and, disunity, that, characterized, the, greek, war, effort, were, undone, when, one, of, the, greek, captains, gogos, bakolas, betrayed, his, own, side, to, the, ottomans, allowing, albanian, infantry, to, advance, up, the, ridge, the, battle, ended, in, an, ottoman, victory, and, with, most, of, the, philhellenes, killed, the, successive, military, campaigns, of, the, ottomans, in, western, and, eastern, greece, were, repulsed, in, 1822, mahmud, dramali, pasha, crossed, roumeli, and, invaded, morea, but, suffered, a, serious, defeat, in, the, dervenakia, theodoros, kolokotronis, who, annihilated, dramali, pasha, s, army, at, dervenakia, became, the, hero, of, the, hour, attracting, much, praise, all, over, greece, the, greek, government, had, been, desperately, short, of, money, since, the, start, of, the, revolution, and, in, february, 1823, the, banker, andr, as, louri, tis, arrived, in, london, seeking, a, loan, from, the, city, assisted, by, the, london, greek, committee, which, included, several, mps, and, intellectuals, louri, tis, began, to, lobby, the, city, for, a, loan, british, philhellene, edward, blaquiere, issued, a, report, in, september, 1823, which, grossly, exaggerated, greece, s, economic, prosperity, and, claimed, that, once, independent, greece, would, easily, become, one, of, the, most, opulent, nations, of, europe, blaquiere, further, assisted, the, campaign, by, publishing, two, books, in, 1824, in, which, he, claimed, i, should, have, no, hesitation, whatever, in, estimating, the, physical, strength, of, regenerated, greece, to, be, fully, equal, to, the, whole, south, american, continent, concluding, there, was, no, part, of, the, world, with, a, more, productive, soil, or, happier, climate, than, greece, of, all, the, countries, or, governments, who, have, borrowed, money, in, london, within, the, last, ten, years, greece, possesses, the, surest, and, most, ample, means, of, re, payment, the, 1823, campaign, in, western, greece, was, led, by, northern, albanian, forces, under, mustafa, reshit, pasha, from, the, pashalik, of, scutari, and, southern, albanian, forces, under, omer, vrioni, from, the, former, pashalik, of, yanina, during, the, summer, the, souliot, markos, botsaris, was, shot, dead, at, the, battle, of, karpenisi, in, his, attempt, to, stop, the, advance, of, ottoman, albanian, forces, the, announcement, of, his, death, in, europe, generated, a, wave, of, sympathy, for, the, greek, cause, the, campaign, ended, after, the, second, siege, of, missolonghi, in, december, 1823, in, february, 1824, the, loan, for, greece, was, floated, in, the, city, attracting, some, 472, 000, pounds, sterling, 17, 4, million, in, 2021, which, was, money, that, the, greeks, badly, needed, the, first, national, assembly, was, formed, at, epidaurus, in, late, december, 1821, consisting, almost, exclusively, of, peloponnesian, notables, the, assembly, drafted, the, first, greek, constitution, and, appointed, the, members, of, an, executive, and, a, legislative, body, that, were, to, govern, the, liberated, territories, mavrokordatos, saved, the, office, of, president, of, the, executive, for, himself, while, ypsilantis, who, had, called, for, the, assembly, was, elected, president, of, the, legislative, body, a, place, of, limited, significance, military, leaders, and, representatives, of, filiki, eteria, were, marginalized, but, gradually, kolokotronis, political, influence, grew, and, he, soon, managed, to, control, along, with, the, captains, he, influenced, the, peloponnesian, senate, the, central, administration, tried, to, marginalize, kolokotronis, who, also, had, under, his, control, the, fort, of, nafplion, in, november, 1822, the, central, administration, decided, that, the, new, national, assembly, would, take, place, in, nafplion, and, asked, kolokotronis, to, return, the, fort, to, the, government, kolokotronis, refused, and, the, assembly, was, finally, gathered, in, march, 1823, in, astros, central, governance, was, strengthened, at, the, expense, of, regional, bodies, a, new, constitution, was, voted, and, new, members, were, elected, for, the, executive, and, the, legislative, bodies, trying, to, coax, the, military, leaders, the, central, administration, proposed, to, kolokotronis, that, he, participate, in, the, executive, body, as, vice, president, kolokotronis, accepted, but, he, caused, a, serious, crisis, when, he, prevented, mavrokordatos, who, had, been, elected, president, of, the, legislative, body, from, assuming, his, position, his, attitude, towards, mavrokordatos, caused, outrage, amongst, the, members, of, the, legislative, body, the, crisis, culminated, when, the, legislature, which, was, controlled, by, the, roumeliotes, and, the, hydriots, overturned, the, executive, and, fired, its, president, petros, mavromichalis, kolokotronis, and, most, of, the, peloponnesian, notables, and, captains, supported, mavromichalis, who, remained, president, of, his, executive, in, tripolitsa, however, a, second, executive, supported, by, the, islanders, the, roumeliotes, and, some, achaean, notables, andreas, zaimis, and,

after, one, month, of, fighting, and, negotiations, an, agreement, was, reached, between, kolokotronis, from, one, side, and, londos, and, zaimis, from, the, other, side, on, 22, may, the, first, phase, of, the, civil, war, officially, ended, but, most, of, the, members, of, the, new, executive, were, displeased, by, the, moderate, terms, of, the, agreement, that, londos, and, zaimis, brokered, during, this, period, the, two, first, installments, of, the, english, loan, had, arrived, and, the, position, of, the, government, was, strengthened, but, the, infighting, was, not, yet, over, zaimis, and, the, other, peloponnesians, who, supported, kountouriotis, came, into, conflict, with, the, executive, body, and, allied, with, kolokotronis, who, roused, the, residents, of, tripolitsa, against, the, local, tax, collectors, of, the, government, papaflessas, and, makriyannis, failed, to, suppress, the, rebellion, but, kolokotronis, remained, inactive, for, some, period, overwhelmed, by, the, death, of, his, son, panos, the, government, regrouped, its, armies, which, now, consisted, mainly, of, roumeliotes, and, orthodox, christian, albanian, souliotes, led, by,

of, muhammad, ali, s, troops, in, both, places, settled, the, turks, on, the, horns, of, a, very, difficult, dilemma, since, they, were, afraid, of, their, w, li, s, expansionist, ambitions, muhammad, ali, finally, agreed, to, send, his, son, ibrahim, pasha, to, greece, in, exchange, not, only, for, crete, and, cyprus, but, for, the, peloponnese, and, syria, as, well, on, 7, february, 1825, a, second, loan, to, greece, was, floated, in, the, city, of, london, although, the, greek, government, had, squandered, the, money, from, the, first, loan, the, second, loan, was, oversubscribed, and, raised, some, 1, 1, million, 404, million, in, 2021, unlike, the, first, loan, the, second, loan, from, the, city, was, to, be, managed, by, a, board, of, control, in, london, consisting, of, the, banker, samson, ricardo, two, mps, edward, ellice, and, sir, francis, burdett, and, john, cam, hobhouse, of, the, london, greek, committee, who, were, to, use, the, money, to, buy, warships, and, other, supplies, which, would, then, be, handed, over, to, the, greeks, after, the, greek, government, had, wasted, most, of, the, money, from, the, first, loan, the, city, did, not, trust, them, to, spend, the, money, from, the, second, loan, wisely, the, board, of, control, used, the, money, to, hire, the, naval, hero, lord, cochrane, to, command, the, greek, navy, and, to, buy, steamships, one, of, the, british, philhellenes, frank, abney, hastings, believed, that, the, use, of, mechanised, warships, powered, by, steam, and, using, red, hot, shot, would, allow, the, greeks, to, overpower, the, ottoman, navy, powered, as, it, was, by, sail, hastings, persuaded, the, board, of, control, to, invest, in, the, revolutionary, technology, of, the, steamship, making, the, first, use, of, a, mechanised, warship, in, a, war, the, two, loans, from, the, city, caused, significant, financial, difficulties, for, the, young, nation, and, in, 1878, a, deal, was, struck, between, the, creditors, and, the, greek, government, to, reduce, the, loans, now, worth, 10, million, with, unpaid, interest, down, to, 1, 5, million, pounds, sterling, ibrahim, pasha, landed, at, methoni, on, 24, february, 1825, and, a, month, later, he, was, joined, by, his, army, of, 10, 000, infantry, and, 1, 000, cavalry, the, greeks, had, not, expected, ibrahim, pasha, to, land, during, the, stormy, winter, weather, and, were, taken, by, surprise, the, greeks, initially, laughed, at, the, egyptian, soldiers, who, were, short, skinny, fall, n, peasant, conscripts, many, of, them, blind, in, one, eye, owing, to, the, prevalence, of, parasitic, worms, that, attacked, the, eye, in, the, nile, wearing, cheap, red, uniforms, comprising, a, jacket, trousers, and, a, skull, cap, however, the, greeks, soon, learned, that, the, egyptians, who, were, trained, by, french, officers, recruited, by, mohammed, ali, were, tough, and, hardy, soldiers, who, unlike, the, turkish, and, albanian, units, that, the, greeks, had, been, fighting, until, then, stood, their, ground, in, combat, ibrahim, proceeded, to, defeat, the, greek, garrison, on, the, small, island, of, sphacteria, off, the, coast, of, messenia, with, the, greeks, in, disarray, ibrahim, ravaged, the, western, peloponnese, and, killed, papaflessas, at, the, battle, of, maniaki, to, try, to, stop, ibrahim, kanaris, led, the, raid, on, alexandria, an, attempt, to, destroy, the, egyptian, fleet, that, failed, due, to, a, sudden, change, of, the, wind, the, british, traveller, and, church, of, england, minister, reverend, charles, swan, reported, ibrahim, pasha, as, saying, to, him, that, he, would, burn, and, destroy, the, whole, morea, popular, opinion, in, both, greece, and, the, rest, of, europe, soon, credited, ibrahim, pasha, with, the, so, called, barbarisation, project, where, it, was, alleged, that, ibrahim, planned, to, deport, the, entire, christian, greek, population, to, egypt, as, slaves, and, replace, them, with, egyptian, peasants, it, is, not, clear, even, today, if, the, barbarisation, project, was, a, real, plan, or, not, but, the, possibility, that, it, was, created, strong, demands, for, humanitarian, intervention, in, europe, the, porte, and, mohammed, ali, both, denied, having, plans, for, the, barbarisation, project, but, pointedly, refused, to, put, their, denials, into, writing, russia, warned, that, if, the, barbarisation, project, was, a, real, plan, then, such, an, egregious, violation, of, the, treaty, of, k, k, kaynarca, under, which, russia, had, a, vague, claim, to, be, the, protector, of, all, the, orthodox, peoples, of, the, ottoman, empire, would, lead, to, russia, going, to, war, against, the, ottomans, in, turn, the, british, foreign, secretary, george, canning, wrote, rather, than, run, the, risk, of, russia, defeating, the, ottomans, alone, britain, would, have, to, intervene, to, stop, the, barbarisation, project, as, the, british, did, not, wish, to, see, the, russians, conquer, the, ottoman, empire, while, diplomats, and, statesmen, debated, what, to, do, in, london, and, st, petersburg, the, egyptian, advance, continued, in, greece, the, greek, government, in, an, attempt, to, stop, the, egyptians, released, kolokotronis, from, captivity, but, he, too, was, unsuccessful, by, the, end, of, june, ibrahim, had, captured, the, city, of, argos, and, was, within, striking, distance, of, nafplion, the, city, was, saved, by, makriyannis, and, dimitrios, ypsilantis, who, successfully, defended, miloi, at, the, outskirts, of, nafplion, making, the, mills, outside, the, town, a, fortress, causing, damage, to, ibrahim, s, far, superior, forces, who, were, unable, to, take, the, position, and, eventually, left, for, tripolitsa, makriyannis, was, wounded, and, was, taken, aboard, by, europeans, who, were, overseeing, the, battle, among, them, was, de, rigny, who, had, an, argument, with, makriyannis, and, advised, him, to, quit, his, weak, position, but, makriyannis, ignored, him, commodore, gawen, hamilton, of, the, royal, navy, placed, his, ships, in, a, position, which, looked, like, he, would, assist, in, the, defence, of, the, city, at, the, same, time, the, turkish, armies, in, central, greece, were, besieging, the, city, of, missolonghi, for, the, third, time, the, siege, had, begun, on, 15, april, 1825, the, day, on, which, navarino, had, fallen, to, ibrahim, in, early, autumn, the, greek, navy, under, the, command, of, miaoulis, forced, the, turkish, fleet, in, the, gulf, of, corinth, to, retreat, after, attacking, it, with, fire, ships, the, turks, were, joined, by, ibrahim, in, mid, winter, but, his, army, had, no, more, luck, in, penetrating, missolonghi, s, defences, in, the, spring, of, 1826, ibrahim, managed, to, capture, the, marshes, around, the, city, although, not, without, heavy, losses, he, thus, cut, the, greeks, off, from, the, sea, and, blocked, off, their, supply, route, although, the, egyptians, and, the, turks, offered, them, terms, to, stop, the, attacks, the, greeks, refused, and, continued, to, fight, on, 22, april, the, greeks, decided, to, sail, from, the, city, during, the, night, with, 3, 000, men, to, cut, a, path, through, the, egyptian, lines, and, allow, 6, 000, women, children, and, non, combatants, to, follow, however, a, bulgarian, deserter, informed, ibrahim, of, the, greeks, intention, and, he, had, his, entire, army, deployed, only, 1, 800, greeks, managed, to, cut, their, way, through, the, egyptian, lines, between, 3, 000, and, 4, 000, women, and, children, were, enslaved, and, many, of, the, people, who, remained, behind, decided, to, blow, themselves, up, with, gunpowder, rather, than, be, enslaved, the, news, that, the, third, siege, of, missolonghi, had, ended, in, an, ottoman, victory, sparked, horror, all, over, greece, at, the, national, assembly, kolokotronis, was, giving, a, speech, when, the, news, of, missolonghi, s, fall, reached, him, leaving, him, to, remember, the, news, came, to, us, that, missolonghi, was, lost, we, were, all, plunged, into, great, grief, for, half, an, hour, there, was, so, complete, a, silence, that, no, one, would, have, thought, there, was, a, living, soul, present, each, of, us, was, revolving, in, his, mind, how, great, was, our, misfortune, the, american, philhellene, samuel, gridley, howe, serving, as, a, doctor, with, the, greeks, wrote, back, to, america, i, write, you, with, an, almost, breaking, heart, missolonghi, has, fallen, which, he, called, damning, proof, of, the, selfish, indifference, of, the, christian, world, you, may, talk, to, me, of, national, policy, and, the, necessity, of, neutrality, but, i, say, a, curse, upon, such, a, policy, the, news, of, missolonghi, s, fall, had, a, huge, impact, on, the, rest, of, europe, sparking, a, vast, outpouring, of, songs, poems, essays, sermons, and, plays, in, britain, france, germany, and, switzerland, with, the, recurring, image, of, missolonghi, s, fall, being, the, murder, of, a, sweet, and, innocent, young, greek, woman, at, the, hands, of, the, turks, as, a, symbol, of, the, unwillingness, of, the, christian, powers, of, the, world, to, do, anything, for, the, greeks, in, may, 1826, hastings, arrived, in, greece, with, a, british, built, steamship, the, karteria, perseverance, which, astonished, the, greeks, to, see, a, ship, powered, by, steam, and, did, not, move, either, via, sail, or, oars, the, karteria, suffered, from, constant, engine, breakdowns, but, hastings, was, able, to, use, the, ship, successfully, twice, over, the, course, of, the, next, two, years, at, volos, and, in, the, gulf, of, corinth, ibrahim, sent, an, envoy, to, the, maniots, demanding, that, they, surrender, or, else, he, would, ravage, their, land, as, he, had, done, to, the, rest, of, the, peloponnese, instead, of, surrendering, the, maniots, simply, replied, from, the, few, greeks, of, mani, and, the, rest, of, the, greeks, who, live, there, to, ibrahim, pasha, we, received, your, letter, in, which, you, try, to, frighten, us, saying, that, if, we, don, t, surrender, you, ll, kill, the, maniots, and, plunder, mani, that, s, why, we, are, waiting, for, you, and, your, army, we, the, inhabitants, of, mani, sign, and, wait, for, you, ibrahim, tried, to, enter, mani, from, the, north, east, near, almiro, on, 21, june, 1826, but, he, was, forced, to, stop, at, the, fortifications, at, vergas, in, northern, mani, his, army, of, 7, 000, men, was, held, off, by, an, army, of, 2, 000, maniots, and, 500, refugees, from, other, parts, of, greece, until, kolokotronis, attacked, the, egyptians, from, the, rear, and, forced, them, to, retreat, the, maniots, pursued, the, egyptians, all, the, way, to, kalamata, before, returning, to, vergas, simultaneously, ibrahim, sent, his, fleet, further, down, the, maniot, coast, in, order, to, outflank, the, greek, defenders, and, attack, them, from, the, rear, however, when, his, force, landed, at, pyrgos, dirou, they, were, confronted, by, a, group, of, maniot, women, and, repelled, ibrahim, again, attempted, to, enter, mani, from, central, laconia, but, again, the, maniots, defeated, the, turkish, and, egyptian, forces, at, polytsaravo, the, maniot, victory, dealt, the, death, blow, to, ibrahim, s, hope, of, occupying, mani, the, losses, ibrahim, pasha, had, taken, at, missolonghi, had, greatly, reduced, his, army, and, he, spent, the, rest, of, 1826, chasing, the, greek, guerillas, up, and, down, the, mountains, in, late, june, 1826, reshid, pasha, had, arrived, outside, of, athens, and, laid, siege, to, the, city, marking, the, beginning, of, the, siege, of, the, acropolis, by, the, middle, of, august, only, the, acropolis, still, held, out, under, yannis, gouras, to, break, the, siege, an, attack, was, launched, on, reshid, pasha, on, 18, august, 1826, led, by, the, guerrilla, leader, georgios, karaiskakis, and, the, french, philhellene, colonel, charles, nicolas, fabvier, but, were, driven, off, with, the, loss, of, some, 300, dead, on, 13, october, 1826, gouras, was, killed, by, an, ottoman, sniper, and, a, week, later, yannis, makriyannis, was, wounded, three, times, in, a, single, day, in, december, febvier, was, able, to, infiltrate, a, force, of, some, 500, men, into, the, akropolis, bringing, in, much, needed, supplies, of, gunpowder, through, he, was, much, offended, when, the, garrison, started, firing, to, wake, up, the, turks, trapping, him, and, his, men, in, the, summer, of, 1826, the, greek, government, gave, command, of, its, army, to, the, british, general, sir, richard, church, the, british, historian, george, finlay, wrote, church, was, of, a, small, well, made, active, frame, and, of, a, healthy, constitution, his, manner, was, agreeable, and, easy, with, the, polish, of, a, great, social, experience, and, the, goodness, of, his, disposition, was, admitted, by, his, enemies, but, the, strength, of, his, mind, was, not, the, quality, of, which, his, friends, boasted, both, church, and, the, greeks, misunderstood, one, another, the, greeks, expected, church, to, prove, a, wellington, with, a, military, chest, well, supplied, from, the, british, treasury, church, expected, the, irregulars, of, greece, to, execute, his, strategy, like, regiments, of, guards, church, landed, in, greece, in, march, 1827, and, was, welcomed, by, his, old, friend, kolokotronis, a, week, later, lord, cochrane, arrived, to, take, command, of, the, greek, navy, and, refused, to, leave, his, yacht, until, the, greeks, agreed, to, form, a, united, government, on, 31, march, 1827, the, trizina, assembly, began, its, work, drafting, a, new, constitution, and, offered, the, presidency, of, greece, to, the, former, russian, foreign, minister, count, ioannis, kapodistrias, in, the, meantime, the, siege, of, athens, continued, on, 5, february, 1827, a, force, of, 2, 300, greeks, under, the, command, of, colonel, thomas, gordon, landed, at, piraeus, and, laid, siege, to, the, monastery, of, ayios, spiridhon, held, by, turkish, and, albanian, troops, in, april, 1827, church, and, cochrane, arrived, at, athens, and, immediately, clashed, over, strategy, when, the, ottoman, garrison, at, ayios, spiridhon, surrendered, they, were, promised, safe, conduct, but, as, they, were, marching, out, a, shot, went, off, and, most, of, the, ottoman, soldiers, were, killed, cochrane, insisted, on, a, bold, but, risky, plan, to, stage, a, night, attack, across, the, open, plains, to, break, the, siege, an, operation, which, launched, on, 5, may, 1827, ended, in, disaster, as, the, greek, forces, got, lost, and, scattered, as, the, captains, quarrelled, with, one, another, this, led, to, a, devastating, ottoman, cavalry, charge, in, the, morning, with, ottomans, hunting, the, scattered, greek, forces, almost, at, leisure, on, 5, june, 1827, the, acropolis, surrendered, in, the, last, ottoman, victory, of, the, war, kapodistrias, arrived, in, greece, to, become, the, governor, on, 28, january, 1828, the, first, task, of, greece, s, new, leader, was, to, create, a, state, and, a, civil, society, which, the, workaholic, kapodistrias, toiled, at, mightily, working, from, 5, am, until, 10, pm, every, night, kapodistrias, alienated, many, with, his, haughty, high, handed, manner, and, his, open, contempt, for, most, of, the, greek, elite, but, he, attracted, support, from, several, of, the, captains, such, as, theodoros, kolokotronis, and, yannis, makriyannis, who, provided, the, necessary, military, force, to, back, up, kapodistrias, s, decisions, as, a, former, russian, foreign, minister, kapodistrias, was, well, connected, to, the, european, elite, and, he, attempted, to, use, his, connections, to, secure, loans, for, the, new, greek, state, and, to, achieve, the, most, favorable, borders, for, greece, which, was, being, debated, by, russian, french, and, british, diplomats, when, the, news, of, the, greek, revolution, was, first, received, the, reaction, of, the, european, powers, was, uniformly, hostile, they, recognized, the, degeneration, of, the, ottoman, empire, but, they, did, not, know, how, to, handle, this, situation, a, problem, known, as, the, eastern, question, afraid, of, the, complications, the, partition, of, the, empire, might, raise, the, british, foreign, minister, viscount, castlereagh, austrian, foreign, minister, prince, metternich, and, the, tsar, of, russia, alexander, i, shared, the, same, view, concerning, the, necessity, of, preserving, the, status, quo, and, the, peace, of, europe, they, also, pleaded, that, they, maintain, the, concert, of, europe, metternich, also, tried, to, undermine, the, russian, foreign, minister, ioannis, kapodistrias, who, was, of, greek, origin, kapodistrias, demanded, that, alexander, declare, war, on, the, ottomans, in, order, to, liberate, greece, and, increase, the, greatness, of, russia, metternich, persuaded, alexander, that, kapodistrias, was, in, league, with, the, italian, carbonari, an, italian, revolutionary, group, leading, alexander, to, disavow, him, as, a, result, of, the, russian, reaction, to, alexander, ypsilantis, kapodistrias, resigned, as, foreign, minister, and, moved, to, switzerland, nevertheless, alexander, s, position, was, ambivalent, since, he, regarded, himself, as, the, protector, of, the, orthodox, church, and, his, subjects, were, deeply, moved, by, the, hanging, of, the, patriarch, these, factors, explain, why, after, denouncing, the, greek, revolution, alexander, dispatched, an, ultimatum, to, constantinople, on, 27, july, 1821, after, the, greek, massacres, in, the, city, and, the, hanging, of, the, patriarch, however, the, danger, of, war, passed, temporarily, after, metternich, and, castlereagh, persuaded, the, sultan, to, make, some, concessions, to, the, tsar, on, 14, december, 1822, the, holy, alliance, denounced, the, greek, revolution, considering, it, audacious, in, august, 1822, george, canning, was, appointed, by, the, british, government, as, foreign, secretary, succeeding, castlereagh, canning, was, influenced, by, the, mounting, popular, agitation, against, the, ottomans, and, believed, that, a, settlement, could, no, longer, be, postponed, he, also, feared, that, russia, might, undertake, unilateral, action, against, the, ottoman, empire, in, march, 1823, canning, declared, that, when, a, whole, nation, revolts, against, its, conqueror, the, nation, cannot, be, considered, as, piratical, but, as, a, nation, in, a, state, of, war, in, february, 1823, he, notified, the, ottoman, empire, that, britain, would, maintain, friendly, relations, with, the, turks, only, under, the, condition, that, the, latter, respected, the, christian, subjects, of, the, empire, the, commissioner, of, the, ionian, islands, which, were, a, british, colony, was, ordered, to, consider, the, greeks, in, a, state, of, war, and, give, them, the, right, to, cut, off, certain, areas, from, which, the, turks, could, get, provisions, these, measures, led, to, the, increase, of, british, influence, this, influence, was, reinforced, by, the, issuing, of, two, loans, that, the, greeks, managed, to, conclude, with, british, fund, holders, in, 1824, and, 1825, these, loans, which, in, effect, made, the, city, of, london, the, financier, of, the, revolution, inspired, the, creation, of, the, british, political, party, in, greece, whose, opinion, was, that, the, revolution, could, only, end, in, success, with, the, help, of, britain, at, the, same, time, parties, affiliated, to, russia, and, france, made, their, appearance, these, parties, would, later, strive, for, power, during, king, otto, s, reign, when, tsar, nicholas, i, succeeded, alexander, in, december, 1825, canning, decided, to, act, immediately, he, sent, the, duke, of, wellington, to, russia, and, the, outcome, was, the, protocol, of, st, petersburg, of, 4, april, 1826, according, to, the, protocol, the, two, powers, agreed, to, mediate, between, the, ottomans, and, the, greeks, on, the, basis, of, complete, autonomy, of, greece, under, turkish, sovereignty, the, anglo, russian, protocol, that, wellington, negotiated, with, nicholas, in, st, petersburg, attracted, much, scorn, from, metternich, who, was, consistently, the, most, pro, ottoman, and, anti, greek, european, statesmen, metternich, dismissively, wrote, if, the, irish, were, to, revolt, against, the, british, crown, and, the, king, of, france, were, to, offer, to, mediate, leading, him, to, ask, is, england, then, ready, to, regard, as, a, power, equal, to, rights, to, that, of, the, king, the, first, irish, club, which, declares, itself, the, insurgent, government, of, ireland, to, regard, as, justified, the, french, power, which, would, accept, the, office, of, mediator, by, reason, of, the, sole, fact, that, the, invitation, had, been, addressed, to, it, by, the, irish, government, whither, does, this, absurdity, not, lead, us, prussia, whose, king, frederich, wilhelm, was, close, to, metternich, chose, to, follow, the, austrian, lead, before, he, met, with, wellington, the, tsar, had, already, sent, an, ultimatum, to, the, porte, demanding, that, the, principalities, be, evacuated, immediately, and, that, plenipotentiaries, be, sent, to, russia, to, settle, outstanding, issues, the, sultan, agreed, to, send, the, plenipotentiaries, and, on, 7, october, 1826, signed, the, akkerman, convention, in, which, russian, demands, concerning, serbia, and, the, principalities, were, accepted, the, greeks, formally, applied, for, the, mediation, provided, in, the, petersburg, protocol, while, the, turks, and, the, egyptians, showed, no, willingness, to, stop, fighting, france, which, initially, backed, its, client, muhammad, ali, the, great, with, weapons, and, officers, to, train, his, army, changed, its, stance, partly, because, of, the, pro, greek, feelings, of, the, french, people, and, partly, because, king, charles, x, saw, the, offer, to, impose, mediation, as, a, way, of, assuring, french, influence, in, greece, since, britain, and, russia, were, going, ahead, with, their, plans, to, impose, mediation, with, or, without, france, if, the, french, declined, the, offer, to, impose, mediation, greece, would, be, in, the, anglo, russian, sphere, of, influence, while, if, the, french, did, take, part, then, greece, would, also, be, in, the, french, sphere, of, influence, canning, therefore, prepared, for, action, by, negotiating, the, treaty, of, london, 6, july, 1827, with, france, and, russia, this, provided, that, the, allies, should, again, offer, negotiations, and, if, the, sultan, rejected, it, they, would, exert, all, the, means, which, circumstances, would, allow, to, force, the, cessation, of, hostilities, meanwhile, news, reached, greece, in, late, july, 1827, that, muhammad, ali, s, new, fleet, was, completed, in, alexandria, and, sailing, towards, navarino, to, join, the, rest, of, the, egyptian, turkish, fleet, the, aim, of, this, fleet, was, to, attack, hydra, and, knock, the, island, s, fleet, out, of, the, war, on, 29, august, the, porte, formally, rejected, the, treaty, of, london, s, stipulations, and, subsequently, the, commanders, in, chief, of, the, british, and, french, mediterranean, fleets, admiral, edward, codrington, and, admiral, henri, de, rigny, sailed, into, the, gulf, of, argos, and, requested, to, meet, with, greek, representatives, on, board, hms, asia, after, the, greek, delegation, led, by, mavrocordatos, accepted, the, terms, of, the, treaty, the, allies, prepared, to, insist, upon, the, armistice, and, their, fleets, were, instructed, to, intercept, supplies, destined, for, ibrahim, s, forces, when, muhammad, ali, s, fleet, which, had, been, warned, by, the, british, and, french, to, stay, away, from, greece, left, alexandria, and, joined, other, ottoman, egyptian, units, at, navarino, on, 8, september, codrington, arrived, with, his, squadron, off, navarino, on, 12, september, on, 13, october, codrington, was, joined, off, navarino, by, his, allied, support, a, french, squadron, under, de, rigny, and, a, russian, squadron, under, login, geiden, upon, their, arrival, at, navarino, codgrinton, and, de, rigny, tried, to, negotiate, with, ibrahim, but, ibrahim, insisted, that, by, the, sultan, s, order, he, must, destroy, hydra, codrington, responded, by, saying, that, if, ibrahim, s, fleets, attempted, to, go, anywhere, but, home, he, would, have, to, destroy, them, ibrahim, agreed, to, write, to, the, sultan, to, see, if, he, would, change, his, orders, but, he, also, complained, about, the, greeks, being, able, to, continue, their, attacks, codrington, promised, that, he, would, stop, the, greeks, and, philhellenes, from, attacking, the, turks, and, egyptians, after, doing, this, he, disbanded, most, of, his, fleet, which, returned, to, malta, while, the, french, went, to, the, aegean, however, when, frank, hastings, a, philhellene, destroyed, a, turkish, naval, squadron, during, a, raid, off, itea, ibrahim, sent, a, detachment, of, his, fleet, out, of, navarino, in, order, to, defeat, hastings, codrington, had, not, heard, of, hastings, s, actions, and, thought, that, ibrahim, was, breaking, his, agreement, codrington, intercepted, the, force, and, made, them, retreat, and, did, so, again, on, the, following, day, when, ibrahim, led, the, fleet, in, person, codrington, assembled, his, fleet, once, more, with, the, british, returning, from, malta, and, the, french, from, the, aegean, they, were, also, joined, by, the, russian, contingent, led, by, count, login, geiden, ibrahim, now, began, a, campaign, to, annihilate, the, greeks, of, the, peloponnese, as, he, thought, the, allies, had, reneged, on, their, agreement, on, 20, october, 1827, as, the, weather, got, worse, the, british, russian, and, french, fleets, entered, the, bay, of, navarino, in, peaceful, formation, to, shelter, themselves, and, to, make, sure, that, the, egyptian, turkish, fleet, did, not, slip, off, and, attack, hydra, when, a, british, frigate, sent, a, boat, to, request, the, egyptians, to, move, their, fire, ships, the, officer, on, board, was, shot, by, the, egyptians, the, frigate, responded, with, musket, fire, in, retaliation, and, an, egyptian, ship, fired, a, cannon, shot, at, the, french, flagship, the, sirene, which, returned, fire, a, full, engagement, was, begun, which, ended, in, a, complete, victory, for, the, allies, and, in, the, annihilation, of, the, egyptian, turkish, fleet, of, the, 89, egyptian, turkish, ships, that, took, part, in, the, battle, only, 14, made, it, back, to, alexandria, and, their, dead, amounted, to, over, 8, 000, the, allies, did, not, lose, a, ship, and, suffered, only, 181, deaths, the, porte, demanded, compensation, from, the, allies, for, the, ships, but, his, demand, was, refused, on, the, grounds, that, the, turks, had, acted, as, the, aggressors, the, three, countries, ambassadors, also, left, constantinople, in, britain, the, battle, received, a, mixed, reception, the, british, public, many, of, them, philhellenes, were, overjoyed, at, the, outcome, of, the, battle, which, all, but, confirmed, the, independence, of, greece, but, in, whitehall, senior, naval, and, diplomatic, echelons, were, appalled, by, the, outcome, of, his, campaign, it, was, considered, that, codrington, had, grossly, exceeded, his, instructions, by, provoking, a, showdown, with, the, ottoman, fleet, and, that, his, actions, had, gravely, compromised, the, ottoman, ability, to, resist, russian, encroachment, at, a, social, event, king, george, iv, was, reported, as, referring, to, the, battle, as, this, untoward, event, in, france, the, news, of, the, battle, was, greeted, with, great, enthusiasm, and, the, government, had, an, unexpected, surge, in, popularity, russia, formally, took, the, opportunity, to, declare, war, on, the, turks, april, 1828, in, october, 1828, the, greeks, regrouped, and, formed, a, new, government, under, kapodistrias, kapodistrias, took, advantage, of, the, russo, turkish, war, and, sent, troops, of, the, reorganised, hellenic, army, to, central, greece, they, advanced, to, seize, as, much, territory, as, possible, including, athens, and, thebes, before, the, western, powers, imposed, a, ceasefire, these, greek, victories, were, proved, decisive, for, the, including, of, more, territories, in, the, future, state, as, far, as, the, peloponnese, was, concerned, britain, and, russia, accepted, the, offer, of, france, to, send, an, army, to, expel, ibrahim, s, forces, nicolas, joseph, maison, who, was, given, command, of, a, french, expeditionary, corps, of, 15, 000, men, landed, on, 30, august, 1828, at, petalidi, and, helped, the, greeks, evacuate, the, peloponnese, from, all, the, hostile, troops, by, 30, october, maison, thus, implemented, the, convention, codrington, had, negotiated, and, signed, in, alexandria, with, muhammad, ali, which, provided, for, the, withdrawal, of, all, egyptian, troops, from, the, peloponnese, the, french, troops, whose, military, engineers, also, helped, rebuild, the, peloponnese, were, accompanied, by, seventeen, distinguished, scientists, of, the, scientific, expedition, of, morea, botany, zoology, geology, geography, archaeology, architecture, and, sculpture, whose, work, was, of, major, importance, for, the, building, of, the, new, independent, state, the, french, troops, definitely, left, greece, after, five, years, in, 1833, the, final, major, engagement, of, the, war, was, the, battle, of, petra, which, occurred, north, of, attica, greek, forces, under, demetrius, ypsilantis, for, the, first, time, trained, to, fight, as, a, regular, european, army, rather, than, as, guerrilla, bands, advanced, against, aslan, bey, s, forces, and, defeated, them, the, turks, surrendered, all, lands, from, livadeia, to, the, spercheios, river, in, exchange, for, safe, passage, out, of, central, greece, as, george, finlay, stresses, thus, prince, demetrios, ypsilantis, had, the, honor, of, terminating, the, war, which, his, brother, had, commenced, on, the, banks, of, the, pruth, in, september, 1828, the, conference, of, poros, opened, to, discuss, what, should, be, the, borders, of, greece, on, 21, december, 1828, the, ambassadors, of, britain, russia, and, france, met, on, the, island, of, poros, and, prepared, a, protocol, which, provided, for, the, creation, of, an, autonomous, state, ruled, by, a, monarch, whose, authority, should, be, confirmed, by, a, firman, of, the, sultan, the, proposed, borderline, ran, from, arta, to, volos, and, despite, kapodistrias, efforts, the, new, state, would, include, only, the, islands, of, the, cyclades, the, sporades, samos, and, maybe, crete, the, sublime, porte, which, had, rejected, the, call, for, an, armistice, in, 1827, now, rejected, the, conclusions, of, the, poros, conference, with, the, sultan, mahmud, ii, saying, he, would, never, grant, greece, independence, and, the, war, would, go, on, until, he, reconquered, all, of, greece, based, on, the, protocol, of, poros, the, london, conference, agreed, on, the, protocol, of, 22, march, 1829, which, accepted, most, of, the, ambassadors, proposals, but, drew, the, borders, farther, south, than, the, initial, proposal, and, did, not, include, samos, and, crete, in, the, new, state, under, pressure, from, russia, the, porte, finally, agreed, on, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, london, of, 6, july, 1827, and, of, the, protocol, of, 22, march, 1829, soon, afterward, britain, and, france, conceived, the, idea, of, an, independent, greek, state, trying, to, limit, the, influence, of, russia, on, the, new, state, russia, disliked, the, idea, but, could, not, reject, it, and, consequently, the, three, powers, finally, agreed, to, create, an, independent, greek, state, under, their, joint, protection, concluding, the, protocols, of, 3, february, 1830, by, one, of, the, protocols, the, greek, throne, was, initially, offered, to, leopold, prince, of, saxe, coburg, and, gotha, and, the, future, king, of, belgium, discouraged, by, the, gloomy, picture, painted, by, kapodistrias, and, unsatisfied, with, the, aspropotamos, zitouni, borderline, which, replaced, the, more, favorable, line, running, from, arta, to, volos, considered, by, the, great, powers, earlier, he, refused, negotiations, temporarily, stalled, after, kapodistrias, was, assassinated, in, 1831, in, nafplion, by, the, mavromichalis, clan, after, having, demanded, that, they, unconditionally, submit, to, his, authority, when, they, refused, kapodistrias, put, petrobey, in, jail, sparking, vows, of, vengeance, from, his, clan, the, withdrawal, of, leopold, as, a, candidate, for, the, throne, of, greece, and, the, july, revolution, in, france, further, delayed, the, final, settlement, of, the, new, kingdom, s, frontiers, until, a, new, government, was, formed, in, britain, lord, palmerston, who, took, over, as, british, foreign, secretary, agreed, to, the, arta, volos, borderline, however, the, secret, note, on, crete, which, the, bavarian, plenipotentiary, communicated, to, britain, france, and, russia, bore, no, fruit, in, may, 1832, palmerston, convened, the, london, conference, the, three, great, powers, britain, france, and, russia, offered, the, throne, to, the, bavarian, prince, otto, of, wittelsbach, meanwhile, the, fifth, national, assembly, at, nafplion, had, approved, the, choice, of, otto, and, passed, the, constitution, of, 1832, which, would, come, to, be, known, as, the, hegemonic, constitution, as, co, guarantors, of, the, monarchy, the, great, powers, also, agreed, to, guarantee, a, loan, of, 60, million, francs, to, the, new, king, empowering, their, ambassadors, in, the, ottoman, capital, to, secure, the, end, of, the, war, under, the, protocol, signed, on, 7, may, 1832, between, bavaria, and, the, protecting, powers, greece, was, defined, as, a, monarchical, and, independent, state, but, was, to, pay, an, indemnity, to, the, porte, the, protocol, outlined, the, way, in, which, the, regency, was, to, be, managed, until, otto, reached, his, majority, while, also, concluding, the, second, greek, loan, for, a, sum, of, 2, 4, million, on, 21, july, 1832, british, ambassador, to, the, sublime, porte, sir, stratford, canning, and, the, other, representatives, of, the, great, powers, signed, the, treaty, of, constantinople, which, defined, the, boundaries, of, the, new, greek, kingdom, at, the, arta, volos, line, the, borders, of, the, kingdom, were, reiterated, in, the, london, protocol, of, 30, august, 1832, also, signed, by, the, great, powers, which, ratified, the, terms, of, the, constantinople, arrangement, almost, as, soon, as, the, revolution, began, there, were, large, scale, massacres, of, civilians, by, both, greek, revolutionaries, and, ottoman, authorities, greek, revolutionaries, massacred, jews, muslims, and, christians, suspected, of, ottoman, sympathies, alike, mainly, in, the, peloponnese, and, attica, where, greek, forces, were, dominant, the, turks, massacred, greeks, identified, with, the, revolution, especially, in, anatolia, crete, constantinople, cyprus, macedonia, and, the, aegean, islands, they, also, massacred, unarmed, greeks, in, places, which, did, not, revolt, as, in, smyrna, and, in, constantinople, some, of, the, more, infamous, atrocities, include, the, chios, massacre, the, constantinople, massacre, the, destruction, of, psara, massacre, of, samothrace, 1821, kasos, massacre, naousa, massacre, third, siege, of, missolonghi, the, massacres, following, the, tripolitsa, massacre, and, the, navarino, massacre, there, is, debate, among, scholars, over, whether, the, massacres, committed, by, the, greeks, should, be, regarded, as, a, response, to, prior, events, such, as, the, massacre, of, the, greeks, of, tripoli, after, the, failed, orlov, revolt, of, 1770, and, the, destruction, of, the, sacred, band, or, as, separate, atrocities, which, started, simultaneously, with, the, outbreak, of, the, revolt, during, the, war, tens, of, thousands, of, greek, civilians, were, killed, left, to, die, or, taken, into, slavery, most, of, the, greeks, in, the, greek, quarter, of, constantinople, were, massacred, a, large, number, of, christian, clergymen, were, also, killed, including, the, ecumenical, patriarch, gregory, v, sometimes, marked, as, allies, of, the, turks, in, the, peloponnese, jewish, settlements, were, also, massacred, by, greek, revolutionaries, steve, bowman, argues, that, the, tragedy, may, have, been, more, a, side, effect, of, the, butchering, of, the, turks, of, tripolis, the, last, ottoman, stronghold, in, the, south, where, the, jews, had, taken, refuge, from, the, fighting, than, a, specific, action, against, jews, as, such, many, jews, around, greece, and, throughout, europe, were, supporters, of, the, greek, revolt, using, their, resources, to, loan, substantial, amounts, to, the, newly, formed, greek, government, in, turn, the, success, of, the, greek, revolution, was, to, stimulate, the, incipient, stirrings, of, jewish, nationalism, later, called, zionism, the, consequences, of, the, greek, revolution, were, somewhat, ambiguous, in, the, immediate, aftermath, an, independent, greek, state, had, been, established, but, britain, russia, and, france, still, had, significant, influence, in, greek, politics, selecting, an, imported, bavarian, prince, as, ruler, the, country, had, been, ravaged, by, ten, years, of, fighting, and, was, full, of, displaced, refugees, and, empty, turkish, estates, necessitating, a, series, of, land, reforms, over, several, decades, the, population, of, the, new, state, numbered, 800, 000, representing, less, than, one, third, of, the, 2, 5, million, greek, inhabitants, of, the, ottoman, empire, during, a, great, part, of, the, next, century, the, greek, state, sought, the, liberation, of, the, unredeemed, greeks, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, accordance, with, the, megali, idea, i, e, the, goal, of, uniting, all, greeks, in, one, country, as, a, people, the, greeks, no, longer, provided, the, princes, for, the, danubian, principalities, and, were, regarded, within, the, ottoman, empire, especially, by, the, muslim, population, as, traitors, phanariotes, who, had, until, then, held, high, office, within, the, ottoman, empire, were, thenceforth, regarded, as, suspect, and, lost, their, special, privileged, status, in, constantinople, and, the, rest, of, the, ottoman, empire, where, greek, banking, and, merchant, presence, had, been, dominant, armenians, mostly, replaced, greeks, in, banking, and, jewish, merchants, gained, importance, the, war, would, prove, a, seminal, event, in, the, history, of, the, ottoman, empire, despite, the, small, size, and, the, impoverishment, of, the, new, greek, state, for, the, first, time, a, christian, subject, people, had, achieved, independence, from, ottoman, rule, and, established, a, fully, independent, state, recognized, by, europe, whereas, previously, only, large, nations, such, as, the, prussians, or, austrians, had, been, judged, worthy, of, national, self, determination, by, the, great, powers, the, greek, revolt, legitimized, the, concept, of, small, nation, states, and, emboldened, nationalist, movements, among, other, subject, peoples, of, the, ottoman, empire, shortly, after, the, war, ended, the, people, of, the, russian, dependent, poland, encouraged, by, the, greek, victory, started, the, november, uprising, hoping, to, regain, their, independence, this, uprising, failed, however, and, polish, independence, would, not, be, restored, until, 1918, at, versailles, the, newly, established, greek, state, would, pursue, further, expansion, and, over, the, course, of, a, century, parts, of, macedonia, crete, parts, of, epirus, many, aegean, islands, the, ionian, islands, and, other, greek, speaking, territories, would, unite, with, the, new, greek, state, in, 1971, the, municipality, of, thessaloniki, commissioned, a, symphonic, work, for, the, 150th, anniversary, of, the, greek, revolution, nicolas, astrinidis, choral, symphony, 1821, was, premiered, on, 27, october, 1971, at, the, 6th, demetria, after, nearly, four, hundred, years, of, foreign, rule, greeks, often, used, music, and, poetry, as, a, means, of, empowerment, in, the, war, rigas, feraios, 1757, 1798, was, a, very, prominent, poet, and, intellectual, of, the, greek, independence, movement, many, of, his, poems, urged, the, people, of, greece, to, leave, the, cities, head, to, the, mountains, where, they, would, have, more, freedom, and, unite, to, gain, their, independence, dionysios, solomos, 1798, 1857, was, another, national, poet, inspired, by, the, greek, war, of, independence, solomos, wrote, the, hymn, to, liberty, now, the, national, anthem, in, 1823, two, years, after, the, greeks, started, the, war, against, the, ottoman, empire, the, poem, itself, is, 158, stanzas, but, officially, only, the, first, two, are, the, anthem, it, is, the, national, anthem, not, only, of, greece, but, also, of, cyprus, which, adopted, it, in, 1966, to, this, day, many, songs, are, sung, by, greeks, worldwide, on, 25, march, to, celebrate, their, liberation, and, showcase, their, respect, for, the, lives, that, were, lost, during, the, four, hundred, years, of, ottoman, rule, 21
