kusumawardhani, who, married, a, relative, prince, wikramawardhana, hayam, wuruk, also, had, a, son, from, his, previous, marriage, the, crown, prince, wirabhumi, who, also, claimed, the, throne, by, the, time, of, hayam, wuruk, s, death, majapahit, had, lost, its, grip, on, its, vassal, states, on, the, northern, coasts, of, sumatra, and, the, malay, peninsula, the, latter, which, according, to, chinese, sources, would, become, a, tributary, state, of, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, until, the, rise, of, malacca, sultanate, supported, by, the, ming, dynasty, in, the, 14th, century, a, malay, kingdom, of, singapura, was, established, and, it, promptly, attracted, a, majapahit, navy, that, regarded, it, as, tumasik, a, rebellious, colony, singapura, was, finally, sacked, by, majapahit, in, 1398, after, approximately, 1, month, long, siege, by, 300, jong, and, 200, 000, men, 69, the, last, king, parameswara, fled, to, the, west, coast, of, the, malay, peninsula, to, establish, the, melaka, sultanate, in, 1400, a, war, of, succession, called, the, regreg, war, is, thought, to, have, occurred, from, 1405, to, 1406, 18, the, war, was, fought, as, a, contest, of, succession, between, the, western, court, led, by, wikramawardhana, and, the, eastern, court, led, by, bhre, wirabhumi, wikramawardhana, was, victorious, wirabhumi, was, caught, and, decapitated, however, the, civil, war, drained, financial, resources, exhausted, the, kingdom, and, weakened, majapahit, s, grip, on, its, outer, vassals, and, colonies, during, the, reign, of, wikramawardhana, a, series, of, ming, armada, naval, expeditions, led, by, zheng, he, 241, 242, a, muslim, chinese, admiral, arrived, in, java, several, times, spanning, the, period, from, 1405, to, 1433, these, chinese, voyages, visited, numbers, of, ports, in, asia, as, far, as, africa, including, majapahit, ports, it, was, said, that, zheng, he, has, paid, a, visit, to, the, majapahit, court, in, java, these, massive, chinese, voyages, were, not, merely, a, naval, exploration, but, also, a, show, of, power, and, a, display, of, geopolitical, reach, the, chinese, ming, dynasty, had, recently, overthrown, the, mongol, led, yuan, dynasty, and, was, eager, to, establish, their, hegemony, in, the, world, which, changed, the, geopolitical, balance, in, asia, the, chinese, intervened, in, the, politics, of, the, southern, seas, by, supporting, thais, against, the, declining, khmer, empire, supporting, and, installing, allied, factions, in, india, sri, lanka, and, other, places, in, indian, ocean, coasts, however, perhaps, the, most, significant, chinese, intervention, was, its, support, for, the, newly, established, sultanate, of, malacca, as, a, rival, and, counter, weight, to, the, majapahit, influence, of, java, previously, majapahit, had, succeeded, in, asserting, its, influence, in, malacca, strait, by, containing, the, aspiration, of, malay, polities, in, sumatra, and, the, malay, peninsula, to, ever, reach, the, geopolitical, might, like, those, of, srivijaya, the, hindu, majapahit, was, the, most, powerful, maritime, power, in, southeast, asian, seas, that, time, and, were, opposed, to, chinese, expansion, into, their, sphere, of, influence, the, ming, s, support, for, malacca, and, the, spread, of, islam, propagated, by, both, malacca, and, zheng, he, s, treasure, fleet, has, weakened, majapahit, maritime, influence, in, sumatra, which, caused, the, northern, part, of, the, island, to, increasingly, converting, to, islam, and, gained, independence, from, majapahit, leaving, indragiri, jambi, and, palembang, remnants, of, the, old, srivijaya, the, only, suzerainty, under, majapahit, in, sumatra, bordering, pagaruyung, kingdom, on, the, west, and, independent, muslim, kingdoms, on, the, north, this, ming, dynasty, voyages, are, extremely, important, for, majapahit, historiography, since, zheng, he, s, translator, ma, huan, wrote, yingya, shenglan, a, detailed, description, of, majapahit, which, provides, valuable, insight, on, the, culture, customs, and, also, various, social, and, economic, aspects, of, java, during, majapahit, period, the, chinese, provided, systematic, support, to, malacca, and, its, sultan, made, at, least, one, trip, to, personally, pay, obeisance, to, the, ming, emperor, malacca, actively, encouraged, the, conversion, to, islam, in, the, region, while, the, ming, fleet, actively, established, chinese, malay, muslim, community, in, coastal, northern, java, thus, created, a, permanent, opposition, to, the, hindus, of, java, by, 1430, the, expeditions, had, established, muslim, chinese, arab, and, malay, communities, in, northern, ports, of, java, such, as, semarang, demak, tuban, and, ampel, thus, islam, began, to, gain, a, foothold, on, the, northern, coast, of, java, malacca, prospered, under, chinese, ming, protection, while, the, majapahit, were, steadily, pushed, back, wikramawardhana, ruled, until, 1429, and, was, succeeded, by, his, daughter, suhita, 242, who, ruled, from, 1429, to, 1447, she, was, the, second, child, of, wikramawardhana, by, a, concubine, who, was, the, daughter, of, wirabhumi, she, was, married, to, future, kelantan, king, iskandar, shah, or, kemas, jiwa, in, 1427, both, of, them, had, a, daughter, together, and, he, stayed, with, her, in, java, kelantan, was, ruled, by, his, brother, sultan, sadik, muhammad, shah, until, his, death, in, 1429, this, necessitated, kemas, jiwa, to, return, and, took, the, throne, as, iskandar, where, he, declared, kelantan, as, majapahit, ii, in, mahligai, although, pararaton, listed, her, husband, as, bhra, hyang, parameswara, ratnapangkaja, which, suggests, she, remarried, after, kemas, jiwa, returned, the, reign, of, suhita, was, the, second, time, majapahit, was, reigned, by, a, queen, regnant, after, her, great, grandmother, tribhuwana, wijayatunggadewi, her, reign, is, immortalized, in, javanese, legend, of, damarwulan, as, it, involves, a, maiden, queen, named, prabu, kenya, in, the, story, and, during, suhita, s, reign, there, was, a, war, with, blambangan, as, stated, in, the, legend, in, 1447, suhita, died, and, was, succeeded, by, kertawijaya, her, brother, 242, he, ruled, until, 1451, after, kertawijaya, died, bhre, pamotan, became, a, king, with, formal, name, rajasawardhana, he, died, in, 1453, a, three, year, kingless, period, was, possibly, the, result, of, a, succession, crisis, girisawardhana, son, of, kertawijaya, came, to, power, in, 1456, he, died, in, 1466, and, was, succeeded, by, singhawikramawardhana, in, 1468, prince, kertabhumi, rebelled, against, singhawikramawardhana, promoting, himself, as, the, king, of, majapahit, deposed, singhawikramawardhana, retreated, upstream, of, brantas, river, moved, the, kingdom, s, capital, further, inland, to, daha, the, former, capital, of, kediri, kingdom, effectively, splitting, majapahit, under, bhre, kertabumi, in, trowulan, and, singhawikramawardhana, in, daha, singhawikramawardhana, continued, his, rule, until, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, girindrawardhana, ranawijaya, in, 1474, and, in, between, this, period, of, the, dividing, court, of, majapahit, the, kingdom, found, itself, unable, to, control, its, western, part, of, the, already, crumbling, empire, the, rising, power, of, the, sultanate, of, malacca, began, to, gain, effective, control, of, the, malacca, strait, in, the, mid, 15th, century, and, expanding, its, influence, to, sumatra, and, amidst, these, events, indragiri, and, siantan, according, to, malay, annals, were, given, to, malacca, as, a, dowry, for, the, marriage, of, a, majapahit, princess, and, the, sultan, of, malacca, further, weakening, majapahit, s, influence, on, the, western, part, of, the, archipelago, kertabhumi, managed, to, stabilize, this, situation, by, allying, with, muslim, merchants, giving, them, trading, rights, on, the, north, coast, of, java, with, demak, as, its, centre, and, in, return, asked, for, their, loyalty, to, majapahit, this, policy, boosted, the, majapahit, treasury, and, power, but, weakened, hindu, buddhism, as, its, main, religion, because, islamic, proselytizing, spread, faster, especially, in, javanese, coastal, principalities, hindu, buddhist, followers, grievances, later, paved, the, way, for, ranawijaya, to, defeat, kertabumi, dates, for, the, end, of, the, majapahit, empire, range, from, 1478, traditionally, described, in, sinengkalan, or, chandrasengkala, chronogram, sirna, ilang, kertaning, bhumi, that, is, correspond, to, 1400, saka, to, 1527, 36, the, year, 1478, was, the, year, of, sudarma, wisuta, war, when, ranawijaya, s, army, under, general, udara, who, later, became, vice, regent, breached, trowulan, defences, and, killed, kertabumi, in, his, palace, but, not, the, actual, fall, of, majapahit, itself, as, a, whole, demak, sent, reinforcements, under, sunan, ngudung, who, later, died, in, battle, and, was, replaced, by, sunan, kudus, but, they, came, too, late, to, save, kertabumi, although, they, managed, to, repel, the, ranawijaya, army, this, event, is, mentioned, in, trailokyapuri, jiyu, and, petak, inscription, where, ranawijaya, claimed, that, he, already, defeated, kertabhumi, and, reunited, majapahit, as, one, kingdom, ranawijaya, ruled, from, 1474, to, 1498, with, the, formal, name, girindrawardhana, with, udara, as, his, vice, regent, this, event, led, to, the, war, between, the, sultanate, of, demak, and, daha, since, demak, rulers, were, descendants, of, kertabhumi, during, this, period, demak, being, the, dominant, ruler, of, the, javanese, coastal, lands, and, java, as, a, whole, seized, the, region, of, jambi, and, palembang, in, sumatra, from, majapahit, 154, 155, in, 1498, there, was, a, turning, point, when, girindrawardhana, was, deposed, by, his, vice, regent, udara, after, this, coup, the, war, between, demak, and, majapahit, receded, since, raden, patah, sultan, of, demak, left, majapahit, alone, like, his, father, had, done, before, some, source, said, udara, agreed, to, become, a, vassal, of, demak, even, marrying, raden, patah, s, youngest, daughter, meanwhile, in, the, west, malacca, was, captured, by, portuguese, in, 1511, the, delicate, balance, between, demak, and, majapahit, ended, when, udara, seeing, an, opportunity, to, eliminate, demak, asked, for, portuguese, help, in, malacca, forcing, demak, to, attack, both, malacca, and, majapahit, under, adipati, yunus, to, end, this, alliance, with, the, fall, of, majapahit, crushed, by, demak, in, 1527, 54, 55, the, muslim, emerging, forces, finally, defeated, the, remnants, of, the, majapahit, kingdom, in, the, early, 16th, century, and, with, the, fall, of, majapahit, a, large, number, of, courtiers, artisans, priests, and, members, of, the, royalty, moved, east, to, the, island, of, bali, the, refugees, fled, to, the, east, to, avoid, demak, retribution, for, their, support, for, ranawijaya, against, kertabhumi, demak, came, under, the, leadership, of, raden, later, crowned, as, sultan, patah, who, was, acknowledged, as, the, legitimate, successor, of, majapahit, according, to, babad, tanah, jawi, and, demak, tradition, the, source, of, patah, s, legitimacy, was, because, their, first, sultan, raden, patah, was, the, son, of, majapahit, king, brawijaya, v, with, a, chinese, concubine, another, argument, supports, demak, as, the, successor, of, majapahit, the, rising, demak, sultanate, was, easily, accepted, as, the, nominal, regional, ruler, as, demak, was, the, former, majapahit, vassal, and, located, near, the, former, majapahit, realm, in, eastern, java, demak, established, itself, as, the, regional, power, and, the, first, islamic, sultanate, in, java, after, the, fall, of, majapahit, the, hindu, kingdoms, in, java, only, remained, in, pasuruan, panarukan,

shaped, the, javanese, civilisation, religion, and, spiritualism, since, the, earlier, era, from, the, 9th, century, mataram, kingdom, kahuripan, kadiri, to, singhasari, kingdom, it, seems, that, both, hinduism, and, buddhism, are, widely, practised, by, majapahit, subjects, nevertheless, native, javanese, shamanism, possibly, still, exist, and, practised, in, peripheral, rural, regions, the, monarch, and, most, of, the, royal, family, adhered, to, hinduism, with, certain, emphasis, on, the, cult, of, their, own, preferred, main, deity, either, shiva, vishnu, durga, or, other, deities,

buddhists, gayatri, later, posthumously, portrayed, as, prajnaparamita, the, state, religion, however, was, possibly, the, siwa, buddha, the, javanese, syncretism, of, shaivism, and, buddhism, which, emphasise, the, similarity, between, shiva, and, buddha, which, both, described, as, ascetics, and, spiritual, teacher, the, spiritual, circumstances, of, majapahit, seems, to, promote, the, harmony, between, the, adherents, of, shiva, and, buddha, as, demonstrated, in, the, manuscript, sutasoma, written, in, the, 14th, century, by, mpu, tantular, which, promotes, the, religious, tolerance, between, the, hinduism, and, buddhism, specifically, promote, the, syncretic, shiva, buddha, doctrine, during, the, majapahit, period, religious, teaching, played, an, important, role, in, the,

and, composed, by, rakawis, poets, to, worship, the, king, of, the, gods, whose, incarnation, the, king, represented, nagarakretagama, composed, by, prapanca, in, 1365, is, a, vital, source, of, the, premier, historical, account, of, majapahit, historiography, while, sutasoma, is, an, important, literature, for, modern, indonesian, nationhood, since, the, national, motto, bhinneka, tunggal, ika,

letters, there, is, no, paper, or, pen, they, use, chiao, chang, kajang, or, palm, leaf, lontar, written, by, scraping, it, with, a, sharp, knife, they, also, have, a, developed, language, system, and, grammar, the, pala, school, of, art, of, the, indian, pala, empire, influenced, the, art, and, architecture, of, majapahit, majapahit, art, was, the, continuation, of, east, javanese, art, style, and, aesthetically, developed, since, the, 11th, century, during, the, kediri, and, singhasari, period, unlike, the, earlier, naturalistic, relaxed, and, flowing, figures, of, classical, central, java, style, sailendra, art, c, 8th, to, 10th, century, this, east, javanese, style, demonstrates, a, stiffer, pose, stylised, and, rendered, in, wayang, like, figures, such, as, those, carved, on, east, javanese, temple, s, bas, reliefs, the, bas, reliefs, were, projected, rather, flat, from, the, background, this, style, was, later, preserved, in, balinese, art, especially, in, its, kamasan, style, classical, paintings, and, balinese, wayang, the, statues, of, hindu, gods, and, buddhist, deities, in, majapahit, art, were, also, the, continuations, of, its, previous, singhasari, art, the, statues, of, east, javanese, period, tends, to, be, a, stiffer, and, frontal, formal, pose, compared, to, the, statues, of, central, javanese, art, c, 9th, century, that, are, more, indianized, style, relaxed, in, tribhanga, pose, the, stiffer, pose, of, majapahit, gods, statues, is, probably, in, accordance, with, the, statue, s, function, as, the, deified, portrayal, self, of, the, dead, majapahit, monarch, the, carving, however, is, richly, decorated, especially, with, a, fine, floral, carving, of, lotus, plants, carved, on, the, stela, behind, the, statue, examples, of, majapahit, statues, are, the, harihara, statue, from, simping, temple, believed, to, be, the, deified, portrayal, of, king, kertarajasa, the, statue, of, parwati, believed, to, be, the, portrayal, of, queen,

architecture, the, majapahit, terracotta, art, also, flourished, in, this, period, significant, numbers, of, terracotta, artefacts, were, discovered, in, trowulan, the, artefacts, range, from, human, and, animal, figurines, jars, vessels, water, containers, piggy, banks, bas, reliefs, architectural, ornaments, roof, pinnacles, floor, tiles, to, pipes, and, roof, tiles, one, of, the, most, interesting, findings, is, the, majapahit, piggy, bank, several, boar, shaped, piggy, banks, have, been, discovered, in, trowulan, it, is, probably, the, origin, of, javanese, indonesian, word, to, refer, for, saving, or, money, container, the, word, celengan, in, javanese, and, indonesian, means, both, savings, and, piggy, bank, it, was, derived, from, the, word, celeng, which, means, wild, boar, the, suffix, an, was, added, to, denote, its, likeness, one, important, specimen, is, stored, in, the, national, museum, of, indonesia, it, has, been, reconstructed, since, this, large, piggy, bank, has, been, found, broken, to, pieces, terracotta, money, boxes, also, have, been, found, in, different, shapes, such, as, tubular, or, boxes, with, slits, to, slip, coins, another, important, terracotta, artefact, is, the, head, figurine, of, a, man, popularly, thought, to, be, the, depiction, of, gajah, mada, although, it, is, not, certain, about, who, was, depicted, in, these, figurines, in, his, book, yingya, shenglan, ma, huan, also, describes, the, majapahit, cities, most, of, them, do, not, have, walls, surrounding, the, city, or, the, suburbs, he, describes, the, king, s, palace, in, majapahit, the, king, s, residence, is, surrounded, with, thick, red, brick, walls, more, than, three, chang, high, about, 30, feet, 7, inches, or, 9, 32, metres, with, length, of, more, than, 200, paces, 340, yards, or, 310, metres, and, on, the, wall, there, are, two, layers, of, gates, the, palace, is, very, well, guarded, and, clean, the, king, s, palace, was, a, two, storey, building, each, of, them, 3, or, 4, chang, high, 9, 32, 12, 42, metres, or, 30, 6, 40, 7, feet, it, had, wooden, plank, floors, and, exposed, mats, made, from, rattan, or, reeds, presumably, palm, leaves, where, people, sat, cross, legged, the, roof, was, made, of, hardwood, shingles, javanese, sirap, laid, as, tiles, this, description, of, the, palace, is, very, different, than, that, of, odoric, of, pordenone, who, visited, majapahit, in, the, previous, century, during, the, reign, of, jayanegara, 1309, 1328, 332, the, reason, of, this, was, because, ma, huan, likely, stayed, at, a, special, area, reserved, for, envoys, which, was, still, 1, 5, days, journey, away, from, the, real, majapahit, palace, odoric, described, the, palace, in, more, detail, the, palace, was, described, as, being, richer, and, finer, than, any, existing, palace, at, that, time, in, the, world, it, had, grand, broad, and, lofty, staircases, which, the, steps, alternately, made, of, gold, and, silver, the, pavement, of, the, palace, was, made, alternately, with, one, tile, of, gold, and, the, other, of, silver, and, the, inside, wall, plated, all, over, with, gold, with, knight, sculptures, of, gold, ornamented, with, precious, stones, the, ceiling, of, majapahit, palace, was, made, of, pure, gold, 87, according, to, ma, huan, the, houses, of, commoners, had, thatched, roofs, nipa, palm, leaves, every, family, has, a, storage, shed, made, of, bricks, about, 3, or, 4, chi, 48, 9, inches, or, 124, centimetres, above, the, ground, where, they, kept, the, family, property, and, they, lived, on, top, of, this, building, to, sit, and, sleep, not, every, house, in, java, looked, like, this, according, to, the, history, of, the, song, dynasty, houses, in, java, are, grand, and, handsome, they, are, decorated, with, gold, and, jade, the, chronicle, also, noted, that, when, chinese, merchants, arrive, there, they, are, received, as, guests, in, a, public, building, 16, this, indicates, that, ma, huan, had, not, yet, arrived, at, the, center, of, majapahit, capital, and, was, only, observing, the, outskirts, the, majapahit, temple, architecture, follows, the, east, javanese, styles, in, contrast, to, earlier, central, javanese, style, this, east, javanese, temple, style, is, also, dated, back, from, kediri, period, c, 11th, century, the, shapes, of, majapahit, temples, tend, to, be, slender, and, tall, with, a, roof, constructed, from, multiple, parts, of, stepped, sections, formed, a, combined, roof, structure, curved, upward, smoothly, creating, the, perspective, illusion, that, the, temple, is, perceived, taller, than, its, actual, height, the, pinnacle, of, the, temples, are, usually, cube, mostly, hindu, temples, sometimes, dagoba, cylindrical, structures, buddhist, temples, although, some, of, the, temples, dated, from, majapahit, period, used, andesite, or, sandstone, the, red, bricks, is, also, a, popular, construction, material, although, brick, had, been, used, in, the, candi, of, indonesia, s, classical, age, it, was, majapahit, architects, of, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, who, mastered, it, making, use, of, a, vine, sap, and, palm, sugar, mortar, their, temples, had, a, strong, geometric, quality, the, example, of, majapahit, temples, are, brahu, temple, in, trowulan, pari, in, sidoarjo, jabung, in, probolinggo, and, surawana, temple, near, kediri, jabung, temple, was, mentioned, in, nagarakretagama, as, bajrajinaparamitapura, despite, some, parts, of, its, roof, and, pinnacles, are, now, missing, it, is, one, of, the, most, well, preserved, majapahit, temple, architecture, another, example, includes, gunung, gangsir, temple, near, pasuruan, some, of, the, temples, are, dated, from, the, earlier, period, but, renovated, and, expanded, during, majapahit, era, such, as, penataran, the, largest, temple, in, east, java, dated, back, to, kediri, era, this, temple, was, identified, in, nagarakretagama, as, palah, temple, and, reported, being, visited, by, king, hayam, wuruk, during, his, royal, tour, across, east, java, another, notable, temple, of, eastern, javanese, style, is, jawi, temple, in, pandaan, also, visited, by, king, hayam, wuruk, the, temple, was, mentioned, in, nagarakretagama, as, jajawa, and, was, dedicated, as, a, mortuary, temple, for, his, great, grandfather, king, kertanegara, of, singhasari, some, of, the, typical, architectural, styles, are, believed, to, be, developed, during, majapahit, era, such, as, tall, and, slender, roofed, red, brick, gate, commonly, called, as, kori, agung, or, paduraksa, and, also, split, gate, of, candi, bentar, the, large, split, gate, of, wringin, lawang, located, at, jatipasar, trowulan, mojokerto, east, java, is, one, of, the, oldest, and, the, largest, surviving, candi, bentar, dated, from, majapahit, era, the, candi, bentar, took, shape, of, typical, majapahit, temple, structure, consists, of, three, parts, foot, body, and, tall, roof, evenly, split, into, two, mirroring, structures, to, make, a, passage, in, the, centre, for, people, to, walk, through, this, type, of, split, gate, has, no, doors, and, provides, no, real, defensive, purpose, but, narrowing, the, passage, it, probably, only, served, the, ceremonial, and, aesthetic, purpose, to, create, the, sense, of, grandeur, before, entering, the, next, compound, through, tall, roof, paduraksa, gate, with, enclosed, door, the, example, of, kori, agung, or, paduraksa, style, gate, is, the, elegant, bajang, ratu, gate, richly, decorated, with, kala, demon, cyclops, and, also, the, bas, relief, telling, the, story, of, sri, tanjung, those, typical, majapahit, architectural, style, has, deeply, influenced, the, javanese, and, balinese, architecture, of, later, period, the, current, prevalence, of, majapahit, style, pendopo, pavilion, candi, bentar, and, paduraksa, gates, was, owed, to, the, influence, of, majapahit, aesthetics, on, javanese, and, balinese, architecture, in, later, period, near, the, fall, of, majapahit, the, art, and, architecture, of, majapahit, witnessed, the, revival, of, indigenous, native, austronesian, megalithic, architectural, elements, such, as, sukuh, and, cetho, temples, on, western, slopes, of, mount, lawu, unlike, previous, majapahit, temples, that, demonstrate, typical, hindu, architecture, of, high, rise, towering, structure, the, shape, of, these, temples, are, step, pyramid, quite, similar, to, mesoamerican, pyramids, the, stepped, pyramid, structure, called, punden, berundak, stepped, mounds, is, a, common, megalithic, structure, during, indonesian, prehistoric, era, before, the, adoption, of, hindu, buddhist, culture, the, daoyi, zhi, which, was, written, ca, 1339, ce, mentioned, about, java, s, wealth, and, prosperity, of, the, period, the, fields, of, java, are, rich, and, its, soil, is, level, and, well, watered, therefore, grain, and, rice, are, abundant, twice, as, much, as, in, other, countries, the, people, do, not, steal, and, what, is, dropped, on, the, road, is, not, taken, up, the, common, saying, prosperous, java, means, this, country, men, and, women, wrap, up, their, head, and, wear, long, clothes, 124, also, in, yingya, shenglan, ma, huan, reported, the, javanese, economy, and, market, rice, is, harvested, twice, a, year, and, its, grain, is, small, they, also, harvest, white,

fruits, there, are, all, kinds, of, bananas, coconut, sugarcane, pomegranate, lotus, mang, chi, shi, manggis, or, mangosteen, watermelon, and, lang, ch, a, langsat, or, lanzones, mang, chi, shi, is, something, like, a, pomegranate, peel, it, like, an, orange, it, has, four, lumps, of, white, flesh, sweet, and, sour, taste, and, very, delicious, lang, ch, a, is, a, fruit, similar, to, loquat, but, larger, contained, three, blocky, white, flesh, with, a, sweet, and, sour, taste, sugarcane, has, white, stems, large, and, coarse, with, roots, reaching, 3, chang, 30, feet, 7, inches, in, addition, all, types, of, squash, and, vegetables, are, there, just, a, shortage, of, peach, plum, and, leek, taxes, and, fines, were, paid, in, cash, javanese, economy, had, been, partly, monetised, since, the, late, 8th, century, using, gold, and, silver, coins, previously, the, 9th, century, wonoboyo, hoard, discovered, in, central, java, shows, that, ancient, javan, gold, coins, were, seed, shaped, similar, to, corn, while, the, silver, coins, were, similar, to, buttons, in, about, the, year, 1300, in, the, reign, of, majapahit, s, first, king, an, important, change, took, place, the, indigenous, coinage, was, completely, replaced, by, imported, chinese, copper, cash, about, 10, 388, ancient, chinese, coins, weighing, about, 40, kg, were, even, unearthed, from, the, backyard, of, a, local, commoner, in, sidoarjo, in, november, 2008, indonesian, ancient, relics, conservation, bureau, bp3, of, east, java, verified, that, those, coins, dated, as, early, as, majapahit, era, the, reason, for, using, the, foreign, currency, is, not, given, in, any, source, but, most, scholars, assume, it, was, due, to, the, increasing, complexity, of, javanese, economy, and, a, desire, for, a, currency, system, that, used, much, smaller, denominations, suitable, for, use, in, everyday, market, transactions, this, was, a, role, for, which, gold, and, silver, are, not, well, suited, 107, these, kepeng, chinese, coins, were, thin, rounded, copper, coins, with, a, square, hole, in, the, centre, of, it, the, hole, was, meant, to, tie, together, the, money, in, a, string, of, coins, these, small, changes, the, imported, chinese, copper, coins, enabled, majapahit, further, invention, a, method, of, savings, by, using, a, slitted, earthenware, coin, container, these, are, commonly, found, in, majapahit, ruins, the, slit, in, the, small, opening, to, put, the, coins, in, the, most, popular, shape, is, boar, shaped, celengan, piggy, bank, some, idea, of, the, scale, of, the, internal, economy, can, be, gathered, from, scattered, data, in, inscriptions, the, canggu, inscriptions, dated, 1358, mentions, 78, ferry, crossings, in, the, country, mandala, java, 107, majapahit, inscriptions, mention, a, large, number, of, occupational, specialities, ranging, from, gold, and, silversmiths, to, drink, vendors, and, butchers, although, many, of, these, occupations, had, existed, in, earlier, times, the, proportion, of, the, population, earning, an, income, from, non, agrarian, pursuits, seems, to, have, become, even, greater, during, the, majapahit, era, the, great, prosperity, of, majapahit, was, probably, due, to, two, factors, firstly, the, northeast, lowlands, of, java, were, suitable, for, rice, cultivation, and, during, majapahit, s, prime, numerous, irrigation, projects, were, undertaken, some, with, government, assistance, secondly, majapahit, s, ports, on, the, north, coast, were, probably, significant, stations, along, the, route, to, obtain, the, spices, of, maluku, and, as, the, spices, passed, through, java, they, would, have, provided, an, important, source, of, income, for, majapahit, 107, the, nagarakretagama, states, that, the, fame, of, the, ruler, of, wilwatikta, a, synonym, for, majapahit, attracted, foreign, merchants, from, far, and, wide, including, indians, khmers, siamese, and, chinese, among, others, while, in, the, later, period, yingya, shenglan, mentioned, that, large, numbers, of, chinese, traders, and, muslim, merchants, from, the, west, from, arab, and, india, but, mostly, from, muslim, states, in, sumatra, and, the, malay, peninsula, are, settling, in, majapahit, port, cities, such, as, tuban, gresik, and, hujung, galuh, surabaya, a, special, tax, was, levied, against, some, foreigners, possibly, those, who, had, taken, up, semi, permanent, residence, in, java, and, conducted, some, type, of, enterprise, other, than, foreign, trade, the, majapahit, empire, had, trading, links, with, chinese, ming, dynasty, i, vi, t, and, champa, in, today, vietnam, cambodia, siamese, ayutthayan, burmese, martaban, and, the, south, indian, vijayanagara, empire, during, the, majapahit, era, almost, all, of, the, commodities, from, asia, were, found, in, java, this, is, because, of, extensive, shipping, by, the, majapahit, empire, using, various, type, of, ships, particularly, the, jong, for, trading, to, faraway, places, ma, huan, zheng, he, s, translator, who, visited, java, in, 1413, stated, that, ports, in, java, were, trading, goods, and, offer, services, that, were, more, numerous, and, more, complete, than, other, ports, in, southeast, asia, during, the, reign, of, hayam, wuruk, majapahit, employed, a, well, organised, bureaucratic, structure, for, administrative, purposes, the, hierarchy, and, structure, relatively, remain, intact, and, unchanged, throughout, majapahit, history, the, king, is, the, paramount, ruler, as, the, chakravartin, he, is, considered, the, universal, ruler, and, believed, to, be, the, living, god, on, earth, the, king, holds, the, highest, political, authority, and, legitimacy, the, law, and, order, of, majapahit, kingdom, follows, the, regulations, related, to, the, criminal, code, of, law, which, became, the, guidelines, for, people, s, lives, at, that, time, this, rule, of, law, can, be, found, in, a, manuscript, called, kutaramanawa, dharmashastra, or, translated, as, the, book, of, religious, legislation, according, to, the, historian, slamet, muljana, s, notes, in, the, book, perundang, undangan, madjapahit, 1967, there, is, no, definite, record, regarding, the, time, when, this, criminal, law, was, drafted, however, based, on, some, evidence, it, can, be, concluded, that, this, book, of, law, written, in, old, javanese, was, originated, from, the, majapahit, period, during, the, reign, of, king, rajasanagara, in, majapahit, the, punishment, for, the, crime, of, murder, was, death, according, to, the, manuscript, kidung, sorandaka, it, was, said, that, demung, sora, a, minister, of, majapahit, court, was, sentenced, to, death, penalty, under, the, astadusta, provisions, for, his, crime, on, killing, mahisa, anabrang, astadusta, is, a, part, of, the, kutaramanawa, dharmashastra, which, regulates, the, punishment, for, murder, overall, this, criminal, code, consists, of, 19, sections, that, regulate, various, aspects, of, life, in, addition, to, the, punishment, for, the, crime, of, murders, which, are, summarised, in, the, astadusta, section, there, are, also, rules, regarding,

classic, rivalry, between, sumatran, malay, states, and, javanese, kingdoms, has, shaped, the, dynamics, of, geopolitics, in, the, region, their, activities, in, guarding, the, sea, in, pursuit, of, their, economic, interest, plus, their, military, activities, to, safeguard, this, interests, has, led, to, conflicts, between, malays, and, javanese, since, early, of, its, formation, majapahit, inherited, the, foreign, outlook, of, its, predecessor, entity, singhasari, kingdom, in, which, its, last, king, kertanegara, projected, his, influence, abroad, by, launching, pamalayu, expedition, 1275, 1293, to, incorporate, malay, polities, in, sumatra, and, the, malay, peninsula, within, javanese, sphere, of, influence, previously, singhasari, seeks, to, dominate, trade, route, especially, malacca, strait, and, also, saw, the, outreach, of, mongolian, chinese, yuan, influence, into, southeast, asia, as, the, threat, to, their, interest, during, its, formation, the, returning, pamalayu, expedition, in, 1293, has, brought, malayu, kingdoms, in, jambi, and, dharmasraya, under, javanese, suzerainty, therefore, java, often, considers, itself, as, the, overlord, of, most, of, the, polities, in, the, indonesian, archipelago, during, the, reign, of, majapahit, s, first, two, monarch, wijaya, and, jayanegara, the, kingdom, struggled, to, consolidate, its, rule, plagued, by, several, rebellions, however, it, was, not, until, the, reign, of, its, third, monarch, queen, tribhuwana, tunggadewi, and, her, son, hayam, wuruk, that, the, kingdom, began, to, project, its, power, overseas, majapahit, s, confidence, for, dominance, was, stemmed, for, their, economic, and, demographic, comparative, advantage, agrarian, as, well, as, a, maritime, nation, their, large, rice, production, immense, human, resources, well, organized, society, also, their, mastery, in, shipbuilding, navigation, and, military, technology, are, excellent, relatively, compared, to, their, neighbours, these, strengths, were, used, by, gajah, mada, to, expand, the, kingdom, s, influence, and, building, a, maritime, empire, this, rather, imperialistic, outlook, has, projected, in, the, way, he, forcefully, dealt, with, majapahit, s, neighbours, the, pabali, conquest, of, bali, 1342, 1343, and, the, pasunda, bubat, 1356, majapahit, pulled, bali, into, their, orbit, as, a, vassal, state, while, the, disastrous, diplomacy, with, the, sunda, kingdom, has, led, to, the, enmity, among, them, majapahit, overlordship, upon, malay, states, of, sumatra, was, demonstrated, by, the, rule, of, adityawarman, of, malayupura, adityawarman, the, cousin, of, king, jayanegara, was, raised, within, majapahit, palace, and, rose, to, become, a, senior, minister, in, majapahit, court, he, was, sent, to, led, majapahit, military, expansion, to, conquer, east, coast, region, in, sumatra, adityawarman, then, founded, the, royal, dynasty, of, minangkabau, in, pagarruyung, and, presided, over, the, central, sumatra, region, to, take, control, of, the, gold, trade, between, 1347, and, 1375, within, indonesian, archipelago, majapahit, saw, itself, as, the, centre, of, a, huge, mandala, this, notion, is, demonstrated, by, its, three, tier, administrative, hierarchy, nagara, agung, mancanegara, and, nusantara, in, sumatran, front, majapahit, did, capture, palembang, jambi, and, dharmasraya, invade, pasai, and, it, also, saw, the, settlement, of, tumasik, that, later, become, kingdom, of, singapura, as, its, rebellious, colony, and, thus, deal, with, them, accordingly, in, later, years, after, the, era, of, hayam, wuruk, majapahit, has, lost, their, grips, on, some, of, their, overseas, possessions, this, led, to, the, thrive, and, the, rise, of, several, polities, previously, held, under, majapahit, domination, such, as, brunei, and, malacca, the, rise, of, malacca, in, the, 15th, century, in, particular, is, important, because, it, represents, majapahit, eventual, failure, to, control, malacca, strait, previously, majapahit, tried, to, contain, the, rise, of, a, potential, regional, rival, a, malay, polity, in, par, with, srivijaya, by, punishing, a, rebellion, in, palembang, and, capturing, singapura, in, this, sense, malacca, was, indeed, the, rival, of, majapahit, in, the, competition, to, dominate, the, archipelagic, realm, despite, this, perceived, rivalry, in, practice, however, the, two, kingdoms, had, some, close, and, intense, economic, and, cultural, relations, at, that, time, the, trade, link, between, majapahit, ports, of, hujung, galuh, and, tuban, with, the, port, of, melaka, must, have, thrived, majapahit, true, rival, for, domination, however, was, the, powerful, ming, chinese, after, the, fall, of, yuan, the, ming, emperor, eager, to, project, his, power, into, southeast, asia, on, the, other, hand, majapahit, saw, this, archipelagic, realm, as, theirs, and, unwelcome, to, any, perceived, chinese, interference, after, majapahit, was, weakened, by, paregreg, civil, war, and, incessant, conflicts, among, its, nobles, the, arrival, of, the, formidable, ming, treasure, voyages, led, by, zheng, he, upon, majapahit, shores, has, pushed, majapahit, prestige, and, power, to, the, side, ming, on, the, other, hand, actively, support, the, rise, of, malacca, this, ming, protection, has, made, majapahit, unwilling, and, unable, to, push, malacca, anymore, majapahit, ultimate, nemesis, however, was, located, very, close, at, home, the, demak, sultanate, on, the, northern, coast, of, central, java, ming, support, to, malacca, and, malacca, active, proselytizing, of, islam, has, led, to, the, thriving, and, rise, of, muslim, traders, community, in, the, archipelago, including, in, majapahit, ports, on, the, north, coast, of, java, this, in, turn, gradually, corroded, the, prestige, of, javanese, hindu, buddhist, kingship, and, after, several, generations, led, to, the, fall, of, once, mighty, majapahit, empire, majapahit, was, the, largest, empire, ever, to, form, in, southeast, asia, 107, although, its, political, power, beyond, the, core, area, in, east, java, was, diffuse, constituting, mainly, ceremonial, recognition, of, suzerainty, majapahit, society, developed, a, high, degree, of, sophistication, in, both, commercial, and, artistic, activities, its, capital, was, inhabited, by, a, cosmopolitan, population, among, whom, literature, and, art, flourished, 107, numbers, of, local, legends, and, folklores, in, the, region, had, mentioned, about, the, majapahit, kingdom, other, than, javanese, sources, some, regional, legends, mentioning, majapahit, kingdom, or, its, general, gajah, mada, also, can, be, found, from, aceh, minangkabau, palembang, the, malay, peninsula, sunda, brunei, bali, to, sumbawa, most, of, them, mentioned, about, the, incoming, javanese, forces, to, their, land, which, was, probably, a, local, testament, of, the, empire, s, expansive, nature, that, once, dominating, the, archipelago, the, hikayat, raja, pasai, a, 14th, century, aceh, chronicle, tell, a, majapahit, naval, invasion, against, samudra, pasai, in, 1350, the, chronicle, described, that, the, majapahit, invasion, was, a, punishment, for, sultan, ahmad, malik, az, zahir, s, crime, on, ruining, a, royal, marriage, between, pasai, prince, tun, abdul, jalil, and, raden, galuh, gemerencang, a, majapahit, princess, that, led, to, the, death, of, the, royal, couple, in, west, sumatra, the, legend, of, minangkabau, mentioned, an, invading, foreign, prince, associated, with, javanese, majapahit, kingdom, being, defeated, in, a, buffalo, fight, in, west, java, the, pasunda, bubat, tragedy, caused, a, myth, to, revolve, around, indonesians, which, forbids, marriage, between, a, sundanese, and, a, javanese, as, it, would, be, unsustainable, and, only, bring, misery, to, the, couple, in, malay, peninsula, the, malay, annals, mentioned, the, legend, of, the, fall, of, singapura, to, majapahit, forces, in, 1398, was, due, to, the, betrayal, of, sang, rajuna, tapa, that, opened, the, fortified, city, gate, in, brunei, the, folk, legend, of, lumut, lunting, and, pilong, pilongan, islands, in, brunei, bay, also, connected, to, majapahit, several, javanese, legends, were, originated, or, become, popular, during, the, majapahit, period, the, panji, cycles, the, tale, of, sri, tanjung, and, the, epic, of, damarwulan, are, popular, tales, in, javanese, and, balinese, literatures, the, tales, of, panji, was, dated, from, the, older, period, during, kediri, kingdom, while, the, tale, of, sri, tanjung, and, the, epic, of, damarwulan, took, place, during, the, majapahit, period, these, tales, remained, a, popular, theme, in, javanese, culture, of, later, period, during, mataram, sultanate, and, often, became, the, source, of, inspiration, for, wayang, shadow, puppet, performance, ketoprak, and, topeng, dance, drama, the, panji, tales, in, particular, have, spread, from, east, java, to, become, a, source, of, inspiration, for, literature, and, dance, drama, throughout, the, region, as, far, as, the, malay, peninsula, cambodia, and, siam, where, he, is, known, as, raden, inao, or, enau, thai, of, kurepan, majapahit, had, a, momentous, and, lasting, influence, on, indonesian, art, and, architecture, the, empire, s, expansion, circa, 14th, century, contributed, to, the, diffusion, javanese, cultural, influence, throughout, the, archipelago, which, can, be, seen, as, a, form, of, javanisation, it, was, probably, during, this, period, that, some, of, the, javanese, cultural, elements, such, as, gamelan, and, kris, being, expanded, and, introduced, to, islands, outside, of, java, the, descriptions, of, the, architecture, of, the, capital, s, pavilions, pendopo, in, the, nagarakretagama, evoke, the, javanese, kraton, also, the, balinese, temples, and, palace, compounds, of, today, the, majapahit, architectural, style, that, often, employs, terracotta, and, red, brick, heavily, influenced, the, architecture, of, java, and, bali, in, the, later, period, the, majapahit, style, candi, bentar, split, gate, the, kori, or, paduraksa, towering, red, brick, gate, and, also, pendopo, pavilion, have, become, ubiquitous, in, javanese, and, balinese, architectural, features, as, seen, in, menara, kudus, mosque, keraton, kasepuhan, and, sunyaragi, park, in, cirebon, mataram, sultanate, royal, cemetery, in, kota, gede, yogyakarta, and, various, palaces, and, temples, in, bali, the, vivid, rich, and, festive, balinese, culture, is, considered, one, of, majapahit, s, legacy, the, javanese, hindu, civilisation, since, the, era, of, airlangga, to, the, era, of, majapahit, kings, has, profoundly, influenced, and, shaped, the, balinese, culture, and, history, the, ancient, links, and, majapahit, legacy, is, observable, in, many, ways, architecture, literature, religious, rituals, dance, drama, and, artforms, the, aesthetics, and, style, of, bas, reliefs, in, majapahit, east, javanese, temples, were, preserved, and, copied, in, balinese, temples, it, is, also, because, after, the, fall, of, the, empire, many, majapahit, nobles, artisans, and, priests, had, taken, refuge, either, in, the, interior, mountainous, region, of, east, java, or, across, the, narrow, strait, to, bali, indeed, in, some, ways, the, kingdom, of, bali, was, the, successor, of, majapahit, large, numbers, of, majapahit, manuscripts, such, as, nagarakretagama, sutasoma, pararaton, and, tantu, pagelaran, were, being, well, kept, in, royal, libraries, of, bali, and, lombok, and, provides, the, glimpse, and, valuable, historical, records, on, majapahit, the, majapahit, hindu, javanese, culture, has, shaped, the, culture, of, bali, that, led, to, popular, expression, without, java, there, is, no, bali, yet, in, return, bali, is, credited, as, the, last, stronghold, to, safeguard, and, preserve, the, ancient, hindu, javanese, civilisation, in, weaponry, the, majapahit, expansion, is, believed, to, be, responsible, for, the, widespread, use, of, the, keris, dagger, in, southeast, asia, from, java, bali, sumatra, malaysia, brunei, to, southern, thailand, although, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, keris, and, native, daggers, similar, to, it, predate, majapahit, nevertheless, the, empire, expansion, contributed, to, its, popularity, and, diffusion, in, the, region, around, the, year, 1492, for, example, kris, of, knaud, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, kris, is, dated, to, 1264, saka, which, correspondents, to, 1342, the, malay, legend, of, kris, taming, sari, is, also, attributed, to, majapahit, origin, for, indonesians, in, later, centuries, majapahit, became, a, symbol, of, past, greatness, the, islamic, sultanates, of, demak, pajang, and, mataram, sought, to, establish, their, legitimacy, to, the, majapahit, 40, the, demak, claimed, a, line, of, succession, through,

genealogy, that, attempt, to, prove, links, back, to, the, majapahit, royal, lines, usually, in, the, form, of, a, grave, as, a, vital, link, in, java, where, legitimacy, is, enhanced, by, such, a, connection, bali, in, particular, was, heavily, influenced, by, majapahit, and, the, balinese, consider, themselves, to, be, the, true, heirs, of, the, kingdom, modern, indonesian, nationalists, including, those, of, the, early, 20th, century, indonesian, national, revival, have, invoked, the, majapahit, empire, indonesian, founding, fathers, especially, sukarno, and, mohammad, yamin, built, a, historical, construct, around, majapahit, to, argue, for, the, ancient, unified, realm, as, a, predecessor, of, modern, indonesia, the, memory, of, its, greatness, remains, in, indonesia, and, is, sometimes, seen, as, a, precedent, for, the, current, political, boundaries, of, the, republic, 19, many, of, modern, indonesian, national, symbols, derived, from, majapahit, hindu, buddhist, elements, the, indonesian, national, motto, bhinneka, tunggal, ika, is, a, quotation, from, an, old, javanese, poem, kakawin, sutasoma, written, by, a, majapahit, poet, mpu, tantular, the, indonesian,
