jewish, history, is, the, history, of, the, jews, their, nation, religion, and, culture, as, it, developed, and, interacted, with, other, peoples, religions, and, cultures, jews, originated, from, the, israelites, and, hebrews, of, historical, israel, and, judah, two, related, kingdoms, that, emerged, in, the, levant, during, the, iron, age, although, the, earliest, mention, of, israel, is, inscribed, on, the, merneptah, stele, around, 1213, 1203, bce, religious, literature, tells, the, story, of, israelites, going, back, at, least, as, far, as, c, 1500, bce, the, kingdom, of, israel, fell, to, the, neo, assyrian, empire, in, around, 720, bce, and, the, kingdom, of, judah, to, the, neo, babylonian, empire, in, 586, bce, part, of, the, judean, population, was, exiled, to, babylon, the, assyrian, and, babylonian, captivities, are, regarded, as, representing, the, start, of, the, jewish, diaspora, after, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, conquered, the, region, the, exiled, jews, were, allowed, to, return, and, rebuild, the, temple, these, events, mark, the, beginning, of, the, second, temple, period, after, several, centuries, of, foreign, rule, the, maccabean, revolt, against, the, seleucid, empire, led, to, an, independent, hasmonean, kingdom, but, it, was, gradually, incorporated, into, roman, rule, the, jewish, roman, wars, a, series, of, unsuccessful, revolts, against, the, romans, in, the, 1st, and, 2nd, centuries, ce, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, and, the, second, temple, and, the, expulsion, of, many, jews, the, jewish, population, in, syria, palaestina, gradually, decreased, during, the, following, centuries, enhancing, the, role, of, the, jewish, diaspora, and, shifting, the, spiritual, and, demographic, centre, from, the, depopulated, judea, to, galilee, and, then, to, babylon, with, smaller, communities, spread, out, across, the, roman, empire, during, the, same, period, the, mishnah, and, the, talmud, central, jewish, texts, were, composed, in, the, following, millennia, the, diaspora, communities, coalesced, into, three, major, ethnic, subdivisions, according, to, where, their, ancestors, settled, the, ashkenazim, central, and, eastern, europe, the, sephardim, initially, in, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, mizrahim, middle, east, and, north, africa, byzantine, rule, over, the, levant, was, lost, in, the, 7th, century, as, the, newly, established, islamic, caliphate, expanded, into, the, eastern, mediterranean, mesopotamia, north, africa, and, later, into, the, iberian, peninsula, jewish, culture, enjoyed, a, golden, age, in, spain, with, jews, becoming, widely, accepted, in, society, and, their, religious, cultural, and, economic, life, blossomed, however, in, 1492, the, jews, were, forced, to, leave, spain, and, migrated, in, great, numbers, to, the, ottoman, empire, and, italy, between, the, 12th, and, 15th, centuries, ashkenazi, jews, experienced, extreme, persecution, in, central, europe, which, prompted, their, mass, migration, to, poland, the, 18th, century, saw, the, rise, of, the, haskalah, intellectual, movement, also, starting, in, the, 18th, century, jews, began, to, campaign, for, jewish, emancipation, from, restrictive, laws, and, integration, into, the, wider, european, society, in, the, 19th, century, when, jews, in, western, europe, were, increasingly, granted, equality, before, the, law, jews, in, the, pale, of, settlement, faced, growing, persecution, legal, restrictions, and, widespread, pogroms, during, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, the, jewish, population, in, europe, began, to, more, actively, discuss, emigration, to, ottoman, syria, with, the, aim, of, re, establishing, a, jewish, polity, in, palestine, the, zionist, movement, was, officially, founded, in, 1897, the, pogroms, also, triggered, a, mass, exodus, of, more, than, two, million, jews, to, the, united, states, between, 1881, and, 1924, the, jews, of, europe, and, the, united, states, gained, success, in, the, fields, of, science, culture, and, the, economy, among, those, generally, considered, the, most, famous, were, albert, einstein, and, ludwig, wittgenstein, many, nobel, prize, winners, at, this, time, were, jewish, as, is, still, the, case, in, 1933, with, the, rise, to, power, of, adolf, hitler, and, the, nazi, party, in, germany, the, jewish, situation, became, severe, economic, crises, racial, antisemitic, laws, and, a, fear, of, an, upcoming, war, led, many, to, flee, from, europe, to, mandatory, palestine, to, the, united, states, and, to, the, soviet, union, in, 1939, world, war, ii, began, and, until, 1941, hitler, occupied, almost, all, of, europe, in, 1941, following, the, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, the, final, solution, began, an, extensive, organized, operation, on, an, unprecedented, scale, aimed, at, the, annihilation, of, the, jewish, people, and, resulting, in, the, persecution, and, murder, of, jews, in, europe, and, north, africa, in, poland, three, million, were, murdered, in, gas, chambers, in, all, concentration, camps, combined, with, one, million, at, the, auschwitz, camp, complex, alone, this, genocide, in, which, approximately, six, million, jews, were, methodically, exterminated, is, known, as, the, holocaust, before, and, during, the, holocaust, enormous, numbers, of, jews, immigrated, to, mandatory, palestine, on, may, 14, 1948, upon, the, termination, of, the, british, mandate, david, ben, gurion, declared, the, creation, of, the, state, of, israel, a, jewish, and, democratic, state, in, eretz, israel, land, of, israel, immediately, afterwards, all, neighbouring, arab, states, invaded, yet, the, newly, formed, idf, resisted, in, 1949, the, war, ended, and, israel, started, building, the, state, and, absorbing, massive, waves, of, aliyah, from, all, over, europe, and, middle, eastern, countries, as, of, 2022, israel, is, a, parliamentary, democracy, with, a, population, of, 9, 6, million, people, of, whom, 7, million, are, jewish, the, largest, jewish, community, outside, israel, is, the, united, states, while, large, communities, also, exist, in, france, canada, argentina, russia, united, kingdom, australia, and, germany, for, statistics, related, to, modern, jewish, demographics, see, jewish, population, ancient, jewish, history, is, known, from, the, bible, extra, biblical, sources, apocrypha, and, pseudoepigrapha, the, writings, of, josephus, greco, roman, authors, and, church, fathers, as, well, as, archaeological, finds, inscriptions, ancient, documents, such, as, the, papyri, from, elephantine, and, the, fayyum, the, dead, sea, scrolls, the, bar, kokhba, letters, the, babatha, archives, and, the, cairo, genizah, documents, supplemented, by, oral, history, and, the, collection, of, commentaries, in, the, midrash, and, talmud, with, the, rise, of, the, printing, press, and, movable, type, in, the, early, modern, period, jewish, histories, and, early, editions, of, the, torah, tanakh, were, published, which, dealt, with, the, history, of, the, jewish, religion, and, increasingly, national, histories, of, the, jews, jewish, peoplehood, and, identity, this, was, a, move, from, a, manuscript, or, scribal, culture, to, a, printing, culture, jewish, historians, wrote, accounts, of, their, collective, experiences, but, also, increasingly, used, history, for, political, cultural, and, scientific, or, philosophical, exploration, writers, drew, upon, a, corpus, of, culturally, inherited, text, in, seeking, to, construct, a, logical, narrative, to, critique, or, advance, the, state, of, the, art, modern, jewish, historiography, intertwines, with, intellectual, movements, such, as, the, european, renaissance, and, the, age, of, enlightenment, but, drew, upon, earlier, works, in, the, late, middle, ages, and, into, diverse, sources, in, antiquity, today, the, history, of, the, jews, and, judaism, is, often, divided, into, six, periods, the, history, of, the, early, jews, and, their, neighbours, centres, on, the, fertile, crescent, and, east, coast, of, the, mediterranean, sea, it, begins, among, those, people, who, occupied, the, area, lying, between, the, river, nile, and, mesopotamia, surrounded, by, ancient, seats, of, culture, in, egypt, and, babylonia, by, the, deserts, of, arabia, and, by, the, highlands, of, asia, minor, the, land, of, canaan, roughly, corresponding, to, modern, israel, the, palestinian, territories, jordan, and, lebanon, was, a, meeting, place, of, civilizations, the, earliest, recorded, evidence, of, a, people, by, the, name, of, israel, appears, in, the, merneptah, stele, of, ancient, egypt, dated, to, about, 1200, bce, according, to, the, modern, archaeological, account, the, israelites, and, their, culture, branched, out, of, the, canaanite, peoples, and, their, cultures, through, the, development, of, a, distinct, monolatristic, and, later, monotheistic, religion, centred, on, the, national, god, yahweh, they, spoke, an, archaic, form, of, the, hebrew, language, known, today, as, biblical, hebrew, the, traditional, religious, view, of, jews, and, judaism, of, their, own, history, was, based, on, the, narrative, of, the, ancient, hebrew, bible, in, this, view, abraham, signifying, that, he, is, both, the, biological, progenitor, of, the, jews, and, the, father, of, judaism, is, the, first, jew, later, isaac, was, born, to, abraham, and, jacob, was, born, to, isaac, following, a, struggle, with, an, angel, jacob, was, given, the, name, israel, following, a, severe, drought, jacob, and, his, twelve, sons, fled, to, egypt, where, they, eventually, formed, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, the, israelites, were, later, led, out, of, slavery, in, egypt, and, subsequently, brought, to, canaan, by, moses, they, eventually, conquered, canaan, under, the, leadership, of, joshua, modern, scholars, agree, that, the, bible, does, not, provide, an, authentic, account, of, the, israelites, origins, the, consensus, supports, that, the, archaeological, evidence, showing, largely, indigenous, origins, of, israel, in, canaan, not, egypt, is, overwhelming, and, leaves, no, room, for, an, exodus, from, egypt, or, a, 40, year, pilgrimage, through, the, sinai, wilderness, many, archaeologists, have, abandoned, the, archaeological, investigation, of, moses, and, the, exodus, as, a, fruitless, pursuit, however, it, is, accepted, that, this, narrative, does, have, a, historical, core, to, it, a, century, of, research, by, archaeologists, and, egyptologists, has, arguably, found, no, evidence, that, can, be, directly, related, to, the, exodus, narrative, of, an, egyptian, captivity, and, the, escape, and, travels, through, the, wilderness, leading, to, the, suggestion, that, iron, age, israel, the, kingdoms, of, judah, and, israel, has, its, origins, in, canaan, not, in, egypt, the, culture, of, the, earliest, israelite, settlements, is, canaanite, their, cult, objects, are, those, of, the, canaanite, god, el, the, pottery, remains, in, the, local, canaanite, tradition, and, the, alphabet, used, is, early, canaanite, the, almost, sole, marker, distinguishing, the, israelite, villages, from, canaanite, sites, is, an, absence, of, pig, bones, although, whether, this, can, be, taken, as, an, ethnic, marker, or, is, due, to, other, factors, remains, a, matter, of, dispute, according, to, the, biblical, narrative, the, land, of, israel, was, organized, into, a, confederacy, of, twelve, tribes, ruled, by, a, series, of, judges, for, several, hundred, years, two, israelite, kingdoms, emerged, during, iron, age, ii, israel, and, judah, the, bible, portrays, israel, and, judah, as, the, successors, of, an, earlier, united, kingdom, of, israel, although, its, historicity, is, disputed, historians, and, archaeologists, agree, that, the, northern, kingdom, of, israel, existed, from, ca, 900, bce, 169, 195, and, that, the, kingdom, of, judah, existed, from, ca, 700, bce, the, tel, dan, stele, discovered, in, 1993, shows, that, the, kingdom, at, least, in, some, form, existed, by, the, middle, of, the, 9th, century, bce, but, it, does, not, indicate, the, extent, of, its, power, biblical, tradition, tells, that, the, israelite, monarchy, was, established, in, 1037, bce, under, saul, and, continued, under, david, and, his, son, solomon, david, greatly, expanded, the, kingdom, s, borders, and, conquered, jerusalem, from, the, jebusites, turning, it, into, the, national, political, and, religious, capital, of, the, kingdom, solomon, his, son, later, built, the, first, temple, on, mount, moriah, in, jerusalem, upon, his, death, traditionally, dated, to, c, 930, bce, a, civil, war, erupted, between, the, ten, northern, israelite, tribes, and, the, tribes, of, judah, simeon, was, absorbed, into, judah, and, benjamin, in, the, south, the, kingdom, then, split, into, the, kingdom, of, israel, in, the, north, and, the, kingdom, of, judah, in, the, south, the, kingdom, of, israel, was, the, more, prosperous, of, the, two, kingdoms, and, soon, developed, into, a, regional, power, during, the, days, of, the, omride, dynasty, it, controlled, samaria, galilee, the, upper, jordan, valley, the, sharon, and, large, parts, of, the, transjordan, samaria, the, capital, was, home, to, one, of, the, largest, iron, age, palaces, in, the, levant, the, kingdom, of, israel, was, destroyed, around, 720, bce, when, it, was, conquered, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, the, kingdom, of, judah, with, its, capital, in, jerusalem, controlled, the, judaean, mountains, the, shephelah, the, judaean, desert, and, parts, of, the, negev, after, the, fall, of, israel, judah, became, a, client, state, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, in, the, 7th, century, bce, the, kingdom, s, population, increased, greatly, prospering, under, assyrian, vassalage, despite, hezekiah, s, revolt, against, the, assyrian, king, sennacherib, large, parts, of, the, hebrew, bible, were, written, during, this, period, this, includes, the, earliest, portions, of, hosea, isaiah, amos, and, micah, along, with, nahum, zephaniah, most, of, deuteronomy, the, first, edition, of, the, deuteronomistic, history, the, books, of, joshua, judges, samuel, kings, and, habakkuk, with, the, collapse, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, in, 605, bce, a, power, struggle, emerged, between, egypt, and, the, neo, babylonian, empire, for, control, of, the, levant, leading, to, judah, s, rapid, decline, in, 601, bce, king, jehoiakim, of, judah, who, had, recently, submitted, to, babylon, rebelled, against, the, empire, he, was, soon, succeeded, by, his, son, jehoiachin, who, continued, his, father, s, policy, and, faced, a, babylonian, invasion, in, march, 597, bce, jehoiachin, surrendered, to, the, babylonians, and, was, taken, captive, to, babylon, this, defeat, is, documented, in, the, babylonian, chronicles, zedekiah, jehoiachin, s, uncle, was, then, installed, as, king, by, the, babylonians, in, 587, or, 586, bce, nebuchadnezzar, ii, responding, to, a, second, revolt, in, judah, besieged, and, destroyed, jerusalem, the, first, temple, was, razed, and, its, sacred, vessels, were, seized, as, spoils, the, destruction, was, followed, by, a, mass, exile, the, surviving, inhabitants, of, the, city, including, other, segments, of, the, population, were, carried, off, to, mesopotamia, marking, the, onset, of, the, era, known, in, jewish, history, as, the, babylonian, captivity, zedekiah, himself, was, captured, blinded, and, transported, to, babylon, others, fled, to, egypt, the, people, of, judah, lost, their, statehood, and, for, those, in, exile, their, homeland, following, the, dissolution, of, the, monarchy, the, former, kingdom, was, annexed, as, a, province, of, the, babylonian, empire, during, the, several, decades, between, the, fall, of, judah, and, their, return, to, zion, under, persian, rule, jewish, history, enters, an, obscure, phase, many, jews, were, exiled, across, babylonia, elam, and, egypt, while, others, remained, in, judea, jeremiah, refers, to, communities, in, egypt, including, settlements, in, migdol, tahpanhes, noph, and, pathros, moreover, a, jewish, military, colony, existed, at, elephantine, established, before, the, exile, where, they, built, their, own, shrine, deuteronomy, was, expanded, and, earlier, scriptures, were, edited, during, the, exilic, period, the, first, edition, of, jeremiah, the, book, of, ezekiel, the, majority, of, obadiah, and, what, is, referred, to, in, research, as, second, isaiah, were, all, written, during, this, time, period, as, well, according, to, the, book, of, ezra, persian, cyrus, the, great, king, of, the, achaemenid, empire, brought, an, end, to, the, babylonian, exile, in, 538, bce, a, year, after, his, conquest, of, babylon, the, return, from, exile, was, led, by, zerubbabel, a, prince, from, the, royal, line, of, david, and, joshua, the, priest, descended, from, former, high, priests, of, the, temple, they, oversaw, the, construction, of, the, second, temple, completed, between, 521, and, 516, bce, as, part, of, the, persian, empire, the, former, kingdom, of, judah, became, the, province, of, judah, yehud, medinata, with, different, borders, covering, a, smaller, territory, contemporary, scholars, point, to, a, gradual, return, process, that, extended, into, the, late, 6th, and, early, 5th, centuries, bce, the, population, of, persian, judah, was, greatly, reduced, from, that, of, the, kingdom, archaeological, surveys, showing, a, population, of, around, 30, 000, people, in, the, 5th, to, 4th, centuries, bce, 308, the, final, torah, is, widely, seen, as, a, product, of, the, persian, period, 539, 333, bce, probably, 450, 350, bce, this, consensus, echoes, a, traditional, jewish, view, which, gives, ezra, the, leader, of, the, jewish, community, on, its, return, from, babylon, a, pivotal, role, in, its, promulgation, three, prophets, considered, the, last, in, jewish, tradition, haggai, zechariah, and, malachi, were, active, during, this, period, after, the, death, of, the, last, jewish, prophet, and, while, still, under, persian, rule, the, leadership, of, the, jewish, people, passed, into, the, hands, of, five, successive, generations, of, zugot, pairs, of, leaders, they, flourished, first, under, the, persians, and, then, under, the, greeks, as, a, result, the, pharisees, and, sadducees, were, formed, under, the, persians, then, under, the, greeks, jewish, coins, were, minted, in, judea, as, yehud, coinage, in, 332, bce, alexander, the, great, of, macedon, defeated, the, persians, after, alexander, s, death, and, the, division, of, his, empire, among, his, generals, the, seleucid, kingdom, was, formed, the, alexandrian, conquests, spread, greek, culture, to, the, levant, during, this, time, currents, of, judaism, were, influenced, by, hellenistic, philosophy, developed, from, the, 3rd, century, bce, notably, the, jewish, diaspora, in, alexandria, culminating, in, the, compilation, of, the, septuagint, an, important, advocate, of, the, symbiosis, of, jewish, theology, and, hellenistic, thought, is, philo, triggered, by, anti, jewish, decrees, from, seleucid, king, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, and, tensions, between, hellenized, and, conservative, jews, the, maccabean, revolt, erupted, in, judea, in, 167, bce, under, the, leadership, of, mattathias, his, son, judas, maccabeus, recaptured, jerusalem, in, 164, bce, purifying, the, second, temple, and, reinstating, sacrificial, worship, the, successful, revolt, eventually, led, to, the, formation, of, an, independent, jewish, state, under, the, hasmonean, dynasty, which, lasted, from, 165, bce, to, 63, bce, initially, governing, as, both, political, leaders, and, high, priests, the, hasmoneans, later, assumed, the, title, of, kings, they, employed, military, campaigns, and, diplomacy, to, consolidate, power, under, the, rule, of, alexander, jannaeus, and, salome, alexandra, the, kingdom, reached, its, zenith, in, size, and, influence, however, internal, strife, erupted, between, salome, alexandra, s, sons, hyrcanus, ii, and, aristobulus, ii, leading, to, civil, war, and, appeals, to, roman, authorities, for, intervention, responding, to, these, appeals, pompey, led, a, roman, campaign, of, conquest, and, annexation, which, marked, the, end, of, hasmonean, sovereignty, and, ushered, in, roman, rule, over, judea, judea, had, been, an, independent, jewish, kingdom, under, the, hasmoneans, but, it, was, conquered, and, reorganized, as, a, client, state, by, the, roman, general, pompey, in, 63, bce, roman, expansion, was, going, on, in, other, areas, as, well, and, it, would, continue, for, more, than, a, hundred, and, fifty, years, later, herod, the, great, was, appointed, king, of, the, jews, by, the, roman, senate, supplanting, the, hasmonean, dynasty, some, of, his, offspring, held, various, positions, after, him, known, as, the, herodian, dynasty, briefly, from, 4, bce, to,

confiscation, of, jewish, owned, land, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, marked, a, cataclysmic, event, in, jewish, history, triggering, far, reaching, transformations, within, judaism, with, the, central, role, of, sacrificial, worship, obliterated, religious, practices, shifted, towards, prayer, torah, study, and, communal, gatherings, in, synagogues, according, to, rabbinic, tradition, yohanan, ben, zakkai, secured, permission, from, the, romans, to, establish, a, center, for, torah, study, in, yavneh, which, then, served, as, a, focal, point, for, jewish, religious, and, cultural, life, for, a, generation, judaism, also, underwent, a, significant, shift, away, from, its, sectarian, divisions, the, sadducees, and, essenes, two, prominent, sects, in, the, late, second, temple, period, faded, into, obscurity, while, the, traditions, of, the, pharisees, including, their, halakhic, interpretations, the, centrality, of, the, oral, torah, and, belief, in, resurrection, became, the, foundation, of, rabbinic, judaism, the, jewish, diaspora, existed, well, before, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, in, 70, ce, and, had, been, ongoing, for, centuries, with, the, dispersal, driven, by, both, forced, expulsions, and, voluntary, migrations, in, mesopotamia, a, testimony, to, the, beginnings, of, the, jewish, community, can, be, found, in, joachin, s, ration, tablets, listing, provisions, allotted, to, the, exiled, judean, king, and, his, family, by, nebuchadnezzar, ii, and, further, evidence, are, the, al, yahudu, tablets, dated, to, the, 6th, 5th, centuries, bce, and, related, to, the, exiles, from, judea, arriving, after, the, destruction, of, the, first, temple, though, there, is, ample, evidence, for, the, presence, of, jews, in, babylonia, even, from, 626, bce, in, egypt, the, documents, from, elephantine, reveal, the, trials, of, a, community, founded, by, a, persian, jewish, garrison, at, two, fortresses, on, the, frontier, during, the, 5th, 4th, centuries, bce, and, according, to, josephus, the, jewish, community, in, alexandria, existed, since, the, founding, of, the, city, in, the, 4th, century, bce, by, alexander, the,

a, result, of, the, jewish, roman, wars, a, large, number, of, jews, were, taken, as, captives, sold, into, slavery, or, compelled, to, flee, from, the, regions, affected, by, the, wars, contributing, to, the, formation, and, expansion, of, jewish, communities, across, the, roman, empire, as, well, as, in, arabia, and, mesopotamia, jewish, communities, across, cyrenaica, cyprus, and, egypt, were, almost, entirely, obliterated, due, to, the, harsh, roman, response, to, the, diaspora, revolt, the, book, of, acts, in, the, new, testament, as, well, as, other, pauline, texts, make, frequent, reference, to, the, large, populations, of, hellenised, jews, in, the, cities, of, the, roman, world, these, hellenised, jews, were, affected, by, the, diaspora, only, in, its, spiritual, sense, absorbing, the, feeling, of, loss, and, homelessness, that, became, a, cornerstone, of, the, jewish, creed, much, supported, by, persecutions, in, various, parts, of, the, world, of, critical,

widespread, rebellion, driven, by, messianic, fervor, and, hopes, for, the, ingathering, of, exiles, and, the, reconstruction, of, the, temple, these, communities, may, have, sought, to, spark, a, broader, movement, possibly, aimed, at, returning, to, judea, and, rebuilding, jerusalem, ancient, sources, describe, the, revolt, as, extremely, brutal, with, cases, of, cannibalism, and, mutilation, though, modern, scholars, often, consider, these, accounts, to, be, exaggerated, the, roman, suppression, of, the, revolt, was, marked, by, severe, measures, including, ethnic, cleansing, leading, to, the, near, total, destruction, of, jewish, diaspora, communities, in, libya, cyprus, and, egypt, including, the, significant, and, influential, community, in, alexandria, from, 132, to, 136, ce,

proclaimed, freedom, of, israel, and, for, the, freedom, of, jerusalem, using, ancient, hebrew, script, for, nationalistic, symbolism, however, the, romans, soon, amassed, six, legions, and, additional, auxiliaries, under, julius, severus, who, then, brutally, crushed, the, uprising, historical, accounts, report, the, destruction, of, fifty, major, strongholds, and, 985, villages,

prohibited, from, entering, jerusalem, and, hadrian, issued, religious, edicts, including, a, ban, on, circumcision, later, repealed, by, antoninus, pius, the, province, of, judaea, was, renamed, syria, palaestina, as, a, punitive, act, against, the, jews, aimed, at, placating, non, jewish, residents, and, erasing, jewish, historical, ties, to, the, land, the, relations, of, the, jews, with, the, roman, empire, in, the, region, continued, to, be, complicated, constantine, i, allowed, jews, to, mourn, their, defeat, and, humiliation, once, a, year, on, tisha, b, av, at, the, western, wall,

eastern, roman, empire, under, the, constantinian, dynasty, in, 355, however, the, relations, with, the, roman, rulers, improved, upon, the, rise, of, emperor, julian, the, last, of, the, constantinian, dynasty, who, unlike, his, predecessors, defied, christianity, in, 363, not, long, before, julian, left, antioch, to, launch, his, campaign, against, sasanian, persia, in, keeping, with, his, effort, to, foster, religions, other, than, christianity, he, ordered, the, jewish, temple, rebuilt, the, failure, to, rebuild, the, temple, has, mostly, been, ascribed, to, the, dramatic, galilee, earthquake, of, 363, and, traditionally, also, to, the, jews, ambivalence, about, the, project, sabotage, is, a, possibility, as, is, an, accidental, fire, divine, intervention, was, the, common, view, among, christian, historians, of, the, time, julian, s, support, of, jews, caused, jews, to, call, him, julian, the, hellene, julian, s, fatal, wound, in, the, persian, campaign, and, his, consequent, death, had, put, an, end, to, jewish, aspirations, and, julian, s, successors, embraced, christianity, through, the, entire, timeline, of, byzantine, rule, of, jerusalem, preventing, any, jewish, claims, in, 438, ce, when, the, empress, eudocia, removed, the, ban, on, jews, praying, at, the, temple, site, the, heads, of, the, community, in, galilee, issued, a, call, to, the, great, and, mighty, people, of, the, jews, which, began, know, that, the, end, of, the, exile, of, our, people, has, come, however, the, christian, population, of, the, city, who, saw, this, as, a, threat, to, their, primacy, did, not, allow, it, and, a, riot, erupted, after, which, they, chased, away, the, jews, from, the, city, during, the, 5th, and, the, 6th, centuries, a, series, of, samaritan, insurrections, broke, out, across, the, palaestina, prima, province, especially, violent, were, the, third, and, the, fourth, revolts, which, resulted, in, almost, the, entire, annihilation, of, the, samaritan, community, it, is, likely, that, the, samaritan, revolt, of, 556, was, joined, by, the, jewish, community, which, had, also, suffered, a, brutal, suppression, of, israelite, religion, in, the, belief, of, restoration, to, come, in, the, early, 7th, century, the, jews, made, an, alliance, with, the, persians, who, invaded, palaestina, prima, in, 614, fought, at, their, side, overwhelmed, the, byzantine, garrison, in, jerusalem, and, were, given, jerusalem, to, be, governed, as, an, autonomy, however, their, autonomy, was, brief, the, jewish, leader, in, jerusalem, was, shortly, assassinated, during, a, christian, revolt, and, though, jerusalem, was, reconquered, by, persians, and, jews, within, 3, weeks, it, fell, into, anarchy, with, the, consequent, withdrawal, of, persian, forces, jews, surrendered, to, byzantines, in, 625, or, 628, ce, but, were, massacred, by, christian, radicals, in, 629, ce, with, the, survivors, fleeing, to,

akko, after, the, fall, of, jerusalem, babylonia, modern, day, iraq, would, become, the, focus, of, judaism, for, more, than, a, thousand, years, the, first, jewish, communities, in, babylonia, started, with, the, exile, of, the, tribe, of, judah, to, babylon, by, jehoiachin, in, 597, bce, as, well, as, after, the, destruction, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, in, 586, bce, many, more, jews, migrated, to, babylon, in, 135, ce, after, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, and, in, the, centuries, after, babylonia, where, some, of, the, largest, and, most, prominent, jewish, cities, and, communities, were, established, became, the, centre, of, jewish, life, all, the, way, up, to, the, 13th, century, by, the, first, century, babylonia, already, held, a, speedily, growing, population, of, an, estimated, 1, 000, 000, jews, which, increased, to, an, estimated, 2, million, between, the, years, 200, ce, and, 500, ce, both, by, natural, growth, and, by, immigration, of, more, jews, from, judea, making, up, about, 1, 6, of, the, world, jewish, population, at, that, era, it, was, there, that, they, would, write, the, babylonian, talmud, in, the, languages, used, by, the, jews, of, ancient, babylonia, hebrew, and, aramaic, the, jews, established, talmudic, academies, in, babylonia, also, known, as, the, geonic, academies, geonim, meaning, splendour, in, biblical, hebrew, or, geniuses, which, became, the, centre, for, jewish, scholarship, and, the, development, of, jewish, law, in, babylonia, from, roughly, 500, ce, to, 1038, ce, the, two, most, famous, academies, were, the, pumbedita, academy, and, the, sura, academy, major, yeshivot, were, also, located, at, nehardea, and, mahuza, the, talmudic, yeshiva, academies, became, a, main, part, of, jewish, culture, and, education, and, jews, continued, establishing, yeshiva, academies, in, western, and, eastern, europe, north, africa, and, in, later, centuries, in, america, and, other, countries, around, the, world, where, jews, lived, in, the, diaspora, talmudic, study, in, yeshiva, academies, most, of, them, located, in, the, united, states, and, israel, continues, today, these, talmudic, yeshiva, academies, of, babylonia, followed, the, era, of, the, amoraim, expounders, the, sages, of, the, talmud, who, were, active, both, in, judah, and, in, babylon, during, the, end, of, the, era, of, the, sealing, of, the, mishnah, and, until, the, times, of, the, sealing, of, the, talmud, 220ce, 500ce, and, following, the, savoraim, reasoners, the, sages, of, beth, midrash, torah, study, places, in, babylon,

colleges, of, sura, and, pumbedita, and, were, the, generally, accepted, spiritual, leaders, of, the, worldwide, jewish, community, in, the, early, medieval, era, in, contrast, to, the, resh, galuta, exilarch, who, wielded, secular, authority, over, the, jews, in, islamic, lands, according, to, traditions, the, resh, galuta, were, descendants, of, judean, kings, which, is, why, the, kings, of, parthia, would, treat, them, with, much, honour, for, the, jews, of, late, antiquity, and, the, early, middle, ages, the, yeshivot, of, babylonia, served, much, the, same, function, as, the, ancient, sanhedrin, that, is, as, a, council, of, jewish, religious, authorities, the, academies, were, founded, in, pre, islamic, babylonia, under, the, zoroastrian, sassanid, dynasty, and, were, located, not, far, from, the, sassanid, capital, of, ctesiphon, which, at, that, time, was, the, largest, city, in, the, world, after, the, conquest, of, persia, in, the, 7th, century, the, academies, subsequently, operated, for, four, hundred, years, under, the, islamic, caliphate, the, first, gaon, of, sura, according, to, sherira, gaon, was, mar, bar, rab, chanan, who, assumed, office, in, 609, the, last, gaon, of, sura, was, samuel, ben, hofni, who, died, in, 1034, the, last, gaon, of, pumbedita, was, hezekiah, gaon, who, was, tortured, to, death, in, 1040, hence, the, activity, of, the, geonim, covers, a, period, of, nearly, 450, years, one, of, principal, seats, of, babylonian, judaism, was, nehardea, which, was, then, a, very, large, city, made, up, mostly, of, jews, a, very, ancient, synagogue, built, it, was, believed, by, king, jehoiachin, existed, in, nehardea, at, huzal, near, nehardea, there, was, another, synagogue, not, far, from, which, could, be, seen, the, ruins, of, ezra, s, academy, in, the, period, before, hadrian, akiba, on, his, arrival, at, nehardea, on, a, mission, from, the, sanhedrin, entered, into, a, discussion, with, a, resident, scholar, on, a, point, of, matrimonial, law, mishnah, yeb, end, at, the, same, time, there, was, at, nisibis, northern, mesopotamia, an, excellent, jewish, college, at, the, head, of, which, stood, judah, ben, bathyra, and, in, which, many, judean, scholars, found, refuge, at, the, time, of, the, persecutions, a, certain, temporary, importance, was, also, attained, by, a, school, at, nehar, pekod, founded, by, the, judean, immigrant, hananiah, nephew, of, joshua, ben, hananiah, which, school, might, have, been, the, cause, of, a, schism, between, the, jews, of, babylonia, and, those, of, judea, israel, had, not, the, judean, authorities, promptly, checked, hananiah, s, ambition, jews, were, also, widespread, throughout, the, roman, empire, and, this, carried, on, to, a, lesser, extent, in, the, period, of, byzantine, rule, in, the, central, and, eastern, mediterranean, the, militant, and, exclusive, christianity, and, caesaropapism, of, the, byzantine, empire, did, not, treat, jews, well, and, the, condition, and, influence, of, diaspora, jews, in, the, empire, declined, dramatically, it, was, official, christian, policy, to, convert, jews, to, christianity, and, the, christian, leadership, used, the, official, power, of, rome, in, their, attempts, in, 351, ce, the, jews, revolted, against, the, added, pressures, of, their, governor, constantius, gallus, gallus, put, down, the, revolt, and, destroyed, the, major, cities, in, the, galilee, area, where, the, revolt, had, started, tzippori, and, lydda, site, of, two, of, the, major, legal, academies, never, recovered, in, this, period, the, nasi, in, tiberias, hillel, ii, created, an, official, calendar, which, needed, no, monthly, sightings, of, the, moon, the, months, were, set, and, the, calendar, needed, no, further, authority, from, judea, at, about, the, same, time, the, jewish, academy, at, tiberius, began, to, collate, the, combined, mishnah, braitot, explanations, and, interpretations, developed, by, generations, of, scholars, who, studied, after, the, death, of, judah, hanasi, the, text, was, organized, according, to, the, order, of, the, mishna, each, paragraph, of, mishnah, was, followed, by, a, compilation, of, all, of, the, interpretations, stories, and, responses, associated, with, that, mishnah, this, text, is, called, the, jerusalem, talmud, the, jews, of, judea, received, a, brief, respite, from, official, persecution, during, the, rule, of, the, emperor, julian, the, apostate, julian, s, policy, was, to, return, the, roman, empire, to, hellenism, and, he, encouraged, the, jews, to, rebuild, jerusalem, as, julian, s, rule, lasted, only, from, 361, to, 363, the, jews, could, not, rebuild, sufficiently, before, roman, christian, rule, was, restored, over, the, empire, beginning, in, 398, with, the, consecration, of, st, john, chrysostom, as, patriarch, christian, rhetoric, against, jews, grew, sharper, he, preached, sermons, with, titles, such, as, against, the, jews, and, on, the, statues, homily, 17, in, which, john, preaches, against, the, jewish, sickness, such, heated, language, contributed, to, a, climate, of, christian, distrust, and, hate, toward, the, large, jewish, settlements, such, as, those, in, antioch, and, constantinople, in, the, beginning, of, the, 5th, century, the, emperor, theodosius, issued, a, set, of, decrees, establishing, official, persecution, of, jews, jews, were, not, allowed, to, own, slaves, build, new, synagogues, hold, public, office, or, try, cases, between, a, jew, and, a, non, jew, intermarriage, between, jew, and, non, jew, was, made, a, capital, offence, as, was, the, conversion, of, christians, to, judaism, theodosius, did, away, with, the, sanhedrin, and, abolished, the, post, of, nasi, under, the, emperor, justinian, the, authorities, further, restricted, the, civil, rights, of, jews, and, threatened, their, religious, privileges, the, emperor, interfered, in, the, internal, affairs, of, the, synagogue, and, forbade, for, instance, the, use, of, the, hebrew, language, in, divine, worship, those, who, disobeyed, the, restrictions, were, threatened, with, corporal, penalties, exile, and, loss, of, property, the, jews, at, borium, not, far, from, syrtis, major, who, resisted, the, byzantine, general, belisarius, in, his, campaign, against, the, vandals, were, forced, to, embrace, christianity, and, their, synagogue, was, converted, to, a, church, justinian, and, his, successors, had, concerns, outside, the, province, of, judea, and, he, had, insufficient, troops, to, enforce, these, regulations, as, a, result, the, 5th, century, was, a, period, when, a, wave, of, new, synagogues, were, built, many, with, beautiful, mosaic, floors, jews, adopted, the, rich, art, forms, of, the, byzantine, culture, jewish, mosaics, of, the, period, portray, people, animals, menorahs, zodiacs, and, biblical, characters, excellent, examples, of, these, synagogue, floors, have, been, found, at, beit, alpha, which, includes, the, scene, of, abraham, sacrificing, a, ram, instead, of, his, son, isaac, along, with, a, zodiac, tiberius, beit, shean, and, tzippori, the, precarious, existence, of, jews, under, byzantine, rule, did, not, long, endure, largely, due, to, the, explosion, of, the, muslim, religion, out, of, the, remote, arabian, peninsula, where, large, populations, of, jews,

caliphate, over, the, subsequent, centuries, the, size, of, the, jewish, community, in, the, byzantine, empire, was, not, affected, by, attempts, by, some, emperors, most, notably, justinian, to, forcibly, convert, the, jews, of, anatolia, to, christianity, as, these, attempts, met, with, very, little, success, historians, continue, to, research, the, status, of, the, jews, in, asia, minor, under, byzantine, rule, for, a, sample, of, views, see, for, instance, j, starr, the, jews, in, the, byzantine, empire, 641, 1204, s, bowman, the, jews, of, byzantium, r, jenkins, byzantium, averil,

by, mehmet, ii, cochin, jewish, tradition, holds, that, the, roots, of, their, community, go, back, to, the, arrival, of, jews, at, shingly, in, 72, ce, after, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, it, also, states, that, a, jewish, kingdom, understood, to, mean, the, granting, of, autonomy, by, a, local, king, cheraman, perumal, to, the, community, under, their, leader, joseph, rabban, in, 379, ce, the, first, synagogue, there, was, built, in, 1568, the, legend, of, the, founding, of, indian, christianity, in, kerala, by, thomas, the, apostle, relates, that, on, his, arrival, there, he, encountered, a, local, girl, who, understood, hebrew, perhaps, in, the, 4th, century, the, kingdom, of, semien, a, jewish, nation, in, modern, ethiopia, was, established, lasting, until, the, 17th, century, in, 638, ce, the, byzantine, empire, lost, control, of, the, levant, the, arab, islamic, empire, under, caliph, omar, conquered, jerusalem, and, the, lands, of, mesopotamia, syria, palestine, and, egypt, as, a, political, system, islam, created, radically, new, conditions, for, jewish, economic, social, and, intellectual, development, caliph, omar, permitted, the, jews, to, reestablish, their, presence, in, jerusalem, after, a, lapse, of, 500, years, jewish, tradition, regards, caliph, omar, as, a, benevolent, ruler, and, the, midrash, nistarot, de, rav, shimon, bar, yo,

from, the, countryside, to, cities, like, baghdad, this, in, turn, led, to, greater, wealth, and, international, influence, as, well, as, a, more, cosmopolitan, outlook, from, jewish, thinkers, such, as, saadiah, gaon, who, now, deeply, engaged, with, western, philosophy, for, the, first, time, when, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, the, city, of, baghdad, declined, in, the, 10th, century, many,

their, midst, to, avenge, the, crucifixion, of, christ, the, massacres, began, at, rouen, and, jewish, communities, in, rhine, valley, were, seriously, affected, crusading, attacks, were, made, upon, jews, in, the, territory, around, heidelberg, a, huge, loss, of, jewish, life, took, place, many, were, forcibly, converted, to, christianity, and, many, committed, suicide, to, avoid, baptism, a, major, driving, factor, behind, the, choice, to, commit, suicide, was, the, jewish, realisation, that, upon, being, slain, their, children, could, be, taken, to, be, raised, as, christians, the, jews, were, living, in, the, middle, of, christian, lands, and, felt, this, danger, acutely, this, massacre, is, seen, as, the, first, in, a, sequence, of, antisemitic, events, which, culminated, in, the, holocaust, jewish, populations, felt, that, they, had, been, abandoned, by, their, christian, neighbours, and, rulers, during, the, massacres, and, lost, faith, in, all, promises, and, charters, many, jews, chose, self, defence, but, their, means, of, self, defence, were, limited, and, their, casualties, only, increased, most, of, the, forced, conversions, proved, ineffective, many, jews, reverted, to, their, original, faith, later, the, pope, protested, this, but, emperor, henry, iv, agreed, to, permitting, these, reversions, the, massacres, began, a, new, epoch, for, jewry, in, christendom, the, jews, had, preserved, their, faith, from, social, pressure, now, they, had, to, preserve, it, at, sword, point, the, massacres, during, the, crusades, strengthened, jewry, from, within,

crusaders, when, the, city, fell, the, crusaders, gathered, many, jews, in, a, synagogue, and, set, it, on, fire, in, haifa, the, jews, almost, single, handedly, defended, the, town, against, the, crusaders, holding, out, for, a, month, june, july, 1099, at, this, time, there, were, jewish, communities, scattered, all, over, the, country, including, jerusalem, tiberias, ramleh, ashkelon, caesarea, and, gaza, as, jews, were, not, allowed, to, hold, land, during, the, crusader, period, they, worked, at, trades, and, commerce, in, the, coastal, towns, during, times, of, quiescence, most, were, artisans, glassblowers, in, sidon, furriers, and, dyers, in, jerusalem, during, this, period, the, masoretes, of, tiberias, established, the, niqqud, a, system, of, diacritical, signs, used, to,

from, c, rdoba, he, arrived, in, egyptian, alexandria, where, he, was, enthusiastically, greeted, by, friends, and, admirers, at, damietta, he, had, to, struggle, against, his, heart, and, the, pleadings, of, his, friend, alfon, ha, levi, that, he, remain, in, egypt, where, he, would, be, free, from, intolerant, oppression, he, started, on, the, rough, route, overland, he, was, met, along, the, way, by, jews, in, tyre, and, damascus, jewish, legend, relates, that, as, he, came, near, jerusalem, overpowered, by, the, sight, of, the, holy, city, he, sang, his, most, beautiful, elegy, the,

among, them, aaron, ben, joseph, the, elder, he, later, became, one, of, the, greatest, karaite, authorities, shortly, after, nahmanides, arrival, in, jerusalem, he, addressed, a, letter, to, his, son, nahman, in, which, he, described, the, desolation, of, the, holy, city, at, the, time, it, had, only, two, jewish, inhabitants, two, brothers, dyers, by, trade, in, a, later, letter, from, acre, nahmanides, counsels, his, son, to, cultivate, humility, which, he, considers, to, be, the, first, of, virtues, in, another, addressed, to, his, second, son, who, occupied, an, official, position, at,

arrived, in, jerusalem, this, marked, a, new, period, of, return, for, the, jewish, community, in, the, land, during, the, middle, ages, jews, were, generally, better, treated, by, islamic, rulers, than, christian, ones, despite, second, class, citizenship, jews, played, prominent, roles, in, muslim, courts, and, experienced, a, golden, age, in, moorish, spain, about, 900, 1100, though, the, situation, deteriorated, after, that, time, riots, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, jews, did, however, occur, in, north, africa, through, the, centuries, and, especially, in, morocco, libya, and, algeria, where, eventually, jews, were, forced, to, live, in, ghettos, during, the, 11th, century, muslims, in, spain, conducted, pogroms, against, the, jews, those, occurred, in, cordoba, in, 1011, and, in, granada, in, 1066, during, the, middle, ages, the, governments, of, egypt, syria, iraq, and, yemen, enacted, decrees, ordering, the, destruction, of, synagogues, at, certain, times, jews, were, forced, to, convert, to, islam, or, face, death, in, some, parts, of, yemen, morocco, and, baghdad, the, almohads, who, had, taken, control, of, much, of, islamic, iberia, by, 1172, surpassed, the, almoravides, in, fundamentalist, outlook, they, treated, the, dhimmis, harshly, they, expelled, both, jews, and, christians, from, morocco, and, islamic, spain, faced, with, the, choice, of, death, or, conversion, many, jews, emigrated, some, such, as, the, family, of, maimonides, fled, south, and, east, to, more, tolerant, muslim, lands, while, others, went, northward, to, settle, in, the, growing, christian, kingdoms, according, to, the, american, writer, james, carroll, jews, accounted, for, 10, of, the, total, population, of, the, roman, empire, by, that, ratio, if, other, factors, had, not, intervened, there, would, be, 200, million, jews, in, the, world, today, instead, of, something, like, 13, million, jewish, populations, have, existed, in, europe, especially, in, the, area, of, the, former, roman, empire, from, very, early, times, as, jewish, males, had, emigrated, some, sometimes, took, wives, from, local, populations, as, is, shown, by, the, various, mtdna, compared, to, y, dna, among, jewish, populations, these, groups, were, joined, by, traders, and, later, on, by, members, of, the, diaspora, records, of, jewish, communities, in, france, see, history, of, the, jews, in, france, and, germany, see, history, of, the, jews, in, germany, date, from, the, 4th, century, and, substantial, jewish, communities, in, spain, were, noted, even, earlier, the, historian, norman, cantor, and, other, 20th, century, scholars, dispute, the, tradition, that, the, middle, ages, was, a, uniformly, difficult, time, for, jews, before, the, church, became, fully, organized, as, an, institution, with, an, increasing, array, of, rules, early, medieval, society, was, tolerant, between, 800, and, 1100, an, estimated, 1, 5, million, jews, lived, in, christian, europe, as, they, were, not, christians, they, were, not, included, as, a, division, of, the, feudal, system, of, clergy, knights, and, serfs, this, means, that, they, did, not, have, to, satisfy, the, oppressive, demands, for, labor, and, military, conscription, that, christian, commoners, suffered, in, relations, with, the, christian, society, the, jews, were, protected, by, kings, princes, and, bishops, because, of, the, crucial, services, they, provided, in, three, areas, finance, administration, and, medicine, the, lack, of, political, strengths, did, leave, jews, vulnerable, to, exploitation, through, extreme, taxation, christian, scholars, interested, in, the, bible, consulted, with, talmudic, rabbis, as, the, roman, catholic, church, strengthened, as, an, institution, the, franciscan, and, dominican, preaching, orders, were, founded, and, there, was, a, rise, of, competitive, middle, class, town, dwelling, christians, by, 1300, the, friars, and, local, priests, staged, the, passion, plays, during, holy, week, which, depicted, jews, in, contemporary, dress, killing, christ, according, to, gospel, accounts, from, this, period, persecution, of, jews, and, deportations, became, endemic, around, 1500, jews, found, relative, security, and, a, renewal, of, prosperity, in, present, day, poland, after, 1300, jews, suffered, more, discrimination, and, persecution, in, christian, europe, europe, s, jewry, was, mainly, urban, and, literate, the, christians, were, inclined, to, regard, jews, as, obstinate, deniers, of, the, truth, because, in, their, view, the, jews, were, expected, to, know, of, the, truth, of, the, christian, doctrines, from, their, knowledge, of, the, jewish, scriptures, jews, were, aware, of, the, pressure, to, accept, christianity, as, catholics, were, forbidden, by, the, church, to, loan, money, for, interest, some, jews, became, prominent, moneylenders, christian, rulers, gradually, saw, the, advantage, of, having, such, a, class, of, people, who, could, supply, capital, for, their, use, without, being, liable, to, excommunication, as, a, result, the, money, trade, of, western, europe, became, a, specialty, of, the, jews, but, in, almost, every, instance, when, jews, acquired, large, amounts, through, banking, transactions, during, their, lives, or, upon, their, deaths, the, king, would, take, it, over, jews, became, imperial, servi, camer, the, property, of, the, king, who, might, present, them, and, their, possessions, to, princes, or, cities, jews, were, frequently, massacred, and, exiled, from, various, european, countries, the, persecution, hit, its, first, peak, during, the, crusades, in, the, people, s, crusade, 1096, flourishing, jewish, communities, on, the, rhine, and, the, danube, were, utterly, destroyed, in, the, second, crusade, 1147, the, jews, in, france, were, subject, to, frequent, massacres, they, were, also, subjected, to, attacks, by, the, shepherds, crusades, of, 1251, and, 1320, the, crusades, were, followed, by, massive, expulsions, including, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, from, england, in, 1290, in, 1396, 100, 000, jews, were, expelled, from, france, and, in, 1421, thousands, were, expelled, from, austria, over, this, time, many, jews, in, europe, either, fleeing, or, being, expelled, migrated, to, poland, where, they, prospered, into, another, golden, age, in, italy, jews, were, allowed, to, live, in, venice, but, were, required, to, live, in, a, ghetto, and, the, practice, spread, across, italy, see, cum, nimis, absurdum, and, was, adopted, in, many, places, in, catholic, europe, jews, outside, the, ghetto, often, had, to, wear, a, yellow, star, significant, repression, of, spain, s, numerous, community, occurred, during, the, 14th, century, notably, a, major, pogrom, in, 1391, which, resulted, in, the, majority, of, spain, s, 300, 000, jews, converting, to, catholicism, with, the, conquest, of, the, muslim, kingdom, of, granada, in, 1492, the, catholic, monarchs, issued, the, alhambra, decree, and, spain, s, remaining, 100, 000, jews, were, forced, to, choose, between, conversion, and, exile, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, of, spain, is, regarded, by, jews, as, the, worst, catastrophe, between, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, in, 73, ce, and, the, holocaust, of, the, 1940s, as, a, result, an, estimated, 50, 000, to, 70, 000, jews, left, spain, the, remainder, joining, spain, s, already, numerous, converso, community, perhaps, a, quarter, of, a, million, conversos, thus, were, gradually, absorbed, by, the, dominant, catholic, culture, although, those, among, them, who, secretly, practiced, judaism, were, subject, to, 40, years, of, intense, repression, by, the, spanish, inquisition, this, was, particularly, the, case, up, until, 1530, after, which, the, trials, of, conversos, by, the, inquisition, dropped, to, 3, of, the, total, similar, expulsions, of, sephardic, jews, occurred, 1493, in, sicily, 37, 000, jews, and, portugal, in, 1496, the, expelled, spanish, jews, fled, mainly, to, the, ottoman, empire, and, north, africa, and, portugal, a, small, number, also, settled, in, holland, and, england, the, expulsion, followed, a, long, process, of, expulsions, and, bans, from, what, are, now, england, france, germany, austria, and, holland, in, january, 1492, the, last, muslim, state, was, defeated, in, spain, and, six, months, later, the, jews, of, spain, the, largest, community, in, the, world, were, required, to, convert, or, leave, without, their, property, 100, 000, converted, with, many, continuing, to, secretly, practice, judaism, for, which, the, catholic, church, s, inquisition, led, by, torquemada, now, mandated, a, sentence, of, death, by, public, burning, 175, 000, left, spain, many, spanish, jews, moved, to, north, africa, poland, and, the, ottoman, empire, especially, thessaloniki, now, in, greece, which, became, the, world, s, largest, jewish, city, some, groups, headed, to, the, middle, east, and, palestine, within, the, domains, of, the, ottoman, empire, about, 100, 000, spanish, jews, were, allowed, into, portugal, however, five, years, later, their, children, were, seized, and, they, were, given, the, choice, of, conversion, or, departing, without, them, historians, who, study, modern, jewry, have, identified, four, different, paths, by, which, european, jews, were, modernized, and, thus, integrated, into, the, mainstream, of, european, society, a, common, approach, has, been, to, view, the, process, through, the, lens, of, the, european, enlightenment, as, jews, faced, the, promise, and, the, challenges, posed, by, political, emancipation, scholars, that, use, this, approach, have, focused, on, two, social, types, as, paradigms, for, the, decline, of, jewish, tradition, and, as, agents, of, the, sea, changes, in, jewish, culture, that, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, ghetto, the, first, of, these, two, social, types, is, the, court, jew, who, is, portrayed, as, a, forerunner, of, the, modern, jew, having, achieved, integration, with, and, participation, in, the, proto, capitalist, economy, and, court, society, of, central, european, states, such, as, the, habsburg, empire, in, contrast, to, the, cosmopolitan, court, jew, the, second, social, type, presented, by, historians, of, modern, jewry, is, the, maskil, learned, person, a, proponent, of, the, haskalah, enlightenment, this, narrative, sees, the, maskil, s, pursuit, of, secular, scholarship, and, his, rationalistic, critiques, of, rabbinic, tradition, as, laying, a, durable, intellectual, foundation, for, the, secularization, of, jewish, society, and, culture, the, established, paradigm, has, been, one, in, which, ashkenazic, jews, entered, modernity, through, a, self, conscious, process, of, westernization, led, by, highly, atypical, germanized, jewish, intellectuals, haskalah, gave, birth, to, the, reform, and, conservative, movements, and, planted, the, seeds, of, zionism, while, at, the, same, time, encouraging, cultural, assimilation, into, the, countries, in, which, jews, resided, at, around, the, same, time, that, haskalah, was, developing, hasidic, judaism, was, spreading, as, a, movement, that, preached, a, world, view, nearly, opposed, to, the, haskalah, in, the, 1990s, the, concept, of, the, port, jew, has, been, suggested, as, an, alternate, path, to, modernity, that, was, distinct, from, the, european, haskalah, in, contrast, to, the, focus, on, ashkenazic, germanized, jews, the, concept, of, the, port, jew, focused, on, the, sephardi, conversos, who, fled, the, inquisition, and, resettled, in, european, port, towns, on, the, coast, of, the, mediterranean, the, atlantic, and, the, eastern, seaboard, of, the, united, states, court, jews, were, jewish, bankers, or, businessmen, who, lent, money, and, handled, the, finances, of, some, of, the, christian, european, noble, houses, corresponding, historical, terms, are, jewish, bailiff, and, shtadlan, examples, of, what, would, be, later, called, court, jews, emerged, when, local, rulers, used, services, of, jewish, bankers, for, short, term, loans, they, lent, money, to, nobles, and, in, the, process, gained, social, influence, noble, patrons, of, court, jews, employed, them, as, financiers, suppliers, diplomats, and, trade, delegates, court, jews, could, use, their, family, connections, and, connections, between, each, other, to, provision, their, sponsors, with, among, other, things, food, arms, ammunition, and, precious, metals, in, return, for, their, services, court, jews, gained, social, privileges, including, up, to, noble, status, for, themselves, and, could, live, outside, the, jewish, ghettos, some, nobles, wanted, to, keep, their, bankers, in, their, own, courts, and, because, they, were, under, noble, protection, they, were, exempted, from, rabbinical, jurisdiction, from, medieval, times, court, jews, could, amass, personal, fortunes, and, gained, political, and, social, influence, sometimes, they, were, also, prominent, people, in, the, local, jewish, community, and, could, use, their, influence, to, protect, and, influence, their, brethren, sometimes, they, were, the, only, jews, who, could, interact, with, the, local, high, society, and, present, petitions, of, the, jews, to, the, ruler, however, the, court, jew, had, social, connections, and, influence, in, the, christian, world, mainly, through, his, christian, patrons, due, to, the, precarious, position, of, jews, some, nobles, could, just, ignore, their, debts, if, the, sponsoring, noble, died, his, jewish, financier, could, face, exile, or, execution, the, port, jew, is, a, descriptive, term, for, jews, who, were, involved, in, the, seafaring, and, maritime, economy, of, europe, especially, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, helen, fry, suggests, that, they, can, be, considered, the, earliest, modern, jews, according, to, fry, port, jews, frequently, arrived, as, refugees, from, the, inquisition, and, the, expulsion, of, jews, from, iberia, they, were, allowed, to, settle, in, port, cities, because, merchants, granted, them, permission, to, trade, in, ports, such, as, amsterdam, london, trieste, and, hamburg, fry, notes, that, their, connections, to, the, jewish, diaspora, and, their, expertise, in, maritime, trade, made, them, particularly, valuable, to, the, mercantilist, governments, of, europe, lois, dubin, describes, port, jews, as, jewish, merchants, who, were, valued, for, their, engagement, in, the, international, maritime, trade, upon, which, such, cities, thrived, sorkin, and, others, have, characterized, the, socio, cultural, profile, of, these, men, as, marked, by, a, flexibility, towards, religion, and, a, reluctant, cosmopolitanism, that, was, alien, to, both, traditional, and, enlightened, jewish, identities, from, the, 16th, to, the, 18th, century, jewish, merchants, dominated, the, chocolate, and, vanilla, trade, exporting, to, jewish, centres, across, europe, mainly, amsterdam, bayonne, bordeaux, hamburg, and, livorno, during, the, classical, ottoman, period, 1300, 1600, the, jews, together, with, most, other, communities, of, the, empire, enjoyed, a, certain, level, of, prosperity, compared, with, other, ottoman, subjects, they, were, the, predominant, power, in, commerce, and, trade, as, well, in, diplomacy, and, other, high, offices, in, the, 16th, century, especially, the, jews, were, the, most, prominent, under, the, millets, the, apogee, of, jewish, influence, could, arguably, be, the, appointment, of, joseph, nasi, to, sanjak, bey, governor, a, rank, usually, only, bestowed, upon, muslims, of, the, island, of, naxos, at, the, time, of, the, battle, of, yarmuk, when, the, levant, passed, under, muslim, rule, thirty, jewish, communities, existed, in, haifa, sh, chem, hebron, ramleh, gaza, jerusalem, and, many, in, the, north, safed, became, a, spiritual, centre, for, the, jews, and, the, shulchan, aruch, was, compiled, there, as, well, as, many, kabbalistic, texts, the, first, hebrew, printing, press, and, the, first, printing, in, western, asia, began, in, 1577, jews, lived, in, the, geographic, area, of, asia, minor, modern, turkey, but, more, geographically, either, anatolia, or, asia, minor, for, more, than, 2, 400, years, initial, prosperity, in, hellenistic, times, had, faded, under, christian, byzantine, rule, but, recovered, somewhat, under, the, rule, of, the, various, muslim, governments, that, displaced, and, succeeded, rule, from, constantinople, for, much, of, the, ottoman, period, turkey, was, a, safe, haven, for, jews, fleeing, persecution, and, it, continues, to, have, a, small, jewish, population, today, the, situation, where, jews, both, enjoyed, cultural, and, economical, prosperity, at, times, but, were, widely, persecuted, at, other, times, was, summarised, by, g, e, von, grunebaum, it, would, not, be, difficult, to, put, together, the, names, of, a, very, sizeable, number, of, jewish, subjects, or, citizens, of, the, islamic, area, who, have, attained, to, high, rank, to, power, to, great, financial, influence, to, significant, and, recognized, intellectual, attainment, and, the, same, could, be, done, for, christians, but, it, would, again, not, be, difficult, to, compile, a, lengthy, list, of, persecutions, arbitrary, confiscations, attempted, forced, conversions, or, pogroms, in, the, 17th, century, there, were, many, significant, jewish, populations, in, western, and, central, europe, the, relatively, tolerant, poland, had, the, largest, jewish, population, in, europe, that, dated, back, to, 13th, century, and, enjoyed, relative, prosperity, and, freedom, for, nearly, four, hundred, years, however, the, calm, situation, ended, when, polish, and, lithuanian, jews, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, were, slaughtered, in, the, hundreds, of, thousands, by, ukrainian, cossacks, during, the, khmelnytsky, uprising, 1648, and, by, the, swedish, wars, 1655, driven, by, these, and, other, persecutions, some, jews, moved, back, to, western, europe, in, the, 17th, century, notably, to, amsterdam, the, last, ban, on, jewish, residency, in, a, european, nation, was, revoked, in, 1654, but, periodic, expulsions, from, individual, cities, still, occurred, and, jews, were, often, restricted, from, land, ownership, or, forced, to, live, in, ghettos, with, the, partitions, of, poland, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, polish, jewish, population, was, split, between, the, russian, empire, austria, hungary, and, german, prussia, which, divided, poland, among, themselves, during, the, period, of, the, european, renaissance, and, enlightenment, significant, changes, occurred, within, the, jewish, community, the, haskalah, movement, paralleled, the, wider, enlightenment, as, jews, in, the, 18th, century, began, to, campaign, for, emancipation, from, restrictive, laws, and, integration, into, the, wider, european, society, secular, and, scientific, education, was, added, to, the, traditional, religious, instruction, received, by, students, and, interest, in, a, national, jewish, identity, including, a, revival, in, the, study, of, jewish, history, and, hebrew, started, to, grow, haskalah, gave, birth, to, the, reform, and, conservative, movements, and, planted, the, seeds, of, zionism, while, at, the, same, time, encouraging, cultural, assimilation, into, the, countries, in, which, jews, resided, at, around, the, same, time, another, movement, was, born, one, preaching, almost, the, opposite, of, haskalah, hasidic, judaism, hasidic, judaism, began, in, the, 18th, century, by, rabbi, israel, baal, shem, tov, and, quickly, gained, a, following, with, its, more, exuberant, mystical, approach, to, religion, these, two, movements, and, the, traditional, orthodox, approach, to, judaism, from, which, they, spring, formed, the, basis, for, the, modern, divisions, within, jewish, observance, at, the, same, time, the, outside, world, was, changing, and, debates, began, over, the, potential, emancipation, of, the, jews, granting, them, equal, rights, the, first, country, to, do, so, was, france, during, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, even, so, jews, were, expected, to, assimilate, not, continue, their, traditions, this, ambivalence, is, demonstrated, in, the, famous, speech, of, clermont, tonnerre, before, the, national, assembly, in, 1789, we, must, refuse, everything, to, the, jews, as, a, nation, and, accord, everything, to, jews, as, individuals, we, must, withdraw, recognition, from, their, judges, they, should, only, have, our, judges, we, must, refuse, legal, protection, to, the, maintenance, of, the, so, called, laws, of, their, judaic, organization, they, should, not, be, allowed, to, form, in, the, state, either, a, political, body, or, an, order, they, must, be, citizens, individually, but, some, will, say, to, me, they, do, not, want, to, be, citizens, well, then, if, they, do, not, want, to, be, citizens, they, should, say, so, and, then, we, should, banish, them, it, is, repugnant, to, have, in, the, state, an, association, of, non, citizens, and, a, nation, within, the, nation, hasidic, judaism, is, a, branch, of, orthodox, judaism, that, promotes, spirituality, and, joy, through, the, popularisation, and, internalisation, of, jewish, mysticism, as, the, fundamental, aspects, of, the, jewish, faith, hasidism, comprises, part, of, contemporary, ultra, orthodox, judaism, alongside, the, previous, talmudic, lithuanian, yeshiva, approach, and, the, oriental, sephardi, tradition, it, was, founded, in, 18th, century, eastern, europe, by, rabbi, israel, baal, shem, tov, as, a, reaction, against, overly, legalistic, judaism, opposite, to, this, hasidic, teachings, cherished, the, sincerity, and, concealed, holiness, of, the, unlettered, common, folk, and, their, equality, with, the, scholarly, elite, the, emphasis, on, the, immanent, divine, presence, in, everything, gave, new, value, to, prayer, and, deeds, of, kindness, alongside, rabbinic, supremacy, of, study, and, replaced, historical, mystical, kabbalistic, and, ethical, musar, asceticism, and, admonishment, with, optimism, encouragement, and, daily, fervour, this, populist, emotional, revival, accompanied, the, elite, ideal, of, nullification, to, paradoxical, divine, panentheism, through, intellectual, articulation, of, inner, dimensions, of, mystical, thought, the, adjustment, of, jewish, values, sought, to, add, to, required, standards, of, ritual, observance, while, relaxing, others, where, inspiration, predominated, its, communal, gatherings, celebrate, soulful, song, and, storytelling, as, forms, of, mystical, devotion, though, persecution, still, existed, emancipation, spread, throughout, europe, in, the, 19th, century, napoleon, invited, jews, to, leave, the, jewish, ghettos, in, europe, and, seek, refuge, in, the, newly, created, tolerant, political, regimes, that, offered, equality, under, napoleonic, law, see, napoleon, and, the, jews, by, 1871, with, germany, s, emancipation, of, jews, every, european, country, except, russia, had, emancipated, its, jews, despite, increasing, integration, of, the, jews, with, secular, society, a, new, form, of, antisemitism, emerged, based, on, the, ideas, of, race, and, nationhood, rather, than, the, religious, hatred, of, the, middle, ages, this, form, of, antisemitism, held, that, jews, were, a, separate, and, inferior, race, from, the, aryan, people, of, western, europe, and, led, to, the, emergence, of, political, parties, in, france, germany, and, austria, hungary, that, campaigned, on, a, platform, of, rolling, back, emancipation, this, form, of, antisemitism, emerged, frequently, in, european, culture, most, famously, in, the, dreyfus, trial, in, france, these, persecutions, along, with, state, sponsored, pogroms, in, russia, in, the, late, 19th, century, led, a, number, of, jews, to, believe, that, they, would, only, be, safe, in, their, own, nation, see, theodor, herzl, and, history, of, zionism, during, this, period, jewish, migration, to, the, united, states, see, american, jews, created, a, large, new, community, mostly, freed, of, the, restrictions, of, europe, over, 2, million, jews, arrived, in, the, united, states, between, 1890, and, 1924, most, from, russia, and, eastern, europe, a, similar, case, occurred, in, the, southern, tip, of, the, continent, specifically, in, the, countries, of, argentina, and, uruguay, during, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, the, jewish, population, in, europe, began, to, more, actively, discuss, emigration, to, ottoman, syria, with, the, aim, of, re, establishing, a, jewish, polity, in, palestine, and, fulfilling, the, biblical, prophecies, related, to, shivat, tzion, in, 1882, the, first, zionist, settlement, rishon, lezion, was, founded, by, immigrants, who, belonged, to, the, hovevei, zion, movement, later, on, the, bilu, movement, established, many, other, settlements, in, palestine, the, zionist, movement, was, officially, founded, after, the, kattowitz, convention, 1884, and, the, world, zionist, congress, 1897, and, it, was, theodor, herzl, who, initiated, the, struggle, to, establish, a, state, for, the, jews, after, the, first, world, war, it, seemed, that, the, conditions, that, made, it, possible, for, the, jews, to, establish, such, a, state, had, arrived, the, united, kingdom, captured, palestine, from, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, jews, received, the, promise, of, a, national, home, from, the, british, in, the, form, of, the, balfour, declaration, of, 1917, given, to, chaim, weizmann, in, 1920, the, british, mandate, of, palestine, was, established, and, the, pro, jewish, herbert, samuel, was, appointed, high, commissioner, of, palestine, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, was, established, and, several, large, jewish, immigration, waves, to, palestine, occurred, the, arab, co, inhabitants, of, palestine, were, hostile, to, increasing, jewish, immigration, however, and, as, a, result, they, began, to, express, their, opposition, to, the, establishment, of, jewish, settlements, and, they, also, began, to, express, their, opposition, to, the, pro, jewish, policy, of, the, british, government, in, violent, ways, arab, gangs, began, to, commit, violent, acts, which, included, the, murder, of, individual, jews, attacks, on, convoys, and, attacks, on, the, jewish, population, after, the, 1920, arab, riots, and, the, 1921, jaffa, riots, the, jewish, leadership, in, palestine, believed, that, the, british, had, no, desire, to, confront, local, arab, gangs, and, punish, them, for, their, attacks, on, palestinian, jews, believing, that, they, could, not, rely, on, the, british, administration, for, protection, from, these, gangs, the, jewish, leadership, created, the, haganah, organization, in, order, to, protect, its, community, s, farms, and, kibbutzim, major, riots, occurred, during, the, 1929,

supporting, the, establishment, of, a, jewish, homeland, and, it, also, started, to, speculate, on, a, binational, solution, to, the, crisis, or, the, establishment, of, an, arab, state, that, would, have, a, jewish, minority, meanwhile, the, jews, of, europe, and, the, united, states, gained, success, in, the, fields, of, science, culture, and, the, economy, among, those, jews, who, were, generally, considered, the, most, famous, were, the, scientist, albert, einstein, and, the, philosopher, ludwig, wittgenstein, at, that, time, a, disproportionate, number, of, nobel, prize, winners,

party, s, rise, to, power, in, germany, the, jewish, situation, became, more, severe, economic, crises, racial, anti, jewish, laws, and, fear, of, an, upcoming, war, led, many, jews, to, flee, from,
