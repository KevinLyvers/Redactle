sumer, s, u, m, r, is, the, earliest, known, civilization, located, in, the, historical, region, of, southern, mesopotamia, now, south, central, iraq, emerging, during, the, chalcolithic, and, early, bronze, ages, between, the, sixth, and, fifth, millennium, bc, like, nearby, elam, it, is, one, of, the, cradles, of, civilization, along, with, egypt, the, indus, valley, the, erligang, culture, of, the, yellow, river, valley, caral, supe, the, cucuteni, trypillia, culture, of, the, carpathian, mountains, and, mesoamerica, living, along, the, valleys, of, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, sumerian, farmers, grew, an, abundance, of, grain, and, other, crops, a, surplus, which, enabled, them, to, form, urban, settlements, the, world, s, earliest, known, texts, come, from, the, sumerian, cities, of, uruk, and, jemdet, nasr, and, date, to, between, c, 3350, c, 2500, bc, following, a, period, of, proto, writing, c, 4000, c, 2500, bc, the, term, sumer, akkadian, romanized, umeru, comes, from, the, akkadian, name, for, the, sumerians, the, ancient, non, semitic, speaking, inhabitants, of, southern, mesopotamia, in, their, inscriptions, the, sumerians, called, their, land, kengir, the, country, of, the, noble, lords, sumerian, romanized, ki, en, gi, r, lit, country, lords, noble, and, their, language, emegir, sumerian, romanized, eme, g, ir, or, eme, gi, 15, the, origin, of, the, sumerians, is, not, known, but, the, people, of, sumer, referred, to, themselves, as, black, headed, ones, or, black, headed, people, sumerian, romanized, sag, g, g, lit, head, black, or, sag, g, g, ga, phonetically, sa, i, a, lit, head, black, relative, marker, for, example, the, sumerian, king, shulgi, described, himself, as, the, king, of, the, four, quarters, the, pastor, of, the, black, headed, people, the, akkadians, also, called, the, sumerians, black, headed, people, or, almat, qaqqadi, in, the, semitic, akkadian, language, the, akkadians, the, east, semitic, speaking, people, who, later, conquered, the, sumerian, city, states, gave, sumer, its, main, historical, name, but, the, phonological, development, of, the, term, umer, is, uncertain, hebrew, in, ar, egyptian, sngr, and, hittite, anhar, a, all, referring, to, southern, mesopotamia, could, be, western, variants, of, sumer, most, historians, have, suggested, that, sumer, was, first, permanently, settled, between, c, 5500, c, 3300, bc, by, a, west, asian, people, who, spoke, the, sumerian, language, pointing, to, the, names, of, cities, rivers, basic, occupations, etc, as, evidence, a, non, semitic, and, non, indo, european, agglutinative, language, isolate, others, have, suggested, that, the, sumerians, were, a, north, african, people, who, migrated, from, the, green, sahara, into, the, middle, east, and, were, responsible, for, the, spread, of, farming, in, the, middle, east, however, contrary, evidence, strongly, suggests, that, the, first, farming, originated, in, the, fertile, crescent, although, not, specifically, discussing, sumerians, lazaridis, et, al, 2016, have, suggested, a, partial, north, african, origin, for, some, pre, semitic, cultures, of, the, middle, east, particularly, natufians, after, testing, the, genomes, of, natufian, and, pre, pottery, neolithic, culture, bearers, some, scholars, associate, the, sumerians, with, the, hurrians, and, urartians, and, suggest, the, caucasus, as, their, homeland, this, is, not, generally, accepted, a, prehistoric, people, who, lived, in, the, region, before, the, sumerians, have, been, termed, the, proto, euphrateans, or, ubaidians, and, are, theorized, to, have, evolved, from, the, samarra, culture, of, northern, mesopotamia, the, ubaidians, though, never, mentioned, by, the, sumerians, themselves, are, assumed, by, modern, day, scholars, to, have, been, the, first, civilizing, force, in, sumer, they, drained, the, marshes, for, agriculture, developed, trade, and, established, industries, including, weaving, leatherwork, metalwork, masonry, and, pottery, some, scholars, contest, the, idea, of, a, proto, euphratean, language, or, one, substrate, language, they, think, the, sumerian, language, may, originally, have, been, that, of, the, hunting, and, fishing, peoples, who, lived, in, the, marshland, and, the, eastern, arabia, littoral, region, and, were, part, of, the, arabian, bifacial, culture, juris, zarins, believes, the, sumerians, lived, along, the, coast, of, eastern, arabia, today, s, persian, gulf, region, before, it, was, flooded, at, the, end, of, the, ice, age, sumerian, civilization, took, form, in, the, uruk, period, 4th, millennium, bc, continuing, into, the, jemdet, nasr, and, early, dynastic, periods, the, sumerian, city, of, eridu, on, the, coast, of, the, persian, gulf, is, considered, to, have, been, one, of, the, oldest, cities, where, three, separate, cultures, may, have, fused, that, of, peasant, ubaidian, farmers, living, in, mud, brick, huts, and, practicing, irrigation, that, of, mobile, nomadic, semitic, pastoralists, living, in, black, tents, and, following, herds, of, sheep, and, goats, and, that, of, fisher, folk, living, in, reed, huts, in, the, marshlands, who, may, have, been, the, ancestors, of, the, sumerians, reliable, historical, records, begin, with, enmebaragesi, early, dynastic, i, the, sumerians, progressively, lost, control, to, semitic, states, from, the, northwest, sumer, was, conquered, by, the, semitic, speaking, kings, of, the, akkadian, empire, around, 2270, bc, short, chronology, but, sumerian, continued, as, a, sacred, language, native, sumerian, rule, re, emerged, for, about, a, century, in, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, at, approximately, 2100, 2000, bc, but, the, akkadian, language, also, remained, in, use, for, some, time, the, sumerians, were, entirely, unknown, during, the, early, period, of, modern, archeology, jules, oppert, was, the, first, scholar, to, publish, the, word, sumer, in, a, lecture, on, 17, january, 1869, the, first, major, excavations, of, sumerian, cities, were, in, 1877, at, girsu, by, the, french, archeologist, ernest, de, sarzec, in, 1889, at, nippur, by, john, punnett, peters, from, the, university, of, pennsylvania, between, 1889, and, 1900, and, in, shuruppak, by, german, archeologist, robert, koldewey, in, 1902, 1903, major, publications, of, these,

by, canals, and, boundary, stones, each, was, centered, on, a, temple, dedicated, to, the, particular, patron, god, or, goddess, of, the, city, and, ruled, over, by, a, priestly, governor, ensi, or, by, a, king, lugal, who, was, intimately, tied, to, the, city, s, religious, rites, the, five, first, cities, said, to, have, exercised, pre, dynastic, kingship, before, the, flood, other, principal, cities, minor, cities, from, south, to, north, 2, an, outlying, city, in, northern, mesopotamia, apart, from, mari, which, lies, full, 330, kilometres, 205, miles, north, west, of, agade, but, which, is, credited, in, the, king, list, as, having, exercised, kingship, in, the, early, dynastic, ii, period, and, nagar, an, outpost, these, cities, are, all, in, the, euphrates, tigris, alluvial, plain,

the, prehistoric, ubaid, and, uruk, periods, sumerian, written, history, reaches, back, to, the, 27th, century, bc, and, before, but, the, historical, record, remains, obscure, until, the, early, dynastic, iii, period, c, 23rd, century, bc, when, the, language, of, the, written, records, becomes, easier, to, decipher, which, has, allowed, archaeologists, to, read, contemporary, records, and, inscriptions, the, akkadian, empire, was, the, first, state, that, successfully, united, larger, parts, of, mesopotamia, in, the, 23rd, century, bc, after, the, gutian, period, the, ur, iii, kingdom, similarly, united, parts, of, northern, and, southern, mesopotamia, it, ended, in, the, face, of, amorite, incursions, at, the, beginning, of, the, second, millennium, bc, the, amorite, dynasty, of, isin, persisted, until, c, 1700, bc, when, mesopotamia, was, united, under, babylonian, rule, the, ubaid, period, is, marked, by, a, distinctive, style, of, fine, quality, painted, pottery, which, spread, throughout, mesopotamia, and, the, persian, gulf, the, oldest, evidence, for, occupation, comes, from, tell, el, oueili, but, given, that, environmental, conditions, in, southern, mesopotamia, were, favourable, to, human, occupation, well, before, the, ubaid, period, it, is, likely, that, older, sites, exist, but, have, not, yet, been, found, it, appears, that, this, culture, was, derived, from, the, samarran, culture, from, northern, mesopotamia, it, is, not, known, whether, or, not, these, were, the, actual, sumerians, who, are, identified, with, the, later, uruk, culture, the, story, of, the, passing, of, the, gifts, of, civilization, me, to, inanna, goddess, of, uruk, and, of, love, and, war, by, enki, god, of, wisdom, and, chief, god, of, eridu, may, reflect, the, transition, from, eridu, to, uruk, the, archaeological, transition, from, the, ubaid, period, to, the, uruk, period, is, marked, by, a, gradual, shift, from, painted, pottery, domestically, produced, on, a, slow, wheel, to, a, great, variety, of, unpainted, pottery, mass, produced, by, specialists, on, fast, wheels, the, uruk, period, is, a, continuation, and, an, outgrowth, of, ubaid, with, pottery, being, the, main, visible, change, by, the, time, of, the, uruk, period, c, 4100, 2900, bc, calibrated, the, volume, of, trade, goods, transported, along, the, canals, and, rivers, of, southern, mesopotamia, facilitated, the, rise, of, many, large, stratified, temple, centered, cities, with, populations, of, over, 10, 000, people, where, centralized, administrations, employed, specialized, workers, it, is, fairly, certain, that, it, was, during, the, uruk, period, that, sumerian, cities, began, to, make, use, of, slave, labour, captured, from, the, hill, country, and, there, is, ample, evidence, for, captured, slaves, as, workers, in, the, earliest, texts, artifacts, and, even, colonies, of, this, uruk, civilization, have, been, found, over, a, wide, area, from, the, taurus, mountains, in, turkey, to, the, mediterranean, sea, in, the, west, and, as, far, east, as, western, iran, 2, 3, the, uruk, period, civilization, exported, by, sumerian, traders, and, colonists, like, that, found, at, tell, brak, had, an, effect, on, all, surrounding, peoples, who, gradually, evolved, their, own, comparable, competing, economies, and, cultures, the, cities, of, sumer, could, not, maintain, remote, long, distance, colonies, by, military, force, sumerian, cities, during, the, uruk, period, were, probably, theocratic, and, were, most, likely, headed, by, a, priest, king, ensi, assisted, by, a, council, of, elders, including, both, men, and, women, it, is, quite, possible, that, the, later, sumerian, pantheon, was, modeled, upon, this, political, structure, there, was, little, evidence, of, organized, warfare, or, professional, soldiers, during, the, uruk, period, and, towns, were, generally, unwalled, during, this, period, uruk, became, the, most, urbanized, city, in, the, world, surpassing, for, the, first, time, 50, 000, inhabitants, the, ancient, sumerian, king, list, includes, the, early, dynasties, of, several, prominent, cities, from, this, period, the, first, set, of, names, on, the, list, is, of, kings, said, to, have, reigned, before, a, major, flood, occurred, these, early, names, may, be, fictional, and, include, some, legendary, and, mythological, figures, such, as, alulim, and, dumizid, the, end, of, the, uruk, period, coincided, with, the, piora, oscillation, a, dry, period, from, c, 3200, 2900, bc, that, marked, the, end, of, a, long, wetter, warmer, climate, period, from, about, 9, 000, to, 5, 000, years, ago, called, the, holocene, climatic, optimum, the, dynastic, period, begins, c, 2900, bc, and, was, associated, with, a, shift, from, the, temple, establishment, headed, by, council, of, elders, led, by, a, priestly, en, a, male, figure, when, it, was, a, temple, for, a, goddess, or, a, female, figure, when, headed, by, a, male, god, towards, a, more, secular, lugal, lu, man, gal, great, and, includes, such, legendary, patriarchal, figures, as, dumuzid, lugalbanda, and, gilgamesh, who, reigned, shortly, before, the, historic, record, opens, c, 2900, bc, when, the, now, deciphered, syllabic, writing, started, to, develop, from, the, early, pictograms, the, center, of, sumerian, culture, remained, in, southern, mesopotamia, even, though, rulers, soon, began, expanding, into, neighboring, areas, and, neighboring, semitic, groups, adopted, much, of, sumerian, culture, for, their, own, the, earliest, dynastic, king, on, the, sumerian, king, list, whose, name, is, known, from, any, other, legendary, source, is, etana, 13th, king, of, the, first, dynasty, of, kish, the, earliest, king, authenticated, through, archaeological, evidence, is, enmebaragesi, of, kish, early, dynastic, i, whose, name, is, mentioned, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, leading, to, the, suggestion, that, gilgamesh, himself, might, have, been, a, historical, king, of, uruk, as, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, shows, this, period, was, associated, with, increased, war, cities, became, walled, and, increased, in, size, as, undefended, villages, in, southern, mesopotamia, disappeared, both, enmerkar, and, gilgamesh, are, credited, with, having, built, the, walls, of, uruk, the, dynasty, of, lagash, c, 2500, 2270, bc, though, omitted, from, the, king, list, is, well, attested, through, several, important, monuments, and, many, archaeological, finds, although, short, lived, one, of, the, first, empires, known, to, history, was, that, of, eannatum, of, lagash, who, annexed, practically, all, of, sumer, including, kish, uruk, ur, and, larsa, and, reduced, to, tribute, the, city, state, of, umma, arch, rival, of, lagash, in, addition, his, realm, extended, to, parts, of, elam, and, along, the, persian, gulf, he, seems, to, have, used, terror, as, a, matter, of, policy, eannatum, s, stele, of, the, vultures, depicts, vultures, pecking, at, the, severed, heads, and, other, body, parts, of, his, enemies, his, empire, collapsed, shortly, after, his, death, later, lugal, zage, si, the, priest, king, of, umma, overthrew, the, primacy, of, the, lagash, dynasty, in, the, area, then, conquered, uruk, making, it, his, capital, and, claimed, an, empire, extending, from, the, persian, gulf, to, the, mediterranean, he, was, the, last, ethnically, sumerian, king, before, sargon, of, akkad, the, akkadian, empire, dates, to, c, 2234, 2154, bc, middle, chronology, founded, by, sargon, of, akkad, the, eastern, semitic, akkadian, language, is, first, attested, in, proper, names, of, the, kings, of, kish, c, 2800, bc, preserved, in, later, king, lists, there, are, texts, written, entirely, in, old, akkadian, dating, from, c, 2500, bc, use, of, old, akkadian, was, at, its, peak, during, the, rule, of, sargon, the, great, c, 2334, 2279, bc, but, even, then, most, administrative, tablets, continued, to, be, written, in, sumerian, the, language, used, by, the, scribes, gelb, and, westenholz, differentiate, three, stages, of, old, akkadian, that, of, the, pre, sargonic, era, that, of, the, akkadian, empire, and, that, of, the, ur, iii, period, that, followed, it, akkadian, and, sumerian, coexisted, as, vernacular, languages, for, about, one, thousand, years, but, by, around, 1800, bc, sumerian, was, becoming, more, of, a, literary, language, familiar, mainly, only, to, scholars, and, scribes, thorkild, jacobsen, has, argued, that, there, is, little, break, in, historical, continuity, between, the, pre, and, post, sargon, periods, and, that, too, much, emphasis, has, been, placed, on, the, perception, of, a, semitic, vs, sumerian, conflict, it, is, certain, that, akkadian, was, also, briefly, imposed, on, neighboring, parts, of, elam, that, were, previously, conquered, by, sargon, c, 2193, 2119, bc, middle, chronology, c, 2200, 2110, bc, middle, chronology, following, the, downfall, of, the, akkadian, empire, at, the, hands, of, gutians, another, native, sumerian, ruler, gudea, of, lagash, rose, to, local, prominence, and, continued, the, practices, of, the, sargonic, kings, claims, to, divinity, the, previous, lagash, dynasty, gudea, and, his, descendants, also, promoted, artistic, development, and, left, a, large, number, of, archaeological, artifacts, later, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, under, ur, nammu, and, shulgi, c, 2112, 2004, bc, middle, chronology, whose, power, extended, as, far, as, southern, assyria, has, been, erroneously, called, a, sumerian, renaissance, in, the, past, already, the, region, was, becoming, more, semitic, than, sumerian, with, the, resurgence, of, the, akkadian, speaking, semites, in, assyria, and, elsewhere, and, the, influx, of, waves, of, semitic, martu, amorites, who, founded, several, competing, local, powers, in, the, south, including, isin, larsa, eshnunna, and, later, babylonia, the, last, of, these, eventually, came, to, briefly, dominate, the, south, of, mesopotamia, as, the, babylonian, empire, just, as, the, old, assyrian, empire, had, already, done, in, the, north, from, the, late, 21st, century, bc, the, sumerian, language, continued, as, a, sacerdotal, language, taught, in, schools, in, babylonia, and, assyria, much, as, latin, was, used, in, the, medieval, period, for, as, long, as, cuneiform, was, used, this, period, is, generally, taken, to, coincide, with, a, major, shift, in, population, from, southern, mesopotamia, toward, the, north, ecologically, the, agricultural, productivity, of, the, sumerian, lands, was, being, compromised, as, a, result, of, rising, salinity, soil, salinity, in, this, region, had, been, long, recognized, as, a, major, problem, poorly, drained, irrigated, soils, in, an, arid, climate, with, high, levels, of, evaporation, led, to, the, buildup, of, dissolved, salts, in, the, soil, eventually, reducing, agricultural, yields, severely, during, the, akkadian, and, ur, iii, phases, there, was, a, shift, from, the, cultivation, of, wheat, to, the, more, salt, tolerant, barley, but, this, was, insufficient, and, during, the, period, from, 2100, bc, to, 1700, bc, it, is, estimated, that, the, population, in, this, area, declined, by, nearly, three, fifths, this, greatly, upset, the, balance, of, power, within, the, region, weakening, the, areas, where, sumerian, was, spoken, and, comparatively, strengthening, those, where, akkadian, was, the, major, language, henceforth, sumerian, remained, only, a, literary, and, liturgical, language, similar, to, the, position, occupied, by, latin, in, medieval, europe, following, an, elamite, invasion, and, sack, of, ur, during, the, rule, of, ibbi, sin, c, 2028, 2004, bc, sumer, came, under, amorite, rule, taken, to, introduce, the, middle, bronze, age, the, independent, amorite, states, of, the, 20th, to, 18th, centuries, are, summarized, as, the, dynasty, of, isin, in, the, sumerian, king, list, ending, with, the, rise, of, babylonia, under, hammurabi, c, 1800, bc, later, rulers, who, dominated, assyria, and, babylonia, occasionally, assumed, the, old, sargonic, title, king, of, sumer, and, akkad, such, as, tukulti, ninurta, i, of, assyria, after, c, 1225, bc, uruk, one, of, sumer, s, largest, cities, has, been, estimated, to, have, had, a, population, of, 50, 000, 80, 000, at, its, height, given, the, other, cities, in, sumer, and, the, large, agricultural, population, a, rough, estimate, for, sumer, s, population, might, be, 0, 8, million, to, 1, 5, million, the, world, population, at, this, time, has, been, estimated, at, 27, million, the, sumerians, spoke, a, language, isolate, a, number, of, linguists, have, claimed, to, be, able, to, detect, a, substrate, language, of, unknown, classification, beneath, sumerian, because, names, of, some, of, sumer, s, major, cities, are, not, sumerian, revealing, influences, of, earlier, inhabitants, however, the, archaeological, record, shows, clear, uninterrupted, cultural, continuity, from, the, time, of, the, early, ubaid, period, 5300, 4700, bc, c, 14, settlements, in, southern, mesopotamia, the, sumerian, people, who, settled, here, farmed, the, lands, in, this, region, that, were, made, fertile, by, silt, deposited, by, the, tigris, and, the, euphrates, some, archaeologists, have, speculated, that, the, original, speakers, of, ancient, sumerian, may, have, been, farmers, who, moved, down, from, the, north, of, mesopotamia, after, perfecting, irrigation, agriculture, there, the, ubaid, period, pottery, of, southern, mesopotamia, has, been, connected, via, choga, mami, transitional, ware, to, the, pottery, of, the, samarra, period, culture, c, 5700, 4900, bc, c, 14, in, the, north, who, were, the, first, to, practice, a, primitive, form, of, irrigation, agriculture, along, the, middle, tigris, river, and, its, tributaries, the, connection, is, most, clearly, seen, at, tell, el, oueili, near, larsa, excavated, by, the, french, in, the, 1980s, where, eight, levels, yielded, pre, ubaid, pottery, resembling, samarran, ware, according, to, this, theory, farming, peoples, spread, down, into, southern, mesopotamia, because, they, had, developed, a, temple, centered, social, organization, for, mobilizing, labor, and, technology, for, water, control, enabling, them, to, survive, and, prosper, in, a, difficult, environment, others, have, suggested, a, continuity, of, sumerians, from, the, indigenous, hunter, fisherfolk, traditions, associated, with, the, bifacial, assemblages, found, on, the, arabian, littoral, juris, zarins, believes, the, sumerians, may, have, been, the, people, living, in, the, persian, gulf, region, before, it, flooded, at, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, in, the, early, sumerian, period, the, primitive, pictograms, suggest, that, there, is, considerable, evidence, concerning, sumerian, music, lyres, and, flutes, were, played, among, the, best, known, examples, being, the, lyres, of, ur, sumerian, culture, was, male, dominated, and, stratified, the, code, of, ur, nammu, the, oldest, such, codification, yet, discovered, dating, to, the, ur, iii, reveals, a, glimpse, at, societal, structure, in, late, sumerian, law, beneath, the, lu, gal, great, man, or, king, all, members, of, society,

polyandry, in, his, country, prescribing, that, a, woman, who, took, multiple, husbands, be, stoned, with, rocks, upon, which, her, crime, had, been, written, marriages, were, usually, arranged, by,

wife, has, borne, him, eight, sons, and, is, still, eager, to, have, sex, the, sumerians, considered, it, desirable, for, women, to, still, be, virgins, at, the, time, of, marriage, 100, 101, but, did, not, expect, the, same, of, men, 102, 103, although, one, author, considers, premarital, sex, in, general, to, have, been, discouraged, neither, sumerian, nor, akkadian, had, a, word, exactly, corresponding, to, the, english, word, virginity, and, the, concept, was, expressed, descriptively, for, example, as, a, nu, gi, 4, a, sum, la, naqbat, akk, un, deflowered, or, gi, nunzua, never, having, known, a, penis, 91, 93, it, is, unclear, whether, terms, such, as, i, itu, in, akkadian, medical, texts, indicate, the, hymen, but, it, appears, that, the, intactness, of, the, hymen, was, much, less, relevant, to, assessing, a, woman, s, virginity, than, in, later, cultures, of, the, near, east, most, assessments, of, virginity, depended, on, the, woman, s, own, account, 91, 92, from, the, earliest, records, the, sumerians, had, very, relaxed, attitudes, toward, sex, their, sexual, mores, were, determined, not, by, whether, a, sexual, act, was, deemed, immoral, but, rather, by, whether, or, not, it, made, a, person, ritually, unclean, the, sumerians, widely, believed, that, masturbation, enhanced, sexual, potency, both, for, men, and, for, women, and, they, frequently, engaged, in, it, both, alone, and, with, their, partners, the, sumerians, did, not, regard, anal, sex, as, taboo, either, entu, priestesses, were, forbidden, from, producing, offspring, and, frequently, engaged, in, anal, sex, as, a, method, of, birth, control, prostitution, existed, but, it, is, not, clear, if, sacred, prostitution, did, 151, the, most, important, archaeological, discoveries, in, sumer, are, a, large, number, of, clay, tablets, written, in, cuneiform, script, sumerian, writing, is, considered, to, be, a, great, milestone, in, the, development, of, humanity, s, ability, to, not, only, create, historical, records, but, also, in, creating, pieces, of, literature, both, in, the, form, of, poetic, epics, and, stories, as, well, as, prayers, and, laws, although, the, writing, system, was, first, hieroglyphic, using, ideograms, logosyllabic, cuneiform, soon, followed, triangular, or, wedge, shaped, reeds, were, used, to, write, on, moist, clay, a, large, body, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, texts, in, the, sumerian, language, have, survived, including, personal, and, business, letters, receipts, lexical, lists, laws, hymns, prayers, stories, and, daily, records, full, libraries, of, clay, tablets, have, been, found, monumental, inscriptions, and, texts, on, different, objects, like, statues, or, bricks, are, also, very, common, many, texts, survive, in, multiple, copies, because, they, were, repeatedly, transcribed, by, scribes, in, training, sumerian, continued, to, be, the, language, of, religion, and, law, in, mesopotamia, long, after, semitic, speakers, had, become, dominant, a, prime, example, of, cuneiform, writing, is, a, lengthy, poem, that, was, discovered, in, the, ruins, of, uruk, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, was, written, in, the, standard, sumerian, cuneiform, it, tells, of, a, king, from, the, early, dynastic, ii, period, named, gilgamesh, or, bilgamesh, in, sumerian, the, story, relates, the, fictional, adventures, of, gilgamesh, and, his, companion, enkidu, it, was, laid, out, on, several, clay, tablets, and, is, thought, to, be, the, earliest, known, surviving, example, of, fictional, literature, the, sumerian, language, is, generally, regarded, as, a, language, isolate, in, linguistics, because, it, belongs, to, no, known, language, family, akkadian, by, contrast, belongs, to, the, semitic, branch, of, the, afroasiatic, languages, there, have, been, many, failed, attempts, to, connect, sumerian, to, other, language, families, it, is, an, agglutinative, language, in, other, words, morphemes, units, of, meaning, are, added, together, to, create, words, unlike, analytic, languages, where, morphemes, are, purely, added, together, to, create, sentences, some, authors, have, proposed, that, there, may, be, evidence, of, a, substratum, or, adstratum, language, for, geographic, features, and, various, crafts, and, agricultural, activities, called, variously, proto, euphratean, or, proto, tigrean, but, this, is, disputed, by, others, understanding, sumerian, texts, today, can, be, problematic, most, difficult, are, the, earliest, texts, which, in, many, cases, do, not, give, the, full, grammatical, structure, of, the, language, and, seem, to, have, been, used, as, an, aide, m, moire, for, knowledgeable, scribes, akkadian, gradually, replaced, sumerian, as, a, spoken, language, somewhere, around, the, turn, of, the, 3rd, and, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, sumerian, continued, to, be, used, as, a, sacred, ceremonial, literary, and, scientific, language, in, babylonia, and, assyria, until, the, 1st, century, ad, the, sumerians, credited, their, divinities, for, all, matters, pertaining, to, them, and, exhibited, humility, in, the, face, of, cosmic, forces, such, as, death, and, divine, wrath, 3, 4, sumerian, religion, seems, to, have, been, founded, upon, two, separate, cosmogenic, myths, the, first, saw, creation, as, the, result, of, a, series, of, hieroi, gamoi, or, sacred, marriages, involving, the, reconciliation, of, opposites, postulated, as, a, coming, together, of, male, and, female, divine, beings, the, gods, this, pattern, continued, to, influence, regional, mesopotamian, myths, thus, in, the, later, akkadian, enuma, elish, creation, was, seen, as, the, union, of, fresh, and, salt, water, between, male, abzu, and, female, tiamat, the, products, of, that, union, lahm, and, lahmu, the, muddy, ones, were, titles, given, to, the, gate, keepers, of, the, e, abzu, temple, of, enki, in, eridu, the, first, sumerian, city, mirroring, the, way, that, muddy, islands, emerge, from, the, confluence, of, fresh, and, salty, water, at, the, mouth, of, the, euphrates, where, the, river, deposits, its, load, of, silt, a, second, hieros, gamos, supposedly, resulted, in, the, creation, of, anshar, and, kishar, the, sky, pivot, or, axle, and, the, earth, pivot, parents, in, turn, of, anu, the, sky, and, ki, the, earth, another, important, sumerian, hieros, gamos, was, that, between, ki, here, known, as, ninhursag, or, lady, of, the, mountains, and, enki, of, eridu, the, god, of, fresh, water, which, brought, forth, greenery, and, pasture, at, an, early, stage, following, the, dawn, of, recorded, history, nippur, in, central, mesopotamia, replaced, eridu, in, the, south, as, the, primary, temple, city, whose, priests, exercised, political, hegemony, on, the, other, city, states, nippur, retained, this, status, throughout, the, sumerian, period, sumerians, believed, in, an, anthropomorphic, polytheism, or, the, belief, in, many, gods, in, human, form, there, was, no, common, set, of, gods, each, city, state, had, its, own, patrons, temples, and, priest, kings, nonetheless, these, were, not, exclusive, the, gods, of, one, city, were, often, acknowledged, elsewhere, sumerian, speakers, were, among, the, earliest, people, to, record, their, beliefs, in, writing, and, were, a, major, inspiration, in, later, mesopotamian, mythology, religion, and, astrology, the, sumerians, worshiped, these, deities, formed, the, main, pantheon, and, in, addition, to, this, there, were, hundreds, of, other, minor, gods, sumerian, gods, were, often, associated, with, different, cities, and, their, religious, importance, often, waxed, and, waned, with, those, cities, political, power, the, gods, were, said, to, have, created, human, beings, from, clay, for, the, purpose, of, serving, them, the, temples, organized, the, mass, labour, projects, needed, for, irrigation, agriculture, citizens, had, a, labor, duty, to, the, temple, though, they, could, avoid, it, by, a, payment, of, silver, sumerians, believed, that, the, universe, consisted, of, a, flat, disk, enclosed, by, a, dome, the, sumerian, afterlife, involved, a, descent, into, a, gloomy, netherworld, to, spend, eternity, in, a, wretched, existence, as, a, gidim, ghost, the, universe, was, divided, into, four, quarters, their, known, world, extended, from, the, upper, sea, or, mediterranean, coastline, to, the, lower, sea, the, persian, gulf, and, the, land, of, meluhha, probably, the, indus, valley, and, magan, oman, famed, for, its, copper, ores, ziggurats, sumerian, temples, each, had, an, individual, name, and, consisted, of, a, forecourt, with, a, central, pond, for, purification, the, temple, itself, had, a, central, nave, with, aisles, along, either, side, flanking, the, aisles, would, be, rooms, for, the, priests, at, one, end, would, stand, the, podium, and, a, mudbrick, table, for, animal, and, vegetable, sacrifices, granaries, and, storehouses, were, usually, located, near, the, temples, after, a, time, the, sumerians, began, to, place, the, temples, on, top, of, multi, layered, square, constructions, built, as, a, series, of, rising, terraces, giving, rise, to, the, ziggurat, style, it, was, believed, that, when, people, died, they, would, be, confined, to, a, gloomy, world, of, ereshkigal, whose, realm, was, guarded, by, gateways, with, various, monsters, designed, to, prevent, people, entering, or, leaving, the, dead, were, buried, outside, the, city, walls, in, graveyards, where, a, small, mound, covered, the, corpse, along, with, offerings, to, monsters, and, a, small, amount, of, food, those, who, could, afford, it, sought, burial, at, dilmun, human, sacrifice, was, found, in, the, death, pits, at, the, ur, royal, cemetery, where, queen, puabi, was, accompanied, in, death, by, her, servants, the, sumerians, adopted, an, agricultural, lifestyle, perhaps, as, early, as, c, 5000, 4500, bc, the, region, demonstrated, a, number, of, core, agricultural, techniques, including, organized, irrigation, large, scale, intensive, cultivation, of, land, monocropping, involving, the, use, of, plough, agriculture, and, the, use, of, an, agricultural, specialized, labour, force, under, bureaucratic, control, the, necessity, to, manage, temple, accounts, with, this, organization, led, to, the, development, of, writing, c, 3500, bc, in, the, early, sumerian, uruk, period, the, primitive, pictograms, suggest, that, sheep, goats, cattle, and, pigs, were, domesticated, they, used, oxen, as, their, primary, beasts, of, burden, and, donkeys, or, equids, as, their, primary, transport, animal, and, woollen, clothing, as, well, as, rugs, were, made, from, the, wool, or, hair, of, the, animals, by, the, side, of, the, house, was, an, enclosed, garden, planted, with, trees, and, other, plants, wheat, and, probably, other, cereals, were, sown, in, the, fields, and, the, shaduf, was, already, employed, for, the, purpose, of, irrigation, plants, were, also, grown, in, pots, or, vases, the, sumerians, were, one, of, the, first, known, beer, drinking, societies, cereals, were, plentiful, and, were, the, key, ingredient, in, their, early, brew, they, brewed, multiple, kinds, of, beer, consisting, of, wheat, barley, and, mixed, grain, beers, beer, brewing, was, very, important, to, the, sumerians, it, was, referenced, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, when, enkidu, was, introduced, to, the, food, and, beer, of, gilgamesh, s, people, drink, the, beer, as, is, the, custom, of, the, land, he, drank, the, beer, seven, jugs, and, became, expansive, and, sang, with, joy, the, sumerians, practiced, similar, irrigation, techniques, as, those, used, in, egypt, american, anthropologist, robert, mccormick, adams, says, that, irrigation, development, was, associated, with, urbanization, and, that, 89, of, the, population, lived, in, the, cities, they, grew, barley, chickpeas, lentils, wheat, dates, onions, garlic, lettuce, leeks, and, mustard, sumerians, caught, many, fish, and, hunted, fowl, and, gazelle, sumerian, agriculture, depended, heavily, on, irrigation, the, irrigation, was, accomplished, by, the, use, of, shaduf, canals, channels, dykes, weirs, and, reservoirs, the, frequent, violent, floods, of, the, tigris, and, less, so, of, the, euphrates, meant, that, canals, required, frequent, repair, and, continual, removal, of, silt, and, survey, markers, and, boundary, stones, needed, to, be, continually, replaced, the, government, required, individuals, to, work, on, the, canals, in, a, corv, e, although, the, rich, were, able, to, exempt, themselves, as, is, known, from, the, sumerian, farmer, s, almanac, after, the, flood, season, and, after, the, spring, equinox, and, the, akitu, or, new, year, festival, using, the, canals, farmers, would, flood, their, fields, and, then, drain, the, water, next, they, made, oxen, stomp, the, ground, and, kill, weeds, they, then, dragged, the, fields, with, pickaxes, after, drying, they, plowed, harrowed, and, raked, the, ground, three, times, and, pulverized, it, with, a, mattock, before, planting, seed, unfortunately, the, high, evaporation, rate, resulted, in, a, gradual, increase, in, the, salinity, of, the, fields, by, the, ur, iii, period, farmers, had, switched, from, wheat, to, the, more, salt, tolerant, barley, as, their, principal, crop, sumerians, harvested, during, the, spring, in, three, person, teams, consisting, of, a, reaper, a, binder, and, a, sheaf, handler, the, farmers, would, use, threshing, wagons, driven, by, oxen, to, separate, the, cereal, heads, from, the, stalks, and, then, use, threshing, sleds, to, disengage, the, grain, they, then, winnowed, the, grain, chaff, mixture, the, sumerians, were, great, artists, sumerian, artefacts, show, great, detail, and, ornamentation, with, fine, semi, precious, stones, imported, from, other, lands, such, as, lapis, lazuli, marble, and, diorite, and, precious, metals, like, hammered, gold, incorporated, into, the, design, since, stone, was, rare, it, was, reserved, for, sculpture, the, most, widespread, material, in, sumer, was, clay, as, a, result, many, sumerian, objects, are, made, of, clay, metals, such, as, gold, silver, copper, and, bronze, along, with, shells, and, gemstones, were, used, for, the, finest, sculptures, and, inlays, small, stones, of, all, kinds, including, more, precious, stones, such, as, lapis, lazuli, alabaster, and, serpentine, were, used, for, cylinder, seals, some, of, the, most, famous, masterpieces, are, the, lyres, of, ur, which, are, considered, to, be, the, world, s, oldest, surviving, stringed, instruments, they, were, discovered, by, leonard, woolley, when, the, royal, cemetery, of, ur, was, excavated, between, 1922, and, 1934, the, tigris, euphrates, plain, lacked, minerals, and, trees, sumerian, structures, were, made, of, plano, convex, mudbrick, not, fixed, with, mortar, or, cement, mud, brick, buildings, eventually, deteriorate, so, they, were, periodically, destroyed, leveled, and, rebuilt, on, the, same, spot, this, constant, rebuilding, gradually, raised, the, level, of, cities, which, thus, came, to, be, elevated, above, the, surrounding, plain, the, resultant, hills, known, as, tells, are, found, throughout, the, ancient, near, east, according, to, archibald, sayce, the, primitive, pictograms, of, the, early, sumerian, i, e, uruk, era, suggest, that, stone, was, scarce, but, was, already, cut, into, blocks, and, seals, brick, was, the, ordinary, building, material, and, with, it, cities, forts, temples, and, houses, were, constructed, the, city, was, provided, with, towers, and, stood, on, an, artificial, platform, the, house, also, had, a, tower, like, appearance, it, was, provided, with, a, door, which, turned, on, a, hinge, and, could, be, opened, with, a, sort, of, key, the, city, gate, was, on, a, larger, scale, and, seems, to, have, been, double, the, foundation, stones, or, rather, bricks, of, a, house, were, consecrated, by, certain, objects, that, were, deposited, under, them, the, most, impressive, and, famous, of, sumerian, buildings, are, the, ziggurats, large, layered, platforms, that, supported, temples, sumerian, cylinder, seals, also, depict, houses, built, from, reeds, not, unlike, those, built, by, the, marsh, arabs, of, southern, iraq, until, as, recently, as, 400, ce, the, sumerians, also, developed, the, arch, which, enabled, them, to, develop, a, strong, type, of, dome, they, built, this, by, constructing, and, linking, several, arches, sumerian, temples, and, palaces, made, use, of, more, advanced, materials, and, techniques, such, as, buttresses, recesses, half, columns, and, clay, nails, the, sumerians, developed, a, complex, system, of, metrology, c, 4000, bc, this, advanced, metrology, resulted, in, the, creation, of, arithmetic, geometry, and, algebra, from, c, 2600, bc, onwards, the, sumerians, wrote, multiplication, tables, on, clay, tablets, and, dealt, with, geometrical, exercises, and, division, problems, the, earliest, traces, of, the, babylonian, numerals, also, date, back, to, this, period, the, period, c, 2700, 2300, bc, saw, the, first, appearance, of, the, abacus, and, a, table, of, successive, columns, which, delimited, the, successive, orders, of, magnitude, of, their, sexagesimal, number, system, the, sumerians, were, the, first, to, use, a, place, value, numeral, system, there, is, also, anecdotal, evidence, the, sumerians, may, have, used, a, type, of, slide, rule, in, astronomical, calculations, they, were, the, first, to, find, the, area, of, a, triangle, and, the, volume, of, a, cube, discoveries, of, obsidian, from, far, away, locations, in, anatolia, and, lapis, lazuli, from, badakhshan, in, northeastern, afghanistan, beads, from, dilmun, modern, bahrain, and, several, seals, inscribed, with, the, indus, valley, script, suggest, a, remarkably, wide, ranging, network, of, ancient, trade, centered, on, the, persian, gulf, for, example, imports, to, ur, came, from, many, parts, of, the, world, in, particular, the, metals, of, all, types, had, to, be, imported, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, refers, to, trade, with, far, lands, for, goods, such, as, wood, that, were, scarce, in, mesopotamia, in, particular, cedar, from, lebanon, was, prized, the, finding, of, resin, in, the, tomb, of, queen, puabi, at, ur, indicates, it, was, traded, from, as, far, away, as, mozambique, the, sumerians, used, slaves, although, they, were, not, a, major, part, of, the, economy, slave, women, worked, as, weavers, pressers, millers, and, porters, sumerian, potters, decorated, pots, with, cedar, oil, paints, the, potters, used, a, bow, drill, to, produce, the, fire, needed, for, baking, the, pottery, sumerian, masons, and, jewelers, knew, and, made, use, of, alabaster, calcite, ivory, iron, gold, silver, carnelian, and, lapis, lazuli, evidence, for, imports, from, the, indus, to, ur, can, be, found, from, around, 2350, bc, various, objects, made, with, shell, species, that, are, characteristic, of, the, indus, coast, particularly, turbinella, pyrum, and, pleuroploca, trapezium, have, been, found, in, the, archaeological, sites, of, mesopotamia, dating, from, around, 2500, 2000, bc, carnelian, beads, from, the, indus, were, found, in, the, sumerian, tombs, of, ur, the, royal, cemetery, at, ur, dating, to, 2600, 2450, in, particular, carnelian, beads, with, an, etched, design, in, white, were, probably, imported, from, the, indus, valley, and, made, according, to, a, technique, of, acid, etching, developed, by, the, harappans, lapis, lazuli, was, imported, in, great, quantity, by, egypt, and, already, used, in, many, tombs, of, the, naqada, ii, period, c, 3200, bc, lapis, lazuli, probably, originated, in, northern, afghanistan, as, no, other, sources, are, known, and, had, to, be, transported, across, the, iranian, plateau, to, mesopotamia, and, then, egypt, several, indus, seals, with, harappan, script, have, also, been, found, in, mesopotamia, particularly, in, ur, babylon, and, kish, gudea, the, ruler, of, the, neo, summerian, empire, at, lagash, is, recorded, as, having, imported, translucent, carnelian, from, meluhha, generally, thought, to, be, the, indus, valley, area, various, inscriptions, also, mention, the, presence, of, meluhha, traders, and, interpreters, in, mesopotamia, about, twenty, seals, have, been, found, from, the, akkadian, and, ur, iii, sites, that, have, connections, with, harappa, and, often, use, harappan, symbols, or, writing, the, indus, valley, civilization, only, flourished, in, its, most, developed, form, between, 2400, and, 1800, bc, but, at, the, time, of, these, exchanges, it, was, a, much, larger, entity, than, the, mesopotamian, civilization, covering, an, area, of, 1, 2, million, square, kilometers, with, thousands, of, settlements, compared, to, an, area, of, only, about, 65, 000, square, kilometers, for, the, occupied, area, of, mesopotamia, while, the, largest, cities, were, comparable, in, size, at, about, 30, 40, 000, inhabitants, large, institutions, kept, their, accounts, in, barley, and, silver, often, with, a, fixed, rate, between, them, the, obligations, loans, and, prices, in, general, were, usually, denominated, in, one, of, them, many, transactions, involved, debt, for, example, goods, consigned, to, merchants, by, temple, and, beer, advanced, by, ale, women, commercial, credit, and, agricultural, consumer, loans, were, the, main, types, of, loans, the, trade, credit, was, usually, extended, by, temples, in, order, to, finance, trade, expeditions, and, was, nominated, in, silver, the, interest, rate, was, set, at, 1, 60, a, month, one, shekel, per, mina, some, time, before, 2000, bc, and, it, remained, at, that, level, for, about, two, thousand, years, rural, loans, commonly, arose, as, a, result, of, unpaid, obligations, due, to, an, institution, such, as, a, temple, in, this, case, the, arrears, were, considered, to, be, lent, to, the, debtor, they, were, denominated, in, barley, or, other, crops, and, the, interest, rate, was, typically, much, higher, than, for, commercial, loans, and, could, amount, to, 1, 3, to, 1, 2, of, the, loan, principal, periodically, rulers, signed, clean, slate, decrees, that, cancelled, all, the, rural, but, not, commercial, debt, and, allowed, bondservants, to, return, to, their, homes, customarily, rulers, did, it, at, the, beginning, of, the, first, full, year, of, their, reign, but, they, could, also, be, proclaimed, at, times, of, military, conflict, or, crop, failure, the, first, known, ones, were, made, by, enmetena, and, urukagina, of, lagash, in, 2400, 2350, bc, according, to, hudson, the, purpose, of, these, decrees, was, to, prevent, debts, mounting, to, a, degree, that, they, threatened, the, fighting, force, which, could, happen, if, peasants, lost, their, subsistence, land, or, became, bondservants, due, to, inability, to, repay, their, debt, the, almost, constant, wars, among, the, sumerian, city, states, for, 2000, years, helped, to, develop, the, military, technology, and, techniques, of, sumer, to, a, high, level, the, first, war, recorded, in, any, detail, was, between, lagash, and, umma, in, c, 2450, bc, on, a, stele, called, the, stele, of, the, vultures, it, shows, the, king, of, lagash, leading, a, sumerian, army, consisting, mostly, of, infantry, the, infantry, carried, spears, wore, copper, helmets, and, carried, rectangular, shields, the, spearmen, are, shown, arranged, in, what, resembles, the, phalanx, formation, which, requires, training, and, discipline, this, implies, that, the, sumerians, may, have, used, professional, soldiers, the, sumerian, military, used, carts, harnessed, to, onagers, these, early, chariots, functioned, less, effectively, in, combat, than, did, later, designs, and, some, have, suggested, that, these, chariots, served, primarily, as, transports, though, the, crew, carried, battle, axes, and, lances, the, sumerian, chariot, comprised, a, four, or, two, wheeled, device, manned, by, a, crew, of, two, and, harnessed, to, four, onagers, the, cart, was, composed, of, a, woven, basket, and, the, wheels, had, a, solid, three, piece, design, sumerian, cities, were, surrounded, by, defensive, walls, the, sumerians, engaged, in, siege, warfare, between, their, cities, but, the, mudbrick, walls, were, able, to, deter, some, foes, examples, of, sumerian, technology, include, the, wheel, cuneiform, script, arithmetic, and, geometry, irrigation, systems, sumerian, boats, lunisolar, calendar, bronze, leather, saws, chisels, hammers, braces, bits, nails, pins, rings, hoes, axes, knives, lancepoints, arrowheads, swords, glue, daggers, waterskins, bags, harnesses, armor, quivers, war, chariots, scabbards, boots, sandals, harpoons, and, beer, the, sumerians, had, three, main, types, of, boats, evidence, of, wheeled, vehicles, appeared, in, the, mid, 4th,
