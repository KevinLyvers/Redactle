off, course, and, detained, them, young, chinese, men, were, selected, by, the, vietnamese, for, castration, to, become, eunuch, slaves, to, the, vietnamese, it, has, been, speculated, by, modern, historians, that, chinese, who, were, captured, and, castrated, by, the, vietnamese, were, involved, in, regular, trade, between, china, and, vietnam, instead, of, being, blown, off, course, and, that, they, were, punished, after, a, vietnamese, crackdown, on, trade, with, foreign, countries, a, 1499, entry, in, the, ming, shilu, recorded, that, thirteen, chinese, men, from, wenchang,

agricultural, laborers, while, the, youngest, chinese, man, wu, rui, was, selected, by, the, vietnamese, court, for, castration, since, he, was, the, only, young, man, in, among, the, thirteen, and, he, became, a, eunuch, at, the, vietnamese, imperial, palace, in, thang, long, for, nearly, one, fourth, of, a, century, after, years, of, serving, the, vietnamese, as, a, eunuch, slave, in, the, palace, he, was, promoted, to, a, position, with, real, power, after, the, death, of, the, vietnamese, ruler, in, 1497, to, a, military, position, in, northern, vietnam, as, military, superintendent, since, his, service, in, the, palace, was, apparently, valued, by, the, vietnamese, however, the, l, ng, s, n, guard, soldier, d, ng, tam, tri, yang, sanzhi, told, him, of, an, escape, route, back, to, china, and, wu, rui, escaped, to, longzhou, after, walking, for, 9, days, through, the, mountains, the, local, ethnic, minority, tusi, chief, wei, chen, took, him, into, custody, overruling, objections, from, his, family, who, wanted, to, send, him, back, to, vietnam, vietnam, found, out, about, his, escape, and, sent, an, agent, to, buy, wu, rui, back, from, wei, chen, with, 100, jin, in, payment, since, they, were, scared, that, wu, rui, would, reveal, vietnamese, state, secrets, to, china, wei, chen, planned, to, sell, him, back, to, the, vietnamese, but, told, them, the, amount, they, were, offering, was, too, little, and, demanded, more, however, before, they, could, agree, on, a, price, wu, was, rescued, by, the, pingxiang, magistrate, li, guangning, and, then, was, sent,

they, were, returning, to, malacca, from, china, the, vietnamese, enslaved, and, castrated, the, young, from, among, the, captured, a, 1472, entry, in, the, ming, shilu, reported, that, some, chinese,

incident, was, reported, both, the, incidents, of, the, young, chinese, man, wu, rui, and, the, more, than, 100, chinese, men, being, castrated, and, used, as, eunuchs, point, to, possible, involvement, in, trade, according, to, historians, john, k, whitmore, and, tana, li, which, was, then, suppressed, by, the, vietnamese, government, instead, of, them, really, being, blown, off,

agreed, and, although, the, emperor, had, two, elder, sons, l, tu, n, and, l, tu, n, l, thu, n, was, designed, as, crown, prince, due, to, his, deep, interest, in, intellectuality, and, neo,

the, vietnamese, navy, then, attacked, the, chinese, pirate, fleet, which, was, unable, to, fire, back, with, their, wet, guns, the, chinese, pirate, fleet, originally, 206, junks, was, reduced, to, 50, 80, junks, by, the, time, it, reached, south, vietnam, s, quang, nam, and, the, mekong, delta, the, chinese, pirates, having, sex, with, north, vietnamese, women, may, also, have, transmitted, a, deadly, epidemic, from, china, to, the, vietnamese, which, ravaged, the, tonkin, regime, of, north, vietnam, french, and, chinese, sources, say, a, typhoon, contributed, to, the, loss, of, ships, along, with, the, disease, the, nguy, n, court, allowed, yang, duong, and, his, surviving, followers, to, resettle, in, ng, nai, which, had, been, newly, acquired, from, the, khmers, duong, s,

nh, and, the, nguy, n, for, four, months, a, large, tr, nh, army, campaigned, against, the, nguy, n, army, but, were, unable, to, defeat, them, the, result, of, this, war, was, that, vietnam, had, effectively, been, partitioned, into, northern, and, southern, regions, with, the, tr, nh, controlling, most, of, the, north, and, the, nguy, n, controlling, most, of, the, south, the, dividing, line, was, the, gianh, river, in, qu, ng, b, nh, province, this, border, was, very, close, to, the, seventeenth, parallel, in, actuality, the, b, n, h, i, river, located, just, to, the, south, in, qu, ng, tr, province, which, was, imposed, as, the, border, between, north, vietnam, and, south, vietnam, during, the, 1954, 1975, partition, of, vietnam, while, the, tr, nh, ruled, over, a, much, more, populous, territory, the, nguy, n, had, several, advantages, first, they, were, on, the, defensive, and, as, such, were, more, motivated, to, fight, second, the, nguy, n, were, able, to, take, advantage, of, their, contacts, with, the, europeans, specifically, the, portuguese, to, purchase, advanced, european, weapons, and, hire, european, military, experts, in, fortifications, third, the, geography, was, favorable, to, them, as, the, flat, plains, of, the, north, suitable, for, large, organized, armies, ended, at, nguy, n, controlled, territory, the, mountains, of, the, central, highlands, reach, almost, to, the, sea, after, the, first, campaign, the, nguy, n, built, two, massive, fortified, lines, which, stretched, a, few, miles, from, the, sea, to, the, central, highlands, the, walls, were, built, north, of, hu, near, the, city, of, ng, h, i, the, nguy, n, defended, these, lines, against, numerous, tr, nh, offensives, which, lasted, till, 1672, tradition, holds, that, the, builder, of, these, walls, was, a, vietnamese, general, who, was, hired, from, the, tr, nh, court, by, the, nguy, n, under, his, direction, the, walls, held, repeatedly, against, multiple, tr, nh, assaults, even, when, they, mustered, an, army, of, 100, 000, men, 500, elephants, and, 500, large, ships, in, 1633, the, tr, nh, tried, attacking, the, nguy, n, by, sea, to, avoid, costly, assaults, on, the, great, walls, however, the, tr, nh, fleet, was, defeated, by, the, nguy, n, fleet, at, the, battle, of, nhat, le, around, 1635, the, tr, nh, decided, to, emulate, the, nguy, n, and, sought, military, aid, from, the, europeans, tr, nh, tr, ng, hired, the, voc, to, make, european, cannons, and, ships, for, his, army, in, 1642, 43, the, tr, nh, army, attacked, the, nguy, n, walls, with, the, aid, of, the, dutch, cannons, the, tr, nh, army, broke, through, the, first, wall, but, failed, to, break, through, the, second, at, sea, the, tr, nh, with, their, dutch, ships, kievit, nachtegaels, and, woekende, book, were, defeated, at, sea, by, the, nguy, n, fleet, with, their, chinese, style, galleys, tr, nh, tr, ng, staged, yet, another, offensive, in, 1648, but, at, the, battle, of, truong, duc, the, tr, nh, army, was, again, badly, beaten, by, the, nguy, n, the, new, l, emperor, died, around, this, time, perhaps, as, a, result, of, the, defeat, this, now, left, the, door, open, for, the, nguy, n, to, finally, go, on, the, offensive, the, nguy, n, launched, their, own, invasion, of, northern, vietnam, in, 1653, the, nguy, n, army, went, north, and, defeated, the, weakened, tr, nh, army, capturing, qu, ng, b, nh, and, h, t, nh, province, in, the, following, year, tr, nh, tr, ng, died, as, nguy, n, forces, entered, ngh, an, province, under, the, leadership, of, tr, nh, tr, ng, s, successor, the, capable, tr, nh, t, c, however, the, northern, army, managed, to, defeat, the, nguy, n, army, the, nguy, n, were, also, further, weakened, by, a, division, between, their, two, top, generals, who, refused, to, cooperate, with, each, other, in, 1656, the, nguy, n, army, was, driven, back, all, the, way, to, their, original, territories, tr, nh, t, c, tried, to, break, the, walls, of, the, nguy, n, in, 1661, but, this, attack, like, so, many, before, it, failed, in, 1672, the, tr, nh, army, made, a, last, effort, to, conquer, the, nguy, n, the, attacking, army, was, under, the, command, of, tr, nh, t, c, s, son, tr, nh, c, n, while, the, defending, army, was, under, the, command, of, nguy, n, ph, c, t, n, s, son, prince, nguy, n, ph, c, thu, n, the, attack, like, all, the, previous, attacks, on, the, nguy, n, walls, failed, this, time, the, two, sides, agreed, to, a, peace, with, the, qing, dynasty, under, the, kangxi, emperor, serving, as, mediator, the, tr, nh, and, the, nguy, n, finally, agreed, to, end, the, fighting, by, making, the, linh, river, the, border, between, their, lands, 1673, although, the, nguy, n, nominally, accepted, the, l, emperor, as, the, legitimate, and, sole, ruler, of, vietnam, however, the, reality, was, that, the, nguy, n, ruled, the, south, and, the, tr, nh, the, north, this, division, continued, for, the, next, century, the, border, between, the, tr, nh, and, the, nguy, n, was, strongly, fortified, yet, remained, peaceful, despite, the, de, facto, partition, of, the, empire, both, the, ruling, families, of, the, two, realms, claimed, to, be, loyal, subjects, under, the, authority, of, the, singular, imperial, l, family, and, their, territories, were, de, jure, all, under, the, same, empire, i, vi, t, the, stalemate, between, the, tr, nh, and, the, nguy, n, lords, that, began, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, did, not, however, mark, the, beginning, of, a, period, of, peace, and, prosperity, instead, the, decades, of, continual, warfare, between, the, two, families, had, left, the, ruists, and, peasantry, in, a, weakened, state, the, victim, of, taxes, levied, to, support, the, courts, and, their, military, adventures, having, to, meet, their, tax, obligations, had, forced, many, peasants, off, the, land, and, facilitated, the, acquisition, of, large, tracts, by, a, few, wealthy, landowners, nobles, and, scholar, officials, because, scholar, officials, were, exempted, from, having, to, pay, a, land, tax, the, more, land, they, acquired, the, greater, was, the, burden, that, fell, on, those, peasants, who, had, been, able, to, retain, their, land, in, addition, the, peasantry, faced, new, taxes, on, staple, items, such, as, charcoal, salt, silk, and, cinnamon, and, on, commercial, activities, such, as, fishing, and, mining, the, disparate, condition, of, the, economy, led, to, neglect, of, the, extensive, network, of, irrigation, systems, as, well, as, they, fell, into, disrepair, disastrous, flooding, and, famine, resulted, unleashing, great, numbers, of, starving, and, landless, people, to, wander, aimlessly, about, the, countryside, the, widespread, suffering, in, north, vietnam, led, to, numerous, peasant, revolts, between, 1730, and, 1770, notable, the, peasant, rebellion, of, nguy, n, h, u, c, u, from, 1748, to, 1751, although, the, uprisings, took, place, throughout, the, country, they, were, essentially, local, phenomena, breaking, out, spontaneously, from, similar, local, causes, the, occasional, coordination, between, and, among, local, movements, did, not, result, in, any, national, organization, or, leadership, moreover, most, of, the, uprisings, were, conservative, in, that, the, leaders, supported, the, restoration, of, the, l, dynasty, they, did, however, put, forward, demands, for, land, reform, more, equitable, taxes, and, rice, for, all, landless, peasants, accounted, for, most, of, the, initial, support, for, the, various, rebellions, but, they, were, often, joined, later, by, craftsmen, fishermen, miners, and, traders, who, had, been, taxed, out, of, their, occupations, some, of, these, movements, enjoyed, limited, success, for, a, short, time, but, it, was, not, until, 1771, that, any, of, the, peasant, revolts, had, a, lasting, national, impact, dissatisfaction, against,
