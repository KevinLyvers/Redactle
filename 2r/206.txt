in, world, history, post, classical, history, refers, to, the, period, from, about, 500, ce, to, 1500, ce, roughly, corresponding, to, the, european, middle, ages, the, period, is, characterized, by, the, expansion, of, civilizations, geographically, and, the, development, of, trade, networks, between, civilizations, this, period, is, also, called, the, medieval, era, post, antiquity, era, post, ancient, era, pre, modernity, era, or, pre, modern, era, in, asia, the, spread, of, islam, created, a, series, of, caliphates, and, inaugurated, the, islamic, golden, age, leading, to, advances, in, science, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, and, trade, among, the, asian, african, and, european, continents, east, asia, experienced, the, full, establishment, of, the, power, of, imperial, china, which, established, several, dynasties, influencing, japan, korea, and, vietnam, religions, such, as, buddhism, and, neo, confucianism, spread, in, the, region, gunpowder, was, developed, in, china, during, the, post, classical, era, the, mongol, empire, connected, europe, and, asia, creating, safe, trade, and, stability, between, the, two, regions, in, total, the, population, of, the, world, doubled, in, the, time, period, from, approximately, 210, million, in, 500, ce, to, 461, million, in, 1500, ce, the, population, generally, grew, steadily, throughout, the, period, but, endured, some, incidental, declines, due, to, events, including, the, plague, of, justinian, the, mongol, invasions, and, the, black, death, post, classical, history, is, a, periodization, used, by, historians, employing, a, world, history, approach, to, history, specifically, the, school, developed, during, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, outside, of, world, history, the, term, is, also, sometimes, used, to, avoid, erroneous, pre, conceptions, around, the, terms, middle, ages, medieval, period, and, the, dark, ages, see, medievalism, though, the, application, of, the, term, post, classical, on, a, global, scale, is, also, problematic, and, may, likewise, be, eurocentric, academic, publications, sometimes, use, the, terms, post, classical, and, late, antiquity, synomously, to, describe, the, history, of, western, eurasia, between, 250, and, 800, ce, the, post, classical, period, corresponds, roughly, to, the, period, from, 500, ce, to, 1450, ce, beginning, and, ending, dates, might, vary, depending, on, the, region, with, the, period, beginning, at, the, end, of, the, previous, classical, period, han, china, ending, in, 220, ce, the, western, roman, empire, in, 476, ce, the, gupta, empire, in, 543, ce, and, the, sasanian, empire, in, 651, ce, the, post, classical, period, is, one, of, the, five, or, six, major, periods, world, historians, use, although, post, classical, is, synonymous, with, the, middle, ages, of, western, europe, the, term, post, classical, is, not, necessarily, a, member, of, the, traditional, tripartite, periodization, of, western, european, history, into, classical, middle, and, modern, the, historical, field, of, world, history, which, looks, at, common, themes, occurring, across, multiple, cultures, and, regions, has, enjoyed, extensive, development, since, the, 1980s, however, world, history, research, has, tended, to, focus, on, early, modern, globalization, beginning, around, 1500, and, subsequent, developments, and, views, post, classical, history, as, mainly, pertaining, to, afro, eurasia, historians, recognize, the, difficulties, of, creating, a, periodization, and, identifying, common, themes, that, include, not, only, this, region, but, also, for, example, the, americas, since, they, had, little, contact, with, afro, eurasia, before, the, columbian, exchange, thus, researchers, around, the, year, 2020, emphasized, that, a, global, history, of, the, period, between, 500, and, 1500, is, still, wanting, and, that, historians, have, only, just, begun, to, embark, on, a, global, history, of, the, middle, ages, for, many, regions, of, the, world, there, are, well, established, histories, although, medieval, studies, in, europe, tended, in, the, 19th, century, to, focus, on, creating, histories, for, individual, nation, states, much, 20th, century, research, focused, successfully, on, creating, an, integrated, history, of, medieval, europe, the, islamic, world, likewise, has, a, rich, regional, historiography, ranging, from, the, 14th, century, ibn, khaldun, to, the, 20th, century, marshall, hodgson, and, beyond, correspondingly, research, into, the, network, of, commercial, hubs, which, enabled, goods, and, ideas, to, move, between, china, in, the, east, and, the, atlantic, islands, in, the, west, which, can, be, called, the, early, history, of, globalization, is, fairly, advanced, one, key, historian, in, this, field, is, janet, abu, lughod, understanding, of, communication, within, sub, saharan, africa, or, the, americas, is, by, contrast, far, more, limited, around, the, 2010s, therefore, researchers, began, to, explore, the, possibilities, of, writing, history, covering, the, old, world, where, human, activities, were, fairly, interconnected, and, establish, its, relationship, with, other, cultural, spheres, such, as, the, americas, and, oceania, in, the, assessment, of, james, belich, john, darwin, margret, frenz, and, chris, wickham, global, history, may, be, boundless, but, global, historians, are, not, global, history, cannot, usefully, mean, the, history, of, everything, everywhere, all, the, time, three, approaches, seem, to, us, to, have, real, promise, one, is, global, history, as, the, pursuit, of, significant, historical, problems, across, time, space, and, specialism, this, can, sometimes, be, characterized, as, comparative, history, another, is, connectedness, including, transnational, relationships, the, third, approach, is, the, study, of, globalization, globalization, is, a, term, that, needs, to, be, rescued, from, the, present, and, salvaged, for, the, past, to, define, it, as, always, encompassing, the, whole, planet, is, to, mistake, the, current, outcome, for, a, very, ancient, process, a, number, of, commentators, have, pointed, to, the, history, of, the, earth, s, climate, as, a, useful, approach, to, world, history, in, the, middle, ages, noting, that, certain, climate, events, had, effects, on, all, human, populations, the, post, classical, era, saw, several, common, developments, or, themes, there, was, the, expansion, and, growth, of, civilization, into, new, geographic, areas, the, rise, and, or, spread, of, the, three, major, world, or, missionary, religions, and, a, period, of, rapidly, expanding, trade, and, trade, networks, while, scholastic, emphasis, has, remained, on, eurasia, there, is, a, growing, effort, to, examine, the, effects, of, these, global, trends, on, other, places, in, describing, geographic, zones, historians, have, identified, three, large, self, contained, world, regions, afro, eurasia, the, americas, and, oceania, first, was, the, expansion, and, growth, of, civilization, into, new, geographic, areas, across, asia, africa, europe, mesoamerica, and, western, south, america, however, as, noted, by, world, historian, peter, n, stearns, there, were, no, common, global, political, trends, during, the, post, classical, period, rather, it, was, a, period, of, loosely, organized, states, and, other, developments, but, no, common, political, patterns, emerged, in, asia, china, continued, its, historic, dynastic, cycle, and, became, more, complex, improving, its, bureaucracy, the, creation, of, the, islamic, empires, established, a, new, power, in, the, middle, east, north, africa, the, caucasus, and, central, asia, the, mali, and, songhai, empires, were, formed, in, west, africa, the, fall, of, roman, civilization, not, only, left, a, power, vacuum, for, the, mediterranean, and, europe, but, forced, certain, areas, to, build, what, some, historians, might, call, new, civilizations, entirely, an, entirely, different, political, system, was, applied, in, western, europe, i, e, feudalism, as, well, as, a, different, society, i, e, manorialism, however, the, once, eastern, roman, empire, byzantium, retained, many, features, of, old, rome, as, well, as, greek, and, persian, similarities, kievan, rus, and, subsequently, russia, began, development, in, eastern, europe, as, well, in, the, isolated, americas, mesoamerica, saw, the, building, of, the, aztec, empire, while, the, andean, region, of, south, america, saw, the, establishment, of, the, wari, empire, first, and, the, inca, empire, later, in, oceania, ancestors, of, modern, polynesians, were, established, in, village, communities, by, the, 6th, century, a, gradual, intensification, of, complexity, took, place, in, the, 13th, century, complex, states, were, established, most, notably, the, tu, i, tonga, empire, which, collected, tribute, from, many, island, chains, in, the, greater, region, religion, that, envisaged, the, possibility, that, all, humans, could, be, included, in, a, universal, order, had, emerged, already, in, the, first, millennium, bce, particularly, with, buddhism, in, the, following, millennium, buddhism, was, joined, by, two, other, major, universalizing, missionary, religions, both, developing, from, judaism, christianity, and, islam, by, the, end, of, the, period, these, three, religions, were, between, them, widespread, and, often, politically, dominant, across, the, old, world, outside, of, eurasia, religion, or, otherwise, a, veneration, of, the, supernatural, was, also, used, to, reinforce, power, structures, articulate, world, views, and, create, foundational, myths, for, society, mesoamerican, cosmological, narratives, are, an, example, of, this, finally, communication, and, trade, across, afro, eurasia, increased, rapidly, the, silk, road, continued, to, spread, cultures, and, ideas, through, trade, communication, spread, throughout, europe, asia, and, africa, trade, networks, were, established, between, western, europe, byzantium, early, russia, the, islamic, empires, and, the, far, eastern, civilizations, in, africa, the, earlier, introduction, of, the, camel, allowed, for, a, new, and, eventually, large, trans, saharan, trade, which, connected, sub, saharan, west, africa, to, eurasia, the, islamic, empires, adopted, many, greek, roman, and, indian, advances, and, spread, them, through, the, islamic, sphere, of, influence, allowing, these, developments, to, reach, europe, north, and, west, africa, and, central, asia, islamic, sea, trade, helped, connect, these, areas, including, those, in, the, indian, ocean, and, in, the, mediterranean, replacing, byzantium, in, the, latter, region, the, christian, crusades, into, the, middle, east, as, well, as, muslim, spain, and, sicily, brought, islamic, science, technology, and, goods, to, western, europe, western, trade, into, east, asia, was, pioneered, by, marco, polo, importantly, china, began, to, influence, regions, like, japan, korea, and, vietnam, through, trade, and, conquest, finally, the, growth, of, the, mongol, empire, in, central, asia, established, safe, trade, which, allowed, goods, cultures, ideas, and, disease, to, spread, between, asia, europe, and, africa, the, americas, had, their, own, trade, network, but, here, trade, was, restricted, by, range, and, scope, the, mayan, network, spread, across, mesoamerica, but, lacked, direct, connections, to, the, complex, societies, of, south, and, north, america, and, these, zones, remained, separate, from, one, another, in, oceania, some, of, the, island, chains, of, polynesia, engaged, in, trade, with, one, another, for, instance, with, outrigger, canoes, long, distance, communication, of, over, 2, 300, miles, between, hawaii, and, tahiti, was, maintained, for, centuries, before, its, disruption, and, separation, meanwhile, in, melanesia, there, is, evidence, of, exchanges, between, mainland, papua, new, guinea, and, the, trobriand, islands, off, its, coast, most, likely, for, obsidian, populations, moved, westward, until, 1200, after, which, the, network, dissolved, into, much, smaller, economies, during, post, classical, times, there, is, evidence, that, many, regions, of, the, world, were, affected, similarly, by, global, climate, conditions, however, direct, effects, in, temperature, and, precipitation, varied, by, region, according, to, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, changes, did, not, all, occur, at, once, generally, however, studies, found, that, temperatures, were, relatively, warmer, in, the, 11th, century, but, colder, by, the, early, 17th, century, the, degree, of, climate, change, which, occurred, in, all, regions, across, the, world, is, uncertain, as, is, whether, such, changes, were, all, part, of, a, global, trend, climate, trends, appear, to, be, more, recognizable, in, the, northern, than, in, the, southern, hemisphere, however, there, are, instances, where, climate, in, areas, without, written, records, have, been, estimated, historians, now, believe, the, southern, hemisphere, became, colder, between, 950, and, 1250, there, are, shorter, climate, periods, that, could, be, said, roughly, to, account, for, large, scale, climate, trends, in, the, post, classical, period, these, include, the, late, antique, little, ice, age, the, medieval, warm, period, and, the, little, ice, age, the, extreme, weather, events, of, 536, 537, were, likely, initiated, by, the, eruption, of, the, lake, ilopango, caldera, in, el, salvador, sulfate, emitted, into, the, air, initiated, global, cooling, migrations, and, crop, failures, worldwide, possibly, intensifying, an, already, cooler, time, period, records, show, that, the, world, s, average, temperature, remained, colder, for, at, least, a, century, afterwards, the, medieval, warm, period, from, 950, to, 1250, occurred, mostly, in, the, northern, hemisphere, causing, warmer, summers, in, many, areas, the, high, temperatures, would, only, be, surpassed, by, the, global, warming, of, the, 20th, 21st, centuries, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, warmer, temperatures, allowed, the, norse, to, colonize, greenland, due, to, ice, free, waters, outside, of, europe, there, is, evidence, of, warming, conditions, including, higher, temperatures, in, china, and, major, north, american, droughts, which, adversely, affected, numerous, cultures, after, 1250, glaciers, began, to, expand, in, greenland, affecting, its, thermohaline, circulation, and, cooling, the, entire, north, atlantic, in, the, 14th, century, the, growing, season, in, europe, became, unreliable, meanwhile, in, china, the, cultivation, of, oranges, was, driven, southward, by, colder, temperatures, especially, in, europe, the, little, ice, age, had, great, cultural, ramifications, it, persisted, until, the, industrial, revolution, long, after, the, post, classical, period, its, causes, are, unclear, possible, explanations, include, sunspots, orbital, cycles, of, the, earth, volcanic, activity, ocean, circulation, and, man, made, population, decline, this, timetable, gives, a, basic, overview, of, states, cultures, and, events, which, transpired, roughly, between, the, years, 200, and, 1500, sections, are, broken, by, political, and, geographic, location, this, section, explains, events, and, trends, which, affected, the, geographic, area, of, eurasia, the, civilizations, within, this, area, were, distinct, from, one, another, but, still, endured, shared, experiences, and, some, development, patterns, in, the, context, of, global, history, the, label, of, feudalism, has, been, used, to, describe, any, agricultural, society, where, central, authority, broke, down, to, be, replaced, by, a, warrior, aristocracy, feudal, societies, are, characterized, by, reliance, on, personal, relationships, with, military, elites, rather, than, a, bureaucracy, with, a, state, supported, professional, standing, army, the, label, of, feudalism, has, thus, been, used, to, describe, many, areas, of, eurasia, including, medieval, europe, the, islamic, iqta, system, indian, feudalism, and, heian, japan, some, world, historians, generalize, that, societies, can, be, called, feudal, if, authority, was, fragmented, with, a, set, of, obligations, between, vassal, and, lord, after, the, 8th, century, feudalism, became, more, common, across, europe, even, byzantium, which, had, inherited, the, government, of, the, roman, empire, chose, to, devolve, its, military, obligations, into, themes, to, increase, the, number, of, soldiers, and, ships, available, for, military, service, during, times, of, crisis, there, were, similarities, between, european, feudalism, and, the, islamic, iqta, as, both, featured, landed, classes, of, mounted, warriors, whose, titles, were, granted, by, a, monarch, or, sultan, because, of, these, similarities, it, was, common, for, societal, structures, to, be, preserved, in, the, face, of, religious, upheaval, for, instance, after, the, islamic, delhi, sultanate, conquered, large, portions, of, india, it, imposed, higher, taxes, but, otherwise, left, local, feudal, structures, in, place, though, most, of, eurasia, adopted, feudalism, and, similar, systems, during, this, era, china, employed, a, centralized, bureaucracy, throughout, much, of, the, post, classical, period, particularly, after, 1000, a, major, factor, that, distinguished, china, from, other, regions, was, that, local, leaders, were, reluctant, to, self, identify, by, their, current, location, instead, they, typically, displayed, an, ambition, to, unite, the, country, in, times, of, disunity, beyond, a, broad, generalization, the, usefulness, of, the, term, feudalism, is, debated, by, contemporary, historians, as, the, daily, functions, of, feudalism, sometimes, differed, greatly, between, world, regions, comparisons, between, feudal, europe, and, post, classical, japan, have, been, particularly, controversial, throughout, the, 20th, century, historians, often, compared, medieval, europe, to, post, classical, japan, more, recently, it, has, been, argued, that, until, roughly, 1400, japan, balanced, its, decentralized, military, power, with, more, centralized, forms, of, imperial, governmental, and, monastic, religious, authority, only, in, the, sengoku, period, did, there, come, to, be, fully, decentralized, power, dominated, by, private, military, leaders, still, other, historians, reject, the, term, feudalism, outright, challenging, its, ability, to, usefully, describe, societies, either, within, or, outside, of, medieval, europe, the, mongol, empire, which, existed, during, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, was, the, largest, continuous, land, empire, in, history, originating, in, the, steppes, of, central, asia, the, mongol, empire, eventually, stretched, from, central, europe, to, the, sea, of, japan, extending, northwards, into, siberia, eastwards, and, southwards, into, the, indian, subcontinent, indochina, and, the, iranian, plateau, and, westwards, as, far, as, the, levant, and, arabia, the, mongol, empire, emerged, from, the, unification, of, nomadic, tribes, in, the, mongolia, homeland, under, the, leadership, of, genghis, khan, who, was, proclaimed, ruler, of, all, mongols, in, 1206, the, empire, grew, rapidly, under, his, rule, and, then, under, his, descendants, who, sent, invasions, in, every, direction, the, vast, transcontinental, empire, connected, east, and, west, with, an, enforced, pax, mongolica, allowing, trade, technologies, commodities, and, ideologies, to, be, disseminated, and, exchanged, across, eurasia, the, empire, began, to, split, due, to, wars, over, succession, as, the, grandchildren, of, genghis, khan, disputed, whether, the, royal, line, should, follow, from, his, son, and, initial, heir, gedei, or, one, of, his, other, sons, such, as, tolui, chagatai, or, jochi, after, m, ngke, khan, died, rival, kurultai, councils, simultaneously, elected, different, successors, the, brothers, ariq, b, ke, and, kublai, khan, who, then, not, only, fought, each, other, in, the, toluid, civil, war, but, also, dealt, with, challenges, from, descendants, of, other, sons, of, genghis, kublai, successfully, took, power, but, civil, war, ensued, as, kublai, sought, unsuccessfully, to, regain, control, of, the, chagatayid, and, gedeid, families, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, in, 1260, marked, the, high, water, point, of, the, mongol, conquests, and, was, the, first, time, a, mongol, advance, had, ever, been, beaten, back, in, direct, combat, on, the, battlefield, though, the, mongols, launched, many, more, invasions, into, the, levant, briefly, occupying, it, and, raiding, as, far, as, gaza, after, a, decisive, victory, at, the, battle, of, wadi, al, khazandar, in, 1299, they, withdrew, due, to, various, geopolitical, factors, by, the, time, of, kublai, s, death, in, 1294, the, mongol, empire, had, fractured, into, four, separate, khanates, or, empires, each, pursuing, its, own, separate, interests, and, objectives, the, golden, horde, khanate, in, the, northwest, the, chagatai, khanate, in, the, west, the, ilkhanate, in, the, southwest, and, the, yuan, dynasty, based, in, modern, day, beijing, in, 1304, the, three, western, khanates, briefly, accepted, the, nominal, suzerainty, of, the, yuan, dynasty, but, it, was, later, overthrown, by, the, han, chinese, ming, dynasty, in, 1368, the, genghisid, rulers, returned, to, mongolia, homeland, and, continued, rule, in, the, northern, yuan, dynasty, all, of, the, original, mongol, khanates, collapsed, by, 1500, but, smaller, successor, states, remained, independent, until, the, 1700s, descendants, of, chagatai, khan, created, the, mughal, empire, that, ruled, much, of, india, in, early, modern, times, the, conquests, and, the, interactions, the, mongol, empire, had, with, western, eurasia, are, one, of, the, more, comprehensively, researched, areas, for, historians, looking, to, define, a, globalized, middle, ages, the, silk, road, was, a, eurasian, trade, route, that, played, a, large, role, in, global, communication, and, interaction, it, stimulated, cultural, exchange, encouraged, the, learning, of, new, languages, resulted, in, the, trade, of, many, goods, such, as, silk, gold, and, spices, and, also, spread, religion, and, disease, it, is, even, claimed, by, some, historians, such, as, andre, gunder, frank, william, hardy, mcneill, jerry, h, bentley, and, marshall, hodgson, that, the, afro, eurasian, world, was, loosely, united, culturally, and, that, the, silk, road, was, fundamental, to, this, unity, this, major, trade, route, began, with, the, han, dynasty, of, china, connecting, it, to, the, roman, empire, and, any, regions, in, between, or, nearby, at, this, time, central, asia, exported, horses, wool, and, jade, into, china, for, the, latter, s, silk, the, romans, would, trade, for, the, chinese, commodity, as, well, offering, wine, in, return, the, silk, road, would, often, decline, and, rise, again, in, trade, from, the, iron, age, to, the, post, classical, era, following, one, such, decline, it, was, reopened, in, central, asia, by, han, dynasty, general, ban, chao, during, the, 1st, century, there, were, vulnerabilities, as, well, to, changing, political, situations, the, rise, of, islam, changed, the, silk, road, because, muslim, rulers, generally, closed, the, silk, road, to, christian, europe, to, an, extent, that, europe, would, be, cut, off, from, asia, for, centuries, specifically, the, political, developments, that, affected, the, silk, road, included, the, emergence, of, the, turks, the, political, movements, of, the, byzatine, and, sasanian, empires, and, the, rise, of, the, arabs, among, others, the, silk, road, flourished, again, in, the, 13th, century, during, the, reign, of, the, mongol, empire, which, through, conquest, had, brought, stability, in, central, asia, comparable, to, the, pax, romana, it, was, claimed, by, a, muslim, historian, that, central, asia, was, peaceful, and, safe, to, transverse, central, asia, enjoyed, such, a, peace, that, a, man, might, have, journeyed, from, the, land, of, sunrise, to, the, land, of, sunset, with, a, golden, platter, upon, his, head, without, suffering, the, least, violence, from, anyone, as, such, trade, and, communication, between, europe, east, asia, south, asia, and, west, asia, required, little, effort, handicraft, production, art, and, scholarship, prospered, and, wealthy, merchants, enjoyed, cosmopolitan, cities, notable, travelers, including, ibn, battuta, rabban, bar, sauma, and, marco, polo, traveled, across, north, africa, and, eurasia, freely, those, that, left, accounts, of, their, experiences, inspired, future, adventurers, the, silk, road, was, also, a, major, factor, in, spreading, religion, across, afro, eurasia, muslim, teachings, from, arabia, and, persia, reached, east, asia, buddhism, spread, from, india, to, china, to, central, asia, one, significant, development, in, the, spread, of, buddhism, was, the, carving, of, the, gandhara, school, in, the, cities, of, ancient, taxila, and, the, peshwar, allegedly, in, the, mid, 1st, century, in, addition, to, commercial, travel, was, the, esteem, of, pilgrimage, that, existed, across, all, of, afro, eurasia, in, the, words, of, world, historian, r, i, moore, if, any, single, institution, made, the, eurasian, middle, ages, it, was, pilgrimage, nevertheless, after, the, 15th, century, the, silk, road, disappeared, from, regular, use, this, was, primarily, a, result, from, the, growing, sea, travel, pioneered, by, europeans, which, allowed, the, trade, of, goods, by, sailing, around, the, southern, tip, of, africa, and, into, the, indian, ocean, the, route, was, vulnerable, to, spreading, plague, the, plague, of, justinian, originated, in, east, africa, and, had, a, major, outbreak, in, europe, in, 542, causing, the, deaths, of, a, quarter, of, the, mediterranean, s, population, trade, between, europe, africa, and, asia, along, the, route, was, at, least, partially, responsible, for, spreading, the, plague, eight, centuries, later, the, silk, road, trade, played, a, role, in, spreading, the, infamous, black, death, the, disease, spread, by, rats, was, carried, by, merchant, ships, sailing, across, the, mediterranean, that, brought, the, plague, back, to, sicily, causing, an, epidemic, in, 1347, in, the, eurasian, world, disease, was, an, inescapable, part, of, daily, life, europe, in, particular, suffered, minor, outbreaks, of, disease, every, decade, during, the, period, using, both, land, and, sea, routes, devastating, pandemics, could, spread, far, beyond, their, initial, focal, point, tracking, the, origin, of, massive, bubonic, plagues, and, their, potential, spread, between, eastern, and, western, eurasia, has, been, academically, contentious, besides, bubonic, plague, other, diseases, including, smallpox, also, spread, across, cultural, regions, the, first, plague, pandemic, caused, by, yersinia, pestis, began, with, the, 541, 549, plague, of, justinian, the, origin, of, the, plague, appears, to, have, been, the, tian, shan, mountains, in, kyrgyzstan, but, the, origin, of, the, 541, 549, epidemic, remains, uncertain, some, historians, postulate, east, africa, as, a, possible, geographical, origin, there, is, no, record, of, a, disease, with, the, characteristics, of, yersinia, pestis, breaking, out, in, china, before, its, appearance, in, pelusium, egypt, the, plague, spread, to, europe, and, west, asia, with, a, possible, spread, into, east, asia, established, urban, civilizations, were, massively, depopulated, the, economies, and, social, fabric, of, established, empires, were, severely, destabilized, rural, societies, while, still, facing, horrific, death, tolls, saw, fewer, socioeconomic, effects, in, addition, no, evidence, has, been, found, of, bubonic, plague, in, india, before, 1600, nevertheless, it, is, likely, that, the, trauma, of, disease, and, other, natural, disasters, was, a, major, cause, of, profound, religious, and, political, changes, in, eurasia, different, authorities, reacted, to, disease, outbreaks, with, strategies, that, they, believed, would, best, protect, their, power, the, catholic, church, in, france, spoke, of, healing, miracles, confucian, bureaucrats, asserted, that, sudden, deaths, of, chinese, emperors, represented, the, loss, of, a, dynasty, s, mandate, of, heaven, shifting, blame, away, from, themselves, the, severe, loss, of, manpower, in, the, byzantine, and, sasanian, empires, contributed, to, early, muslim, conquests, in, the, region, in, the, long, term, overland, trade, in, eurasia, diminshed, as, coastal, indian, ocean, trade, became, more, frequent, there, were, recurrent, aftershocks, of, the, plague, of, justinian, until, around, 750, after, which, many, nations, saw, an, economic, recovery, six, centuries, later, a, relative, but, not, a, direct, descendant, of, yersinia, pestis, rose, to, afflict, eurasia, the, black, death, the, first, instance, of, the, second, plague, pandemic, was, between, 1347, and, 1351, it, killed, variously, between, 25, and, 50, of, populations, traditionally, many, historians, believed, the, black, death, started, in, china, and, was, then, spread, westward, by, invading, mongols, who, inadvertently, carried, infected, fleas, and, rats, with, them, although, there, is, no, concrete, historical, evidence, for, this, theory, the, plague, is, considered, endemic, on, the, steppe, currently, there, is, extensive, historiography, of, the, black, death, s, effects, in, europe, and, the, islamic, world, but, beyond, western, eurasia, direct, evidence, for, black, death, s, presence, is, lacking, the, bulletin, of, the, history, of, medicine, explored, the, potential, linking, of, known, 14th, century, epidemics, in, asia, with, the, plague, one, example, is, the, deccan, plateau, where, much, of, the, delhi, sultanate, s, army, suddenly, died, of, a, sickness, in, 1334, as, this, was, 15, years, before, europe, s, black, death, but, little, detail, about, the, symptoms, it, is, unlikely, that, this, was, an, instance, of, bubonic, plague, meanwhile, yuan, china, suffered, from, major, epidemics, in, the, mid, 14th, century, including, a, recorded, 90, death, rate, in, hebei, province, as, with, the, deccan, event, surviving, accounts, do, not, describe, symptoms, so, historians, are, left, to, speculate, perhaps, these, outbreaks, were, not, the, black, death, but, instead, some, other, disease, already, common, to, east, asia, at, the, time, such, as, typhus, smallpox, or, dysentery, compared, to, western, reactions, to, the, black, death, chinese, records, that, do, mention, the, epidemics, are, relatively, muted, indicating, that, epidemics, were, a, routine, occurrence, historians, consider, the, hypothesis, of, a, chinese, origin, of, a, westward, moving, plague, unlikely, given, the, fragmentation, of, the, mongol, empire, and, the, 5, 000, mile, journey, between, china, proper, and, crimea, through, sparsely, populated, central, asia, the, aftershocks, of, the, plague, continued, to, affect, populations, well, into, the, early, modern, period, in, western, europe, the, devastating, loss, of, people, created, lasting, changes, wage, labor, began, to, rise, in, western, europe, and, there, was, more, emphasis, on, labor, saving, machines, and, mechanisms, slavery, which, had, almost, vanished, from, medieval, europe, returned, and, was, one, of, the, reasons, for, early, portuguese, exploration, after, 1400, the, adoption, of, arabic, numerals, may, have, been, partially, caused, by, the, plague, importantly, many, economies, became, specialist, producing, only, certain, goods, seeking, expansion, elsewhere, for, exotic, resources, and, slave, labor, while, typically, western, european, expansion, as, a, result, of, the, black, death, is, most, discussed, islamic, countries, including, the, ottoman, empire, also, partook, in, land, based, expansionism, and, used, their, own, slave, trade, the, term, post, classical, science, is, often, used, in, academic, circles, and, in, college, courses, to, combine, the, study, of, medieval, european, science, and, medieval, islamic, science, due, to, their, interactions, with, one, another, however, scientific, knowledge, also, spread, westward, by, trade, and, war, from, eastern, eurasia, particularly, from, china, by, arabs, the, islamic, world, also, took, medical, knowledge, from, south, asia, in, the, western, world, and, in, islamic, realms, much, emphasis, was, placed, on, preserving, the, rationalist, greek, tradition, of, figures, such, as, aristotle, in, the, context, of, science, within, islam, there, are, questions, as, to, whether, islamic, scientists, simply, preserved, accomplishments, from, classical, antiquity, or, built, upon, earlier, greek, advances, regardless, classical, european, science, was, brought, back, to, the, christian, kingdoms, due, to, the, experience, of, the, crusades, as, a, result, of, persian, trade, in, china, and, the, battle, of, the, talas, river, chinese, innovations, entered, the, islamic, intellectual, world, these, include, advances, in, astronomy, and, in, papermaking, paper, making, spread, through, the, islamic, world, as, far, west, as, islamic, spain, before, paper, making, was, acquired, for, europe, by, the, reconquista, there, is, debate, about, transmission, of, gunpowder, regarding, whether, the, mongols, introduced, chinese, gunpowder, weapons, to, europe, or, whether, gunpowder, weapons, were, independently, invented, in, europe, in, the, mongol, empire, information, from, diverse, cultures, was, brought, together, for, large, projects, for, instance, in, 1303, the, mongol, yuan, dynasty, combined, chinese, and, islamic, cartography, to, make, a, map, that, likely, included, all, of, eurasia, including, western, europe, this, eurasia, map, is, now, lost, but, it, influenced, chinese, and, korean, geographical, knowledge, centuries, later, it, is, apparent, that, within, eurasia, transfer, of, information, between, world, cultures, did, occur, usually, through, translations, of, written, documents, within, eurasia, there, were, four, major, civilization, groups, that, had, literate, cultures, and, created, literature, and, arts, including, europe, west, asia, south, asia, and, east, asia, southeast, asia, could, be, a, possible, fifth, category, but, was, influenced, heavily, from, both, south, and, east, asia, literal, cultures, all, four, cultures, in, post, classical, times, used, poetry, drama, and, prose, throughout, the, period, and, until, the, 19th, century, poetry, was, the, dominant, form, of, literary, expression, in, west, asia, south, asia, europe, and, china, great, poetic, works, often, used, figurative, language, examples, include, the, sanskrit, shakuntala, the, arabic, thousand, and, one, nights, old, english, beowulf, and, works, by, the, chinese, du, fu, and, the, persian, rumi, in, japan, prose, uniquely, thrived, more, than, in, other, geographic, areas, the, tale, of, genji, is, considered, the, world, s, first, realistic, novel, written, in, the, 9th, century, musically, most, regions, of, the, world, only, used, monophonic, melodies, as, opposed, to, harmony, medieval, europe, was, the, lone, exception, to, this, rule, developing, harmonic, music, in, the, 14th, 15th, century, as, musical, culture, transitioned, form, sacred, music, meant, for, the, church, to, secular, music, south, asian, and, west, asian, music, were, similar, to, each, other, for, their, use, of, microtone, east, asian, music, shared, some, similarities, with, european, music, by, using, twelve, tones, and, employing, scales, but, differed, in, the, number, of, scales, used, 5, for, the, former, and, seven, for, the, latter, during, the, post, classical, era, africa, was, both, culturally, and, politically, affected, by, the, introduction, of, islam, and, the, arab, empires, this, was, especially, true, in, the, north, the, sudan, and, the, east, coast, however, this, conversion, was, not,

expansion, ended, with, wars, with, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, the, deadly, an, lushan, rebellion, which, resulted, in, a, deadly, but, uncertain, death, toll, of, millions, after, the, collapse, of, the, tang, dynasty, and, subsequent, civil, wars, came, the, second, phase, of, chinese, interest, in, foreign, relations, unlike, the, tang, the, song, specialized, in, overseas, trade, and, peacefully, created, a, maritime, network, and, china, s, population, became, concentrated, in, the, south, chinese, merchant, ships, reached, indonesia, india, and, arabia, southeast, asia, s,

coal, as, a, source, of, energy, the, advances, of, the, song, in, the, 11th, 12th, centuries, have, been, considered, an, early, industrial, revolution, economic, advancements, came, at, the, cost, of, military, affairs, and, the, song, became, open, to, invasions, from, the, north, china, became, divided, as, song, s, northern, lands, were, conquered, by, the, jurchen, people, by, 1200, there, were, five, chinese, kingdoms, stretching, from, modern, day, turkestan, to, the, sea, of, japan, including, the, western, liao, western, xia, jin, southern, song, and, dali, because, these, states, competed, with, each, other, they, all, were, eventually, annexed, by, the, rising, mongol, empire, before, 1279, after, seventy, years, of, conquest, the, mongols, proclaimed, the, yuan, dynasty, and, also, annexed, korea, they, failed, to, conquer, japan, mongol, conquerors, also, made, china, accessible, to, european, travelers, such, as, marco, polo, the, mongol, era, was, short, lived, due, to, plagues, and, famine, after, the, revolution, in, 1368, the, succeeding, ming, dynasty, ushered, in, a, period, of, prosperity, and, brief, foreign, expeditions, before, isolating, itself, from, global, affairs, for, centuries, korea, and, japan, however, continued, to, have, relations, with, china, and, with, other, asian, countries, in, the, 15th, century, sejong, the, great, of, korea, cemented, his, country, s, identity, by, creating, the, hangul, writing, system, to, replace, use, of, chinese, characters, meanwhile, japan, fell, under, military, rule, of, the, kamakura, and, later, ashikaga, shogunate, dominated, by, the, samurai, separate, from, developments, in, afro, eurasia, and, the, americas, the, region, of, greater, oceania, continued, to, develop, independently, of, the, outside, world, in, australia, the, society, of, aboriginal, australians, changed, little, through, the, post, classical, period, since, their, arrival, in, the, area, from, africa, around, 50, 000, bce, the, only, evidence, of, outside, contact, were, encounters, with, fishermen, of, indonesian, origin, polynesian, and, micronesian, peoples, are, rooted, from, taiwan, and, southeast, asia, and, began, their, migration, into, the, pacific, ocean, from, 3000, to, 1500, bce, after, the, 4th, century, the, micronesians, and, polynesians, began, to, explore, the, south, pacific, and, later, constructed, cities, in, previously, uninhabited, areas, including, nan, madol, mu, a, and, others, around, 1200, ce, the, tu, i, tonga, empire, spread, its, influence, far, and, wide, throughout, the, south, pacific, islands, being, described, by, academics, as, a, maritime, chiefdom, which, used, trade, networks, to, keep, power, centralized, around, the, king, s, capital, polynesians, on, outrigger, canoes, discovered, and, colonized, some, of, the, last, uninhabited, islands, of, earth, hawaii, new, zealand, and, easter, island, were, among, the, final, places, to, be, reached, settlers, discovering, pristine, lands, oral, tradition, claimed, that, navigator, ui, te, rangiora, discovered, icebergs, in, the, southern, ocean, in, exploring, and, settling, polynesian, settlers, did, not, strike, at, random, but, used, their, knowledge, of, wind, and, water, currents, to, reach, their, destinations, on, the, settled, islands, some, polynesian, groups, became, distinct, from, one, another, a, significant, example, being, the, maori, of, new, zealand, other, island, systems, kept, in, contact, with, each, other, including, hawaii, and, the, tahiti, goods, in, long, distance, trade, included, basalt, and, pearl, shell, ecologically, polynesians, had, the, challenge, of, sustaining, themselves, within, limited, environments, some, settlements, caused, mass, extinctions, of, some, native, plant, and, animal, species, over, time, by, hunting, species, such, as, the, moa, and, introducing, the, polynesian, rat, easter, island, settlers, engaged, in, complete, ecological, destruction, of, their, habtiat, and, their, population, crashed, afterwards, possibly, due, to, the, construction, of, the, easter, island, statues, other, colonizing, groups, adapted, to, accommodate, to, the, ecology, of, specific, islands, such, as, the, moriori, of, the, chatham, islands, europeans, on, their, voyages, visited, many, pacific, islands, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, but, most, areas, of, oceania, were, not, colonized, until, after, the, voyages, of, british, explorer, james, cook, in, the, 1780s, the, post, classical, era, of, the, americas, can, be, considered, set, at, a, different, time, span, from, that, of, afro, eurasia, as, the, developments, of, mesoamerican, and, andean, civilization, differ, greatly, from, that, of, the, old, world, as, well, as, the, speed, at, which, it, developed, the, post, classical, era, in, the, traditional, sense, does, not, take, place, until, near, the, end, of, the, medieval, age, in, western, europe, as, such, for, the, purposes, of, this, article, the, woodland, period, and, classic, stage, of, the, americas, will, be, discussed, here, which, takes, place, from, about, 400, to, 1400, for, the, technical, post, classical, stage, in, american, development, which, took, place, on, the, eve, of, european, contact, see, post, classic, stage, as, a, continent, there, was, little, unified, trade, or, communication, advances, in, agriculture, spread, northward, from, mesoamerica, indirectly, through, trade, major, cultural, areas, however, still, developed, independently, of, each, other, while, there, was, little, regular, contact, between, the, americas, and, the, old, world, the, norse, explored, and, even, colonized, greenland, and, canada, as, early, as, 1000, none, of, these, settlements, survived, past, medieval, times, outside, of, scandinavia, knowledge, of, the, discovery, of, the, americas, was, interpreted, as, a, remote, island, or, the, north, pole, the, norse, arriving, from, iceland, settled, greenland, from, approximately, 980, to, 1450, the, norse, arrived, in, southern, greenland, prior, to, the, 13th, century, approach, of, inuit, thule, people, in, the, area, the, extent, of, the, interaction, between, the, norse, and, thule, is, unclear, greenland, was, valuable, to, the, norse, due, to, trade, of, ivory, that, came, from, the, tusks, of, walruses, the, little, ice, age, adversely, affected, the, colonies, and, they, vanished, greenland, would, be, lost, to, europeans, until, danish, colonization, in, the, 18th, century, the, norse, also, explored, and, colonized, farther, south, in, newfoundland, canada, at, l, anse, aux, meadows, referred, to, by, the, norse, as, vinland, the, colony, at, most, existed, for, twenty, years, and, resulted, in, no, known, transmission, of, diseases, or, technology, to, the, first, nations, to, the, norse, vinland, was, known, for, plentiful, grape, vines, to, make, superior, wine, one, reason, for, the, colony, s, failure, was, constant, violence, with, the, native, beothuk, people, who, the, norse, referred, to, as, skr, lings, after, initial, expeditions, there, is, a, possibility, that, the, norse, continued, to, visit, modern, day, canada, surviving, records, from, medieval, iceland, indicate, some, sporadic, voyages, to, a, land, called, markland, possibly, the, coast, of, labrador, canada, as, late, as, 1347, presumably, to, collect, wood, for, deforested, greenland, in, north, america, many, hunter, gatherer, and, agricultural, societies, thrived, in, the, diverse, region, native, american, tribes, varied, greatly, in, characteristics, some, including, the, mound, builders, and, the, oasisamerican, cultures, were, complex, chiefdoms, other, nations, which, inhabited, the, states, of, the, modern, northern, united, states, and, canada, had, less, complexity, and, did, not, follow, technological, changes, as, quickly, approximately, around, the, year, 500, during, the, woodland, period, native, americans, began, to, transition, to, bows, and, arrows, from, spears, for, hunting, and, warfare, around, the, year, 1, 000, corn, was, widely, adopted, as, a, staple, crop, in, the, eastern, united, states, corn, would, continue, to, be, the, staple, crop, of, natives, in, the, eastern, united, states, and, canada, until, the, columbian, exchange, in, the, eastern, united, states, rivers, were, the, medium, of, trade, and, communication, cahokia, located, in, the, modern, u, s, state, of, illinois, was, among, the, most, significant, city, within, the, mississippian, culture, focused, around, monks, mound, archaeology, indicates, the, population, increased, exponentially, after, 1000, because, it, manufactured, important, tools, for, agriculture, and, hosted, cultural, attractions, around, 1350, cahokia, was, abandoned, environmental, factors, have, been, proposed, for, the, city, s, decline, at, the, same, time, ancestral, puebloans, constructed, clusters, of, buildings, in, the, chaco, canyon, site, located, in, the, state, of, new, mexico, individual, houses, may, have, been, occupied, by, more, than, 600, residents, at, any, one, time, chaco, canyon, was, the, only, pre, columbian, site, in, the, united, states, to, build, paved, roads, pottery, indicates, a, society, that, was, becoming, more, complex, turkeys, for, the, first, time, in, the, continental, united, states, were, also, domesticated, around, 1150, the, structures, of, chaco, canyon, were, abandoned, likely, as, a, result, of, severe, drought, there, were, also, other, pueblo, complexes, in, the, southwestern, united, states, like, the, cliff, palace, located, in, mesa, verde, national, park, after, reaching, climaxes, native, complex, societies, in, the, united, states, declined, and, did, not, entirely, recover, before, the, arrival, of, european, explorers, concentrating, a, significant, number, of, islands, the, caribbean, had, been, the, scene, of, constant, maritime, migrations, via, canoes, since, the, lithic, stage, with, its, first, inhabitants, reaching, the, area, by, around, 5000, bce, after, a, millennia, of, population, flows, the, various, peoples, of, the, caribbean, entered, in, the, post, classical, period, with, notable, developments, on, numerous, permanent, settlements, and, more, complex, social, organizations, which, were, a, result, of, the, improvement, of, agricultural, techniques, and, also, the, considerable, growth, of, villages, that, became, great, ceremonial, and, commercial, centers, led, by, different, cacique, trading, goods, like, shells, cotton, gold, colored, stones, and, rare, feathers, were, largely, exported, from, island, to, island, ranging, from, the, lesser, to, the, great, antilles, by, around, 650, c, e, and, 800, c, e, new, migratory, waves, from, the, caribbean, coast, of, present, day, venezuela, took, place, and, several, people, began, a, process, of, major, cultural, sociopolitical, and, ritual, reformulations, which, led, to, the, formation, of, the, first, chiefdoms, and, the, emergence, of, social, hierarchy, this, period, can, also, be, described, by, the, expulsion, of, the, ancient, saladoid, peoples, from, the, main, islands, of, the, caribbean, and, their, subsequent, replacement, by, the, newly, arrived, ta, no, people, who, fiercely, competed, with, other, arawak, speaking, groups, for, arable, land, and, war, captives, despite, little, evidence, some, scholars, still, claim, that, the, ta, no, may, have, had, a, tenuous, influence, from, the, maya, civilization, as, certain, customs, such, as, the, practice, of, batey, may, have, been, inherited, from, the, original, mesoamerican, ballgame, which, also, carried, a, religious, character, when, christopher, columbus, landed, in, the, bahamas, in, 1492, he, and, his, crew, initially, maintained, a, peaceful, contact, with, the, local, ta, no, people, but, soon, afterwards, they, were, enslaved, by, the, spanish, colonizers, bringing, the, area, into, the, early, modern, period, at, the, beginning, of, the, global, post, classical, period, the, city, of, teotihuacan, was, at, its, zenith, housing, over, 125, 000, people, at, 500, a, d, it, was, the, sixth, largest, city, in, the, world, at, the, time, the, city, s, residents, built, the, pyramid, of, the, sun, the, third, largest, pyramid, of, the, world, oriented, to, follow, astronomical, events, suddenly, in, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, the, city, suddenly, declined, possibly, as, a, result, of, severe, environmental, damage, caused, by, extreme, weather, events, of, 535, 536, there, is, evidence, that, large, parts, of, the, city, were, burned, possibly, in, a, domestic, rebellion, the, city, s, legacy, would, inspire, all, future, civilizations, in, the, region, at, the, same, time, was, classic, age, of, the, maya, civilization, clustered, in, dozens, of, city, states, on, the, yucat, n, and, modern, day, guatemala, the, most, significant, of, these, cities, was, chichen, itza, which, often, fiercely, competed, with, anywhere, from, 60, to, 80, city, states, to, be, the, dominant, economic, influence, in, the, region, likewise, other, mayan, cities, such, as, tikal, and, calakmul, also, initiated, a, series, of, full, scale, conflicts, in, the, area, over, power, and, prestige, culminating, in, the, tikal, calakmul, wars, in, the, 6th, century, the, mayans, had, an, upper, caste, of, priests, who, were, well, versed, in, astronomy, mathematics, and, writing, the, mayan, developed, the, concept, of, zero, and, a, 365, day, calendar, which, possibly, pre, dates, its, creation, in, old, world, societies, after, 900, many, mayan, cities, suddenly, declined, due, to, ecological, disaster, which, was, likely, caused, by, a, combination, of, drought, and, an, incessant, cycle, of, warfare, it, s, also, been, noted, that, classical, mayan, cities, lacked, food, storage, facilities, the, toltec, empire, arose, from, the, toltec, culture, and, were, remembered, as, wise, and, benevolent, leaders, one, priest, king, called, ce, acatl, topiltzin, advocated, against, human, sacrifice, after, his, death, in, 947, civil, wars, of, religious, character, broke, out, between, those, who, supported, and, opposed, topiltzin, s, teachings, modern, historians, however, are, skeptical, of, the, extent, of, toltec, and, influence, and, believe, that, much, of, the, information, known, about, the, toltecs, was, created, by, the, later, aztecs, as, an, inspiration, myth, in, the, 1300s, a, small, band, of, violent, religious, radicals, called, the, aztecs, began, minor, raids, throughout, the, area, eventually, they, began, to, claim, connections, with, the, toltec, civilization, and, insisted, they, were, the, rightful, successors, they, began, to, grow, in, numbers, and, conquer, large, areas, of, land, fundamental, to, their, conquest, was, the, use, of, political, terror, in, the, sense, that, the, aztec, leaders, and, priests, would, command, the, human, sacrifice, of, their, subjugated, people, as, means, of, humility, and, coercion, most, of, the, mesoamerican, region, would, eventually, fall, under, the, aztec, empire, on, the, yucat, n, peninsula, most, of, the, maya, peoples, continued, to, be, independent, of, the, aztecs, but, their, traditional, civilization, declined, aztec, developments, expanded, cultivation, applying, the, use, of, chinampas, irrigation, and, terrace, agriculture, important, crops, included, maize, sweet, potatoes, and, avocados, in, 1430, the, city, of, tenochtitlan, allied, with, other, powerful, nahuatl, speaking, cities, texcoco, and, tlacopan, to, create, the, aztec, empire, otherwise, known, as, the, triple, alliance, though, referred, to, as, an, empire, the, aztec, empire, functioned, as, a, system, of, tribute, collection, with, tenochtitlan, at, its, center, by, the, turn, of, the, 16th, century, flower, wars, between, the, aztecs, and, rival, states, such, as, tlaxcala, had, continued, for, over, fifty, years, south, american, civilization, was, concentrated, in, the, andean, region, which, had, already, hosted, complex, cultures, since, 2, 500, bce, east, of, the, andean, region, societies, were, generally, semi, nomadic, discoveries, on, the, amazon, river, basin, indicate, the, region, likely, had, a, pre, contact, population, of, five, million, people, and, hosted, complex, societies, around, the, continent, numerous, agricultural, peoples, from, colombia, to, argentina, steadily, advanced, through, numerous, stages, of, development, from, 500, ce, until, european, contact, during, ancient, times, the, andes, had, developed, civilizations, independent, of, outside, influences, including, that, of, mesoamerica, through, the, post, classical, era, a, cycle, of, civilizations, continued, until, spanish, contact, collectively, andean, societies, lacked, currency, a, written, language, and, solid, draft, animals, enjoyed, by, old, world, civilizations, instead, andeans, developed, other, methods, to, foster, their, growth, including, use, of, the, quipu, system, to, communicate, messages, llamas, to, carry, smaller, loads, and, an, economy, based, on, reciprocity, societies, were, often, based, on, strict, social, hierarchies, and, economic, redistribution, from, the, ruling, class, in, the, first, half, of, the, post, classical, period, the, andes, was, dominated, by, two, almost, equally, powerful, states, in, the, north, of, peru, was, the, wari, empire, and, in, the, south, of, peru, and, bolivia, there, was, the, tiwanaku, empire, both, of, whom, were, inspired, by, the, earlier, moche, people, while, the, extent, of, their, relationship, to, each, other, is, unknown, it, is, believed, that, they, competed, with, one, another, but, avoided, direct, conflict, without, war, there, was, prosperity, and, around, the, year, 700, tiwanaku, city, hosted, a, population, of, 1, 4, million, after, the, 8th, century, both, states, declined, due, to, changing, environmental, conditions, laying, the, ground, work, for, the, incas, and, other, minor, kingdoms, to, emerge, as, distinct, cultures, centuries, later, in, the, 15th, century, the, inca, empire, rose, to, annex, all, other, nations, in, the, area, led, by, their, sun, god, king, sapa, inca, they, slowly, conquered, what, is, now, peru, and, built, their, society, throughout, the, andes, cultural, region, the, incas, spoke, the, quechua, languages, taking, advantage, of, ancient, advances, left, by, previous, andean, societies, the, incas, were, able, to, create, the, most, advanced, system, of, trade, routes, of, south, america, known, as, the, inca, road, system, which, allowed, greater, interconnection, between, the, conquered, provinces, incas, have, been, known, to, have, used, abacuses, to, calculate, mathematics, the, inca, empire, is, known, for, some, of, its, magnificent, structures, such, as, machu, picchu, in, the, cusco, region, the, empire, expanded, quickly, northwards, to, ecuador, southwards, to, central, chile, to, the, north, of, the, inca, empire, remained, the, independent, tairona, and, muisca, confederation, who, practiced, agriculture, and, gold, metallurgy, as, the, post, classical, era, drew, to, a, close, in, the, 15th, century, many, of, the, empires, established, throughout, the, period, were, in, decline, the, byzantine, empire, would, soon, be, overshadowed, in, the, mediterranean, by, both, islamic, and, christian, rivals, including, venice, genoa, and, the, ottoman, empire, the, byzantines, faced, repeated, attacks, from, eastern, and, western, powers, during, the, fourth, crusade, and, declined, further, until, the, loss, of, constantinople, to, the, ottomans, in, 1453, the, largest, change, came, in, terms, of, trade, and, technology, the, global, significance, of, the, fall, of, the, byzantines, was, the, disruption, of, overland, routes, between, asia, and, europe, traditional, dominance, of, nomadism, in, eurasia, declined, and, the, pax, mongolica, which, had, allowed, for, interactions, between, different, civilizations, was, no, longer, available, west, asia, and, south, asia, were, conquered, by, gunpowder, empires, which, successfully, used, advances, in, military, technology, but, closed, the, silk, road, europeans, specifically, the, portuguese, and, various, italian,
