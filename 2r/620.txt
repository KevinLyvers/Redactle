with, their, corpses, i, filled, the, streets, of, the, city, a, full, and, characteristic, set, shows, the, campaign, leading, up, to, the, siege, of, lachish, in, 701, it, is, the, finest, from, the, reign, of, sennacherib, and, now, in, the, british, museum, he, later, wrote, about, a, battle, in, lachish, and, hezekiah, of, judah, who, had, not, submitted, to, my, yoke, him, i, shut, up, in, jerusalem, his, royal, city, like, a, caged, bird, earthworks, i, threw, up, against, him, and, anyone, coming, out, of, his, city, gate, i, made, pay, for, his, crime, his, cities, which, i, had,

elaborate, system, of, eighteen, canals, brought, water, from, the, hills, to, nineveh, and, several, sections, of, a, magnificently, constructed, aqueduct, erected, by, sennacherib, were, discovered, at, jerwan, about, 65, kilometres, 40, mi, distant, the, enclosed, area, had, more, than, 100, 000, inhabitants, maybe, closer, to, 150, 000, about, twice, as, many, as, babylon, at, the, time, placing, it, among, the, largest, settlements, worldwide, some, scholars, such, as, stephanie, dalley, at, oxford, believe, that, the, garden, which, sennacherib, built, next, to, his, palace, with, its, associated, irrigation, works, were, the, original, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, dalley, s, argument, is, based, on, a, disputation, of, the, traditional, placement, of, the, hanging, gardens, attributed, to, berossus, together, with, a, combination, of, literary, and, archaeological, evidence, the, greatness, of, nineveh, was, short, lived, in, around, 627, bc, after, the, death, of, its, last, great, king, ashurbanipal, the, neo, assyrian, empire, began, to, unravel, through, a, series, of, bitter, civil, wars, between, rival, claimants, for, the, throne, and, in, 616, bc, assyria, was, attacked, by, its, own, former, vassals, the, chaldean, babylonians, medes, and, scythians, in, about, 616, bc, kalhu, was, sacked, the, allied, forces, eventually, reached, nineveh, besieging, and, sacking, the, city, in, 612, bc, following, bitter, house, to, house, fighting, after, which, it, was, razed, most, of, the, people, in, the, city, who, could, not, escape, to, the, last, assyrian, strongholds, in, the, north, and, west, were, either, massacred, or, deported, out, of, the, city, and, into, the, countryside, where, they, founded, new, settlements, many, unburied, skeletons, were, found, by, the, archaeologists, at, the, site, the, assyrian, empire, then, came, to, an, end, by, 605, bc, the, medes, and, babylonians, dividing, its, colonies, between, themselves, it, is, not, clear, whether, nineveh, came, under, the, rule, of, the, medes, or, the, neo, babylonian, empire, in, 612, the, babylonian, chronicle, concerning, the, fall, of, nineveh, records, that, nineveh, was, turned, into, mounds, and, heaps, but, this, is, literary, hyperbole, the, complete, destruction, of, nineveh, has, traditionally, been, seen, as, confirmed, by, the, hebrew, book, of, ezekiel, and, the, greek, retreat, of, the, ten, thousand, of, xenophon, d, 354, bc, there, are, no, later, cuneiform, tablets, in, akkadian, from, nineveh, although, devastated, in, 612, the, city, was, not, completely, abandoned, yet, to, the, greek, historians, ctesias, and, herodotus, c, 400, bc, nineveh, was, a, thing, of, the, past, and, when, xenophon, passed, the, place, in, the, 4th, century, bc, he, described, it, as, abandoned, the, earliest, piece, of, written, evidence, for, the, persistence, of, nineveh, as, a, settlement, is, possibly, the, cyrus, cylinder, of, 539, 538, bc, but, the, reading, of, this, is, disputed, if, correctly, read, as, nineveh, it, indicates, that, cyrus, the, great, restored, the, temple, of, ishtar, at, nineveh, and, probably, encouraged, resettlement, a, number, of, cuneiform, elamite, tablets, have, been, found, at, nineveh, they, probably, date, from, the, time, of, the, revival, of, elam, in, the, century, following, the, collapse, of, assyria, the, hebrew, book, of, jonah, which, stephanie, dalley, asserts, was, written, in, the, 4th, century, bc, is, an, account, of, the, city, s, repentance, and, god, s, mercy, which, prevented, destruction, archaeologically, there, is, evidence, of, repairs, at, the, temple, of, nabu, after, 612, and, for, the, continued, use, of, sennacherib, s, palace, there, is, evidence, of, syncretic, hellenistic, cults, a, statue, of, hermes, has, been, found, and, a, greek, inscription, attached, to, a, shrine, of, the, sebitti, a, statue, of, herakles, epitrapezios, dated, to, the, 2nd, century, ad, has, also, been, found, the, library, of, ashurbanipal, may, still, have, been, in, use, until, around, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, the, city, was, actively, resettled, under, the, seleucid, empire, there, is, evidence, of, more, changes, in, sennacherib, s, palace, under, the, parthian, empire, the, parthians, also, established, a, municipal, mint, at, nineveh, coining, in, bronze, according, to, tacitus, in, ad, 50, meherdates, a, claimant, to, the, parthian, throne, with, roman, support, took, nineveh, by, late, antiquity, nineveh, was, restricted, to, the, east, bank, of, the, tigris, and, the, west, bank, was, uninhabited, under, the, sasanian, empire, nineveh, was, not, an, administrative, centre, by, the, 2nd, century, ad, there, were, christians, present, and, by, 554, it, was, a, bishopric, of, the, church, of, the, east, king, khosrow, ii, 591, 628, built, a, fortress, on, the, west, bank, and, two, christian, monasteries, were, constructed, around, 570, and, 595, this, growing, settlement, was, not, called, mosul, until, after, the, arab, conquests, it, may, have, been, called, hesn, ebr, y, jews, fort, in, 627, the, city, was, the, site, of, the, battle, of, nineveh, between, the, eastern, roman, empire, and, the, sasanians, in, 641, it, was, conquered, by, the, arabs, who, built, a, mosque, on, the, west, bank, and, turned, it, into, an, administrative, centre, under, the, umayyad, dynasty, mosul, eclipsed, nineveh, which, was, reduced, to, a, christian, suburb, with, limited, new, construction, by, the, 13th, century, nineveh, was, mostly, ruins, and, was, subsequently, absorbed, into, mosul, a, church, was, converted, into, a, muslim, shrine, to, the, prophet, jonah, which, continued, to, attract, pilgrims, until, its, destruction, by, isil, in, 2014, the, modern, city, of, mosul, is, occasionally, referred, to, as, nineveh, such, as, during, the, operation, to, retake, mosul, in, 2016, 17, in, the, hebrew, bible, nineveh, is, first, mentioned, in, genesis, 10, 11, ashur, left, that, land, and, built, nineveh, some, modern, english, translations, interpret, ashur, in, the, hebrew, of, this, verse, as, the, country, assyria, rather, than, a, person, thus, making, nimrod, rather, than, ashur, the, founder, of, nineveh, sir, walter, raleigh, s, notion, that, nimrod, built, nineveh, has, been, disputed, by, eighteenth, century, scholar, samuel, shuckford, the, discovery, of, the, fifteen, jubilees, texts, found, amongst, the, dead, sea, scrolls, has, since, shown, that, according, to, the, jewish, sects, of, qumran, genesis, 10, 11, affirms, the, apportionment, of, nineveh, to, ashur, the, attribution, of, nineveh, to, ashur, is, also, supported, by, the, greek, septuagint, king, james, bible, geneva, bible, and, by, roman, historian, flavius, josephus, in, his, antiquities, of, the, jews, antiquities, i, vi, 4, nineveh, was, the, flourishing, capital, of, the, assyrian, empire, and, was, the, home, of, king, sennacherib, king, of, assyria, during, the, biblical, reign, of, king, hezekiah, and, the, lifetime, of, judean, prophet, isaiah, as, recorded, in, hebrew, scripture, nineveh, was, also, the, place, where, sennacherib, died, at, the, hands, of, his, two, sons, who, then, fled, to, the, vassal, land, of, rrt, urartu, the, book, of, the, prophet, nahum, is, almost, exclusively, taken, up, with, prophetic, denunciations, against, nineveh, its, ruin, and, utter, desolation, are, foretold, its, end, was, strange, sudden, and, tragic, according, to, the, bible, it, was, god, s, doing, his, judgment, on, assyria, s, pride, in, fulfillment, of, prophecy, god, made, an, utter, end, of, the, place, it, became, a, desolation, the, prophet, zephaniah, also, predicts, its, destruction, along, with, the, fall, of, the, empire, of, which, it, was, the, capital, nineveh, is, also, the, setting, of, the, book, of, tobit, the, book, of, jonah, set, in, the, days, of, the, assyrian, empire, describes, it, as, an, exceedingly, great, city, of, three, days, journey, in, breadth, whose, population, at, that, time, is, given, as, more, than, 120, 000, genesis, 10, 11, 12, lists, four, cities, nineveh, rehoboth, calah, and, resen, ambiguously, stating, that, either, resen, or, calah, is, the, great, city, the, ruins, of, kuyunjiq, nimrud, karamlesh,
