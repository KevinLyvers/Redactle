european, integration, is, the, process, of, industrial, economic, political, legal, social, and, cultural, integration, of, states, wholly, or, partially, in, europe, or, nearby, european, integration, has, primarily, but, not, exclusively, come, about, through, the, european, union, and, its, policies, the, history, of, european, integration, is, marked, by, the, roman, empire, s, consolidation, of, european, and, mediterranean, territories, which, set, a, precedent, for, the, notion, of, a, unified, europe, this, idea, was, echoed, through, attempts, at, unity, such, as, the, holy, roman, empire, the, hanseatic, league, and, the, napoleonic, empire, the, devastation, of, world, war, i, reignited, the, concept, of, a, unified, europe, leading, to, the, establishment, of, international, organizations, aimed, at, political, coordination, across, europe, the, interwar, period, saw, politicians, such, as, richard, von, coudenhove, kalergi, and, aristide, briand, advocating, for, european, unity, albeit, with, differing, visions, post, world, war, ii, europe, saw, a, significant, push, towards, integration, with, winston, churchill, s, call, for, a, united, states, of, europe, in, 1946, being, a, notable, example, this, period, saw, the, formation, of, theories, around, european, integration, categorizing, into, proto, integration, explaining, integration, analyzing, governance, and, constructing, the, eu, reflecting, a, shift, from, viewing, european, integration, as, a, unique, process, to, incorporating, broader, international, relations, and, comparative, politics, theories, citizens, organizations, have, played, a, role, in, advocating, further, european, integration, exemplified, by, the, union, of, european, federalists, and, the, european, movement, international, various, agreements, and, memberships, demonstrate, the, web, of, relations, and, commitments, between, european, countries, showing, the, multi, layered, nature, of, integration, in, antiquity, the, roman, empire, brought, about, integration, of, multiple, european, and, mediterranean, territories, the, numerous, subsequent, claims, of, succession, of, the, roman, empire, even, the, iterations, of, the, classical, empire, and, its, ancient, peoples, have, occasionally, been, reinterpreted, in, the, light, of, post, 1950, european, integration, as, providing, inspiration, and, historical, precedents, important, examples, include, the, holy, roman, empire, the, hanseatic, league, the, peace, of, westphalia, the, napoleonic, empire, and, the, unification, of, germany, italy, and, the, balkans, as, well, as, the, latin, monetary, union, following, the, catastrophe, of, the, first, world, war, of, 1914, 1918, thinkers, and, visionaries, from, a, range, of, political, traditions, again, began, to, float, the, idea, of, a, politically, unified, europe, in, the, early, 1920s, a, range, of, international, organisations, were, founded, or, re, founded, to, help, like, minded, political, parties, to, coordinate, their, activities, these, ranged, from, the, comintern, 1919, to, the, labour, and, socialist, international, 1921, to, the, radical, and, democratic, entente, of, centre, left, progressive, parties, 1924, to, the, green, international, of, farmers, parties, 1923, to, the, centre, right, international, secretariat, of, democratic, parties, inspired, by, christianity, 1925, while, the, remit, of, these, international, bodies, was, global, the, predominance, of, political, parties, from, europe, meant, that, they, facilitated, interaction, between, the, adherents, of, a, given, ideology, across, european, borders, within, each, political, tradition, voices, emerged, advocating, not, merely, the, cooperation, of, various, national, parties, but, the, pursuit, of, political, institutions, at, the, european, level, one, of, the, first, to, articulate, this, view, was, richard, von, coudenhove, kalergi, who, outlined, a, conservative, vision, of, european, unity, in, his, pan, europa, manifesto, 1923, the, first, paneuropean, congress, took, place, in, vienna, in, 1926, and, the, association, possessed, 8000, members, by, the, time, of, the, 1929, wall, street, crash, they, envisaged, a, specifically, christian, and, by, implication, catholic, europe, the, british, civil, servant, and, future, conservative, minister, arthur, salter, published, a, book, advocating, the, united, states, of, europe, in, 1933, in, contrast, the, soviet, commissar, minister, leon, trotsky, raised, the, slogan, for, a, soviet, united, states, of, europe, in, 1923, advocating, a, europe, united, along, communist, principles, among, liberal, democratic, parties, the, french, centre, left, undertook, several, initiatives, to, group, like, minded, parties, from, the, european, states, in, 1927, the, french, mathematician, and, politician, mile, borel, a, leader, of, the, centre, left, radical, party, and, the, founder, of, the, radical, international, set, up, a, french, committee, for, european, cooperation, and, a, further, twenty, countries, set, up, equivalent, committees, however, it, remained, an, lite, venture, the, largest, committee, the, french, one, possessed, fewer, than, six, hundred, members, two, thirds, of, them, parliamentarians, two, centre, left, french, prime, ministers, went, further, in, 1929, aristide, briand, gave, a, speech, in, the, presence, of, the, league, of, nations, assembly, in, which, he, proposed, the, idea, of, a, federation, of, european, nations, based, on, solidarity, and, in, the, pursuit, of, economic, prosperity, and, political, and, social, co, operation, in, 1930, at, the, league, s, request, briand, presented, a, memorandum, on, the, organisation, of, a, system, of, european, federal, union, the, next, year, the, future, french, prime, minister, douard, herriot, published, his, book, the, united, states, of, europe, indeed, a, template, for, such, a, system, already, existed, in, the, form, of, the, 1921, belgian, and, luxembourgish, customs, and, monetary, union, support, for, the, proposals, by, the, french, centre, left, came, from, a, range, of, prestigious, figures, many, eminent, economists, aware, that, the, economic, race, to, the, bottom, between, states, was, creating, ever, greater, instability, supported, the, view, these, included, john, maynard, keynes, the, french, political, scientist, and, economist, bertrand, jouvenel, remembered, a, widespread, mood, after, 1924, calling, for, a, harmonisation, of, national, interests, along, the, lines, of, european, union, for, the, purpose, of, common, prosperity, the, spanish, philosopher, and, politician, ortega, y, gasset, expressed, a, position, shared, by, many, within, republican, spain, european, unity, is, no, fantasy, but, reality, itself, and, the, fantasy, is, precisely, the, opposite, the, belief, that, france, germany, italy, or, spain, are, substantive, independent, realities, eleftherios, venizelos, prime, minister, of, greece, outlined, his, government, s, support, in, a, 1929, speech, by, saying, that, the, united, states, of, europe, will, represent, even, without, russia, a, power, strong, enough, to, advance, up, to, a, satisfactory, point, the, prosperity, of, the, other, continents, as, well, between, the, two, world, wars, the, polish, statesman, j, zef, pi, sudski, 1867, 1935, envisaged, the, idea, of, a, european, federation, that, he, called, mi, dzymorze, intersea, or, between, seas, known, in, english, as, intermarium, which, was, a, polish, oriented, version, of, mitteleuropa, the, great, depression, the, rise, of, fascism, and, communism, and, subsequently, world, war, ii, prevented, the, inter, war, movements, from, gaining, further, support, between, 1933, and, 1936, most, of, europe, s, remaining, democracies, became, dictatorships, and, ortega, s, spain, and, venizelos, s, greece, had, both, plunged, into, civil, war, but, although, the, social, democratic, liberal, or, christian, democratic, supporters, of, european, unity, were, out, of, power, during, the, 1930s, and, unable, to, put, their, ideas, into, practice, many, would, find, themselves, in, power, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, and, better, placed, to, put, into, effect, their, earlier, remedies, against, economic, and, political, crisis, during, world, war, ii, 1939, 1945, nazi, germany, came, to, dominate, directly, or, indirectly, much, of, europe, at, various, times, the, plans, for, german, oriented, political, social, and, economic, integration, of, europe, such, as, the, new, order, the, greater, germanic, reich, and, generalplan, ost, did, not, survive, the, war, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, continental, political, climate, favoured, unity, in, democratic, european, countries, seen, by, many, as, an, escape, from, the, extreme, forms, of, nationalism, which, had, devastated, the, continent, in, a, speech, delivered, on, 19, september, 1946, at, the, university, of, z, rich, in, switzerland, winston, churchill, postulated, a, united, states, of, europe, the, same, speech, however, contains, remarks, less, often, quoted, which, make, it, clear, that, churchill, did, not, initially, see, britain, as, being, part, of, this, united, states, of, europe, we, british, have, our, own, commonwealth, of, nations, and, why, should, there, not, be, a, european, group, which, could, give, a, sense, of, enlarged, patriotism, and, common, citizenship, to, the, distracted, peoples, of, this, turbulent, and, mighty, continent, and, why, should, it, not, take, its, rightful, place, with, other, great, groupings, in, shaping, the, destinies, of, men, france, and, germany, must, take, the, lead, together, great, britain, the, british, commonwealth, of, nations, mighty, america, and, i, trust, soviet, russia, for, then, indeed, all, would, be, well, must, be, the, friends, and, sponsors, of, the, new, europe, and, must, champion, its, right, to, live, and, shine, we, must, build, a, kind, of, united, states, of, europe, in, this, way, only, will, hundreds, of, millions, of, toilers, be, able, to, regain, the, simple, joys, and, hopes, which, make, life, worth, living, european, integration, scholars, thomas, diez, and, antje, wiener, identify, the, general, tendencies, in, the, development, of, european, integration, theory, and, suggest, to, divide, theories, of, integration, into, three, broad, phases, which, are, preceded, by, a, normative, proto, integration, theory, period, there, s, a, gradual, shift, from, theories, studying, european, integration, as, sui, generis, towards, new, approaches, that, incorporate, theories, of, international, relations, and, comparative, politics, the, question, of, how, to, avoid, wars, between, the, nation, states, was, essential, for, the, first, theories, federalism, and, functionalism, proposed, the, containment, of, the, nation, state, while, transactionalism, sought, to, theorise, the, conditions, for, the, stabilisation, of, the, nation, state, system, early, federalism, was, more, like, a, political, movement, calling, for, european, federation, by, various, political, actors, for, example, altiero, spinelli, calling, for, a, federal, europe, in, his, ventotene, manifesto, and, paul, val, ry, envisioning, european, civilization, for, unity, state, sovereignty, was, an, issue, for, federalists, who, hoped, political, organizations, at, higher, regional, level, would, solve, the, issue, a, representative, scholar, of, functionalism, was, david, mitrany, who, also, saw, states, and, their, sovereignty, as, a, core, problem, and, believed, that, one, should, restrain, states, to, prevent, future, wars, however, mitrany, disagreed, with, regional, integration, as, he, viewed, it, as, mere, replication, of, the, state, model, transactionalism, on, the, other, hand, sees, increased, cross, border, exchanges, as, promoting, regional, integration, so, that, the, risk, of, war, is, reduced, european, integration, theory, initially, focused, on, explaining, integration, process, of, supranational, institution, building, one, of, the, most, influential, theories, of, european, integration, is, neofunctionalism, influenced, by, functionalist, ideas, developed, by, ernst, b, haas, 1958, and, further, investigated, by, leon, lindberg, 1963, this, theory, focuses, on, spillovers, of, integration, where, well, integrated, and, interdependent, areas, led, to, more, integration, neofunctionalism, well, captures, the, spillover, from, the, european, coal, and, steel, community, to, the, european, economic, community, established, in, the, 1957, treaties, of, rome, transfers, of, loyalties, from, the, national, level, to, the, supranational, level, is, expected, to, occur, as, integration, progresses, the, other, big, influential, theory, in, integration, studies, is, intergovernmentalism, advanced, by, stanley, hoffmann, after, the, empty, chair, crisis, by, french, president, charles, de, gaulle, in, the, 1960s, intergovernmentalism, and, later, liberal, intergovernmentalism, developed, in, the, 1980s, by, andrew, moravcsik, focus, on, governmental, actors, impacts, that, are, enhanced, by, supranational, institutions, but, not, restrained, from, them, the, important, debate, between, neofunctionalism, and, liberal, intergovernmentalism, still, remains, central, in, understanding, the, development, and, setbacks, of, the, european, integration, as, the, empirical, world, has, changed, so, have, the, theories, and, thus, the, understanding, of, european, integration, the, second, generation, of, integration, theorists, focused, on, the, importance, of, institutions, and, their, impacts, on, both, integration, process, and, european, governance, development, the, second, phase, brought, in, perspectives, from, comparative, politics, in, addition, to, traditional, international, relations, theoretical, references, studies, attempted, to, understand, what, kind, of, polity, the, eu, is, and, how, it, operates, for, example, new, theory, multi, level, governance, mlg, was, developed, to, understand, the, workings, and, development, of, the, eu, the, third, phase, of, integration, theory, marked, a, return, of, international, relations, theory, with, the, rise, of, critical, and, constructivist, approaches, in, the, 1990s, perspectives, from, social, constructivists, post, structuralists, critical, theories, feminist, theories, are, incorporated, in, integration, theories, to, conceptualize, european, integration, process, of, widening, and, deepening, various, federalist, organisations, have, been, created, over, time, supporting, the, idea, of, a, federal, europe, these, include, the, union, of, european, federalists, the, young, european, federalists, the, european, movement, international,

results, of, the, empirical, socioeconomic, analyses, suggest, that, in, spain, france, ireland, and, the, netherlands, the, immigration, from, cee, had, negative, effects, on, support, for, european, integration, in, the, host, societies, the, research, also, implies, that, the, immigration, from, the, cee, seems, to, undermine, the, long, term, effects, of, the, integration, there, are, theories, for, the, programs, of, social, development, that, range, in, views, from, an, extended, contact, with, the, immigrants, from, eastern, europe, might, help, forge, a, common, european, identity, and, it, could, also, lead, to, a, potential, national, isolation, caused, by, tightening, support, mechanisms, for, the, labor, immigration, equal, amount, of, research, also, implies, that, the,
