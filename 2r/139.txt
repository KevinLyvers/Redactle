the, yayoi, period, yayoi, jidai, started, in, the, late, neolithic, period, in, japan, continued, through, the, bronze, age, and, towards, its, end, crossed, into, the, iron, age, since, the, 1980s, scholars, have, argued, that, a, period, previously, classified, as, a, transition, from, the, j, mon, period, should, be, reclassified, as, early, yayoi, the, date, of, the, beginning, of, this, transition, is, controversial, with, estimates, ranging, from, the, 10th, to, the, 3rd, centuries, bc, the, period, is, named, after, the, neighbourhood, of, tokyo, where, archaeologists, first, uncovered, artifacts, and, features, from, that, era, in, the, late, 19th, century, distinguishing, characteristics, of, the, yayoi, period, include, the, appearance, of, new, yayoi, pottery, styles, improved, carpentry, and, architecture, and, the, start, of, an, intensive, rice, agriculture, in, paddy, fields, a, hierarchical, social, class, structure, dates, from, this, period, and, has, its, origin, in, china, techniques, in, metallurgy, based, on, the, use, of, bronze, and, iron, were, also, introduced, from, china, via, korea, to, japan, in, this, period, the, yayoi, followed, the, j, mon, period, and, yayoi, culture, flourished, in, a, geographic, area, from, southern, ky, sh, to, northern, honsh, archaeological, evidence, supports, the, idea, that, during, this, time, an, influx, of, farmers, yayoi, people, from, the, korean, peninsula, to, japan, overwhelmed, and, mixed, with, the, native, predominantly, hunter, gatherer, population, j, mon, the, yayoi, period, is, generally, accepted, to, date, from, circa, 300, bc, to, 300, ad, however, although, highly, controversial, radiocarbon, evidence, from, organic, samples, attached, to, pottery, shards, may, suggest, a, date, up, to, 500, years, earlier, between, ca, 1000, bc, and, 800, bc, during, this, period, japan, largely, transitioned, to, a, more, settled, agricultural, society, adopting, methods, of, farming, and, crop, production, that, were, introduced, to, the, country, initially, in, the, ky, sh, region, from, korea, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, the, yayoi, period, is, found, on, northern, ky, sh, though, that, is, still, debated, yayoi, culture, quickly, spread, to, the, main, island, of, honsh, mixing, with, native, j, mon, culture, the, name, yayoi, is, borrowed, from, a, location, in, tokyo, where, pottery, of, the, yayoi, period, was, first, found, yayoi, pottery, was, simply, decorated, and, produced, using, the, same, coiling, technique, previously, used, in, j, mon, pottery, yayoi, craft, specialists, made, bronze, ceremonial, bells, d, taku, mirrors, and, weapons, by, the, 1st, century, ad, yayoi, people, began, using, iron, agricultural, tools, and, weapons, as, the, yayoi, population, increased, the, society, became, more, stratified, and, complex, they, wove, textiles, lived, in, permanent, farming, villages, and, constructed, buildings, with, wood, and, stone, they, also, accumulated, wealth, through, land, ownership, and, the, storage, of, grain, such, factors, promoted, the, development, of, distinct, social, classes, contemporary, chinese, sources, described, the, people, as, having, tattoos, and, other, bodily, markings, which, indicated, differences, in, social, status, yayoi, chiefs, in, some, parts, of, ky, sh, appear, to, have, sponsored, and, politically, manipulated, trade, in, bronze, and, other, prestige, objects, that, was, made, possible, by, the, introduction, of, an, irrigated, wet, rice, agriculture, from, the, yangtze, estuary, in, southern, china, via, the, ryukyu, islands, or, korean, peninsula, direct, comparisons, between, j, mon, and, yayoi, skeletons, show, that, the, two, peoples, are, noticeably, distinguishable, the, j, mon, tended, to, be, shorter, with, relatively, longer, forearms, and, lower, legs, more, deep, set, eyes, shorter, and, wider, faces, and, much, more, pronounced, facial, topography, they, also, have, strikingly, raised, brow, ridges, noses, and, nose, bridges, yayoi, people, on, the, other, hand, averaged, 2, 5, 5, cm, 0, 98, 1, 97, in, taller, with, shallow, set, eyes, high, and, narrow, faces, and, flat, brow, ridges, and, noses, by, the, kofun, period, almost, all, skeletons, excavated, in, japan, except, those, of, the, ainu, are, of, the, yayoi, type, with, some, having, small, j, mon, admixture, resembling, those, of, modern, day, japanese, the, origin, of, yayoi, culture, and, the, yayoi, people, has, long, been, debated, the, earliest, archaeological, sites, are, itazuke, or, nabata, in, the, northern, part, of, ky, sh, contacts, between, fishing, communities, on, this, coast, and, the, southern, coast, of, korea, date, from, the, j, mon, period, as, witnessed, by, the, exchange, of, trade, items, such, as, fishhooks, and, obsidian, during, the, yayoi, period, cultural, features, from, korea, and, china, arrived, in, this, area, at, various, times, over, several, centuries, and, later, spread, to, the, south, and, east, this, was, a, period, of, mixture, between, immigrants, and, the, indigenous, population, and, between, new, cultural, influences, and, existing, practices, chinese, influence, was, obvious, in, the, bronze, and, copper, weapons, d, ky, d, taku, as, well, as, irrigated, paddy, rice, cultivation, three, major, symbols, of, yayoi, culture, are, the, bronze, mirror, the, bronze, sword, and, the, royal, seal, stone, between, 1996, and, 1999, a, team, led, by, satoshi, yamaguchi, a, researcher, at, japan, s, national, museum, of, nature, and, science, compared, yayoi, remains, found, in, japan, s, yamaguchi, and, fukuoka, prefectures, with, those, from, china, s, coastal, jiangsu, province, and, found, many, similarities, between, the, yayoi, and, the, jiangsu, remains, further, links, to, the, korean, peninsula, have, been, discovered, and, several, researchers, have, reported, discoveries, evidence, that, strongly, link, the, yayoi, culture, to, the, southern, part, of, the, korean, peninsula, mark, j, hudson, has, cited, archaeological, evidence, that, included, bounded, paddy, fields, new, types, of, polished, stone, tools, wooden, farming, implements, iron, tools, weaving, technology, ceramic, storage, jars, exterior, bonding, of, clay, coils, in, pottery, fabrication, ditched, settlements, domesticated, pigs, and, jawbone, rituals, the, migrant, transfusion, from, the, korean, peninsula, gains, strength, because, yayoi, culture, began, on, the, north, coast, of, ky, sh, where, japan, is, closest, to, korea, yayoi, pottery, burial, mounds, and, food, preservation, were, discovered, to, be, very, similar, to, the, pottery, of, southern, korea, however, some, scholars, argue, that, the, rapid, increase, of, roughly, four, million, people, in, japan, between, the, j, mon, and, yayoi, periods, cannot, be, explained, by, migration, alone, they, attribute, the, increase, primarily, to, a, shift, from, a, hunter, gatherer, to, an, agricultural, diet, on, the, islands, with, the, introduction, of, rice, it, is, quite, likely, that, rice, cultivation, and, its, subsequent, deification, allowed, for, a, slow, and, gradual, population, increase, regardless, there, is, archaeological, evidence, that, supports, the, idea, that, there, was, an, influx, of, farmers, from, the, continent, to, japan, that, absorbed, or, overwhelmed, the, native, hunter, gatherer, population, some, pieces, of, yayoi, pottery, clearly, show, the, influence, of, j, mon, ceramics, in, addition, the, yayoi, lived, in, the, same, type, of, pit, or, circular, dwelling, as, that, of, the, j, mon, other, examples, of, commonality, are, chipped, stone, tools, for, hunting, bone, tools, for, fishing, shells, in, bracelet, construction, and, lacquer, decoration, for, vessels, and, accessories, according, to, several, linguists, japonic, or, proto, japonic, was, present, on, large, parts, of, the, southern, korean, peninsula, these, peninsular, japonic, languages, now, extinct, were, eventually, replaced, by, koreanic, languages, similarly, whitman, suggests, that, the, yayoi, are, not, related, to, the, proto, koreans, but, that, they, the, yayoi, were, present, on, the, korean, peninsula, during, the, mumun, pottery, period, according, to, him, and, several, other, researchers, japonic, proto, japonic, arrived, in, the, korean, peninsula, around, 1500, bc, and, was, brought, to, the, japanese, archipelago, by, yayoi, wet, rice, farmers, at, some, time, between, 700, and, 300, bc, whitman, and, miyamoto, associate, japonic, as, the, language, family, of, both, mumun, and, yayoi, cultures, several, linguists, believe, that, speakers, of, koreanic, proto, koreanic, arrived, in, the, korean, peninsula, at, some, time, after, the, japonic, proto, japonic, speakers, and, coexisted, with, these, peoples, i, e, the, descendants, of, both, the, mumun, and, yayoi, cultures, and, possibly, assimilated, them, both, koreanic, and, japonic, had, prolonged, influence, on, each, other, and, a, later, founder, effect, diminished, the, internal, variety, of, both, language, families, most, linguists, and, archaeologists, agree, that, the, japonic, language, family, was, introduced, to, and, spread, through, the, archipelago, during, the, yayoi, period, the, earliest, written, records, about, people, in, japan, are, from, chinese, sources, from, this, period, wo, the, pronunciation, of, an, early, chinese, name, for, japan, was, mentioned, in, 57, ad, the, na, state, of, wo, received, a, golden, seal, from, the, emperor, guangwu, of, the, later, han, dynasty, this, event, was, recorded, in, the, book, of, the, later, han, compiled, by, fan, ye, in, the, 5th, century, the, seal, itself, was, discovered, in, northern, ky, sh, in, the, 18th, century, wo, was, also, mentioned, in, 257, in, the, wei, zhi, a, section, of, the, records, of, the, three, kingdoms, compiled, by, the, 3rd, century, scholar, chen, shou, early, chinese, historians, described, wo, as, a, land, of, hundreds, of, scattered, tribal, communities, rather, than, the, unified, land, with, a, 700, year, tradition, as, laid, out, in, the, 8th, century, work, nihon, shoki, a, partly, mythical, partly, historical, account, of, japan, which, dates, the, foundation, of, the, country, at, 660, bc, archaeological, evidence, also, suggests, that, frequent, conflicts, between, settlements, or, statelets, broke, out, in, the, period, many, excavated, settlements, were, moated, or, built, at, the, tops, of, hills, headless, human, skeletons, discovered, in, yoshinogari, site, are, regarded, as, typical, examples, of, finds, from, the, period, in, the, coastal, area, of, the, inland, sea, stone, arrowheads, are, often, found, among, funerary, objects, third, century, chinese, sources, reported, that, the, wa, people, lived, on, raw, fish, vegetables, and, rice, served, on, bamboo, and, wooden, trays, clapped, their, hands, in, worship, something, still, done, in, shinto, shrines, today, and, built, earthen, grave, mounds, they, also, maintained, vassal, master, relations, collected, taxes, had, provincial, granaries, and, markets, and, observed, mourning, society, was, characterised, by, violent, struggles, the, wei, zhi, chinese, which, is, part, of, the, records, of, the, three, kingdoms, first, mentions, yamataikoku, and, queen, himiko, in, the, 3rd, century, according, to, the, record, himiko, assumed, the, throne, of, wa, as, a, spiritual, leader, after, a, major, civil, war, her, younger, brother, was, in, charge, of, the, affairs, of, state, including, diplomatic, relations, with, the, chinese, court, of, the, kingdom, of, wei, when, asked, about, their, origins, by, the, wei, embassy, the, people, of, wa, claimed, to, be, descendants, of, the, taibo, of, wu, a, historic, figure, of, the, wu, kingdom, around, the, yangtze, delta, of, china, for, many, years, the, location, of, yamataikoku, and, the, identity, of, queen, himiko, have, been, subject, of, research, two, possible, sites, yoshinogari, in, saga, prefecture, and, makimuku, in, nara, prefecture, have, been, suggested, recent, archaeological, research, in, makimuku, suggests, that, yamataikoku, was, located, in, the, area, some, scholars, assume, that, the, hashihaka, kofun, in, makimuku, was, the, tomb, of, himiko, its, relation, to, the, origin, of, the, yamato, polity, in, the, following, kofun, period, is, also, under, debate
