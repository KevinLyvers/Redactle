state, of, the, ussr, the, beneficiaries, of, the, turbulent, period, were, often, called, the, russian, oligarchs, in, the, beginning, of, the, 2000s, there, was, a, global, rise, in, prices, in,

of, the, developed, country, and, has, caused, a, pronounced, deceleration, of, economic, activity, the, global, recession, occurred, in, an, economic, environment, characterized, by, various,

ranging, economic, impacts, of, covid, 19, such, as, supply, chain, changes, and, an, increase, in, working, from, home, along, with, the, covid, 19, recession, social, changes, since, 1945, have, been, vast, and, disparate, affecting, countries, and, subgroups, within, those, countries, in, ways, specific, to, each, population, meaning, there, is, not, one, single, global, story, of, social, change, despite, this, one, of, the, major, trends, has, been, an, increasing, interchange, between, cultures, and, a, wider, spread, of, the, most, successful, works, enabled, by, new, technology, and, globalization, in, earlier, periods, a, successful, musician, or, theater, troupe, might, be, confined, to, playing, in, a, single, city, at, a, time, limiting, their, reach, the, spread, of, better, recording, technology, such, as, the, magnetophon, meant, that, a, musical, act, could, have, their, song, be, played, over, the, radio, everywhere, without, loss, of, sound, quality, creating, international, superstars, such, as, elvis, presley, and, the, beatles, the, spread, of, home, television, sets, allowed, people, across, the, globe, to, easily, watch, the, same, show, rather, than, requiring, viewers, to, attend, a, local, theater, hollywood, in, california, produced, films, that, dominated, cinema, while, intended, for, the, lucrative, american, market, these, films, spread, across, the, globe, backed, by, their, large, budgets, and, the, cinematic, expertise, gathered, there, the, rise, of, the, internet, in, the, 1990s, allowed, both, for, an, ever, further, spread, of, the, most, popular, and, dominant, works, but, the, comparatively, cheap, cost, of, publishing, there, whether, as, a, personal, website, blog, or, youtube, video, also, allowed, specific, niche, subcultures, to, connect, and, thrive, in, a, way, that, was, less, true, in, the, 20th, century, for, example, diaspora, groups, of, immigrants, can, more, easily, stay, in, contact, with, their, family, and, friends, in, their, origin, region, compared, to, earlier, eras, where, travel, and, communication, was, far, more, expensive, making, a, narrative, of, strictly, increasing, global, homogenization, incomplete, international, telephone, networks, and, later, internet, telephony, allowed, cheaper, and, easier, long, distance, communication, than, previous, eras, language, usage, in, the, contemporary, era, has, seen, a, rise, in, english, as, a, lingua, franca, where, people, across, the, world, learn, the, english, language, as, a, second, language, this, has, been, both, to, facilitate, international, communication, especially, in, places, tied, to, international, trade, or, tourism, as, well, as, to, better, consume, widespread, english, language, media, this, is, tied, to, increased, americanization, as, american, culture, has, grown, increasingly, influential, and, widespread, to, a, lesser, extent, during, the, cold, war, something, similar, happened, with, the, russian, language, in, the, eastern, bloc, and, among, communist, aligned, factions, however, this, status, was, mostly, reversed, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, the, french, and, german, languages, saw, their, prestige, as, global, languages, decline, after, world, war, ii, religious, trends, have, been, disparate, and, not, consistent, across, countries, often, with, sharply, varying, results, even, between, similar, and, nearby, groups, in, industrialized, and, economically, prosperous, regions, there, has, been, a, loose, trend, toward, secularization, that, deprioritized, the, role, of, religion, even, among, people, who, still, identified, as, adherents, the, decline, of, christianity, in, the, western, world, has, been, perhaps, the, most, notable, of, these, trends, although, many, non, western, cultures, have, been, affected, as, well, such, as, the, rise, of, irreligion, in, china, buttressed, by, antireligious, campaigns, as, an, example, of, how, localized, this, process, can, be, during, the, cold, war, both, the, polish, people, s, republic, and, the, czechoslovak, socialist, republic, endorsed, state, atheism, however, after, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, in, 1989, 1990, the, people, of, these, bordering, states, had, radically, different, cultural, attitudes, toward, religion, poland, was, one, of, the, more, religious, states, in, europe, with, 96, of, its, population, espousing, a, belief, in, catholic, christianity, in, 2011, while, the, czech, republic, was, one, of, the, most, stridently, irreligious, with, only, 15, of, its, population, espousing, any, religious, beliefs, at, all, by, 2011, in, the, islamic, world, a, notable, trend, has, been, the, spread, of, international, schools, of, thought, into, regions, where, belief, was, previously, localized, such, as, the, international, propagation, of, salafism, and, wahhabism, funded, by, the, government, of, saudi, arabia, while, regional, islamic, groups, remain, strong, they, are, more, contested, than, in, the, past, another, social, trend, has, been, the, rise, of, urbanization, as, a, larger, proportion, of, the, world, s, population, has, moved, to, live, in, cities, and, urban, areas, and, fewer, people, live, in, rural, areas, in, the, united, states, as, the, overall, population, more, than, doubled, from, 1930, to, 1990, around, a, third, of, its, counties, saw, their, population, decline, by, around, 27, suggesting, that, as, rural, counties, empty, the, urban, counties, are, where, the, vast, majority, of, inhabitants, are, moving, to, in, eastern, africa, the, urban, population, soared, from, 11, million, in, 1920, to, 77, million, in, 2010, many, rural, chinese, people, moved, to, large, coastal, cities, such, as, shenzhen, to, work, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, leading, to, a, sharp, increase, of, urbanization, in, china, rural, parts, of, japan, have, seen, stark, population, declines, especially, among, the, young, with, only, the, greater, tokyo, area, continuing, to, grow, how, to, deal, with, this, change, is, a, major, issue, as, many, cities, and, their, transportation, networks, were, not, designed, to, serve, the, larger, populations, that, now, occupy, them, a, major, trend, in, many, industrialized, nations, was, the, sexual, revolution, an, adoption, of, publicly, more, tolerant, attitudes, toward, sex, and, pre, marital, sex, the, pill, was, first, approved, for, use, in, 1960, in, the, united, states, and, spread, rapidly, around, the, world, the, pill, made, birth, control, easier, and, more, reliable, than, earlier, methods, this, made, sex, for, pleasure, less, likely, to, result, in, unintended, children, it, also, allowed, for, easier, family, planning, where, couples, could, choose, more, specifically, when, to, have, kids, compared, to, earlier, eras, some, analysts, credit, this, as, one, reason, behind, a, decline, in, birth, rates, in, the, industrialized, world, which, had, multiple, second, order, effects, many, regions, have, also, made, divorce, much, easier, to, officially, procure, however, the, decline, in, birth, rate, is, not, a, universal, trend, many, nations, continue, to, have, high, birth, rates, and, the, world, s, overall, population, is, still, growing, as, of, 2022, one, of, the, yet, evolving, and, unknown, impacts, in, the, contemporary, era, has, been, the, social, effects, of, cheap, and, common, internet, access, as, users, gradually, switched, from, personal, web, pages, to, blogs, to, social, media, many, surprising, effects, have, resulted, with, both, positive, and, negative, assessments, optimistic, assessments, often, praise, the, decentralized, nature, that, allows, anyone, to, theoretically, gain, a, platform, without, the, need, to, convince, a, publisher, or, media, company, to, back, them, as, well, as, the, ease, in, enabling, like, minded, people, to, collaborate, at, long, distance, even, if, the, digital, utopianism, of, the, 1990s, is, less, common, pessimistic, assessments, worry, about, the, effects, on, children, such, as, enabling, cyberbullying, filter, bubbles, where, internet, users, are, not, challenged, by, outsider, views, cancel, culture, where, people, are, pilloried, online, but, sometimes, disproportionately, and, slacktivism, as, an, appealing, but, ineffective, replacement, for, older, forms, of, community, work, the, growing, world, population, and, rising, standards, of, living, has, caused, a, vast, increase, in, demand, for, energy, development, both, to, power, vehicles, such, as, personal, cars, as, well, as, on, public, electrical, grids, in, particular, petroleum, oil, has, been, in, ravenous, demand, across, the, world, many, of, the, cheapest, and, easiest, sources, of, oil, to, access, were, largely, drained, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, leading, to, a, hunt, for, new, sources, of, oil, the, value, of, oil, has, spilled, over, into, politics, as, well, as, petrostates, with, access, to, oil, found, a, source, of, vast, revenue, that, did, not, require, traditional, government, revenue, raising, measures, such, as, tariffs, or, income, taxation, the, rising, cost, of, oil, led, to, the, 1970s, energy, crisis, and, various, adaptations, in, energy, conservation, to, better, conserve, oil, such, as, more, efficient, engines, and, better, insulation, it, has, also, led, to, concerns, of, peak, oil, that, the, rising, extraction, costs, of, oil, will, eventually, lead, to, massive, shortages, and, a, large, disincentive, to, burn, oil, except, when, absolutely, necessary, such, as, in, the, case, of, aviation, fuel, although, oil, continues, to, be, one, of, the, most, popular, sources, of, energy, other, fossil, fuels, have, continued, a, prominent, role, in, the, world, s, energy, production, coal, energy, usually, credited, as, helping, kickstart, the, industrial, revolution, has, declined, somewhat, in, prominence, but, it, started, from, a, commanding, large, slice, of, the, sources, of, energy, even, if, diminished, coal, is, still, a, popular, and, common, style, of, power, plant, it, made, up, a, huge, proportion, of, south, africa, and, india, s, power, grid, from, 1945, to, the, present, for, example, that, said, increasing, price, as, well, as, concerns, both, over, the, air, pollution, generated, when, it, is, burnt, and, the, landscape, destruction, when, it, is, mined, such, as, mountaintop, removal, mining, have, caused, setbacks, for, the, coal, industry, natural, gas, has, grown, in, its, proportion, of, the, market, especially, as, liquefied, natural, gas, lng, has, enabled, it, to, be, transported, over, longer, distances, than, was, previously, feasible, an, entirely, new, form, of, energy, creation, dawned, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, nuclear, power, for, peaceful, purposes, and, the, construction, of, nuclear, power, plants, hopes, that, atomic, energy, would, be, too, cheap, to, meter, in, the, 1950s, proved, overly, optimistic, however, atomic, energy, grew, to, be, a, large, part, of, several, nations, energy, generation, strategies, especially, nuclear, power, in, france, nuclear, power, continues, to, be, controversial, concerns, include, its, association, with, nuclear, weapons, financial, cost, disposal, of, radioactive, nuclear, waste, and, fears, of, safety, from, reactor, meltdowns, especially, after, the, 1986, chernobyl, disaster, an, anti, nuclear, movement, arose, that, was, skeptical, of, atomic, energy, and, has, discouraged, many, projects, nuclear, proponents, counter, that, nuclear, energy, produces, no, air, pollution, compared, to, traditional, fossil, fuel, plants, and, can, provide, a, steady, supply, of, energy, regardless, of, external, conditions, unlike, solar, and, wind, energy, with, the, supply, of, russian, natural, gas, disrupted, in, 2022, france, is, looking, to, reactivate, some, of, its, older, decommissioned, nuclear, plants, for, example, various, forms, of, renewable, energy, have, grown, in, prominence, in, the, contemporary, era, wind, energy, while, used, on, a, small, scale, for, centuries, has, seen, growth, with, large, distributed, groups, of, windmills, used, to, produce, energy, for, the, grid, solar, power, has, also, grown, in, prominence, with, around, 4, of, the, world, s, overall, energy, production, in, 2021, compared, to, a, much, smaller, slice, before, while, these, energy, sources, are, considered, to, be, much, less, environmentally, impactful, than, fossil, fuels, concerns, have, been, raised, over, the, various, rare, earth, metals, used, in, the, production, of, batteries, and, solar, which, can, require, destructive, mining, techniques, to, gather, the, information, age, or, information, era, also, commonly, known, as, the, age, of, the, computer, is, an, idea, that, the, current, age,

find, previously, the, idea, is, heavily, linked, to, the, concept, of, a, digital, age, or, digital, revolution, and, carries, the, ramifications, of, a, shift, from, traditional, industry, that, the, industrial, revolution, brought, through, industrialization, to, an, economy, based, around, the, manipulation, of, information, the, period, is, generally, said, to, have, begun, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, though, the, particular, date, varies, the, term, began, its, use, around, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, and, has, been, used, up, to, the, present, with, the, availability, of, the, internet, during, the, late, 1990s, both, internet, directories, and, search, engines, were, popular, yahoo, and, altavista, both, founded, 1995, were, the, respective, industry, leaders, by, late, 2001, the, directory, model, had, begun, to, give, way, to, search, engines, tracking, the, rise, of, google, founded, 1998, which, had, developed, new, approaches, to, relevancy, ranking, directory, features, while, still, commonly, available, became, after, thoughts, to, search, engines, database, size, which, had, been, a, significant, marketing, feature, through, the, early, 2000s, decade, was, similarly, displaced, by, emphasis, on, relevancy, ranking, the, methods, by, which, search, engines, attempt, to, sort, the, best, results, first, web, 2, 0, is, characterized, as, facilitating, communication, information, sharing, interoperability, user, centered, design, and, collaboration, on, the, world, wide, web, it, has, led, to, the, development, and, evolution, of, web, based, communities, hosted, services, and, web, applications, examples, include, social, networking, sites, video, sharing, sites, wikis, blogs, mashups, and, folksonomies, social, networking, emerged, in, the, early, 21st, century, as, a, popular, social, communication, largely, replacing, much, of, the, function, of, email, message, boards, and, instant, messaging, services, twitter, facebook, and, youtube, are, all, major, examples, of, social, websites, that, gained, widespread, popularity, the, information, distribution, continued, into, the, early, 21st, century, with, mobile, interaction, and, internet, access, growing, massively, in, the, early, 21st, century, by, the, 2010s, a, majority, of, people, in, the, developed, world, had, internet, access, and, a, majority, of, people, worldwide, had, a, mobile, phone, marking, the, rise, of, mobile, computing, worldwide, sales, of, personal, computers, fall, 14, during, the, first, quarter, of, 2013, the,

laboratory, curiosity, the, most, elaborate, martian, exploration, vehicle, to, date, landed, on, mars, after, the, wmap, observations, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, information, was, released, in, 2011, of, the, work, done, by, the, planck, surveyor, estimating, the, age, of, the, universe, to, 13, 8, billion, years, old, a, 100, million, years, older, than, previously, thought, another, technological, advancement, came, in, 2012, with, european, physicists, statistically, demonstrating, the, existence, of, the, higgs, boson, climate, change, and, global, warming, reflects, the, notion, of, the, modern, climate, the, changes, of, climate, over, the, past, century, have, been, attributed, to, various, factors, which, have, resulted, in, a, global, warming, this, warming, is, the, increase, in, the, average, temperature, of, the, earth, s, near, surface, air, and, oceans, since, the, mid, 20th, century, and, its, projected, continuation, some, effects, on, both, the, natural, environment, and, human, life, are, at, least, in, part, already, being, attributed, to, global, warming, a, 2001, report, by, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, suggests, that, glacier, retreat, ice, shelf, disruption, such, as, that, of, the, larsen, ice, shelf, sea, level, rise, changes, in, rainfall, patterns, and, increased, intensity, and, frequency, of, extreme, weather, events, are, attributable, in, part, to, global, warming, other, expected, effects, include, water, scarcity, in, some, regions, and, increased, precipitation, in, others, changes, in, mountain, snowpack, and, adverse, health, effects, from, warmer, temperatures, it, is, usually, impossible, to, connect, specific, weather, events, to, human, impact, on, the, world, instead, such, impact, is, expected, to, cause, changes, in, the, overall, distribution, and, intensity, of, weather, events, such, as, changes, to, the, frequency, and, intensity, of, heavy, precipitation, broader, effects, are, expected, to, include, glacial, retreat, arctic, shrinkage, and, worldwide, sea, level, rise, other, effects, may, include, changes, in, crop, yields, addition, of, new, trade, routes, species, extinctions, and, changes, in, the, range, of, disease, vectors, until, 2009, the, arctic, northwest, passage, pack, ice, prevented, regular, marine, shipping, throughout, most, of, the, year, in, this, area, but, climate, change, has, reduced, the, pack, ice, and, this, arctic, shrinkage, made, the, waterways, more, navigable, several, disease, outbreaks, epidemics, and, pandemics, have, occurred, during, contemporary, history, some, of, these, include, the, 1957, 1958, influenza, pandemic, the, hong, kong, flu, of, 1968, 1969, the, 1977, 1979, russian, flu, the, hiv, aids, epidemic, 1981, present, the, sars, outbreak, of, 2002, 2004, the, swine, flu, pandemic, of, 2009, 2010, and, the, covid, 19, pandemic, 2019, 2022, in, 2020, an, outbreak, of, the, covid, 19, disease, first, documented, in, late, 2019, in, wuhan, china, spread, to, other, countries, becoming, a, global, pandemic, which, caused, a, major, socio, economic, disruption, all, over, the, world, many, countries, ordered, mandatory, lockdowns, on, movement, and, closures, of, non, essential, businesses, the, threat, of, the, disease, caused, the, covid, 19, recession, although, the, distribution, of, vaccines, has, since, eased, the, economic, impact, in, many, countries, more, generally, covid, 19, has, been, held, up, as, an, example, of, a, global, catastrophic, risk, unique, to, the, modern, era, s, ease, of, travel, new, diseases, can, spread, far, faster, and, further, in, the, contemporary, era, than, any, previous, era, of, human, history, pandemic, prevention, is, one, resulting, field, to, ensure, that, if, this, happens, with, a, sufficiently, deadly, virus, humanity, can, take, measures, to, stop, its, spread, general, generations, music, and, arts, future
