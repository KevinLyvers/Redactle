a, village, on, the, spur, of, mount, silpius, named, io, or, iopolis, this, name, was, always, adduced, as, evidence, by, antiochenes, e, g, libanius, eager, to, affiliate, themselves, to, the,

intended, to, enhance, antioch, s, status, but, the, story, is, not, unlikely, in, itself, after, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, his, generals, the, diadochi, divided, up, the, territory, he, had, conquered, after, the, battle, of, ipsos, in, 301, bc, seleucus, i, nicator, won, the, territory, of, syria, and, he, proceeded, to, found, four, sister, cities, in, northwestern, syria, one, of, which, was, antioch, a, city, named, in, honor, of, his, father, antiochus, according, to, the, suda, it, might, be, named, after, his, son, antiochus, he, is, reputed, to, have, built, sixteen, antiochs, seleucus, founded, antioch, on, a, site, chosen, through, ritual, means, an, eagle, the, bird, of, zeus, had, been, given, a, piece, of, sacrificial, meat, and, the, city, was, founded, on, the, site, to, which, the, eagle, carried, the, offering, seleucus, did, this, on, the, 22nd, day, of, the, month, of, artem, sios, in, the, twelfth, year, of, his, reign, equivalent, to, may, 300, bc, antioch, soon, rose, above, seleucia, pieria, to, become, the, syrian, capital, the, original, city, of, seleucus, was, laid, out, in, imitation, of, the, grid, plan, of, alexandria, by, the, architect, xenarius, libanius, describes, the, first, building, and, arrangement, of, this, city, i, p, 300, 17, the, citadel, was, on, mount, silpius, and, the, city, lay, mainly, on, the, low, ground, to, the, north, fringing, the, river, two, great, colonnaded, streets, intersected, in, the, centre, shortly, afterwards, a, second, quarter, was, laid, out, probably, on, the, east, and, by, antiochus, i, soter, which, from, an, expression, of, strabo, appears, to, have, been, the, native, as, contrasted, with, the, greek, town, it, was, enclosed, by, a, wall, of, its, own, in, the, orontes, north, of, the, city, lay, a, large, island, and, on, this, seleucus, ii, callinicus, began, a, third, walled, city, which, was, finished, by, antiochus, iii, the, great, a, fourth, and, last, quarter, was, added, by, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, 175, 164, bc, thenceforth, antioch, was, known, as, tetrapolis, from, west, to, east, the, whole, was, about, 6, kilometres, 4, miles, in, diameter, and, a, little, less, from, north, to, south, this, area, included, many, large, gardens, the, new, city, was, populated, by, a, mix, of, local, settlers, that, athenians, brought, from, the, nearby, city, of, antigonia, macedonians, and, jews, who, were, given, full, status, from, the, beginning, according, to, ancient, tradition, antioch, was, settled, by, 5, 500, athenians, and, macedonians, together, with, an, unknown, number, of, native, syrians, this, number, probably, refers, to, free, adult, citizens, so, that, the, total, number, of, free, greek, settlers, including, women, and, children, was, probably, between, 17, 000, and, 25, 000, about, 6, kilometres, 4, miles, west, and, beyond, the, suburb, heraclea, lay, the, paradise, of, daphne, a, park, of, woods, and, waters, in, the, midst, of, which, rose, a, great, temple, to, the, pythian, apollo, also, founded, by, seleucus, i, and, enriched, with, a, cult, statue, of, the, god, as, musagetes, by, bryaxis, a, companion, sanctuary, of, hecate, was, constructed, underground, by, diocletian, the, beauty, and, the, lax, morals, of, daphne, were, celebrated, all, over, the, ancient, world, and, indeed, antioch, as, a, whole, shared, in, both, these, titles, to, fame, antioch, became, the, capital, and, court, city, of, the, western, seleucid, empire, under, antiochus, i, its, counterpart, in, the, east, being, seleucia, but, its, paramount, importance, dates, from, the, battle, of, ancyra, 240, bc, which, shifted, the, seleucid, centre, of, gravity, from, anatolia, and, led, indirectly, to, the, rise, of, pergamon, the, seleucids, reigned, from, antioch, we, know, little, of, it, in, the, hellenistic, period, apart, from, syria, all, our, information, coming, from, authors, of, the, late, roman, time, among, its, great, greek, buildings, we, hear, only, of, the, theatre, of, which, substructures, still, remain, on, the, flank, of, silpius, and, of, the, royal, palace, probably, situated, on, the, island, it, enjoyed, a, reputation, for, being, a, populous, city, full, of, most, erudite, men, and, rich, in, the, most, liberal, studies, but, the, only, names, of, distinction, in, these, pursuits, during, the, seleucid, period, that, have, come, down, to, us, are, apollophanes, the, stoic, and, one, phoebus, a, writer, on, dreams, the, nicknames, which, they, gave, to, their, later, kings, were, aramaic, and, except, apollo, and, daphne, the, great, divinities, of, north, syria, seem, to, have, remained, essentially, native, such, as, the, persian, artemis, of, meroe, and, atargatis, of, hierapolis, bambyce, the, epithet, golden, suggests, that, the, external, appearance, of, antioch, was, impressive, but, the, city, needed, constant, restoration, owing, to, the, seismic, disturbances, to, which, the, district, has, always, been, subjected, the, first, great, earthquake, in, recorded, history, was, related, by, the, native, chronicler, john, malalas, it, occurred, in, 148, bc, and, did, immense, damage, local, politics, were, turbulent, in, the, many, dissensions, of, the, seleucid, house, the, population, took, sides, and, frequently, rose, in, rebellion, for, example, against, alexander, balas, in, 147, bc, and, demetrius, ii, nicator, in, 129, bc, the, latter, enlisting, a, body, of, jews, punished, his, capital, with, fire, and, sword, in, the, last, struggles, of, the, seleucid, house, antioch, turned, against, its, feeble, rulers, invited, tigranes, the, great, to, occupy, the, city, in, 83, bc, tried, to, unseat, antiochus, xiii, asiaticus, in, 65, bc, and, petitioned, rome, against, his, restoration, in, the, following, year, antioch, s, wish, prevailed, and, it, passed, with, syria, to, the, roman, republic, in, 64, bc, but, remained, a, civitas, libera, the, roman, emperors, favored, the, city, from, the, first, moments, seeing, it, as, a, more, suitable, capital, for, the, eastern, part, of, the, empire, than, alexandria, could, be, because, of, the, isolated, position, of, egypt, to, a, certain, extent, they, tried, to, make, it, an, eastern, rome, julius, caesar, visited, it, in, 47, bc, and, confirmed, its, freedom, a, great, temple, to, jupiter, capitolinus, rose, on, silpius, probably, at, the, insistence, of, octavian, whose, cause, the, city, had, espoused, a, forum, of, roman, type, was, laid,

much, smaller, than, seleucia, and, alexandria, alexandria, had, been, said, by, diodorus, siculus, in, the, mid, first, century, bc, to, have, 300, 000, free, inhabitants, which, would, mean, that, antioch, was, about, this, size, in, strabo, s, time, agrippa, and, tiberius, enlarged, the, theatre, and, trajan, finished, their, work, antoninus, pius, paved, the, great, east, to, west, artery, with, granite, a, circus, other, colonnades, and, great, numbers, of, baths, were, built, and, new, aqueducts, to, supply, them, bore, the, names, of, caesars, the, finest, being, the, work, of,

growth, of, a, new, suburb, south, of, this, one, of, the, most, famous, roman, additions, to, the, city, was, its, hippodrome, the, circus, of, antioch, this, chariot, racing, venue, was, probably, built, in, the, reign, of, augustus, when, the, city, had, more, than, half, a, million, inhabitants, it, was, modelled, on, the, circus, maximus, in, rome, and, other, circus, buildings, throughout, the, empire, measuring, more, than, 490, metres, 1, 610, feet, in, length, and, 30, metres, 98, feet, of, width, the, circus, could, house, up, to, 80, 000, spectators, zarmanochegas, zarmarus, a,

germanicus, died, in, 19, ad, and, his, body, was, burnt, in, the, forum, an, earthquake, that, shook, antioch, in, ad, 37, caused, the, emperor, caligula, to, send, two, senators, to, report, on, the, condition, of, the, city, another, quake, followed, in, the, next, reign, in, 115, ad, during, trajan, s, travel, there, during, his, war, against, parthia, the, whole, site, was, convulsed, by, a, huge, earthquake, the, landscape, altered, and, the, emperor, himself, was, forced, to, take, shelter, in, the, circus, for, several, days, he, and, his, successor, restored, the, city, but, the, population, was, reduced, to, less, than, 400, 000, inhabitants, and, many, sections, of, the, city, were, abandoned, commodus, r, 177, 192, ad, had, olympic, games, celebrated, at, antioch, in, 256, ad, the, town, was, suddenly, raided, by, the, persians, under, shapur, i, and, many, of, the, people, were, slain, in, the, theatre, it, was, recaptured, by, the, roman, emperor, valerian, the, following, year, antioch, was, a, chief, center, of, early, christianity, during, roman, times, the, city, had, a, large, population, of, jewish, origin, in, a, quarter, called, the, kerateion, and, so, attracted, the, earliest, missionaries, evangelized, by, among, others, peter, himself, according, to, the, tradition, upon, which, the, patriarchate, of, antioch, still, rests, its, claim, for, primacy, its, converts, were, the, first, to, be, called, christians, this, is, not, to, be, confused, with, antioch, in, pisidia, to, which, barnabas, and, paul, of, tarsus, later, travelled, between, 252, and, 300, ad, ten, assemblies, of, the, church, were, held, at, antioch, and, it, became, the, seat, of, one, of, the, five, original, patriarchates, along, with, constantinople,

church, three, eastern, catholic, the, maronite, syriac, catholic, and, melkite, greek, catholic, churches, and, one, eastern, orthodox, the, greek, orthodox, church, of, antioch, this, title, has, been, maintained, though, most, of, them, have, moved, their, seat, to, damascus, this, is, somewhat, analogous, to, the, manner, in, which, several, popes, heads, of, the, roman, catholic, church, remained, bishop, of, rome, even, while, residing, in, avignon, in, present, day, france, in, the, fourteenth, century, the, maronite, church, which, has, also, moved, the, seat, away, to, bkerk,

313, begun, the, building, of, the, domus, aurea, or, great, church, in, 327, which, served, for, the, next, two, centuries, as, the, leading, church, of, antioch, john, chrysostom, writes, that, when, ignatius, of, antioch, was, bishop, in, the, city, the, d, mos, probably, meaning, the, number, of, free, adult, men, and, women, without, counting, children, and, slaves, numbered, 200, 000, in, a, letter, written, in, 363, libanius, says, the, city, contains, 150, 000, anthr, poi, plural, of, anthropos, human, a, word, which, would, ordinarily, mean, all, human, beings, of, any, age, sex, or, social, status, seemingly, indicating, a, decline, in, the, population, since, the, first, century, chrysostom, also, says, in, one, of, his, homilies, on, the, gospel, of, matthew, which, were, delivered, between, 386, and, 393, that, in, his, own, time, there, were, 100, 000, christians, in, antioch, a, figure, which, may, refer, to, orthodox, christians, who, belonged, to, the, great, church, as, opposed, to, members, of, other, groups, such, as, arians, and, apollinarians, or, to, all, christians, of, any, persuasion, when, the, emperor, julian, visited, in, 362, on, a, detour, to, the, sasanian, empire, he, had, high, hopes, for, antioch, regarding, it, as, a, rival, to, the, imperial, capital, of, constantinople, antioch, had, a, mixed, pagan, and, christian, population, which, ammianus, marcellinus, implies, lived, quite, harmoniously, together, however, julian, s, visit, began, ominously, as, it, coincided, with, a, lament, for, adonis, the, doomed, lover, of, aphrodite, thus, ammianus, wrote, the, emperor, and, his, soldiers, entered, the, city, not, to, the, sound, of, cheers, but, to, wailing, and, screaming, after, being, advised, that, the, bones, of, third, century, martyred, bishop, babylas, were, suppressing, the, oracle, of, apollo, at, daphne, he, made, a, public, relations, mistake, in, ordering, the, removal, of, the, bones, from, the, vicinity, of, the, temple, the, result, was, a, massive, christian, procession, shortly, after, that, when, the, temple, was, destroyed, by, fire, julian, suspected, the, christians, and, ordered, stricter, investigations, than, usual, he, also, shut, up, constantine, s, great, church, before, the, investigations, proved, that, the, fire, was, the, result, of, an, accident, julian, found, much, else, about, which, to, criticize, the, antiochene, julian, had, wanted, the, empire, s, cities, to, be, more, self, managing, as, they, had, been, some, 200, years, before, however, antioch, s, city, councilmen, showed, themselves, unwilling, to, shore, up, antioch, s, food, shortage, with, their, own, resources, so, dependent, were, they, on, the, emperor, ammianus, wrote, that, the, councilmen, shirked, their, duties, by, bribing, unwitting, men, in, the, marketplace, to, do, the, job, for, them, further, julian, was, surprised, and, dismayed, when, at, the, city, s, annual, feast, of, apollo, the, only, antiochene, present, was, an, old, priest, clutching, a, goose, showing, the, decay, of, paganism, in, the, town, the, antiochenes, in, turn, hated, julian, for, worsening, the, food, shortage, with, the, burden, of, his, billeted, troops, wrote, ammianus, the, soldiers, were, often, to, be, found, gorged, on, sacrificial, meat, making, a, drunken, nuisance, of, themselves, on, the, streets, while, antioch, s, hungry, citizens, looked, on, in, disgust, the, christian, antiochenes, and, julian, s, pagan, gallic, soldiers, also, never, quite, saw, eye, to, eye, julian, s, piety, was, distasteful, to, the, antiochenes, even, to, those, who, kept, the, old, religion, julian, s, brand, of, paganism, was, very, much, unique, to, himself, with, little, support, outside, the, most, educated, neoplatonist, circles, the, irony, of, julian, s, enthusiasm, for, large, scale, animal, sacrifice, could, not, have, escaped, the, hungry, antiochenes, julian, gained, no, admiration, for, his, personal, involvement, in, the, sacrifices, only, the, nickname, axeman, wrote, ammianus, the, emperor, s, high, handed, severe, methods, and, his, rigid, administration, prompted, antiochene, lampoons, about, among, other, things, julian, s, unfashionably, pointed, beard, julian, s, successor, valens, endowed, antioch, with, a, new, forum, including, a, statue, of, his, brother, and, co, emperor, valentinian, i, on, a, central, column, and, reopened, the, great, church, of, constantine, which, stood, until, the, persian, sack, in, 538, by, chosroes, in, 387, ad, there, was, a, great, sedition, caused, by, a, new, tax, levied, by, order, of, theodosius, i, and, the, city, was, punished, by, the, loss, of, its, metropolitan, status, theodosius, placed, antioch, under, constantinople, s, rule, when, he, divided, the, roman, empire, antioch, and, its, port, seleucia, pieria, were, severely, damaged, by, the, great, earthquake, of, 526, seleucia, pieria, which, was, already, fighting, a, losing, battle, against, continual, silting, never, recovered, a, second, earthquake, affected, antioch, in, 528, justinian, i, renamed, antioch, theopolis, city, of, god, and, restored, many, of, its, public, buildings, but, the, destructive, work, was, completed, in, 540, by, the, persian, king, khosrau, i, who, deported, the, population, to, a, newly, built, city, in, persian, mesopotamia, weh, antiok, khosrow, antioch, lost, as, many, as, 300, 000, people, justinian, i, made, an, effort, to, revive, it, and, procopius, describes, his, repairing, of, the, walls, but, its, glory, was, past, another, earthquake, in, 588, destroyed, the, domus, aureus, of, constantine, whereafter, the, church, of, cassian, became, the, most, important, church, of, antioch, during, the, byzantine, sasanian, war, of, 602, 628, the, emperor, heraclius, confronted, the, invading, persian, army, of, khosrow, ii, outside, antioch, in, 613, the, byzantines, were, defeated, by, forces, under, the, generals, shahrbaraz, and, shahin, vahmanzadegan, at, the, battle, of, antioch, after, which, the, city, fell, to, the, sassanians, together, with, much, of, syria, and, eastern, anatolia, antioch, gave, its, name, to, a, certain, school, of, christian, thought, distinguished, by, literal, interpretation, of, the, scriptures, and, insistence, on, the, human, limitations, of, jesus, diodorus, of, tarsus, and, theodore, of, mopsuestia, were, the, leaders, of, this, school, the, principal, local, saint, was, simeon, stylites, who, lived, an, extremely, ascetic, life, atop, a, pillar, for, 40, years, some, 65, kilometres, 40, miles, east, of, antioch, his, body, was, brought, to, the, city, and, buried, in, a, building, erected, under, the, emperor, leo, during, the, byzantine, era, great, bathhouses, were, built, in, byzantine, centers, such, as, constantinople, and, antioch, in, 637, during, the, reign, of, the, byzantine, emperor, heraclius, antioch, was, conquered, by, abu, ubayda, ibn, al, jarrah, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, during, the, battle, of, the, iron, bridge, marking, the, beginning, of, islamic, influence, in, the, region, the, city, became, known, in, arabic, as, an, kiyah, under, the, umayyad, caliphate, 661, 750, ad, antioch, served, as, a, significant, military, and, administrative, center, the, umayyads, fortified, the, city, utilizing, it, as, a, base, for, operations, in, the, region, the, city, remained, an, important, urban, center, with, its, multicultural, population, including, christians, muslims, and, jews, living, together, although, there, were, periods, of, tension, and, conflict, however, since, the, umayyad, dynasty, was, unable, to, penetrate, the, anatolian, plateau, antioch, found, itself, on, the, frontline, of, the, conflicts, between, two, hostile, empires, during, the, next, 350, years, so, that, the, city, went, into, a, precipitous,
