the, west, central, part, of, anatolia, in, what, is, now, asian, turkey, centered, on, the, sangarios, river, after, its, conquest, it, became, a, region, of, the, great, empires, of, the, time, stories, of, the, heroic, age, of, greek, mythology, tell, of, several, legendary, phrygian, kings, according, to, homer, s, iliad, the, phrygians, participated, in, the, trojan, war, as, close, allies, of, the, trojans, fighting, against, the, achaeans, phrygian, power, reached, its, peak, in, the, late, 8th, century, bc, under, another, historical, king, midas, who, dominated, most, of, western, and, central, anatolia, and, rivaled, assyria, and, urartu, for, power, in, eastern, anatolia, this, later, midas, was, however, also, the, last, independent, king, of, phrygia, before, cimmerians, sacked, the, phrygian, capital, gordium, around, 695, bc, phrygia, then, became, subject, to, lydia, and, then, successively, to, persia, alexander, and, his, hellenistic, successors, pergamon, the, roman, empire, and, the, byzantine, empire, over, this, time, phrygians, became, christian, and, greek, speaking, assimilating, into, the, byzantine, state, after, the, turkish, conquest, of, byzantine, anatolia, in, the, late, middle, ages, the, name, phrygia, passed, out, of, usage, as, a, territorial, designation, phrygia, describes, an, area, on, the, western, end, of, the, high, anatolian, plateau, an, arid, region, quite, unlike, the, forested, lands, to, the, north, and, west, of, it, phrygia, begins, in, the, northwest, where, an, area, of, dry, steppe, is, diluted, by, the, sakarya, and, porsuk, river, system, and, is, home, to, the, settlements, of, dorylaeum, near, modern, eski, ehir, and, the, phrygian, capital, gordion, the, climate, is, harsh, with, hot, summers, and, cold, winters, therefore, olives, will, not, easily, grow, here, so, the, land, is, mostly, used, for, livestock, grazing, and, barley, production, south, of, dorylaeum, an, important, phrygian, settlement, midas, city, yaz, l, kaya, eski, ehir, is, situated, in, an, area, of, hills, and, columns, of, volcanic, tuff, to, the, south, again, central, phrygia, includes, the, cities, of, afyonkarahisar, ancient, akroinon, with, its, marble, quarries, at, nearby, docimium, scehisar, and, the, town, of, synnada, at, the, western, end, of, phrygia, stood, the, towns, of, aizanoi, modern, avdarhisar, and, acmonia, from, here, to, the, southwest, lies, the, hilly, area, of, phrygia, that, contrasts, to, the, bare, plains, of, the, region, s, heartland, the, region, of, southwestern, phrygia, is, irrigated, by, the, maeander, also, known, as, the, b, y, k, menderes, river, along, with, its, tributary, the, lycus, within, its, boundaries, lie, the, towns, of, laodicea, on, the, lycus, and, hierapolis, according, to, ancient, tradition, among, greek, historians, the, phrygians, migrated, to, anatolia, from, the, balkans, herodotus, says, that, the, phrygians, were, called, bryges, when, they, lived, in, europe, he, and, other, greek, writers, also, recorded, legends, about, king, midas, that, associated, him, with, or, put, his, origin, in, macedonia, herodotus, for, example, says, a, wild, rose, garden, in, macedonia, was, named, after, midas, some, classical, writers, also, connected, the, phrygians, with, the, mygdones, the, name, of, two, groups, of, people, one, of, which, lived, in, northern, macedonia, and, another, in, mysia, likewise, the, phrygians, have, been, identified, with, the, bebryces, a, people, said, to, have, warred, with, mysia, before, the, trojan, war, and, who, had, a, king, named, mygdon, at, roughly, the, same, time, as, the, phrygians, were, said, to, have, had, a, king, named, mygdon, the, classical, historian, strabo, groups, phrygians, mygdones, mysians, bebryces, and, bithynians, together, as, peoples, that, migrated, to, anatolia, from, the, balkans, this, image, of, phrygians, as, part, of, a, related, group, of, northwest, anatolian, cultures, seems, the, most, likely, explanation, for, the, confusion, over, whether, phrygians, bebryces, and, anatolian, mygdones, were, or, were, not, the, same, people, phrygian, continued, to, be, spoken, until, the, 6th, century, ad, though, its, distinctive, alphabet, was, lost, earlier, than, those, of, most, anatolian, cultures, one, of, the, homeric, hymns, describes, the, phrygian, language, as, not, mutually, intelligible, with, that, of, troy, and, inscriptions, found, at, gordium, make, clear, that, phrygians, spoke, an, indo, european, language, with, at, least, some, vocabulary, similar, to, greek, phrygian, clearly, did, not, belong, to, the, family, of, anatolian, languages, spoken, in, most, of, the, adjacent, countries, such, as, hittite, the, apparent, similarity, of, the, phrygian, language, to, greek, and, its, dissimilarity, with, the, anatolian, languages, spoken, by, most, of, their, neighbors, is, also, taken, as, support, for, a, european, origin, of, the, phrygians, from, what, is, available, it, is, evident, that, phrygian, shares, important, features, with, greek, and, armenian, phrygian, is, part, of, the, centum, group, of, indo, european, languages, however, between, the, 19th, and, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, phrygian, was, mostly, considered, a, sat, m, language, and, thus, closer, to, armenian, and, thracian, while, today, it, is, commonly, considered, to, be, a, centum, language, and, thus, closer, to, greek, the, reason, that, in, the, past, phrygian, had, the, guise, of, a, sat, m, language, was, due, to, two, secondary, processes, that, affected, it, namely, phrygian, merged, the, old, labiovelar, with, the, plain, velar, and, secondly, when, in, contact, with, palatal, vowels, e, and, i, especially, in, initial, position, some, consonants, became, palatalized, furthermore, kortlandt, 1988, presented, common, sound, changes, of, thracian, and, armenian, and, their, separation, from, phrygian, and, the, rest, of, the, palaeo, balkan, languages, from, an, early, stage, modern, consensus, regards, greek, as, the, closest, relative, of, phrygian, a, position, that, is, supported, by, brixhe, neumann, matzinger, woodhouse, ligorio, lubotsky, and, obrador, cursach, furthermore, 34, out, of, the, 36, phrygian, isoglosses, that, are, recorded, are, shared, with, greek, with, 22, being, exclusive, between, them, the, last, 50, years, of, phrygian, scholarship, developed, a, hypothesis, that, proposes, a, proto, graeco, phrygian, stage, out, of, which, greek, and, phrygian, originated, and, if, phrygian, was, more, sufficiently, attested, that, stage, could, perhaps, be, reconstructed, some, scholars, dismiss, the, claim, of, a, phrygian, migration, as, a, mere, legend, likely, arising, from, the, coincidental, similarity, of, their, name, to, the, bryges, and, have, theorized, that, migration, into, phrygia, could, have, occurred, more, recently, than, classical, sources, suggest, they, have, sought, to, fit, the, phrygian, arrival, into, a, narrative, explaining, the, downfall, of, the, hittite, empire, and, the, end, of, the, high, bronze, age, in, anatolia, according, to, the, recent, migration, theory, the, phrygians, invaded, just, before, or, after, the, collapse, of, the, hittite, empire, at, the, beginning, of, the, 12th, century, bc, filling, the, political, vacuum, in, central, western, anatolia, and, may, have, been, counted, among, the, sea, peoples, that, egyptian, records, credit, with, bringing, about, the, hittite, collapse, the, so, called, handmade, knobbed, ware, found, in, western, anatolia, during, this, period, has, been, tentatively, identified, as, an, import, connected, to, this, invasion, some, scholars, believe, that, the, phrygians, were, already, established, on, the, sakarya, river, during, the, late, bronze, age, these, scholars, seek, instead, to, trace, the, phrygians, origins, among, the, many, nations, of, western, anatolia, who, were, subject, to, the, hittites, this, interpretation, finds, some, motivation, in, greek, legends, about, phrygians, participation, in, the, trojan, war, as, well, as, the, founding, myth, of, the, gordium, no, one, has, conclusively, identified, which, of, the, many, subjects, of, the, hittites, might, have, represented, early, phrygians, according, to, a, classical, tradition, popularized, by, josephus, phrygia, can, be, equated, with, the, country, called, togarmah, by, the, ancient, hebrews, which, has, in, turn, been, identified, as, the, tegarama, of, hittite, texts, and, til, garimmu, of, assyrian, records, josephus, called, togarmah, the, thrugrammeans, who, as, the, greeks, resolved, were, named, phrygians, however, the, greek, source, cited, by, josephus, is, unknown, and, it, is, unclear, if, there, was, any, basis, for, the, identification, other, than, name, similarity, scholars, of, the, hittites, believe, tegarama, was, in, eastern, anatolia, some, locate, it, at, gurun, far, to, the, east, of, phrygia, some, scholars, have, identified, phrygia, with, the, assuwa, league, and, noted, that, the, iliad, mentions, a, phrygian, queen, hecuba, s, brother, named, asios, another, possible, early, name, of, phrygia, could, be, hapalla, the, name, of, the, easternmost, province, that, emerged, from, the, splintering, of, the, bronze, age, western, anatolian, empire, arzawa, however, scholars, are, unsure, if, hapalla, corresponds, to, phrygia, or, to, pisidia, further, south, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, writing, circa, 440, bc, suggested, that, armenians, migrated, from, phrygia, which, at, the, time, encompassed, much, of, western, and, central, anatolia, the, armenians, were, equipped, like, phrygians, being, phrygian, colonists, 7, 73, according, to, herotodus, the, phrygians, had, originated, in, the, balkans, in, an, area, adjoining, macedonia, from, where, they, had, emigrated, to, anatolia, during, the, bronze, age, collapse, this, led, later, scholars, such, as, igor, diakonoff, to, theorize, that, armenians, also, originated, in, the, balkans, and, moved, east, with, the, phrygians, however, an, armenian, origin, in, the, balkans, although, once, widely, accepted, has, been, facing, increased, scrutiny, in, recent, years, due, to, discrepancies, in, the, timeline, and, lack, of, genetic, and, archeological, evidence, in, fact, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, phrygians, and, or, the, apparently, related, mushki, people, were, originally, from, armenia, and, moved, westward, a, number, of, linguists, have, rejected, a, close, relationship, between, armenian, and, phrygian, despite, saying, that, the, two, languages, do, share, some, features, phrygian, is, now, classified, as, a, centum, language, more, closely, related, to, greek, than, armenian, whereas, armenian, is, mostly, satem, during, the, 8th, century, bc, the, phrygian, kingdom, with, its, capital, at, gordium, in, the, upper, sakarya, river, valley, expanded, into, an, empire, dominating, most, of, central, and, western, anatolia, and, encroaching, upon, the, larger, assyrian, empire, to, its, southeast, and, the, kingdom, of, urartu, to, the, northeast, according, to, the, classical, historians, strabo, eusebius, and, julius, africanus, the, king, of, phrygia, during, this, time, was, another, midas, this, historical, midas, is, believed, to, be, the, same, person, named, as, mita, in, assyrian, texts, from, the, period, and, identified, as, king, of, the, mushki, scholars, figure, that, assyrians, called, phrygians, mushki, because, the, phrygians, and, mushki, an, eastern, anatolian, people, were, at, that, time, campaigning, in, a, joint, army, this, midas, is, thought, to, have, reigned, phrygia, at, the, peak, of, its, power, from, about, 720, bc, to, about, 695, bc, according, to, eusebius, or, 676, bc, according, to, julius, africanus, an, assyrian, inscription, mentioning, mita, dated, to, 709, bc, during, the, reign, of, sargon, of, assyria, suggests, phrygia, and, assyria, had, struck, a, truce, by, that, time, this, midas, appears, to, have, had, good, relations, and, close, trade, ties, with, the, greeks, and, reputedly, married, an, aeolian, greek, princess, a, system, of, writing, in, the, phrygian, language, developed, and, flourished, in, gordium, during, this, period, using, a, phoenician, derived, alphabet, similar, to, the, greek, one, a, distinctive, phrygian, pottery, called, polished, ware, appears, during, this, period, however, the, phrygian, kingdom, was, then, overwhelmed, by, cimmerian, invaders, and, gordium, was, sacked, and, destroyed, according, to, strabo, and, others, midas, committed, suicide, by, drinking, bulls, blood, a, series, of, digs, have, opened, gordium, as, one, of, turkey, s, most, revealing, archeological, sites, excavations, confirm, a, violent, destruction, of, gordium, around, 675, bc, a, tomb, from, the, period, popularly, identified, as, the, tomb, of, midas, revealed, a, wooden, structure, deeply, buried, under, a, vast, tumulus, containing, grave, goods, a, coffin, furniture, and, food, offerings, archaeological, museum, ankara, after, their, destruction, of, gordium, the, cimmerians, remained, in, western, anatolia, and, warred, with, lydia, which, eventually, expelled, them, by, around, 620, bc, and, then, expanded, to, incorporate, phrygia, which, became, the, lydian, empire, s, eastern, frontier, the, gordium, site, reveals, a, considerable, building, program, during, the, 6th, century, bc, under, the, domination, of, lydian, kings, including, the, proverbially, rich, king, croesus, meanwhile, phrygia, s, former, eastern, subjects, fell, to, assyria, and, later, to, the, medes, there, may, be, an, echo, of, strife, with, lydia, and, perhaps, a, veiled, reference, to, royal, hostages, in, the, legend, of, the, twice, unlucky, phrygian, prince, adrastus, who, accidentally, killed, his, brother, and, exiled, himself, to, lydia, where, king, croesus, welcomed, him, once, again, adrastus, accidentally, killed, croesus, son, and, then, committed, suicide, some, time, in, the, 540s, bc, phrygia, passed, to, the, achaemenid, great, persian, empire, when, cyrus, the, great, conquered, lydia, after, darius, the, great, became, persian, emperor, in, 521, bc, he, remade, the, ancient, trade, route, into, the, persian, royal, road, and, instituted, administrative, reforms, that, included, setting, up, satrapies, the, phrygian, satrapy, province, lay, west, of, the, halys, river, now, k, z, l, river, and, east, of, mysia, and, lydia, its, capital, was, established, at, dascylium, modern, ergili, in, the, course, of, the, 5th, century, the, region, was, divided, in, two, administrative, satrapies, hellespontine, phrygia, and, greater, phrygia, the, macedonian, greek, conqueror, alexander, the, great, passed, through, gordium, in, 333, bc, and, severed, the, gordian, knot, in, the, temple, of, sabazios, zeus, according, to, a, legend, possibly, promulgated, by, alexander, s, publicists, whoever, untied, the, knot, would, be, master, of, asia, with, gordium, sited, on, the, persian, royal, road, that, led, through, the, heart, of, anatolia, the, prophecy, had, some, geographical, plausibility, with, alexander, phrygia, became, part, of, the, wider, hellenistic, world, upon, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, the, battle, of, ipsus, took, place, in, 301, bc, in, the, chaotic, period, after, alexander, s, death, northern, phrygia, was, overrun, by, celts, eventually, to, become, the, province, of, galatia, the, former, capital, of, gordium, was, captured, and, destroyed, by, the, gauls, soon, afterwards, and, disappeared, from, history, in, 188, bc, the, southern, remnant, of, phrygia, came, under, the, control, of, the, attalids, of, pergamon, however, the, phrygian, language, survived, although, now, written, in, the, greek, alphabet, in, 133, bc, the, remnants, of, phrygia, passed, to, rome, for, purposes, of, provincial, administration, the, romans, maintained, a, divided, phrygia, attaching, the, northeastern, part, to, the, province, of, galatia, and, the, western, portion, to, the, province, of, asia, there, is, some, evidence, that, western, phrygia, and, caria, were, separated, from, asia, in, 254, 259, to, become, the, new, province, of, phrygia, and, caria, during, the, reforms, of, diocletian, phrygia, was, divided, anew, into, two, provinces, phrygia, i, or, phrygia, salutaris, meaning, healthy, in, latin, and, phrygia, ii, or, pacatiana, greek, pakatiane, unknown, etymology, but, translated, as, peaceful, both, under, the, diocese, of, asia, salutaris, with, synnada, as, its, capital, comprised, the, eastern, portion, of, the, region, and, pacatiana, with, laodicea, on, the, lycus, as, capital, of, the, western, portion, the, provinces, survived, up, to, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, when, they, were, replaced, by, the, theme, system, in, the, late, roman, early, byzantine, period, most, of, phrygia, belonged, to, the, anatolic, theme, it, was, overrun, by, the, turks, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, of, manzikert, 1071, the, turks, had, taken, complete, control, in, the, 13th, century, but, the, ancient, name, of, phrygia, remained, in, use, until, the, last, remnant, of, the, byzantine, empire, was, conquered, by, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1453, the, phrygian, religion, in, antiquity, was, polytheistic, and, was, distinct, from, the, earlier, religions, of, the, anatolian, peoples, and, whose, pantheon, was, composed, of, deities, who, were, reflexes, of, earlier, aegean, balkan, ones, unlike, the, hittite, and, luwian, religions, the, phrygian, pantheon, was, headed, by, a, feminine, deity, a, goddess, matar, who, was, associated, with, mountains, and, wild, animals, and, was, given, the, epithet, of, kubeleya, or, kubileya, with, the, full, name, matar, kubeleya, thus, meaning, lit, mother, of, the, mountain, peaks, as, the, mountain, mother, ancient, greek, romanized, m, t, r, oreia, matar, was, the, mistress, of, wild, mountainous, landscapes, and, the, protectress, and, nurturer, of, the, wild, animals, living, there, matar, kubeleya, was, the, phrygian, reflex, of, an, earlier, aegean, balkan, goddess, whose, lydian, variant, was, the, goddess, kufaws, the, cult, of, matar, kubeleya, was, performed, by, priests, named, corybantes, meaning, lit, head, shakers, likely, in, mountainous, locations, and, through, orgiastic, rites, featuring, pipe, and, cymbal, music, and, ecstatic, dancing, with, her, name, also, characterising, her, as, the, goddess, of, head, shaking, and, the, ecstatic, state, caused, by, it, therefore, the, goddess, was, also, given, a, phrygian, epithet, meaning, frantic, in, reference, to, the, divine, frenzy, she, inspired, in, her, worshipers, and, recorded, in, greek, as, kub, bos, due, to, the, prominence, of, the, cult, of, matar, kubeleya, in, central, anatolia, during, the, iron, age, her, cult, spread, to, pisidia, and, later, to, the, greco, roman, world, under, the, name, of, kybele, ancient, greek, latin, cybele, the, storm, god, tiws, held, an, important, place, in, the, phrygian, pantheon, and, his, cult, was, widespread, in, phrygia, tiws, was, not, connected, to, the, earlier, anatolian, storm, god, tar, untas, and, was, instead, the, phrygian, variant, of, an, earlier, aegean, balkan, god, whose, lydian, and, greek, reflexes, were, lefs, and, zeus, also, cognate, with, the, italic, jovis, the, phrygian, moon, god, was, mas, who, was, known, in, greek, as, men, mas, was, the, phrygian, reflex, of, an, earlier, aegean, balkan, god, whose, lydian, variant, was, qa, iya, s, the, identity, and, gender, of, the, phrygian, deity, bas, are, still, unclear, artimis, was, a, potnia, theron, type, phrygian, goddess, who, was, the, reflex, of, an, older, aegean, balkan, goddess, whose, lydian, and, greek, variants, were, respectively, the, goddesses, artimus, and, artemis, the, earliest, traditions, of, greek, music, derived, from, phrygia, transmitted, through, the, greek, colonies, in, anatolia, and, included, the, phrygian, mode, which, was, considered, to, be, the, warlike, mode, in, ancient, greek, music, phrygian, midas, the, king, of, the, golden, touch, was, tutored, in, music, by, orpheus, himself, according, to, the, myth, another, musical, invention, that, came, from, phrygia, was, the, aulos, a, reed, instrument, with, two, pipes, classical, greek, iconography, identifies, the, trojan, paris, as, non, greek, by, his, phrygian, cap, which, was, worn, by, mithras, and, survived, into, modern, imagery, as, the, liberty, cap, of, the, american, and, french, revolutionaries, the, name, of, the, earliest, known, mythical, king, was, nannacus, aka, annacus, this, king, resided, at, iconium, the, most, eastern, city, of, the, kingdom, of, phrygia, at, that, time, and, after, his, death, at, the, age, of, 300, years, a, great, flood, overwhelmed, the, country, as, had, been, foretold, by, an, ancient, oracle, the, next, king, mentioned, in, extant, classical, sources, was, called, manis, or, masdes, according, to, plutarch, because, of, his, splendid, exploits, great, things, were, called, manic, in, phrygia, thereafter, the, kingdom, of, phrygia, seems, to, have, become, fragmented, among, various, kings, one, of, the, kings, was, tantalus, who, ruled, over, the, north, western, region, of, phrygia, around, mount, sipylus, tantalus, was, endlessly, punished, in, tartarus, because, he, allegedly, killed, his, son, pelops, and, sacrificially, offered, him, to, the, olympians, a, reference, to, the, suppression, of, human, sacrifice, tantalus, was, also, falsely, accused, of, stealing, from, the, lotteries, he, had, invented, in, the, mythic, age, before, the, trojan, war, during, a, time, of, an, interregnum, gordius, or, gordias, a, phrygian, farmer, became, king, fulfilling, an, oracular, prophecy, the, kingless, phrygians, had, turned, for, guidance, to, the, oracle, of, sabazios, zeus, to, the, greeks, at, telmissus, in, the, part, of, phrygia, that, later, became, part, of, galatia, they, had, been, instructed, by, the, oracle, to, acclaim, as, their, king, the, first, man, who, rode, up, to, the, god, s, temple, in, a, cart, that, man, was, gordias, gordios, gordius, a, farmer, who, dedicated, the, ox, cart, in, question, tied, to, its, shaft, with, the, gordian, knot, gordias, refounded, a, capital, at, gordium, in, west, central, anatolia, situated, on, the, old, trackway,

mythology, with, the, dactyls, minor, gods, credited, with, the, invention, of, iron, smelting, who, in, most, versions, of, the, legend, lived, at, mount, ida, in, phrygia, gordias, s, son, adopted, in, some, versions, was, midas, a, large, body, of, myths, and, legends, surround, this, first, king, midas, connecting, him, with, a, mythological, tale, concerning, attis, this, shadowy, figure, resided, at, pessinus, and, attempted, to, marry, his, daughter, to, the, young, attis, in, spite, of, the, opposition, of, his, lover, agdestis, and, his, mother, the, goddess, cybele, when, agdestis, and, or, cybele, appear, and, cast, madness, upon, the, members, of, the, wedding, feast, midas, is, said, to, have, died, in, the, ensuing, chaos, king, midas, is, said, to, have, associated, himself, with, silenus, and, other, satyrs, and, with, dionysus, who, granted, him, a, golden, touch, in, one, version, of, his, story, midas, travels, from, thrace, accompanied, by, a,
