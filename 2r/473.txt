between, the, union, the, north, and, the, confederacy, the, south, which, was, formed, in, 1861, by, states, that, had, seceded, from, the, union, the, central, conflict, leading, to, war, was, a, dispute, over, whether, slavery, should, be, permitted, to, expand, into, the, western, territories, leading, to, more, slave, states, or, be, prohibited, from, doing, so, which, many, believed, would, place, slavery, on, a, course, of, ultimate, extinction, decades, of, controversy, over, slavery, were, brought, to, a, head, when, abraham, lincoln, who, opposed, slavery, s, expansion, won, the, 1860, presidential, election, seven, southern, slave, states, responded, to, lincoln, s, victory, by, seceding, from, the, united, states, and, forming, the, confederacy, the, confederacy, seized, u, s, forts, and, other, federal, assets, within, their, borders, the, war, began, on, april, 12, 1861, when, the, confederacy, bombarded, fort, sumter, in, south, carolina, a, wave, of, enthusiasm, for, war, swept, over, north, and, south, as, military, recruitment, soared, four, more, southern, states, seceded, after, the, war, began, and, led, by, president, jefferson, davis, the, confederacy, asserted, control, over, a, third, of, the, u, s, population, in, eleven, states, four, years, of, intense, combat, mostly, in, the, south, ensued, during, 1861, 62, in, the, western, theater, the, union, made, permanent, gains, though, in, the, eastern, theater, the, conflict, was, inconclusive, the, abolition, of, slavery, became, a, union, war, goal, on, january, 1, 1863, when, lincoln, issued, the, emancipation, proclamation, which, declared, all, slaves, in, rebel, states, to, be, free, applying, to, more, than, 3, 5, million, of, the, 4, million, enslaved, people, in, the, country, to, the, west, the, union, first, destroyed, the, confederacy, s, river, navy, by, the, summer, of, 1862, then, much, of, its, western, armies, and, seized, new, orleans, the, successful, 1863, union, siege, of, vicksburg, split, the, confederacy, in, two, at, the, mississippi, river, while, confederate, general, robert, e, lee, s, incursion, north, failed, at, the, battle, of, gettysburg, western, successes, led, to, general, ulysses, s, grant, s, command, of, all, union, armies, in, 1864, inflicting, an, ever, tightening, naval, blockade, of, confederate, ports, the, union, marshaled, resources, and, manpower, to, attack, the, confederacy, from, all, directions, this, led, to, the, fall, of, atlanta, in, 1864, to, union, general, william, tecumseh, sherman, followed, by, his, march, to, the, sea, the, last, significant, battles, raged, around, the, ten, month, siege, of, petersburg, gateway, to, the, confederate, capital, of, richmond, the, confederates, abandoned, richmond, and, on, april, 9, 1865, lee, surrendered, to, grant, following, the, battle, of, appomattox, court, house, setting, in, motion, the, end, of, the, war, lincoln, lived, to, see, this, victory, but, on, april, 14, was, assassinated, dying, the, next, day, by, the, end, of, the, war, much, of, the, south, s, infrastructure, was, destroyed, the, confederacy, collapsed, slavery, was, abolished, and, four, million, enslaved, black, people, were, freed, the, war, torn, nation, then, entered, the, reconstruction, era, in, an, attempt, to, rebuild, the, country, bring, the, former, confederate, states, back, into, the, united, states, and, grant, civil, rights, to, freed, slaves, the, war, is, one, of, the, most, extensively, studied, and, written, about, episodes, in, u, s, history, it, remains, the, subject, of, cultural, and, historiographical, debate, of, particular, interest, is, the, persisting, myth, of, the, lost, cause, of, the, confederacy, the, war, was, among, the, first, to, use, industrial, warfare, railroads, the, electrical, telegraph, steamships, the, ironclad, warship, and, mass, produced, weapons, were, widely, used, the, war, left, between, 620, 000, 750, 000, soldiers, dead, along, with, an, undetermined, number, of, civilian, casualties, making, the, civil, war, the, deadliest, military, conflict, in, american, history, the, technology, and, brutality, of, the, civil, war, foreshadowed, the, coming, world, wars, a, consensus, of, historians, who, address, the, origins, of, the, war, agree, that, the, preservation, of, the, institution, of, slavery, was, the, principal, aim, of, the, eleven, southern, states, seven, states, before, the, onset, of, the, war, and, four, states, after, the, onset, that, declared, their, secession, from, the, united, states, the, union, and, united, to, form, the, confederate, states, of, america, known, as, the, confederacy, however, while, historians, in, the, 21st, century, agree, on, the, centrality, of, slavery, in, the, conflict, they, disagree, sharply, on, which, aspects, of, this, conflict, ideological, economic, political, or, social, were, most, important, and, on, the, north, s, reasons, for, refusing, to, allow, the, southern, states, to, secede, proponents, of, the, pseudo, historical, lost, cause, ideology, have, denied, that, slavery, was, the, principal, cause, of, the, secession, a, view, that, has, been, disproven, by, the, overwhelming, historical, evidence, against, it, notably, some, of, the, seceding, states, own, secession, documents, the, principal, political, battle, leading, to, southern, secession, was, over, whether, slavery, would, be, permitted, to, expand, into, the, western, territories, destined, to, become, states, initially, congress, had, admitted, new, states, into, the, union, in, pairs, one, slave, and, one, free, this, had, kept, a, sectional, balance, in, the, senate, but, not, in, the, house, of, representatives, as, free, states, outstripped, slave, states, in, numbers, of, eligible, voters, thus, at, mid, 19th, century, the, free, versus, slave, status, of, the, new, territories, was, a, critical, issue, both, for, the, north, where, anti, slavery, sentiment, had, grown, and, for, the, south, where, the, fear, of, slavery, s, abolition, had, grown, another, factor, leading, to, secession, and, the, formation, of, the, confederacy, was, the, development, of, white, southern, nationalism, in, the, preceding, decades, the, primary, reason, for, the, north, to, reject, secession, was, to, preserve, the, union, a, cause, based, on, american, nationalism, background, factors, in, the, run, up, to, the, civil, war, were, partisan, politics, abolitionism, nullification, versus, secession, southern, and, northern, nationalism, expansionism, economics, and, modernization, in, the, antebellum, period, as, a, panel, of, historians, emphasized, in, 2011, while, slavery, and, its, various, and, multifaceted, discontents, were, the, primary, cause, of, disunion, it, was, disunion, itself, that, sparked, the, war, historian, david, m, potter, wrote, the, problem, for, americans, who, in, the, age, of, lincoln, wanted, slaves, to, be, free, was, not, simply, that, southerners, wanted, the, opposite, but, that, they, themselves, cherished, a, conflicting, value, they, wanted, the, constitution, which, protected, slavery, to, be, honored, and, the, union, which, was, a, fellowship, with, slaveholders, to, be, preserved, thus, they, were, committed, to, values, that, could, not, logically, be, reconciled, lincoln, s, election, in, november, 1860, was, the, final, trigger, for, secession, southern, leaders, feared, lincoln, would, stop, slavery, s, expansion, and, put, it, on, a, course, toward, extinction, however, lincoln, would, not, be, inaugurated, until, march, 4, 1861, which, gave, the, south, time, to, secede, and, prepare, for, war, during, the, winter, of, 1860, 61, according, to, lincoln, the, american, people, had, shown, they, had, been, successful, in, establishing, and, administering, a, republic, but, a, third, challenge, faced, the, nation, maintaining, a, republic, based, on, the, people, s, vote, in, the, face, of, an, attempt, to, destroy, it, lincoln, s, election, provoked, south, carolina, s, legislature, to, call, a, state, convention, to, consider, secession, south, carolina, had, done, more, than, any, other, state, to, advance, the, notion, that, a, state, had, the, right, to, nullify, federal, laws, and, even, secede, on, december, 20, 1860, the, convention, unanimously, voted, to, secede, and, adopted, a, secession, declaration, it, argued, for, states, rights, for, slave, owners, but, complained, about, states, rights, in, the, north, in, the, form, of, resistance, to, the, federal, fugitive, slave, act, claiming, that, northern, states, were, not, fulfilling, their, obligations, to, assist, in, the, return, of, fugitive, slaves, the, cotton, states, of, mississippi, florida, alabama, georgia, louisiana, and, texas, followed, suit, seceding, in, january, and, february, 1861, among, the, ordinances, of, secession, those, of, texas, alabama, and, virginia, mentioned, the, plight, of, the, slaveholding, states, at, the, hands, of, northern, abolitionists, the, rest, made, no, mention, of, slavery, but, were, brief, announcements, by, the, legislatures, of, the, dissolution, of, ties, to, the, union, however, at, least, four, south, carolina, mississippi, georgia, and, texas, provided, detailed, reasons, for, their, secession, all, blaming, the, movement, to, abolish, slavery, and, its, influence, over, the, north, southern, states, believed, that, the, fugitive, slave, clause, made, slaveholding, a, constitutional, right, these, states, agreed, to, form, a, new, federal, government, the, confederate, states, of, america, on, february, 4, 1861, they, took, control, of, federal, forts, and, other, properties, within, their, boundaries, with, little, resistance, from, outgoing, president, james, buchanan, whose, term, ended, on, march, 4, buchanan, said, the, dred, scott, decision, was, proof, the, southern, states, had, no, reason, to, secede, and, that, the, union, was, intended, to, be, perpetual, he, added, however, that, the, power, by, force, of, arms, to, compel, a, state, to, remain, in, the, union, was, not, among, the, enumerated, powers, granted, to, congress, a, quarter, of, the, us, army, the, texas, garrison, was, surrendered, in, february, to, state, forces, by, its, general, david, e, twiggs, who, joined, the, confederacy, as, southerners, resigned, their, senate, and, house, seats, republicans, could, pass, projects, that, had, been, blocked, these, included, the, morrill, tariff, land, grant, colleges, a, homestead, act, a, transcontinental, railroad, the, national, bank, act, authorization, of, united, states, notes, by, the, legal, tender, act, of, 1862, and, the, end, of, slavery, in, the, district, of, columbia, the, revenue, act, of, 1861, introduced, income, tax, to, help, finance, the, war, in, december, 1860, the, crittenden, compromise, was, proposed, to, re, establish, the, missouri, compromise, line, by, constitutionally, banning, slavery, in, territories, to, the, north, of, it, while, permitting, it, to, the, south, the, compromise, would, likely, have, prevented, secession, but, lincoln, and, the, republicans, rejected, it, lincoln, stated, that, any, compromise, that, would, extend, slavery, would, bring, down, the, union, a, february, peace, conference, met, in, washington, proposing, a, solution, similar, the, compromise, it, was, rejected, by, congress, the, republicans, proposed, the, corwin, amendment, an, alternative, not, to, interfere, with, slavery, where, it, existed, but, the, south, regarded, it, as, insufficient, the, remaining, eight, slave, states, rejected, pleas, to, join, the, confederacy, following, a, no, vote, in, virginia, s, first, secessionist, convention, on, april, 4, on, march, 4, lincoln, was, sworn, in, as, president, in, his, inaugural, address, he, argued, that, the, constitution, was, a, more, perfect, union, than, the, earlier, articles, of, confederation, and, perpetual, union, was, a, binding, contract, and, called, secession, legally, void, he, did, not, intend, to, invade, southern, states, nor, to, end, slavery, where, it, existed, but, he, said, he, would, use, force, to, maintain, possession, of, federal, property, including, forts, arsenals, mints, and, customhouses, that, had, been, seized, the, government, would, not, try, to, recover, post, offices, and, if, resisted, mail, delivery, would, end, at, state, lines, where, conditions, did, not, allow, peaceful, enforcement, of, federal, law, us, marshals, and, judges, would, be, withdrawn, no, mention, was, made, of, bullion, lost, from, mints, he, stated, that, it, would, be, us, policy, to, collect, the, duties, and, imposts, there, will, be, no, invasion, no, using, of, force, against, or, among, the, people, anywhere, that, would, justify, an, armed, revolution, his, speech, closed, with, a, plea, for, restoration, of, the, bonds, of, union, famously, calling, on, the, mystic, chords, of, memory, binding, the, two, regions, the, davis, government, of, the, new, confederacy, sent, delegates, to, washington, to, negotiate, a, peace, treaty, lincoln, rejected, negotiations, because, he, claimed, that, the, confederacy, was, not, a, legitimate, government, and, to, make, a, treaty, with, it, would, recognize, it, as, such, lincoln, instead, attempted, to, negotiate, directly, with, the, governors, of, seceded, states, whose, administrations, he, continued, to, recognize, complicating, lincoln, s, attempts, to, defuse, the, crisis, was, secretary, of, state, william, h, seward, who, had, been, lincoln, s, rival, for, the, republican, nomination, embittered, by, his, defeat, seward, agreed, to, support, lincoln, s, candidacy, only, after, he, was, guaranteed, the, executive, office, then, considered, the, second, most, powerful, in, the, early, stages, of, lincoln, s, presidency, seward, held, little, regard, for, him, due, to, his, perceived, inexperience, seward, viewed, himself, as, the, de, facto, head, of, government, the, prime, minister, behind, the, throne, seward, attempted, to, engage, in, unauthorized, and, indirect, negotiations, that, failed, lincoln, was, determined, to, hold, all, remaining, union, occupied, forts, in, the, confederacy, fort, monroe, in, virginia, fort, pickens, fort, jefferson, and, fort, taylor, in, florida, and, fort, sumter, in, south, carolina, the, american, civil, war, began, on, april, 12, 1861, when, confederate, forces, opened, fire, on, the, union, held, fort, sumter, fort, sumter, is, located, in, the, harbor, of, charleston, south, carolina, its, status, had, been, contentious, for, months, outgoing, president, buchanan, had, dithered, in, reinforcing, its, garrison, commanded, by, major, robert, anderson, anderson, took, matters, into, his, own, hands, and, on, december, 26, 1860, under, the, cover, of, darkness, sailed, the, garrison, from, the, poorly, placed, fort, moultrie, to, the, stalwart, island, fort, sumter, anderson, s, actions, catapulted, him, to, hero, status, in, the, north, an, attempt, to, resupply, the, fort, on, january, 9, 1861, failed, and, nearly, started, the, war, then, but, an, informal, truce, held, on, march, 5, lincoln, was, informed, the, fort, was, low, on, supplies, fort, sumter, proved, a, key, challenge, to, lincoln, s, administration, back, channel, dealing, by, seward, with, the, confederates, undermined, lincoln, s, decision, making, seward, wanted, to, pull, out, but, a, firm, hand, by, lincoln, tamed, seward, who, was, a, staunch, lincoln, ally, lincoln, decided, holding, the, fort, which, would, require, reinforcing, it, was, the, only, workable, option, on, april, 6, lincoln, informed, the, governor, of, south, carolina, that, a, ship, with, food, but, no, ammunition, would, attempt, to, supply, the, fort, historian, mcpherson, describes, this, win, win, approach, as, the, first, sign, of, the, mastery, that, would, mark, lincoln, s, presidency, the, union, would, win, if, it, could, resupply, and, hold, the, fort, and, the, south, would, be, the, aggressor, if, it, opened, fire, on, an, unarmed, ship, supplying, starving, men, an, april, 9, confederate, cabinet, meeting, resulted, in, davis, ordering, general, p, g, t, beauregard, to, take, the, fort, before, supplies, reached, it, at, 4, 30, am, on, april,

its, southern, neighbors, voting, to, close, maryland, s, rail, lines, to, prevent, their, use, for, war, lincoln, responded, by, establishing, martial, law, and, unilaterally, suspending, habeas, corpus, in, maryland, along, with, sending, in, militia, units, lincoln, took, control, of, maryland, and, the, district, of, columbia, by, seizing, prominent, figures, including, arresting, one,

for, men, aged, 18, 35, with, exemptions, for, overseers, government, officials, and, clergymen, the, u, s, congress, followed, in, july, authorizing, a, militia, draft, within, states, that, could,

least, 100, 000, southerners, deserted, about, 10, percent, of, the, total, southern, desertion, was, high, because, many, soldiers, were, more, concerned, about, the, fate, of, their, local, area,

some, european, observers, at, the, time, dismissed, them, as, amateur, and, unprofessional, but, historian, john, keegan, concluded, that, each, outmatched, the, french, prussian, and, russian, armies, and, without, the, atlantic, could, have, threatened, any, of, them, with, defeat, at, the, war, s, start, a, parole, system, operated, under, which, captives, agreed, not, to, fight, until, exchanged, they, were, held, in, camps, run, by, their, army, paid, but, not, allowed, to, perform, any, military, duties, the, system, of, exchanges, collapsed, in, 1863, when, the, confederacy, refused, to, exchange, black, prisoners, after, that, about, 56, 000, of, the, 409, 000, pows, died, in, prisons, accounting, for, 10, percent, of, the, conflict, s, fatalities, historian, elizabeth, d, leonard, writes, that, between, 500, and, 1, 000, women, enlisted, as, soldiers, on, both, sides, disguised, as, men, women, also, served, as, spies, resistance, activists, nurses, and, hospital, personnel, women, served, on, the, union, hospital, ship, red, rover, and, nursed, union, and, confederate, troops, at, field, hospitals, mary, edwards, walker, the, only, woman, ever, to, receive, the, medal, of, honor, served, in, the, union, army, and, was, given, the, medal, for, treating, the, wounded, during, the, war, the, small, u, s, navy, of, 1861, rapidly, expanded, to, 6, 000, officers, and, 45, 000, sailors, by, 1865, with, 671, vessels, totaling, 510, 396, tons, its, mission, was, to, blockade, confederate, ports, control, the, river, system, defend, against, confederate, raiders, on, the, high, seas, and, be, ready, for, a, possible, war, with, the, british, royal, navy, the, main, riverine, war, was, fought, in, the, west, where, major, rivers, gave, access, to, the, confederate, heartland, the, u, s, navy, eventually, controlled, the, red, tennessee, cumberland, mississippi, and, ohio, rivers, in, the, east, the, navy, shelled, confederate, forts, and, supported, coastal, army, operations, the, civil, war, occurred, during, the, early, stages, of, the, industrial, revolution, leading, to, naval, innovations, notably, the, ironclad, warship, the, confederacy, recognizing, the, need, to, counter, the, union, s, naval, superiority, built, or, converted, over, 130, vessels, including, 26, ironclads, despite, efforts, confederate, ships, were, largely, unsuccessful, against, union, ironclads, the, union, navy, used, timberclads, tinclads, and, armored, gunboats, shipyards, in, cairo, illinois, and, st, louis, built, or, modified, steamboats, the, confederacy, experimented, with, the, submarine, css, hunley, which, was, not, successful, and, with, the, ironclad, css, virginia, rebuilt, from, the, sunken, union, ship, merrimack, on, march, 8, 1862, virginia, inflicted, significant, damage, on, the, union, s, wooden, fleet, but, the, next, day, the, first, union, ironclad, uss, monitor, arrived, to, challenge, it, in, the, chesapeake, bay, the, resulting, three, hour, battle, of, hampton, roads, was, a, draw, proving, ironclads, were, effective, warships, the, confederacy, scuttled, the, virginia, to, prevent, its, capture, while, the, union, built, many, copies, of, the, monitor, the, confederacy, s, efforts, to, obtain, warships, from, great, britain, failed, as, britain, had, no, interest, in, selling, warships, to, a, nation, at, war, with, a, stronger, enemy, and, feared, souring, relations, with, the, u, s, by, early, 1861, general, winfield, scott, had, devised, the, anaconda, plan, to, win, the, war, with, minimal, bloodshed, calling, for, a, blockade, of, the, confederacy, to, suffocate, the, south, into, surrender, lincoln, adopted, parts, of, the, plan, but, opted, for, a, more, active, war, strategy, in, april, 1861, lincoln, announced, a, blockade, of, all, southern, ports, commercial, ships, could, not, get, insurance, ending, regular, traffic, the, south, blundered, by, embargoing, cotton, exports, before, the, blockade, was, fully, effective, by, the, time, they, reversed, this, decision, it, was, too, late, king, cotton, was, dead, as, the, south, could, export, less, than, 10, of, its, cotton, the, blockade, shut, down, the, ten, confederate, seaports, with, railheads, that, moved, almost, all, the, cotton, by, june, 1861, warships, were, stationed, off, the, principal, southern, ports, and, a, year, later, nearly, 300, ships, were, in, service, the, confederates, began, the, war, short, on, military, supplies, which, the, agrarian, south, could, not, produce, northern, arms, manufacturers, were, restricted, by, an, embargo, ending, existing, and, future, contracts, with, the, south, the, confederacy, turned, to, foreign, sources, connecting, with, financiers, and, companies, like, s, isaac, campbell, company, and, the, london, armoury, company, in, britain, becoming, the, confederacy, s, main, source, of, arms, to, transport, arms, safely, to, the, confederacy, british, investors, built, small, fast, steam, driven, blockade, runners, that, traded, arms, and, supplies, from, britain, through, bermuda, cuba, and, the, bahamas, in, exchange, for, high, priced, cotton, many, were, lightweight, and, designed, for, speed, only, carrying, small, amounts, of, cotton, back, to, england, when, the, union, navy, seized, a, blockade, runner, the, ship, and, cargo, were, condemned, as, a, prize, of, war, and, sold, with, proceeds, given, to, the, navy, sailors, the, captured, crewmen, mostly, british, were, released, the, southern, economy, nearly, collapsed, during, the, war, due, to, multiple, factors, severe, food, shortages, failing, railroads, loss, of, control, over, key, rivers, foraging, by, northern, armies, and, the, seizure, of, animals, and, crops, by, confederate, forces, historians, agree, the, blockade, was, a, major, factor, in, ruining, the, confederate, economy, however, wise, argues, blockade, runners, provided, enough, of, a, lifeline, to, allow, lee, to, continue, fighting, for, additional, months, thanks, to, supplies, like, 400, 000, rifles, lead, blankets, and, boots, that, the, homefront, economy, could, no, longer, supply, surdam, contends, that, the, blockade, was, a, powerful, weapon, that, eventually, ruined, the, southern, economy, costing, few, lives, in, combat, the, confederate, cotton, crop, became, nearly, useless, cutting, off, the, confederacy, s, primary, income, source, critical, imports, were, scarce, and, coastal, trade, largely, ended, as, well, the, blockade, s, success, was, not, measured, by, the, few, ships, that, slipped, through, but, by, the, thousands, that, never, tried, european, merchant, ships, could, not, get, insurance, and, were, too, slow, to, evade, the, blockade, so, they, stopped, calling, at, confederate, ports, to, fight, an, offensive, war, the, confederacy, purchased, arms, in, britain, and, converted, british, built, ships, into, commerce, raiders, the, smuggling, of, 600, 000, arms, enabled, the, confederacy, to, fight, on, for, two, more, years, and, the, commerce, raiders, targeted, u, s, merchant, marine, ships, in, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, insurance, rates, soared, and, the, american, flag, virtually, disappeared, from, international, waters, though, reflagging, ships, with, european, flags, allowed, them, to, continue, operating, unmolested, after, the, war, the, u, s, government, demanded, britain, compensate, it, for, the, damage, caused, by, blockade, runners, and, raiders, outfitted, in, british, ports, britain, paid, the, u, s, 15, million, in, 1871, but, only, for, commerce, raiding, din, aslan, argues, that, another, outcome, of, the, blockade, was, the, rise, of, oil, as, a, prominent, commodity, the, declining, whale, oil, industry, took, a, blow, as, many, old, whaling, ships, were, used, in, blockade, efforts, such, as, the, stone, fleet, and, confederate, raiders, harassed, union, whalers, oil, products, especially, kerosene, began, replacing, whale, oil, in, lamps, increasing, oil, s, importance, long, before, it, became, fuel, for, combustion, engines, although, the, confederacy, hoped, britain, and, france, would, join, them, against, the, union, this, was, never, likely, so, they, sought, to, bring, them, in, as, mediators, the, union, worked, to, block, this, and, threatened, war, if, any, country, recognized, the, confederacy, in, 1861, southerners, voluntarily, embargoed, cotton, shipments, hoping, to, start, an, economic, depression, in, europe, that, would, force, britain, to, enter, the, war, but, this, failed, worse, europe, turned, to, egypt, and, india, for, cotton, which, they, found, superior, hindering, the, south, s, post, war, recovery, cotton, diplomacy, proved, a, failure, as, europe, had, a, surplus, of, cotton, while, the, 1860, 62, crop, failures, in, europe, made, the, north, s, grain, exports, critically, important, it, also, helped, turn, european, opinion, against, the, confederacy, it, was, said, that, king, corn, was, more, powerful, than, king, cotton, as, u, s, grain, went, from, a, quarter, to, almost, half, of, british, imports, meanwhile, the, war, created, jobs, for, arms, makers, ironworkers, and, ships, to, transport, weapons, lincoln, s, administration, initially, struggled, to, appeal, to, european, public, opinion, at, first, diplomats, explained, that, the, u, s, was, not, committed, to, ending, slavery, and, emphasized, legal, arguments, about, the, unconstitutionality, of, secession, confederate, representatives, however, focused, on, their, struggle, for, liberty, commitment, to, free, trade, and, the, essential, role, of, cotton, in, the, european, economy, the, european, aristocracy, was, absolutely, gleeful, in, pronouncing, the, american, debacle, as, proof, that, the, entire, experiment, in, popular, government, had, failed, european, government, leaders, welcomed, the, fragmentation, of, the, ascendant, american, republic, however, a, european, public, with, liberal, sensibilities, remained, which, the, u, s, sought, to, appeal, to, by, building, connections, with, the, international, press, by, 1861, union, diplomats, like, carl, schurz, realized, emphasizing, the, war, against, slavery, was, the, union, s, most, effective, moral, asset, in, swaying, european, public, opinion, seward, was, concerned, an, overly, radical, case, for, reunification, would, distress, european, merchants, with, cotton, interests, even, so, he, supported, a, widespread, campaign, of, public, diplomacy, u, s, minister, to, britain, charles, francis, adams, proved, adept, and, convinced, britain, not, to, challenge, the, union, blockade, the, confederacy, purchased, warships, from, commercial, shipbuilders, in, britain, with, the, most, famous, being, the, css, alabama, which, caused, considerable, damage, and, led, to, serious, postwar, disputes, however, public, opinion, against, slavery, in, britain, created, a, political, liability, for, politicians, where, the, anti, slavery, movement, was, powerful, war, loomed, in, late, 1861, between, the, u, s, and, britain, over, the, trent, affair, which, began, when, u, s, navy, personnel, boarded, the, british, ship, trent, and, seized, two, confederate, diplomats, however, london, and, washington, smoothed, this, over, after, lincoln, released, the, two, men, prince, albert, left, his, deathbed, to, issue, diplomatic, instructions, to, lord, lyons, during, the, trent, affair, his, request, was, honored, and, as, a, result, the, british, response, to, the, u, s, was, toned, down, helping, avert, war, in, 1862, the, british, government, considered, mediating, between, the, union, and, confederacy, though, such, an, offer, would, have, risked, war, with, the, u, s, british, prime, minister, lord, palmerston, reportedly, read, uncle, tom, s, cabin, three, times, when, deciding, what, his, decision, would, be, the, union, victory, at, the, battle, of, antietam, caused, the, british, to, delay, this, decision, the, emancipation, proclamation, increased, the, political, liability, of, supporting, the, confederacy, realizing, that, washington, could, not, intervene, in, mexico, as, long, as, the, confederacy, controlled, texas, france, invaded, mexico, in, 1861, and, installed, the, habsburg, austrian, archduke, maximilian, i, as, emperor, washington, repeatedly, protested, france, s, violation, of, the, monroe, doctrine, despite, sympathy, for, the, confederacy, france, s, seizure, of, mexico, ultimately, deterred, it, from, war, with, the, union, confederate, offers, late, in, the, war, to, end, slavery, in, return, for, diplomatic, recognition, were, not, seriously, considered, by, london, or, paris, after, 1863, the, polish, revolt, against, russia, further, distracted, the, european, powers, and, ensured, they, remained, neutral, russia, supported, the, union, largely, because, it, believed, the, u, s, served, as, a, counterbalance, to, its, geopolitical, rival, the, u, k, in, 1863, the, russian, navy, s, baltic, and, pacific, fleets, wintered, in, the, american, ports, of, new, york, and, san, francisco, respectively, the, eastern, theater, refers, to, the, military, operations, east, of, the, appalachian, mountains, including, virginia, west,

union, army, of, the, potomac, on, july, 26, 1861, and, the, war, began, in, earnest, in, 1862, the, 1862, union, strategy, called, for, simultaneous, advances, along, four, axes, the, primary, confederate, force, in, the, eastern, theater, was, the, army, of, northern, virginia, the, army, originated, as, the, confederate, army, of, the, potomac, which, was, organized, on, june, 20, 1861, from, all, operational, forces, in, northern, virginia, on, july, 20, and, 21, the, army, of, the, shenandoah, and, forces, from, the, district, of, harpers, ferry, were, added, units, from, the, army, of, the, northwest, were, merged, into, the, army, of, the, potomac, between, march, 14, and, may, 17, 1862, the, army, of, the, potomac, was, renamed, army, of, northern, virginia, on, march, 14, the, army, of, the, peninsula, was, merged, into, it, on, april, 12, 1862, when, virginia, declared, its, secession, in, april, 1861, robert, e, lee, chose, to, follow, his, home, state, despite, his, desire, for, the, country, to, remain, intact, and, an, offer, of, a, senior, union, command, lee, s, biographer, douglas, s, freeman, asserts, that, the, army, received, its, final, name, from, lee, when, he, issued, orders, assuming, command, on, june, 1, 1862, however, freeman, does, admit, that, lee, corresponded, with, brigadier, general, joseph, e, johnston, his, predecessor, in, army, command, before, that, date, and, referred, to, johnston, s, command, as, the, army, of, northern, virginia, part, of, the, confusion, results, from, the, fact, johnston, commanded, the, department, of, northern, virginia, as, of, october, 22, 1861, and, the, name, army, of, northern, virginia, can, be, seen, as, an, informal, consequence, of, its, parent, department, s, name, jefferson, davis, and, johnston, did, not, adopt, the, name, but, it, is, clear, the, organization, of, units, as, of, march, 14, was, the, same, organization, that, lee, received, on, june, 1, and, thus, it, is, generally, referred, to, today, as, the, army, of, northern, virginia, even, if, that, is, correct, only, in, retrospect, on, july, 4, at, harper, s, ferry, colonel, thomas, j, jackson, assigned, jeb, stuart, to, command, all, the, cavalry, companies, of, the, army, of, the, shenandoah, he, eventually, commanded, the, army, of, northern, virginia, s, cavalry, in, july, 1861, in, of, the, first, highly, visible, battles, union, troops, under, the, command, of, maj, gen, irvin, mcdowell, attacking, confederate, forces, led, by, beauregard, near, washington, were, repulsed, at, the, first, battle, of, bull, run, the, union, had, the, upper, hand, at, first, nearly, pushing, confederate, forces, holding, a, defensive, position, into, a, rout, but, confederate, reinforcements, under, joseph, e, johnston, arrived, from, the, shenandoah, valley, by, railroad, and, the, course, of, the, battle, quickly, changed, a, brigade, of, virginians, under, the, relatively, unknown, brigadier, general, from, the, virginia, military, institute, thomas, j, jackson, stood, its, ground, which, resulted, in, jackson, s, receiving, his, famous, nickname, stonewall, upon, the, urging, of, lincoln, to, begin, offensive, operations, mcclellan, attacked, virginia, in, the, spring, of, 1862, by, way, of, the, peninsula, between, the, york, river, and, james, river, southeast, of, richmond, mcclellan, s, army, reached, the, gates, of, richmond, in, the, peninsula, campaign, also, in, the, spring, of, 1862, in, the, shenandoah, valley, stonewall, jackson, led, his, valley, campaign, audaciously, employing, rapid, unpredictable, movements, on, interior, lines, jackson, s, 17, 000, troops, marched, 646, miles, 1, 040, km, in, 48, days, and, won, minor, battles, as, they, successfully, engaged, three, union, armies, 52, 000, men, including, those, of, nathaniel, p, banks, and, john, c, fremont, preventing, them, from, reinforcing, the, union, offensive, against, richmond, the, swiftness, of, jackson, s, men, earned, them, the, nickname, of, foot, cavalry, johnston, halted, mcclellan, s, advance, at, the, battle, of, seven, pines, but, he, was, wounded, in, the, battle, and, robert, e, lee, assumed, his, position, of, command, lee, and, top, subordinates, james, longstreet, and, stonewall, jackson, defeated, mcclellan, in, the, seven, days, battles, and, forced, his, retreat, the, northern, virginia, campaign, which, included, the, second, battle, of, bull, run, ended, in, yet, another, victory, for, the, south, mcclellan, resisted, general, in, chief, halleck, s, orders, to, send, reinforcements, to, john, pope, s, union, army, of, virginia, which, made, it, easier, for, lee, s, confederates, to, defeat, twice, the, number, of, combined, enemy, troops, emboldened, by, second, bull, run, the, confederacy, made, its, first, invasion, of, the, north, with, the, maryland, campaign, lee, led, 45, 000, troops, of, the, army, of, northern, virginia, across, the, potomac, river, into, maryland, on, september, 5, lincoln, then, restored, pope, s, troops, to, mcclellan, mcclellan, and, lee, fought, at, the, battle, of, antietam, near, sharpsburg, maryland, on, september, 17, 1862, the, bloodiest, single, day, in, us, military, history, lee, s, army, checked, at, last, returned, to, virginia, before, mcclellan, could, destroy, it, antietam, is, considered, a, union, victory, because, it, halted, lee, s, invasion, of, the, north, and, provided, an, opportunity, for, lincoln, to, announce, his, emancipation, proclamation, when, the, cautious, mcclellan, failed, to, follow, up, on, antietam, he, was, replaced, by, maj, gen, ambrose, burnside, burnside, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, fredericksburg, on, december, 13, 1862, when, more, than, 12, 000, union, soldiers, were, killed, or, wounded, during, futile, frontal, assaults, against, marye, s, heights, after, the, battle, burnside, was, replaced, by, maj, gen, joseph, hooker, hooker, too, proved, unable, to, defeat, lee, s, army, despite, outnumbering, the, confederates, by, more, than, two, to, one, his, chancellorsville, campaign, proved, ineffective, and, he, was, humiliated, in, the, battle, of, chancellorsville, in, may, 1863, chancellorsville, is, known, as, lee, s, perfect, battle, because, his, risky, decision, to, divide, his, army, in, the, presence, of, a, much, larger, enemy, force, resulted, in, a, significant, confederate, victory, stonewall, jackson, was, shot, in, the, left, arm, and, right, hand, by, friendly, fire, during, the, battle, the, arm, was, amputated, but, he, died, of, pneumonia, lee, famously, said, he, has, lost, his, left, arm, but, i, have, lost, my, right, arm, the, fiercest, fighting, of, the, battle, and, the, second, bloodiest, day, of, the, civil, war, occurred, on, may, 3, as, lee, launched, multiple, attacks, against, the, union, position, at, chancellorsville, that, same, day, john, sedgwick, advanced, across, the, rappahannock, river, defeated, the, small, confederate, force, at, marye, s, heights, in, the, second, battle, of, fredericksburg, and, then, moved, to, the, west, the, confederates, fought, a, successful, delaying, action, at, the, battle, of, salem, church, gen, hooker, was, replaced, by, maj, gen, george, meade, during, lee, s, second, invasion, of, the, north, in, june, meade, defeated, lee, at, the, battle, of, gettysburg, july, 1863, this, was, the, bloodiest, battle, and, has, been, called, the, war, s, turning, point, pickett, s, charge, on, july, 3, is, considered, the, high, water, mark, of, the, confederacy, because, it, signaled, the, collapse, of, serious, confederate, threats, of, victory, lee, s, army, suffered, 28, 000, casualties, versus, meade, s, 23, 000, the, western, theater, refers, to, military, operations, between, the, appalachian, mountains, and, the, mississippi, river, including, alabama, georgia, florida, mississippi, north, carolina, kentucky, south, carolina, tennessee, and, parts, of, louisiana, the, primary, union, forces, in, this, theater, were, the, army, of, the, tennessee, and, army, of, the, cumberland, named, for, the, two, rivers, tennessee, river, and, cumberland, river, after, meade, s, inconclusive, fall, campaign, lincoln, turned, to, the, western, theater, for, new, leadership, at, the, same,

leader, lincoln, needed, ulysses, s, grant, the, primary, confederate, force, in, the, western, theater, was, the, army, of, tennessee, the, army, was, formed, on, november, 20, 1862, when, general, braxton, bragg, renamed, the, former, army, of, mississippi, while, the, confederate, forces, had, successes, in, the, eastern, theater, they, were, defeated, many, times, in, the, west, the, union,

nickname, of, unconditional, surrender, grant, with, these, victories, the, union, gained, control, of, the, tennessee, and, cumberland, rivers, nathan, bedford, forrest, rallied, nearly, 4, 000, confederate, troops, and, led, them, to, escape, across, the, cumberland, nashville, and, central, tennessee, thus, fell, to, the, union, leading, to, attrition, of, local, food, supplies, and, livestock, and, a, breakdown, in, social, organization, confederate, general, leonidas, polk, s, invasion, of, columbus, ended, kentucky, s, policy, of, neutrality, and, turned, it, against, the,

tennessee, in, march, 1862, at, the, battle, of, shiloh, in, shiloh, tennessee, in, april, 1862, the, confederates, made, a, surprise, attack, that, pushed, union, forces, against, the, river, as,

effective, end, date, of, the, war, on, june, 2, with, most, of, his, troops, having, already, gone, home, a, reluctant, kirby, smith, had, little, choice, but, to, sign, the, official, surrender,

announced, general, order, no, 3, bringing, the, emancipation, proclamation, into, effect, in, texas, and, freeing, the, last, slaves, of, the, confederacy, the, anniversary, of, this, date, is, now, celebrated, as, juneteenth, the, naval, part, of, the, war, ended, more, slowly, it, had, begun, on, april, 11, two, days, after, lee, s, surrender, when, lincoln, proclaimed, that, foreign, nations, had, no, further, claim, or, pretense, to, deny, equality, of, maritime, rights, and, hospitalities, to, u, s, warships, and, in, effect, that, rights, extended, to, confederate, ships, to, use, neutral, ports, as, safe, havens, from, u, s, warships, should, end, having, no, response, to, lincoln, s, proclamation, president, johnson, issued, a, similar, proclamation, dated, may, 10, more, directly, stating, that, the, war, was, almost, at, an, end, and, insurgent, cruisers, still, at, sea, and, prepared, to, attack, u, s, ships, should, not, have, rights, to, do, so, through, use, of, safe, foreign, ports, or, waters, britain, finally, responded, on, june, 6, by, transmitting, a, letter, from, foreign, secretary, john, russell, 1st, earl, russell, to, the, lords, of, the, admiralty, withdrawing, rights, to, confederate, warships, to, enter, british, ports, and, waters, u, s, secretary, of, state, seward, welcomed, the, withdrawal, of, concessions, to, the, confederates, finally, on, october, 18, russell, advised, the, admiralty, that, the, time, specified, in, his, june, message, had, elapsed, and, all, measures, of, a, restrictive, nature, on, vessels, of, war, of, the, united, states, in, british, ports, harbors, and, waters, are, now, to, be, considered, as, at, an, end, nonetheless, the, final, confederate, surrender, was, in, liverpool, england, where, james, iredell, waddell, the, captain, of, css, shenandoah, surrendered, the, cruiser, to, british, authorities, on, november, 6, legally, the, war, did, not, end, until, august, 20, 1866, when, president, johnson, issued, a, proclamation, that, declared, that, the, said, insurrection, is, at, an, end, and, that, peace, order, tranquillity, and, civil, authority, now, exist, in, and, throughout, the, whole, of, the, united, states, of, america, the, causes, of, the, war, reasons, for, its, outcome, and, even, its, name, are, subjects, of, lingering, contention, the, north, and, west, grew, rich, while, the, once, rich, south, became, poor, for, a, century, the, national, political, power, of, the, slaveowners, and, rich, southerners, ended, historians, are, less, sure, about, the, results, of, postwar, reconstruction, especially, regarding, the, second, class, citizenship, of, the, freedmen, and, their, poverty, historians, have, debated, whether, the, confederacy, could, have, won, the, war, most, scholars, including, james, m, mcpherson, argue, confederate, victory, was, possible, mcpherson, argues, that, the, north, s, advantage, in, population, and, resources, made, northern, victory, likely, but, not, guaranteed, he, argues, that, if, the, confederacy, had, fought, using, unconventional, tactics, it, would, have, more, easily, been, able, to, hold, out, long, enough, to, exhaust, the, union, confederates, did, not, need, to, invade, and, hold, enemy, territory, to, win, but, only, to, fight, a, defensive, war, to, convince, the, north, the, cost, of, winning, was, too, high, the, north, needed, to, conquer, and, hold, vast, stretches, of, enemy, territory, and, defeat, confederate, armies, to, win, lincoln, was, not, a, military, dictator, and, could, fight, only, as, long, as, the, american, public, supported, it, the, confederacy, sought, to, win, independence, by, outlasting, lincoln, however, after, atlanta, fell, and, lincoln, defeated, mcclellan, in, the, election, of, 1864, hope, for, a, political, victory, for, the, south, ended, lincoln, had, secured, the, support, of, the, republicans, war, democrats, border, states, emancipated, slaves, and, the, neutrality, of, britain, and, france, by, defeating, the, democrats, and, mcclellan, he, defeated, the, copperheads, who, had, wanted, a, negotiated, peace, with, the, confederacy, some, scholars, argue, the, union, held, an, insurmountable, long, term, advantage, over, the, confederacy, in, industrial, strength, and, population, confederate, actions, they, argue, only, delayed, defeat, historian, shelby, foote, expressed, this, view, succinctly, i, think, that, the, north, fought, that, war, with, one, hand, behind, its, back, if, there, had, been, more, southern, victories, and, a, lot, more, the, north, simply, would, have, brought, that, other, hand, out, from, behind, its, back, i, don, t, think, the, south, ever, had, a, chance, to, win, that, war, a, minority, view, among, historians, is, that, the, confederacy, lost, because, as, e, merton, coulter, put, it, people, did, not, will, hard, enough, and, long, enough, to, win, however, most, historians, reject, the, argument, mcpherson, after, reading, thousands, of, letters, written, by, confederate, soldiers, found, strong, patriotism, that, continued, to, the, end, they, truly, believed, they, were, fighting, for, freedom, and, liberty, even, as, the, confederacy, was, visibly, collapsing, in, 1864, 65, most, confederate, soldiers, were, fighting, hard, historian, gary, gallagher, cites, general, sherman, who, in, early, 1864, commented, the, devils, seem, to, have, a, determination, that, cannot, but, be, admired, despite, their, loss, of, slaves, and, wealth, with, starvation, looming, sherman, continued, yet, i, see, no, sign, of, let, up, some, few, deserters, plenty, tired, of, war, but, the, masses, determined, to, fight, it, out, also, important, were, lincoln, s, eloquence, in, rationalizing, the, national, purpose, and, his, skill, in, keeping, the, border, states, committed, to, the, union, cause, the, emancipation, proclamation, was, an, effective, use, of, the, president, s, war, powers, the, confederate, government, failed, to, get, europe, involved, militarily, southern, leaders, needed, to, get, european, powers, to, help, break, the, blockade, the, union, had, created, around, southern, ports, lincoln, s, naval, blockade, was, 95, effective, at, stopping, trade, goods, as, a, result, imports, and, exports, to, the, south, declined, significantly, the, abundance, of, european, cotton, and, britain, s, hostility, to, slavery, along, with, lincoln, s, naval, blockades, severely, decreased, any, chance, that, britain, or, france, would, enter, the, war, historian, don, doyle, has, argued, that, the, union, victory, had, a, major, impact, on, world, history, the, union, victory, energized, popular, democratic, forces, a, confederate, victory, on, the, other, hand, would, have, meant, a, new, birth, of, slavery, not, freedom, historian, fergus, bordewich, following, doyle, argues, that, the, north, s, victory, decisively, proved, the, durability, of, democratic, government, confederate, independence, on, the, other, hand, would, have, established, an, american, model, for, reactionary, politics, and, race, based, repression, that, would, likely, have, cast, an, international, shadow, into, the, 20th, century, and, perhaps, beyond, scholars, have, debated, what, the, effects, of, the, war, were, on, political, and, economic, power, in, the, south, the, prevailing, view, is, that, the, southern, planter, elite, retained, its, powerful, position, in, the, south, however, a, 2017, study, challenges, this, noting, that, while, some, southern, elites, retained, their, economic, status, the, turmoil, of, the, 1860s, created, greater, opportunities, for, economic, mobility, in, the, south, than, in, the, north, the, war, resulted, in, at, least, 1, 030, 000, casualties, 3, percent, of, the, population, including, about, 620, 000, soldier, deaths, two, thirds, by, disease, and, 50, 000, civilians, j, david, hacker, believes, the, number, of, soldier, deaths, was, approximately, 750, 000, 20, percent, higher, than, traditionally, estimated, and, possibly, as, high, as, 850, 000, a, novel, way, of, calculating, casualties, by, looking, at, the, deviation, of, the, death, rate, of, men, of, fighting, age, from, the, norm, through, analysis, of, census, data, found, at, least, 627, 000, and, at, most, 888, 000, people, but, most, likely, 761, 000, people, died, in, the, war, this, would, break, down, to, approximately, 350, 000, confederate, and, 411, 000, union, military, deaths, going, by, the, proportion, of, union, to, confederate, battle, losses, as, mcpherson, notes, the, war, s, cost, in, american, lives, was, as, great, as, in, all, of, the, nation, s, other, wars, combined, through, vietnam, based, on, 1860, census, figures, 8, percent, of, all, white, men, aged, 13, 43, died, in, the, war, including, 6, percent, in, the, north, and, 18, percent, in, the, south, about, 56, 000, soldiers, died, in, prison, camps, during, the, war, an, estimated, 60, 000, soldiers, lost, limbs, of, the, 359, 528, union, army, dead, amounting, to, 15, percent, of, the, over, two, million, who, served, in, addition, there, were, 4, 523, deaths, in, the, navy, 2, 112, in, battle, and, 460, in, the, marines, 148, in, battle, after, the, emancipation, proclamation, authorized, freed, slaves, to, be, received, into, the, armed, service, of, the, united, states, former, slaves, who, escaped, from, plantations, or, were, liberated, by, the, union, army, were, recruited, into, the, united, states, colored, troops, regiments, of, the, union, army, as, were, black, men, who, had, not, been, slaves, the, us, colored, troops, made, up, 10, percent, of, the, union, death, toll, 15, percent, of, union, deaths, from, disease, and, less, than, 3, percent, of, those, killed, in, battle, losses, among, african, americans, were, high, in, the, last, year, and, a, half, and, from, all, reported, casualties, approximately, 20, percent, of, all, african, americans, enrolled, in, the, military, died, during, the, war, their, mortality, rate, was, significantly, higher, than, white, soldiers, while, 15, of, us, volunteers, and, just, 9, of, white, regular, army, troops, died, 21, of, us, colored, troops, died, 16, while, the, figures, of, 360, 000, army, deaths, for, the, union, and, 260, 000, for, the, confederacy, remained, commonly, cited, they, are, incomplete, in, addition, to, many, confederate, records, being, missing, partly, as, a, result, of, confederate, widows, not, reporting, deaths, due, to, being, ineligible, for, benefits, both, armies, only, counted, troops, who, died, during, their, service, and, not, the, tens, of, thousands, who, died, of, wounds, or, diseases, after, being, discharged, this, often, happened, only, days, or, weeks, later, francis, amasa, walker, superintendent, of, the, 1870, census, used, census, and, surgeon, general, data, to, estimate, a, minimum, of, 500, 000, union, military, deaths, and, 350, 000, confederate, military, deaths, a, total, of, 850, 000, soldiers, while, walker, s, estimates, were, originally, dismissed, because, of, the, 1870, census, s, undercounting, it, was, later, found, that, the, census, was, only, off, by, 6, 5, and, that, the, data, walker, used, would, be, roughly, accurate, losses, were, far, higher, than, during, the, war, with, mexico, which, saw, roughly, 13, 000, american, deaths, including, fewer, than, two, thousand, killed, in, battle, between, 1846, 48, one, reason, for, the, high, number, of, battle, deaths, in, the, civil, war, was, the, continued, use, of, tactics, similar, to, those, of, the, napoleonic, wars, such, as, charging, with, the, advent, of, more, accurate, rifled, barrels, mini, balls, and, near, the, end, of, the, war, for, the, union, repeating, firearms, such, as, the, spencer, repeating, rifle, and, the, henry, repeating, rifle, soldiers, were, mowed, down, when, standing, in, lines, in, the, open, this, led, to, the, adoption, of, trench, warfare, a, style, of, fighting, that, defined, much, of, world, war, i, deaths, among, former, slaves, has, proven, hard, to, estimate, due, to, the, lack, of, reliable, census, data, though, they, were, known, to, be, considerable, as, former, slaves, were, set, free, or, escaped, in, massive, numbers, in, areas, where, the, union, army, did, not, have, sufficient, shelter, doctors, or, food, for, them, professor, jim, downs, states, that, tens, of, thousands, to, hundreds, of, thousands, of, slaves, died, during, the, war, from, disease, starvation, or, exposure, and, that, if, these, deaths, are, counted, in, the, war, s, total, the, death, toll, would, exceed, 1, million, it, is, estimated, that, during, the, war, of, the, equines, killed, including, horses, mules, donkeys, and, even, confiscated, children, s, ponies, over, 32, 600, of, them, belonged, to, the, union, and, 45, 800, the, confederacy, however, other, estimates, place, the, total, at, 1, 000, 000, it, is, estimated, that, 544, confederate, flags, were, captured, during, the, war, by, the, union, the, flags, were, sent, to, the, war, department, in, washington, the, union, flags, captured, by, the, confederates, were, sent, to, richmond, abolishing, slavery, was, not, a, union, war, goal, from, the, outset, but, quickly, became, one, lincoln, s, initial, claims, were, that, preserving, the, union, was, the, central, goal, in, contrast, the, south, fought, to, preserve, slavery, while, not, all, southerners, saw, themselves, as, fighting, for, slavery, most, officers, and, over, a, third, of, the, rank, and, file, in, lee, s, army, had, close, family, ties, to, slavery, to, northerners, the, motivation, was, primarily, to, preserve, the, union, not, to, abolish, slavery, however, as, the, war, dragged, on, and, it, became, clear, slavery, was, central, to, the, conflict, and, that, emancipation, was, to, quote, the, emancipation, proclamation, a, fit, and, necessary, war, measure, for, suppressing, rebellion, lincoln, and, his, cabinet, made, ending, slavery, a, war, goal, culminating, in, the, emancipation, proclamation, lincoln, s, decision, to, issue, the, proclamation, angered, peace, democrats, copperheads, and, war, democrats, but, energized, most, republicans, by, warning, that, free, blacks, would, flood, the, north, democrats, made, gains, in, the, 1862, elections, but, they, did, not, gain, control, of, congress, the, republicans, counterargument, that, slavery, was, the, mainstay, of, the, enemy, steadily, gained, support, with, the, democrats, losing, decisively, in, the, 1863, elections, in, the, northern, state, of, ohio, when, they, tried, to, resurrect, anti, black, sentiment, slavery, for, the, confederacy, s, 3, 5, million, blacks, effectively, ended, in, each, area, when, union, armies, arrived, they, were, nearly, all, freed, by, the, proclamation, the, last, confederate, slaves, were, freed, on, june, 19, 1865, celebrated, as, the, modern, holiday, of, juneteenth, slaves, in, the, border, states, and, those, in, some, former, confederate, territory, occupied, before, the, emancipation, proclamation, were, freed, by, state, action, or, on, december, 6, 1865, by, the, thirteenth, amendment, the, emancipation, proclamation, enabled, african, americans, both, free, blacks, and, escaped, slaves, to, join, the, union, army, about, 190, 000, volunteered, further, enhancing, the, numerical, advantage, the, union, armies, enjoyed, over, the, confederates, who, did, not, dare, emulate, the, equivalent, manpower, source, for, fear, of, undermining, the, legitimacy, of, slavery, during, the, war, sentiment, concerning, slaves, enslavement, and, emancipation, in, the, united, states, was, divided, lincoln, s, fears, of, making, slavery, a, war, issue, were, based, on, a, harsh, reality, abolition, did, not, enjoy, wide, support, in, the, west, the, territories, and, the, border, states, in, 1861, lincoln, worried, that, premature, attempts, at, emancipation, would, mean, the, loss, of, the, border, states, and, that, to, lose, kentucky, is, nearly, the, same, as, to, lose, the, whole, game, copperheads, and, some, war, democrats, opposed, emancipation, although, the, latter, eventually, accepted, it, as, part, of, the, total, war, needed, to, save, the, union, at, first, lincoln, reversed, attempts, at, emancipation, by, secretary, of, war, simon, cameron, and, generals, fr, mont, and, david, hunter, to, keep, the, loyalty, of, the, border, states, and, the, war, democrats, lincoln, warned, the, border, states, that, a, more, radical, type, of, emancipation, would, happen, if, his, plan, of, gradual, compensated, emancipation, and, voluntary, colonization, was, rejected, but, compensated, emancipation, occurred, only, in, the, district, of, columbia, where, congress, had, the, power, to, enact, it, when, lincoln, told, his, cabinet, about, his, proposed, emancipation, proclamation, which, would, apply, to, the, states, still, in, rebellion, on, january, 1, 1863, seward, advised, lincoln, to, wait, for, a, union, military, victory, before, issuing, it, as, to, do, otherwise, would, seem, like, our, last, shriek, on, the, retreat, walter, stahr, however, writes, there, are, contemporary, sources, however, that, suggest, others, were, involved, in, the, decision, to, delay, and, stahr, quotes, them, lincoln, laid, the, groundwork, for, public, support, in, an, open, letter, published, in, response, to, horace, greeley, s, the, prayer, of, twenty, millions, the, letter, stated, that, lincoln, s, goal, was, to, save, the, union, and, that, if, he, freed, the, slaves, it, would, be, as, a, means, to, that, end, he, also, had, a, meeting, at, the, white, house, with, five, african, american, representatives, on, august, 14, 1862, arranging, for, a, reporter, to, be, present, he, urged, his, visitors, to, agree, to, the, voluntary, colonization, of, black, people, lincoln, s, motive, for, both, his, letter, to, greeley, and, his, statement, to, the, black, visitors, was, apparently, to, make, his, forthcoming, emancipation, proclamation, more, palatable, to, racist, white, people, a, union, victory, in, the, battle, of, antietam, on, september, 17, 1862, provided, lincoln, with, an, opportunity, to, issue, the, preliminary, emancipation, proclamation, and, the, war, governors, conference, added, support, for, the, proclamation, lincoln, issued, his, preliminary, emancipation, proclamation, on, september, 22, 1862, it, stated, that, slaves, in, all, states, in, rebellion, on, january, 1, 1863, would, be, free, he, issued, his, final, emancipation, proclamation, on, january, 1, 1863, keeping, his, promise, in, his, letter, to, albert, g, hodges, lincoln, explained, his, belief, that, if, slavery, is, not, wrong, nothing, is, wrong, and, yet, i, have, never, understood, that, the, presidency, conferred, upon, me, an, unrestricted, right, to, act, officially, upon, this, judgment, and, feeling, i, claim, not, to, have, controlled, events, but, confess, plainly, that, events, have, controlled, me, lincoln, s, moderate, approach, succeeded, in, inducing, the, border, states, to, remain, in, the, union, and, war, democrats, to, support, the, union, the, border, states, which, included, kentucky, missouri, maryland, delaware, and, union, controlled, regions, around, new, orleans, norfolk, virginia, and, elsewhere, were, not, covered, by, the, emancipation, proclamation, nor, was, tennessee, which, had, come, under, union, control, missouri, and, maryland, abolished, slavery, on, their, own, kentucky, and, delaware, did, not, still, the, proclamation, did, not, enjoy, universal, support, it, caused, much, unrest, in, what, were, then, considered, western, states, where, racist, sentiments, led, to, a, great, fear, of, abolition, there, was, some, concern, that, the, proclamation, would, lead, to, the, secession, of, western, states, and, its, issuance, prompted, the, stationing, of, union, troops, in, illinois, in, case, of, rebellion, since, the, emancipation, proclamation, was, based, on, the, president, s, war, powers, it, applied, only, in, territory, held, by, confederates, at, the, time, it, was, issued, however, the, proclamation, became, a, symbol, of, the, union, s, growing, commitment, to, add, emancipation, to, the, union, s, definition, of, liberty, the, emancipation, proclamation, greatly, reduced, the, confederacy, s, hope, of, being, recognized, or, otherwise, aided, by, britain, or, france, by, late, 1864, lincoln, was, playing, a, leading, role, in, getting, the, house, of, representatives, to, vote, for, the, thirteenth, amendment, which, mandated, the, ending, of, chattel, slavery, the, war, devastated, the, south, and, posed, serious, questions, of, how, it, would, be, reintegrated, into, the, union, the, war, destroyed, much, of, the, south, s, wealth, in, part, because, wealth, held, in, enslaved, people, at, least, 1, 000, each, for, a, healthy, adult, prior, to, the, war, was, wiped, off, the, books, all, accumulated, investment, in, confederate, bonds, was, forfeited, most, banks, and, railroads, were, bankrupt, the, income, per, person, dropped, to, less, than, 40, percent, of, that, of, the, north, and, that, lasted, into, the, 20th, century, southern, influence, in, the, federal, government, previously, considerable, was, greatly, diminished, until, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, reconstruction, began, during, the, war, with, the, emancipation, proclamation, of, january, 1863, and, it, continued, until, 1877, it, comprised, multiple, complex, methods, to, resolve, the, outstanding, issues, of, the, aftermath, the, most, important, of, which, were, the, three, reconstruction, amendments, to, the, constitution, the, 13th, outlawing, slavery, 1865, the, 14th, guaranteeing, citizenship, to, former, slaves, 1868, and, the, 15th, ensuring, voting, rights, to, former, male, slaves, 1870, from, the, union, perspective, the, goals, of, reconstruction, were, to, consolidate, victory, by, reuniting, the, union, to, guarantee, a, republican, form, of, government, for, the, ex, confederate, states, and, to, permanently, end, slavery, and, prevent, semi, slavery, status, president, johnson, who, took, office, in, april, 1865, took, a, lenient, approach, and, saw, the, achievement, of, the, main, war, goals, as, realized, in, 1865, when, each, ex, rebel, state, repudiated, secession, and, ratified, the, thirteenth, amendment, radical, republicans, demanded, proof, that, confederate, nationalism, was, dead, and, that, the, slaves, were, truly, free, they, overrode, johnson, s, vetoes, of, civil, rights, legislation, and, the, house, impeached, him, although, the, senate, did, not, convict, him, in, 1868, and, 1872, the, republican, candidate, grant, won, the, presidency, in, 1872, the, liberal, republicans, argued, that, the, war, goals, had, been, achieved, and, reconstruction, should, end, they, chose, horace, greeley, to, head, a, presidential, ticket, in, 1872, but, were, decisively, defeated, in, 1874, democrats, primarily, southern, took, control, of, congress, and, opposed, further, reconstruction, the, compromise, of, 1877, closed, with, a, national, consensus, except, on, the, part, of, former, slaves, that, the, war, had, finally, ended, with, the, withdrawal, of, federal, troops, however, whites, retook, control, of, every, southern, legislature, and, the, jim, crow, era, of, disenfranchisement, and, legal, segregation, was, ushered, in, the, war, had, a, demonstrable, impact, on, american, politics, many, veterans, on, both, sides, were, elected, to, political, office, including, five, u, s, presidents, ulysses, grant, rutherford, b, hayes, james, garfield, benjamin, harrison, and, william, mckinley, the, war, is, a, central, event, in, american, collective, memory, there, are, innumerable, statues, commemorations, books, and, archival, collections, the, memory, includes, the, home, front, military, affairs, the, treatment, of, soldiers, both, living, and, dead, in, the, war, s, aftermath, depictions, of, the, war, in, literature, and, art, evaluations, of, heroes, and, villains, and, considerations, of, the, moral, and, political, lessons, of, the, war, the, last, theme, includes, moral, evaluations, of, racism, and, slavery, heroism, in, combat, and, behind, the, lines, and, issues, of, democracy, and, minority, rights, as, well, as, the, notion, of, an, empire, of, liberty, influencing, the, world, historians, have, paid, more, attention, to, the, causes, of, the, war, than, to, the, war, itself, military, history, has, largely, developed, outside, academia, leading, to, a, proliferation, of, studies, by, non, scholars, who, nevertheless, are, familiar, with, the, primary, sources, and, pay, close, attention, to, battles, and, campaigns, and, who, write, for, the, general, public, practically, every, major, figure, in, the, war, both, north, and, south, has, had, a, serious, biographical, study, even, the, name, used, for, the, conflict, has, been, controversial, with, many, names, used, for, it, during, and, immediately, after, the, war, northern, historians, often, used, a, term, like, war, of, the, rebellion, writers, in, rebel, states, often, referred, to, the, war, for, southern, independence, some, southerners, have, described, it, as, the, war, of, northern, aggression, the, memory, of, the, war, in, the, white, south, crystallized, in, the, myth, of, the, lost, cause, that, the, confederate, cause, was, just, and, heroic, the, myth, shaped, regional, identity, and, race, relations, for, generations, alan, t, nolan, notes, that, the, lost, cause, was, expressly, a, rationalization, a, cover, up, to, vindicate, the, name, and, fame, of, those, in, rebellion, some, claims, revolve, around, the, insignificance, of, slavery, as, a, cause, some, appeals, highlight, cultural, differences, between, north, and, south, the, military, conflict, by, confederate, actors, is, idealized, in, any, case, secession, was, said, to, be, lawful, nolan, argues, that, the, adoption, of, the, lost, cause, perspective, facilitated, the, reunification, of, the, north, and, the, south, while, excusing, the, virulent, racism, of, the, 19th, century, sacrificing, black, american, progress, to, white, man, s, reunification, he, also, deems, the, lost, cause, a, caricature, of, the, truth, this, caricature, wholly, misrepresents, and, distorts, the, facts, of, the, matter, in, every, instance, the, lost, cause, myth, was, formalized, by, charles, a, beard, and, mary, r, beard, whose, the, rise, of, american, civilization, 1927, spawned, beardian, historiography, the, beards, downplayed, slavery, abolitionism, and, issues, of, morality, though, this, interpretation, was, abandoned, by, the, beards, in, the, 1940s, and, by, historians, generally, by, the, 1950s, beardian, themes, still, echo, among, lost, cause, writers, the, first, efforts, at, civil, war, battlefield, preservation, and, memorialization, came, during, the, war, with, the, establishment, of, national, cemeteries, at,

they, buried, their, dead, following, the, battle, of, stones, river, in, the, 1890s, the, government, established, five, civil, war, battlefield, parks, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, war,
