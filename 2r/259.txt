syllabaries, unique, to, japan, katakana, and, hiragana, emerged, during, this, time, this, gave, rise, to, japan, s, famous, vernacular, literature, with, many, of, its, texts, written, by, court, women, who, were, not, as, educated, in, chinese, as, their, male, counterparts, although, the, imperial, house, of, japan, had, power, on, the, surface, the, real, power, was, in, the, hands, of, the, fujiwara, clan, a, powerful, aristocratic, family, who, had, intermarried, with, the, imperial, family, many, emperors, had, mothers, from, the, fujiwara, family, the, economy, mostly, existed, through, barter, and, trade, while, the, sh, en, system, enabled, the, accumulation, of, wealth, by, an, aristocratic, elite, even, though, the, heian, period, was, one, of, national, peace, the, government, failed, to, effectively, police, the, territory, leading, to, frequent, robberies, of, travellers, the, heian, period, was, preceded, by, the, nara, period, and, began, in, 794, ad, after,

political, situation, unstable, the, japanese, missions, to, tang, china, were, suspended, and, the, influx, of, chinese, exports, halted, a, fact, which, facilitated, the, independent, growth, of, japanese, culture, called, kokufu, bunka, therefore, the, heian, period, is, considered, a, high, point, in, japanese, culture, that, later, generations, have, always, admired, the, period, is, also, noted, for, the, rise, of, the, samurai, class, which, would, eventually, take, power, and, start, the, feudal, period, of, japan, nominally, sovereignty, lay, in, the, emperor, but, in, fact, power, was, wielded, by, the, fujiwara, nobility, however, to, protect, their, interests, in, the, provinces, the, fujiwara, and, other, noble, families, required, guards, police, and, soldiers, the, warrior, class, made, steady, political, gains, throughout, the, heian, period, as, early, as, 939, ad, taira, no, masakado, threatened, the, authority, of, the, central, government, leading, an, uprising, in, the, eastern, province, of, hitachi, and, almost, simultaneously, fujiwara, no, sumitomo, rebelled, in, the, west, still, a, true, military, takeover, of, the, japanese, government, was, centuries, away, when, much, of, the, strength, of, the, government, would, lie, within, the, private, armies, of, the, shogunate, the, entry, of, the, warrior, class, into, court, influence, was, a, result, of, the, h, gen, rebellion, at, this, time, taira, no, kiyomori, revived, the, fujiwara, practices, by, placing, his, grandson, on, the, throne, to, rule, japan, by, regency, their, clan, the, taira, would, not, be, overthrown, until, after, the, genpei, war, which, marked, the, start, of, the, kamakura, shogunate, the, kamakura, period, began, in, 1185, when, minamoto, no, yoritomo, seized, power, from, the, emperors, and, established, the, shogunate, in, kamakura, when, emperor, kammu, moved, the, capital, to, heian, ky, kyoto, which, remained, the, imperial, capital, for, the, next, 1, 000, years, he, did, so, not, only, to, strengthen, imperial, authority, but, also, to, improve, his, seat, of, government, geopolitically, nara, was, abandoned, after, only, 70, years, in, part, due, to, the, ascendancy, of, d, ky, and, the, encroaching, secular, power, of, the, buddhist, institutions, there, kyoto, had, good, river, access, to, the, sea, and, could, be, reached, by, land, routes, from, the, eastern, provinces, the, early, heian, period, 784, 967, continued, nara, culture, the, heian, capital, was, patterned, on, the, chinese, tang, capital, at, chang, an, as, was, nara, but, on, a, larger, scale, than, nara, kammu, endeavored, to, improve, the, tang, style, administrative, system, which, was, in, use, known, as, the, ritsury, code, this, system, attempted, to, recreate, the, tang, legal, system, in, japan, despite, the, tremendous, differences, in, the, levels, of, development, between, the, two, countries, despite, the, decline, of, the, taika, taih, reforms, the, imperial, government, was, vigorous, during, the, early, heian, period, kammu, s, avoidance, of, drastic, reform, decreased, the, intensity, of, political, struggles, and, he, became, recognized, as, one, of, japan, s, most, forceful, emperors, although, kammu, had, abandoned, universal, conscription, in, 792, he, still, waged, major, military, offensives, to, subjugate, the, emishi, possible, descendants, of, the, displaced, j, mon, living, in, northern, and, eastern, japan, after, making, temporary, gains, in, 794, in, 797, kammu, appointed, a, new, commander, sakanoue, no, tamuramaro, under, the, title, seii, taish, gun, barbarian, subduing, generalissimo, by, 801, the, sh, gun, had, defeated, the, emishi, and, had, extended, the, imperial, domains, to, the, eastern, end, of, honsh, imperial, control, over, the, provinces, was, tenuous, at, best, however, in, the, ninth, and, tenth, centuries, much, authority, was, lost, to, the, great, families, who, disregarded, the, chinese, style, land, and, tax, systems, imposed, by, the, government, in, kyoto, stability, came, to, japan, but, even, though, succession, was, ensured, for, the, imperial, family, through, heredity, power, again, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, one, noble, family, the, fujiwara, following, kammu, s, death, in, 806, and, a, succession, struggle, among, his, sons, two, new, offices, were, established, in, an, effort, to, adjust, the, taika, taih, administrative, structure, through, the, new, emperor, s, private, office, the, emperor, could, issue, administrative, edicts, more, directly, and, with, more, self, assurance, than, before, the, new, metropolitan, police, board, replaced, the, largely, ceremonial, imperial, guard, units, while, these, two, offices, strengthened, the, emperor, s, position, temporarily, soon, they, and, other, chinese, style, structures, were, bypassed, in, the, developing, state, in, 838, the, end, of, the, imperial, sanctioned, missions, to, tang, china, which, had, begun, in, 630, marked, the, effective, end, of, chinese, influence, tang, china, was, in, a, state, of, decline, and, chinese, buddhists, were, severely, persecuted, undermining, japanese, respect, for, chinese, institutions, japan, began, to, turn, inward, as, the, soga, clan, had, taken, control, of, the, throne, in, the, sixth, century, the, fujiwara, by, the, ninth, century, had, intermarried, with, the, imperial, family, and, one, of, their, members, was, the, first, head, of, the, emperor, s, private, office, another, fujiwara, became, regent, sessh, for, his, grandson, then, a, minor, emperor, and, yet, another, was, appointed, kampaku, toward, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, several, emperors, tried, but, failed, to, check, the, fujiwara, for, a, time, however, during, the, reign, of, emperor, daigo, 897, 930, the, fujiwara, regency, was, suspended, as, he, ruled, directly, nevertheless, the, fujiwara, were, not, demoted, by, daigo, but, actually, became, stronger, during, his, reign, central, control, of, japan, had, continued, to, decline, and, the, fujiwara, along, with, other, great, families, and, religious, foundations, acquired, ever, larger, sh, en, and, greater, wealth, during, the, early, tenth, century, by, the, early, heian, period, the, sh, en, had, obtained, legal, status, and, the, large, religious, establishments, sought, clear, titles, in, perpetuity, waiver, of, taxes, and, immunity, from, government, inspection, of, the, sh, en, they, held, those, people, who, worked, the, land,

facto, return, to, conditions, before, the, taika, reform, within, decades, of, daigo, s, death, the, fujiwara, had, absolute, control, over, the, court, by, the, year, 1000, fujiwara, no, michinaga, was, able, to, enthrone, and, dethrone, emperors, at, will, little, authority, was, left, for, traditional, institutions, and, government, affairs, were, handled, through, the, fujiwara, clan, s, private, administration, the, fujiwara, had, become, what, historian, george, b, sansom, has, called, hereditary, dictators, despite, their, usurpation, of, imperial, authority, the, fujiwara, presided, over, a, period, of, cultural, and, artistic, flowering, at, the, imperial, court, and, among, the, aristocracy, there, was, great, interest, in, graceful, poetry, and, vernacular, literature, two, types, of, phonetic, japanese, script, katakana, a, simplified, script, that, was, developed, by, using, parts, of, chinese, characters, was, abbreviated, to, hiragana, a, cursive, syllabary, with, a, distinct, writing, method, that, was, uniquely, japanese, hiragana, gave, written, expression, to, the, spoken, word, and, with, it, to, the, rise, in, japan, s, famous, vernacular, literature, much, of, it, written, by, court, women, who, had, not, been, trained, in, chinese, as, had, their, male, counterparts, three, late, tenth, century, and, early, 11th, century, women, presented, their, views, of, life, and, romance, at, the, heian, court, in, kager, nikki, by, the, mother, of, fujiwara, michitsuna, the, pillow, book, by, sei, sh, nagon, and, the, tale, of, genji, by, murasaki, shikibu, indigenous, art, also, flourished, under, the, fujiwara, after, centuries, of, imitating, chinese, forms, vividly, colored, yamato, e, japanese, style, paintings, of, court, life, and, stories, about, temples, and, shrines, became, common, in, the, mid, to, late, heian, period, setting, patterns, for, japanese, art, to, this, day, as, culture, flourished, so, did, decentralization, whereas, the, first, phase, of, sh, en, development, in, the, early, heian, period, had, seen, the, opening, of, new, lands, and, the, granting, of, the, use, of, lands, to, aristocrats, and, religious, institutions, the, second, phase, saw, the, growth, of, patrimonial, house, governments, as, in, the, old, clan, system, in, fact, the, form, of, the, old, clan, system, had, remained, largely, intact, within, the, great, old, centralized, government, new, institutions, were, now, needed, in, the, face, of, social, economic, and, political, changes, the, taih, code, lapsed, its, institutions, relegated, to, ceremonial, functions, family, administrations, now, became, public, institutions, as, the, most, powerful, family, the, fujiwara, governed, japan, and, determined, the, general, affairs, of, state, such, as, succession, to, the, throne, family, and, state, affairs, were, thoroughly, intermixed, a, pattern, followed, among, other, families, monasteries, and, even, the, imperial, family, land, management, became, the, primary, occupation, of, the, aristocracy, not, so, much, because, direct, control, by, the, imperial, family, or, central, government, had, declined, but, more, from, strong, family, solidarity, and, a, lack, of, a, sense, of, japan, as, a, single, nation, under, the, early, courts, when, military, conscription, had, been, centrally, controlled, military, affairs, had, been, taken, out, of, the, hands, of, the, provincial, aristocracy, but, as, the, system, broke, down, after, 792, local, power, holders, again, became, the, primary, source, of, military, strength, the, re, establishment, of, an, efficient, military, system, was, made, gradually, through, a, process, of, trial, and, error, at, that, time, the, imperial, court, did, not, possess, an, army, but, rather, relied, on, an, organization, of, professional, warriors, composed, mainly, of, oryoshi, which, were, appointed, to, an, individual, province, and, tsuibushi, which, were, appointed, over, imperial, circuits, or, for, specific, tasks, this, gave, rise, to, the, japanese, military, class, nonetheless, final, authority, rested, with, the, imperial, court, sh, en, holders, had, access, to, manpower, and, as, they, obtained, improved, military, technology, such, as, new, training, methods, more, powerful, bows, armor, horses, and, superior, swords, and, faced, worsening, local, conditions, in, the, ninth, century, military, service, became, part, of, sh, en, life, not, only, the, sh, en, but, also, civil, and, religious, institutions, formed, private, guard, units, to, protect, themselves, gradually, the, provincial, upper, class, was, transformed, into, a, new, military, elite, of, samurai, bushi, interests, were, diverse, cutting, across, old, power, structures, to, form, new, associations, in, the, tenth, century, mutual, interests, family, connections, and, kinship, were, consolidated, in, military, groups, that, became, part, of, family, administration, in, time, large, regional, military, families, formed, around, members, of, the, court, aristocracy, who, had, become, prominent, provincial, figures, these, military, families, gained, prestige, from, connections, to, the, imperial, court, and, court, granted, military, titles, and, access, to, manpower, the, fujiwara, family, taira, clan, and, minamoto, clan, were, among, the, most, prominent, families, supported, by, the, new, military, class, a, decline, in, food, production, the, growth, of, the, population, and, competition, for, resources, among, the, great, families, all, led, to, the, gradual, decline, of, fujiwara, power, and, gave, rise, to, military, disturbances, in, the, mid, tenth, and, eleventh, centuries, members, of, the, fujiwara, taira, and, minamoto, families, all, of, whom, had, descended, from, the, imperial, family, attacked, one, another, claimed, control, over, vast, tracts, of, conquered, land, set, up, rival, regimes, and, generally, upset, the, peace, the, fujiwara, controlled, the, throne, until, the, reign, of, emperor, go, sanj, 1068, 1073, the, first, emperor, not, born, of, a, fujiwara, mother, since, the, ninth, century, go, sanjo, determined, to, restore, imperial, control, through, strong, personal, rule, implemented, reforms, to, curb, fujiwara, influence, he, also, established, an, office, to, compile, and, validate, estate, records, with, the, aim, of, reasserting, central, control, many, sh, en, were, not, properly, certified, and, large, landholders, like, the, fujiwara, felt, threatened, with, the, loss, of, their, lands, go, sanjo, also, established, the, in, no, ch, office, of, the, cloistered, emperor, which, was, held, by, a, succession, of, emperors, who, abdicated, to, devote, themselves, to, behind, the, scenes, governance, or, insei, the, in, no, ch, filled, the, void, left, by, the, decline, of, fujiwara, power, rather, than, being, banished, the, fujiwara, were, mostly, retained, in, their, old, positions, of, civil, dictator, and, minister, of, the, center, while, being, bypassed, in, decision, making, in, time, many, of, the, fujiwara, were, replaced, mostly, by, members, of, the, rising, minamoto, clan, while, the, fujiwara, fell, into, disputes, among, themselves, and, formed, northern, and, southern, factions, the, insei, system, allowed, the, paternal, line, of, the, imperial, family, to, gain, influence, over, the, throne, the, period, from, 1086, to, 1156, was, the, age, of, supremacy, of, the, in, no, ch, and, of, the, rise, of, the, military, class, throughout, the, country, military, might, rather, than, civil, authority, dominated, the, government, a, struggle, for,
