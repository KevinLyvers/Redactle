https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race
the, space, race, russian, was, a, 20th, century, competition, between, two, cold, war, rivals, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, to, achieve, superior, spaceflight, capability, it, had, its, origins, in, the, ballistic, missile, based, nuclear, arms, race, between, the, two, nations, following, world, war, ii, and, had, its, peak, with, the, more, particular, moon, race, to, land, on, the, moon, between, the, us, moonshot, and, soviet, moonshot, programs, the, technological, advantage, demonstrated, by, spaceflight, achievement, was, seen, as, necessary, for, national, security, and, became, part, of, the, symbolism, and, ideology, of, the, time, the, space, race, brought, pioneering, launches, of, artificial, satellites, robotic, space, probes, to, the, moon, venus, and, mars, and, human, spaceflight, in, low, earth, orbit, and, ultimately, to, the, moon, public, interest, in, space, travel, originated, in, the, 1951, publication, of, a, soviet, youth, magazine, and, was, promptly, picked, up, by, us, magazines, the, competition, began, on, july, 30, 1955, when, the, united, states, announced, its, intent, to, launch, artificial, satellites, for, the, international, geophysical, year, four, days, later, the, soviet, union, responded, by, declaring, they, would, also, launch, a, satellite, in, the, near, future, the, launching, of, satellites, was, enabled, by, developments, in, ballistic, missile, capabilities, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, competition, gained, western, public, attention, with, the, sputnik, crisis, when, the, ussr, achieved, the, first, successful, satellite, launch, sputnik, 1, on, october, 4, 1957, it, gained, momentum, when, the, ussr, sent, the, first, human, yuri, gagarin, into, space, with, the, orbital, flight, of, vostok, 1, on, april, 12, 1961, these, were, followed, by, a, string, of, other, early, firsts, achieved, by, the, soviets, over, the, next, few, years, gagarin, s, flight, led, us, president, john, f, kennedy, to, raise, the, stakes, on, may, 25, 1961, by, asking, the, us, congress, to, commit, to, the, goal, of, landing, a, man, on, the, moon, and, returning, him, safely, to, the, earth, before, the, end, of, the, decade, both, countries, began, developing, super, heavy, lift, launch, vehicles, with, the, us, successfully, deploying, the, saturn, v, which, was, large, enough, to, send, a, three, person, orbiter, and, two, person, lander, to, the, moon, kennedy, s, moon, landing, goal, was, achieved, in, july, 1969, with, the, flight, of, apollo, 11, the, conclusion, of, apollo, 11, is, regarded, by, many, as, ending, the, space, race, with, an, american, victory, this, view, is, contested, by, some, historians, whilst, space, historian, asif, a, siddiqi, proposed, a, more, balanced, view, the, ussr, continued, to, pursue, crewed, lunar, programs, to, launch, and, land, on, the, moon, before, the, us, with, its, n1, rocket, but, did, not, succeed, and, eventually, canceled, it, to, concentrate, on, salyut, the, first, space, station, program, and, the, first, landings, on, venus, and, on, mars, meanwhile, the, us, landed, five, more, apollo, crews, on, the, moon, and, continued, exploration, of, other, extraterrestrial, bodies, robotically, a, period, of, d, tente, followed, with, the, april, 1972, agreement, on, a, cooperative, apollo, soyuz, test, project, astp, resulting, in, the, july, 1975, rendezvous, in, earth, orbit, of, a, us, astronaut, crew, with, a, soviet, cosmonaut, crew, and, joint, development, of, an, international, docking, standard, apas, 75, being, considered, as, the, final, act, of, the, space, race, the, competition, was, only, gradually, replaced, with, cooperation, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, eventually, allowed, the, us, and, the, newly, founded, russian, federation, to, end, their, cold, war, competition, also, in, space, by, agreeing, in, 1993, on, the, shuttle, mir, and, international, space, station, programs, although, germans, americans, and, soviets, experimented, with, small, liquid, fuel, rockets, before, world, war, ii, launching, satellites, and, humans, into, space, required, the, development, of, larger, ballistic, missiles, such, as, wernher, von, braun, s, aggregat, 4, a, 4, which, became, known, as, the, vergeltungswaffe, 2, v, 2, developed, by, nazi, germany, to, bomb, the, allies, in, the, war, after, the, war, both, the, us, and, ussr, acquired, custody, of, german, rocket, development, assets, which, they, used, to, leverage, the, development, of, their, own, missiles, public, interest, in, space, flight, was, first, aroused, in, october, 1951, when, the, soviet, rocketry, engineer, mikhail, tikhonravov, published, flight, to, the, moon, in, the, newspaper, pionerskaya, pravda, for, young, readers, he, described, a, two, person, interplanetary, spaceship, of, the, future, and, the, industrial, and, technological, processes, required, to, create, it, he, ended, the, short, article, with, a, clear, forecast, of, the, future, we, do, not, have, long, to, wait, we, can, assume, that, the, bold, dream, of, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, will, be, realized, within, the, next, 10, to, 15, years, from, march, 1952, to, april, 1954, the, us, collier, s, magazine, reacted, with, a, series, of, seven, articles, man, will, conquer, space, soon, detailing, wernher, von, braun, s, plans, for, crewed, spaceflight, in, march, 1955, disneyland, s, animated, episode, man, in, space, in, the, us, television, with, an, audience, of, about, 40, million, people, eventually, fired, the, public, enthusiasm, for, space, travel, and, raised, government, interest, both, in, the, us, and, ussr, soon, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, two, former, allies, became, engaged, in, a, state, of, political, conflict, and, military, tension, known, as, the, cold, war, 1947, 1991, which, polarized, europe, between, the, soviet, union, s, satellite, states, often, referred, to, as, the, eastern, bloc, and, the, states, of, the, western, world, allied, with, the, u, s, the, first, soviet, development, of, artillery, rockets, was, in, 1921, when, the, soviet, military, sanctioned, the, gas, dynamics, laboratory, a, small, research, laboratory, to, explore, solid, fuel, rockets, led, by, nikolai, tikhomirov, who, had, begun, studying, solid, and, liquid, fueled, rockets, in, 1894, and, obtained, a, patent, in, 1915, for, self, propelled, aerial, and, water, surface, mines, the, first, test, firing, of, a, solid, fuel, rocket, was, carried, out, in, 1928, further, development, was, carried, out, in, the, 1930s, by, the, group, for, the, study, of, reactive, motion, gird, where, soviet, rocket, pioneers, sergey, korolev, friedrich, zander, mikhail, tikhonravov, and, leonid, dushkin, launched, gird, x, the, first, soviet, liquid, fueled, rocket, in, 1933, in, 1933, the, two, design, bureaus, were, combined, into, the, reactive, scientific, research, institute, and, produced, the, rp, 318, the, ussr, s, first, rocket, powered, aircraft, and, the, rs, 82, and, rs, 132, missiles, which, became, the, basis, for, the, katyusha, multiple, rocket, launcher, during, the, 1930s, soviet, rocket, technology, was, comparable, to, germany, s, but, joseph, stalin, s, great, purge, from, 1936, to, 1938, severely, damaged, its, progress, in, 1945, the, soviets, captured, several, key, nazi, german, a, 4, v, 2, rocket, production, facilities, and, also, gained, the, services, of, some, german, scientists, and, engineers, related, to, the, project, a, 4s, were, assembled, and, studied, and, the, experience, derived, from, assembling, and, launching, a4, rockets, was, directly, applied, to, the, soviet, copy, called, the, r, 1, with, nii, 88, chief, designer, sergei, korolev, overseeing, the, r, 1, s, development, the, r, 1, entered, into, service, in, the, soviet, army, on, 28, november, 1950, by, the, latter, half, of, 1946, korolev, and, rocket, engineer, valentin, glushko, had, with, extensive, input, from, german, engineers, outlined, a, successor, to, the, r, 1, the, r, 2, with, an, extended, frame, and, a, new, engine, designed, by, glushko, which, entered, service, in, november, 1951, with, a, range, of, 600, kilometres, 370, mi, twice, that, of, the, r, 1, this, was, followed, in, 1951, with, the, development, of, the, r, 5, pobeda, the, soviet, union, s, first, real, strategic, missile, with, a, range, of, 1, 200, km, 750, mi, and, capable, of, carrying, a, 1, megaton, mt, thermonuclear, warhead, the, r, 5, entered, service, in, 1955, scientific, versions, of, the, r, 1, r, 2, and, r, 5, undertook, various, experiments, between, 1949, and, 1958, including, flights, with, space, dogs, 21, 23, design, work, began, in, 1953, on, the, r, 7, semyorka, with, the, requirement, for, a, missile, with, a, launch, mass, of, 170, to, 200, tons, range, of, 8, 500, km, and, carrying, a, 3, 000, kg, 6, 600, lb, nuclear, warhead, powerful, enough, to, launch, a, nuclear, warhead, against, the, united, states, in, late, 1953, the, warhead, s, mass, was, increased, to, 5, 5, to, 6, tons, to, accommodate, the, then, planned, theromonuclear, bomb, on, the, 21, august, 1957, the, r, 7, flew, 6, 000, km, 3, 700, mi, and, became, the, worlds, s, first, intercontinental, ballistic, missile, two, months, later, the, r, 7, launched, sputnik, 1, the, first, artificial, satellite, into, orbit, and, became, the, basis, for, the, r, 7, family, which, includes, sputnik, luna, molniya, vostok, and, voskhod, space, launchers, as, well, as, later, soyuz, variants, several, versions, are, still, in, use, and, it, has, become, the, world, s, most, reliable, space, launcher, although, american, rocket, pioneer, robert, h, goddard, developed, patented, and, flew, small, liquid, propellant, rockets, as, early, as, 1914, he, became, a, recluse, when, his, ideas, were, ridiculed, by, an, editorial, in, the, new, york, times, this, left, the, united, states, as, the, only, one, of, the, major, three, world, war, ii, powers, not, to, have, its, own, rocket, program, until, von, braun, and, his, engineers, were, expatriated, from, nazi, germany, in, 1945, the, us, acquired, a, large, number, of, v, 2, rockets, and, recruited, von, braun, and, most, of, his, engineering, team, in, operation, paperclip, the, team, was, sent, to, the, army, s, white, sands, proving, ground, in, new, mexico, in, 1945, they, set, about, assembling, the, captured, v, 2s, and, began, a, program, of, launching, them, and, instructing, american, engineers, in, their, operation, these, tests, led, to, the, first, photos, of, earth, from, space, and, the, first, two, stage, rocket, the, wac, corporal, v, 2, combination, in, 1949, the, german, rocket, team, was, moved, from, fort, bliss, to, the, army, s, new, redstone, arsenal, located, in, huntsville, alabama, in, 1950, from, here, von, braun, and, his, team, developed, the, army, s, first, operational, medium, range, ballistic, missile, the, redstone, rocket, derivatives, of, which, launched, both, america, s, first, satellite, and, the, first, piloted, mercury, space, missions, it, became, the, basis, for, both, the, jupiter, and, saturn, family, of, rockets, each, of, the, united, states, armed, services, had, its, own, icbm, development, program, the, air, force, began, icbm, research, in, 1945, with, the, mx, 774, in, 1950, von, braun, began, testing, the, air, force, pgm, 11, redstone, rocket, family, at, cape, canaveral, by, 1957, a, descendant, of, the, air, force, mx, 774, received, top, priority, funding, and, evolved, into, the, atlas, a, the, first, successful, american, icbm, its, upgraded, version, the, atlas, d, later, served, as, a, nuclear, icbm, and, as, the, orbital, launch, vehicle, for, project, mercury, and, the, remote, controlled, agena, target, vehicle, used, in, project, gemini, in, 1955, with, both, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, building, ballistic, missiles, that, could, be, used, to, launch, objects, into, space, the, stage, was, set, for, nationalistic, competition, on, july, 29, 1955, james, c, hagerty, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, s, press, secretary, announced, that, the, united, states, intended, to, launch, small, earth, circling, satellites, between, july, 1, 1957, and, december, 31, 1958, as, part, of, the, us, contribution, to, the, international, geophysical, year, igy, on, august, 2, at, the, sixth, congress, of, the, international, astronautical, federation, in, copenhagen, scientist, leonid, i, sedov, told, international, reporters, at, the, soviet, embassy, of, his, country, s, intention, to, launch, a, satellite, as, well, in, the, near, future, on, august, 30, 1955, korolev, managed, to, get, the, soviet, academy, of, sciences, to, create, a, commission, whose, purpose, was, to, beat, the, americans, into, earth, orbit, this, was, the, de, facto, start, date, for, the, space, race, the, council, of, ministers, of, the, soviet, union, began, a, policy, of, treating, development, of, its, space, program, as, top, secret, when, the, sputnik, project, was, first, approved, one, of, the, immediate, courses, of, action, the, politburo, took, was, to, consider, what, to, announce, to, the, world, regarding, their, event, the, telegraph, agency, of, the, soviet, union, tass, established, precedents, for, all, official, announcements, on, the, soviet, space, program, the, information, eventually, released, did, not, offer, details, on, who, built, and, launched, the, satellite, or, why, it, was, launched, however, the, public, release, is, illuminating, in, what, it, does, reveal, there, is, an, abundance, of, arcane, scientific, and, technical, data, as, if, to, overwhelm, the, reader, with, mathematics, in, the, absence, of, even, a, picture, of, the, object, the, soviet, space, program, s, use, of, secrecy, served, as, both, a, tool, to, prevent, the, leaking, of, classified, information, between, countries, and, also, to, create, a, mysterious, barrier, between, the, space, program, and, the, soviet, populace, the, program, s, nature, embodied, ambiguous, messages, concerning, its, goals, successes, and, values, the, program, itself, was, so, secret, that, a, regular, soviet, citizen, could, never, achieve, a, concrete, image, of, it, but, rather, a, superficial, picture, of, its, history, present, activities, or, future, endeavors, launchings, were, not, announced, until, they, took, place, cosmonaut, names, were, not, released, until, they, flew, mission, details, were, sparse, outside, observers, did, not, know, the, size, or, shape, of, their, rockets, or, cabins, or, most, of, their, spaceships, except, for, the, first, sputniks, lunar, probes, and, venus, probe, the, soviet, military, maintained, control, over, the, space, program, korolev, s, okb, 1, design, bureau, was, subordinated, under, the, ministry, of, general, machine, building, tasked, with, the, development, of, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, and, continued, to, give, its, assets, random, identifiers, into, the, 1960s, they, cloaked, the, program, in, a, shroud, of, secrecy, public, pronouncements, were, uniformly, positive, as, far, as, the, public, knew, the, soviet, space, program, had, never, experienced, failure, according, to, historian, james, andrews, with, almost, no, exceptions, coverage, of, soviet, space, exploits, especially, in, the, case, of, human, space, missions, omitted, reports, of, failure, or, trouble, dominic, phelan, says, in, the, book, cold, war, space, sleuths, springer, praxis, 2013, the, ussr, was, famously, described, by, winston, churchill, as, a, riddle, wrapped, in, a, mystery, inside, an, enigma, and, nothing, signified, this, more, than, the, search, for, the, truth, behind, its, space, program, during, the, cold, war, although, the, space, race, was, literally, played, out, above, our, heads, it, was, often, obscured, by, a, figurative, space, curtain, that, took, much, effort, to, see, through, initially, president, eisenhower, was, worried, that, a, satellite, passing, above, a, nation, at, over, 100, kilometers, 62, mi, might, be, seen, as, violating, that, nation, s, airspace, he, was, concerned, that, the, soviet, union, would, accuse, the, americans, of, an, illegal, overflight, thereby, scoring, a, propaganda, victory, at, his, expense, eisenhower, and, his, advisors, were, of, the, opinion, that, a, nation, s, airspace, sovereignty, did, not, extend, past, the, k, rm, n, line, and, they, used, the, 1957, 58, international, geophysical, year, launches, to, establish, this, principle, in, international, law, eisenhower, also, feared, that, he, might, cause, an, international, incident, and, be, called, a, warmonger, if, he, were, to, use, military, missiles, as, launchers, therefore, he, selected, the, untried, naval, research, laboratory, s, vanguard, rocket, which, was, a, research, only, rocket, this, meant, that, von, braun, s, team, was, not, allowed, to, put, a, satellite, into, orbit, with, their, jupiter, c, rocket, because, of, its, intended, use, as, a, future, military, vehicle, on, september, 20, 1956, von, braun, and, his, team, did, launch, a, jupiter, c, that, was, capable, of, putting, a, satellite, into, orbit, but, the, launch, was, used, only, as, a, suborbital, test, of, reentry, vehicle, technology, korolev, received, word, about, von, braun, s, 1956, jupiter, c, test, and, mistakenly, thinking, it, was, a, satellite, mission, that, failed, expedited, plans, to, get, his, own, satellite, in, orbit, since, the, r, 7, was, substantially, more, powerful, than, any, of, the, us, launch, vehicles, he, made, sure, to, take, full, advantage, of, this, capability, by, designing, object, d, as, his, primary, satellite, it, was, given, the, designation, d, to, distinguish, it, from, other, r, 7, payload, designations, a, b, v, and, g, which, were, nuclear, weapon, payloads, object, d, dwarfed, the, proposed, us, satellites, having, a, weight, of, 1, 400, kilograms, 3, 100, lb, of, which, 300, kilograms, 660, lb, would, be, composed, of, scientific, instruments, that, would, photograph, the, earth, take, readings, on, radiation, levels, and, check, on, the, planet, s, magnetic, field, however, things, were, not, going, along, well, with, the, design, and, manufacturing, of, the, satellite, so, in, february, 1957, korolev, sought, and, received, permission, from, the, council, of, ministers, to, build, a, prosteishy, sputnik, ps, 1, or, simple, satellite, the, council, also, decreed, that, object, d, be, postponed, until, april, 1958, the, new, sputnik, was, a, metallic, sphere, that, would, be, a, much, lighter, craft, weighing, 83, 8, kilograms, 185, lb, and, having, a, 58, centimeter, 23, in, diameter, the, satellite, would, not, contain, the, complex, instrumentation, that, object, d, had, but, had, two, radio, transmitters, operating, on, different, short, wave, radio, frequencies, the, ability, to, detect, if, a, meteoroid, were, to, penetrate, its, pressure, hull, and, the, ability, to, detect, the, density, of, the, earth, s, thermosphere, korolev, was, buoyed, by, the, first, successful, launches, of, the, r, 7, rocket, in, august, and, september, which, paved, the, way, for, the, launch, of, sputnik, word, came, that, the, us, was, planning, to, announce, a, major, breakthrough, at, an, international, geophysical, year, conference, at, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, washington, d, c, with, a, paper, titled, satellite, over, the, planet, on, october, 6, 1957, korolev, anticipated, that, von, braun, might, launch, a, jupiter, c, with, a, satellite, payload, on, or, around, october, 4, or, 5, in, conjunction, with, the, paper, he, hastened, the, launch, moving, it, to, october, 4, the, launch, vehicle, for, ps, 1, was, a, modified, r, 7, vehicle, 8k71ps, number, m1, ps, without, much, of, the, test, equipment, and, radio, gear, that, was, present, in, the, previous, launches, it, arrived, at, the, soviet, missile, base, tyura, tam, in, september, and, was, prepared, for, its, mission, at, launch, site, number, one, the, first, launch, took, place, on, friday, october, 4, 1957, at, exactly, 10, 28, 34, pm, moscow, time, with, the, r, 7, and, the, now, named, sputnik, 1, satellite, lifting, off, the, launch, pad, and, placing, the, artificial, moon, into, an, orbit, a, few, minutes, later, this, fellow, traveler, as, the, name, is, translated, in, english, was, a, small, beeping, ball, less, than, two, feet, in, diameter, and, weighing, less, than, 200, pounds, but, the, celebrations, were, muted, at, the, launch, control, center, until, the, down, range, far, east, tracking, station, at, kamchatka, received, the, first, distinctive, beep, beep, beep, sounds, from, sputnik, 1, s, radio, transmitters, indicating, that, it, was, on, its, way, to, completing, its, first, orbit, about, 95, minutes, after, launch, the, satellite, flew, over, its, launch, site, and, its, radio, signals, were, picked, up, by, the, engineers, and, military, personnel, at, tyura, tam, that, s, when, korolev, and, his, team, celebrated, the, first, successful, artificial, satellite, placed, into, earth, orbit, at, the, latest, the, successful, start, of, sputnik, 2, with, its, weight, of, more, than, 500, kg, proved, that, the, ussr, had, achieved, a, leading, advantage, in, rocket, technology, the, dumbfounded, cia, estimated, the, launch, weight, at, 500, metric, tons, requiring, an, initial, thrust, of, more, than, 1, 000, tons, and, supposed, the, use, of, a, three, stage, rocket, in, a, secret, report, it, concluded, that, the, launching, of, two, earth, satellites, must, have, been, a, stupendous, scientific, achievement, launching, of, these, satellites, does, indicate, however, that, the, ussr, has, perfected, an, icbm, which, they, can, put, on, any, desired, target, with, accuracy, in, reality, the, launch, weight, of, the, soviet, rocket, was, 267, metric, tons, with, an, initial, thrust, of, 410, tons, with, one, and, a, half, stages, the, cia, s, misjudgement, was, caused, by, extrapolating, the, parameters, of, the, us, atlas, rocket, developed, at, the, same, time, launch, weight, 82, tons, initial, thrust, 135, tones, maximum, payload, of, 70, kg, for, low, earth, orbit, in, part, the, favourable, data, of, the, soviet, launcher, was, based, on, concepts, proposed, by, the, german, rocket, scientists, headed, by, helmut, gr, ttrup, on, gorodomlya, island, such, as, among, other, things, the, rigorous, weight, saving, the, control, of, the, residual, fuel, quantities, and, a, reduced, thrust, to, weight, relation, of, 1, 4, instead, of, usual, factor, 2, the, cia, had, heard, about, such, details, already, in, january, 1954, when, it, interrogated, g, ttrup, after, his, return, from, the, ussr, but, did, not, take, him, seriously, the, soviet, success, raised, a, great, deal, of, concern, in, the, united, states, for, example, economist, bernard, baruch, wrote, in, an, open, letter, titled, the, lessons, of, defeat, to, the, new, york, herald, tribune, while, we, devote, our, industrial, and, technological, power, to, producing, new, model, automobiles, and, more, gadgets, the, soviet, union, is, conquering, space, it, is, russia, not, the, united, states, who, has, had, the, imagination, to, hitch, its, wagon, to, the, stars, and, the, skill, to, reach, for, the, moon, and, all, but, grasp, it, america, is, worried, it, should, be, eisenhower, ordered, project, vanguard, to, move, up, its, timetable, and, launch, its, satellite, much, sooner, than, originally, planned, the, december, 6, 1957, project, vanguard, launch, failure, occurred, at, cape, canaveral, air, force, station, in, florida, it, was, a, monumental, failure, exploding, a, few, seconds, after, launch, and, it, became, an, international, joke, the, satellite, appeared, in, newspapers, under, the, names, flopnik, stayputnik, kaputnik, and, dudnik, in, the, united, nations, the, soviet, delegate, offered, the, us, representative, aid, under, the, soviet, program, of, technical, assistance, to, backwards, nations, only, in, the, wake, of, this, very, public, failure, did, von, braun, s, redstone, team, get, the, go, ahead, to, launch, their, jupiter, c, rocket, as, soon, as, they, could, in, britain, the, us, s, western, cold, war, ally, the, reaction, was, mixed, some, celebrated, the, fact, that, the, soviets, had, reached, space, first, while, others, feared, the, destructive, potential, that, military, uses, of, spacecraft, might, bring, the, daily, express, predicted, that, the, us, would, catch, up, to, and, pass, the, ussr, in, space, never, doubt, for, a, moment, that, america, would, be, successful, on, january, 31, 1958, nearly, four, months, after, the, launch, of, sputnik, 1, von, braun, and, the, united, states, successfully, launched, its, first, satellite, on, a, four, stage, juno, i, rocket, derived, from, the, us, army, s, redstone, missile, at, cape, canaveral, the, satellite, explorer, 1, was, 30, 66, pounds, 13, 91, kg, in, mass, the, payload, of, explorer, 1, weighed, 18, 35, pounds, 8, 32, kg, it, carried, a, micrometeorite, gauge, and, a, geiger, m, ller, tube, it, passed, in, and, out, of, the, earth, encompassing, radiation, belt, with, its, 194, by, 1, 368, nautical, mile, 360, by, 2, 534, km, orbit, therefore, saturating, the, tube, s, capacity, and, proving, what, dr, james, van, allen, a, space, scientist, at, the, university, of, iowa, had, theorized, the, belt, named, the, van, allen, radiation, belt, is, a, doughnut, shaped, zone, of, high, level, radiation, intensity, around, the, earth, above, the, magnetic, equator, van, allen, was, also, the, man, who, designed, and, built, the, satellite, instrumentation, of, explorer, 1, the, satellite, measured, three, phenomena, cosmic, ray, and, radiation, levels, the, temperature, in, the, spacecraft, and, the, frequency, of, collisions, with, micrometeorites, the, satellite, had, no, memory, for, data, storage, therefore, it, had, to, transmit, continuously, in, march, 1958, a, second, satellite, was, sent, into, orbit, with, augmented, cosmic, ray, instruments, on, april, 2, 1958, president, eisenhower, reacted, to, the, soviet, space, lead, in, launching, the, first, satellite, by, recommending, to, the, us, congress, that, a, civilian, agency, be, established, to, direct, nonmilitary, space, activities, congress, led, by, senate, majority, leader, lyndon, b, johnson, responded, by, passing, the, national, aeronautics, and, space, act, which, eisenhower, signed, into, law, on, july, 29, 1958, this, law, turned, the, national, advisory, committee, on, aeronautics, into, the, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, nasa, it, also, created, a, civilian, military, liaison, committee, appointed, by, the, president, responsible, for, coordinating, the, nation, s, civilian, and, military, space, programs, on, october, 21, 1959, eisenhower, approved, the, transfer, of, the, army, s, remaining, space, related, activities, to, nasa, on, july, 1, 1960, the, redstone, arsenal, became, nasa, s, george, c, marshall, space, flight, center, with, von, braun, as, its, first, director, development, of, the, saturn, rocket, family, which, when, mature, gave, the, us, parity, with, the, soviets, in, terms, of, lifting, capability, was, thus, transferred, to, nasa, in, 1958, korolev, upgraded, the, r, 7, to, be, able, to, launch, a, 400, kilogram, 880, lb, payload, to, the, moon, the, luna, program, began, with, three, failed, secret, 1958, attempts, to, launch, luna, e, 1, class, impactor, probes, the, fourth, attempt, luna, 1, launched, successfully, on, january, 2, 1959, but, missed, the, moon, the, fifth, attempt, on, june, 18, also, failed, at, launch, the, 390, kilogram, 860, lb, luna, 2, successfully, impacted, the, moon, on, september, 14, 1959, the, 278, 5, kilogram, 614, lb, luna, 3, successfully, flew, by, the, moon, and, sent, back, pictures, of, its, far, side, on, october, 7, 1959, the, us, first, embarked, on, the, pioneer, program, in, 1958, by, launching, the, first, probe, albeit, ending, in, failure, a, subsequent, probe, named, pioneer, 1, was, launched, with, the, intention, of, orbiting, the, moon, only, to, result, in, a, partial, mission, success, when, it, reached, an, apogee, of, 113, 800, km, before, falling, back, to, earth, the, missions, of, pioneer, 2, and, pioneer, 3, failed, whereas, pioneer, 4, had, one, partially, successful, lunar, flyby, in, march, 1959, the, ranger, program, was, started, in, 1959, by, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, the, block, i, ranger, 1, and, ranger, 2, suffered, atlas, agena, launch, failures, in, august, and, november, 1961, the, 727, pound, 330, kg, block, ii, ranger, 3, launched, successfully, on, january, 26, 1962, but, missed, the, moon, the, 730, pound, 330, kg, ranger, 4, became, the, first, us, spacecraft, to, reach, the, moon, but, its, solar, panels, and, navigational, system, failed, near, the, moon, and, it, impacted, the, far, side, without, returning, any, scientific, data, ranger, 5, ran, out, of, power, and, missed, the, moon, by, 725, kilometers, 391, nmi, on, october, 21, 1962, the, first, successful, ranger, mission, was, the, 806, pound, 366, kg, block, iii, ranger, 7, which, impacted, on, july, 31, 1964, ranger, had, three, successful, impactors, out, of, nine, attempts, the, surveyor, program, had, five, successful, soft, landings, out, of, seven, attempts, from, 1966, to, 1968, the, lunar, orbiter, program, had, five, successes, out, of, five, attempts, in, 1966, 1967, the, us, and, the, ussr, sent, animals, into, space, to, determine, the, safety, of, the, environment, before, sending, the, first, humans, the, ussr, used, dogs, for, this, purpose, and, the, us, used, monkeys, and, apes, the, first, mammal, in, space, was, albert, ii, a, rhesus, monkey, launched, by, the, us, on, a, sub, orbital, flight, on, june, 14, 1949, who, died, on, landing, due, to, a, parachute, malfunction, the, ussr, sent, the, dog, laika, into, orbit, on, sputnik, 2, on, november, 3, 1957, for, an, intended, ten, day, flight, they, did, not, yet, have, the, technology, to, return, laika, safely, to, earth, and, the, government, reported, laika, died, when, the, oxygen, ran, out, but, in, october, 2002, her, true, cause, of, death, was, reported, as, stress, and, overheating, on, the, fourth, orbit, due, to, failure, of, the, air, conditioning, system, at, a, moscow, press, conference, in, 1998, oleg, gazenko, a, senior, soviet, scientist, involved, in, the, project, stated, the, more, time, passes, the, more, i, m, sorry, about, it, we, did, not, learn, enough, from, the, mission, to, justify, the, death, of, the, dog, on, august, 19, 1960, the, dogs, belka, and, strelka, were, sent, into, orbit, aboard, sputnik, 5, and, safely, returned, the, americans, sent, the, chimpanzee, ham, on, a, suborbital, flight, of, the, mercury, capsule, on, mercury, redstone, 2, and, recovered, him, safely, on, january, 31, 1961, the, chimpanzee, enos, was, launched, on, mercury, atlas, 5, on, november, 29, 1961, into, what, was, supposed, to, be, a, three, orbit, flight, however, the, mission, was, aborted, after, two, orbits, due, to, capsule, overheating, and, a, malfunctioning, avoidance, conditioning, test, subjecting, him, to, 76, electrical, shocks, the, soviets, designed, their, first, human, space, capsule, using, the, same, spacecraft, bus, as, their, zenit, spy, satellite, forcing, them, to, keep, the, details, and, true, appearance, secret, until, after, the, vostok, program, was, over, the, craft, consisted, of, a, spherical, descent, module, with, a, mass, of, 2, 46, tonnes, 5, 400, lb, and, a, diameter, of, 2, 3, meters, 7, 5, ft, with, a, cylindrical, inner, cabin, housing, the, cosmonaut, instruments, and, escape, system, and, a, biconic, instrument, module, with, a, mass, of, 2, 27, tonnes, 5, 000, lb, 2, 25, meters, 7, 4, ft, long, and, 2, 43, meters, 8, 0, ft, in, diameter, containing, the, engine, system, and, propellant, after, reentry, the, cosmonaut, would, eject, at, about, 7, 000, meters, 23, 000, ft, over, the, ussr, and, descend, via, parachute, while, the, capsule, would, land, separately, because, the, descent, module, made, an, extremely, rough, landing, that, could, have, left, a, cosmonaut, seriously, injured, the, vostok, spaceship, was, first, displayed, at, the, july, 1961, tushino, air, show, mounted, on, its, launch, vehicle, s, third, stage, with, the, nose, cone, in, place, concealing, the, spherical, capsule, a, tail, section, with, eight, fins, was, added, in, an, apparent, attempt, to, confuse, western, observers, this, also, appeared, on, official, commemorative, stamps, and, a, documentary, the, soviets, finally, revealed, the, true, appearance, of, their, vostok, capsule, at, the, april, 1965, moscow, economic, exhibition, on, april, 12, 1961, the, ussr, surprised, the, world, by, launching, yuri, gagarin, into, a, single, 108, minute, orbit, around, the, earth, in, a, craft, called, vostok, 1, they, dubbed, gagarin, the, first, cosmonaut, roughly, translated, from, russian, and, greek, as, sailor, of, the, universe, gagarin, s, capsule, was, flown, in, automatic, mode, since, doctors, did, not, know, what, would, happen, to, a, human, in, the, weightlessness, of, space, but, gagarin, was, given, an, envelope, containing, the, code, that, would, unlock, manual, control, in, an, emergency, gagarin, became, a, national, hero, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, eastern, bloc, and, a, worldwide, celebrity, moscow, and, other, cities, in, the, ussr, held, mass, demonstrations, the, scale, of, which, was, second, only, to, the, world, war, ii, victory, parade, of, 1945, april, 12, was, declared, cosmonautics, day, in, the, ussr, and, is, celebrated, today, in, russia, as, one, of, the, official, commemorative, dates, of, russia, in, 2011, it, was, declared, the, international, day, of, human, space, flight, by, the, united, nations, the, ussr, demonstrated, 24, hour, launch, pad, turnaround, and, launched, two, piloted, spacecraft, vostok, 3, and, vostok, 4, in, essentially, identical, orbits, on, august, 11, and, 12, 1962, the, two, spacecraft, came, within, approximately, 6, 5, kilometers, 3, 5, nautical, miles, of, one, another, close, enough, for, radio, communication, but, then, drifted, as, far, apart, as, 2, 850, kilometers, 1, 540, nautical, miles, the, vostok, had, no, maneuvering, rockets, to, keep, the, two, craft, a, controlled, distance, apart, vostok, 4, also, set, a, record, of, nearly, four, days, in, space, the, first, woman, valentina, tereshkova, was, launched, into, space, on, vostok, 6, on, june, 16, 1963, as, possibly, a, medical, experiment, she, was, the, only, one, to, fly, of, a, small, group, of, female, parachutist, factory, workers, unlike, the, male, cosmonauts, who, were, military, test, pilots, chosen, by, the, head, of, cosmonaut, training, because, he, read, a, tabloid, article, about, the, mercury, 13, group, of, women, wanting, to, become, astronauts, and, got, the, mistaken, idea, that, nasa, was, actually, entertaining, this, five, months, after, her, flight, tereshkova, married, vostok, 3, cosmonaut, andriyan, nikolayev, and, they, had, a, daughter, the, us, air, force, had, been, developing, a, program, to, launch, the, first, man, in, space, named, man, in, space, soonest, this, program, studied, several, different, types, of, one, man, space, vehicles, settling, on, a, ballistic, re, entry, capsule, launched, on, a, derivative, atlas, missile, and, selecting, a, group, of, nine, candidate, pilots, after, nasa, s, creation, the, program, was, transferred, over, to, the, civilian, agency, s, space, task, group, and, renamed, project, mercury, on, november, 26, 1958, the, mercury, spacecraft, was, designed, by, the, stg, s, chief, engineer, maxime, faget, nasa, selected, a, new, group, of, astronaut, from, the, greek, for, star, sailor, candidates, from, navy, air, force, and, marine, test, pilots, and, narrowed, this, down, to, a, group, of, seven, for, the, program, capsule, design, and, astronaut, training, began, immediately, working, toward, preliminary, suborbital, flights, on, the, redstone, missile, followed, by, orbital, flights, on, the, atlas, each, flight, series, would, first, start, unpiloted, then, carry, a, non, human, primate, then, finally, humans, the, mercury, spacecraft, s, principal, designer, was, maxime, faget, who, started, research, for, human, spaceflight, during, the, time, of, the, naca, it, consisted, of, a, conical, capsule, with, a, cylindrical, pack, of, three, solid, fuel, retro, rockets, strapped, over, a, beryllium, or, fiberglass, heat, shield, on, the, blunt, end, base, diameter, at, the, blunt, end, was, 6, 0, feet, 1, 8, m, and, length, was, 10, 8, feet, 3, 3, m, with, the, launch, escape, system, added, the, overall, length, was, 25, 9, feet, 7, 9, m, with, 100, cubic, feet, 2, 8, m, 3, of, habitable, volume, the, capsule, was, just, large, enough, for, a, single, astronaut, the, first, suborbital, spacecraft, weighed, 3, 000, pounds, 1, 400, kg, the, heaviest, mercury, atlas, 9, weighed, 3, 000, pounds, 1, 400, kg, fully, loaded, on, reentry, the, astronaut, would, stay, in, the, craft, through, splashdown, by, parachute, in, the, atlantic, ocean, on, may, 5, 1961, alan, shepard, became, the, first, american, in, space, launching, in, a, ballistic, trajectory, on, mercury, redstone, 3, in, a, spacecraft, he, named, freedom, 7, though, he, did, not, achieve, orbit, like, gagarin, he, was, the, first, person, to, exercise, manual, control, over, his, spacecraft, s, attitude, and, retro, rocket, firing, after, his, successful, return, shepard, was, celebrated, as, a, national, hero, honored, with, parades, in, washington, new, york, and, los, angeles, and, received, the, nasa, distinguished, service, medal, from, president, john, f, kennedy, american, virgil, gus, grissom, repeated, shepard, s, suborbital, flight, in, liberty, bell, 7, on, july, 21, 1961, almost, a, year, after, the, soviet, union, put, a, human, into, orbit, astronaut, john, glenn, became, the, first, american, to, orbit, the, earth, on, february, 20, 1962, his, mercury, atlas, 6, mission, completed, three, orbits, in, the, friendship, 7, spacecraft, and, splashed, down, safely, in, the, atlantic, ocean, after, a, tense, reentry, due, to, what, falsely, appeared, from, the, telemetry, data, to, be, a, loose, heat, shield, on, february, 23, 1962, president, kennedy, awarded, glenn, with, the, nasa, distinguished, service, medal, in, a, ceremony, at, cape, canaveral, air, force, station, as, the, first, american, in, orbit, glenn, became, a, national, hero, and, received, a, ticker, tape, parade, in, new, york, city, reminiscent, of, that, given, for, charles, lindbergh, the, united, states, launched, three, more, mercury, flights, after, glenn, s, aurora, 7, on, may, 24, 1962, duplicated, glenn, s, three, orbits, sigma, 7, on, october, 3, 1962, six, orbits, and, faith, 7, on, may, 15, 1963, 22, orbits, 32, 4, hours, the, maximum, capability, of, the, spacecraft, nasa, at, first, intended, to, launch, one, more, mission, extending, the, spacecraft, s, endurance, to, three, days, but, since, this, would, not, beat, the, soviet, record, it, was, decided, instead, to, concentrate, on, developing, project, gemini, these, are, extraordinary, times, and, we, face, an, extraordinary, challenge, our, strength, as, well, as, our, convictions, have, imposed, upon, this, nation, the, role, of, leader, in, freedom, s, cause, if, we, are, to, win, the, battle, that, is, now, going, on, around, the, world, between, freedom, and, tyranny, the, dramatic, achievements, in, space, which, occurred, in, recent, weeks, should, have, made, clear, to, us, all, as, did, the, sputnik, in, 1957, the, impact, of, this, adventure, on, the, minds, of, men, everywhere, who, are, attempting, to, make, a, determination, of, which, road, they, should, take, now, it, is, time, to, take, longer, strides, time, for, a, great, new, american, enterprise, time, for, this, nation, to, take, a, clearly, leading, role, in, space, achievement, which, in, many, ways, may, hold, the, key, to, our, future, on, earth, recognizing, the, head, start, obtained, by, the, soviets, with, their, large, rocket, engines, which, gives, them, many, months, of, lead, time, and, recognizing, the, likelihood, that, they, will, exploit, this, lead, for, some, time, to, come, in, still, more, impressive, successes, we, nevertheless, are, required, to, make, new, efforts, on, our, own, i, believe, that, this, nation, should, commit, itself, to, achieving, the, goal, before, this, decade, is, out, of, landing, a, man, on, the, moon, and, returning, him, safely, to, the, earth, no, single, space, project, in, this, period, will, be, more, impressive, to, mankind, or, more, important, for, the, long, range, exploration, of, space, and, none, will, be, so, difficult, or, expensive, to, accomplish, let, it, be, clear, that, i, am, asking, the, congress, and, the, country, to, accept, a, firm, commitment, to, a, new, course, of, action, a, course, which, will, last, for, many, years, and, carry, very, heavy, costs, 531, million, dollars, in, fiscal, 62, an, estimated, seven, to, nine, billion, dollars, additional, over, the, next, five, years, if, we, are, to, go, only, half, way, or, reduce, our, sights, in, the, face, of, difficulty, in, my, judgment, it, would, be, better, not, to, go, at, all, john, f, kennedy, special, message, to, congress, on, urgent, national, needs, may, 25, 1961, before, gagarin, s, flight, us, president, john, f, kennedy, s, support, for, america, s, piloted, space, program, was, lukewarm, jerome, wiesner, of, mit, who, served, as, a, science, advisor, to, presidents, eisenhower, and, kennedy, and, himself, an, opponent, of, sending, humans, into, space, remarked, if, kennedy, could, have, opted, out, of, a, big, space, program, without, hurting, the, country, in, his, judgment, he, would, have, as, late, as, march, 1961, when, nasa, administrator, james, e, webb, submitted, a, budget, request, to, fund, a, moon, landing, before, 1970, kennedy, rejected, it, because, it, was, simply, too, expensive, some, were, surprised, by, kennedy, s, eventual, support, of, nasa, and, the, space, program, because, of, how, often, he, had, attacked, the, eisenhower, administration, s, inefficiency, during, the, election, gagarin, s, flight, changed, this, now, kennedy, sensed, the, humiliation, and, fear, on, the, part, of, the, american, public, over, the, soviet, lead, additionally, the, bay, of, pigs, invasion, planned, before, his, term, began, but, executed, during, it, was, an, embarrassment, to, his, administration, due, to, the, colossal, failure, of, the, us, forces, looking, for, something, to, save, political, face, he, sent, a, memo, dated, april, 20, 1961, to, vice, president, lyndon, b, johnson, asking, him, to, look, into, the, state, of, america, s, space, program, and, into, programs, that, could, offer, nasa, the, opportunity, to, catch, up, the, two, major, options, at, the, time, were, either, the, establishment, of, an, earth, orbital, space, station, or, a, crewed, landing, on, the, moon, johnson, in, turn, consulted, with, von, braun, who, answered, kennedy, s, questions, based, on, his, estimates, of, us, and, soviet, rocket, lifting, capability, based, on, this, johnson, responded, to, kennedy, concluding, that, much, more, was, needed, to, reach, a, position, of, leadership, and, recommending, that, the, crewed, moon, landing, was, far, enough, in, the, future, that, the, us, had, a, fighting, chance, to, achieve, it, first, kennedy, ultimately, decided, to, pursue, what, became, the, apollo, program, and, on, may, 25, took, the, opportunity, to, ask, for, congressional, support, in, a, cold, war, speech, titled, special, message, on, urgent, national, needs, full, text, he, justified, the, program, in, terms, of, its, importance, to, national, security, and, its, focus, of, the, nation, s, energies, on, other, scientific, and, social, fields, he, rallied, popular, support, for, the, program, in, his, we, choose, to, go, to, the, moon, speech, on, september, 12, 1962, before, a, large, crowd, at, rice, university, stadium, in, houston, texas, near, the, construction, site, of, the, new, lyndon, b, johnson, space, center, facility, full, text, khrushchev, responded, to, kennedy, s, challenge, with, silence, refusing, to, publicly, confirm, or, deny, the, soviets, were, pursuing, a, moon, race, as, later, disclosed, the, soviet, union, secretly, pursued, two, competing, crewed, lunar, programs, soviet, decree, 655, 268, on, work, on, the, exploration, of, the, moon, and, mastery, of, space, issued, in, august, 1964, directed, vladimir, chelomei, to, develop, a, moon, flyby, program, with, a, projected, first, flight, by, the, end, of, 1966, and, directed, korolev, to, develop, the, moon, landing, program, with, a, first, flight, by, the, end, of, 1967, in, september, 1965, chelomei, s, flyby, program, was, assigned, to, korolev, who, redesigned, the, cislunar, mission, to, use, his, own, soyuz, 7k, l1, spacecraft, and, chelomei, s, proton, rocket, after, korolev, s, death, in, january, 1966, another, government, decree, of, february, 1967, moved, the, first, crewed, flyby, to, mid, 1967, and, the, first, crewed, landing, to, the, end, of, 1968, after, a, first, us, ussr, dryden, blagonravov, agreement, and, cooperation, on, the, echo, ii, balloon, satellite, in, 1962, president, kennedy, proposed, on, september, 20, 1963, in, a, speech, before, the, united, nations, general, assembly, that, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, join, forces, in, an, effort, to, reach, the, moon, kennedy, thus, changed, his, mind, regarding, the, desirability, of, the, space, race, preferring, instead, to, ease, tensions, with, the, soviet, union, by, cooperating, on, projects, such, as, a, joint, lunar, landing, soviet, premier, nikita, khrushchev, initially, rejected, kennedy, s, proposal, however, on, october, 2, 1997, it, was, reported, that, khrushchev, s, son, sergei, claimed, khrushchev, was, poised, to, accept, kennedy, s, proposal, at, the, time, of, kennedy, s, assassination, on, november, 22, 1963, during, the, next, few, weeks, he, reportedly, concluded, that, both, nations, might, realize, cost, benefits, and, technological, gains, from, a, joint, venture, and, decided, to, accept, kennedy, s, offer, based, on, a, measure, of, rapport, during, their, years, as, leaders, of, the, world, s, two, superpowers, but, changed, his, mind, and, dropped, the, idea, since, he, did, not, have, the, same, trust, for, kennedy, s, successor, lyndon, johnson, some, cooperation, in, robotic, space, exploration, nevertheless, did, take, place, such, as, a, combined, venera, 4, mariner, 5, data, analysis, under, a, joint, soviet, american, working, group, of, cospar, in, 1969, allowing, a, more, complete, drawing, of, the, profile, of, the, atmosphere, of, venus, eventually, the, apollo, soyuz, mission, was, realized, afterall, which, furthermore, laid, the, foundations, for, the, shuttle, mir, program, and, the, iss, as, president, johnson, steadfastly, pursued, the, gemini, and, apollo, programs, promoting, them, as, kennedy, s, legacy, to, the, american, public, one, week, after, kennedy, s, death, he, issued, executive, order, 11129, renaming, the, cape, canaveral, and, apollo, launch, facilities, after, kennedy, focused, by, the, commitment, to, a, moon, landing, in, january, 1962, the, us, announced, project, gemini, a, two, person, spacecraft, that, would, support, the, later, three, person, apollo, by, developing, the, key, spaceflight, technologies, of, space, rendezvous, and, docking, of, two, craft, flight, durations, of, sufficient, length, to, go, to, the, moon, and, back, and, extra, vehicular, activity, to, perform, work, outside, the, spacecraft, meanwhile, korolev, had, planned, further, long, term, missions, for, the, vostok, spacecraft, and, had, four, vostoks, in, various, stages, of, fabrication, in, late, 1963, at, his, okb, 1, facilities, the, americans, announced, plans, for, gemini, represented, major, advances, over, the, mercury, and, vostok, capsules, and, korolev, felt, the, need, to, try, to, beat, the, americans, to, many, of, these, innovations, he, had, already, begun, designing, the, vostok, s, replacement, the, next, generation, soyuz, a, multi, cosmonaut, spacecraft, that, had, at, least, the, same, capabilities, as, the, gemini, spacecraft, soyuz, would, not, be, available, for, at, least, three, years, and, it, could, not, be, called, upon, to, deal, with, this, new, american, challenge, in, 1964, or, 1965, political, pressure, in, early, 1964, which, some, sources, claim, was, from, khrushchev, while, other, sources, claim, was, from, other, communist, party, officials, pushed, him, to, modify, his, four, remaining, vostoks, to, beat, the, americans, to, new, space, firsts, in, the, size, of, flight, crews, and, the, duration, of, missions, korolev, s, conversion, of, his, surplus, vostok, capsules, to, the, voskhod, spacecraft, allowed, the, soviet, space, program, to, beat, the, gemini, program, in, achieving, the, first, spaceflight, with, a, multi, person, crew, and, the, first, spacewalk, gemini, took, a, year, longer, than, planned, to, make, its, first, flight, so, voskhod, 1, became, the, first, spaceflight, with, a, three, person, crew, on, october, 12, 1964, the, ussr, touted, another, technological, achievement, during, this, mission, it, was, the, first, space, flight, during, which, cosmonauts, performed, in, a, shirt, sleeve, environment, however, flying, without, spacesuits, was, not, due, to, safety, improvements, in, the, soviet, spacecraft, s, environmental, systems, rather, this, was, because, the, craft, s, limited, cabin, space, did, not, allow, for, spacesuits, flying, without, spacesuits, exposed, the, cosmonauts, to, significant, risk, in, the, event, of, potentially, fatal, cabin, depressurization, this, was, not, repeated, until, the, us, apollo, command, module, flew, in, 1968, the, command, module, cabin, was, designed, to, transport, three, astronauts, in, a, low, pressure, pure, oxygen, shirt, sleeve, environment, while, in, space, on, march, 18, 1965, about, a, week, before, the, first, piloted, project, gemini, space, flight, the, ussr, launched, the, two, cosmonaut, voskhod, 2, mission, with, pavel, belyayev, and, alexei, leonov, voskhod, 2, s, design, modifications, included, the, addition, of, an, inflatable, airlock, to, allow, for, extravehicular, activity, eva, also, known, as, a, spacewalk, while, keeping, the, cabin, pressurized, so, that, the, capsule, s, electronics, would, not, overheat, leonov, performed, the, first, ever, eva, as, part, of, the, mission, a, fatality, was, narrowly, avoided, when, leonov, s, spacesuit, expanded, in, the, vacuum, of, space, preventing, him, from, re, entering, the, airlock, in, order, to, overcome, this, he, had, to, partially, depressurize, his, spacesuit, to, a, potentially, dangerous, level, he, succeeded, in, safely, re, entering, the, spacecraft, but, he, and, belyayev, faced, further, challenges, when, the, spacecraft, s, atmospheric, controls, flooded, the, cabin, with, 45, pure, oxygen, which, had, to, be, lowered, to, acceptable, levels, before, re, entry, the, reentry, involved, two, more, challenges, an, improperly, timed, retrorocket, firing, caused, the, voskhod, 2, to, land, 386, kilometers, 240, mi, off, its, designated, target, area, the, city, of, perm, and, the, instrument, compartment, s, failure, to, detach, from, the, descent, apparatus, caused, the, spacecraft, to, become, unstable, during, reentry, by, october, 16, 1964, leonid, brezhnev, and, a, small, cadre, of, high, ranking, communist, party, officials, deposed, khrushchev, as, soviet, government, leader, a, day, after, voskhod, 1, landed, in, what, was, called, the, wednesday, conspiracy, the, new, political, leaders, along, with, korolev, ended, the, technologically, troublesome, voskhod, program, canceling, voskhod, 3, and, 4, which, were, in, the, planning, stages, and, started, concentrating, on, reaching, the, moon, voskhod, 2, ended, up, being, korolev, s, final, achievement, before, his, death, on, january, 14, 1966, as, it, became, the, last, of, the, space, firsts, that, the, ussr, achieved, during, the, early, 1960s, according, to, historian, asif, siddiqi, korolev, s, accomplishments, marked, the, absolute, zenith, of, the, soviet, space, program, one, never, ever, attained, since, there, was, a, two, year, pause, in, soviet, piloted, space, flights, while, voskhod, s, replacement, the, soyuz, spacecraft, was, designed, and, developed, though, delayed, a, year, to, reach, its, first, flight, gemini, was, able, to, take, advantage, of, the, ussr, s, two, year, hiatus, after, voskhod, which, enabled, the, us, to, catch, up, and, surpass, the, previous, soviet, superiority, in, piloted, spaceflight, gemini, had, ten, crewed, missions, between, march, 1965, and, november, 1966, gemini, 3, gemini, 4, gemini, 5, gemini, 6a, gemini, 7, gemini, 8, gemini, 9a, gemini, 10, gemini, 11, and, gemini, 12, and, accomplished, the, following, gemini, 8, experienced, the, first, in, space, mission, abort, on, march, 17, 1966, just, after, achieving, the, world, s, first, docking, when, a, stuck, or, shorted, thruster, sent, the, craft, into, an, uncontrolled, spin, command, pilot, neil, armstrong, was, able, to, shut, off, the, stuck, thruster, and, stop, the, spin, by, using, the, re, entry, control, system, he, and, his, crewmate, david, scott, landed, and, were, recovered, safely, most, of, the, novice, pilots, on, the, early, missions, would, command, the, later, missions, in, this, way, project, gemini, built, up, spaceflight, experience, for, the, pool, of, astronauts, for, the, apollo, lunar, missions, with, the, completion, of, gemini, the, us, had, demonstrated, all, the, technologies, necessary, to, make, kennedy, s, goal, of, landing, a, man, on, the, moon, with, the, exception, of, developing, a, large, enough, launch, vehicle, korolev, s, design, bureau, produced, two, prospectuses, for, circumlunar, spaceflight, march, 1962, and, may, 1963, the, main, spacecraft, for, which, were, early, versions, of, his, soyuz, design, at, the, same, time, another, bureau, okb, 52, headed, by, vladimir, chelomey, was, developing, the, lk, 1, lunar, flyby, spacecraft, which, would, be, launched, by, chelomey, s, proton, ur, 500, rocket, the, soviet, government, rejected, korolev, s, proposals, opting, to, support, chelomey, s, project, who, gained, favor, with, khrushchev, by, employing, his, son, officially, the, soviet, lunar, program, was, established, on, august, 3, 1964, with, the, adoption, of, soviet, communist, party, central, committee, command, 655, 268, on, work, on, the, exploration, of, the, moon, and, mastery, of, space, the, circumlunar, flights, were, planned, to, occur, in, 1967, and, the, landings, to, start, in, 1968, intending, to, land, a, person, on, the, moon, before, the, apollo, flights, both, of, the, bureaus, submitted, their, projects, for, a, crewed, lunar, landing, korolev, s, lunar, landing, program, was, designated, n1, l3, for, its, n1, super, rocket, and, a, more, advanced, soyuz, 7k, l3, spacecraft, also, known, as, the, lunar, orbital, module, lunniy, orbitalny, korabl, lok, with, a, crew, of, two, a, separate, lunar, lander, lunniy, korabl, lk, would, carry, a, single, cosmonaut, to, the, lunar, surface, the, n1, l3, launch, vehicle, had, three, stages, to, earth, orbit, a, fourth, stage, for, earth, departure, and, a, fifth, stage, for, lunar, landing, assist, the, combined, space, vehicle, was, roughly, the, same, height, and, takeoff, mass, as, the, three, stage, us, apollo, saturn, v, and, exceeded, its, takeoff, thrust, by, 28, 45, 400, kn, vs, 33, 000, kn, but, had, only, about, half, the, translunar, injection, payload, capability, the, saturn, v, used, liquid, hydrogen, fuel, in, its, two, upper, stages, and, carried, a, 48, 6, tonne, 107, 000, lb, payload, to, the, moon, enough, for, a, three, person, orbiter, and, two, person, lander, the, ussr, did, not, use, liquid, hydrogen, until, after, the, n, 1, was, canceled, therefore, it, was, only, capable, of, a, 23, 5, tonne, 52, 000, lb, translunar, payload, chelomey, s, program, assumed, using, a, direct, ascent, lander, based, on, the, lk, 1, lk, 700, which, would, be, launched, using, his, proposed, ur, 700, rocket, following, khrushchev, s, ouster, from, power, chelomey, lost, his, support, in, the, soviet, government, and, his, proposal, didn, t, receive, any, funding, additionally, in, august, 1965, due, to, korolev, s, opposition, work, on, the, lk, 1, was, suspended, and, later, stopped, completely, as, a, replacement, the, circumlunar, mission, would, use, a, stripped, down, soyuz, 7k, l1, zond, while, still, retaining, the, proton, ur, 500, booster, in, order, to, fit, two, crewmembers, the, zond, had, to, omit, the, soyuz, orbital, module, sacrificing, equipment, for, habitable, cabin, volume, the, us, and, ussr, began, discussions, on, the, peaceful, uses, of, space, as, early, as, 1958, presenting, issues, for, debate, to, the, united, nations, which, created, a, committee, on, the, peaceful, uses, of, outer, space, in, 1959, on, may, 10, 1962, vice, president, johnson, addressed, the, second, national, conference, on, the, peaceful, uses, of, space, revealing, that, the, united, states, and, the, ussr, both, supported, a, resolution, passed, by, the, political, committee, of, the, un, general, assembly, in, december, 1962, which, not, only, urged, member, nations, to, extend, the, rules, of, international, law, to, outer, space, but, to, also, cooperate, in, its, exploration, following, the, passing, of, this, resolution, kennedy, commenced, his, communications, proposing, a, cooperative, american, and, soviet, space, program, the, un, ultimately, created, a, treaty, on, principles, governing, the, activities, of, states, in, the, exploration, and, use, of, outer, space, including, the, moon, and, other, celestial, bodies, which, was, signed, by, the, united, states, the, ussr, and, the, united, kingdom, on, january, 27, 1967, and, came, into, force, the, following, october, 10, this, treaty, the, treaty, remains, in, force, signed, by, 107, member, states, as, of, july, 2017, in, 1967, both, nations, space, programs, faced, serious, challenges, that, brought, them, to, temporary, halts, on, january, 27, 1967, the, same, day, the, us, and, ussr, signed, the, outer, space, treaty, the, crew, of, the, first, crewed, apollo, mission, command, pilot, virgil, gus, grissom, senior, pilot, ed, white, and, pilot, roger, chaffee, were, killed, in, a, fire, that, swept, through, their, spacecraft, cabin, during, a, ground, test, less, than, a, month, before, the, planned, february, 21, launch, an, investigative, board, determined, the, fire, was, probably, caused, by, an, electrical, spark, and, quickly, grew, out, of, control, fed, by, the, spacecraft, s, atmosphere, of, pure, oxygen, at, greater, than, one, standard, atmosphere, crew, escape, was, made, impossible, by, inability, to, open, the, plug, door, hatch, cover, against, the, internal, pressure, the, board, also, found, design, and, construction, flaws, in, the, spacecraft, and, procedural, failings, including, failure, to, appreciate, the, hazard, of, the, pure, oxygen, atmosphere, as, well, as, inadequate, safety, procedures, all, these, flaws, had, to, be, corrected, over, the, next, twenty, two, months, until, the, first, piloted, flight, could, be, made, mercury, and, gemini, veteran, grissom, had, been, a, favored, choice, of, deke, slayton, nasa, s, director, of, flight, crew, operations, to, make, the, first, piloted, landing, on, april, 24, 1967, the, single, pilot, of, soyuz, 1, vladimir, komarov, became, the, first, in, flight, spaceflight, fatality, the, mission, was, planned, to, be, a, three, day, test, to, include, the, first, soviet, docking, with, an, unpiloted, soyuz, 2, but, the, mission, was, plagued, with, problems, early, on, komarov, s, craft, lacked, sufficient, electrical, power, because, only, one, of, two, solar, panels, had, deployed, then, the, automatic, attitude, control, system, began, malfunctioning, and, eventually, failed, completely, resulting, in, the, craft, spinning, wildly, komarov, was, able, to, stop, the, spin, with, the, manual, system, which, was, only, partially, effective, the, flight, controllers, aborted, his, mission, after, only, one, day, during, the, emergency, re, entry, a, fault, in, the, landing, parachute, system, caused, the, primary, chute, to, fail, and, the, reserve, chute, became, tangled, with, the, drogue, chute, causing, descent, speed, to, reach, as, high, as, 40, m, s, 140, km, h, 89, mph, shortly, thereafter, soyuz, 1, impacted, the, ground, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, west, of, karabutak, exploding, into, a, ball, of, flames, the, official, autopsy, states, komarov, died, of, blunt, force, trauma, on, impact, and, that, the, subsequent, heat, mutilation, of, his, corpse, was, a, result, of, the, explosive, impact, fixing, the, spacecraft, s, faults, caused, an, eighteen, month, delay, before, piloted, soyuz, flights, could, resume, the, united, states, recovered, from, the, apollo, 1, fire, fixing, the, fatal, flaws, in, an, improved, version, of, the, block, ii, command, module, the, us, proceeded, with, unpiloted, test, launches, of, the, saturn, v, launch, vehicle, apollo, 4, and, apollo, 6, and, the, lunar, module, apollo, 5, during, the, latter, half, of, 1967, and, early, 1968, the, first, saturn, v, flight, was, an, unqualified, success, and, although, the, second, suffered, some, non, catastrophic, engine, failures, it, was, considered, a, partial, success, and, the, launcher, achieved, human, rating, qualification, apollo, 1, s, mission, to, check, out, the, apollo, command, and, service, module, in, earth, orbit, was, accomplished, by, grissom, s, backup, crew, on, apollo, 7, launched, on, october, 11, 1968, the, eleven, day, mission, was, a, total, success, as, the, spacecraft, performed, a, virtually, flawless, mission, paving, the, way, for, the, united, states, to, continue, with, its, lunar, mission, schedule, the, soviet, union, also, fixed, the, parachute, and, control, problems, with, soyuz, and, the, next, piloted, mission, soyuz, 3, was, launched, on, october, 26, 1968, the, goal, was, to, complete, komarov, s, rendezvous, and, docking, mission, with, the, un, piloted, soyuz, 2, ground, controllers, brought, the, two, craft, to, within, 200, meters, 660, ft, of, each, other, then, cosmonaut, georgy, beregovoy, took, control, he, got, within, 40, meters, 130, ft, of, his, target, but, was, unable, to, dock, before, expending, 90, percent, of, his, maneuvering, fuel, due, to, a, piloting, error, that, put, his, spacecraft, into, the, wrong, orientation, and, forced, soyuz, 2, to, automatically, turn, away, from, his, approaching, craft, the, first, docking, of, soviet, spacecraft, was, finally, realized, in, january, 1969, by, the, soyuz, 4, and, soyuz, 5, missions, it, was, the, first, ever, docking, of, two, crewed, spacecraft, and, the, first, transfer, of, crew, from, one, space, vehicle, to, another, the, soviet, zond, spacecraft, was, not, yet, ready, for, piloted, circumlunar, missions, in, 1968, after, six, unsuccessful, automated, test, launches, kosmos, 146, on, march, 10, 1967, kosmos, 154, on, april, 8, 1967, zond, 1967a, on, september, 28, 1967, zond, 1967b, on, november, 22, 1967, zond, 1968a, on, april, 23, 1968, and, zond, 1968b, in, july, 1968, zond, 4, was, launched, on, march, 2, 1968, and, successfully, made, a, circumlunar, flight, but, encountered, problems, with, its, earth, reentry, on, march, 9, and, was, ordered, destroyed, by, an, explosive, charge, 15, 000, meters, 49, 000, ft, over, the, gulf, of, guinea, the, soviet, official, announcement, said, that, zond, 4, was, an, automated, test, flight, which, ended, with, its, intentional, destruction, due, to, its, recovery, trajectory, positioning, it, over, the, atlantic, ocean, instead, of, over, the, ussr, during, the, summer, of, 1968, the, apollo, program, hit, another, snag, the, first, pilot, rated, lunar, module, lm, was, not, ready, for, orbital, tests, in, time, for, a, december, 1968, launch, nasa, planners, overcame, this, challenge, by, changing, the, mission, flight, order, delaying, the, first, lm, flight, until, march, 1969, and, sending, apollo, 8, into, lunar, orbit, without, the, lm, in, december, this, mission, was, in, part, motivated, by, intelligence, rumors, the, soviet, union, might, be, ready, for, a, piloted, zond, flight, in, late, 1968, in, september, 1968, zond, 5, made, a, circumlunar, flight, with, tortoises, on, board, and, returned, safely, to, earth, accomplishing, the, first, successful, water, landing, of, the, soviet, space, program, in, the, indian, ocean, it, also, scared, nasa, planners, as, it, took, them, several, days, to, figure, out, that, it, was, only, an, automated, flight, not, piloted, because, voice, recordings, were, transmitted, from, the, craft, en, route, to, the, moon, on, november, 10, 1968, another, automated, test, flight, zond, 6, was, launched, it, encountered, difficulties, in, earth, reentry, and, depressurized, and, deployed, its, parachute, too, early, causing, it, to, crash, land, only, 16, kilometers, 9, 9, mi, from, where, it, had, been, launched, six, days, earlier, it, turned, out, there, was, no, chance, of, a, piloted, soviet, circumlunar, flight, during, 1968, due, to, the, unreliability, of, the, zonds, on, december, 21, 1968, frank, borman, james, lovell, and, william, anders, became, the, first, humans, to, ride, the, saturn, v, rocket, into, space, on, apollo, 8, they, also, became, the, first, to, leave, low, earth, orbit, and, go, to, another, celestial, body, entering, lunar, orbit, on, december, 24, they, made, ten, orbits, in, twenty, hours, and, transmitted, one, of, the, most, watched, tv, broadcasts, in, history, with, their, christmas, eve, program, from, lunar, orbit, which, concluded, with, a, reading, from, the, biblical, book, of, genesis, two, and, a, half, hours, after, the, broadcast, they, fired, their, engine, to, perform, the, first, trans, earth, injection, to, leave, lunar, orbit, and, return, to, the, earth, apollo, 8, safely, landed, in, the, pacific, ocean, on, december, 27, in, nasa, s, first, dawn, splashdown, and, recovery, the, american, lunar, module, was, finally, ready, for, a, successful, piloted, test, flight, in, low, earth, orbit, on, apollo, 9, in, march, 1969, the, next, mission, apollo, 10, conducted, a, dress, rehearsal, for, the, first, landing, in, may, 1969, flying, the, lm, in, lunar, orbit, as, close, as, 47, 400, feet, 14, 4, km, above, the, surface, the, point, where, the, powered, descent, to, the, surface, would, begin, with, the, lm, proven, to, work, well, the, next, step, was, to, attempt, the, landing, unknown, to, the, americans, the, soviet, moon, program, was, in, deep, trouble, after, two, successive, launch, failures, of, the, n1, rocket, in, 1969, soviet, plans, for, a, piloted, landing, suffered, delay, the, launch, pad, explosion, of, the, n, 1, on, july, 3, 1969, was, a, significant, setback, the, rocket, hit, the, pad, after, an, engine, shutdown, destroying, itself, and, the, launch, facility, without, the, n, 1, rocket, the, ussr, could, not, send, a, large, enough, payload, to, the, moon, to, land, a, human, and, return, him, safely, at, the, same, time, the, soviet, union, developed, the, lunokhod, rovers, and, attempted, to, land, on, the, moon, robotically, in, early, 1969, but, failed, to, launch, and, land, lunokhod, 0, lunokhod, 1, succeeded, in, 1970, being, the, first, successful, soviet, sample, return, mission, apollo, 11, was, prepared, with, the, goal, of, a, july, landing, in, the, sea, of, tranquility, just, half, a, year, after, the, first, crewed, flight, to, the, moon, the, crew, selected, in, january, 1969, consisted, of, commander, cdr, neil, armstrong, command, module, pilot, cmp, michael, collins, and, lunar, module, pilot, lmp, edwin, buzz, aldrin, they, trained, for, the, mission, until, just, before, the, launch, day, on, july, 16, 1969, at, 9, 32, am, edt, the, saturn, v, rocket, as, 506, lifted, off, from, kennedy, space, center, launch, complex, 39, in, florida, the, trip, to, the, moon, took, just, over, three, days, after, achieving, orbit, armstrong, and, aldrin, transferred, into, the, lunar, module, named, eagle, leaving, collins, in, the, command, and, service, module, columbia, and, began, their, descent, despite, the, interruption, of, alarms, from, an, overloaded, computer, caused, by, an, antenna, switch, left, in, the, wrong, position, armstrong, took, over, manual, flight, control, at, about, 180, meters, 590, ft, to, correct, a, slight, downrange, guidance, error, and, set, the, eagle, down, on, a, safe, landing, spot, at, 20, 18, 04, utc, july, 20, 1969, 3, 17, 04, pm, cdt, six, hours, later, at, 02, 56, utc, july, 21, 9, 56, pm, cdt, july, 20, armstrong, left, the, eagle, to, become, the, first, human, to, set, foot, on, the, moon, the, first, step, was, witnessed, on, live, television, by, at, least, one, fifth, of, the, population, of, earth, or, about, 723, million, people, his, first, words, when, he, stepped, off, the, lm, s, landing, footpad, were, that, s, one, small, step, for, man, one, giant, leap, for, mankind, aldrin, joined, him, on, the, surface, almost, 20, minutes, later, altogether, they, spent, just, under, two, and, one, quarter, hours, outside, their, craft, the, next, day, they, performed, the, first, launch, from, another, celestial, body, and, rendezvoused, back, with, collins, in, columbia, but, before, they, return, ascended, the, space, race, came, to, a, particular, culmination, few, days, before, apollo, 11, left, earth, the, soviet, union, launched, the, luna, 15, probe, entering, lunar, orbit, just, before, apollo, 11, and, eventually, sharing, it, with, apollo, 11, aware, of, luna, 15, apollo, 8, astronaut, frank, borman, was, asked, to, use, his, goodwill, contacts, in, the, soviet, union, to, prevent, any, collision, subsequently, in, one, of, the, first, instances, of, soviet, american, space, communication, the, soviet, union, released, luna, 15, s, flight, plan, to, ensure, it, would, not, collide, with, apollo, 11, although, its, exact, mission, was, not, publicized, but, as, apollo, 11, was, wrapping, up, surface, activities, the, soviet, mission, command, hastened, luna, 15, and, attempted, its, robotic, sample, return, mission, before, apollo, 11, would, return, as, luna, 15, descended, just, two, hours, before, apollo, 11, s, launch, and, impacted, at, 15, 50, utc, some, hundred, kilometers, away, from, apollo, 11, british, astronomers, monitoring, luna, 15, recorded, the, situation, with, one, commenting, i, say, this, has, really, been, drama, of, the, highest, order, apollo, 11, left, lunar, orbit, and, returned, to, earth, landing, safely, in, the, pacific, ocean, on, july, 24, 1969, when, the, spacecraft, splashed, down, 2, 982, days, had, passed, since, kennedy, s, commitment, to, landing, a, man, on, the, moon, and, returning, him, safely, to, the, earth, before, the, end, of, the, decade, the, mission, was, completed, with, 161, days, to, spare, with, the, safe, completion, of, the, apollo, 11, mission, the, americans, won, the, race, to, the, moon, armstrong, and, his, crew, became, worldwide, celebrities, feted, with, ticker, tape, parades, on, august, 13, in, new, york, city, and, chicago, attended, by, an, estimated, six, million, that, evening, in, los, angeles, they, were, honored, at, an, official, state, dinner, attended, by, members, of, congress, 44, governors, the, chief, justice, of, the, united, states, and, ambassadors, from, 83, nations, the, president, and, vice, president, presented, each, astronaut, with, the, presidential, medal, of, freedom, the, astronauts, spoke, before, a, joint, session, of, congress, on, september, 16, 1969, this, began, a, 38, day, world, tour, to, 22, foreign, countries, and, included, visits, with, the, leaders, of, many, countries, the, public, s, reaction, in, the, soviet, union, was, mixed, the, soviet, government, limited, the, release, of, information, about, the, lunar, landing, which, affected, the, reaction, a, portion, of, the, populace, did, not, give, it, any, attention, and, another, portion, was, angered, by, it, the, first, landing, was, followed, by, another, precision, landing, on, apollo, 12, in, november, 1969, within, walking, distance, of, the, surveyor, 3, spacecraft, which, landed, on, april, 20, 1967, nasa, had, ambitious, follow, on, human, spaceflight, plans, as, it, reached, its, lunar, goal, but, soon, discovered, it, had, expended, most, of, its, political, capital, to, do, so, a, victim, of, its, own, success, apollo, had, achieved, its, first, landing, goal, with, enough, spacecraft, and, saturn, v, launchers, left, for, a, total, of, ten, lunar, landings, through, apollo, 20, conducting, extended, duration, missions, and, transporting, the, landing, crews, in, lunar, roving, vehicles, on, the, last, five, nasa, also, planned, an, apollo, applications, program, aap, to, develop, a, longer, duration, earth, orbital, workshop, later, named, skylab, from, a, spent, s, ivb, upper, stage, to, be, constructed, in, orbit, using, several, launches, of, the, smaller, saturn, ib, launch, vehicle, in, february, 1969, president, richard, m, nixon, convened, a, space, task, group, to, set, recommendations, for, the, future, us, civilian, space, program, headed, by, his, vice, president, spiro, t, agnew, agnew, was, an, enthusiastic, proponent, of, nasa, s, follow, up, plans, for, permanent, space, stations, in, earth, and, lunar, orbit, perhaps, a, base, on, the, lunar, surface, and, the, first, human, flight, to, mars, as, early, as, 1986, or, as, late, as, 2000, these, would, be, serviced, by, an, infrastructure, of, a, reusable, space, transportation, system, including, an, earth, to, orbit, space, shuttle, nixon, had, a, better, sense, of, the, declining, political, support, in, congress, for, new, apollo, style, programs, which, had, disappeared, with, the, achievement, of, the, landing, and, he, intended, to, pursue, d, tente, with, the, ussr, and, china, which, he, hoped, might, ease, cold, war, tensions, he, cut, the, spending, proposal, he, sent, to, congress, to, include, funding, for, only, the, space, shuttle, with, perhaps, an, option, to, pursue, the, earth, orbital, space, station, for, the, foreseeable, future, aap, planners, decided, the, earth, orbital, workshop, could, be, accomplished, more, efficiently, by, prefabricating, it, on, the, ground, and, launching, it, with, a, single, saturn, v, which, immediately, eliminated, apollo, 20, budget, cuts, soon, led, nasa, to, cut, apollo, 18, and, 19, as, well, apollo, 13, had, to, abort, its, lunar, landing, in, april, 1970, due, to, an, in, flight, spacecraft, failure, but, returned, its, crew, safely, to, earth, the, apollo, program, made, its, final, lunar, landing, in, december, 1972, the, two, unused, saturn, vs, were, used, as, outdoor, visitor, displays, and, allowed, to, deteriorate, due, to, the, effects, of, weathering, the, ussr, continued, trying, to, develop, its, n1, rocket, after, two, more, launch, failures, in, 1971, and, 1972, finally, canceling, it, in, may, 1974, without, achieving, a, single, successful, uncrewed, test, flight, having, lost, the, race, to, the, moon, the, ussr, decided, to, concentrate, on, orbital, space, stations, during, 1969, and, 1970, they, launched, six, more, soyuz, flights, after, soyuz, 3, and, then, launched, a, series, of, six, successful, space, stations, plus, two, failures, to, achieve, orbit, and, one, station, rendered, uninhabitable, due, to, damage, from, explosion, of, the, launcher, s, upper, stage, on, their, proton, k, heavy, lift, launcher, in, their, salyut, program, designed, by, kerim, kerimov, each, one, weighed, between, 18, 500, and, 19, 824, kilograms, 40, 786, and, 43, 704, lb, was, 20, meters, 66, ft, long, by, 4, meters, 13, ft, in, diameter, and, had, a, habitable, volume, of, 99, cubic, meters, 3, 500, cu, ft, all, of, the, salyuts, were, presented, to, the, public, as, non, military, scientific, laboratories, but, three, of, them, were, covers, for, military, almaz, reconnaissance, stations, salyut, 2, failed, salyut, 3, and, salyut, 5, salyut, 1, the, first, space, station, was, launched, by, the, soviets, on, april, 19, 1971, three, days, later, the, soyuz, 10, crew, attempted, to, dock, with, it, but, failed, to, achieve, a, secure, enough, connection, to, safely, enter, the, station, the, soyuz, 11, crew, of, vladislav, volkov, georgi, dobrovolski, and, viktor, patsayev, successfully, docked, on, june, 7, and, completed, a, record, 22, day, stay, the, crew, became, the, second, in, flight, space, fatality, during, their, reentry, on, june, 30, they, were, asphyxiated, when, their, spacecraft, s, cabin, lost, all, pressure, shortly, after, undocking, the, disaster, was, blamed, on, a, faulty, cabin, pressure, valve, that, allowed, all, the, air, to, vent, into, space, the, crew, was, not, wearing, pressure, suits, and, had, no, chance, of, survival, once, the, leak, occurred, the, united, states, launched, a, single, orbital, workstation, skylab, on, may, 14, 1973, it, weighed, 169, 950, pounds, 77, 090, kg, was, 58, feet, 18, m, long, by, 21, 7, feet, 6, 6, m, in, diameter, and, had, a, habitable, volume, of, 10, 000, cubic, feet, 280, m, 3, skylab, was, damaged, during, the, ascent, to, orbit, losing, one, of, its, solar, panels, and, a, meteoroid, thermal, shield, subsequent, crewed, missions, repaired, the, station, and, the, third, and, final, mission, s, crew, skylab, 4, set, a, human, endurance, record, at, the, time, with, 84, days, in, orbit, when, the, mission, ended, on, february, 8, 1974, skylab, stayed, in, orbit, another, five, years, before, reentering, the, earth, s, atmosphere, over, the, indian, ocean, and, western, australia, on, july, 11, 1979, salyut, 4, broke, skylab, s, occupation, record, at, 92, days, salyut, 6, and, salyut, 7, were, second, generation, stations, designed, for, long, duration, and, were, occupied, for, 683, and, 816, days, in, may, 1972, president, richard, m, nixon, and, soviet, premier, leonid, brezhnev, negotiated, an, easing, of, relations, known, as, d, tente, creating, a, temporary, thaw, in, the, cold, war, the, two, nations, planned, a, joint, mission, to, dock, the, last, us, apollo, craft, with, a, soyuz, known, as, the, apollo, soyuz, test, project, astp, to, prepare, the, us, designed, a, docking, module, for, the, apollo, that, was, compatible, with, the, soviet, docking, system, which, allowed, any, of, their, craft, to, dock, with, any, other, e, g, soyuz, to, soyuz, as, well, as, soyuz, to, salyut, the, module, was, also, necessary, as, an, airlock, to, allow, the, men, to, visit, each, other, s, craft, which, had, incompatible, cabin, atmospheres, the, ussr, used, the, soyuz, 16, mission, in, december, 1974, to, test, modifications, of, the, soyuz, atmosphere, and, the, docking, adapter, to, prepare, for, astp, the, joint, mission, began, when, soyuz, 19, was, first, launched, on, july, 15, 1975, at, 12, 20, utc, and, the, apollo, craft, was, launched, with, the, docking, module, six, and, a, half, hours, later, the, two, craft, rendezvoused, and, docked, on, july, 17, at, 16, 19, utc, the, three, astronauts, conducted, joint, experiments, with, the, two, cosmonauts, and, the, crew, shook, hands, exchanged, gifts, and, visited, each, other, s, craft, nasa, achieved, the, first, approach, and, landing, test, of, its, space, shuttle, orbiter, on, a, boeing, 747, carrier, plane, on, august, 12, 1977, and, the, first, orbital, test, flight, of, a, complete, crewed, space, shuttle, consisting, of, the, orbiter, an, external, fuel, tank, and, two, solid, rocket, boosters, on, april, 12, 1981, the, designers, underestimated, the, time, and, cost, of, refurbishment, between, flights, which, reduced, the, cost, benefit, of, its, reusability, they, also, overestimated, its, safety, two, of, the, fleet, of, five, orbiters, were, lost, in, fatal, flight, accidents, one, during, launch, due, to, failure, of, a, solid, rocket, booster, seal, and, one, on, reentry, due, to, launch, damage, of, a, wing, heat, shield, the, air, force, was, also, supposed, to, use, the, shuttle, to, launch, its, military, payloads, but, shunned, it, in, favor, of, its, expendable, launchers, after, the, first, shuttle, loss, nasa, ceased, production, of, its, apollo, spacecraft, and, saturn, ib, launcher, and, used, the, shuttle, as, its, orbital, workhorse, until, 2011, then, retired, it, due, to, the, safety, concern, originally, more, than, 150, flights, over, a, 15, year, operation, were, expected, actually, the, shuttle, made, 135, flights, in, its, 30, year, lifespan, the, soviets, mistook, the, shuttle, as, a, military, surveillance, vehicle, and, decided, they, had, to, develop, their, own, shuttle, which, they, named, buran, beginning, in, 1974, they, copied, the, aerodynamic, design, of, nasa, s, shuttle, orbiter, which, they, strapped, to, the, side, of, their, expendable, liquid, hydrogen, fueled, energia, launcher, the, buran, could, be, fitted, with, four, saturn, al, 31, turbofan, engines, and, a, fuel, tank, in, its, payload, bay, allowing, it, to, make, its, own, atmospheric, test, flights, which, began, in, november, 1985, also, unlike, the, us, shuttle, it, could, be, flown, pilotlessly, and, landed, automatically, energia, buran, made, only, one, orbital, test, flight, in, november, 1988, but, us, counterintelligence, baited, the, soviets, with, disinformation, about, the, heat, shield, design, and, it, was, not, reusable, for, repeated, flight, buran, was, the, largest, and, most, expensive, soviet, program, in, the, history, of, the, space, race, and, was, effectively, canceled, by, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, due, to, lack, of, funding, the, energia, was, also, canceled, at, the, same, time, after, only, two, flights, the, first, woman, in, space, was, from, the, soviet, union, valentina, tereshkova, nasa, did, not, welcome, female, astronauts, into, its, corps, until, 1978, when, six, female, mission, specialists, were, recruited, this, first, class, included, scientist, sally, ride, who, became, america, s, first, woman, in, space, on, sts, 7, in, june, 1983, nasa, included, women, mission, specialists, in, the, next, four, astronaut, candidate, classes, and, admitted, female, pilots, starting, in, 1990, eileen, collins, from, this, class, became, the, first, pilot, to, fly, on, space, shuttle, flight, sts, 63, in, february, 1995, and, the, first, female, commander, of, a, spaceflight, on, sts, 93, in, july, 1999, the, ussr, admitted, its, first, female, test, pilot, as, a, cosmonaut, svetlana, savitskaya, in, 1980, she, became, the, first, female, to, fly, since, tereshkova, on, salyut, 7, in, december, 1981, the, ussr, turned, its, space, program, to, the, development, of, the, low, earth, orbit, modular, space, station, mir, peace, or, world, assembled, in, orbit, from, 1986, to, 1996, at, 129, 700, kilograms, 285, 900, lb, it, held, records, for, the, largest, spacecraft, and, the, longest, continuous, human, presence, in, space, at, 3, 644, days, until, the, international, space, station, was, built, starting, in, 1998, mir, s, operation, continued, after, the, 1991, replacement, of, the, ussr, s, space, program, with, the, russian, federal, space, agency, until, 2001, supported, by, soyuz, spacecraft, according, to, american, political, scientist, richard, j, samuels, the, space, race, is, generally, regarded, as, a, decisive, american, victory, after, apollo, 11, however, according, to, historian, jennifer, frost, f, we, define, the, space, race, as, spaceflight, capability, the, soviets, won, it, hands, down, space, historian, asif, a, siddiqi, proposes, more, nuanced, view, before, that, landing, there, was, an, enormous, amount, of, investment, in, the, robotic, exploration, of, the, moon, both, by, the, soviets, and, the, us, in, terms, of, all, sorts, of, smaller, benchmarks, like, the, first, lunar, impact, the, first, pictures, of, the, far, side, of, the, moon, the, first, soft, lunar, landing, and, the, first, lunar, orbit, we, forget, but, in, those, little, races, the, soviet, union, dominated, almost, every, benchmark, but, it, is, forgotten, as, the, united, states, won, the, big, one, after, the, end, of, the, cold, war, in, 1991, the, assets, of, the, ussr, s, space, program, passed, mainly, to, russia, since, then, the, united, states, and, russia, have, cooperated, in, space, with, the, shuttle, mir, program, and, the, international, space, station, iss, the, russians, continue, to, use, their, r, 7, rocket, family, as, their, orbital, workhorse, to, launch, the, soyuz, crewed, spacecraft, and, its, progress, derivative, uncrewed, cargo, craft, as, shuttles, to, the, iss, after, the, 2011, retirement, of, the, space, shuttle, american, crews, were, dependent, on, the, r, 7, soyuz, to, reach, the, iss, until, the, 2020, first, flight, of, the, us, crew, dragon, commercial, crew, development, vehicle
