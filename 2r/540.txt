or, revolutions, like, in, germany, austria, hungary, or, russia, this, is, despite, famine, and, economic, collapse, that, was, brought, on, by, the, extreme, levels, of, mobilization, destruction,

to, occupy, in, case, of, disorder, any, territory, if, there, were, a, threat, to, security, the, clause, relating, to, the, occupation, of, the, straits, was, meant, to, secure, a, southern, russian, intervention, force, while, the, rest, of, the, article, was, used, to, allow, for, allied, controlled, peace, keeping, forces, there, was, also, a, hope, to, follow, through, punishing, local, actors, that, carried, out, exterminatory, orders, from, the, cup, government, against, armenian, ottomans, for, now, the, house, of, osman, escaped, the, fates, of, the, hohenzollerns,

he, reluctantly, did, following, which, he, was, recalled, to, constantinople, he, made, sure, to, distribute, weapons, to, the, population, to, prevent, them, from, falling, into, the, hands, of, allied, forces, some, of, these, weapons, were, smuggled, to, the, east, by, members, of, karakol, a, successor, to, the, cup, s, special, organization, to, be, used, in, case, resistance, was, necessary, in, anatolia, many, ottoman, officials, participated, in, efforts, to, conceal, from, the, occupying, authorities, details, of, the, burgeoning, independence, movement, spreading,

anglophilia, and, an, attitude, of, appeasement, would, induce, less, harsh, peace, terms, from, the, allied, powers, however, his, appointment, was, problematic, for, the, unionists, many, being, members, of, the, liquidated, committee, that, were, surely, to, face, trial, years, of, corruption, unconstitutional, acts, war, profiteering, and, enrichment, from, ethnic, cleansing, and, genocide,

fight, amongst, each, other, instead, of, returning, to, civilian, life, albanian, and, circassian, muhacirs, resettled, by, the, government, in, northwestern, anatolia, and, kurds, in, southeastern,

could, facilitate, truces, various, muhacir, groups, were, suspicious, of, the, continued, unionist, ideology, in, the, defence, of, rights, movement, and, the, potential, for, themselves, to, meet,

mehmed, vi, established, the, military, inspectorate, system, to, reestablish, authority, over, the, remaining, empire, encouraged, by, karabekir, and, edmund, allenby, he, assigned, mustafa, kemal, pasha, atat, rk, as, the, inspector, of, the, ninth, army, troops, inspectorate, based, in, erzurum, to, restore, order, to, ottoman, military, units, and, to, improve, internal, security, on, 30, april, 1919, with, his, first, assignment, to, suppress, a, rebellion, by, greek, rebels, around, the, city, of, samsun, mustafa, kemal, was, a, well, known, well, respected, and, well, connected, army, commander, with, much, prestige, coming, from, his, status, as, the, hero, of, anafartalar, for, his, role, in, the, gallipoli, campaign, and, his, title, of, honorary, aide, de, camp, to, his, majesty, sultan, gained, in, the, last, months, of, wwi, this, choice, would, seem, curious, as, he, was, a, nationalist, and, a, fierce, critic, of, the, government, s, accommodating, policy, to, the, entente, powers, he, was, also, an, early, member, of, the, cup, however, kemal, pasha, did, not, associate, himself, with, the, fanatical, faction, of, the, cup, many, knew, that, he, frequently, clashed, with, the, radicals, of, the, central, committee, like, enver, he, was, therefore, sidelined, to, the, periphery, of, power, throughout, the, great, war, after, the, cup, s, dissolution, he, vocally, aligned, himself, with, moderates, that, formed, the, liberal, people, s, party, instead, of, the, rump, radical, faction, which, formed, the, renewal, party, both, parties, would, be, banned, in, may, 1919, for, being, successors, of, the, cup, all, these, reasons, allowed, him, to, be, the, most, legitimate, nationalist, for, the, sultan, to, placate, in, this, new, political, climate, he, sought, to, capitalize, on, his, war, exploits, to, attain, a, better, job, indeed, several, times, he, unsuccessfully, lobbied, for, his, inclusion, in, cabinet, as, war, minister, his, new, assignment, gave, him, effective, plenipotentiary, powers, over, all, of, anatolia, which, was, meant, to, accommodate, him, and, other, nationalists, to, keep, them, loyal, to, the, government, mustafa, kemal, had, earlier, declined, to, become, the, leader, of, the, sixth, army, headquartered, in, nusaybin, but, according, to, patrick, balfour, through, manipulation, and, the, help, of, friends, and, sympathizers, he, became, the, inspector, of, virtually, all, of, the, ottoman, forces, in, anatolia, tasked, with, overseeing, the, disbanding, process, of, remaining, ottoman, forces, kemal, had, an, abundance, of, connections, and, personal, friends, concentrated, in, the, post, armistice, war, ministry, a, powerful, tool, that, would, help, him, accomplish, his, secret, goal, to, lead, a, nationalist, movement, to, safeguard, turkish, interests, against, the, allied, powers, and, a, collaborative, ottoman, government, the, day, before, his, departure, to, samsun, on, the, remote, black, sea, coast, kemal, had, one, last, audience, with, sultan, vahdettin, where, he, affirmed, his, loyalty, to, the, sultan, caliph, it, was, in, this, meeting, that,

exercise, control, over, hatay, lebanon, syria, and, a, portion, of, southeastern, anatolia, based, on, the, sykes, picot, agreement, greece, justified, their, territorial, claims, of, ottoman, land, not, least, from, greece, s, entrance, to, wwi, on, the, allied, side, but, also, through, the, megali, idea, as, well, as, international, sympathy, from, the, suffering, of, ottoman, greeks, in,

and, unifying, movement, the, delegates, had, to, swear, an, oath, to, discontinue, their, relations, with, the, cup, and, to, never, revive, the, party, despite, most, present, in, sivas, being, previous, members, it, was, also, decided, there, that, the, ottoman, empire, should, not, be, a, league, of, nations, mandate, under, the, united, states, especially, after, the, u, s, senate, failed, to, ratify, american, membership, in, the, league, momentum, was, now, on, the, nationalists, side, a, plot, by, a, loyalist, ottoman, governor, and, a, british, intelligence, officer, to,

october, 1919, ali, r, za, and, the, nationalists, held, negotiations, in, amasya, they, agreed, in, the, amasya, protocol, that, an, election, would, be, called, for, the, ottoman, parliament, to, establish, national, unity, by, upholding, the, resolutions, made, in, the, sivas, congress, including, the, national, pact, by, october, 1919, the, ottoman, government, only, held, de, facto, control, over, constantinople, the, rest, of, the, ottoman, empire, was, loyal, to, kemal, s, movement, to, resist, a, partition, of, anatolia, and, thrace, within, a, few, months, mustafa, kemal, went, from, general, inspector, of, the, ninth, army, to, a, renegade, military, commander, discharged, for, insubordination, to, leading, a, homegrown, anti, entente, movement, that, overthrew, a, government, and, driven, it, into, resistance, in, december, 1919, an, election, was, held, for, the, ottoman, parliament, with, polls, only, open, in, unoccupied, anatolia, and, thrace, it, was, boycotted, by, ottoman, greeks, ottoman, armenians, and, the, freedom, and, accord, party, resulting, in, groups, associated, with, the, turkish, nationalist, movement, winning, including, the, a, rmhc, the, nationalists, obvious, links, to, the, cup, made, the, election, especially, polarizing, and, voter, intimidation, and, ballot, box, stuffing, in, favor, of, the, kemalists, were, regular, occurrences, in, rural, provinces, this, controversy, led, to, many, of, the, nationalist, mps, organizing, the, national, salvation, group, separate, from, kemal, s, movement, which, risked, the, nationalist, movement, splitting, in, two, mustafa, kemal, was, elected, an, mp, from, erzurum, but, he, expected, the, allies, neither, to, accept, the, harbord, report, nor, to, respect, his, parliamentary, immunity, if, he, went, to, the, ottoman, capital, hence, he, remained, in, anatolia, mustafa, kemal, and, the, committee, of, representation, moved, from, sivas, to, ankara, so, that, he, could, keep, in, touch, with, as, many, deputies, as, possible, as, they, traveled, to, constantinople, to, attend, the, parliament, though, ali, r, za, pasha, called, the, election, as, per, the, amasya, protocol, to, keep, unity, between, the, istanbul, government, and, ankara, government, he, was, wrong, to, think, the, election, could, bring, him, any, legitimacy, the, ottoman, parliament, was, under, the, de, facto, control, of, the, british, battalion, stationed, at, constantinople, and, any, decisions, by, the, parliament, had, to, have, the, signatures, of, both, ali, r, za, pasha,

to, stay, in, the, empire, or, not, proposals, were, also, made, to, elect, kemal, president, of, the, chamber, however, this, was, deferred, in, the, certain, knowledge, that, the, british, would, prorogue, the, chamber, the, chamber, of, deputies, would, be, forcefully, dissolved, for, passing, the, national, pact, anyway, the, national, pact, solidified, nationalist, interests, which, were,

crisis, in, anatolia, the, british, began, to, sense, that, the, elected, ottoman, government, was, under, kemalist, influence, and, if, left, unchecked, the, entente, could, once, again, find, themselves, at, war, with, the, empire, the, ottoman, government, was, not, doing, all, that, it, could, to, suppress, the, nationalists, mustafa, kemal, manufactured, a, crisis, to, pressure, the,

growing, increasingly, concerned, about, the, turkish, national, movement, to, this, end, the, allied, occupational, authorities, in, istanbul, began, to, plan, a, raid, to, arrest, nationalist,

led, to, a, study, to, determine, what, would, be, required, to, defeat, the, turkish, nationalists, the, report, signed, by, french, field, marshal, ferdinand, foch, concluded, that, 27, divisions, were, necessary, but, the, british, army, did, not, have, 27, divisions, to, spare, also, a, deployment, of, this, size, could, have, disastrous, political, consequences, back, home, world, war, i, had, just, ended, and, the, british, public, would, not, support, another, lengthy, and, costly, expedition, the, british, accepted, the, fact, that, a, nationalist, movement, could, not, be, defeated, without, deployment, of, consistent, and, well, trained, forces, on, 25, june, the, forces, originating, from, kuva, i, nzibatiye, were, dismantled, under, british, supervision, the, british, realised, that, the, best, option, to, overcome, these, turkish, nationalists, was, to, use, a, force, that, was, battle, tested, and, fierce, enough, to, fight, the, turks, on, their, own, soil, the, british, had, to, look, no, further, than, turkey, s, neighbor, already, occupying, its, territory, greece, eleftherios, venizelos, pessimistic, of, the, rapidly, deteriorating, situation, in, anatolia, requested, to, the, allies, that, a, peace, treaty, be, drawn, up, with, the, hope, that, fighting, would, stop, the, subsequent, treaty, of, s, vres, in, august, 1920, confirmed, the, arab, provinces, of, the, empire, would, be, reorganized, into, new, nations, given, to, britain, and, france, in, the, form, of, mandates, by, the, league, of, nations, while, the, rest, of, the, empire, would, be, partitioned, between, greece, italy, france, via, syrian, mandate, britain, via, iraqi, mandate, armenia, potentially, under, an, american, mandate, and, georgia, smyrna, would, hold, a, plebiscite, on, whether, to, stay, with, greece, or, turkey, and, the, kurdistan, region, would, hold, one, on, the, question, of, independence, british, french, and, italian, spheres, of, influence, would, also, extend, into, anatolia, beyond, the, land, concessions, the, old, capital, of, constantinople, as, well, as, the, dardanelles, would, be, under, international, league, of, nations, control, however, the, treaty, could, never, come, into, effect, the, treaty, was, extremely, unpopular, with, protests, against, the, final, document, held, even, before, its, release, in, sultanahmet, square, though, mehmed, vi, and, ferid, pasha, loathed, the, treaty, they, did, not, want, istanbul, to, join, ankara, in, nationalist, struggle, the, ottoman, government, and, greece, never, ratified, it, though, ferid, pasha, signed, the, treaty, the, ottoman, senate, the, upper, house, with, seats, appointed, by, the, sultan, refused, to, ratify, the, treaty, greece, disagreed, on, the, borders, drawn, the, other, allies, began, to, fracture, their, support, of, the, settlement, immediately, italy, started, openly, supporting, the, nationalists, with, arms, by, the, end, of, 1920, and, the, french, signed, another, separate, peace, treaty, with, ankara, only, months, later, kemal, s, gna, government, responded, to, the, treaty, of, s, vres, by, promulgating, a, new, constitution, in, january, 1921, the, resulting, constitution, consecrated, the, principle, of, popular, sovereignty, authority, not, deriving, from, the, unelected, sultan, but, from, the, turkish, people, who, elect, governments, representative, of, their, interests, this, document, became, the, legal, basis, for, the, war, of, independence, by, the, gna, as, the, sultan, s, signature, of, the, treaty, of, s, vres, would, be, unconstitutional, as, his, position, was, not, elected, while, the, constitution, did, not, specify, a, future, role, of, the, sultan, the, document, gave, kemal, ever, more, legitimacy, in, the, eyes, of, turks, for, justified, resistance, against, istanbul, in, contrast, to, the, eastern, and, western, fronts, it, was, mostly, unorganized, kuva, yi, milliye, which, were, fighting, in, the, southern, front, against, france, they, had, help, from, the, syrians, who, were, fighting, their, own, war, with, the, french, the, british, troops, which, occupied, coastal,

occupation, force, consisted, of, the, french, armenian, legion, as, well, as, various, armenian, militia, groups, 150, 000, armenians, were, repatriated, to, their, homes, within, months, of, french, occupation, on, 21, january, 1920, a, turkish, nationalist, uprising, and, siege, occurred, against, the, french, garrison, in, marash, the, french, position, untenable, they, retreated, to, islahiye, resulting, in, a, massacre, of, many, armenians, by, turkish, militia, a, grueling, siege, followed, in, antep, which, featured, intense, sectarian, violence, between, turks, and, armenians, after, a, failed, uprising, by, the, nationalists, in, adana, by, 1921, the, french, and, turks, signed, an, armistice, and, eventually, a, treaty, was, brokered, demarcating, the, border, between, the, ankara, government, and, french, controlled, syria, in, the, end, there, was, a, mass, exodus, of, cilician, armenians, to, french, controlled, syria, previous, armenian, survivors, of, deportation, found, themselves, again, as, refugees, and, families, which, avoided, the, worst, of, the, six, years, violence, were, forced, from, their, homes, ending, thousands, of, years, of, christian, presence, in, southern, anatolia, with, france, being, the, first, allied, power, to, recognize, and, negotiate, with, the, ankara, government, only, months, after, signing, the, treaty, of, s, vres, it, was, the, first, to, break, from, the, coordinated, allied, approach, to, the, eastern, question, in, 1923, the, mandate, for, syria, and, the, lebanon, under, french, authority, would, be, proclaimed, in, former, ottoman, territory, some, efforts, to, coordinate, between, turkish, nationalists, and, the, syrian, rebels, persisted, from, 1920, to, 1921, with, the, nationalists, supporting, the, faisal, s, kingdom, through, ibrahim, hanunu, and, alawite, groups, which, were, also, fighting, the, french, while, the, french, conquered, syria, cilicia, had, to, be, abandoned, kuva, yi, milliye, also, engaged, with, british, forces, in, the, al, jazira, front, primarily, in, mosul, ali, hsan, pasha, sabis, and, his, forces, defending, mosul, would, surrender, to, the, british, in, october, 1918, but, the, british, ignored, the, armistice, and, seized, the, city, following, which, the, pasha, also, ignored, the, armistice, and, distributed, weapons, to, the, locals, even, before, mustafa,

should, not, be, the, only, occupation, force, in, this, area, admiral, bristol, was, not, so, sure, how, to, explain, this, annexation, to, u, s, president, woodrow, wilson, as, he, insisted, on, respect, for, nationalities, in, the, fourteen, points, he, believed, that, the, sentiments, of, the, turks, will, never, accept, this, annexation, neither, the, conference, of, london, nor, admiral,

represented, by, the, allies, the, british, still, expected, the, gna, to, make, concessions, from, the, first, speech, the, british, were, startled, as, ankara, demanded, fulfillment, of, the, national, pact, during, the, conference, the, british, troops, in, constantinople, were, preparing, for, a, kemalist, attack, there, was, never, any, fighting, in, thrace, as, greek, units, withdrew, before, the, turks, crossed, the, straits, from, asia, minor, the, only, concession, that, smet, made, to, the, british, was, an, agreement, that, his, troops, would, not, advance, any, farther, toward, the, dardanelles, which, gave, a, safe, haven, for, the, british, troops, as, long, as, the, conference, continued, the, conference, dragged, on, far, beyond, the, original, expectations, in, the, end, it, was, the, british, who, yielded, to, ankara, s, advances, the, armistice, of, mudanya, was, signed, on, 11, october, by, its, terms, the, greek, army, would, move, west, of, the, maritsa, clearing, eastern, thrace, to, the, allies, the, famous, american, author, ernest, hemingway, was, in, thrace, at, the, time, and, he, covered, the, evacuation, of, eastern, thrace, of, its,

capital, the, british, did, not, allow, the, hundred, gendarmes, who, came, with, him, that, resistance, lasted, until, the, next, day, kemal, had, long, ago, made, up, his, mind, to, abolish, the, sultanate, when, the, moment, was, ripe, after, facing, opposition, from, some, members, of, the, assembly, using, his, influence, as, a, war, hero, he, managed, to, prepare, a, draft, law, for, the, abolition, of, the, sultanate, which, was, then, submitted, to, the, national, assembly, for, voting, in, that, article, it, was, stated, that, the, form, of, the, government, in, constantinople, resting, on, the, sovereignty, of, an, individual, had, already, ceased, to, exist, when, the, british, forces, occupied, the, city, after, world, war, i, furthermore, it, was, argued, that, although, the, caliphate, had, belonged, to, the, ottoman, empire, it, rested, on, the, turkish, state, by, its, dissolution, and, turkish, national, assembly, would, have, right, to, choose, a, member, of, the, ottoman, family, in, the, office, of, caliph, on, 1, november, the, turkish, grand, national, assembly, voted, to, abolish, the, sultanate, mehmed, vi, fled, turkey, on, 17, november, 1922, on,

of, lausanne, began, on, 21, november, 1922, in, lausanne, switzerland, and, lasted, into, 1923, its, purpose, was, the, negotiation, of, a, treaty, to, replace, the, treaty, of, s, vres, which, under, the, new, government, of, the, grand, national, assembly, was, no, longer, recognised, by, turkey, smet, pasha, was, the, leading, turkish, negotiator, smet, maintained, the, basic, position, of, the, ankara, government, that, it, had, to, be, treated, as, an, independent, and, sovereign, state, equal, with, all, other, states, attending, the, conference, in, accordance, with, the, directives, of, mustafa, kemal, while, discussing, matters, regarding, the, control, of, turkish, finances, and, justice, the, capitulations, the, turkish, straits, and, the, like, he, refused, any, proposal, that, would, compromise, turkish, sovereignty, finally, after, long, debates, on, 24, july, 1923, the, treaty, of, lausanne, was, signed, ten, weeks, after, the, signature, the, allied, forces, left, istanbul, the, conference, opened, with, representatives, from, the, united, kingdom, france, italy, and, turkey, it, heard, speeches, from, benito, mussolini, of, italy, and, raymond, poincar, of, france, at, its, conclusion, turkey, assented, to, the, political, clauses, and, the, freedom, of, the, straits, which, was, britain, s, main, concern, the, matter, of, the, status, of, mosul, was, deferred, since, curzon, refused, to, be, budged, on, the, british, position, that, the, area, was, part, of, iraq, the, british, iraq, mandate, s, possession, of, mosul, was, confirmed, by, a, league, of, nations, brokered, agreement, between, turkey, and, great, britain, in, 1926, the, french, delegation, however, did, not, achieve, any, of, their, goals, and, on, 30, january, 1923, issued, a, statement, that, they, did, not, consider, the, draft, treaty, to, be, any, more, than, a, basis, of, discussion, the, turks, therefore, refused, to, sign, the, treaty, on, 4, february, 1923, curzon, made, a, final, appeal, to, smet, pasha, to, sign, and, when, he, refused, the, foreign, secretary, broke, off, negotiations, and, left, that, night, on, the, orient, express, the, treaty, of, lausanne, finally, signed, in, july, 1923, led, to, international, recognition, of, the, grand, national, assembly, as, the, legitimate, government, of, turkey, and, sovereignty, of, the, republic, of, turkey, as, the, successor, state, to, the, defunct, ottoman, empire, most, goals, on, the, condition, of, sovereignty, were, granted, to, turkey, in, addition, to, turkey, s, more, favourable, land, borders, compared, with, treaty, of, s, vres, as, can, be, seen, in, the, picture, to, the, right, capitulations, were, abolished, the, issue, of, mosul, would, be, decided, by, a, league, of, nations, plebiscite, in, 1926, while, the, border, with, greece, and, bulgaria, would, become, demilitarised, the, turkish, straits, would, be, under, an, international, commission, which, gave, turkey, more, of, a, voice, this, arrangement, would, be, replaced, by, the, montreux, convention, in, 1936, the, maritsa, meri, river, would, again, become, the, western, border, of, turkey, as, it, was, before, 1914, turkey, was, proclaimed, a, republic, on, 29, october, 1923, with, mustafa, kemal, pasha, was, elected, as, the, first, president, in, forming, his, government, he, placed, mustafa, fevzi, akmak, k, pr, l, k, z, m, zalp, and, smet, n, n, in, important, positions, they, helped, him, to, establish, his, subsequent, political, and, social, reforms, in, turkey, transforming, the, country, into, a, modern, and, secular, nation, state, the, orthodox, turkish, perspective, on, the, war, is, based, primarily, on, the, speeches, see, nutuk, and, narratives, of, mustafa, kemal, atat, rk, a, high, ranking, officer, in, world, war, i, and, the, leader, of, the, nationalist, movement, kemal, was, characterized, as, the, founder, and, sole, leader, of, the, nationalist, movement, potentially, negative, facts, were, omitted, in, the, orthodox, historiography, this, interpretation, had, a, tremendous, impact, on, the, perception, of, turkish, history, even, by, foreign, researchers, the, more, recent, historiography, has, come, to, understand, the, kemalist, version, as, a, nationalist, framing, of, events, and, movements, leading, to, the, republic, s, founding, this, was, accomplished, by, sidelining, unwanted, elements, which, had, links, to, the, detested, and, genocidal, cup, and, thus, elevating, kemal, and, his, policies, 805, 806, in, the, orthodox, turkish, version, of, events, the, nationalist, movement, broke, with, its, defective, past, and, took, its, strength, from, popular, support, led, by, kemal, consequently, giving, him, the, surname, atat, rk, meaning, father, of, turks, according, to, historians, such, as, donald, bloxham, e, j, z, rcher, and, taner, ak, am, this, was, not, the, case, in, reality, and, a, nationalist, movement, emerged, through, the, backing, of, leaders, of, cup, of, whom, many, were, war, criminals, people, who, became, wealthy, with, confiscated, equities, and, they, were, not, on, trial, for, their, crimes, owing, to, the, accelerating, support, for, the, national, movement, kemalist, figures, including, many, old, members, of, the, cup, ended, up, writing, the, majority, of, the, history, of, the, war, the, modern, understanding, in, turkey, is, greatly, influenced, by, this, nationalist, and, politically, motivated, history, 806, the, claim, that, the, nationalist, movement, emerged, as, a, continuation, of, the, cup, is, based, on, the, fact, nationalist, leaders, such, as, k, z, m, karabekir, and, fethi, okyar, had, been, former, members, of, the, committee, however, their, conduct, during, and, after, the, war, shows, that, various, movements, were, competing, with, each, other, kaz, m, karabekir, had, halil, kut, enver, pasha, s, uncle, deported, from, anatolia, during, the, war, suspecting, that, he, may, reorganize, the, cup, through, enver, pasha, s, directives, mustafa, kemal, appointed, ali, fuat, cebesoy, as, a, representative, to, moscow, after, learning, enver, pasha, was, lobbying, in, the, rsfsr, as, he, made, promises, to, return, anatolia, during, baku, congress, in, july, 1921, enver, pasha, organized, a, congress, in, batumi, for, former, cup, members, who, were, now, grand, national, assembly, deputies, they, intended, to, seize, power, and, expected, the, kemalists, would, lose, the, battle, of, the, sakarya, due, to, enver, s, leadership, of, the, basmachi, movement, and, djemal, s, visit, to, afghanistan, fahri, pasha, was, appointed, ambassador, to, afghanistan, to, minimize, their, efforts, turkey, and, afghanistan, signed, a, friendship, treaty, after, the, war, former, high, ranking, cup, members, were, semi, active, in, politics, until, they, were, purged, following, an, alleged, assassination, attempt, on, mustafa, kemal, s, life, former, finance, minister, mehmed, cavid, and, politician, ziya, hur, it, were, found, guilty, and, executed, and, former, members, like, k, z, m, karabekir, were, put, on, trial, but, acquitted, according, to, mesut, uyar, the, turkish, war, of, independence, was, also, a, civil, war, which, took, place, in, southern, marmara, western, and, eastern, black, sea, and, central, anatolia, regions, he, states, that, its, aspect, as, a, civil, war, is, pushed, into, the, background, in, official, and, academic, books, as, revolts, the, losers, of, civil, war, who, neither, supported, sultan, nor, ankara, government, which, they, considered, a, continuation, of, cup, did, not, consider, themselves, rebels, he, further, emphasizes, that, casualties, and, financial, losses, that, occurred, in, the, civil, war, is, at, least, as, catastrophic, as, the, war, that, was, fought, against, the, enemies, in, other, fronts, thus, he, concludes, that, the, war, was, similar, to, the, russian, revolution, preference, of, the, term, kurtulu, sava, lit, liberation, war, has, been, criticized, by, corry, guttstadt, as, it, causes, turkey, to, be, portrayed, as, a, victim, of, imperialist, forces, in, this, version, of, events, minority, groups, are, depicted, as, a, pawn, used, by, these, forces, turkish, islamists, right, wing, faction, and, also, leftists, regard, this, historical, narrative, to, be, legitimate, in, fact, ottoman, empire, had, joined, the, first, world, war, with, expansionist, goals, the, cup, government, intended, to, expand, the, empire, into, central, asia, when, they, were, defeated, however, they, depicted, themselves, as, the, victims, even, though, war, brought, dire, consequences, for, non, muslim, minorities, guttstadt, states, that, turkish, war, of, independence, which, was, conducted, against, armenian, and, greek, minorities, was, an, islamist, campaign, as, national, defense, committees, were, organizations, founded, with, islamist, characteristics, on, the, other, hand, the, embrace, of, the, turkish, war, of, independence, by, islamists, is, not, common, during, the, war, islamists, such, as, ottoman, shaykh, al, isl, m, mustafa, sabri, accused, the, ankara, based, nationalist, movement, of, being, a, rebellion, against, the, caliphate, and, the, monarchy, after, the, war, islamists, disturbed, by, mustafa, kemal, s, secularist, reforms, in, republican, turkey, put, forward, various, conspiracy, theories, to, try, to, discredit, both, the, war, and, kemal, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, turkish, side, however, from, the, turkish, perspective, the, term, kurtulu, sava, is, widely, defended, as, the, overwhelming, majority, of, turks, view, the, event, as, a, liberation, from, a, foreign, occupation, a, speech, delivered, by, mustafa, kemal, on, 24, april, 1920, to, the, newly, established, ankara, government, summed, up, the, turkish, perspective, of, the, situation, it, is, known, to, all, that, the, seat, of, the, caliphate, and, government, is, under, temporary, occupation, by, foreign, forces, and, that, our, independence, is, greatly, restricted, submitting, to, these, conditions, would, mean, national, acceptance, of, a, slavery, proposed, to, us, by, foreign, powers, the, treaty, of, s, vres, further, promoted, the, turkish, narrative, of, the, need, to, liberate, the, country, should, no, action, be, taken, the, turkish, state, would, be, reduced, to, rump, state, in, central, anatolia, under, heavy, foreign, influence, armenian, historian, richard, g, hovannisian, writes, that, the, italians, were, currying, favor, with, turkish, nationalist, forces, by, allowing, clandestine, sale, and, shipment, of, arms, to, them, historian, erik, sj, berg, concludes, that, it, seems, in, the, end, unlikely, that, the, turkish, nationalist, leaders, though, secular, in, name, ever, had, any, intention, of, allowing, any, sizeable, non, muslim, minority, to, remain, according, to, r, za, nur, one, of, the, turkish, delegates, at, lausanne, wrote, that, disposing, of, people, of, different, races, languages, and, religions, in, our, country, is, the, most, vital, issue, many, greek, men, were, conscripted, into, unarmed, labor, battalions, where, the, death, rate, sometimes, exceeded, 90, percent, raymond, k, vorkian, states, that, removing, non, turks, from, the, sanctuary, of, anatolia, continued, to, be, one, of, the, turkish, nationalists, main, activities, after, world, war, i, preventing, armenians, and, other, christians, from, returning, home, and, therefore, allowing, their, properties, to, be, retained, by, those, who, had, stolen, them, during, the, war, was, a, key, factor, in, securing, popular, support, for, the, turkish, nationalist, movement, christian, civilians, were, subjected, to, forced, deportation, to, expel, them, from, the, country, a, policy, that, continued, after, the, war, these, deportations, were, similar, to, those, employed, during, the, armenian, genocide, and, caused, many, deaths, over, 1, million, greeks, were, expelled, as, were, all, remaining, armenians, in, the, areas, of, diyarbekir, mardin, urfa, harput, and, malatia, forced, across, the, border, into, french, mandate, syria, vahagn, avedian, argues, that, the, turkish, war, of, independence, was, not, directed, against, the, allied, powers, but, that, its, main, objective, was, to, get, rid, of, non, turkish, minority, groups, the, nationalist, movement, maintained, the, aggressive, policy, of, the, cup, against, christians, it, was, stated, in, a, secret, telegram, from, foreign, minister, ahmet, muhtar, mollao, lu, to, kaz, m, karabekir, in, mid, 1921, the, most, important, thing, is, to, eliminate, armenia, both, politically, and, materially, avedian, holds, that, the, existence, of, the, armenian, republic, was, considered, as, the, greatest, threat, for, the, continuation, of, turkish, state, and, that, for, this, reason, they, fulfilled, the, genocidal, policy, of, its, cup, predecessor, after, the, christian, population, was, destroyed, the, focus, shifted, to, the, kurdish, population, ethnic, cleansing, was, also, carried, against, pontic, greeks, with, the, collaboration, with, ankara, and, istanbul, governments, the, grand, national, assembly, transitioned, from, a, provisional, counsel, to, being, turkey, s, primary, legislative, body, in, 1923, a, rmhc, changed, its, name, to, the, people, s, party, a, couple, years, later, the, name, would, be, changed, again, by, mustafa, kemal, to, the, republican, people, s, party, cumhuriyet, halk, partisi, chp, one, of, turkey, s, major, political, parties, as, well, as, its, oldest, chp, went, on, to, rule, turkey, as, a, one, party, state, until, the, 1946, general, election, in, addition, to, toppling, the, british, government, the, chanak, crisis, would, have, far, reaching, consequences, on, british, dominion, policy, as, the, dominion, of, canada, did, not, see, itself, committed, to, support, a, potential, british, war, with, kemal, s, gna, dominion, foreign, policy, would, become, less, committed, for, security, for, the, british, empire, this, attitude, of, no, commitment, to, the, empire, would, be, a, defining, moment, in, canada, s, gradual, movement, towards, independence, as, well, as, the, decline, of, the, british, empire, the, media, in, weimar, germany, covered, the, events, in, anatolia, extensively, ihrig, argues, that, turkish, war, of, independence, had, a, more, definite, impact, on, the, beer, hall, putsch, than, mussolini, s, march, on, rome, germans, including, adolf, hitler, wanted, to, abolish, the, treaty, of, versailles, just, like, the, treaty, of, s, vres, was, abolished, after, the, failed, putsch, media, coverage, on, the, war, ceased
