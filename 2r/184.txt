republic, was, established, c, 509, bc, when, the, last, of, the, seven, kings, of, rome, tarquin, the, proud, was, deposed, and, a, system, based, on, annually, elected, magistrates, and, various, representative, assemblies, was, established, a, constitution, set, a, series, of, checks, and, balances, and, a, separation, of, powers, the, most, important, magistrates, were, the, two, consuls, who, together, exercised, executive, authority, such, as, imperium, or, military, command, the, consuls, had, to, work, with, the, senate, which, was, initially, an, advisory, council, of, the, ranking, nobility, or, patricians, but, grew, in, size, and, power, other, magistrates, of, the, republic, include, tribunes, quaestors, aediles, praetors, and, censors, the, magistracies, were,

voted, on, matters, of, war, and, peace, and, elected, men, to, the, most, important, offices, and, the, comitia, tributa, tribal, assembly, which, elected, less, important, offices, in, the, 4th, century, bc, rome, had, come, under, attack, by, the, gauls, who, now, extended, their, power, in, the, italian, peninsula, beyond, the, po, valley, and, through, etruria, on, 16, july, 390, bc, a, gallic, army, under, the, leadership, of, tribal, chieftain, brennus, defeated, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, the, allia, and, marched, to, rome, the, gauls, looted, and, burned, the, city, then, laid, siege, to, the, capitoline, hill, where, some, romans, had, barricaded, themselves, for, seven, months, the, gauls, then, agreed, to, give, the, romans, peace, in, exchange, for, 1000, pounds, of, gold, according, to, later, legend, the, roman, supervising, the, weighing, noticed, that, the, gauls, were, using, false, scales, the, romans, then, took, up, arms, and, defeated, the, gauls, their, victorious, general, camillus, remarked, with, iron, not, with, gold, rome, buys, her, freedom, the, romans, gradually, subdued, the, other, peoples, on, the, italian, peninsula, including, the, etruscans, the, last, threat, to, roman, hegemony, in, italy, came, when, tarentum, a, major, greek, colony, enlisted, the, aid, of, pyrrhus, of, epirus, in, 281, bc, but, this, effort, failed, as, well, the, romans, secured, their, conquests, by, founding, roman, colonies, in, strategic, areas, thereby, establishing, stable, control, over, the, region, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, rome, faced, a, new, and, formidable, opponent, carthage, the, other, major, power, in, the, western, mediterranean, the, first, punic, war, began, in, 264, bc, when, the, city, of, messana, asked, for, carthage, s, help, in, their, conflicts, with, hiero, ii, of, syracuse, after, the, carthaginian, intercession, messana, asked, rome, to, expel, the, carthaginians, rome, entered, this, war, because, syracuse, and, messana, were, too, close, to, the, newly, conquered, greek, cities, of, southern, italy, and, carthage, was, now, able, to, make, an, offensive, through, roman, territory, along, with, this, rome, could, extend, its, domain, over, sicily, carthage, was, a, maritime, power, and, the, roman, lack, of, ships, and, naval, experience, made, the, path, to, the, victory, a, long, and, difficult, one, for, the, roman, republic, despite, this, after, more, than, 20, years, of, war, rome, defeated, carthage, and, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, among, the, reasons, for, the, second, punic, war, was, the, subsequent, war, reparations, carthage, acquiesced, to, at, the, end, of, the, first, punic, war, the, war, began, with, the, audacious, invasion, of, hispania, by, hannibal, who, marched, through, hispania, to, the, italian, alps, causing, panic, among, rome, s, italian, allies, the, best, way, found, to, defeat, hannibal, s, purpose, of, causing, the, italians, to, abandon, rome, was, to, delay, the, carthaginians, with, a, guerrilla, war, of, attrition, a, strategy, propounded, by, quintus, fabius, maximus, verrucosus, hannibal, s, invasion, lasted, over, 16, years, ravaging, italy, but, ultimately, carthage, was, defeated, in, the, decisive, battle, of, zama, in, october, 202, bc, more, than, a, half, century, after, these, events, carthage, was, left, humiliated, and, the, republic, s, focus, was, now, directed, towards, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, of, greece, and, revolts, in, hispania, however, carthage, having, paid, the, war, indemnity, felt, that, its, commitments, and, submission, to, rome, had, ceased, a, vision, not, shared, by, the, roman, senate, the, third, punic, war, began, when, rome, declared, war, against, carthage, in, 149, bc, carthage, resisted, well, at, the, first, strike, but, could, not, withstand, the, attack, of, scipio, aemilianus, who, entirely, destroyed, the, city, enslaved, all, the, citizens, and, gained, control, of, that, region, which, became, the, province, of, africa, all, these, wars, resulted, in, rome, s, first, overseas, conquests, sicily, hispania, and, africa, and, the, rise, of, rome, as, a, significant, imperial, power, after, defeating, the, macedonian, and, seleucid, empires, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, romans, became, the, dominant, people, of, the, mediterranean, sea, the, conquest, of, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, brought, the, roman, and, greek, cultures, in, closer, contact, and, the, roman, elite, once, rural, became, cosmopolitan, at, this, time, rome, was, a, consolidated, empire, in, the, military, view, and, had, no, major, enemies, foreign, dominance, led, to, internal, strife, senators, became, rich, at, the, provinces, expense, soldiers, who, were, mostly, small, scale, farmers, were, away, from, home, longer, and, could, not, maintain, their, land, and, the, increased, reliance, on, foreign, slaves, and, the, growth, of, latifundia, reduced, the, availability, of, paid, work, income, from, war, booty, mercantilism, in, the, new, provinces, and, tax, farming, created, new, economic, opportunities, for, the, wealthy, forming, a, new, class, of, merchants, called, the, equestrians, the, lex, claudia, forbade, members, of, the, senate, from, engaging, in, commerce, so, while, the, equestrians, could, theoretically, join, the, senate, they, were, severely, restricted, in, political, power, the, senate, squabbled, perpetually, repeatedly, blocked, important, land, reforms, and, refused, to, give, the, equestrian, class, a, larger, say, in, the, government, violent, gangs, of, the, urban, unemployed, controlled, by, rival, senators, intimidated, the, electorate, through, violence, the, situation, came, to, a, head, in, the, late, 2nd, century, bc, under, the, gracchi, brothers, a, pair, of, tribunes, who, attempted, to, pass, land, reform, legislation, that, would, redistribute, the, major, patrician, landholdings, among, the, plebeians, both, brothers, were, killed, and, the, senate, passed, reforms, reversing, the, gracchi, brother, s, actions, this, led, to, the, growing, divide, of, the, plebeian, groups, populares, and, equestrian, classes, optimates, gaius, marius, soon, become, a, leader, of, the, republic, holding, the, first, of, his, seven, consulships, an, unprecedented, number, in, 107, bc, by, arguing, that, his, former, patron, quintus, caecilius, metellus, numidicus, was, not, able, to, defeat, and, capture, the, numidian, king, jugurtha, marius, then, started, his, military, reform, in, his, recruitment, to, fight, jugurtha, he, levied, the, very, poor, an, innovation, and, many, landless, men, entered, the, army, marius, was, elected, for, five, consecutive, consulships, from, 104, to, 100, bc, as, rome, needed, a, military, leader, to, defeat, the, cimbri, and, the, teutones, who, were, threatening, rome, after, marius, s, retirement, rome, had, a, brief, peace, during, which, the, italian, socii, allies, in, latin, requested, roman, citizenship, and, voting, rights, the, reformist, marcus, livius, drusus, supported, their, legal, process, but, was, assassinated, and, the, socii, revolted, against, the, romans, in, the, social, war, at, one, point, both, consuls, were, killed, marius, was, appointed, to, command, the, army, together, with, lucius, julius, caesar, and, lucius, cornelius, sulla, by, the, end, of, the, social, war, marius, and, sulla, were, the, premier, military, men, in, rome, and, their, partisans, were, in, conflict, both, sides, jostling, for, power, in, 88, bc, sulla, was, elected, for, his, first, consulship, and, his, first, assignment, was, to, defeat, mithridates, vi, of, pontus, whose, intentions, were, to, conquer, the, eastern, part, of, the, roman, territories, however, marius, s, partisans, managed, his, installation, to, the, military, command, defying, sulla, and, the, senate, to, consolidate, his, own, power, sulla, conducted, a, surprising, and, illegal, action, he, marched, to, rome, with, his, legions, killing, all, those, who, showed, support, to, marius, s, cause, in, the, following, year, 87, bc, marius, who, had, fled, at, sulla, s, march, returned, to, rome, while, sulla, was, campaigning, in, greece, he, seized, power, along, with, the, consul, lucius, cornelius, cinna, and, killed, the, other, consul, gnaeus, octavius, achieving, his, seventh, consulship, marius, and, cinna, revenged, their, partisans, by, conducting, a, massacre, marius, died, in, 86, bc, due, to, age, and, poor, health, just, a, few, months, after, seizing, power, cinna, exercised, absolute, power, until, his, death, in, 84, bc, after, returning, from, his, eastern, campaigns, sulla, had, a, free, path, to, reestablish, his, own, power, in, 83, bc, he, made, his, second, march, on, rome, and, began, a, time, of, terror, thousands, of, nobles, knights, and, senators, were, executed, sulla, held, two, dictatorships, and, one, more, consulship, which, began, the, crisis, and, decline, of, roman, republic, in, the, mid, 1st, century, bc, roman, politics, were, restless, political, divisions, in, rome, split, into, one, of, two, groups, populares, who, hoped, for, the, support, of, the, people, and, optimates, the, best, who, wanted, to, maintain, exclusive, aristocratic, control, sulla, overthrew, all, populist, leaders, and, his, constitutional, reforms, removed, powers, such, as, those, of, the, tribune, of, the, plebs, that, had, supported, populist, approaches, meanwhile, social, and, economic, stresses, continued, to, build, rome, had, become, a, metropolis, with, a, super, rich, aristocracy, debt, ridden, aspirants, and, a, large, proletariat, often, of, impoverished, farmers, the, latter, groups, supported, the, catilinarian, conspiracy, a, resounding, failure, since, the, consul, marcus, tullius, cicero, quickly, arrested, and, executed, the, main, leaders, gaius, julius, caesar, reconciled, the, two, most, powerful, men, in, rome, marcus, licinius, crassus, who, had, financed, much, of, his, earlier, career, and, crassus, rival, gnaeus, pompeius,

stopped, by, legal, means, pompey, s, party, tried, to, strip, caesar, of, his, legions, a, prelude, to, caesar, s, trial, impoverishment, and, exile, to, avoid, this, fate, caesar, crossed, the, rubicon, river, and, invaded, rome, in, 49, bc, the, battle, of, pharsalus, was, a, brilliant, victory, for, caesar, and, in, this, and, other, campaigns, he, destroyed, all, of, the, optimates,

assassination, caused, political, and, social, turmoil, in, rome, the, city, was, ruled, by, his, friend, and, colleague, marcus, antonius, soon, afterward, octavius, whom, caesar, adopted, through, his, will, arrived, in, rome, octavian, historians, regard, octavius, as, octavian, due, to, the, roman, naming, conventions, tried, to, align, himself, with, the, caesarian, faction, in, 43, bc, along, with, antony, and, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, caesar, s, best, friend, he, legally, established, the, second, triumvirate, upon, its, formation, 130, 300, senators, were, executed, and, their,

was, living, in, ptolemaic, egypt, ruled, by, his, lover, cleopatra, vii, antony, s, affair, with, cleopatra, was, seen, as, an, act, of, treason, since, she, was, queen, of, another, country, additionally, antony, adopted, a, lifestyle, considered, too, extravagant, and, hellenistic, for, a, roman, statesman, following, antony, s, donations, of, alexandria, which, gave, to, cleopatra, the,

last, emperor, of, the, western, empire, instead, of, romulus, augustus, after, 1200, years, of, independence, and, nearly, 700, years, as, a, great, power, the, rule, of, rome, in, the, west, ended, various, reasons, for, rome, s, fall, have, been, proposed, ever, since, including, loss, of, republicanism, moral, decay, military, tyranny, class, war, slavery, economic, stagnation, environmental, change, disease, the, decline, of, the, roman, race, as, well, as, the, inevitable, ebb, and, flow, that, all, civilisations, experience, the, eastern, empire, survived, for, almost, 1000, years, after, the, fall, of, its, western, counterpart, and, became, the, most, stable, christian, realm, during, the, middle, ages, during, the, 6th, century, justinian, reconquered, the, italian, peninsula, from, the, ostrogoths, north, africa, from, the, vandals, and, southern, hispania, from, the, visigoths, but, within, a, few, years, of, justinian, s, death, eastern, roman, byzantine, possessions, in, italy, were, greatly, reduced, by, the, lombards, who, settled, in, the, peninsula, in, the, east, partially, due, to, the, weakening, effect, of, the, plague, of, justinian, as, well, as, a, series, of, mutually, destructive, wars, against, the, persian, sassanian, empire, the, byzantine, romans, were, threatened, by, the, rise, of, islam, its, followers, rapidly, brought, about, the, conquest, of, the, levant, the, conquest, of, armenia, and, the, conquest, of, egypt, during, the, arab, byzantine, wars, and, soon, presented, a, direct, threat, to, constantinople, in, the, following, century, the, arabs, captured, southern, italy, and, sicily, in, the, west, slavic, populations, penetrated, deep, into, the, balkans, the, byzantine, romans, however, managed, to, stop, further, islamic, expansion, into, their, lands, during, the, 8th, century, and, beginning, in, the, 9th, century, reclaimed, parts, of, the, conquered, lands, in, 1000, ad, the, eastern, empire, was, at, its, height, basil, ii, reconquered, bulgaria, and, armenia, and, culture, and, trade, flourished, however, soon, after, this, expansion, was, abruptly, stopped, in, 1071, with, the, byzantine, defeat, in, the, battle, of, manzikert, the, aftermath, of, this, battle, sent, the, empire, into, a, protracted, period, of, decline, two, decades, of, internal, strife, and, turkic, invasions, ultimately, led, emperor, alexios, i, komnenos, to, send, a, call, for, help, to, the, western, european, kingdoms, in, 1095, the, west, responded, with, the, crusades, eventually, resulting, in, the, sack, of, constantinople, by, participants, of, the, fourth, crusade, the, conquest, of, constantinople, in, 1204, fragmented, what, remained, of, the, empire, into, successor, states, the, ultimate, victor, was, the, empire, of, nicaea, after, the, recapture, of, constantinople, by, imperial, forces, the, empire, was, little, more, than, a, greek, state, confined, to, the, aegean, coast, the, eastern, roman, byzantine, empire, collapsed, when, mehmed, the, conqueror, conquered, constantinople, on, 29, may, 1453, the, imperial, city, of, rome, was, the, largest, urban, center, in, the, empire, with, a, population, variously, estimated, from, 450, 000, to, close, to, one, million, around, 20, per, cent, of, the, population, under, jurisdiction, of, ancient, rome, 25, 40, depending, on, the, standards, used, in, roman, italy, lived, in, innumerable, urban, centers, with, population, of, 10, 000, and, more, and, several, military, settlements, a, very, high, rate, of, urbanisation, by, pre, industrial, standards, most, of, those, centers, had, a, forum, temples, and, other, buildings, similar, to, rome, s, the, average, life, expectancy, in, the, middle, empire, was, about, 26, 28, years, the, roots, of, the, legal, principles, and, practices, of, the, ancient, romans, may, be, traced, to, the, law, of, the, twelve, tables, promulgated, in, 449, bc, and, to, the, codification, of, law, issued, by, order, of, emperor, justinian, i, around, 530, ad, see, corpus, juris, civilis, roman, law, as, preserved, in, justinian, s, codes, continued, into, the, byzantine, roman, empire, and, formed, the, basis, of, similar, codifications, in, continental, western, europe, roman, law, continued, in, a, broader, sense, to, be, applied, throughout, most, of, europe, until, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, the, major, divisions, of, the, law, of, ancient, rome, as, contained, within, the, justinian, and, theodosian, law, codes, consisted, of, jus, civile, jus, gentium, and, jus, naturale, the, jus, civile, citizen, law, was, the, body, of, common, laws, that, applied, to, roman, citizens, the, praetores, urbani, sg, praetor, urbanus, were, the, people, who, had, jurisdiction, over, cases, involving, citizens, the, jus, gentium, law, of, nations, was, the, body, of, common, laws, that, applied, to, foreigners, and, their, dealings, with, roman, citizens, the, praetores, peregrini, sg, praetor, peregrinus, were, the, people, who, had, jurisdiction, over, cases, involving, citizens, and, foreigners, jus, naturale, encompassed, natural, law, the, body, of, laws, that, were, considered, common, to, all, beings, roman, society, is, largely, viewed, as, hierarchical, with, slaves, servi, at, the, bottom, freedmen, liberti, above, them, and, free, born, citizens, cives, at, the, top, free, citizens, were, subdivided, by, class, the, broadest, and, earliest, division, was, between, the, patricians, who, could, trace, their, ancestry, to, one, of, the, 100, patriarchs, at, the, founding, of, the, city, and, the, plebeians, who, could, not, this, became, less, important, in, the, later, republic, as, some, plebeian, families, became, wealthy, and, entered, politics, and, some, patrician, families, fell, economically, anyone, patrician, or, plebeian, who, could, count, a, consul, as, his, ancestor, was, a, noble, nobilis, a, man, who, was, the, first, of, his, family, to, hold, the, consulship, such, as, marius, or, cicero, was, known, as, a, novus, homo, new, man, and, ennobled, his, descendants, patrician, ancestry, however, still, conferred, considerable, prestige, and, many, religious, offices, remained, restricted, to, patricians, a, class, division, originally, based, on, military, service, became, more, important, membership, of, these, classes, was, determined, periodically, by, the, censors, according, to, property, the, wealthiest, were, the, senatorial, class, who, dominated, politics, and, command, of, the, army, next, came, the, equestrians, equites, sometimes, translated, knights, originally, those, who, could, afford, a, warhorse, and, who, formed, a, powerful, mercantile, class, several, further, classes, originally, based, on, the, military, equipment, their, members, could, afford, followed, with, the, proletarii, citizens, who, had, no, property, other, than, their, children, at, the, bottom, before, the, reforms, of, marius, they, were, ineligible, for, military, service, and, are, often, described, as, being, just, above, freed, slaves, in, wealth, and, prestige, voting, power, in, the, republic, depended, on, class, citizens, were, enrolled, in, voting, tribes, but, the, tribes, of, the, richer, classes, had, fewer, members, than, the, poorer, ones, all, the, proletarii, being, enrolled, in, a, single, tribe, voting, was, done, in, class, order, from, top, down, and, stopped, as, soon, as, most, of, the, tribes, had, been, reached, so, the, poorer, classes, were, often, unable, to, cast, their, votes, women, in, ancient, rome, shared, some, basic, rights, with, their, male, counterparts, but, were, not, fully, regarded, as, citizens, and, were, thus, not, allowed, to, vote, or, take, part, in, politics, at, the, same, time, the, limited, rights, of, women, were, gradually, expanded, due, to, emancipation, and, women, reached, freedom, from, pater, familias, gained, property, rights, and, even, had, more, juridical, rights, than, their, husbands, but, still, no, voting, rights, and, were, absent, from, politics, allied, foreign, cities, were, often, given, the, latin, rights, an, intermediary, level, between, full, citizens, and, foreigners, peregrini, which, gave, their, citizens, rights, under, roman, law, and, allowed, their, leading, magistrates, to, become, full, roman, citizens, while, there, were, varying, degrees, of, latin, rights, the, main, division, was, between, those, cum, suffragio, with, vote, enrolled, in, a, roman, tribe, and, able, to, take, part, in, the, comitia, tributa, and, sine, suffragio, without, vote, could, not, take, part, in, roman, politics, most, of, rome, s, italian, allies, were, given, full, citizenship, after, the, social, war, of, 91, 88, bc, and, full, roman, citizenship, was, extended, to, all, free, born, men, in, the, empire, by, caracalla, in, 212, with, the, exception, of, the, dediticii, people, who, had, become, subject, to, rome, through, surrender, in, war, and, freed, slaves, in, the, early, republic, there, were, no, public, schools, so, boys, were, taught, to, read, and, write, by, their, parents, or, by, educated, slaves, called, paedagogi, usually, of, greek, origin, the, primary, aim, of, education, during, this, period, was, to, train, young, men, in, agriculture, warfare, roman, traditions, and, public, affairs, young, boys, learned, much, about, civic, life, by, accompanying, their, fathers, to, religious, and, political, functions, including, the, senate, for, the, sons, of, nobles, the, sons, of, nobles, were, apprenticed, to, a, prominent, political, figure, at, the, age, of, 16, and, campaigned, with, the, army, from, the, age, of, 17, educational, practices, were, modified, after, the, conquest, of, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, the, resulting, greek, influence, although, roman, educational, practices, were, still, much, different, from, greek, ones, if, their, parents, could, afford, it, boys, and, some, girls, at, the, age, of, 7, were, sent, to, a, private, school, outside, the, home, called, a, ludus, where, a, teacher, called, a, litterator, or, a, magister, ludi, and, often, of, greek, origin, taught, them, basic, reading, writing, arithmetic, and, sometimes, greek, until, the, age, of, 11, beginning, at, age, 12, students, went, to, secondary, schools, where, the, teacher, now, called, a, grammaticus, taught, them, about, greek, and, roman, literature, at, the, age, of, 16, some, students, went, on, to, rhetoric, school, where, the, teacher, usually, greek, was, called, a, rhetor, education, at, this, level, prepared, students, for, legal, careers, and, required, that, the, students, memorise, the, laws, of, rome, initially, rome, was, ruled, by, kings, who, were, elected, from, each, of, rome, s, major, tribes, in, turn, the, exact, nature, of, the, king, s, power, is, uncertain, he, may, have, held, near, absolute, power, or, may, have, merely, been, the, chief, executive, of, the, senate, and, the, people, in, military, matters, the, king, s, authority, imperium, was, likely, absolute, he, was, also, the, head, of, the, state, religion, in, addition, to, the, authority, of, the, king, there, were, three, administrative, assemblies, the, senate, which, acted, as, an, advisory, body, for, the, king, the, comitia, curiata, which, could, endorse, and, ratify, laws, suggested, by, the, king, and, the, comitia, calata, which, was, an, assembly, of, the, priestly, college, that, could, assemble, the, people, to, bear, witness, to, certain, acts, hear, proclamations, and, declare, the, feast, and, holiday, schedule, for, the, next, month, the, class, struggles, of, the, roman, republic, resulted, in, an, unusual, mixture, of, democracy, and, oligarchy, the, word, republic, comes, from, the, latin, res, publica, which, literally, translates, to, public, business, roman, laws, traditionally, could, only, be, passed, by, a, vote, of, the, popular, assembly, comitia, tributa, likewise, candidates, for, public, positions, had, to, run, for, election, by, the, people, however, the, roman, senate, represented, an, oligarchic, institution, which, acted, as, an, advisory, body, in, the, republic, the, senate, held, actual, authority, auctoritas, but, no, real, legislative, power, it, was, technically, only, an, advisory, council, however, as, the, senators, were, individually, very, influential, it, was, difficult, to, accomplish, anything, against, the, collective, will, of, the, senate, new, senators, were, chosen, from, among, the, most, accomplished, patricians, by, censors, censura, who, could, also, remove, a, senator, from, his, office, if, he, was, found, morally, corrupt, a, charge, that, could, include, bribery, or, as, under, cato, the, elder, embracing, one, s, wife, in, public, later, under, the, reforms, of, the, dictator, sulla, quaestors, were, made, automatic, members, of, the, senate, though, most, of, his, reforms, did, not, survive, the, republic, had, no, fixed, bureaucracy, and, collected, taxes, through, the, practice, of, tax, farming, government, positions, such, as, quaestor, aedile, or, praefect, were, funded, by, the, office, holder, to, prevent, any, citizen, from, gaining, too, much, power, new, magistrates, were, elected, annually, and, had, to, share, power, with, a, colleague, for, example, under, normal, conditions, the, highest, authority, was, held, by, two, consuls, in, an, emergency, a, temporary, dictator, could, be, appointed, throughout, the, republic, the, administrative, system, was, revised, several, times, to, comply, with, new, demands, in, the, end, it, proved, inefficient, for, controlling, the, ever, expanding, dominion, of, rome, contributing, to, the, establishment, of, the, roman, empire, in, the, early, empire, the, pretense, of, a, republican, form, of, government, was, maintained, the, roman, emperor, was, portrayed, as, only, a, princeps, or, first, citizen, and, the, senate, gained, legislative, power, and, all, legal, authority, previously, held, by, the, popular, assemblies, however, the, rule, of, the, emperors, became, increasingly, autocratic, and, the, senate, was, reduced, to, an, advisory, body, appointed, by, the, emperor, the, empire, did, not, inherit, a, set, bureaucracy, from, the, republic, since, the, republic, did, not, have, any, permanent, governmental, structures, apart, from, the, senate, the, emperor, appointed, assistants, and, advisers, but, the, state, lacked, many, institutions, such, as, a, centrally, planned, budget, some, historians, have, cited, this, as, a, significant, reason, for, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, the, early, roman, army, c, 500, bc, was, like, those, of, other, contemporary, city, states, influenced, by, greek, civilisation, a, citizen, militia, that, practised, hoplite, tactics, it, was, small, and, organised, in, five, classes, in, parallel, to, the, comitia, centuriata, the, body, of, citizens, organised, politically, with, three, providing, hoplites, and, two, providing, light, infantry, the, early, roman, army, was, tactically, limited, and, its, stance, during, this, period, was, essentially, defensive, by, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, romans, abandoned, the, hoplite, formation, in, favour, of, a, more, flexible, system, in, which, smaller, groups, of, 120, or, sometimes, 60, men, called, maniples, could, manoeuvre, more, independently, on, the, battlefield, thirty, maniples, arranged, in, three, lines, with, supporting, troops, constituted, a, legion, totalling, between, 4, 000, and, 5, 000, men, the, early, republican, legion, consisted, of, five, sections, the, three, lines, of, manipular, heavy, infantry, hastati, principes, and, triarii, a, force, of, light, infantry, velites, and, the, cavalry, equites, with, the, new, organisation, came, a, new, orientation, toward, the, offensive, and, a, much, more, aggressive, posture, toward, adjoining, city, states, at, nominal, full, strength, an, early, republican, legion, included, 3, 600, to, 4, 800, heavy, infantry, several, hundred, light, infantry, and, several, hundred, cavalrymen, until, the, late, republican, period, the, typical, legionary, was, a, property, owning, citizen, farmer, from, a, rural, area, an, adsiduus, who, served, for, particular, often, annual, campaigns, and, who, supplied, his, own, equipment, after, 200, bc, economic, conditions, in, rural, areas, deteriorated, as, manpower, needs, increased, so, that, the, property, qualifications, for, compulsory, service, were, gradually, reduced, beginning, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, legionaries, were, paid, a, stipend, stipendium, by, the, time, of, augustus, the, ideal, of, the, citizen, soldier, had, been, abandoned, and, the, legions, had, become, fully, professional, at, the, end, of, the, civil, war, augustus, reorganised, roman, military, forces, discharging, soldiers, and, disbanding, legions, he, retained, 28, legions, distributed, through, the, provinces, of, the, empire, during, the, principate, the, tactical, organisation, of, the, army, continued, to, evolve, the, auxilia, remained, independent, cohorts, and, legionary, troops, often, operated, as, groups, of, cohorts, rather, than, as, full, legions, a, new, and, versatile, type, of, unit, the, cohortes, equitatae, combined, cavalry, and, legionaries, in, a, single, formation, they, could, be, stationed, at, garrisons, or, outposts, and, could, fight, on, their, own, as, balanced, small, forces, or, combine, with, similar, units, as, a, larger, legion, sized, force, this, increase, in, organizational, flexibility, helped, ensure, the, long, term, success, of, roman, military, forces, the, emperor, gallienus, 253, 268, ad, began, a, reorganisation, that, created, the, last, military, structure, of, the, late, empire, withdrawing, some, legionaries, from, the, fixed, bases, on, the, border, gallienus, created, mobile, forces, the, comitatenses, or, field, armies, and, stationed, them, behind, and, at, some, distance, from, the, borders, as, a, strategic, reserve, the, border, troops, limitanei, stationed, at, fixed, bases, continued, to, be, the, first, line, of, defence, the, basic, units, of, the, field, army, were, regimental, legiones, or, auxilia, for, infantry, and, vexillationes, for, cavalry, nominal, strengths, may, have, been, 1, 200, men, for, infantry, regiments, and, 600, for, cavalry, but, actual, troop, levels, could, have, been, much, lower, 800, infantry, and, 400, cavalry, many, infantry, and, cavalry, regiments, operated, in, pairs, under, the, command, of, a, comes, field, armies, included, regiments, recruited, from, allied, tribes, and, known, as, foederati, by, 400, ad, foederati, regiments, had, become, permanently, established, units, of, the, roman, army, paid, and, equipped, by, the, empire, led, by, a, roman, tribune, and, used, just, as, roman, units, were, used, the, empire, also, used, groups, of, barbarians, to, fight, along, with, the, legions, as, allies, without, integration, into, the, field, armies, under, overall, command, of, a, roman, general, but, led, by, their, own, officers, military, leadership, evolved, over, the, course, of, the, history, of, rome, under, the, monarchy, the, hoplite, armies, were, led, by, the, kings, during, the, early, and, middle, roman, republic, military, forces, were, under, the, command, of, one, of, the, two, elected, consuls, for, the, year, during, the, later, republic, members, of, the, roman, senatorial, elite, as, part, of, the, normal, sequence, of, elected, public, offices, known, as, the, cursus, honorum, would, have, served, first, as, quaestor, often, posted, as, deputies, to, field, commanders, then, as, praetor, following, the, end, of, a, term, as, praetor, or, consul, a, senator, might, be, appointed, by, the, senate, as, a, propraetor, or, proconsul, depending, on, the, highest, office, held, before, to, govern, a, foreign, province, under, augustus, whose, most, important, political, priority, was, to, place, the, military, under, a, permanent, and, unitary, command, the, emperor, was, the, legal, commander, of, each, legion, but, exercised, that, command, through, a, legatus, legate, he, appointed, from, the, senatorial, elite, in, a, province, with, a, single, legion, the, legate, commanded, the, legion, legatus, legionis, and, served, as, provincial, governor, while, in, a, province, with, more, than, one, legion, each, legion, was, commanded, by, a, legate, and, the, legates, were, commanded, by, the, provincial, governor, also, a, legate, but, of, higher, rank, during, the, later, stages, of, the, imperial, period, beginning, perhaps, with, diocletian, the, augustan, model, was, abandoned, provincial, governors, were, stripped, of, military, authority, and, command, of, the, armies, in, a, group, of, provinces, was, given, to, generals, duces, appointed, by, the, emperor, these, were, no, longer, members, of, the, roman, elite, but, men, who, came, up, through, the, ranks, and, had, seen, much, practical, soldiering, with, increasing, frequency, these, men, attempted, sometimes, successfully, to, usurp, the, positions, of, the, emperors, decreased, resources, increasing, political, chaos, and, civil, war, eventually, left, the, western, empire, vulnerable, to, attack, and, takeover, by, neighbouring, barbarian, peoples, less, is, known, about, the, roman, navy, than, the, roman, army, prior, to, the, middle, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, officials, known, as, duumviri, navales, commanded, a, fleet, of, twenty, ships, used, mainly, to, control, piracy, this, fleet, was, given, up, in, 278, ad, and, replaced, by, allied, forces, the, first, punic, war, required, that, rome, build, large, fleets, and, it, did, so, largely, with, the, assistance, of, and, financing, from, allies, this, reliance, on, allies, continued, to, the, end, of, the, roman, republic, the, quinquereme, was, the, main, warship, on, both, sides, of, the, punic, wars, and, remained, the, mainstay, of, roman, naval, forces, until, replaced, by, the, time, of, caesar, augustus, by, lighter, and, more, manoeuvrable, vessels, as, compared, with, a, trireme, the, quinquereme, permitted, the, use, of, a, mix, of, experienced, and, inexperienced, crewmen, an, advantage, for, a, primarily, land, based, power, and, its, lesser, manoeuvrability, permitted, the, romans, to, adopt, and, perfect, boarding, tactics, using, a, troop, of, about, 40, marines, in, lieu, of, the, ram, ships, were, commanded, by, a, navarch, a, rank, equal, to, a, centurion, who, was, usually, not, a, citizen, potter, suggests, that, because, the, fleet, was, dominated, by, non, romans, the, navy, was, considered, non, roman, and, allowed, to, atrophy, in, times, of, peace, information, suggests, that, by, the, time, of, the, late, empire, 350, ad, the, roman, navy, comprised, several, fleets, including, warships, and, merchant, vessels, for, transportation, and, supply, warships, were, oared, sailing, galleys, with, three, to, five, banks, of, oarsmen, fleet, bases, included, such, ports, as, ravenna, arles, aquilea, misenum, and, the, mouth, of, the, somme, river, in, the, west, and, alexandria, and, rhodes, in, the, east, flotillas, of, small, river, craft, classes, were, part, of, the, limitanei, border, troops, during, this, period, based, at, fortified, river, harbours, along, the, rhine, and, the, danube, that, prominent, generals, commanded, both, armies, and, fleets, suggests, that, naval, forces, were, treated, as, auxiliaries, to, the, army, and, not, as, an, independent, service, the, details, of, command, structure, and, fleet, strengths, during, this, period, are, not, well, known, although, fleets, were, commanded, by, prefects, ancient, rome, commanded, a, vast, area, of, land, with, tremendous, natural, and, human, resources, as, such, rome, s, economy, remained, focused, on, farming, and, trade, agricultural, free, trade, changed, the, italian, landscape, and, by, the, 1st, century, bc, vast, grape, and, olive, estates, had, supplanted, the, yeoman, farmers, who, were, unable, to, match, the, imported, grain, price, the, annexation, of, egypt, sicily, and, tunisia, in, north, africa, provided, a, continuous, supply, of, grains, in, turn, olive, oil, and, wine, were, italy, s, main, exports, two, tier, crop, rotation, was, practised, but, farm, productivity, was, low, around, 1, ton, per, hectare, industrial, and, manufacturing, activities, were, small, the, largest, such, activities, were, the, mining, and, quarrying, of, stones, which, provided, basic, construction, materials, for, the, buildings, of, that, period, in, manufacturing, production, was, on, a, relatively, small, scale, and, generally, consisted, of, workshops, and, small, factories, that, employed, at, most, dozens, of, workers, however, some, brick, factories, employed, hundreds, of, workers, the, economy, of, the, early, republic, was, largely, based, on, smallholding, and, paid, labour, however, foreign, wars, and, conquests, made, slaves, increasingly, cheap, and, plentiful, and, by, the, late, republic, the, economy, was, largely, dependent, on, slave, labour, for, both, skilled, and, unskilled, work, slaves, are, estimated, to, have, constituted, around, 20, of, the, roman, empire, s, population, at, this, time, and, 40, in, the, city, of, rome, only, in, the, roman, empire, when, the, conquests,

connected, military, posts, where, roman, markets, were, centered, these, roads, were, designed, for, wheels, as, a, result, there, was, transport, of, commodities, between, roman, regions, but, increased, with, the, rise, of, roman, maritime, trade, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, during, that, period, a, trading, vessel, took, less, than, a, month, to, complete, a, trip, from, gades, to, alexandria, via, ostia, spanning, the, entire, length, of, the, mediterranean, transport, by, sea, was, around, 60, times, cheaper, than, by, land, so, the, volume, for, such, trips, was, much, larger, some, economists, consider, the, roman, empire, a, market, economy, similar, in, its, degree, of, capitalistic, practices, to, 17th, century, netherlands, and, 18th, century, england, the, basic, units, of, roman, society, were, households, and, families, groups, of, households, connected, through, the, male, line, formed, a, family, gens, based, on, blood, ties, a, common, ancestry, or, adoption, during, the, roman, republic, some, powerful, families, or, gentes, maiores, came, to, dominate, political, life, families, were, headed, by, their, oldest, male, citizen, the, pater,

extreme, expressions, of, this, power, the, selling, or, killing, of, family, members, for, moral, or, civil, offences, including, simple, disobedience, were, very, rarely, exercised, and, were, forbidden, in, the, imperial, era, a, pater, familias, had, moral, and, legal, duties, towards, all, family, members, even, the, most, despotic, pater, familias, was, expected, to, consult, senior, members, of, his, household, and, gens, over, matters, that, affected, the, family, s, well, being, and, reputation, traditionally, such, matters, were, regarded, as, outside, the, purview, of, the,

child, abandoned, children, were, sometimes, adopted, some, would, have, been, sold, into, slavery, slavery, was, near, ubiquitous, and, almost, universally, accepted, in, the, early, republic, citizens, in, debt, were, allowed, to, sell, their, labour, and, perhaps, their, sons, to, their, debtor, in, a, limited, form, of, slavery, called, nexum, but, this, was, abolished, in, the, middle, republic, freedom, was, considered, a, natural, and, proper, state, for, citizens, slaves, could, be, lawfully, freed, with, consent, and, support, of, their, owners, and, still, serve, their, owners,

society, in, law, a, pater, familias, held, potestas, over, his, adult, sons, with, their, own, households, this, could, give, rise, to, legal, anomalies, such, as, adult, sons, also, having, the, status, of, minors, no, man, could, be, considered, a, pater, familias, nor, could, he, truly, hold, property, under, law, while, his, own, father, lived, during, rome, s, early, history, married, daughters, came, under, the, control, manus, of, their, husbands, pater, familias, by, the, late, republic, most, married, women, retained, lawful, connection, to, their, birth, family, though, any,

beginning, the, 12, month, calendar, still, in, use, today, in, 44, bc, the, month, quintilis, was, renamed, to, julius, july, after, julius, caesar, and, in, 8, bc, sextilis, was, renamed, to, augustus, august, after, augustus, caesar, the, romans, had, several, ways, of, tracking, years, one, widespread, way, was, the, consular, dating, which, identified, years, by, the, two, consuls, who, ruled, each, year, another, way, introduced, in, the, late, 3rd, century, ad, was, counting, years, from, the, indictio, a, 15, year, period, based, on, the, announcement, of, the, delivery, of, food, and, other, goods, to, the, government, another, way, less, popular, but, more, similar, to, present, day, was, ab, urbe, condita, which, counted, years, from, the, mythical, foundation, of, rome, in, 753, bc, life, in, ancient, rome, revolved, around, the, city, of, rome, located, on, seven, hills, the, city, had, a, vast, number, of, monumental, structures, like, the, colosseum, the, trajan, s, forum, and, the, pantheon, it, had, theatres, gymnasiums, marketplaces, functional, sewers, bath, complexes, complete, with, libraries, and, shops, and, fountains, with, fresh, drinking, water, supplied, by, hundreds, of, miles, of, aqueducts, throughout, the, territory, under, the, control, of, ancient, rome, residential, architecture, ranged, from, modest, houses, to, country, villas, in, the, capital, city, of, rome, there, were, imperial, residences, on, the, elegant, palatine, hill, from, which, the, word, palace, derives, the, low, plebeian, and, middle, equestrian, classes, lived, in, the, city, center, packed, into, apartments, or, insulae, which, were, almost, like, modern, ghettos, these, areas, often, built, by, upper, class, property, owners, to, rent, were, often, centred, upon, collegia, or, taberna, these, people, provided, with, a, free, supply, of, grain, and, entertained, by, gladiatorial, games, were, enrolled, as, clients, of, patrons, among, the, upper, class, patricians, whose, assistance, they, sought, and, whose, interests, they, upheld, the, native, language, of, the, romans, was, latin, an, italic, language, the, grammar, of, which, relies, little, on, word, order, conveying, meaning, through, a, system, of, affixes, attached, to, word, stems, its, alphabet, was, based, on, the, etruscan, alphabet, which, was, in, turn, based, on, the, greek, alphabet, although, surviving, latin, literature, consists, almost, entirely, of, classical, latin, an, artificial, and, highly, stylised, and, polished, literary, language, from, the, 1st, century, bc, the, spoken, language, of, the, roman, empire, was, vulgar, latin, which, significantly, differed, from, classical, latin, in, grammar, and, vocabulary, and, eventually, in, pronunciation, speakers, of, latin, could, understand, both, until, the, 7th, century, when, spoken, latin, began, to, diverge, so, much, that, classical, or, good, latin, had, to, be, learned, as, a, second, language, while, latin, remained, the, main, written, language, of, the, roman, empire, greek, came, to, be, the, language, spoken, by, the, well, educated, elite, as, most, of, the, literature, studied, by, romans, was, written, in, greek, most, of, the, emperors, were, bilingual, but, had, a, preference, for, latin, in, the, public, sphere, for, political, reasons, a, practice, that, first, started, during, the, punic, wars, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, roman, empire, and, later, the, eastern, roman, empire, latin, was, never, able, to, replace, greek, a, legacy, of, the, hellenistic, period, justinian, would, be, the, last, emperor, to, use, latin, in, government, and, marks, when, greek, officially, took, over, the, expansion, of, the, roman, empire, spread, latin, throughout, europe, and, vulgar, latin, evolved, into, many, distinct, romance, languages, archaic, roman, religion, at, least, concerning, the, gods, was, made, up, not, of, written, narratives, but, rather, of, complex, interrelations, between, gods, and, humans, unlike, in, greek, mythology, the, gods, were, not, personified, but, were, vaguely, defined, sacred, spirits, called, numina, romans, also, believed, that, every, person, place, or, thing, had, its, own, genius, or, divine, soul, during, the, roman, republic, roman, religion, was, organised, under, a, strict, system, of, priestly, offices, which, were, held, by, men, of, senatorial, rank, the, college, of, pontifices, was, uppermost, body, in, this, hierarchy, and, its, chief, priest, the, pontifex, maximus, was, the, head, of, the, state, religion, flamens, took, care, of, the, cults, of, various, gods, while, augurs, were, trusted, with, taking, the, auspices, the, sacred, king, took, on, the, religious, responsibilities, of, the, deposed, kings, in, the, roman, empire, deceased, emperors, who, had, ruled, well, were, deified, by, their, successors, and, the, senate, and, the, formalised, imperial, cult, became, increasingly, prominent, as, contact, with, the, greeks, increased, the, old, roman, gods, became, increasingly, associated, with, greek, gods, under, the, empire, the, romans, absorbed, the, mythologies, of, their, conquered, subjects, often, leading, to, situations, in, which, the, temples, and, priests, of, traditional, italian, deities, existed, side, by, side, with, those, of, foreign, gods, beginning, with, emperor, nero, in, the, 1st, century, ad, roman, official, policy, towards, christianity, was, negative, and, at, some, point, being, a, christian, could, be, punishable, by, death, under, emperor, diocletian, the, persecution, of, christians, reached, its, peak, however, it, became, an, officially, supported, religion, in, the, roman, state, under, diocletian, s, successor, constantine, i, with, the, signing, of, the, edict, of, milan, in, 313, and, quickly, became, dominant, all, religions, except, christianity, were, prohibited, in, 391, ad, by, an, edict, of, emperor, theodosius, i, like, many, ancient, cultures, concepts, of, ethics, and, morality, while, sharing, some, commonalities, with, modern, society, differed, greatly, in, several, important, ways, because, ancient, civilisations, like, rome, were, under, constant, threat, of, attack, from, marauding, tribes, their, culture, was, necessarily, militaristic, with, martial, skills, being, a, prized, attribute, whereas, modern, societies, consider, compassion, a, virtue, roman, society, considered, compassion, a, vice, a, moral, defect, indeed, one, of, the, primary, purposes, of, the, gladiatorial, games, was, to, inoculate, roman, citizens, from, this, weakness, romans, instead, prized, virtues, such, as, courage, and, conviction, virtus, a, sense, of, duty, to, one, s, people, moderation, and, avoiding, excess, moderatio, forgiveness, and, understanding, clementia, fairness, severitas, and, loyalty, pietas, roman, society, had, well, established, and, restrictive, norms, related, to, sexuality, though, as, with, many, societies, the, lion, s, share, of, the, responsibilities, fell, on, women, women, were, generally, expected, to, be, monogamous, having, only, a, single, husband, during, their, life, univira, though, this, was, much, less, regarded, by, the, elite, especially, under, the, empire, women, were, expected, to, be, modest, in, public, avoiding, any, provocative, appearance, and, to, demonstrate, absolute, fidelity, to, their, husbands, pudicitia, indeed, wearing, a, veil, was, a, common, expectation, to, preserve, modesty, sex, outside, of, marriage, was, generally, frowned, upon, for, men, and, women, and, indeed, was, made, illegal, during, the, imperial, period, nevertheless, prostitution, was, an, accepted, and, regulated, practice, public, demonstrations, of, death, violence, and, brutality, were, used, as, a, source, of, entertainment, in, roman, communities, however, it, was, also, a, way, to, maintain, social, order, demonstrate, power, and, signify, communal, unity, roman, painting, styles, show, greek, influences, and, surviving, examples, are, primarily, frescoes, used, to, adorn, the, walls, and, ceilings, of, country, villas, though, roman, literature, includes, mentions, of, paintings, on, wood, ivory, and, other, materials, several, examples, of, roman, painting, have, been, found, at, pompeii, and, from, these, art, historians, divide, the, history, of, roman, painting, into, four, periods, the, first, style, of, roman, painting, was, practised, from, the, early, 2nd, century, bc, to, the, early, or, mid, 1st, century, bc, it, was, mainly, composed, of, imitations, of, marble, and, masonry, though, sometimes, including, depictions, of, mythological, characters, the, second, style, began, during, the, early, 1st, century, bc, and, attempted, to, depict, realistically, three, dimensional, architectural, features, and, landscapes, the, third, style, occurred, during, the, reign, of, augustus, 27, bc, 14, ad, and, rejected, the, realism, of, the, second, style, in, favour, of, simple, ornamentation, a, small, architectural, scene, landscape, or, abstract, design, was, placed, in, the, center, with, a, monochrome, background, the, fourth, style, which, began, in, the, 1st, century, ad, depicted, scenes, from, mythology, while, retaining, architectural, details, and, abstract, patterns, portrait, sculpture, used, youthful, and, classical, proportions, evolving, later, into, a, mixture, of, realism, and, idealism, during, the, antonine, and, severan, periods, ornate, hair, and, bearding, with, deep, cutting, and, drilling, became, popular, advancements, were, also, made, in, relief, sculptures, usually, depicting, roman, victories, roman, music, was, largely, based, on, greek, music, and, played, an, important, part, in, many, aspects, of, roman, life, in, the, roman, military, musical, instruments, such, as, the, tuba, a, long, trumpet, or, the, cornu, were, used, to, give, various, commands, while, the, buccina, possibly, a, trumpet, or, horn, and, the, lituus, probably, an, elongated, j, shaped, instrument, were, used, in, ceremonial, capacities, music, was, used, in, the, roman, amphitheatres, between, fights, and, in, the, odea, and, in, these, settings, is, known, to, have, featured, the, cornu, and, the, hydraulis, a, type, of, water, organ, most, religious, rituals, featured, musical, performances, some, music, historians, believe, that, music, was, used, at, almost, all, public, ceremonies, the, graffiti, brothels, paintings, and, sculptures, found, in, pompeii, and, herculaneum, suggest, that, the, romans, had, a, sex, saturated, culture, latin, literature, was, from, its, start, influenced, heavily, by, greek, authors, some, of, the, earliest, extant, works, are, of, historical, epics, telling, the, early, military, history, of, rome, as, the, republic, expanded, authors, began, to, produce, poetry, comedy, history, and, tragedy, ancient, rome, s, literary, contributions, are, still, recognized, today, and, the, works, by, ancient, roman, authors, were, available, in, bookshops, as, well, as, in, public, and, private, libraries, many, scholars, and, statesmen, of, ancient, rome, cultivated, private, libraries, that, were, used, both, as, demonstrations, of, knowledge, and, displays, of, wealth, and, power, private, libraries, were, so, commonly, encountered, that, vitruvius, wrote, about, where, libraries, should, be, situated, within, a, villa, in, addition, to, numerous, private, libraries, the, roman, empire, saw, the, establishment, of, early, public, libraries, although, julius, caesar, had, intended, to, establish, public, libraries, to, further, establish, rome, as, a, great, cultural, center, like, athens, and, alexandria, he, died, before, this, was, accomplished, caesar, s, former, lieutenant, gaius, asinius, pollio, took, up, the, project, and, opened, the, first, public, library, in, rome, in, the, atrium, libertatis, emperors, augustus, tiberius, vespasian, domitian, and, trajan, also, founded, or, expanded, public, libraries, in, rome, during, their, reigns, these, included, the, ulpian, library, in, trajan, s, forum, and, libraries, in, the, temple, of, apollo, palatinus, the, temple, of, peace, in, the, roman, forum, the, temple, of, divus, augustus, which, was, dedicated, to, minerva, when, it, was, rebuilt, under, emperor, domitian, s, orders, some, of, these, including, the, library, at, the, temple, of, divus, augustus, also, served, as, archives, by, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, city, of, rome, had, more, than, two, dozen, public, libraries, rome, was, not, the, only, city, to, benefit, from, such, institutions, as, the, roman, empire, spread, public, libraries, were, established, in, other, major, cities, and, cultural, centers, including, ephesos, athens, and, timgad, most, public, libraries, of, this, time, were, not, built, expressly, for, that, purpose, instead, sharing, space, in, temples, baths, and, other, community, buildings, in, addition, to, serving, as, repositories, for, books, public, libraries, hosted, orations, by, authors, these, recitations, served, as, social, gatherings, and, allowed, those, who, may, not, be, literate, to, be, entertained, by, poetry, epics,

wider, range, of, foods, thus, it, gradually, shifted, to, the, evening, while, the, vesperna, was, abandoned, completely, over, the, course, of, the, years, the, mid, day, meal, prandium, became, a, light, meal, to, hold, one, over, until, cena, the, toga, a, common, garment, during, the, era, of, julius, caesar, was, gradually, abandoned, by, all, social, classes, of, the, empire, at, the,

years, of, the, western, roman, empire, was, the, pallium, which, was, mostly, worn, by, philosophers, and, scholars, in, general, due, to, external, influences, mainly, from, the, germanic, peoples,
