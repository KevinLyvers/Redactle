restoration, and, the, boshin, war, which, restored, imperial, rule, to, japan, a, revolution, took, place, from, the, time, of, the, kamakura, shogunate, which, existed, with, the, tenn, s, court, to, the, tokugawa, when, the, samurai, became, the, unchallenged, rulers, in, what, historian, edwin, o, reischauer, called, a, centralized, feudal, form, of, the, shogunate, instrumental, in, the, rise, of, the, new, bakufu, was, tokugawa, ieyasu, the, main, beneficiary, of, the, achievements, of, oda, nobunaga, and, toyotomi, hideyoshi, already, a, powerful, daimyo, feudal, lord, ieyasu, profited, by, his, transfer, to, the, rich, kant, area, he, maintained, two, million, koku, or, thirty, six, hectares, of, land, a, new, headquarters, at, edo, a, strategically, situated, castle, town, the, future, tokyo, and, also, had, an, additional, two, million, koku, of, land, and, thirty, eight, vassals, under, his, control, after, hideyoshi, s, death, ieyasu, moved, quickly, to, seize, control, of, the, toyotomi, clan, ieyasu, s, victory, over, the, western, daimyo, at, the, battle, of, sekigahara, october, 21, 1600, or, in, the, old, japanese, calendar, on, the, 15th, day, of, the, ninth, month, of, the, fifth, year, of, the, keich, era, gave, him, control, of, all, japan, he, rapidly, abolished, numerous, enemy, daimyo, houses, reduced, others, such, as, that, of, the, toyotomi, and, redistributed, the, spoils, of, war, to, his, family, and, allies, ieyasu, still, failed, to, achieve, complete, control, of, the, western, daimyo, but, his, assumption, of, the, title, of, sh, gun, helped, consolidate, the, alliance, system, after, further, strengthening, his, power, base, ieyasu, installed, his, son, hidetada, 1579, 1632, as, sh, gun, and, himself, as, retired, sh, gun, in, 1605, the, toyotomi, were, still, a, significant, threat, and, ieyasu, devoted, the, next, decade, to, their, eradication, in, 1615, the, tokugawa, army, destroyed, the, toyotomi, stronghold, at, osaka, the, tokugawa, or, edo, period, brought, 250, years, of, stability, to, japan, the, political, system, evolved, into, what, historians, call, bakuhan, a, combination, of, the, terms, bakufu, and, han, domains, to, describe, the, government, and, society, of, the, period, in, the, bakuhan, the, sh, gun, had, national, authority, and, the, daimyo, had, regional, authority, this, represented, a, new, unity, in, the, feudal, structure, which, featured, an, increasingly, large, bureaucracy, to, administer, the, mixture, of, centralized, and, decentralized, authorities, the, tokugawa, became, more, powerful, during, their, first, century, of, rule, land, redistribution, gave, them, nearly, seven, million, koku, control, of, the, most, important, cities, and, a, land, assessment, system, reaping, great, revenues, the, feudal, hierarchy, was, completed, by, the, various, classes, of, daimyo, closest, to, the, tokugawa, house, were, the, shinpan, or, related, houses, there, were, twenty, three, daimyo, on, the, borders, of, tokugawa, lands, all, directly, related, to, ieyasu, the, shinpan, held, mostly, honorary, titles, and, advisory, posts, in, the, bakufu, the, second, class, of, the, hierarchy, was, the, fudai, or, house, daimyo, rewarded, with, lands, close, to, the, tokugawa, holdings, for, their, faithful, service, by, the, 18th, century, 145, fudai, controlled, much, smaller, han, the, greatest, assessed, at, 250, 000, koku, members, of, the, fudai, class, staffed, most, of, the, major, bakufu, offices, ninety, seven, han, formed, the, third, group, the, tozama, outside, vassals, former, opponents, or, new, allies, the, tozama, were, located, mostly, on, the, peripheries, of, the, archipelago, and, collectively, controlled, nearly, ten, million, koku, of, productive, land, because, the, tozama, were, the, least, trusted, of, the, daimyo, they, were, the, most, cautiously, managed, and, generously, treated, although, they, were, excluded, from, central, government, positions, the, tokugawa, shogunate, not, only, consolidated, their, control, over, a, reunified, japan, but, also, had, unprecedented, power, over, the, emperor, the, court, all, daimyo, and, the, religious, orders, the, emperor, was, held, up, as, the, ultimate, source, of, political, sanction, for, the, sh, gun, who, ostensibly, was, the, vassal, of, the, imperial, family, the, tokugawa, helped, the, imperial, family, recapture, its, old, glory, by, rebuilding, its, palaces, and, granting, it, new, lands, to, ensure, a, close, tie, between, the, imperial, clan, and, the, tokugawa, family, ieyasu, s, granddaughter, was, made, an, imperial, consort, in, 1619, a, code, of, laws, was, established, to, regulate, the, daimyo, houses, the, code, encompassed, private, conduct, marriage, dress, types, of, weapons, and, numbers, of, troops, allowed, required, feudal, lords, to, reside, in, edo, every, other, year, the, sankin, k, tai, system, prohibited, the, construction, of, ocean, going, ships, restricted, castles, to, one, per, domain, han, and, stipulated, that, bakufu, regulations, were, the, national, law, although, the, daimyo, were, not, taxed, per, se, they, were, regularly, levied, for, contributions, to, military, and, logistical, support, and, for, public, works, such, as, projects, as, castles, roads, bridges, and, palaces, the, various, regulations, and, levies, not, only, strengthened, the, tokugawa, but, also, depleted, the, wealth, of, the, daimyo, thus, weakening, their, threat, to, the, central, administration, the, han, once, military, centered, domains, became, mere, local, administrative, units, the, daimyo, had, full, administrative, control, over, their, territory, and, their, complex, systems, of, retainers, bureaucrats, and, commoners, loyalty, was, exacted, from, religious, foundations, already, greatly, weakened, by, nobunaga, and, hideyoshi, through, a, variety, of, control, mechanisms, like, hideyoshi, ieyasu, encouraged, foreign, trade, but, also, was, suspicious, of, outsiders, he, wanted, to, make, edo, a, major, port, but, once, he, learned, that, the, europeans, favoured, ports, in, ky, sh, and, that, china, had, rejected, his, plans, for, official, trade, he, moved, to, control, existing, trade, and, allowed, only, certain, ports, to, handle, specific, kinds, of, commodities, the, beginning, of, the, edo, period, coincides, with, the, last, decades, of, the, nanban, trade, period, during, which, intense, interaction, with, european, powers, on, the, economic, and, religious, plane, took, place, it, is, at, the, beginning, of, the, edo, period, that, japan, built, its, first, ocean, going, warships, such, as, the, san, juan, bautista, a, 500, ton, galleon, type, ship, that, transported, a, japanese, embassy, headed, by, hasekura, tsunenaga, to, the, americas, and, then, to, europe, also, during, that, period, the, bakufu, commissioned, around, 720, red, seal, ships, three, masted, and, armed, trade, ships, for, intra, asian, commerce, japanese, adventurers, such, as, yamada, nagamasa, used, those, ships, throughout, asia, the, christian, problem, was, in, effect, a, problem, of, controlling, both, the, christian, daimyo, in, ky, sh, and, their, trade, with, the, europeans, by, 1612, the, sh, gun, s, retainers, and, residents, of, tokugawa, lands, had, been, ordered, to, forswear, christianity, more, restrictions, came, in, 1616, the, restriction, of, foreign, trade, to, nagasaki, and, hirado, an, island, northwest, of, ky, sh, 1622, the, execution, of, 120, missionaries, and, converts, 1624, the, expulsion, of, the, spanish, and, 1629, the, execution, of, thousands, of, christians, finally, the, closed, country, edict, of, 1635, prohibited, any, japanese, from, travelling, outside, japan, or, if, someone, left, from, ever, returning, in, 1636, the, dutch, were, restricted, to, dejima, a, small, artificial, island, and, thus, not, true, japanese, soil, in, nagasaki, s, harbor, the, shogunate, perceived, christianity, to, be, an, extremely, destabilizing, factor, and, so, decided, to, target, it, the, shimabara, rebellion, of, 1637, 1638, in, which, discontented, catholic, samurai, and, peasants, rebelled, against, the, bakufu, and, edo, called, in, dutch, ships, to, bombard, the, rebel, stronghold, marked, the, end, of, the, christian, movement, during, the, shimabara, rebellion, an, estimated, 37, 000, people, mostly, christians, were, massacred, in, 50, years, the, tokugawa, shoguns, reduced, the, amount, of, christians, to, near, zero, in, japan, some, christians, survived, by, going, underground, the, so, called, kakure, kirishitan, soon, thereafter, the, portuguese, were, permanently, expelled, members, of, the, portuguese, diplomatic, mission, were, executed, all, japanese, subjects, were, ordered, to, register, at, a, buddhist, or, shinto, temple, the, dutch, and, chinese, were, restricted, respectively, to, dejima, and, to, a, special, quarter, in, nagasaki, besides, small, trade, of, some, outer, daimyo, with, korea, and, the, ryukyu, islands, to, the, southwest, of, japan, s, main, islands, by, 1641, foreign, contacts, were, limited, by, the, policy, of, sakoku, to, nagasaki, the, last, jesuit, was, either, killed, or, reconverted, by, 1644, by, the, 1660s, christianity, was, almost, completely, eradicated, its, external, political, economic, and, religious, influence, on, japan, became, quite, limited, only, china, the, dutch, east, india, company, and, for, a, short, period, the, portuguese, spanish, and, english, enjoyed, the, right, to, visit, japan, during, this, period, for, commercial, purposes, only, and, they, were, restricted, to, the, dejima, port, in, nagasaki, other, europeans, who, landed, on, japanese, shores, were, put, to, death, without, trial, during, the, tokugawa, period, the, social, order, based, on, inherited, position, rather, than, personal, merits, was, rigid, and, highly, formalized, at, the, top, were, the, emperor, and, court, nobles, kuge, together, with, the, sh, gun, and, daimyo, older, scholars, believed, that, there, were, shi, n, k, sh, four, classes, of, samurai, peasants, hyakush, craftsmen, and, merchants, ch, nin, under, the, daimyo, with, 80, of, peasants, under, the, 5, samurai, class, followed, by, craftsmen, and, merchants, however, various, studies, have, revealed, since, about, 1995, that, the, classes, of, peasants, craftsmen, and, merchants, under, the, samurai, are, equal, and, the, old, hierarchy, chart, has, been, removed, from, japanese, history, textbooks, in, other, words, peasants, craftsmen, and, merchants, are, not, a, social, pecking, order, but, a, social, classification, only, the, peasants, lived, in, rural, areas, samurai, craftsmen, and, merchants, lived, in, the, cities, that, were, built, around, daimyo, castles, each, restricted, to, their, own, quarter, edo, society, had, an, elaborate, social, structure, in, which, every, family, knew, its, place, and, level, of, prestige, at, the, top, were, the, emperor, and, the, court, nobility, invincible, in, prestige, but, weak, in, power, next, came, the, sh, gun, daimyo, and, layers, of, feudal, lords, whose, rank, was, indicated, by, their, closeness, to, the, tokugawa, they, had, power, the, daimyo, comprised, about, 250, local, lords, of, local, han, with, annual, outputs, of, 50, 000, or, more, bushels, of, rice, the, upper, strata, was, much, given, to, elaborate, and, expensive, rituals, including, elegant, architecture, landscaped, gardens, noh, drama, patronage, of, the, arts, and, the, tea, ceremony, then, came, the, 400, 000, warriors, called, samurai, in, numerous, grades, and, degrees, a, few, upper, samurai, were, eligible, for, high, office, most, were, foot, soldiers, since, there, was, very, little, fighting, they, became, civil, servants, paid, by, the, daimyo, with, minor, duties, the, samurai, were, affiliated, with, senior, lords, in, a, well, established, chain, of, command, the, shogun, had, 17, 000, samurai, retainers, the, daimyo, each, had, hundreds, most, lived, in, modest, homes, near, their, lord, s, headquarters, and, lived, off, of, hereditary, rights, and, stipends, together, these, high, status, groups, comprised, japan, s, ruling, class, making, up, about, 6, of, the, total, population, after, a, long, period, of, inner, conflict, the, first, goal, of, the, newly, established, tokugawa, government, was, to, pacify, the, country, it, created, a, balance, of, power, that, remained, fairly, stable, for, the, next, 250, years, influenced, by, confucian, principles, of, social, order, most, samurai, lost, their, direct, possession, of, the, land, the, daimyo, took, over, their, land, the, samurai, had, a, choice, give, up, their, sword, and, become, peasants, or, move, to, the, city, of, their, feudal, lord, and, become, a, paid, retainer, only, a, few, land, samurai, remained, in, the, border, provinces, of, the, north, or, as, direct, vassals, of, the, sh, gun, the, 5, 000, so, called, hatamoto, the, daimyo, were, put, under, tight, control, of, the, shogunate, their, families, had, to, reside, in, edo, the, daimyo, themselves, had, to, reside, in, edo, for, one, year, and, in, their, province, han, for, the, next, this, system, was, called, sankin, k, tai, lower, orders, divided, into, two, main, segments, the, peasants, 80, of, the, population, whose, high, prestige, as, producers, was, undercut, by, their, burden, as, the, chief, source, of, taxes, they, were, illiterate, and, lived, in, villages, controlled, by, appointed, officials, who, kept, the, peace, and, collected, taxes, the, family, was, the, smallest, legal, entity, and, the, maintenance, of, family, status, and, privileges, was, of, great, importance, at, all, levels, of, society, the, individual, had, no, separate, legal, rights, the, 1711, got, ke, reij, was, compiled, from, over, 600, statutes, promulgated, between, 1597, and, 1696, outside, the, four, classes, were, the, so, called, eta, and, hinin, those, whose, professions, broke, the, taboos, of, buddhism, eta, were, butchers, tanners, and, undertakers, hinin, served, as, town, guards, street, cleaners, and, executioners, other, outsiders, included, the, beggars, entertainers, and, prostitutes, the, word, eta, literally, translates, to, filthy, and, hinin, to, non, humans, a, thorough, reflection, of, the, attitude, held, by, other, classes, that, the, eta, and, hinin, were, not, even, people, hinin, were, only, allowed, inside, a, special, quarter, of, the, city, other, persecution, of, the, hinin, included, disallowing, them, from, wearing, robes, longer, than, knee, length, and, the, wearing, of, hats, sometimes, eta, villages, were, not, even, printed, on, official, maps, a, sub, class, of, hinin, who, were, born, into, their, social, class, had, no, option, of, mobility, to, a, different, social, class, whereas, the, other, class, of, hinin, who, had, lost, their, previous, class, status, could, be, reinstated, in, japanese, society, on, the, other, hand, in, practice, both, eta, and, hinin, were, recognized, as, owners, of, fields, some, with, very, large, incomes, koku, and, some, economic, power, their, chief, held, the, title, of, danzaemon, ja, and, had, the, authority, to, issue, orders, to, eta, and, hinin, throughout, the, country, as, well, as, jurisdiction, within, the, eta, and, hinin, in, the, 19th, century, the, umbrella, term, burakumin, was, coined, to, name, the, eta, and, hinin, because, both, classes, were, forced, to, live, in, separate, village, neighborhoods, the, eta, hinin, and, burakumin, classes, were, officially, abolished, in, 1871, however, their, cultural, and, societal, impact, including, some, forms, of, discrimination, continues, into, modern, times, the, edo, period, passed, on, a, vital, commercial, sector, to, be, in, flourishing, urban, centers, a, relatively, well, educated, elite, a, sophisticated, government, bureaucracy, productive, agriculture, a, closely, unified, nation, with, highly, developed, financial, and, marketing, systems, and, a, national, infrastructure, of, roads, economic, development, during, the, tokugawa, period, included, urbanization, increased, shipping, of, commodities, a, significant, expansion, of, domestic, and, initially, foreign, commerce, and, a, diffusion, of, trade, and, handicraft, industries, the, construction, trades, flourished, along, with, banking, facilities, and, merchant, associations, increasingly, han, authorities, oversaw, the, rising, agricultural, production, and, the, spread, of, rural, handicrafts, by, the, mid, 18th, century, edo, had, a, population, of, more, than, one, million, likely, the, biggest, city, in, the, world, at, the, time, osaka, and, kyoto, each, had, more, than, 400, 000, inhabitants, many, other, castle, towns, grew, as, well, osaka, and, kyoto, became, busy, trading, and, handicraft, production, centers, while, edo, was, the, center, for, the, supply, of, food, and, essential, urban, consumer, goods, around, the, year, 1700, japan, was, perhaps, the, most, urbanized, country, in, the, world, at, a, rate, of, around, 10, 12, half, of, that, figure, would, be, samurai, while, the, other, half, consisting, of, merchants, and, artisans, would, be, known, as, ch, nin, in, the, first, part, of, the, edo, period, japan, experienced, rapid, demographic, growth, before, leveling, off, at, around, 30, million, between, the, 1720s, and, 1820s, japan, had, almost, zero, population, growth, often, attributed, to, lower, birth, rates, in, response, to, widespread, famine, great, tenmei, famine, 1782, 1788, but, some, historians, have, presented, different, theories, such, as, a, high, rate, of, infanticide, artificially, controlling, population, at, around, 1721, the, population, of, japan, was, close, to, 30, million, and, the, figure, was, only, around, 32, million, around, the, meiji, restoration, around, 150, years, later, from, 1721, there, were, regular, national, surveys, of, the, population, until, the, end, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, in, addition, regional, surveys, as, well, as, religious, records, initially, compiled, to, eradicate, christianity, also, provide, valuable, demographic, data, the, tokugawa, era, brought, peace, and, that, brought, prosperity, to, a, nation, of, 31, million, 80, of, them, rice, farmers, rice, production, increased, steadily, but, population, remained, stable, rice, paddies, grew, from, 1, 6, million, ch, in, 1600, to, 3, million, by, 1720, improved, technology, helped, farmers, control, the, all, important, flow, of, water, to, their, paddies, the, daimyos, operated, several, hundred, castle, towns, which, became, loci, of, domestic, trade, the, system, of, sankin, k, tai, meant, that, daimyos, and, their, families, often, resided, in, edo, or, travelled, back, to, their, domains, giving, demand, to, an, enormous, consumer, market, in, edo, and, trade, throughout, the, country, samurai, and, daimyos, after, prolonged, peace, were, accustomed, to, more, elaborate, lifestyles, to, keep, up, with, growing, expenditures, the, bakufu, and, daimyos, often, encouraged, commercial, crops, and, artifacts, within, their, domains, from, textiles, to, tea, the, concentration, of, wealth, also, led, to, the, development, of, financial, markets, as, the, shogunate, only, allowed, daimyos, to, sell, surplus, rice, in, edo, and, osaka, large, scale, rice, markets, developed, there, each, daimyo, also, had, a, capital, city, located, near, the, one, castle, they, were, allowed, to, maintain, daimyos, would, have, agents, in, various, commercial, centers, selling, rice, and, cash, crops, often, exchanged, for, paper, credit, to, be, redeemed, elsewhere, merchants, invented, credit, instruments, to, transfer, money, and, currency, came, into, common, use, in, the, cities, and, towns, guilds, of, merchants, and, artisans, met, the, growing, demand, for, goods, and, services, the, merchants, benefited, enormously, especially, those, with, official, patronage, however, the, neo, confucian, ideology, of, the, shogunate, focused, the, virtues, of, frugality, and, hard, work, it, had, a, rigid, class, system, which, emphasized, agriculture, and, despised, commerce, and, merchants, a, century, after, the, shogunate, s, establishment, problems, began, to, emerge, the, samurai, forbidden, to, engage, in, farming, or, business, but, allowed, to, borrow, money, borrowed, too, much, some, taking, up, side, jobs, as, bodyguards, for, merchants, debt, collectors, or, artisans, the, bakufu, and, daimyos, raised, taxes, on, farmers, but, did, not, tax, business, so, they, too, fell, into, debt, with, some, merchants, specializing, in, loaning, to, daimyos, yet, it, was, inconceivable, to, systematically, tax, commerce, as, it, would, make, money, off, parasitic, activities, raise, the, prestige, of, merchants, and, lower, the, status, of, government, as, they, paid, no, regular, taxes, the, forced, financial, contributions, to, the, daimyos, were, seen, by, some, merchants, as, a, cost, of, doing, business, the, wealth, of, merchants, gave, them, a, degree, of, prestige, and, even, power, over, the, daimyos, by, 1750, rising, taxes, incited, peasant, unrest, and, even, revolt, the, nation, had, to, deal, somehow, with, samurai, impoverishment, and, treasury, deficits, the, financial, troubles, of, the, samurai, undermined, their, loyalties, to, the, system, and, the, empty, treasury, threatened, the, whole, system, of, government, one, solution, was, reactionary, cutting, samurai, salaries, and, prohibiting, spending, for, luxuries, other, solutions, were, modernizing, with, the, goal, of, increasing, agrarian, productivity, the, eighth, tokugawa, shogun, yoshimune, in, office, 1716, 1745, had, considerable, success, though, much, of, his, work, had, to, be, done, again, between, 1787, and, 1793, by, the, shogun, s, chief, councilor, matsudaira, sadanobu, 1759, 1829, other, shoguns, debased, the, coinage, to, pay, debts, which, caused, inflation, overall, while, commerce, domestic, and, international, was, vibrant, and, sophisticated, financial, services, had, developed, in, the, edo, period, the, shogunate, remained, ideologically, focused, on, honest, agricultural, work, as, the, basis, of, society, and, never, sought, to, develop, a, mercantile, or, capitalistic, country, by, 1800, the, commercialization, of, the, economy, grew, rapidly, bringing, more, and, more, remote, villages, into, the, national, economy, rich, farmers, appeared, who, switched, from, rice, to, high, profit, commercial, crops, and, engaged, in, local, money, lending, trade, and, small, scale, manufacturing, wealthy, merchants, were, often, forced, to, lend, money, to, the, shogunate, or, daimyos, often, never, returned, they, often, had, to, hide, their, wealth, and, some, sought, higher, social, status, by, using, money, to, marry, into, the, samurai, class, there, is, some, evidence, that, as, merchants, gained, greater, political, influence, in, the, late, edo, period, the, rigid, class, division, between, samurai, and, merchants, began, to, break, down, a, few, domains, notably, ch, sh, and, satsuma, used, innovative, methods, to, restore, their, finances, but, most, sunk, further, into, debt, the, financial, crisis, provoked, a, reactionary, solution, near, the, end, of, the, tempo, era, 1830, 1843, promulgated, by, the, chief, counselor, mizuno, tadakuni, he, raised, taxes, denounced, luxuries, and, tried, to, impede, the, growth, of, business, he, failed, and, it, appeared, to, many, that, the, continued, existence, of, the, entire, tokugawa, system, was, in, jeopardy, rice, was, the, base, of, the, economy, about, 80, of, the, people, were, rice, farmers, rice, production, increased, steadily, but, population, remained, stable, so, prosperity, increased, rice, paddies, grew, from, 1, 6, million, ch, in, 1600, to, 3, million, by, 1720, improved, technology, helped, farmers, control, the, all, important, flow, of, irrigation, to, their, paddies, the, daimyo, operated, several, hundred, castle, towns, which, became, loci, of, domestic, trade, large, scale, rice, markets, developed, centered, on, edo, and, saka, in, the, cities, and, towns, guilds, of, merchants, and, artisans, met, the, growing, demand, for, goods, and, services, the, merchants, while, low, in, status, prospered, especially,

warriors, nature, folklore, and, the, landscapes, of, hokusai, and, hiroshige, the, genre, declined, throughout, the, rest, of, the, century, in, the, face, of, modernization, that, saw, ukiyo, e, as, both, old, fashioned, and, laborious, to, produce, compared, to, western, technologies, ukiyo, e, was, a, primary, part, of, the, wave, of, japonisme, that, swept, western, art, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, edo, period, was, characterized, by, an, unprecedented, series, of, economic, developments, despite, termination, of, contact, with, the, outside, world, and, cultural, maturation, especially, in, terms, of, theater, music, and, other, entertainment, for, example, a, poetic, meter, for, music, called, kinsei, kouta, ch, was, invented, during, this, time, and, is, still, used, today, in, folk, songs, music, and, theater, were, influenced, by, the, social, gap, between, the, noble, and, commoner, classes, and, different, arts, became, more, defined, as, this, gap, widened, several, different, types, of, kabuki, emerged, some, such, as, shibaraku, were, only, available, at, a, certain, time, of, year, while, some, companies, only, performed, for, nobles, fashion, trends,

and, bonsai, using, deep, pots, became, popular, not, only, did, people, buy, plants, and, appreciate, flowers, but, they, were, also, enthusiastic, about, improving, the, varieties, of, flowers, so, specialized, books, were, published, one, after, another, for, example, matsudaira, sadatomo, produced, 300, varieties, of, iris, and, published, a, technical, book, traveling, became, popular, among, people, because, of, the, improvement, of, roads, and, post, towns, the, main, destinations, were, famous, temples, and, shinto, shrines, around, the, country, and, eating, and, drinking, at, the, inns, and, prostitution, were, one, of, the, main, attractions, what, people, admired, most, was, the, visit, to, ise, grand, shrine, and, the, summit, of, mount, fuji, which, are, considered, the, most, sacred, places, in, japan, the, ise, grand, shrine, in, particular, has, been, visited, by, an, enormous, number, of, visitors, historical, documents, record, that, 3, 62, million, people, visited, the, shrine, in, 50, days, in, 1625, 1, 18, million, people, visited, it, in, three, days, in, 1829, when, the, grand, festival, held, every, 20, years, shikinen, sengu, was, held, it, was, a, once, in, a, lifetime, event, for, people, living, in, remote, areas, so, they, set, up, a, joint, fund, for, each, village, saved, their, travel, expenses, and, went, on, a, group, trip, local, residents, of, ise, grand, shrine, and, mount, fuji, used, to, send, specialized, advertising, personnel, to, various, parts, of, japan, to, solicit, trips, to, local, areas, to, make, money, from, tourism, clothing, acquired, a, wide, variety, of, designs, and, decorative, techniques, especially, for, kimono, worn, by, women, the, main, consumers, of, kimono, were, the, samurai, who, used, lavish, clothing, and, other, material, luxuries, to, signal, their, place, at, the, top, of, the, social, order, driven, by, this, demand, the, textile, industry, grew, and, used, increasingly, sophisticated, methods, of, weaving, dyeing, and, embroidery, over, this, period, women, adopted, brighter, colours, and, bolder, designs, whereas, women, s, and, men, s, kimono, had, been, very, similar, the, rise, of, a, merchant, class, fuelled, more, demand, for, elaborate, costumes, while, ordinary, kimono, would, usually, be, created, by, women, at, home, luxurious, silk, kimono, were, designed, and, created, by, specialist, artists, who, were, usually, men, a, kind, of, kimono, specific, to, the, military, elite, is, the, goshodoki, or, palace, court, style, which, would, be, worn, in, the, residence, of, a, military, leader, a, sh, gun, or, daimyo, these, would, have, landscape, scenes, among, which, there, are, other, motifs, usually, referencing, classic, literature, samurai, men, would, dress, with, a, more, understated, design, with, geometrical, designs, concentrated, around, the, waist, the, yogi, or, sleeping, kimono, is, a, thickly, wadded, form, of, wearable, bedding, usually, with, simple, designs, a, style, called, tsuma, moy, had, rich, decoration, from, the, waist, down, only, and, family, emblems, on, the, neck, and, shoulders, these, would, be, worn, by, women, of, the, merchant, class, the, kimono, of, merchant, class, women, were, more, subdued, than, those, of, the, samurai, but, still, with, bold, colours, and, designs, representing, nature, red, was, a, popular, colour, for, wealthy, women, partly, because, of, its, cultural, association, with, youth, and, passion, and, partly, because, the, dye, derived, from, safflower, was, very, expensive, so, a, bright, red, garment, was, an, ostentatious, display, of, wealth, indian, fabrics, brought, to, japan, by, dutch, importers, were, received, with, enthusiasm, and, found, many, uses, japanese, designers, started, printing, designs, that, were, influenced, by, the, indian, patterns, some, garments, used, fabric, imported, from, britain, or, france, ownership, of, these, exotic, textiles, signified, wealth, and, taste, but, they, were, worn, as, undergarments, where, the, designs, would, not, be, seen, inro, and, netsuke, became, popular, as, accessories, among, men, originally, inro, was, a, portable, case, to, put, a, seal, or, medicine, and, netsuke, was, a, fastener, attached, to, the, case, and, both, were, practical, tools, however, from, the, middle, of, the, edo, period, products, with, high, artistic, value, appeared, and, became, popular, as, male, accessories, especially, samurai, and, wealthy, merchants, competed, to, buy, inro, of, high, artistic, value, at, the, end, of, the, edo, period, the, artistic, value, of, inro, further, increased, and, it, came, to, be, regarded, as, an, art, collection, the, end, of, this, period, is, specifically, called, the, late, tokugawa, shogunate, the, cause, for, the, end, of, this, period, is, controversial, but, is, often, recounted, as, resulting, from, the, forced, opening, of, japan, to, the, world, by, commodore, matthew, perry, of, the, us, navy, whose, armada, known, by, the, japanese, as, the, black, ships, fired, weapons, from, edo, bay, several, artificial, land, masses, were, created, to, block, the, range, of, the, armada, and, this, land, remains, in, what, is, presently, called, the, odaiba, district, the, tokugawa, did, not, eventually, collapse, simply, because, of, intrinsic, failures, foreign, intrusions, helped, to, precipitate, a, complex, political, struggle, between, the, bakufu, and, a, coalition, of, its, critics, the, continuity, of, the, anti, bakufu, movement, in, the, mid, 19th, century, would, finally, bring, down, the, tokugawa, historians, consider, that, a, major, contributing, factor, to, the, decline, of, the, tokugawa, was, poor, management, of, the, central, government, by, the, sh, gun, which, caused, the, social, classes, in, japan, to, fall, apart, from, the, outset, the, tokugawa, attempted, to, restrict, families, accumulation, of, wealth, and, fostered, a, back, to, the, soil, policy, in, which, the, farmer, the, ultimate, producer, was, the, ideal, person, in, society, the, standard, of, living, for, urban, and, rural, dwellers, alike, grew, significantly, during, the, tokugawa, period, better, means, of, crop, production, transport, housing, food, and, entertainment, were, all, available, as, was, more, leisure, time, at, least, for, urban, dwellers, the, literacy, rate, was, high, for, a, preindustrial, society, by, some, estimates, the, literacy, rate, in, the, city, of, edo, was, 80, percent, and, cultural, values, were, redefined, and, widely, imparted, throughout, the, samurai, and, ch, nin, classes, despite, the, reappearance, of, guilds, economic, activities, went, well, beyond, the, restrictive, nature, of, the, guilds, and, commerce, spread, and, a, money, economy, developed, although, government, heavily, restricted, the, merchants, and, viewed, them, as, unproductive, and, usurious, members, of, society, the, samurai, who, gradually, became, separated, from, their, rural, ties, depended, greatly, on, the, merchants, and, artisans, for, consumer, goods, artistic, interests, and, loans, in, this, way, a, subtle, subversion, of, the, warrior, class, by, the, ch, nin, took, place, a, struggle, arose, in, the, face, of, political, limitations, that, the, sh, gun, imposed, on, the, entrepreneurial, class, the, government, ideal, of, an, agrarian, society, failed, to, square, with, the, reality, of, commercial, distribution, a, huge, government, bureaucracy, had, evolved, which, now, stagnated, because, of, its, discrepancy, with, a, new, and, evolving, social, order, compounding, the, situation, the, population, increased, significantly, during, the, first, half, of, the, tokugawa, period, although, the, magnitude, and, growth, rates, are, uncertain, there, were, at, least, 26, million, commoners, and, about, four, million, members, of, samurai, families, and, their, attendants, when, the, first, nationwide, census, was, taken, in, 1721, drought, followed, by, crop, shortages, and, starvation, resulted, in, twenty, great, famines, between, 1675, and, 1837, during, the, tokugawa, period, there, were, 154, famines, of, which, 21, were, widespread, and, serious, the, great, tenmei, famine, 1782, until, 1788, was, the, worst, famine, in, the, edo, period, many, crops, were, damaged, due, to, bad, weather, serious, cold, and, the, 1783, eruption, of, mount, asama, a, worsening, factor, of, the, great, tenmei, famine, was, a, drop, in, global, temperatures, due, to, the, eruption, of, the, icelandic, volcano, laki, in, 1783, the, spread, of, the, famine, was, largely, due, to, mismanagement, of, the, shogunate, and, the, clan, peasant, unrest, grew, and, by, the, late, 18th, century, mass, protests, over, taxes, and, food, shortages, had, become, commonplace, newly, landless, families, became, tenant, farmers, while, the, displaced, rural, poor, moved, into, the, cities, as, the, fortunes, of, previously, well, to, do, families, declined, others, moved, in, to, accumulate, land, and, a, new, wealthy, farming, class, emerged, those, people, who, benefited, were, able, to, diversify, production, and, to, hire, laborers, while, others, were, left, discontented, many, samurai, fell, on, hard, times, and, were, forced, into, handicraft, production, and, wage, jobs, for, merchants, although, japan, was, able, to, acquire, and, refine, a, wide, variety, of, scientific, knowledge, the, rapid, industrialization, of, the, west, during, the, 18th, century, created, a, material, gap, in, terms, of, technologies, and, armament, between, japan, and, the, west, forcing, it, to, abandon, its, policy, of, seclusion, which, contributed, to, the, end, of, the, tokugawa, regime, western, intrusions, were, on, the, increase, in, the, early, 19th, century, russian, warships, and, traders, encroached, on, karafuto, called, sakhalin, under, russian, and, soviet, control, and, on, the, kuril, islands, the, southernmost, of, which, are, considered, by, the, japanese, as, the, northern, islands, of, hokkaid, a,
