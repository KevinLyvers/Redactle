byzantine, empire, sassanid, persia, caucasus, other, regions, the, early, muslim, conquests, or, early, islamic, conquests, arabic, romanized, al, fut, t, al, isl, miyya, also, known, as, the, arab, conquests, were, initiated, in, the, 7th, century, by, muhammad, the, founder, of, islam, he, established, a, new, unified, polity, in, arabia, based, in, medina, that, expanded, rapidly, under, the, rashidun, caliphate, and, the, umayyad, caliphate, culminating, in, muslim, rule, being, established, on, three, continents, asia, africa, and, europe, over, the, next, century, according, to, scottish, historian, james, buchan, in, speed, and, extent, the, first, arab, conquests, were, matched, only, by, those, of, alexander, the, great, and, they, were, more, lasting, at, their, height, the, territory, that, was, conquered, by, the, arab, muslims, stretched, from, iberia, at, the, pyrenees, in, the, west, to, india, at, sind, in, the, east, muslim, control, spanned, sicily, most, of, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, and, the, caucasus, and, central, asia, among, other, drastic, changes, the, early, muslim, conquests, brought, about, the, collapse, of, the, sasanian, empire, and, great, territorial, losses, for, the, byzantine, empire, reasons, that, would, provide, an, explanation, for, the, muslim, victories, have, been, difficult, to, reconstruct, in, hindsight, primarily, because, only, fragmentary, sources, have, survived, from, the, period, american, scholar, fred, mcgraw, donner, suggests, that, muhammad, s, establishment, of, an, islamic, polity, in, arabia, coupled, with, ideological, i, e, religious, coherence, and, mobilization, constituted, the, main, factor, that, propelled, the, early, muslim, armies, to, successfully, establish, in, the, timespan, of, roughly, a, century, one, of, the, largest, empires, in, history, estimates, of, the, total, area, of, the, combined, territory, held, by, the, early, muslim, polities, at, the, conquests, peak, have, been, as, high, as, 13, 000, 000, square, kilometres, 5, 000, 000, sq, mi, most, historians, also, agree, that, as, another, primary, factor, determining, the, early, muslim, conquests, success, the, sasanians, and, the, byzantines, were, militarily, and, economically, exhausted, from, decades, of, warfare, against, each, other, it, has, been, suggested, that, jews, and, some, christians, in, sasanian, and, byzantine, territory, were, dissatisfied, and, welcomed, the, invading, muslim, troops, largely, because, of, religious, conflict, in, both, empires, however, confederations, of, arab, christians, including, the, ghassanids, initially, allied, themselves, with, the, byzantines, there, were, also, instances, of, alliances, between, the, sasanians, and, the, byzantines, such, as, when, they, fought, together, against, the, rashidun, army, during, the, battle, of, firaz, some, of, the, lands, lost, by, the, byzantines, to, the, muslims, namely, egypt, palestine, and, syria, had, been, reclaimed, from, the, sasanians, only, a, few, years, prior, to, the, muslim, conquests, arabia, was, a, region, that, hosted, several, cultures, some, urban, and, others, nomadic, bedouin, arabian, society, was, divided, along, tribal, and, clan, lines, with, the, most, important, divisions, being, between, the, southern, and, northern, tribal, associations, both, the, byzantine, and, sasanian, empires, competed, for, influence, in, arabia, by, sponsoring, clients, and, in, turn, arabian, tribes, sought, the, patronage, of, the, two, rival, empires, to, bolster, their, own, ambitions, the, lakhmid, kingdom, which, covered, parts, of, what, is, now, southern, iraq, and, northern, saudi, arabia, was, a, client, of, persia, and, in, 602, the, persians, deposed, the, lakhmids, to, take, over, the, defense, of, the, southern, frontier, this, left, the, persians, exposed, and, over, extended, helping, to, set, the, stage, for, the, collapse, of, persia, later, that, century, southern, arabia, especially, what, is, now, yemen, had, for, thousands, of, years, been, a, wealthy, region, that, had, been, a, center, of, the, spice, trade, yemen, had, been, at, the, center, of, an, international, trading, network, linking, eurasia, to, africa, and, yemen, had, been, visited, by, merchants, from, east, africa, europe, the, middle, east, india, and, even, from, as, far, away, as, china, in, turn, the, yemeni, were, great, sailors, travelling, up, the, red, sea, to, egypt, and, across, the, indian, ocean, to, india, and, down, the, east, african, coast, inland, the, valleys, of, yemen, had, been, cultivated, by, a, system, of, irrigation, that, had, been, set, back, when, the, marib, dam, was, destroyed, by, an, earthquake, in, about, 450, ad, frankincense, and, myrrh, had, been, greatly, valued, in, the, mediterranean, region, being, used, in, religious, ceremonies, however, the, conversion, of, the, mediterranean, world, to, christianity, had, significantly, reduced, the, demand, for, these, commodities, causing, a, major, economic, slump, in, southern, arabia, which, helped, to, create, the, impression, that, arabia, was, a, backward, region, little, is, known, of, the, pre, islamic, religions, of, arabia, but, it, is, known, that, the, arabs, worshipped, gods, such, as, al, lat, manat, al, uzza, and, hubal, with, the, most, important, being, allah, god, there, were, also, jewish, and, christian, communities, in, arabia, and, aspects, of, arab, religion, reflected, their, influence, pilgrimage, was, a, major, part, of, arabian, paganism, and, one, of, the, most, important, pilgrimage, sites, was, mecca, which, housed, the, kaaba, considered, an, especially, holy, place, to, visit, muhammad, a, merchant, of, mecca, started, to, have, visions, in, which, he, claimed, that, the, archangel, gabriel, had, told, him, that, he, was, the, last, of, the, prophets, continuing, the, work, of, jesus, christ, and, the, prophets, of, tanakh, after, coming, into, conflict, with, the, elite, of, mecca, muhammad, fled, to, the, city, of, yathrib, which, was, renamed, medina, at, yathrib, muhammad, founded, an, islamic, state, and, by, 630, conquered, mecca, the, prolonged, and, escalating, byzantine, sasanian, wars, of, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, and, the, recurring, outbreaks, of, bubonic, plague, plague, of, justinian, left, both, empires, exhausted, and, weakened, in, the, face, of, the, sudden, emergence, and, expansion, of, the, arabs, the, last, of, these, wars, ended, with, victory, for, the, byzantines, emperor, heraclius, regained, all, lost, territories, and, restored, the, true, cross, to, jerusalem, in, 629, the, war, against, zoroastrian, persia, whose, people, worshiped, the, fire, god, ahura, mazda, had, been, portrayed, by, heraclius, as, a, holy, war, in, defense, of, the, christian, faith, and, the, wood, of, the, holy, cross, as, splinters, of, wood, said, to, be, from, the, true, cross, were, known, had, been, used, to, inspire, christian, fighting, zeal, the, idea, of, a, holy, war, against, the, fire, worshipers, as, the, christians, called, the, zoroastrians, had, aroused, much, enthusiasm, leading, to, an, all, out, effort, to, defeat, the, persians, nevertheless, neither, empire, was, given, any, chance, to, recover, as, within, a, few, years, they, were, overrun, by, the, advances, of, the, arabs, newly, united, by, islam, which, according, to, james, howard, johnston, can, only, be, likened, to, a, human, tsunami, according, to, george, liska, the, unnecessarily, prolonged, byzantine, persian, conflict, opened, the, way, for, islam, in, late, 620s, muhammad, had, already, managed, to, conquer, and, unify, much, of, arabia, under, muslim, rule, and, it, was, under, his, leadership, that, the, first, muslim, byzantine, skirmishes, took, place, in, response, to, byzantine, incursions, just, a, few, months, after, heraclius, and, the, persian, general, shahrbaraz, agreed, on, terms, for, the, withdrawal, of, persian, troops, from, occupied, byzantine, eastern, provinces, in, 629, arab, and, byzantine, troops, confronted, each, other, at, the, battle, of, mu, tah, as, a, result, of, byzantine, vassals, murdering, a, muslim, emissary, muhammad, died, in, 632, and, was, succeeded, by, abu, bakr, the, first, caliph, with, undisputed, control, of, the, entire, arab, peninsula, after, the, successful, ridda, wars, which, resulted, in, the, consolidation, of, a, powerful, muslim, state, throughout, the, peninsula, byzantine, sources, such, as, short, history, written, by, nikephoros, claim, that, the, arab, invasion, came, about, as, a, result, of, restrictions, imposed, on, arab, traders, curtailing, their, ability, to, trade, within, byzantine, territory, and, to, send, the, profits, of, their, trade, out, of, byzantine, territory, as, a, result, the, arabs, murdered, a, byzantine, official, named, sergius, whom, they, held, responsible, for, convincing, the, emperor, heraclius, to, impose, the, trade, restrictions, nikephoros, relates, that, the, saracens, having, flayed, a, camel, enclosed, him, in, the, hide, and, sewed, it, up, as, the, skin, hardened, the, man, who, was, left, inside, also, withered, and, so, perished, in, a, painful, manner, the, charge, against, him, was, that, he, had, persuaded, heraclius, not, to, allow, the, saracens, to, trade, from, the, byzantine, country, and, send, out, of, the, byzantine, state, the, thirty, pounds, of, gold, which, they, normally, received, by, way, of, commercial, gain, and, for, this, reason, they, began, to, lay, waste, the, byzantine, land, some, scholars, assert, that, this, is, the, same, sergius, called, the, candidatus, who, was, killed, by, the, saracens, as, related, in, the, 7th, century, doctrina, jacobi, document, in, arabia, swords, from, india, were, greatly, esteemed, as, being, made, of, the, finest, steel, and, were, the, favorite, weapons, of, the, mujahideen, the, arab, sword, known, as, the, sayfy, closely, resembled, the, byzantine, gladius, swords, and, spears, were, the, major, weapons, of, the, muslims, and, armour, was, either, mail, or, leather, in, northern, arabia, byzantine, influence, predominated, in, eastern, arabia, persian, influence, predominated, and, in, yemen, indian, influence, was, felt, as, the, caliphate, spread, the, muslims, were, influenced, by, the, peoples, they, conquered, the, turkic, peoples, in, central, asia, the, persians, and, the, byzantines, in, syria, the, bedouin, tribes, of, arabia, favored, archery, though, contrary, to, popular, belief, bedouin, archers, usually, fought, on, foot, instead, of, horseback, the, arabs, usually, fought, defensive, battles, with, their, archers, placed, on, both, flanks, by, the, umayyad, period, the, caliphate, had, a, standing, army, including, the, elite, ahl, al, sham, people, of, syria, raised, from, the, arabs, who, settled, in, syria, the, caliphate, was, divided, into, jund, or, regional, armies, stationed, in, the, provinces, being, made, of, mostly, arab, tribes, who, were, paid, monthly, by, the, diwan, al, jaysh, war, ministry, the, infantry, of, the, byzantine, army, continued, to, be, recruited, from, within, the, byzantine, empire, but, much, of, the, cavalry, were, either, recruited, from, martial, peoples, in, the, balkans, or, in, asia, minor, or, alternatively, were, germanic, mercenaries, most, of, the, byzantine, troops, in, syria, were, indigenae, local, and, it, seems, that, at, the, time, of, the, muslim, conquest, the, byzantine, forces, in, syria, were, arabs, in, response, to, the, loss, of, syria, the, byzantines, developed, the, phylarch, system, of, using, armenian, and, arab, christian, auxiliaries, living, on, the, frontier, to, provide, a, shield, to, counter, raiding, by, the, muslims, into, the, empire, overall, the, byzantine, army, remained, a, small, but, professional, force, of, foederati, unlike, the, foederati, who, were, sent, where, they, were, needed, the, stradioti, lived, in, the, frontier, provinces, during, the, last, decades, of, the, sasanian, empire, the, frequent, use, of, royal, titles, by, persian, governors, in, central, asia, especially, in, what, is, now, afghanistan, indicates, a, weakening, of, the, power, of, the, shahinshah, king, of, kings, suggesting, the, empire, was, already, breaking, down, at, the, time, of, the, muslim, conquest, persian, society, was, rigidly, divided, into, castes, with, the, nobility, being, of, supposed, aryan, descent, and, this, division, of, persian, society, along, caste, lines, was, reflected, in, the, military, the, azatan, aristocracy, provided, the, cavalry, the, paighan, infantry, came, from, the, peasantry, and, most, of, the, greater, persian, nobility, had, slave, soldiers, this, last, being, based, on, the, persian, example, much, of, the, persian, army, consisted, of, tribal, mercenaries, recruited, from, the, plains, south, of, the, caspian, sea, and, from, what, is, now, afghanistan, the, persian, tactics, were, cavalry, based, with, the, persian, forces, usually, divided, into, a, center, based, upon, a, hill, and, two, wings, of, cavalry, on, either, side, little, is, known, about, the, military, forces, of, the, christian, state, of, ethiopia, other, than, that, they, were, divided, into, sarawit, professional, troops, and, the, ehzab, auxiliaries, the, ethiopians, made, much, use, of, camels, and, elephants, the, berber, peoples, of, north, africa, had, often, served, as, a, federates, auxiliaries, to, the, byzantine, army, the, berber, forces, were, based, around, the, horse, and, camel, but, seemed, to, have, been, hampered, by, a, lack, of, weapons, or, protection, with, both, byzantine, and, arab, sources, mentioning, the, berbers, lacked, armour, and, helmets, the, berbers, went, to, war, with, their, entire, communities, and, the, presence, of, women, and, children, both, slowed, down, the, berber, armies, and, tied, down, berber, tribesmen, who, tried, to, protect, their, families, the, british, historian, david, nicolle, called, the, turkic, peoples, of, central, asia, the, most, formidable, foes, faced, by, the, muslims, the, jewish, turkic, khazar, khanate, based, in, what, is, now, southern, russia, and, ukraine, had, a, powerful, heavy, cavalry, the, turkic, heartland, of, central, asia, was, divided, into, five, khanates, whose, khans, variously, recognized, the, shahs, of, iran, or, the, emperors, of, china, as, their, overlords, turkic, society, was, feudal, with, the, khans, only, being, pater, primus, among, the, aristocracy, of, dihquans, who, lived, in, castles, in, the, countryside, with, the, rest, of, turkic, forces, being, divided, into, kadivar, farmers, khidmatgar, servants, and, atbai, clients, the, heavily, armored, turkic, cavalry, played, a, significant, role, in, influencing, subsequent, muslim, tactics, and, weapons, the, turkic, peoples, who, were, mostly, buddhists, at, the, time, of, the, islamic, conquest, later, converted, to, islam, and, came, to, be, regarded, as, the, foremost, muslim, warriors, to, the, extent, of, replacing, the, arabs, as, the, dominant, peoples, in, the, dar, al, islam, house, of, islam, during, the, migration, period, the, germanic, visigoths, had, traveled, from, their, homeland, north, of, the, danube, to, settle, in, the, roman, province, of, hispania, creating, a, kingdom, upon, the, wreckage, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, visigothic, state, in, iberia, was, based, around, forces, raised, by, the, nobility, whom, the, king, could, call, out, in, the, event, of, war, the, king, had, his, gardingi, and, fideles, loyal, to, himself, while, the, nobility, had, their, bucellarii, the, visigoths, favored, cavalry, with, their, favorite, tactics, being, to, repeatedly, charge, a, foe, combined, with, feigned, retreats, the, muslim, conquest, of, most, of, iberia, in, less, than, a, decade, does, suggest, serious, deficiencies, with, the, visigothic, kingdom, though, the, limited, sources, make, it, difficult, to, discern, the, precise, reasons, for, the, collapse, of, the, visigoths, another, germanic, people, who, founded, a, state, upon, the, ruins, of, the, western, roman, empire, were, the, franks, who, settled, in, gaul, like, the, visigoths, the, frankish, cavalry, played, a, significant, part, in, their, wars, the, frankish, kings, expected, all, of, their, male, subjects, to, perform, three, months, of, military, service, every, year, and, all, serving, under, the, king, s, banner, were, paid, a, regular, salary, those, called, up, for, service, had, to, provide, their, own, weapons, and, horses, which, contributed, to, the, militarisation, of, frankish, society, at, least, part, of, the, reason, for, the, victories, of, charles, martel, was, he, could, call, up, a, force, of, experienced, warriors, when, faced, with, muslim, raids, the, province, of, syria, was, the, first, to, be, wrested, from, byzantine, control, arab, muslim, raids, that, followed, the, ridda, wars, prompted, the, byzantines, to, send, a, major, expedition, into, southern, palestine, which, was, defeated, by, the, arab, forces, under, command, of, khalid, ibn, al, walid, at, the, battle, of, ajnadayn, in, 634, ibn, al, walid, had, converted, to, islam, around, 627, becoming, one, of, muhammad, s, most, successful, generals, ibn, al, walid, had, been, fighting, in, iraq, against, the, sasanians, when, he, led, his, force, on, a, trek, across, the, deserts, to, syria, to, attack, the, byzantines, from, the, rear, in, the, battle, of, the, mud, fought, at, or, near, pella, fahl, and, nearby, scythopolis, beisan, both, in, the, jordan, valley, in, december, 634, or, january, 635, the, arabs, scored, another, victory, after, a, siege, of, six, months, the, arabs, took, damascus, but, emperor, heraclius, later, retook, it, at, the, battle, of, yarmuk, 636, the, arabs, were, victorious, defeating, heraclius, ibn, al, walid, appears, to, have, been, the, real, military, leader, at, yarmuk, under, the, nominal, command, of, others, syria, was, ordered, to, be, abandoned, to, the, muslims, with, heraclius, reportedly, saying, peace, be, with, you, syria, what, a, beautiful, land, you, will, be, for, your, enemy, on, the, heels, of, their, victory, the, arab, armies, took, damascus, again, in, 636, with, baalbek, homs, and, hama, to, follow, soon, afterwards, however, other, fortified, towns, continued, to, resist, despite, the, rout, of, the, imperial, army, and, had, to, be, conquered, individually, jerusalem, fell, in, 638, caesarea, in, 640, while, others, held, out, until, 641, after, a, two, year, siege, the, garrison, of, jerusalem, surrendered, rather, than, starve, to, death, under, the, terms, of, the, surrender, caliph, umar, promised, to, tolerate, the, christians, of, jerusalem, and, not, to, turn, churches, into, mosques, true, to, his, word, umar, allowed, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, to, remain, with, the, caliph, praying, on, a, prayer, rug, outside, of, the, church, the, loss, to, the, muslims, of, jerusalem, the, holiest, city, to, christians, proved, to, be, the, source, of, much, resentment, in, christendom, the, city, of, caesarea, maritima, continued, to, withstand, the, muslim, siege, as, it, could, be, supplied, by, sea, until, it, was, taken, by, assault, in, 640, in, the, mountains, of, asia, minor, the, muslims, enjoyed, less, success, with, the, byzantines, adopting, the, tactic, of, shadowing, warfare, refusing, to, give, battle, to, the, muslims, while, the, people, retreated, into, castles, and, fortified, towns, when, the, muslims, invaded, instead, byzantine, forces, ambushed, muslim, raiders, as, they, returned, to, syria, carrying, plunder, and, people, they, had, enslaved, in, the, frontier, area, where, anatolia, met, syria, the, byzantine, state, evacuated, the, entire, population, and, laid, waste, to, the, countryside, creating, a, no, man, s, land, where, any, invading, army, would, find, no, food, for, decades, afterwards, a, guerrilla, war, was, waged, by, christians, in, the, hilly, countryside, of, north, western, syria, supported, by, the, byzantines, at, the, same, time, the, byzantines, began, a, policy, of, launching, raids, via, sea, on, the, coast, of, the, caliphate, with, the, aim, of, forcing, the, muslims, to, keep, at, least, some, of, their, forces, to, defend, their, coastlines, thus, limiting, the, number, of, troops, available, for, an, invasion, of, anatolia, unlike, syria, with, its, plains, and, deserts, which, favored, the, offensive, the, mountainous, terrain, of, anatolia, favored, the, defensive, and, for, centuries, afterwards, the, line, between, christian, and, muslim, lands, ran, along, the, border, between, anatolia, and, syria, the, byzantine, province, of, egypt, held, strategic, importance, for, its, grain, production, naval, yards, and, as, a, base, for, further, conquests, in, africa, the, muslim, general, amr, ibn, al, as, began, the, conquest, of, the, province, on, his, own, initiative, in, 639, the, majority, of, the, byzantine, forces, in, egypt, were, locally, raised, coptic, forces, intended, to, serve, more, as, a, police, force, since, the, vast, majority, of, egyptians, lived, in, the, nile, river, valley, surrounded, on, both, the, eastern, and, western, sides, by, desert, egypt, was, felt, to, be, a, relatively, secure, province, in, december, 639, amr, entered, the, sinai, with, a, large, force, and, took, pelusium, on, the, edge, of, the, nile, river, valley, and, then, defeated, a, byzantine, counter, attack, at, bibays, contrary, to, expectations, the, arabs, did, not, head, for, alexandria, the, capital, of, egypt, but, instead, for, a, major, fortress, known, as, babylon, located, at, what, is, now, cairo, amr, was, planning, to, divide, the, nile, river, valley, in, two, the, arab, forces, won, a, major, victory, at, the, battle, of, heliopolis, in, 640, but, they, found, it, difficult, to, advance, further, because, major, cities, in, the, nile, delta, were, protected, by, water, and, because, amr, lacked, the, machinery, to, break, down, city, fortifications, the, arabs, laid, siege, to, babylon, and, its, starving, garrison, surrendered, on, 9, april, 641, nevertheless, the, province, was, scarcely, urbanized, and, the, defenders, lost, hope, of, receiving, reinforcements, from, constantinople, when, the, emperor, heraclius, died, in, 641, afterwards, the, arabs, turned, north, into, the, nile, delta, and, laid, siege, to, alexandria, the, last, major, center, to, fall, into, arab, hands, was, alexandria, which, capitulated, in, september, 642, according, to, hugh, kennedy, of, all, the, early, muslim, conquests, that, of, egypt, was, the, swiftest, and, most, complete, seldom, in, history, can, so, massive, a, political, change, have, happened, so, swiftly, and, been, so, long, lasting, in, 644, the, arabs, suffered, a, major, defeat, by, the, caspian, sea, when, an, invading, muslim, army, was, almost, wiped, out, by, the, cavalry, of, the, khazar, khanate, and, seeing, a, chance, to, take, back, egypt, the, byzantines, launched, an, amphibious, attack, which, took, back, alexandria, for, a, short, period, of, time, though, most, of, egypt, is, desert, the, nile, delta, has, some, of, the, most, productive, and, fertile, farmland, in, the, entire, world, which, had, made, egypt, the, granary, of, the, byzantine, empire, control, of, egypt, meant, that, the, caliphate, could, weather, droughts, without, the, fear, of, famine, laying, the, basis, for, the, future, prosperity, of, the, caliphate, the, byzantine, empire, had, traditionally, dominated, the, mediterranean, and, the, black, sea, with, major, naval, bases, at, constantinople, acre, alexandria, and, carthage, in, 652, the, arabs, won, their, first, victory, at, sea, off, alexandria, which, was, followed, by, the, temporary, muslim, conquest, of, cyprus, as, yemen, had, been, a, center, of, maritime, trade, yemeni, sailors, were, brought, to, alexandria, to, start, building, an, islamic, fleet, for, the, mediterranean, the, muslim, fleet, was, based, in, alexandria, and, used, acre, tyre, and, beirut, as, its, forward, bases, the, core, of, the, fleet, s, sailors, were, yemeni, but, the, shipwrights, who, built, the, ships, were, iranian, and, iraqi, in, the, battle, of, the, masts, off, cape, chelidonia, in, anatolia, in, 655, the, muslims, defeated, the, byzantine, fleet, in, a, series, of, boarding, actions, as, a, result, the, byzantines, began, a, major, expansion, of, their, navy, which, was, matched, by, the, arabs, leading, to, a, naval, arms, race, from, the, early, 8th, century, onward, the, muslim, fleet, would, launch, annual, raids, on, the, coastline, on, the, byzantine, empire, in, anatolia, and, greece, as, part, of, the, arms, race, both, sides, sought, new, technology, to, improve, their, warships, the, muslim, warships, had, a, larger, forecastle, which, was, used, to, mount, a, stone, throwing, engine, the, byzantines, invented, greek, fire, an, incendiary, weapon, that, led, the, muslims, to, cover, their, ships, with, water, soaked, cotton, a, major, problem, for, the, muslim, fleet, was, the, shortage, of, timber, which, led, the, muslims, to, seek, qualitative, instead, of, quantitative, superiority, by, building, bigger, warships, to, save, money, the, muslim, shipwrights, switched, from, the, hull, first, method, of, building, ships, to, the, frame, first, method, after, an, arab, incursion, into, sasanian, territories, the, shah, yazdgerd, iii, who, had, just, ascended, the, persian, throne, raised, an, army, to, resist, the, conquerors, although, many, marzbans, refused, to, help, the, persians, suffered, a, devastating, defeat, at, the, battle, of, al, qadisiyyah, in, 636, little, is, known, about, the, battle, of, al, qadisiyyah, other, than, it, lasted, for, several, days, by, the, banks, of, the, river, euphrates, in, what, is, now, iraq, and, ended, with, the, persian, force, being, annihilated, abolishing, the, lakhmid, arab, buffer, state, had, forced, the, persians, to, take, over, the, desert, defense, themselves, leaving, them, overextended, as, a, result, of, al, qadisiyyah, the, arab, muslims, gained, control, over, the, whole, of, iraq, including, ctesiphon, the, capital, city, of, the, sassanids, the, persians, lacked, sufficient, forces, to, make, use, of, the, zagros, mountains, to, stop, the, arabs, having, lost, the, prime, of, their, army, at, al, qadisiyyah, the, persian, forces, withdrew, over, the, zagros, and, the, arab, army, pursued, them, across, the, iranian, plateau, where, the, fate, of, the, sasanian, empire, was, sealed, at, the, battle, of, nahavand, in, 642, the, crushing, muslim, victory, at, nahavand, is, known, in, the, muslim, world, as, the, victory, of, victories, after, nahavand, the, persian, state, collapsed, with, yezdegird, iii, fleeing, further, east, and, various, marzbans, surrendering, to, the, arabs, as, the, conquerors, slowly, covered, the, vast, distances, of, iran, punctuated, by, hostile, towns, and, fortresses, yazdgerd, iii, retreated, finally, taking, refuge, in, khorasan, where, he, was, assassinated, by, a, local, satrap, in, 651, in, the, aftermath, of, their, victory, over, the, imperial, army, the, muslims, still, had, to, contend, with, a, collection, of, militarily, weak, but, geographically, inaccessible, principalities, of, persia, it, took, decades, to, bring, them, all, under, control, of, the, caliphate, in, what, is, now, afghanistan, a, region, where, the, authority, of, the, shah, was, always, disputed, the, muslims, met, fierce, guerrilla, resistance, from, the, militant, buddhist, tribes, of, the, region, despite, the, complete, muslim, triumph, over, sasanid, iran, as, compared, to, the, only, partial, defeat, of, the, byzantine, empire, the, muslims, borrowed, far, more, from, the, vanished, sassanian, state, than, they, ever, did, from, the, byzantines, however, for, the, persians, the, defeat, remained, bitter, some, 400, years, later, the, persian, poet, ferdowsi, wrote, in, his, popular, poem, shahnameh, book, of, kings, damn, this, world, damn, this, time, damn, this, fate, that, uncivilized, arabs, have, come, to, make, me, a, muslim, where, are, your, valiant, warriors, and, priests, where, are, your, hunting, parties, and, your, feats, where, is, that, warlike, mien, and, where, are, those, great, armies, that, destroyed, our, county, s, foes, count, iran, as, a, ruin, as, the, lair, of, lions, and, leopards, look, now, and, despair, right, from, the, start, of, the, caliphate, it, was, realized, that, there, was, a, need, to, write, down, the, sayings, and, story, of, muhammad, which, had, been, memorized, by, his, followers, before, they, all, died, most, people, in, arabia, were, illiterate, and, the, arabs, had, a, strong, culture, of, remembering, history, orally, to, preserve, the, story, of, muhammad, and, to, prevent, any, corruptions, from, entering, the, oral, history, abu, bakr, had, ordered, scribes, to, write, down, the, story, of, muhammad, as, told, to, them, by, his, followers, which, was, the, origin, of, the, quran, disputes, had, emerged, over, which, version, of, the, quran, was, the, correct, one, and, by, 644, different, versions, of, the, quran, were, accepted, in, damascus, basra, hims, and, kufa, to, settle, the, dispute, the, caliph, uthman, had, proclaimed, the, version, of, the, quran, possessed, by, one, of, muhammad, s, widows, hafsa, to, be, the, definitive, and, correct, version, which, offended, some, muslims, who, held, to, the, rival, versions, this, together, with, the, favoritism, shown, by, uthman, to, his, own, clan, the, banu, umayya, in, government, appointments, led, to, a, mutiny, in, medina, in, 656, and, uthman, s, murder, uthman, s, successor, ali, was, faced, with, a, civil, war, known, to, muslims, as, the, fitna, when, the, governor, of, syria, mu, awiya, ibn, abi, sufyan, revolted, against, him, during, this, time, the, first, period, of, muslim, conquests, stopped, as, the, armies, of, islam, turned, against, one, another, a, group, known, as, the, kharaji, decided, to, end, the, civil, war, by, assassinating, the, leaders, of, both, sides, however, the, fitna, ended, in, january, 661, when, ali, was, killed, by, a, kharaji, assassin, allowing, mu, awiya, to, become, caliph, and, found, the, umayyad, dynasty, the, fitna, also, marked, the, beginning, of, the, split, between, shia, muslims, who, supported, ali, and, sunni, muslims, who, opposed, him, mu, awiya, moved, the, capital, of, the, caliphate, from, medina, to, damascus, which, had, a, major, effect, on, the, politics, and, culture, of, the, caliphate, mu, awiya, followed, the, conquest, of, iran, by, invading, central, asia, and, trying, to, finish, off, the, byzantine, empire, by, taking, constantinople, in, 670, a, muslim, fleet, seized, rhodes, and, then, laid, siege, to, constantinople, nicolle, wrote, the, siege, of, constantinople, from, 670, to, 677, was, more, accurately, a, blockade, rather, than, a, siege, proper, which, ended, in, failure, as, the, mighty, walls, built, by, the, emperor, theodosius, ii, in, the, 5th, century, proved, their, worth, the, majority, of, the, people, in, syria, remained, christian, and, a, substantial, jewish, minority, remained, as, well, both, communities, were, to, teach, the, arabs, much, about, science, trade, and, the, arts, the, umayyad, caliphs, are, well, remembered, for, sponsoring, a, cultural, golden, age, in, islamic, history, for, example, by, building, the, dome, of, the, rock, in, jerusalem, and, for, making, damascus, into, the, capital, of, a, superpower, that, stretched, from, portugal, to, central, asia, covering, the, vast, territory, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, borders, of, china, the, rapidity, of, the, early, conquests, has, received, various, explanations, contemporary, christian, writers, conceived, them, as, god, s, punishment, visited, on, their, fellow, christians, for, their, sins, early, muslim, historians, viewed, them, as, a, reflection, of, the, religious, zeal, of, the, conquerors, and, evidence, of, divine, favor, the, theory, that, the, conquests, are, explainable, as, an, arab, migration, triggered, by, economic, pressures, enjoyed, popularity, early, in, the, 20th, century, but, has, largely, fallen, out, of, favor, among, historians, especially, those, who, distinguish, the, migration, from, the, conquests, that, preceded, and, enabled, it, there, are, indications, that, the, conquests, started, as, initially, disorganized, pillaging, raids, launched, partly, by, non, muslim, arab, tribes, in, the, aftermath, of, the, ridda, wars, and, were, soon, extended, into, a, war, of, conquest, by, the, rashidun, caliphs, although, other, scholars, argue, that, the, conquests, were, a, planned, military, venture, already, underway, during, muhammad, s, lifetime, fred, donner, writes, that, the, advent, of, islam, revolutionized, both, the, ideological, bases, and, the, political, structures, of, the, arabian, society, giving, rise, for, the, first, time, to, a, state, capable, of, an, expansionist, movement, according, to, chase, f, robinson, it, is, likely, that, muslim, forces, were, often, outnumbered, but, unlike, their, opponents, they, were, fast, well, coordinated, and, highly, motivated, another, key, reason, was, the, weakness, of, the, byzantine, and, sasanian, empires, caused, by, the, wars, they, had, waged, against, each, other, in, the, preceding, decades, with, alternating, success, it, was, aggravated, by, a, plague, that, had, struck, densely, populated, areas, and, impeded, conscription, of, new, imperial, troops, while, the, arab, armies, could, draw, recruits, from, nomadic, populations, the, sasanian, empire, which, had, lost, the, latest, round, of, hostilities, with, the, byzantines, was, also, affected, by, a, crisis, of, confidence, and, its, elites, suspected, that, the, ruling, dynasty, had, forfeited, the, favor, of, the, gods, the, arab, military, advantage, was, increased, when, christianized, arab, tribes, who, had, served, imperial, armies, as, regular, or, auxiliary, troops, switched, sides, and, joined, the, west, arabian, coalition, arab, commanders, also, made, liberal, use, of, agreements, to, spare, lives, and, property, of, inhabitants, in, case, of, surrender, and, extended, exemptions, from, paying, tribute, to, groups, who, provided, military, services, to, the, conquerors, additionally, the, byzantine, persecution, of, christians, opposed, to, the, chalcedonian, creed, in, syria, and, egypt, alienated, elements, of, those, communities, and, made, them, more, open, to, accommodation, with, the, arabs, once, it, became, clear, that, the, latter, would, let, them, practice, their, faith, undisturbed, as, long, as, they, paid, tribute, the, conquests, were, further, secured, by, the, subsequent, large, scale, migration, of, arabian, peoples, into, the, conquered, lands, robert, hoyland, argues, that, the, failure, of, the, sasanian, empire, to, recover, was, due, in, large, part, to, the, geographically, and, politically, disconnected, nature, of, persia, which, made, coordinated, action, difficult, once, the, established, sasanian, rule, collapsed, similarly, the, difficult, terrain, of, anatolia, made, it, difficult, for, the, byzantines, to, mount, a, large, scale, attack, to, recover, the, lost, lands, and, their, offensive, action, was, largely, limited, to, organizing, guerrilla, operations, against, the, arabs, in, the, levant, although, there, were, sporadic, incursions, by, arab, generals, in, the, direction, of, india, in, the, 660s, and, a, small, arab, garrison, was, established, in, the, arid, region, of, makran, in, the, 670s, the, first, large, scale, arab, campaign, in, the, indus, valley, occurred, when, the, general, muhammad, bin, qasim, invaded, sindh, in, 711, after, a, coastal, march, through, makran, three, years, later, the, arabs, controlled, all, of, the, lower, indus, valley, most, of, the, towns, seem, to, have, submitted, to, arab, rule, under, peace, treaties, although, there, was, fierce, resistance, in, other, areas, including, by, the, forces, of, raja, dahir, at, the, capital, city, debal, arab, incursions, southward, from, sindh, were, repulsed, by, the, armies, of, gurjara, and, chalukya, kingdoms, and, further, islamic, expansion, was, checked, by, the, rashtrakuta, dynasty, which, gained, control, of, the, region, shortly, after, arab, forces, began, launching, sporadic, raiding, expeditions, into, cyrenaica, modern, northeast, libya, and, beyond, soon, after, their, conquest, of, egypt, byzantine, rule, in, northwest, africa, at, the, time, was, largely, confined, to, the, coastal, plains, while, autonomous, berber, polities, controlled, the, rest, in, 670, arabs, founded, the, settlement, of, qayrawan, which, gave, them, a, forward, base, for, further, expansion, muslim, historians, credit, the, general, uqba, ibn, nafi, with, subsequent, conquest, of, lands, extending, to, the, atlantic, coast, although, it, appears, to, have, been, a, temporary, incursion, the, berber, chief, kusayla, and, an, enigmatic, leader, referred, to, as, kahina, prophetess, or, priestess, seem, to, have, mounted, effective, if, short, lived, resistance, to, muslim, rule, at, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, but, the, sources, do, not, give, a, clear, picture, of, these, events, arab, forces, were, able, to, capture, carthage, in, 698, and, tangiers, by, 708, after, the, fall, of, tangiers, many, berbers, joined, the, muslim, army, in, 740, umayyad, rule, in, the, region, was, shaken, by, a, major, berber, revolt, which, also, involved, berber, kharijite, muslims, after, a, series, of, defeats, the, caliphate, was, finally, able, to, crush, the, rebellion, in, 742, although, local, berber, dynasties, continued, to, drift, away, from, imperial, control, from, that, time, on, the, muslim, conquest, of, iberia, is, notable, for, the, brevity, and, unreliability, of, the, available, sources, after, the, visigothic, king, of, spain, wittiza, died, in, 710, the, kingdom, experienced, a, period, of, political, division, the, visigothic, nobility, was, divided, between, the, followers, of, wittiza, and, his, successor, roderic, akhila, wittiza, s, son, had, fled, to, morocco, after, losing, the, succession, struggle, and, muslim, tradition, states, that, he, asked, the, muslims, to, invade, spain, starting, in, the, summer, of, 710, the, muslim, forces, in, morocco, had, launched, several, successful, raids, into, spain, which, demonstrated, the, weakness, of, the, visigothic, state, taking, advantage, of, the, situation, the, muslim, berber, commander, tariq, ibn, ziyad, who, was, stationed, in, tangiers, at, the, time, crossed, the, strait, of, gibraltar, with, an, army, of, arabs, and, berbers, in, 711, most, of, the, invasion, force, of, 15, 000, were, berbers, with, the, arabs, serving, as, an, elite, force, ziyad, landed, on, the, rock, of, gibraltar, on, 29, april, 711, after, defeating, roderic, at, the, river, guadalete, on, 19, july, 711, muslim, forces, advanced, capturing, cities, one, after, another, the, capital, of, toledo, surrendered, peacefully, some, of, the, cities, surrendered, with, agreements, to, pay, tribute, and, local, aristocracy, retained, a, measure, of, former, influence, the, spanish, jewish, community, welcomed, the, muslims, as, liberators, from, the, oppression, of, the, catholic, visigothic, kings, in, 712, another, larger, force, of, 18, 000, from, morocco, led, by, musa, ibn, nusayr, crossed, the, strait, of, gibraltar, to, link, up, with, ziyad, s, force, at, talavera, the, invasion, seemed, to, have, been, on, the, initiative, of, ziyad, the, caliph, al, walid, in, damascus, reacted, as, if, he, was, surprised, to, see, him, by, 713, iberia, was, almost, entirely, under, muslim, control, in, 714, al, walid, summoned, ziyad, to, damascus, to, explain, his, campaign, in, spain, but, ziyad, took, his, time, travelling, through, north, africa, and, palestine, and, was, finally, imprisoned, when, he, arrived, in, damascus, the, events, of, the, subsequent, ten, years, the, details, of, which, are, obscure, included, the, capture, of, barcelona, and, narbonne, and, a, raid, against, toulouse, followed, by, an, expedition, into, burgundy, in, 725, the, last, large, scale, raid, to, the, north, ended, with, a, muslim, defeat, at, the, battle, of, tours, at, the, hands, of, the, franks, in, 732, the, victory, of, the, franks, led, by, charles, martel, over, abd, al, rahman, ibn, abd, allah, al, ghafiqi, has, often, been, misrepresented, as, the, decisive, battle, that, stopped, the, muslim, conquest, of, france, but, the, umayyad, force, had, been, raiding, aquitaine, with, a, particular, interest, in, sacking, churches, and, monasteries, not, seeking, its, conquest, the, battle, itself, is, a, shadowy, affair, with, the, few, sources, describing, it, in, poetic, terms, that, are, frustrating, for, the, historian, the, battle, occurred, between, 18, and, 25, october, 732, with, the, climax, being, an, attack, on, the, muslim, camp, led, by, martel, that, ended, with, al, ghafiqi, being, killed, and, the, muslims, withdrawing, when, night, fell, martel, s, victory, ended, whatever, plans, there, may, have, been, to, conquer, france, but, a, series, of, berber, revolts, in, north, africa, and, in, spain, against, arab, rule, may, have, played, a, greater, role, in, ruling, out, conquests, north, of, the, pyrenees, transoxiana, is, the, region, northeast, of, iran, beyond, the, amu, darya, or, oxus, river, roughly, corresponding, with, modern, day, uzbekistan, tajikistan, and, parts, of, kazakhstan, initial, incursions, across, the, oxus, river, were, aimed, at, bukhara, 673, and, samarqand, 675, and, the, results, were, limited, to, promises, of, tribute, payments, in, 674, a, muslim, force, led, by, ubaidullah, ibn, zayyad, attacked, bukhara, the, capital, of, sogdia, which, ended, with, the, sogdians, agreeing, to, recognize, the, umayadd, caliph, mu, awiaya, as, their, overlord, and, to, pay, tribute, in, general, the, campaigns, in, central, asia, were, hard, fought, with, the, buddhist, turkic, peoples, fiercely, resisting, efforts, to, incorporate, them, into, the, caliphate, china, which, saw, central, asia, as, its, own, sphere, of, influence, particularly, because, of, the, economic, importance, of, the, silk, road, supported, the, turkic, defenders, further, advances, were, hindered, for, a, quarter, century, by, political, upheavals, within, the, umayyad, caliphate, this, was, followed, by, a, decade, of, rapid, military, progress, under, the, leadership, of, the, new, governor, of, khurasan, qutayba, ibn, muslim, which, included, the, conquest, of, bukhara, and, samarqand, in, 706, 712, the, expansion, lost, its, momentum, when, qutayba, was, killed, during, an, army, mutiny, and, the, arabs, were, placed, on, the, defensive, by, an, alliance, of, sogdian, and, t, rgesh, forces, with, support, from, tang, china, however, reinforcements, from, syria, helped, turn, the, tide, and, most, of, the, lost, lands, were, reconquered, by, 741, muslim, rule, over, transoxania, was, consolidated, in, 751, when, a, chinese, led, army, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, talas, medieveal, islamic, scholars, divided, the, area, of, modern, day, afghanistan, into, two, regions, the, provinces, of, khorasan, and, sistan, khorasan, was, the, eastern, satrapy, of, the, sasanian, empire, containing, balkh, and, herat, sistan, included, ghazna, zarang, bost, qandahar, also, called, al, rukhkhaj, or, zamindawar, kabul, kabulistan, and, zabulistan, before, muslim, rule, the, regions, of, balkh, bactria, or, tokharistan, herat, and, sistan, were, under, sasanian, rule, further, south, in, the, balkh, region, in, bamiyan, indication, of, sasanian, authority, diminishes, with, a, local, dynasty, apparently, ruling, from, late, antiquity, probably, hephthalites, subject, to, the, yabghu, of, the, western, turkic, khaganate, while, herat, was, controlled, by, the, sasanians, its, hinterlands, were, controlled, by, northern, hepthalites, who, continued, to, rule, the, ghurid, mountains, and, river, valleys, well, into, the, islamic, era, sistan, was, under, sasanian, administration, but, qandahar, remained, out, of, arab, hands, kabul, and, zabulistan, housed, indic, religions, with, the, zunbils, and, kabul, shahis, for, the, most, part, offering, stiff, resistance, to, muslim, rule, for, two, centuries, until, the, saffarid, and, ghaznavid, conquests, the, umayyad, caliphate, regularly, claimed, nominal, overlordship, over, the, zunbils, and, kabul, shahis, and, in, 711, qutayba, ibn, muslim, managed, to, force, them, to, pay, tribute, in, 646, a, byzantine, naval, expedition, was, able, to, briefly, recapture, alexandria, the, same, year, mu, awiya, the, governor, of, syria, and, future, founder, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, ordered, construction, of, a, fleet, three, years, later, it, was, put, to, use, in, a, pillaging, raid, of, cyprus, followed, by, a, raid, in, 650, that, concluded, with, a, treaty, under, which, cypriots, surrendered, many, of, their, riches, and, slaves, in, 688, the, island, was, made, into, a, joint, dominion, of, the, caliphate, and, the, byzantine, empire, under, a, pact, which, was, to, last, for, almost, 300, years, in, 639, 640, arab, forces, began, to, make, advances, into, armenia, which, had, been, partitioned, into, a, byzantine, province, and, a, sasanian, province, there, is, considerable, disagreement, among, ancient, and, modern, historians, about, events, of, the, following, years, and, nominal, control, of, the, region, may, have, passed, several, times, between, arabs, and, byzantines, although, muslim, dominion, was, finally, established, by, the, time, the, umayyads, acceded, to, power, in, 661, it, was, not, able, to, implant, itself, solidly, in, the, country, and, armenia, experienced, a, national, and, literary, efflorescence, over, the, next, century, as, with, armenia, arab, advances, into, other, lands, of, the, caucasus, region, including, georgia, had, as, their, end, assurances, of, tribute, payment, and, these, principalities, retained, a, large, degree, of, autonomy, this, period, also, saw, a, series, of, clashes, with, the, khazar, kingdom, whose, center, of, power, was, in, the, lower, volga, steppes, and, which, vied, with, the, caliphate, over, control, of, the, caucasus, other, muslim, military, ventures, were, met, with, outright, failure, despite, a, naval, victory, over, the, byzantines, in, 654, at, the, battle, of, the, masts, the, subsequent, attempt, to, besiege, constantinople, was, frustrated, by, a, storm, which, damaged, the, arab, fleet, later, sieges, of, constantinople, in, 668, 669, 674, 678, according, to, other, estimates, and, 717, 718, were, thwarted, with, the, help, of, the, recently, invented, greek, fire, in, the, east, although, arabs, were, able, to, establish, control, over, most, sasanian, controlled, areas, of, modern, afghanistan, after, the, fall, of, persia, the, kabul, region, resisted, repeated, attempts, at, invasion, and, would, continue, to, do, so, until, it, was, conquered, by, the, saffarids, three, centuries, later, by, the, time, of, the, abbasid, revolution, in, the, middle, of, the, 8th, century, muslim, armies, had, come, against, a, combination, of, natural, barriers, and, powerful, states, that, impeded, any, further, military, progress, the, wars, produced, diminishing, returns, in, personal, gains, and, fighters, increasingly, left, the, army, for, civilian, occupations, the, priorities, of, the, rulers, also, shifted, from, conquest, of, new, lands, to, administration, of, the, acquired, empire, although, the, abbasid, era, witnessed, some, new, territorial, gains, such, as, the, conquests, of, sicily, and, crete, the, period, of, rapid, centralized, expansion, would, now, give, way, to, an, era, when, further, spread, of, islam, would, be, slow, and, accomplished, through, the, efforts, of, local, dynasties, missionaries, and, traders, nicolle, writes, that, the, series, of, islamic, conquests, of, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, was, one, of, the, most, significant, events, in, world, history, leading, to, the, creation, of, a, new, civilisation, the, islamicised, and, arabised, middle, east, islam, which, had, previously, been, confined, to, arabia, became, a, major, world, religion, while, the, synthesis, of, arab, byzantine, and, sasanian, elements, led, to, distinctive, new, styles, of, art, and, architecture, emerging, in, the, middle, east, english, historian, edward, gibbon, writes, in, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, under, the, last, of, the, umayyads, the, arabian, empire, extended, two, hundred, days, journey, from, east, to, west, from, the,

with, equal, devotion, at, samarcand, and, seville, the, moor, and, the, indian, embraced, as, countrymen, and, brothers, in, the, pilgrimage, of, mecca, and, the, arabian, language, was, adopted, as, the, popular, idiom, in, all, the, provinces, to, the, westward, of, the, tigris, the, military, victories, of, armies, from, the, arabian, peninsula, heralded, the, expansion, of, arab, culture, and, religion, the, conquests, were, followed, by, a, large, scale, migration, of, families, and, whole, tribes, from, arabia, into, the, lands, of, the, middle, east, the, conquering, arabs, had, already, possessed, a, complex, and, sophisticated, society, emigrants, from, yemen, brought, with, them, agricultural, urban, and, monarchical, traditions, members, of, the, ghassanid, and, lakhmid, tribal, confederations, had, experience, collaborating, with, the, empires, the, rank, and, file, of, the, armies, was, drawn, from, both, nomadic, and, sedentary, tribes, while, the, leadership, came, mainly, from, the, merchant, class, of, the, hejaz, two, fundamental, policies, were, implemented, during, the, reign, of, the, second, caliph, umar, r, 634, 644, the, bedouins, would, not, be, allowed, to, damage, agricultural, production, of, the, conquered, lands, and, the, leadership, would, cooperate, with, the, local, elites, to, that, end, the, arab, muslim, armies, were, settled, in, segregated, quarters, or, new, garrison, towns, such, as, basra, kufa, and, fustat, the, latter, two, became, the, new, administrative, centers, of, iraq, and, egypt, respectively, soldiers, were, paid, a, stipend, and, prohibited, from, seizing, lands, arab, governors, supervised, collection, and, distribution, of, taxes, but, otherwise, left, the, old, religious, and, social, order, intact, at, first, many, provinces, retained, a, large, degree, of, autonomy, under, the, terms, of, agreements, made, with, arab, commanders, as, the, time, passed, the, conquerors, sought, to, increase, their, control, over, local, affairs, and, make, existing, administrative, machinery, work, for, the, new, regime, this, involved, several, types, of, reorganization, in, the, mediterranean, region, city, states, which, traditionally, governed, themselves, and, their, surrounding, areas, were, replaced, by, a, territorial, bureaucracy, separating, town, and, rural, administration, in, egypt, fiscally, independent, estates, and, municipalities, were, abolished, in, favor, of, a, simplified, administrative, system, in, the, early, 8th, century, syrian, arabs, began, to, replace, coptic, functionaries, and, communal, levies, gave, way, to, individual, taxation, in, iran, the, administrative, reorganization, and, construction, of, protective, walls, prompted, agglomeration, of, quarters, and, villages, into, large, cities, such, as, isfahan, qazvin, and, qum, local, notables, of, iran, who, at, first, had, almost, complete, autonomy, were, incorporated, into, the, central, bureaucracy, by, the, abbasid, period, the, similarity, of, egyptian, and, khurasanian, official, paperwork, at, the, time, of, the, caliph, al, mansur, r, 754, 775, suggests, a, highly, centralized, empire, wide, administration, the, society, of, new, arab, settlements, gradually, became, stratified, into, classes, based, on, wealth, and, power, it, was, also, reorganized, into, new, communal, units, that, preserved, clan, and, tribal, names, but, were, in, fact, only, loosely, based, around, old, kinship, bonds, arab, settlers, turned, to, civilian, occupations, and, in, eastern, regions, established, themselves, as, a, landed, aristocracy, at, the, same, time, distinctions, between, the, conquerors, and, local, populations, began, to, blur, in, iran, the, arabs, largely, assimilated, into, local, culture, adopting, the, persian, language, and, customs, and, marrying, persian, women, in, iraq, non, arab, settlers, flocked, to, garrison, towns, soldiers, and, administrators, of, the, old, regime, came, to, seek, their, fortunes, with, the, new, masters, while, slaves, laborers, and, peasants, fled, there, seeking, to, escape, the, harsh, conditions, of, life, in, the, countryside, non, arab, converts, to, islam, were, absorbed, into, the, arab, muslim, society, through, an, adaptation, of, the, tribal, arabian, institution, of, clientage, in, which, protection, of, the, powerful, was, exchanged, for, loyalty, of, the, subordinates, the, clients, mawali, and, their, heirs, were, regarded, as, virtual, members, of, the, clan, the, clans, became, increasingly, economically, and, socially, stratified, for, example, while, the, noble, clans, of, the, tamim, tribe, acquired, persian, cavalry, units, as, their, mawali, other, clans, of, the, same, tribe, had, slave, laborers, as, theirs, slaves, often, became, mawali, of, their, former, masters, when, they, were, freed, contrary, to, the, belief, of, earlier, historians, there, is, no, evidence, of, mass, conversions, to, islam, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, conquests, the, first, groups, to, convert, were, christian, arab, tribes, although, some, of, them, retained, their, religion, into, the, abbasid, era, even, while, serving, as, troops, of, the, caliphate, they, were, followed, by, former, elites, of, the, sasanian, empire, whose, conversion, ratified, their, old, privileges, with, time, the, weakening, of, non, muslim, elites, facilitated, the, breakdown, of, old, communal, ties, and, reinforced, the, incentives, of, conversion, which, promised, economic, advantages, and, social, mobility, by, the, beginning, of, the, 8th, century, conversions, became, a, policy, issue, for, the, caliphate, they, were, favored, by, religious, activists, and, many, arabs, accepted, the, equality, of, arabs, and, non, arabs, however, conversion, was, associated, with, economic, and, political, advantages, and, muslim, elites, were, reluctant, to, see, their, privileges, diluted, public, policy, towards, converts, varied, depending, on, the, region, and, was, changed, by, successive, umayyad, caliphs, these, circumstances, provoked, opposition, from, non, arab, converts, whose, ranks, included, many, active, soldiers, and, helped, set, the, stage, for, the, civil, war, which, ended, with, the, fall, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, the, arab, muslim, conquests, followed, a, general, pattern, of, nomadic, conquests, of, settled, regions, whereby, the, conquering, peoples, became, the, new, military, elite, and, reached, a, compromise, with, the, old, elites, by, allowing, them, to, retain, local, political, religious, and, financial, authority, peasants, workers, and, merchants, paid, taxes, while, members, of, the, old, and, new, elites, collected, them, payment, of, taxes, which, for, peasants, often, reached, half, of, the, value, of, their, produce, was, an, economic, burden, as, well, as, a, mark, of, social, inferiority, scholars, differ, in, their, assessment, of, relative, tax, burdens, before, and, after, the, conquests, john, esposito, states, that, in, effect, this, meant, lower, taxes, according, to, bernard, lewis, available, evidence, suggests, that, the, change, from, byzantine, to, arab, rule, was, welcomed, by, many, among, the, subject, peoples, who, found, the, new, yoke, far, lighter, than, the, old, both, in, taxation, and, in, other, matters, in, contrast, norman, stillman, writes, that, although, the, tax, burden, of, the, jews, under, early, islamic, rule, was, comparable, to, that, under, previous, rulers, christians, of, the, byzantine, empire, though, not, christians, of, the, persian, empire, whose, status, was, similar, to, that, of, the, jews, and, zoroastrians, of, iran, shouldered, a, considerably, heavier, burden, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, conquests, in, the, wake, of, the, early, conquests, taxes, could, be, levied, on, individuals, on, the, land, or, as, collective, tribute, during, the, first, century, of, islamic, expansion, the, words, jizya, and, kharaj, were, used, in, all, three, senses, with, context, distinguishing, between, individual, and, land, taxes, regional, variations, in, taxation, at, first, reflected, the, diversity, of, previous, systems, the, sasanian, empire, had, a, general, tax, on, land, and, a, poll, tax, having, several, rates, based, on, wealth, with, an, exemption, for, aristocracy, this, poll, tax, was, adapted, by, arab, rulers, so, that, the, aristocracy, exemption, was, assumed, by, the, new, arab, muslim, elite, and, shared, by, local, aristocracy, who, converted, to, islam, the, nature, of, byzantine, taxation, remains, partly, unclear, but, it, appears, to, have, been, levied, as, a, collective, tribute, on, population, centers, and, this, practice, was, generally, followed, under, the, arab, rule, in, former, byzantine, provinces, collection, of, taxes, was, delegated, to, autonomous, local, communities, on, the, condition, that, the, burden, be, divided, among, its, members, in, the, most, equitable, manner, in, most, of, iran, and, central, asia, local, rulers, paid, a, fixed, tribute, and, maintained, their, autonomy, in, tax, collection, difficulties, in, tax, collection, soon, appeared, egyptian, copts, who, had, been, skilled, in, tax, evasion, since, roman, times, were, able, to, avoid, paying, the, taxes, by, entering, monasteries, which, were, initially, exempt, from, taxation, or, simply, by, leaving, the, district, where, they, were, registered, this, prompted, imposition, of, taxes, on, monks, and, introduction, of, movement, controls, in, iraq, many, peasants, who, had, fallen, behind, with, their, tax, payments, converted, to, islam, and, abandoned, their, land, for, arab, garrison, towns, in, hope, of, escaping, taxation, faced, with, a, decline, in, agriculture, and, a, treasury, shortfall, the, governor, of, iraq, al, hajjaj, ibn, yusuf, forced, peasant, converts, to, return, to, their, lands, and, subjected, them, to, the, taxes, again, effectively, forbidding, them, from, converting, to, islam, in, khorasan, a, similar, phenomenon, forced, the, native, aristocracy, to, compensate, for, the, shortfall, in, tax, collection, out, of, their, own, pockets, and, they, responded, by, persecuting, peasant, converts, and, imposing, heavier, taxes, on, poor, muslims, the, situation, where, conversion, to, islam, was, penalized, in, an, islamic, state, could, not, last, and, the, umayyad, caliph, umar, ibn, abd, al, aziz, r, 717, 720, has, been, credited, with, changing, the, taxation, system, modern, historians, doubt, this, account, although, details, of, the, transition, to, the, system, of, taxation, elaborated, by, abbasid, era, jurists, are, unclear, umar, ii, ordered, governors, to, cease, collection, of, taxes, from, muslim, converts, but, his, successors, obstructed, this, policy, and, some, governors, sought, to, stem, the, tide, of, conversions, by, introducing, additional, requirements, such, as, circumcision, and, the, ability, to, recite, passages, from, the, quran, taxation, related, grievances, of, non, arab, muslims, contributed, to, the, opposition, movements, which, resulted, in, the, abbasid, revolution, under, the, new, system, that, was, eventually, established, kharaj, came, to, be, regarded, as, a, tax, levied, on, the, land, regardless, of, the, taxpayer, s, religion, the, poll, tax, was, no, longer, levied, on, muslims, but, the, treasury, did, not, necessarily, suffer, and, converts, did, not, gain, as, a, result, since, they, had, to, pay, zakat, which, was, probably, instituted, as, a, compulsory, tax, on, muslims, around, 730, the, terminology, became, specialized, during, the, abbasid, era, so, that, kharaj, no, longer, meant, anything, more, than, land, tax, while, the, term, jizya, was, restricted, to, the, poll, tax, on, dhimmis, the, influence, of, jizya, on, conversion, has, been, a, subject, of, scholarly, debate, julius, wellhausen, holds, that, the, poll, tax, amounted, to, so, little, that, exemption, from, it, did, not, constitute, sufficient, economic, motive, for, conversion, similarly, thomas, arnold, states, that, jizya, was, too, moderate, to, constitute, a, burden, seeing, that, it, released, them, from, the, compulsory, military, service, that, was, incumbent, on, their, muslim, fellow, subjects, he, further, adds, that, converts, escaping, taxation, would, have, to, pay, the, legal, alms, zakat, that, is, annually, levied, on, most, kinds, of, movable, and, immovable, property, other, early, 20th, century, scholars, suggest, that, non, muslims, converted, to, islam, en, masse, in, order, to, escape, the, poll, tax, but, this, theory, has, been, challenged, by, more, recent, research, daniel, dennett, has, shown, that, other, factors, such, as, desire, to, retain, social, status, had, greater, influence, on, this, choice, in, the, early, islamic, period, the, arab, conquerors, did, not, repeat, the, mistakes, which, had, been, made, by, the, governments, of, the, byzantine, and, sasanian, empires, which, had, tried, and, failed, to, impose, an, official, religion, on, subject, populations, which, had, caused, resentments, that, made, the, muslim, conquests, more, acceptable, to, them, instead, the, rulers, of, the, new, empire, generally, respected, the, traditional, middle, eastern, pattern, of, religious, pluralism, which, was, not, one, of, equality, but, rather, of, dominance, by, one, group, over, the, others, after, the, end, of, military, operations, which, involved, sacking, of, some, monasteries, and, confiscation, of, zoroastrian, fire, temples, in, syria, and, iraq, the, early, caliphate, was, characterized, by, religious, tolerance, and, peoples, of, all, ethnicities, and, religions, blended, in, public, life, before, muslims, were, ready, to, build, mosques, in, syria, they, accepted, christian, churches, as, holy, places, and, shared, them, with, local, christians, in, iraq, and, egypt, muslim, authorities, cooperated, with, christian, religious, leaders, numerous, churches, were, repaired, and, new, ones, built, during, the, umayyad, era, the, first, umayyad, caliph, muawiyah, made, deliberate, efforts, to, convince, those, whom, he, had, conquered, that, he, was, not, opposed, to, their, religion, and, tried, to, enlist, support, from, christian, arab, elites, there, is, no, evidence, for, public, display, of, islam, by, the, state, before, the, reign, of, abd, al, malik, 685, 705, when, quranic, verses, and, references, to, muhammad, suddenly, became, prominent, on, coins, and, official, documents, this, change, was, motivated, by, a, desire, to, unify, the, muslim, community, after, the, second, civil, war, and, rally, them, against, their, chief, common, enemy, the, byzantine, empire, a, further, change, of, policy, occurred, during, the, reign, of, umar, ii, 717, 720, the, disastrous, failure, of, the, siege, of, constantinople, in, 718, which, was, accompanied, by, massive, arab, casualties, led, to, a, spike, of, popular, animosity, among, muslims, toward, byzantium, and, christians, in, general, at, the, same, time, many, arab, soldiers, left, the, army, for, civilian, occupations, and, they, wished, to, emphasize, their, high, social, status, among, the, conquered, peoples, these, events, prompted, introduction, of, restrictions, on, non, muslims, which, according, to, hoyland, were, modeled, both, on, byzantine, curbs, on, jews, starting, with, the, theodosian, code, and, later, codes, which, contained, prohibitions, against, building, new, synagogues, and, giving, testimony, against, christians, and, on, sassanid, regulations, that, prescribed, distinctive, attire, for, different, social, classes, in, the, following, decades, islamic, jurists, elaborated, a, legal, framework, in, which, other, religions, would, have, a, protected, but, subordinate, status, islamic, law, followed, the, byzantine, precedent, of, classifying, subjects, of, the, state, according, to, their, religion, in, contrast, to, the, sasanian, model, which, put, more, weight, on, social, than, on, religious, distinctions, in, theory, like, the, byzantine, empire, the, caliphate, placed, severe, restrictions, on, paganism, but, in, practice, most, non, abrahamic, communities, of, the, former, sasanian, territories, were, classified, as, possessors, of, a, scripture, ahl, al, kitab, and, granted, protected, dhimmi, status, in, islam, christians, and, jews, are, seen, as, peoples, of, the, book, as, the, muslims, accept, both, jesus, christ, and, the, jewish, prophets, as, their, own, prophets, which, accorded, them, a, respect, that, was, not, reserved, to, the, heathen, peoples, of, iran, central, asia, and, india, in, places, like, the, levant, and, egypt, both, christians, and, jews, were, allowed, to, maintain, their, churches, and, synagogues, and, keep, their, own, religious, organizations, in, exchange, for, paying, the, jizya, tax, at, times, the, caliphs, engaged, in, triumphalist, gestures, like, building, the, famous, dome, of, the, rock, mosque, in, jerusalem, from, 690, to, 692, on, the, site, of, the, jewish, second, temple, which, had, been, destroyed, by, the, romans, in, 70, ad, though, the, use, of, roman, and, sassanian, symbols, of, power, in, the, mosque, suggests, its, purpose, was, partly, to, celebrate, the, arab, victories, over, the, two, empires, those, christians, out, of, favor, with, the, prevailing, orthodoxy, in, the, roman, empire, often, preferred, to, live, under, muslim, rule, as, it, meant, the, end, of, persecution, as, both, the, jewish, and, christian, communities, of, the, levant, and, north, africa, were, better, educated, than, their, conquerors, they, were, often, employed, as, civil, servants, in, the, early, years, of, the, caliphate, however, a, reported, saying, of, muhammad, that, two, religions, may, not, dwell, together, in, arabia, led, to, different, policies, being, pursued, in, arabia, with, conversion, to, islam, being, imposed, rather, than, merely, encouraged, with, the, notable, exception, of, yemen, where, a, large, jewish, community, existed, right, up, until, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, all, of, the, christian, and, jewish, communities, in, arabia, completely, disappeared, the, jewish, community, of, yemen, seems, to, have, survived, as, yemen, was, not, regarded, as, part, of, arabia, proper, in, the, same, way, that, the, hejaz, and, the, nejd, were, mark, r, cohen, writes, that, the, jizya, paid, by, jews, under, islamic, rule, provided, a, surer, guarantee, of, protection, from, non, jewish, hostility, than, that, possessed, by, jews, in, the, latin, west, where, jews, paid, numerous, and, often, unreasonably, high, and, arbitrary, taxes, in, return, for, official, protection, and, where, treatment, of, jews, was, governed, by, charters, which, new, rulers, could, alter, at, will, upon, accession, or, refuse, to, renew, altogether, the, pact, of, umar, which, stipulated, that, muslims, must, do, battle, to, guard, the, dhimmis, and, put, no, burden, on, them, greater, than, they, can, bear, was, not, always, upheld, but, it, remained, a, steadfast, cornerstone, of, islamic, policy, into, early, modern, times
