https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War
the, thirty, years, war, from, 1618, to, 1648, was, one, of, the, most, destructive, conflicts, in, european, history, fought, primarily, in, central, europe, an, estimated, 4, 5, to, 8, million, soldiers, and, civilians, died, from, the, effects, of, battle, famine, or, disease, while, parts, of, germany, reported, population, declines, of, over, 50, related, conflicts, include, the, eighty, years, war, the, war, of, the, mantuan, succession, the, franco, spanish, war, the, torstenson, war, the, dutch, portuguese, war, and, the, portuguese, restoration, war, the, war, can, be, seen, as, a, continuation, of, the, religious, conflict, initiated, by, the, 16th, century, reformation, within, the, holy, roman, empire, the, 1555, peace, of, augsburg, attempted, to, resolve, this, by, dividing, the, empire, into, catholic, and, lutheran, states, but, over, the, next, 50, years, the, expansion, of, protestantism, beyond, these, boundaries, destabilised, the, settlement, however, while, differences, over, religion, and, imperial, authority, were, important, factors, in, causing, the, war, some, contemporary, commentators, suggest, its, scope, and, extent, were, driven, by, the, contest, for, european, dominance, between, habsburg, ruled, spain, and, austria, and, the, french, house, of, bourbon, its, outbreak, is, generally, traced, to, 1618, when, emperor, ferdinand, ii, was, deposed, as, king, of, bohemia, and, replaced, by, the, protestant, frederick, v, of, the, palatinate, although, imperial, forces, quickly, suppressed, the, bohemian, revolt, frederick, s, participation, expanded, the, fighting, into, the, palatinate, whose, strategic, importance, drew, in, the, dutch, republic, and, spain, then, engaged, in, the, eighty, years, war, in, addition, the, acquisition, of, territories, within, the, empire, by, rulers, like, christian, iv, of, denmark, and, gustavus, adolphus, of, sweden, gave, them, and, other, foreign, powers, an, ongoing, motive, to, intervene, combined, with, fears, that, the, protestant, religion, in, general, was, threatened, what, started, as, an, internal, dynastic, dispute, became, a, european, conflict, from, 1618, until, 1635, the, conflict, was, primarily, a, civil, war, within, the, holy, roman, empire, with, support, from, external, powers, after, 1635, the, empire, became, one, theatre, in, a, wider, struggle, between, france, chiefly, supported, by, sweden, and, emperor, ferdinand, iii, whose, principal, ally, was, spain, fighting, ended, with, the, 1648, peace, of, westphalia, the, terms, of, which, included, greater, autonomy, within, the, empire, for, states, like, bavaria, and, saxony, as, well, as, acceptance, of, dutch, independence, by, spain, the, conflict, shifted, the, balance, of, power, in, favour, of, france, and, set, the, stage, for, the, expansionist, wars, of, louis, xiv, which, dominated, europe, for, the, next, sixty, years, the, 1552, peace, of, passau, ended, the, schmalkaldic, war, a, religious, conflict, between, protestants, and, catholics, within, the, holy, roman, empire, the, 1555, peace, of, augsburg, tried, to, prevent, their, recurrence, by, fixing, boundaries, between, the, two, faiths, using, the, principle, of, cuius, regio, eius, religio, this, designated, individual, states, as, either, lutheran, then, the, most, usual, form, of, protestantism, or, catholic, based, on, the, religion, of, their, ruler, other, provisions, protected, substantial, religious, minorities, in, cities, like, donauw, rth, and, confirmed, lutheran, ownership, of, property, taken, from, the, catholic, church, since, passau, these, agreements, were, undermined, by, the, post, 1555, expansion, of, protestantism, into, areas, previously, designated, as, catholic, another, factor, was, the, growth, of, protestant, faiths, not, recognised, by, augsburg, especially, calvinism, which, was, viewed, with, hostility, by, both, lutherans, and, catholics, the, peace, of, augsburg, also, gave, individual, rulers, within, the, empire, greater, political, autonomy, and, control, over, the, religion, practised, in, their, domains, while, weakening, central, authority, conflict, over, economic, and, political, objectives, frequently, superseded, religion, with, lutheran, saxony, denmark, norway, and, sweden, competing, with, each, other, and, calvinist, brandenburg, over, the, baltic, trade, managing, these, issues, was, hampered, by, the, fragmented, nature, of, the, empire, its, representative, institutions, included, 300, imperial, estates, distributed, across, germany, the, low, countries, northern, italy, and, present, day, france, these, ranged, in, size, and, importance, from, the, seven, prince, electors, who, voted, for, the, holy, roman, emperor, down, to, prince, bishoprics, and, imperial, cities, like, hamburg, each, also, belonged, to, a, regional, grouping, or, imperial, circle, which, primarily, focused, on, defence, and, operated, as, autonomous, bodies, above, all, of, these, was, the, imperial, diet, which, only, assembled, on, an, irregular, basis, and, then, largely, served, as, a, forum, for, discussion, rather, than, legislation, although, in, theory, emperors, were, elected, the, position, had, been, held, by, the, house, of, habsburg, since, 1440, the, largest, single, landowner, within, the, holy, roman, empire, they, controlled, lands, containing, over, eight, million, subjects, including, austria, bohemia, and, hungary, the, habsburgs, also, ruled, the, spanish, empire, until, 1556, when, charles, v, divided, the, two, empires, between, different, branches, of, the, family, this, bond, was, reinforced, by, frequent, inter, marriage, while, spain, retained, imperial, territories, such, as, the, spanish, netherlands, milan, and, franche, comt, although, these, links, meant, the, austrian, and, spanish, habsburgs, often, worked, together, their, objectives, did, not, always, align, spain, was, a, global, maritime, superpower, whose, possessions, stretched, from, europe, to, the, philippines, and, much, of, the, americas, in, contrast, austria, was, a, land, based, power, focused, on, ensuring, their, pre, eminence, within, germany, and, securing, their, eastern, border, against, the, ottoman, empire, before, augsburg, unity, of, religion, compensated, for, lack, of, strong, central, authority, once, removed, it, presented, opportunities, for, those, who, sought, to, further, weaken, it, these, included, ambitious, imperial, states, like, lutheran, saxony, and, catholic, bavaria, as, well, as, france, confronted, by, habsburg, lands, on, its, borders, to, the, north, south, and, along, the, pyrenees, since, many, foreign, rulers, were, also, imperial, princes, divisions, within, the, empire, drew, in, external, powers, like, christian, iv, of, denmark, who, joined, the, war, in, 1625, as, duke, of, holstein, gottorp, disputes, occasionally, resulted, in, full, scale, conflict, like, the, 1583, to, 1588, cologne, war, caused, when, its, ruler, converted, to, calvinism, more, common, were, events, such, as, the, 1606, battle, of, the, flags, in, donauw, rth, when, riots, broke, out, after, the, lutheran, majority, blocked, a, catholic, religious, procession, emperor, rudolf, approved, intervention, by, the, catholic, maximilian, of, bavaria, in, return, he, was, allowed, to, annex, the, town, and, as, agreed, at, augsburg, the, official, religion, changed, from, lutheran, to, catholic, when, the, imperial, diet, opened, in, february, 1608, both, lutherans, and, calvinists, sought, formal, re, confirmation, of, the, augsburg, settlement, in, return, the, habsburg, heir, archduke, ferdinand, required, the, immediate, restoration, of, all, property, taken, from, the, catholic, church, since, 1555, rather, than, the, previous, practice, whereby, the, court, ruled, case, by, case, this, demand, threatened, all, protestants, paralysed, the, diet, and, removed, the, perception, of, imperial, neutrality, loss, of, faith, in, central, authority, meant, towns, and, rulers, began, strengthening, their, fortifications, and, armies, outside, travellers, often, commented, on, the, growing, militarisation, of, germany, in, this, period, in, 1608, frederick, iv, elector, palatine, formed, the, protestant, union, and, maximilian, responded, by, setting, up, the, catholic, league, in, july, 1609, both, were, created, to, support, the, dynastic, ambitions, of, their, leaders, but, combined, with, the, 1609, to, 1614, war, of, the, j, lich, succession, the, result, was, to, increase, tensions, throughout, the, empire, some, historians, who, see, the, war, as, primarily, a, european, conflict, argue, j, lich, marks, its, beginning, with, spain, and, austria, backing, the, catholic, candidate, france, and, the, dutch, republic, the, protestant, external, powers, became, involved, in, what, was, an, internal, german, dispute, due, to, the, imminent, expiry, of, the, 1609, twelve, years, truce, which, suspended, the, eighty, years, war, between, spain, and, the, dutch, republic, before, restarting, hostilities, ambrosio, spinola, commander, in, the, spanish, netherlands, needed, to, secure, the, spanish, road, an, overland, route, connecting, habsburg, possessions, in, italy, to, flanders, this, allowed, him, to, move, troops, and, supplies, by, road, rather, than, sea, where, the, dutch, navy, was, dominant, by, 1618, the, only, part, not, controlled, by, spain, ran, through, the, electoral, palatinate, since, emperor, matthias, had, no, surviving, children, in, july, 1617, philip, iii, of, spain, agreed, to, support, ferdinand, s, election, as, king, of, bohemia, and, hungary, in, return, ferdinand, made, concessions, to, spain, in, northern, italy, and, alsace, and, agreed, to, support, their, offensive, against, the, dutch, doing, so, required, his, election, as, emperor, which, was, not, guaranteed, maximilian, of, bavaria, who, opposed, the, increase, of, spanish, influence, in, an, area, he, considered, his, own, tried, to, create, a, coalition, with, saxony, and, the, palatinate, to, support, his, candidacy, another, option, was, frederick, v, elector, palatine, a, calvinist, who, succeeded, his, father, in, 1610, and, in, 1613, married, elizabeth, stuart, daughter, of, james, i, of, england, four, of, the, electors, were, catholic, and, three, were, protestant, if, this, balance, changed, it, would, potentially, result, in, the, election, of, a, protestant, emperor, when, ferdinand, became, king, of, bohemia, in, 1617, he, also, gained, control, of, its, electoral, vote, however, his, conservative, catholicism, made, him, unpopular, with, the, predominantly, protestant, nobility, who, were, also, concerned, about, the, erosion, of, their, rights, these, factors, combined, to, bring, about, the, bohemian, revolt, in, may, 1618, ferdinand, once, claimed, he, would, rather, see, his, lands, destroyed, than, tolerate, heresy, within, them, less, than, 18, months, after, taking, control, of, styria, in, 1595, he, had, eliminated, protestantism, in, what, had, been, a, stronghold, of, the, reformation, absorbed, by, their, war, in, the, netherlands, his, spanish, relatives, preferred, to, avoid, antagonising, protestants, elsewhere, they, recognised, the, dangers, associated, with, ferdinand, s, fervent, catholicism, but, supported, his, claim, due, to, the, lack, of, alternatives, on, being, elected, king, of, bohemia, in, may, 1617, ferdinand, reconfirmed, protestant, religious, freedoms, but, his, record, in, styria, led, to, the, suspicion, he, was, only, awaiting, a, chance, to, overturn, them, these, concerns, were, heightened, after, a, series, of, legal, disputes, over, property, were, all, decided, in, favour, of, the, catholic, church, in, may, 1618, protestant, nobles, led, by, count, thurn, met, in, prague, castle, with, ferdinand, s, two, catholic, representatives, vilem, slavata, and, jaroslav, borzita, in, what, became, known, as, the, third, defenestration, of, prague, both, men, were, thrown, out, of, the, castle, windows, along, with, their, secretary, filip, fabricius, although, all, three, survived, thurn, established, a, protestant, dominated, government, in, bohemia, while, unrest, expanded, into, silesia, and, the, habsburg, heartlands, of, lower, and, upper, austria, where, much, of, the, nobility, was, also, protestant, losing, control, of, these, threatened, the, entire, habsburg, state, while, bohemia, was, one, of, the, most, prosperous, areas, of, the, empire, and, its, electoral, vote, crucial, to, ensuring, ferdinand, succeeded, matthias, as, emperor, the, combination, meant, their, recapture, was, vital, for, the, austrian, habsburgs, but, chronic, financial, weakness, left, them, dependent, on, maximilian, and, spain, for, the, resources, needed, to, achieve, this, spanish, involvement, inevitably, drew, in, the, dutch, and, potentially, france, although, the, strongly, catholic, louis, xiii, of, france, faced, his, own, protestant, rebels, at, home, and, refused, to, support, them, elsewhere, the, revolt, also, provided, opportunities, for, external, opponents, of, the, habsburgs, including, the, ottoman, empire, and, savoy, funded, by, frederick, and, charles, emmanuel, i, duke, of, savoy, a, mercenary, army, under, ernst, von, mansfeld, was, sent, to, support, the, bohemian, rebels, attempts, by, maximilian, and, john, george, of, saxony, to, broker, a, negotiated, solution, ended, when, matthias, died, in, march, 1619, since, many, believed, the, loss, of, his, authority, and, influence, had, fatally, damaged, the, habsburgs, by, mid, june, 1619, the, bohemian, army, under, thurn, was, outside, vienna, and, although, mansfeld, s, defeat, by, imperial, forces, at, sablat, forced, him, to, return, to, prague, ferdinand, s, position, continued, to, worsen, gabriel, bethlen, calvinist, prince, of, transylvania, invaded, hungary, with, ottoman, support, although, the, habsburgs, persuaded, them, to, avoid, direct, involvement, this, was, helped, when, the, ottomans, became, involved, in, the, 1620, polish, war, followed, by, the, 1623, to, 1639, conflict, with, persia, on, 19, august, the, bohemian, estates, rescinded, ferdinand, s, 1617, election, as, king, on, the, 26th, they, formally, offered, the, crown, to, frederick, two, days, later, ferdinand, was, elected, emperor, making, war, inevitable, if, frederick, accepted, the, bohemian, crown, most, of, frederick, s, advisors, urged, him, to, reject, it, as, did, the, duke, of, savoy, and, his, father, in, law, james, i, the, exceptions, included, christian, of, anhalt, and, maurice, of, orange, for, whom, conflict, in, germany, was, a, means, to, divert, spanish, resources, from, the, netherlands, the, dutch, offered, subsidies, to, frederick, and, the, protestant, union, helped, raise, loans, for, bohemia, and, provided, weapons, and, munitions, however, wider, european, support, failed, to, materialise, largely, due, to, lack, of, enthusiasm, for, removing, a, legally, elected, ruler, regardless, of, religion, although, frederick, accepted, the, crown, and, entered, prague, in, october, 1619, his, support, eroded, over, the, next, few, months, in, july, 1620, the, protestant, union, proclaimed, its, neutrality, while, john, george, of, saxony, backed, ferdinand, in, return, for, the, cession, of, lusatia, and, a, guarantee, of, lutheran, rights, in, bohemia, maximilian, of, bavaria, funded, a, combined, imperial, catholic, league, army, led, by, count, tilly, and, charles, of, bucquoy, which, pacified, upper, and, lower, austria, and, occupied, western, bohemia, before, marching, on, prague, defeated, by, tilly, at, the, battle, of, white, mountain, in, november, 1620, the, bohemian, army, disintegrated, and, frederick, was, forced, to, flee, the, country, by, abandoning, frederick, the, german, princes, hoped, to, restrict, the, dispute, to, bohemia, but, maximilian, s, dynastic, ambitions, made, this, impossible, in, the, october, 1619, treaty, of, munich, ferdinand, transferred, the, palatinate, s, electoral, vote, to, bavaria, and, allowed, maximilian, to, annex, the, upper, palatinate, many, protestant, rulers, had, supported, ferdinand, against, frederick, because, they, objected, to, deposing, the, legally, elected, king, of, bohemia, on, the, same, grounds, they, viewed, frederick, s, removal, as, an, infringement, of, german, liberties, while, for, catholics, it, presented, an, opportunity, to, regain, lands, and, properties, lost, since, 1555, the, combination, destabilised, large, parts, of, the, empire, at, the, same, time, the, strategic, importance, of, the, spanish, road, to, their, war, in, the, netherlands, and, its, proximity, to, the, palatinate, drew, in, the, spanish, when, an, army, led, by, c, rdoba, occupied, the, lower, palatinate, in, october, 1619, james, i, responded, to, this, attack, on, his, son, in, law, english, naval, forces, were, sent, to, threaten, spanish, possessions, in, the, americas, and, the, mediterranean, while, james, announced, he, would, declare, war, if, spanish, troops, were, not, withdrawn, by, spring, 1621, these, actions, were, primarily, designed, to, placate, his, opponents, in, parliament, who, considered, his, pro, spanish, policy, a, betrayal, of, the, protestant, cause, however, spanish, chief, minister, olivares, correctly, interpreted, them, as, an, invitation, to, open, negotiations, and, in, return, for, an, anglo, spanish, alliance, offered, to, restore, frederick, to, his, rhineland, possessions, since, frederick, s, demand, for, full, restitution, of, his, lands, and, titles, was, incompatible, with, the, treaty, of, munich, hopes, of, a, negotiated, peace, quickly, evaporated, despite, defeat, in, bohemia, frederick, s, allies, included, georg, friedrich, of, baden, and, christian, of, brunswick, while, the, dutch, provided, him, with, military, support, after, the, eighty, years, war, restarted, in, april, 1621, and, his, father, in, law, james, funded, an, army, of, mercenaries, under, mansfeld, however, their, failure, to, co, ordinate, effectively, led, to, a, series, of, defeats, by, spanish, and, catholic, league, forces, including, wimpfen, in, may, 1622, and, h, chst, in, june, by, november, 1622, the, imperials, controlled, most, of, the, palatinate, apart, from, frankenthal, which, was, held, by, a, small, english, garrison, under, sir, horace, vere, the, remnants, of, mansfeld, s, army, took, refuge, in, the, dutch, republic, as, did, frederick, who, spent, most, of, his, time, in, the, hague, until, his, death, in, november, 1632, at, a, meeting, of, the, imperial, diet, in, february, 1623, ferdinand, forced, through, provisions, transferring, frederick, s, titles, lands, and, electoral, vote, to, maximilian, he, did, so, with, support, from, the, catholic, league, despite, strong, opposition, from, protestant, members, as, well, as, the, spanish, the, palatinate, was, clearly, lost, in, march, james, instructed, vere, to, surrender, frankenthal, while, tilly, s, victory, over, christian, of, brunswick, at, stadtlohn, in, august, completed, military, operations, however, spanish, and, dutch, involvement, in, the, campaign, was, a, significant, step, in, internationalising, the, war, while, frederick, s, removal, meant, other, protestant, princes, began, discussing, armed, resistance, to, preserve, their, own, rights, and, territories, with, saxony, dominating, the, upper, saxon, circle, and, brandenburg, the, lower, both, kreise, had, remained, neutral, during, the, campaigns, in, bohemia, and, the, palatinate, however, frederick, s, deposition, in, 1623, meant, john, george, of, saxony, and, the, calvinist, george, william, elector, of, brandenburg, became, concerned, ferdinand, intended, to, reclaim, formerly, catholic, bishoprics, currently, held, by, protestants, these, fears, seemed, confirmed, when, tilly, restored, the, roman, catholic, diocese, of, halberstadt, in, early, 1625, as, duke, of, holstein, christian, iv, was, also, a, member, of, the, lower, saxon, circle, while, the, danish, economy, relied, on, the, baltic, trade, and, tolls, from, traffic, through, the, resund, in, 1621, hamburg, accepted, danish, supervision, while, his, son, frederick, became, joint, administrator, of, l, beck, bremen, and, verden, possession, ensured, danish, control, of, the, elbe, and, weser, rivers, ferdinand, had, paid, albrecht, von, wallenstein, for, his, support, against, frederick, with, estates, confiscated, from, the, bohemian, rebels, and, now, contracted, with, him, to, conquer, the, north, on, a, similar, basis, in, may, 1625, the, lower, saxony, kreis, elected, christian, their, military, commander, although, not, without, resistance, saxony, and, brandenburg, viewed, denmark, and, sweden, as, competitors, and, wanted, to, avoid, either, becoming, involved, in, the, empire, attempts, to, negotiate, a, peaceful, solution, failed, as, the, conflict, in, germany, became, part, of, the, wider, struggle, between, france, and, their, habsburg, rivals, in, spain, and, austria, in, the, june, 1624, treaty, of, compi, gne, france, had, agreed, to, subsidise, the, dutch, war, against, spain, for, a, minimum, of, three, years, while, in, the, december, 1625, treaty, of, the, hague, the, dutch, and, english, agreed, to, finance, danish, intervention, in, the, empire, hoping, to, create, a, wider, coalition, against, ferdinand, the, dutch, invited, france, sweden, savoy, and, the, republic, of, venice, to, join, but, it, was, overtaken, by, events, in, early, 1626, cardinal, richelieu, main, architect, of, the, alliance, faced, a, new, huguenot, rebellion, at, home, and, in, the, march, treaty, of, monz, n, france, withdrew, from, northern, italy, re, opening, the, spanish, road, dutch, and, english, subsidies, enabled, christian, to, devise, an, ambitious, three, part, campaign, plan, while, he, led, the, main, force, down, the, weser, mansfeld, would, attack, wallenstein, in, magdeburg, supported, by, forces, led, by, christian, of, brunswick, and, maurice, of, hesse, kassel, the, advance, quickly, fell, apart, mansfeld, was, defeated, at, dessau, bridge, in, april, and, when, maurice, refused, to, support, him, christian, of, brunswick, fell, back, on, wolfenb, ttel, where, he, died, of, disease, shortly, after, the, danes, were, comprehensively, beaten, at, lutter, in, august, and, mansfeld, s, army, dissolved, following, his, death, in, november, many, of, christian, s, german, allies, such, as, hesse, kassel, and, saxony, had, little, interest, in, replacing, imperial, domination, with, danish, while, few, of, the, subsidies, agreed, to, by, the, treaty, of, the, hague, were, ever, paid, charles, i, of, england, allowed, christian, to, recruit, up, to, 9, 000, scottish, mercenaries, but, they, took, time, to, arrive, and, while, able, to, slow, wallenstein, s, advance, were, insufficient, to, stop, him, by, the, end, of, 1627, wallenstein, occupied, mecklenburg, pomerania, and, jutland, and, began, making, plans, to, construct, a, fleet, capable, of, challenging, danish, control, of, the, baltic, he, was, supported, by, spain, for, whom, it, provided, an, opportunity, to, open, another, front, against, the, dutch, on, 13, may, 1628, his, deputy, von, arnim, besieged, stralsund, the, only, port, with, facilities, large, enough, to, build, this, fleet, however, this, threat, led, gustavus, adolphus, to, send, several, thousand, scots, and, swedish, troops, to, stralsund, commanded, by, alexander, leslie, who, was, also, appointed, governor, von, arnim, was, forced, to, lift, the, siege, on, 4, august, but, three, weeks, later, christian, suffered, another, defeat, at, wolgast, he, began, negotiations, with, wallenstein, who, despite, his, recent, victories, was, concerned, by, the, prospect, of, swedish, intervention, and, thus, anxious, to, make, peace, with, austrian, resources, stretched, by, the, outbreak, of, the, war, of, the, mantuan, succession, wallenstein, persuaded, ferdinand, to, agree, with, relatively, lenient, terms, in, the, june, 1629, treaty, of, l, beck, christian, retained, his, german, possessions, of, schleswig, and, holstein, in, return, for, relinquishing, bremen, and, verden, and, abandoning, support, for, the, german, protestants, while, denmark, kept, schleswig, and, holstein, until, 1864, this, effectively, ended, its, reign, as, the, predominant, nordic, state, once, again, the, methods, used, to, obtain, victory, explain, why, the, war, failed, to, end, ferdinand, paid, wallenstein, by, letting, him, confiscate, estates, extort, ransoms, from, towns, and, allowing, his, men, to, plunder, the, lands, they, passed, through, regardless, of, whether, they, belonged, to, allies, or, opponents, in, early, 1628, ferdinand, deposed, the, hereditary, duke, of, mecklenburg, and, appointed, wallenstein, in, his, place, an, act, which, united, all, german, princes, in, opposition, regardless, of, religion, this, unity, was, undermined, by, maximilian, of, bavaria, s, desire, to, retain, the, palatinate, as, a, result, the, catholic, league, argued, only, for, a, return, to, the, position, prevailing, pre, 1627, while, protestants, wanted, that, of, 1618, made, overconfident, by, success, in, march, 1629, ferdinand, passed, an, edict, of, restitution, which, required, all, lands, taken, from, the, catholic, church, after, 1555, to, be, returned, while, technically, legal, politically, it, was, extremely, unwise, since, doing, so, would, alter, nearly, every, single, state, boundary, in, north, and, central, germany, deny, the, existence, of, calvinism, and, restore, catholicism, in, areas, where, it, had, not, been, a, significant, presence, for, nearly, a, century, well, aware, none, of, the, princes, involved, would, agree, ferdinand, used, the, device, of, an, imperial, edict, once, again, asserting, his, right, to, alter, laws, without, consultation, this, new, assault, on, german, liberties, ensured, continuing, opposition, and, undermined, his, previous, success, at, the, same, time, his, spanish, allies, were, reluctant, to, antagonise, german, protestants, as, their, war, in, the, spanish, netherlands, had, now, shifted, in, favour, of, the, dutch, republic, the, financial, predicament, of, the, spanish, crown, steadily, deteriorated, in, the, 1620s, particularly, after, the, dutch, west, india, company, captured, their, treasure, fleet, at, matanzas, in, 1628, the, war, of, the, mantuan, succession, further, diverted, spanish, resources, from, the, netherlands, while, the, loss, of, s, hertogenbosch, to, the, dutch, army, under, frederick, henry, in, 1629, caused, dismay, in, madrid, from, 1626, to, 1629, gustavus, was, engaged, in, a, war, with, poland, lithuania, ruled, by, his, catholic, cousin, sigismund, who, also, claimed, the, swedish, throne, and, had, imperial, support, once, this, conflict, ended, and, with, only, a, few, minor, states, like, hesse, kassel, still, openly, opposing, the, emperor, gustavus, became, an, obvious, ally, for, richelieu, in, september, 1629, the, latter, helped, negotiate, the, truce, of, altmark, between, sweden, and, poland, freeing, gustavus, to, enter, the, war, partly, a, genuine, desire, to, support, his, protestant, co, religionists, like, christian, he, also, wanted, to, maximise, his, share, of, the, baltic, trade, that, provided, much, of, sweden, s, income, following, failed, negotiations, with, the, emperor, gustavus, landed, in, pomerania, in, june, 1630, with, nearly, 18, 000, swedish, troops, using, stralsund, as, a, bridgehead, he, marched, south, along, the, oder, towards, stettin, and, coerced, bogislaw, xiv, duke, of, pomerania, into, agreeing, an, alliance, which, secured, his, interests, in, pomerania, against, his, rival, sigismund, as, a, result, the, poles, turned, their, attention, to, russia, initiating, the, 1632, to, 1634, smolensk, war, however, swedish, expectations, of, widespread, german, support, proved, unrealistic, by, the, end, of, 1630, their, only, new, ally, was, the, administrator, of, magdeburg, christian, william, whose, capital, was, under, siege, by, tilly, despite, the, devastation, inflicted, by, imperial, soldiers, saxony, and, brandenburg, had, their, own, ambitions, in, pomerania, which, clashed, with, those, of, gustavus, previous, experience, also, showed, inviting, external, powers, into, the, empire, was, easier, than, getting, them, to, leave, gustavus, put, pressure, on, brandenburg, by, sacking, k, strin, and, frankfurt, an, der, oder, while, the, sack, of, magdeburg, in, may, 1631, provided, a, powerful, warning, of, the, consequences, of, imperial, victory, once, again, richelieu, used, french, financial, power, to, bridge, differences, between, the, swedes, and, the, german, princes, the, 1631, treaty, of, b, rwalde, provided, funds, for, the, swedes, and, their, protestant, allies, including, saxony, and, brandenburg, these, amounted, to, 400, 000, reichstaler, per, year, or, one, million, livres, plus, an, additional, 120, 000, for, 1630, while, less, than, 2, of, total, french, income, these, payments, boosted, that, of, sweden, by, more, than, 25, and, allowed, gustavus, to, maintain, 36, 000, troops, gustavus, used, this, army, to, win, victories, at, breitenfeld, in, september, 1631, then, rain, in, april, 1632, where, tilly, was, killed, ferdinand, turned, once, again, to, wallenstein, who, realised, gustavus, was, overextended, and, established, himself, at, f, rth, from, where, he, could, threaten, his, supply, lines, this, led, to, the, battle, of, the, alte, veste, in, late, august, one, of, the, largest, battles, of, the, war, an, assault, on, the, imperial, camp, outside, the, town, was, bloodily, repulsed, arguably, the, greatest, blunder, committed, by, gustavus, during, his, german, campaign, two, months, later, the, swedes, and, imperials, met, at, l, tzen, where, both, sides, suffered, heavy, casualties, gustavus, himself, was, killed, while, some, swedish, units, incurred, losses, of, over, 60, fighting, continued, until, dusk, when, wallenstein, retreated, abandoning, his, artillery, and, wounded, despite, their, losses, this, allowed, the, swedes, to, claim, victory, although, the, result, continues, to, be, disputed, after, his, death, gustavus, policies, were, continued, by, his, chancellor, axel, oxenstierna, and, with, french, backing, sweden, and, their, german, allies, formed, the, heilbronn, league, in, april, 1633, in, july, their, combined, forces, defeated, an, imperial, army, under, bronckhorst, gronsfeld, at, oldendorf, critics, claimed, this, defeat, was, caused, by, wallenstein, s, failure, to, support, the, bavarians, while, rumours, spread, that, he, was, preparing, to, switch, sides, as, a, result, emperor, ferdinand, ordered, his, arrest, in, february, 1634, and, on, 25th, he, was, assassinated, by, his, own, officers, in, cheb, the, loss, of, wallenstein, and, his, organisation, left, emperor, ferdinand, reliant, on, spain, for, military, support, since, their, main, concern, was, to, re, open, the, spanish, road, for, their, campaign, against, the, dutch, the, focus, of, the, war, now, shifted, from, the, north, to, the, rhineland, and, bavaria, cardinal, infante, ferdinand, of, austria, new, governor, of, the, spanish, netherlands, raised, an, army, of, 18, 000, in, italy, which, met, up, with, an, imperial, force, of, 15, 000, at, donauw, rth, on, 2, september, 1634, four, days, later, they, won, a, decisive, victory, at, n, rdlingen, which, destroyed, swedish, power, in, southern, germany, and, led, to, the, defection, of, their, german, allies, who, now, sought, to, make, peace, with, the, emperor, swedish, defeat, at, n, rdlingen, triggered, direct, french, intervention, and, thus, expanded, the, conflict, rather, than, ending, it, richelieu, provided, the, swedes, with, new, subsidies, hired, mercenaries, led, by, bernard, of, saxe, weimar, for, an, offensive, in, the, rhineland, and, in, may, 1635, declared, war, on, spain, starting, the, 1635, to, 1659, franco, spanish, war, a, few, days, later, the, german, states, and, ferdinand, agreed, to, the, peace, of, prague, in, return, for, withdrawing, the, edict, of, restitution, the, heilbronn, and, catholic, leagues, were, dissolved, and, replaced, by, a, single, imperial, army, although, saxony, and, bavaria, retained, control, of, their, own, forces, this, is, generally, seen, as, the, point, when, the, war, ceased, to, be, a, primarily, inter, german, religious, conflict, in, march, 1635, french, soldiers, entered, the, valtellina, cutting, the, link, between, spanish, controlled, milan, and, the, empire, in, may, their, main, army, of, 35, 000, invaded, the, spanish, netherlands, but, withdrew, in, july, after, suffering, 17, 000, casualties, in, march, 1636, france, joined, the, thirty, years, war, as, an, ally, of, sweden, whose, loss, of, most, of, the, territories, gained, by, gustavus, and, their, taxes, made, it, increasingly, reliant, on, french, financing, the, spanish, then, invaded, northern, france, causing, panic, in, paris, before, lack, of, supplies, forced, them, to, retreat, a, swedish, army, under, johan, ban, r, defeated, the, imperials, at, wittstock, on, 4, october, and, re, established, their, predominance, in, north, east, germany, despite, the, defection, of, most, of, their, german, allies, ferdinand, ii, died, in, february, 1637, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, ferdinand, iii, who, faced, a, deteriorating, military, position, although, matthias, gallas, and, the, main, imperial, army, had, forced, ban, r, back, to, the, baltic, in, march, 1638, bernard, destroyed, an, imperial, army, at, rheinfelden, his, capture, of, breisach, in, december, secured, french, control, of, alsace, and, severed, the, spanish, road, forcing, gallas, to, divert, resources, there, although, von, hatzfeldt, defeated, a, combined, swedish, german, force, at, vlotho, in, october, lack, of, supplies, forced, gallas, to, withdraw, from, the, baltic, in, april, 1639, ban, r, defeated, the, saxons, at, chemnitz, then, entered, bohemia, in, may, to, retrieve, the, situation, ferdinand, diverted, piccolomini, s, army, from, thionville, ending, direct, military, cooperation, between, austria, and, spain, pressure, grew, on, olivares, to, make, peace, especially, after, french, and, swedish, gains, in, germany, cut, the, spanish, road, forcing, madrid, to, resupply, their, armies, in, flanders, by, sea, however, their, attempts, to, re, assert, maritime, control, ended, when, the, dutch, fleet, under, maarten, tromp, won, a, significant, victory, at, the, downs, in, october, 1639, spanish, inability, to, adequately, supply, their, troops, allowed, the, french, to, over, run, artois, in, 1640, at, the, same, time, continuing, dutch, attacks, on, portuguese, colonies, and, opposition, to, heavy, taxes, led, to, revolts, in, both, portugal, and, catalonia, olivares, now, argued, spain, should, accept, dutch, independence, and, focus, on, preventing, further, french, gains, in, the, spanish, netherlands, this, appeared, achievable, since, most, of, the, dutch, regenten, believed, the, war, was, won, the, only, question, being, the, price, of, peace, they, therefore, reduced, the, army, budget, for, 1640, despite, objections, from, frederick, henry, after, bernard, died, in, july, 1639, his, troops, joined, ban, r, s, swedish, army, on, an, ineffectual, campaign, along, the, weser, the, highlight, being, a, surprise, attack, in, january, 1641, on, the, imperial, diet, in, regensburg, forced, to, retreat, ban, r, reached, halberstadt, in, may, where, he, died, and, despite, beating, off, an, imperial, force, at, wolfenb, ttel, in, june, his, largely, german, troops, mutinied, due, to, lack, of, pay, the, situation, was, saved, by, the, arrival, of, lennart, torstensson, in, november, with, 7, 000, swedish, recruits, and, enough, cash, to, satisfy, the, mutineers, french, victory, at, kempen, in, january, 1642, was, followed, by, second, breitenfeld, in, october, 1642, where, torstensson, inflicted, almost, 10, 000, casualties, on, an, imperial, army, led, by, archduke, leopold, wilhelm, of, austria, the, capture, of, leipzig, in, december, gave, the, swedes, a, significant, new, base, in, germany, and, despite, their, failure, to, take, freiberg, by, 1643, the, saxon, army, had, been, reduced, to, a, few, isolated, garrisons, while, ferdinand, accepted, a, military, solution, was, no, longer, possible, by, fighting, on, he, hoped, to, prevent, the, imperial, estates, joining, his, peace, negotiations, with, france, and, sweden, thus, preserving, his, authority, by, allowing, him, to, represent, the, empire, as, a, whole, this, seemed, more, likely, when, richelieu, died, in, december, 1642, followed, by, louis, xiii, in, may, 1643, leaving, his, five, year, old, son, louis, xiv, as, king, however, richelieu, s, policies, were, continued, by, his, successor, cardinal, mazarin, while, gains, in, alsace, allowed, france, to, focus, on, the, war, against, spain, in, 1643, the, army, of, flanders, invaded, northern, france, hoping, to, relieve, pressure, elsewhere, but, were, decisively, beaten, by, cond, at, rocroi, on, 19, may, defeat, ended, any, prospect, of, re, opening, the, spanish, road, and, madrid, finally, accepted, the, war, against, the, dutch, could, not, be, won, however, cond, was, unable, to, fully, exploit, his, victory, due, to, factors, affecting, all, combatants, the, devastation, inflicted, by, 25, years, of, warfare, meant, armies, spent, more, time, foraging, than, fighting, forcing, them, to, become, smaller, and, more, mobile, with, a, much, greater, emphasis, on, cavalry, difficulties, in, gathering, provisions, meant, campaigns, started, later, and, restricted, them, to, areas, that, could, be, easily, supplied, usually, close, to, rivers, in, addition, the, french, had, to, rebuild, their, army, in, germany, after, it, was, shattered, by, an, imperial, bavarian, force, led, by, franz, von, mercy, at, tuttlingen, in, november, soon, after, rocroi, ferdinand, invited, sweden, and, france, to, attend, peace, talks, in, the, westphalian, towns, of, m, nster, and, osnabr, ck, but, negotiations, were, delayed, when, christian, of, denmark, blockaded, hamburg, and, increased, toll, payments, in, the, baltic, this, severely, impacted, the, dutch, and, swedish, economies, and, in, december, 1643, the, torstensson, war, began, when, the, swedes, invaded, jutland, with, dutch, naval, support, ferdinand, pulled, together, an, imperial, army, under, gallas, to, attack, the, swedes, from, the, rear, which, proved, a, disastrous, decision, leaving, wrangel, to, finish, the, war, in, denmark, in, may, 1644, torstensson, marched, into, the, empire, gallas, was, unable, to, stop, him, while, the, danes, sued, for, peace, after, their, defeat, at, fehmarn, in, october, 1644, in, august, 1644, the, french, and, bavarian, armies, met, in, the, three, day, battle, of, freiburg, in, which, both, sides, suffered, heavy, casualties, convinced, the, war, could, no, longer, be, won, maximilian, now, put, pressure, on, ferdinand, to, end, the, conflict, shortly, after, peace, talks, restarted, in, november, gallas, imperial, army, disintegrated, and, the, remnants, retreated, into, bohemia, where, they, were, scattered, by, torstensson, at, jankau, in, march, 1645, in, may, a, bavarian, force, under, von, mercy, destroyed, a, french, detachment, at, herbsthausen, before, he, was, defeated, and, killed, at, second, n, rdlingen, in, august, deprived, of, imperial, support, john, george, of, saxony, signed, a, six, month, truce, with, sweden, in, september, and, in, the, march, 1646, treaty, of, eulenberg, agreed, to, remain, neutral, until, the, end, of, the, war, under, turenne, french, commander, in, the, rhineland, and, wrangel, who, had, replaced, torstensson, the, french, and, swedes, separately, invaded, bavaria, in, the, summer, of, 1646, maximilian, was, soon, desperate, to, end, the, war, he, was, largely, responsible, for, starting, at, which, point, the, spanish, publicised, a, secret, offer, by, mazarin, to, exchange, french, occupied, catalonia, for, the, spanish, netherlands, angered, by, this, duplicity, the, dutch, agreed, a, truce, with, spain, in, january, 1647, and, began, to, negotiate, their, own, peace, terms, having, failed, to, acquire, the, netherlands, through, diplomacy, mazarin, decided, to, do, so, by, force, to, free, up, resources, for, the, attempt, on, 14, march, 1647, he, signed, the, truce, of, ulm, with, bavaria, cologne, and, sweden, the, planned, offensive, fell, apart, when, turenne, s, mostly, german, troops, mutinied, while, bavarian, general, johann, von, werth, refused, to, comply, with, the, truce, although, the, mutinies, were, quickly, suppressed, maximilian, felt, obliged, to, follow, werth, s, example, and, in, september, ordered, bronckhorst, gronsfeld, to, combine, the, remnants, of, the, bavarian, army, with, imperial, troops, under, von, holzappel, outnumbered, by, a, franco, swedish, army, led, by, wrangel, and, turenne, they, were, defeated, at, zusmarshausen, in, may, 1648, and, von, holzappel, was, killed, although, the, bulk, of, the, imperial, army, escaped, thanks, to, an, effective, rearguard, action, by, raimondo, montecuccoli, bavaria, was, left, defenceless, once, again, the, swedes, sent, a, second, force, under, von, k, nigsmarck, to, attack, prague, seizing, the, castle, and, mal, strana, district, in, july, the, main, objective, was, to, gain, as, much, loot, as, possible, before, the, war, ended, they, failed, to, take, the, old, town, but, captured, the, imperial, library, along, with, treasures, including, the, codex, gigas, now, in, stockholm, when, a, spanish, offensive, in, flanders, ended, with, defeat, at, lens, in, august, 1648, ferdinand, finally, agreed, terms, and, on, 24, october, he, signed, peace, treaties, with, france, and, sweden, ending, the, war, northern, italy, had, been, contested, by, france, and, the, habsburgs, since, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, one, reason, was, control, of, this, area, allowed, opponents, to, threaten, the, southern, borders, of, france, and, austria, in, addition, it, contained, large, sections, of, the, spanish, road, which, allowed, spain, to, safely, move, recruits, and, supplies, from, their, italian, possessions, to, support, their, war, against, the, dutch, this, reliance, on, long, exterior, lines, of, communication, was, a, strategic, weakness, which, the, french, sought, to, exploit, by, disrupting, the, road, this, usually, involved, attacks, on, the, spanish, held, duchy, of, milan, or, blocking, the, alpine, passes, montferrat, and, its, fortress, of, casale, monferrato, were, subsidiary, territories, of, the, duchy, of, mantua, and, their, possession, allowed, the, holder, to, threaten, milan, this, meant, when, the, last, duke, in, the, direct, line, died, in, december, 1627, france, and, spain, backed, rival, claimants, resulting, in, the, 1628, to, 1631, war, of, the, mantuan, succession, the, french, born, duke, of, nevers, was, backed, by, france, and, the, republic, of, venice, his, rival, the, duke, of, guastalla, by, spain, ferdinand, ii, savoy, and, tuscany, while, a, relatively, minor, conflict, the, struggle, had, a, disproportionate, impact, on, the, thirty, years, war, since, pope, urban, viii, viewed, habsburg, expansion, in, italy, as, a, threat, to, the, papal, states, his, opposition, to, ferdinand, ii, divided, the, catholic, powers, and, made, it, acceptable, for, france, to, employ, protestant, allies, against, austria, in, march, 1629, the, french, stormed, savoyard, positions, in, the, pas, de, suse, lifted, the, spanish, siege, of, casale, and, captured, pinerolo, the, treaty, of, suza, then, ceded, the, two, fortresses, to, france, and, allowed, their, troops, unrestricted, passage, through, savoyard, territory, giving, them, control, over, piedmont, and, the, alpine, passes, into, southern, france, however, as, soon, as, the, main, french, army, withdrew, in, late, 1629, the, spanish, and, savoyards, besieged, casale, once, again, at, the, same, time, the, spanish, employed, mercenaries, paid, for, by, ferdinand, ii, in, an, offensive, which, routed, the, main, venetian, field, army, and, forced, nevers, to, abandon, mantua, by, october, 1630, the, french, position, seemed, so, precarious, their, representatives, agreed, the, treaty, of, ratisbon, but, it, was, never, ratified, as, richelieu, claimed, he, had, never, approved, the, terms, several, factors, restored, the, french, position, in, northern, italy, notably, a, devastating, outbreak, of, plague, between, 1629, and, 1631, over, 60, 000, died, in, milan, and, 46, 000, in, venice, with, proportionate, losses, elsewhere, richelieu, took, advantage, of, the, diversion, of, imperial, resources, to, fund, a, swedish, invasion, of, germany, whose, success, forced, the, spanish, savoyard, alliance, to, withdraw, from, casale, and, sign, the, treaty, of, cherasco, in, april, 1631, nevers, was, confirmed, as, duke, of, mantua, and, although, richelieu, s, representative, cardinal, mazarin, agreed, to, evacuate, pinerolo, it, was, later, secretly, returned, under, an, agreement, with, victor, amadeus, i, duke, of, savoy, with, the, exception, of, the, 1639, to, 1642, piedmontese, civil, war, this, secured, the, french, position, in, northern, italy, for, the, next, twenty, years, after, the, outbreak, of, the, franco, spanish, war, in, 1635, richelieu, supported, a, renewed, offensive, by, victor, amadeus, against, milan, to, tie, down, spanish, resources, these, included, an, unsuccessful, attack, on, valenza, in, 1635, plus, minor, victories, at, tornavento, and, mombaldone, however, the, anti, habsburg, alliance, in, northern, italy, fell, apart, when, first, charles, of, mantua, died, in, september, 1637, then, victor, amadeus, in, october, whose, death, led, to, a, struggle, for, control, of, the, savoyard, state, between, his, widow, christine, of, france, and, brothers, thomas, and, maurice, in, 1639, their, quarrel, erupted, into, open, warfare, with, france, backing, christine, and, spain, the, two, brothers, and, resulted, in, the, siege, of, turin, one, of, the, most, famous, military, events, of, the, 17th, century, at, one, stage, it, featured, no, less, than, three, different, armies, besieging, each, other, however, the, revolts, in, portugal, and, catalonia, forced, the, spanish, to, cease, operations, in, italy, and, the, war, was, settled, on, terms, favourable, to, christine, and, france, in, 1647, a, french, backed, rebellion, succeeded, in, temporarily, overthrowing, spanish, rule, in, naples, the, spanish, quickly, crushed, the, insurrection, and, restored, their, rule, over, all, of, southern, italy, defeating, multiple, french, expeditionary, forces, sent, to, back, the, rebels, however, it, exposed, the, weakness, of, spanish, rule, in, italy, and, the, alienation, of, the, local, elites, from, madrid, in, 1650, the, governor, of, milan, wrote, that, as, well, as, widespread, dissatisfaction, in, the, south, the, only, one, of, the, italian, states, that, could, be, relied, on, was, the, duchy, of, parma, throughout, the, 1630s, tax, increases, levied, to, pay, for, the, war, led, to, protests, throughout, spanish, territories, which, in, 1640, resulted, in, revolts, first, in, portugal, then, in, the, principality, of, catalonia, backed, by, france, as, part, of, richelieu, s, war, by, diversion, in, january, 1641, the, rebels, proclaimed, a, catalan, republic, the, madrid, government, quickly, assembled, an, army, of, 26, 000, men, to, crush, the, revolt, which, defeated, the, rebels, at, martorell, on, 23, january, 1641, the, french, now, persuaded, the, catalan, courts, to, recognise, louis, xiii, as, count, of, barcelona, and, ruler, of, catalonia, on, 26, january, a, combined, french, catalan, force, routed, a, larger, spanish, army, at, montju, c, and, secured, barcelona, however, the, rebels, soon, found, the, new, french, administration, differed, little, from, the, old, turning, the, war, into, a, three, sided, contest, between, the, franco, catalan, elite, the, rural, peasantry, and, the, spanish, there, was, little, serious, fighting, after, france, took, control, of, perpignan, and, roussillon, establishing, the, current, day, franco, spanish, border, in, the, pyrenees, the, revolt, ended, in, 1651, with, the, spanish, capture, of, barcelona, in, 1580, philip, ii, of, spain, also, became, ruler, of, the, portuguese, empire, creating, the, iberian, union, long, standing, commercial, rivals, the, 1602, to, 1663, dutch, portuguese, war, was, an, offshoot, of, the, dutch, fight, for, independence, from, spain, the, portuguese, dominated, the, trans, atlantic, economy, known, as, the, triangular, trade, in, which, slaves, were, transported, from, west, africa, and, portuguese, angola, to, work, on, plantations, in, portuguese, brazil, which, exported, sugar, and, tobacco, to, europe, known, by, dutch, historians, as, the, great, design, control, of, this, trade, would, not, only, be, extremely, profitable, but, also, deprive, the, spanish, of, funds, needed, to, finance, their, war, in, the, netherlands, in, 1621, the, dutch, west, india, company, was, formed, to, achieve, this, and, a, dutch, fleet, captured, the, brazilian, port, of, salvador, bahia, in, 1624, after, it, was, retaken, by, the, portuguese, in, 1625, a, second, fleet, established, dutch, brazil, in, 1630, which, was, not, returned, until, 1654, in, 1641, the, dutch, seized, portuguese, slave, trading, hubs, in, angola, and, s, o, tom, with, support, from, the, kingdoms, of, kongo, and, ndongo, whose, position, was, threatened, by, portuguese, expansion, although, those, gains, proved, short, lived, the, dutch, retained, territories, elsewhere, like, the, cape, colony, as, well, as, portuguese, trading, posts, on, the, gold, coast, in, malacca, on, the, malabar, coast, the, moluccas, and, ceylon, the, peace, of, westphalia, actually, consisted, of, three, separate, agreements, the, peace, of, m, nster, between, spain, and, the, dutch, republic, the, treaty, of, osnabr, ck, between, the, empire, and, sweden, plus, the, treaty, of, m, nster, between, the, empire, and, france, preliminary, discussions, began, in, 1642, but, only, became, serious, in, 1646, a, total, of, 109, delegations, attended, at, one, time, or, other, with, talks, split, between, m, nster, and, osnabr, ck, after, the, swedes, rejected, christian, of, denmark, as, mediator, the, negotiators, finally, agreed, on, papal, legate, fabio, chigi, and, the, venetian, envoy, alvise, contarini, the, first, to, be, signed, on, 30, january, 1648, the, peace, of, m, nster, forms, part, of, the, westphalia, settlement, since, the, dutch, republic, was, still, considered, imperial, territory, although, it, officially, confirmed, dutch, independence, the, imperial, diet, did, not, formally, accept, it, was, no, longer, part, of, the, empire, until, 1728, the, dutch, were, also, given, a, monopoly, over, trade, conducted, through, the, scheldt, estuary, ensuring, the, commercial, ascendancy, of, amsterdam, antwerp, capital, of, the, spanish, netherlands, and, previously, the, most, important, port, in, northern, europe, would, not, recover, until, the, late, 19th, century, the, terms, of, the, separate, treaties, with, france, and, sweden, had, first, to, be, agreed, by, ferdinand, and, the, imperial, estates, it, has, been, argued, they, were, a, major, turning, point, in, german, and, european, legal, history, because, they, went, beyond, normal, peace, settlements, and, effected, major, constitutional, and, religious, changes, to, the, empire, itself, since, they, required, changes, to, the, structure, and, governance, of, the, empire, these, negotiations, were, complex, with, states, like, saxony, and, bavaria, having, very, different, views, on, desired, outcomes, ferdinand, finally, signed, the, peace, on, 24, october, after, a, crushing, french, victory, over, spain, at, lens, and, with, swedish, troops, on, the, verge, of, taking, prague, key, elements, of, the, peace, were, provisions, confirming, the, autonomy, of, states, within, the, empire, including, ferdinand, s, acceptance, of, the, supremacy, of, the, imperial, diet, and, those, seeking, to, prevent, future, religious, conflict, article, 5, reconfirmed, the, augsburg, settlement, established, 1624, as, the, basis, or, normaljahr, for, determining, the, dominant, religion, of, a, state, and, guaranteed, freedom, of, worship, for, religious, minorities, article, 7, recognised, calvinism, as, a, reformed, faith, and, removed, the, ius, reformandi, the, requirement, that, if, a, ruler, changed, his, religion, his, subjects, had, to, follow, suit, these, terms, did, not, apply, to, the, hereditary, lands, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, such, as, lower, and, upper, austria, in, terms, of, territorial, concessions, brandenburg, prussia, received, farther, pomerania, and, the, bishoprics, of, magdeburg, halberstadt, kammin, and, minden, frederick, s, son, charles, louis, regained, the, lower, palatinate, and, became, the, eighth, imperial, elector, although, bavaria, kept, the, upper, palatinate, and, its, electoral, vote, externally, spain, acknowledged, the, independence, of, the, dutch, republic, while, the, emperor, confirmed, that, of, the, old, swiss, confederacy, effectively, an, autonomous, part, of, the, empire, since, 1499, in, lorraine, the, three, bishoprics, of, metz, toul, and, verdun, occupied, by, france, since, 1552, were, formally, ceded, as, were, the, cities, of, the, d, capole, in, alsace, with, the, exception, of, strasbourg, and, mulhouse, sweden, received, an, indemnity, of, five, million, thalers, the, imperial, territories, of, swedish, pomerania, and, the, prince, bishoprics, of, bremen, and, verden, which, also, gave, them, a, seat, in, the, imperial, diet, the, peace, was, later, denounced, by, pope, innocent, x, who, regarded, the, bishoprics, ceded, to, france, and, brandenburg, as, property, of, the, catholic, church, and, thus, his, to, assign, it, also, disappointed, many, exiles, by, accepting, catholicism, as, the, dominant, religion, in, bohemia, upper, and, lower, austria, all, of, which, were, protestant, strongholds, prior, to, 1618, fighting, did, not, end, immediately, since, demobilising, over, 200, 000, soldiers, was, a, complex, business, and, the, last, swedish, garrison, did, not, leave, germany, until, 1654, in, addition, mazarin, insisted, on, excluding, the, burgundian, circle, from, the, treaty, of, m, nster, allowing, france, to, continue, its, campaign, against, spain, in, the, low, countries, a, war, that, continued, until, the, 1659, treaty, of, the, pyrenees, the, political, disintegration, of, poland, lithuania, led, to, the, 1655, to, 1660, second, northern, war, with, sweden, which, also, involved, denmark, russia, and, brandenburg, while, two, swedish, attempts, to, impose, its, control, on, the, port, of, bremen, failed, in, 1654, and, 1666, it, has, been, argued, the, peace, established, the, principle, known, as, westphalian, sovereignty, the, idea, of, non, interference, in, domestic, affairs, by, outside, powers, although, this, has, since, been, challenged, the, process, or, congress, model, was, adopted, for, negotiations, at, aix, la, chapelle, in, 1668, nijmegen, in, 1678, and, ryswick, in, 1697, unlike, the, 19th, century, congress, system, these, were, to, end, wars, rather, than, prevent, them, so, references, to, the, balance, of, power, can, be, misleading, the, thirty, years, war, forms, part, of, what, historians, sometimes, call, the, general, crisis, of, the, mid, 17th, century, this, term, refers, to, a, period, of, sustained, conflict, and, unrest, in, areas, ranging, from, ming, china, to, the, british, isles, tsarist, russia, and, the, holy, roman, empire, in, each, of, these, fighting, combined, with, famine, and, disease, inflicted, severe, losses, on, local, civilian, populations, while, the, war, certainly, ranks, as, one, of, the, worst, of, these, events, 19th, century, german, nationalists, often, exaggerated, its, impact, to, illustrate, the, dangers, of, a, divided, germany, suggestions, of, up, to, 12, million, deaths, from, a, population, of, 18, million, are, no, longer, considered, accurate, in, addition, upper, estimates, of, material, losses, are, not, supported, by, contemporary, evidence, or, in, some, cases, exceed, prewar, tax, records, regardless, modern, commentators, agree, the, war, was, a, mortality, disaster, previously, unknown, in, europe, estimates, of, total, deaths, range, from, 4, 5, to, 8, million, most, incurred, after, 1630, when, sweden, entered, the, war, the, vast, majority, of, which, were, civilian, battles, generally, featured, armies, of, around, 13, 000, to, 20, 000, each, one, of, the, largest, being, alte, veste, in, 1632, with, a, combined, 70, 000, to, 85, 000, estimates, of, the, total, deployed, by, both, sides, within, germany, range, from, an, average, of, 80, 000, to, 100, 000, from, 1618, to, 1626, peaking, at, 250, 000, in, 1632, and, falling, to, under, 160, 000, by, 1648, casualty, rates, among, those, who, actually, did, serve, in, the, military, could, be, extremely, high, of, 230, men, conscripted, from, the, swedish, village, of, bygde, between, 1621, and, 1639, 215, are, recorded, as, dead, or, missing, while, another, five, returned, home, crippled, aggregating, figures, from, known, battles, and, sieges, historian, peter, wilson, estimates, those, either, killed, or, wounded, in, combat, totalled, around, 450, 000, since, research, shows, disease, either, killed, or, incapacitated, two, to, three, times, that, number, that, would, suggest, military, casualties, ranged, from, 1, 3, to, 1, 8, million, dead, or, otherwise, rendered, unfit, for, service, although, his, methodology, has, been, disputed, pitirim, sorokin, calculates, an, upper, limit, of, 2, 071, 000, military, casualties, based, on, local, records, military, action, accounted, for, less, than, 3, of, civilian, deaths, with, the, major, causes, being, starvation, 12, bubonic, plague, 64, typhus, 4, and, dysentery, 5, although, regular, outbreaks, of, disease, were, common, for, decades, prior, to, 1618, the, conflict, greatly, accelerated, their, spread, due, to, the, influx, of, soldiers, from, foreign, countries, the, shifting, locations, of, battle, fronts, and, displacement, of, rural, populations, into, already, crowded, cities, this, was, not, restricted, to, germany, disease, carried, by, french, and, imperial, soldiers, allegedly, sparked, the, 1629, 1631, italian, plague, described, as, the, worst, mortality, crisis, to, affect, italy, during, the, early, modern, period, it, resulted, in, some, 280, 000, deaths, with, higher, estimates, of, around, 1, million, poor, harvests, throughout, the, 1630s, and, repeated, plundering, of, the, same, areas, led, to, widespread, famine, contemporaries, record, people, eating, grass, or, too, weak, to, accept, alms, while, instances, of, cannibalism, were, common, modern, historians, generally, agree, the, holy, roman, empire, experienced, an, overall, population, decline, of, between, 30, to, 40, although, this, was, not, evenly, spread, it, fell, from, between, 18, and, 20, million, in, 1600, to, between, 11, and, 13, million, in, 1650, and, did, not, regain, pre, war, levels, until, 1750, nearly, 50, of, these, losses, appear, to, have, been, incurred, during, the, first, period, of, swedish, intervention, from, 1630, to, 1635, the, high, mortality, rate, compared, to, the, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, in, britain, may, partly, be, due, to, the, reliance, of, all, sides, on, foreign, mercenaries, often, unpaid, and, required, to, live, off, the, land, lack, of, a, sense, of, shared, community, resulted, in, atrocities, such, as, the, destruction, of, magdeburg, in, turn, creating, large, numbers, of, refugees, who, were, extremely, susceptible, to, sickness, and, hunger, while, flight, saved, lives, in, the, short, term, in, the, long, run, it, often, proved, catastrophic, in, 1940, agrarian, historian, g, nther, franz, published, a, detailed, analysis, of, regional, data, from, across, germany, covering, the, period, from, 1618, to, 1648, broadly, confirmed, by, more, recent, work, he, concluded, about, 40, of, the, rural, population, fell, victim, to, the, war, and, epidemics, in, the, cities, 33, these, figures, can, be, misleading, since, franz, calculated, the, absolute, decline, in, pre, and, post, war, populations, or, total, demographic, loss, they, therefore, include, factors, unrelated, to, death, or, disease, such, as, permanent, migration, to, areas, outside, the, empire, or, lower, birthrates, a, common, but, less, obvious, impact, of, extended, warfare, there, were, also, wide, regional, variations, some, areas, in, northwest, germany, were, relatively, peaceful, after, 1630, and, experienced, almost, no, population, loss, while, those, of, mecklenburg, pomerania, and, w, rttemberg, fell, by, nearly, 50, although, some, towns, may, have, overstated, their, losses, to, avoid, taxes, individual, records, confirm, serious, declines, from, 1620, to, 1650, the, population, of, munich, fell, from, 22, 000, to, 17, 000, that, of, augsburg, from, 48, 000, to, 21, 000, the, financial, impact, is, less, clear, while, the, war, caused, short, term, economic, dislocation, especially, in, the, period, 1618, to, 1623, overall, it, accelerated, existing, changes, in, trading, patterns, it, does, not, appear, to, have, reversed, ongoing, macro, economic, trends, such, as, the, reduction, of, price, differentials, between, regional, markets, and, a, greater, degree, of, market, integration, across, europe, the, death, toll, may, have, improved, living, standards, for, the, survivors, one, study, shows, wages, in, germany, increased, by, 40, in, real, terms, between, 1603, and, 1652, innovations, made, by, gustavus, in, particular, are, considered, part, of, the, tactical, evolution, known, as, the, military, revolution, although, whether, tactics, or, technology, were, at, the, heart, of, these, changes, is, still, debated, introduced, by, maurice, of, orange, in, the, 1590s, these, sought, to, increase, infantry, firepower, by, moving, from, massed, columns, to, line, formation, gustavus, further, reduced, the, ten, ranks, used, by, maurice, to, six, and, increased, the, proportion, of, musketeers, to, pikemen, he, also, enhanced, their, firepower, by, providing, each, unit, with, quick, firing, light, artillery, pieces, on, either, flank, the, best, example, of, their, tactical, application, was, in, the, victory, over, tilly, s, traditionally, organised, army, at, breitenfeld, in, september, 1631, line, formations, were, often, harder, to, co, ordinate, as, demonstrated, by, the, victory, of, the, supposedly, obsolete, spanish, tercios, over, the, new, model, swedish, army, at, n, rdlingen, in, 1634, they, lacked, the, offensive, impact, of, columns, and, gustavus, therefore, compensated, by, requiring, his, cavalry, to, be, far, more, aggressive, often, employing, his, finnish, light, cavalry, or, hakkapeliitta, as, shock, troops, he, also, used, columns, on, occasion, including, the, failed, assault, at, alte, veste, in, september, 1632, the, line, versus, column, debate, continued, into, the, early, 19th, century, and, both, were, employed, during, the, napoleonic, wars, such, tactics, needed, professional, soldiers, who, could, retain, formation, reload, and, fire, disciplined, salvos, while, under, attack, as, well, as, the, use, of, standardised, weapons, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, saw, the, publication, of, numerous, instruction, manuals, showing, the, movements, required, thirty, two, for, pikemen, and, forty, two, for, musketeers, training, an, infantryman, to, operate, in, this, way, was, estimated, as, six, months, although, in, reality, many, went, into, battle, with, far, less, experience, it, also, placed, greater, responsibility, on, junior, officers, who, provided, the, vital, links, between, senior, commanders, and, the, tactical, unit, one, of, the, first, military, schools, designed, to, produce, such, men, was, set, up, at, siegen, in, 1616, and, others, soon, followed, on, the, other, hand, strategic, thinking, failed, to, develop, at, the, same, pace, historian, jeremy, black, claims, most, campaigns, were, inconclusive, and, almost, exclusively, concerned, with, control, of, territory, rather, than, focused, strategic, objectives, the, lack, of, connection, between, military, and, diplomatic, goals, helps, explain, why, the, war, lasted, so, long, and, why, peace, proved, so, elusive, there, were, a, number, of, reasons, for, this, when, the, war, ended, in, 1648, the, franco, swedish, alliance, still, had, over, 84, 000, men, under, arms, on, imperial, territory, their, opponents, around, 77, 000, while, relatively, small, in, contemporary, terms, such, numbers, were, unprecedented, at, the, time, with, the, possible, exception, of, spain, the, 17th, century, state, could, not, support, armies, of, this, size, forcing, them, to, depend, on, contributions, levied, or, extorted, from, areas, they, passed, through, obtaining, supplies, thus, became, the, limiting, factor, in, campaign, planning, an, issue, that, grew, more, acute, later, in, the, war, when, much, of, the, empire, had, already, been, fought, over, even, when, adequate, provisions, could, be, gathered, the, next, problem, was, getting, them, to, the, troops, to, ensure, security, of, supply, commanders, were, forced, to, stay, close, to, rivers, then, the, primary, means, of, bulk, transportation, and, could, not, move, too, far, from, their, main, bases, many, historians, argue, feeding, the, troops, became, an, objective, in, itself, unconnected, to, diplomatic, goals, and, largely, uncontrolled, by, their, central, governments, the, result, was, armies, increasingly, devoid, of, intelligible, political, objectives, degenerating, into, travelling, armed, mobs, living, in, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, the, countryside, they, passed, through, this, often, conflicted, with, the, political, aims, of, their, employers, the, devastation, inflicted, in, 1628, and, 1629, by, imperial, troops, on, brandenburg, and, saxony, both, nominally, their, allies, was, a, major, factor, in, their, subsequent, support, for, swedish, intervention, it, has, been, suggested, the, breakdown, of, social, order, caused, by, the, war, was, often, more, significant, and, longer, lasting, than, the, immediate, damage, the, collapse, of, local, government, created, landless, peasants, who, banded, together, to, protect, themselves, from, the, soldiers, of, both, sides, and, led, to, widespread, rebellions, in, upper, austria, bavaria, and, brandenburg, soldiers, devastated, one, area, before, moving, on, leaving, large, tracts, of, land, empty, of, people, and, changing, the, ecosystem, food, shortages, were, worsened, by, an, explosion, in, the, rodent, population, while, bavaria, was, overrun, by, wolves, in, the, winter, of, 1638, and, its, crops, destroyed, by, packs, of, wild, pigs, the, following, spring, contemporaries, spoke, of, a, frenzy, of, despair, as, people, sought, to, make, sense, of, the, relentless, and, often, random, bloodshed, unleashed, by, the, war, attributed, by, religious, authorities, to, divine, retribution, for, sin, attempts, to, identify, a, supernatural, cause, led, to, a, series, of, witch, hunts, beginning, in, franconia, in, 1626, and, quickly, spreading, to, other, parts, of, germany, they, began, in, the, bishopric, of, w, rzburg, an, area, with, a, history, of, such, events, going, back, to, 1616, and, now, re, ignited, by, bishop, von, ehrenberg, a, devout, catholic, eager, to, assert, the, church, s, authority, in, his, territories, by, the, time, he, died, in, 1631, over, 900, people, from, all, levels, of, society, had, been, executed, the, bamberg, witch, trials, held, in, the, nearby, bishopric, of, bamberg, from, 1626, to, 1631, claimed, over, one, thousand, lives, in, 1629, 274, died, in, the, eichst, tt, witch, trials, plus, another, 50, in, the, adjacent, duchy, of, palatinate, neuburg, elsewhere, persecution, followed, imperial, military, success, expanding, into, baden, and, the, palatinate, following, their, reconquest, by, tilly, then, into, the, rhineland, however, the, extent, to, which, they, were, symptomatic, of, the, impact, of, the, conflict, on, society, is, debatable, since, many, took, place, in, areas, relatively, untouched, by, the, war, concerned, their, brutality, would, discredit, the, counter, reformation, ferdinand, ensured, active, persecution, largely, ended, by, 1630, although, the, war, caused, immense, destruction, it, has, also, been, credited, with, sparking, a, revival, in, german, literature, including, the, creation, of, societies, dedicated, to, purging, of, foreign, elements, from, the, german, language, one, example, is, simplicius, simplicissimus, often, suggested, as, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, the, picaresque, novel, written, by, hans, jakob, christoffel, von, grimmelshausen, in, 1668, it, includes, a, realistic, portrayal, of, a, soldier, s, life, based, on, his, own, experiences, many, of, which, are, verified, by, other, sources, other, less, famous, examples, include, the, diaries, of, peter, hagendorf, a, participant, in, the, sack, of, magdeburg, whose, descriptions, of, the, everyday, brutalities, of, the, war, remain, compelling, for, german, and, to, a, lesser, extent, czech, writers, the, war, was, remembered, as, a, defining, moment, of, national, trauma, the, 18th, century, poet, and, playwright, friedrich, schiller, being, one, of, many, to, use, it, in, their, work, variously, known, as, the, great, german, war, great, war, or, great, schism, for, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, german, nationalists, it, showed, the, dangers, of, a, divided, germany, and, was, used, to, justify, the, creation, of, the, german, empire, in, 1871, as, well, as, the, greater, germanic, reich, envisaged, by, the, nazis, bertolt, brecht, used, it, as, the, backdrop, for, his, 1939, anti, war, play, mother, courage, and, her, children, while, its, enduring, cultural, resonance, is, illustrated, by, the, novel, tyll, written, by, austro, german, author, daniel, kehlmann, and, also, set, during, the, war, it, was, nominated, for, the, 2020, booker, prize, the,

brandenburg, prussia, saxony, and, others, increasingly, pursued, their, own, policies, while, sweden, gained, a, permanent, foothold, in, the, empire, despite, these, setbacks, the, habsburg, lands, suffered, less, from, the, war, than, many, others, and, became, a, far, more, coherent, bloc, with, the, absorption, of, bohemia, and, restoration, of, catholicism, throughout, their, territories, by, laying, the, foundations, of, the, modern, nation, state, westphalia, changed, the, relationship, between, subjects, and, their, rulers, previously, many, had, overlapping, sometimes, conflicting, political, and, religious, allegiances, they, were, now, understood, to, be, subject, first, and, foremost, to, the, laws, and, edicts, of, their, respective, state, authority, not, the, claims, of, any, other, entity, religious, or, secular, this, made, it, easier, to, levy, national, forces, of, significant, size, loyal, to, their, state, and, its, leader, one, lesson, learned, from, wallenstein, and, the, swedish, invasion, was, the, need, for, their, own, permanent, armies, and, germany, as, a, whole, became, a, far, more, militarised, society, for, sweden, the, benefits, ultimately, proved, short, lived, unlike, french, gains, which, were, incorporated, into, france, swedish, territories, remained, part, of, the, empire, and, they, became, members, of, the, lower, and, upper, saxon, kreis, while, this, provided, both, seats, and, influence, in, the, imperial, diet, it, also, brought, sweden, into, direct, conflict, with, brandenburg, prussia, and, saxony, their, competitors, in, pomerania, the, income, from, their, german, possessions, was, relatively, minor, and, although, parts, of, pomerania, remained, swedish, until, 1815, much, of, it, was, ceded, to, prussia, in, 1679, and, 1720, france, arguably, gained, more, from, the, conflict, than, any, other, power, and, by, 1648, most, of, richelieu, s, objectives, had, been, achieved, these, included, separation, of, the, spanish, and, austrian, habsburgs, expansion, of, the, french, frontier, into, the, empire, and, an, end, to, spanish, military, supremacy, in, northern, europe, although, the, franco, spanish, war, continued, until, 1659, westphalia, allowed, louis, xiv, to, begin, replacing, spain, as, the, predominant, european, power, while, religion, remained, a, divisive, political, issue, in, many, countries, the, thirty, years, war, is, arguably, the, last, major, european, conflict, where, it, was, a, primary, driver, future, conflicts, were, either, internal, such, as, the, camisards, revolt, in, south, western, france, or, relatively, minor, like, the, 1712, toggenburg, war, the, war, created, the, outlines, of, a, europe, that, persisted, until, 1815, and, beyond, most, significantly, the, nation, state, of, france, along, with, the, start, of, a, split, between, germany, and, a, separate, austro, hungarian, bloc, or, critical
