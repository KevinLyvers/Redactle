the, second, italo, ethiopian, war, also, referred, to, as, the, second, italo, abyssinian, war, was, a, war, of, aggression, waged, by, italy, against, ethiopia, which, lasted, from, october, 1935, to, february, 1937, in, ethiopia, it, is, often, referred, to, simply, as, the, italian, invasion, amharic, romanized, alyan, war, ra, and, in, italy, as, the, ethiopian, war, italian, guerra, d, etiopia, it, is, seen, as, an, example, of, the, expansionist, policy, that, characterized, the, axis, powers, and, the, ineffectiveness, of, the, league, of, nations, before, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, on, 3, october, 1935, two, hundred, thousand, soldiers, of, the, italian, army, commanded, by, marshal, emilio, de, bono, attacked, from, eritrea, then, an, italian, colonial, possession, without, prior, declaration, of, war, at, the, same, time, a, minor, force, under, general, rodolfo, graziani, attacked, from, italian, somalia, on, 6, october, adwa, was, conquered, a, symbolic, place, for, the, italian, army, because, of, the, defeat, at, the, battle, of, adwa, by, the, ethiopian, army, during, the, first, italo, ethiopian, war, on, 15, october, italian, troops, seized, aksum, and, an, obelisk, adorning, the, city, was, torn, from, its, site, and, sent, to, rome, to, be, placed, symbolically, in, front, of, the, building, of, the, ministry, of, colonies,

arrived, invading, army, and, launched, a, counterattack, in, december, 1935, but, their, poorly, armed, forces, could, not, resist, for, long, against, the, modern, weapons, of, the, italians, even, the, communications, service, of, the, ethiopian, forces, depended, on, foot, messengers, as, they, did, not, have, radio, it, was, enough, for, the, italians, to, impose, a, narrow, fence, on, ethiopian, detachments, to, leave, them, unaware, of, the, movements, of, their, own, army, nazi, germany, sent, arms, and, munitions, to, ethiopia, because, it, was, frustrated, over, italian, objections, to, its, attempts, to, integrate, austria, this, prolonged, the, war, and, sapped, italian, resources, it, would, soon, lead, to, italy, s, greater, economic, dependence, on, germany, and, less, interventionist, policy, on, austria, clearing, the, path, for, adolf, hitler, s, anschluss, the, ethiopian, counteroffensive, managed, to, stop, the, italian, advance, for, a, few, weeks, but, the, superiority, of, the, italians, weapons, particularly, heavy, artillery, and, airstrikes, with, bombs, and, chemical, weapons, prevented, the, ethiopians, from, taking, advantage, of, their, initial, successes, the, italians, resumed, the, offensive, in, early, march, on, 29, march, 1936, graziani, bombed, the, city, of, harar, and, two, days, later, the, italians, won, a, decisive, victory, in, the, battle, of, maychew, which, nullified, any, possible, organized, resistance, of, the, ethiopians, emperor, haile, selassie, was, forced, to, escape, into, exile, on, 2, may, and, badoglio, s, forces, arrived, in, the, capital, addis, ababa, on, 5, may, italy, announced, the, annexation, of, the, territory, of, ethiopia, on, 7, may, and, italian, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, was, proclaimed, emperor, on, 9, may, the, provinces, of, eritrea, italian, somaliland, and, abyssinia, ethiopia, were, united, to, form, the, italian, province, of, east, africa, fighting, between, italian, and, ethiopian, troops, persisted, until, 19, february, 1937, on, the, same, day, an, attempted, assassination, of, graziani, led, to, the, reprisal, yekatit, 12, massacre, in, addis, ababa, in, which, between, 1, 400, and, 30, 000, civilians, were, killed, italian, forces, continued, to, suppress, rebel, activity, until, 1939, italian, troops, used, mustard, gas, in, aerial, bombardments, in, violation, of, the, geneva, protocol, and, geneva, conventions, against, combatants, and, civilians, in, an, attempt, to, discourage, the, ethiopian, people, from, supporting, the, resistance, deliberate, italian, attacks, against, ambulances, and, hospitals, of, the, red, cross, were, reported, by, all, estimates, hundreds, of, thousands, of, ethiopian, civilians, died, as, a, result, of, the, italian, invasion, which, have, been, described, by, some, historians, as, constituting, genocide, crimes, by, ethiopian, troops, included, the, use, of, dumdum, bullets, in, violation, of, the, hague, conventions, the, killing, of, civilian, workmen, including, during, the, gondrand, massacre, and, the, mutilation, of, captured, eritrean, ascari, and, italians, often, with, castration, beginning, in, the, first, weeks, of, war, the, kingdom, of, italy, began, its, attempts, to, establish, colonies, in, the, horn, of, africa, in, the, 1880s, the, first, phase, of, the, colonial, expansion, concluded, with, the, disastrous, first, italo, ethiopian, war, and, the, defeat, of, the, italian, forces, in, the, battle, of, adwa, on, 1, march, 1896, inflicted, by, the, ethiopian, army, of, negus, menelik, ii, in, the, following, years, italy, abandoned, its, expansionist, plans, in, the, area, and, limited, itself, to, administering, the, small, possessions, that, it, retained, in, the, area, the, colony, of, italian, eritrea, and, the, protectorate, later, colony, of, italian, somaliland, for, the, next, few, decades, italian, ethiopian, economic, and, diplomatic, relations, remained, relatively, stable, on, 14, december, 1925, italy, s, fascist, government, signed, a, secret, pact, with, britain, aimed, at, reinforcing, italian, dominance, in, the, region, london, recognised, that, the, area, was, of, italian, interest, and, agreed, to, the, italian, request, to, build, a, railway, connecting, somalia, and, eritrea, although, the, signatories, had, wished, to, maintain, the, secrecy, of, the, agreement, the, plan, soon, leaked, and, caused, indignation, by, the, french, and, ethiopian, governments, the, latter, denounced, it, as, a, betrayal, of, a, country, that, had, been, for, all, intents, and, purposes, a, member, of, the, league, of, nations, as, fascist, rule, in, italy, continued, to, radicalise, its, colonial, governors, in, the, horn, of, africa, began, pushing, outward, the, margins, of, their, imperial, foothold, the, governor, of, italian, eritrea, jacopo, gasparini, focused, on, the, exploitation, of, teseney, and, an, attempt, to, win, over, the, leaders, of, the, tigre, people, against, ethiopia, the, governor, of, italian, somaliland, cesare, maria, de, vecchi, began, a, policy, of, repression, that, led, to, the, occupation, of, the, fertile, jubaland, and, the, cessation, in, 1928, of, collaboration, between, the, settlers, and, the, traditional, somali, chiefs, the, italo, ethiopian, treaty, of, 1928, stated, that, the, border, between, italian, somaliland, and, ethiopia, was, 21, leagues, parallel, to, the, benadir, coast, approximately, 118, 3, kilometres, in, 1930, italy, built, a, fort, at, the, welwel, oasis, also, walwal, italian, ual, ual, in, the, ogaden, and, garrisoned, it, with, somali, dubats, irregular, frontier, troops, commanded, by, italian, officers, the, fort, at, welwel, was, well, beyond, the, 21, league, limit, and, inside, ethiopian, territory, on, 23, november, 1934, an, anglo, ethiopian, boundary, commission, studying, grazing, grounds, to, find, a, definitive, border, between, british, somaliland, and, ethiopia, arrived, at, welwel, the, party, contained, ethiopian, and, british, technicians, and, an, escort, of, around, 600, ethiopian, soldiers, both, sides, knew, that, the, italians, had, installed, a, military, post, at, welwel, and, were, not, surprised, to, see, an, italian, flag, at, the, wells, the, ethiopian, government, had, notified, the, italian, authorities, in, italian, somaliland, that, the, commission, was, active, in, the, ogaden, and, requested, the, italians, to, co, operate, when, the, british, commissioner, lieutenant, colonel, esmond, clifford, asked, the, italians, for, permission, to, camp, nearby, the, italian, commander, captain, roberto, cimmaruta, rebuffed, the, request, fitorari, shiferra, the, commander, of, the, ethiopian, escort, took, no, notice, of, the, 150, italian, and, somali, troops, and, made, camp, to, avoid, being, caught, in, an, italian, ethiopian, incident, clifford, withdrew, the, british, contingent, to, ado, about, 20, mi, 32, km, to, the, north, east, and, italian, aircraft, began, to, fly, over, welwel, the, ethiopian, commissioners, retired, with, the, british, but, the, escort, remained, for, ten, days, both, sides, exchanged, menaces, sometimes, no, more, than, 2, m, apart, reinforcements, increased, the, ethiopian, contingent, to, about, 1, 500, men, and, the, italians, to, about, 500, and, on, 5, december, 1934, shots, were, fired, the, italians, were, supported, by, an, armoured, car, and, bomber, aircraft, the, bombs, missed, but, machine, gunfire, from, the, car, caused, about, 110, ethiopian, casualties, 30, to, 50, italians, and, somalis, were, killed, the, incident, led, to, the, abyssinia, crisis, at, the, league, of, nations, on, 4, september, 1935, the, league, of, nations, exonerated, both, parties, for, the, incident, britain, and, france, preferring, italy, as, an, ally, against, germany, did, not, take, strong, steps, to, discourage, an, italian, military, buildup, on, the, borders, of, italian, eritrea, and, italian, somaliland, because, of, the, german, question, mussolini, needed, to, deter, hitler, from, annexing, austria, while, much, of, the, italian, army, was, being, deployed, to, the, horn, of, africa, which, led, him, to, draw, closer, to, france, to, provide, the, necessary, deterrent, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, shared, the, traditional, italian, respect, for, british, sea, power, and, insisted, to, mussolini, that, italy, must, not, antagonise, britain, before, he, assented, to, the, war, in, that, regard, british, diplomacy, in, the, first, half, of, 1935, greatly, assisted, mussolini, s, efforts, to, win, victor, emmanuel, s, support, for, the, invasion, on, 7, january, 1935, a, franco, italian, agreement, was, made, that, gave, italy, essentially, a, free, hand, in, africa, in, return, for, italian, co, operation, in, europe, pierre, laval, told, mussolini, that, he, wanted, a, franco, italian, alliance, against, nazi, germany, and, that, italy, had, a, free, hand, in, ethiopia, in, april, italy, was, further, emboldened, by, participation, in, the, stresa, front, an, agreement, to, curb, further, german, violations, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, the, first, draft, of, the, communique, at, stresa, summit, spoke, of, upholding, stability, all, over, the, world, but, british, foreign, secretary, sir, john, simon, insisted, for, the, final, draft, to, declare, that, britain, france, and, italy, were, committed, to, upholding, stability, in, europe, which, mussolini, took, for, british, acceptance, of, an, invasion, of, ethiopia, in, june, non, interference, was, further, assured, by, a, political, rift, which, had, developed, between, the, united, kingdom, and, france, because, of, the, anglo, german, naval, agreement, as, 300, 000, italian, soldiers, were, transferred, to, eritrea, and, italian, somaliland, over, the, spring, and, the, summer, of, 1935, the, world, s, media, was, abuzz, with, speculation, that, italy, would, soon, be, invading, ethiopia, in, june, 1935, anthony, eden, arrived, in, rome, with, the, message, that, britain, opposed, an, invasion, and, had, a, compromise, plan, for, italy, to, be, given, a, corridor, in, ethiopia, to, link, the, two, italian, colonies, in, the, horn, of, africa, which, mussolini, rejected, outright, as, the, italians, had, broken, the, british, naval, codes, mussolini, knew, of, the, problems, in, the, british, mediterranean, fleet, which, led, him, to, believe, that, the, british, opposition, to, the, invasion, which, had, come, as, an, unwelcome, surprise, to, him, was, not, serious, and, that, britain, would, never, go, to, war, over, ethiopia, the, prospect, that, an, italian, invasion, of, ethiopia, would, cause, a, crisis, in, anglo, italian, relations, was, seen, as, an, opportunity, in, berlin, although, hitler, did, not, want, to, see, haile, selassie, win, germany, provided, some, weapons, to, ethiopia, out, of, fear, of, quick, victory, for, italy, the, german, perspective, was, that, if, italy, was, bogged, down, in, a, long, war, in, ethiopia, that, would, probably, lead, to, britain, pushing, the, league, of, nations, to, impose, sanctions, on, italy, which, the, french, would, almost, certainly, not, veto, out, of, fear, of, destroying, relations, with, britain, that, would, cause, a, crisis, in, anglo, italian, relations, and, allow, germany, to, offer, its, good, services, to, italy, in, that, way, hitler, hoped, to, win, mussolini, as, an, ally, and, to, destroy, the, stresa, front, a, final, possible, foreign, ally, of, ethiopia, was, japan, which, had, served, as, a, model, to, some, ethiopian, intellectuals, after, the, welwel, incident, several, right, wing, japanese, groups, including, the, great, asianism, association, and, the, black, dragon, society, attempted, to, raise, money, for, the, ethiopian, cause, the, japanese, ambassador, to, italy, dr, sugimura, yotaro, on, 16, july, assured, mussolini, that, japan, held, no, political, interests, in, ethiopia, and, would, stay, neutral, in, the, coming, war, his, comments, stirred, up, a, furor, inside, japan, where, there, had, been, popular, affinity, for, the, fellow, nonwhite, empire, in, africa, which, was, reciprocated, with, similar, anger, in, italy, towards, japan, combined, with, praise, for, mussolini, and, his, firm, stance, against, the, gialli, di, tokyo, tokyo, yellows, despite, popular, opinion, when, the, ethiopians, approached, japan, for, help, on, 2, august, they, were, refused, and, even, a, modest, request, for, the, japanese, government, for, an, official, statement, of, its, support, for, ethiopia, during, the, coming, conflict, was, denied, with, war, appearing, inevitable, the, ethiopian, emperor, haile, selassie, ordered, a, general, mobilisation, of, the, army, of, the, ethiopian, empire, all, men, and, boys, able, to, carry, a, spear, go, to, addis, ababa, every, married, man, will, bring, his, wife, to, cook, and, wash, for, him, every, unmarried, man, will, bring, any, unmarried, woman, he,

worn, by, most, ethiopian, fighters, and, proved, to, be, an, excellent, target, the, skills, of, the, rases, the, ethiopian, generals, armies, were, reported, to, rate, from, relatively, good, to,

and, support, for, the, league, of, nations, which, at, least, implied, that, britain, would, support, ethiopia, however, the, british, service, chiefs, led, by, the, first, sea, lord, admiral, sir, earle, chatfield, all, advised, against, going, to, war, with, italy, for, the, sake, of, ethiopia, which, carried, much, weight, with, the, cabinet, during, the, 1935, election, baldwin, and, the, rest, of, the, cabinet, had, repeatedly, promised, that, britain, was, committed, to, upholding, collective, security, in, the, belief, of, that, being, the, best, way, to, neutralise, the, labour, party, which, also, ran, on, a, platform, emphasising, collective, security, and, support, for, the, league, of, nations, to, square, the, circle, caused, by, its, election, promises, and, its, desire, to, avoid, offending, mussolini, too, much, the, cabinet, decided, upon, a, plan, to, give, most, of, ethiopia, to, italy, with, the, rest, in, the, italian, sphere, of, influence, as, the, best, way, of, ending, the, war, in, early, december, 1935, the, hoare, laval, pact, was, proposed, by, britain, and, france, italy, would, gain, the, best, parts, of, ogaden, and, tigray, and, economic, influence, over, all, the, south, abyssinia, would, have, a, guaranteed, corridor, to, the, sea, at, the, port, of, assab, the, corridor, was, a, poor, one, and, known, as, a, corridor, for, camels, mussolini, was, ready, to, play, along, with, considering, the, hoare, laval, pact, rather, than, rejecting, it, outright, to, avoid, a, complete, break, with, britain, and, france, but, he, kept, demanding, changes, to, the, plan, before, he, would, accept, it, as, a, way, to, stall, for, more, time, to, allow, his, army, to, conquer, ethiopia, mussolini, was, not, prepared, to, abandon, the, goal, of, conquering, ethiopia, but, the, imposition, of, league, of, nations, sanctions, on, italy, caused, much, alarm, in, rome, the, war, was, wildly, popular, with, the, italian, people, who, relished, mussolini, s, defiance, of, the, league, as, an, example, of, italian, greatness, even, if, mussolini, had, been, willing, to, stop, the, war, the, move, would, have, been, very, unpopular, in, italy, kallis, wrote, especially, after, the, imposition, of, sanctions, in, november, 1935, the, popularity, of, the, fascist, regime, reached, unprecedented, heights, on, 13,

already, there, and, criniti, s, force, was, encircled, in, the, first, ethiopian, attack, two, italian, officers, were, killed, and, criniti, was, wounded, the, italians, tried, to, break, out,

italians, taken, prisoner, ethiopian, casualties, were, estimated, by, the, italians, to, be, 500, which, was, probably, greatly, exaggerated, the, news, from, the, northern, front, was, generally, bad, for, italy, however, foreign, correspondents, in, addis, ababa, publicly, took, up, knitting, to, mock, their, lack, of, access, to, the, front, there, was, no, way, for, them, to, verify, reports, that, 4, 700, italians, had, been, captured, the, correspondents, were, told, by, the, ethiopians, that, italian, tanks, had, been, stranded, and, abandoned, and, that, italian, native, troops, were, mutinying, later, a, report, was, issued, that, ethiopian, warriors, had, captured, eighteen, tanks, thirty, three, field, guns, 175, machine, guns, and, 2, 605, rifles, in, addition,

and, machine, guns, as, well, as, aerial, bombardment, with, chemical, weapons, at, first, with, mustard, gas, prevented, the, ethiopians, from, taking, advantage, of, their, initial, successes, the, ethiopians, in, general, were, very, poorly, armed, with, few, machine, guns, their, troops, mainly, armed, with, swords, and, spears, having, spent, a, decade, accumulating, poison, gas, in, east, africa, mussolini, gave, badoglio, authority, to, resort, to, schrecklichkeit, frightfulness, which, included, destroying, villages, and, using, gas, oc, 23, 06, 28, december, 1935, mussolini, was, even, prepared, to, resort, to, bacteriological, warfare, as, long, as, these, methods, could, be, kept, quiet, some, italians, objected, when, they, found, out, but, the, practices, were, kept, secret, the, government, issuing, denials, or, spurious, stories, blaming, the, ethiopians, as, the, progress, of, the, christmas, offensive, slowed, italian, plans, to, renew, the, advance, on, the,

eritrea, during, early, 1936, on, 20, january, the, italians, resumed, their, northern, offensive, at, the, first, battle, of, tembien, 20, to, 24, january, in, the, broken, terrain, between, the, warieu, pass, and, makale, the, forces, of, ras, kassa, were, defeated, the, italians, using, phosgene, gas, and, suffering, 1, 082, casualties, against, 8, 000, ethiopian, casualties, according, to, an, ethiopian, wireless, message, intercepted, by, the, italians, was, at, the, time, when, the, operations, for, the, encircling, of, makale, were, taking, place, that, the, italian, command,

vast, areas, of, territory, a, fine, death, dealing, rain, groups, of, nine, fifteen, eighteen, aircraft, followed, one, another, so, that, the, fog, issuing, from, them, formed, a, continuous, sheet, it, was, thus, that, as, from, the, end, of, january, 1936, soldiers, women, children, cattle, rivers, lakes, and, pastures, were, drenched, continually, with, this, deadly, rain, to, systematically, kill, all, living, creatures, to, more, surely, poison, waters, and, pastures, the, italian, command, made, its, aircraft, pass, over, and, over, again, that, was, its, chief, method, of, warfare, from, 10, to, 19, february, the, italians, captured, amba, aradam, and, destroyed, ras, mulugeta, s, army, in, the, battle, of, amba, aradam, battle, of, enderta, the, ethiopians, suffered, massive,

1936, to, 10, june, 1940, are, 8, 284, men, killed, which, sbacchi, considered, to, be, fairly, accurate, there, was, a, lack, of, reliable, statistics, because, confusion, during, the, invasion,

are, unreliable, and, were, likely, exaggerated, to, extract, more, reparations, he, asserts, that, the, italian, estimation, is, more, accurate, italian, military, forces, used, between, 300, and, 500, tons, of, mustard, gas, to, attack, both, military, and, civilian, targets, despite, being, a, signatory, to, the, 1925, geneva, protocol, banning, the, practice, this, gas, had, been, produced, during, world, war, i, and, subsequently, transported, to, east, africa, j, f, c, fuller, who, was, present, in, ethiopia, during, the, conflict, stated, that, mustard, gas, was, the, decisive, tactical, factor, in, the, war, historian, walter, laqueur, estimates, that, up, to, one, third, of, ethiopian, casualties, of, the, war, were, caused, by, chemical, weapons, the, italians, claimed, that, their, use, of, gas, was, justified, by, the, execution, of, tito, minniti, and, his, observer, in, ogaden, by, ethiopian, forces, however, the, use, of, gas, was, authorized, by, mussolini, nearly, two, months, before, minniti, s, death, on, 26, december, 1935, as, evinced, by, the, following, order, rome, october, 27, 1935, to, his, excellency, graziani, the, use, of, gas, as, an, ultima, ratio, to, overwhelm, enemy, resistance, and, in, case, of, counter, attack, is, authorized, mussolini, after, minniti, s, death, the, order, was, expanded, to, use, of, gas, on, a, vast, scale, rome, december, 28, 1935, to, his, excellency, badoglio, given, the, enemy, system, i, have, authorized, your, excellency, the, use, even, on, a, vast, scale, of, any, gas, and, flamethrowers, mussolini, military, and, civilian, targets, were, gas, bombed, and, on, 30, december, a, red, cross, unit, was, bombed, at, dolo, and, an, egyptian, ambulance, was, attacked, at, bulale, a, few, days, later, an, egyptian, medical, unit, was, bombed, at, daggah, bur, there, were, more, attacks, in, january, and, february, then, on, 4, march, 1936, a, british, red, cross, camp, near, quoram, appeared, to, be, subject, to, the, most, deliberate, attack, of, all, when, low, flying, italian, aircraft, crews, could, not, have, missed, the, big, red, cross, signs, mustard, gas, was, also, sprayed, from, above, on, ethiopian, combatants, and, villages, the, italians, tried, to, keep, their, resort, to, chemical, warfare, secret, but, were, exposed, by, the, international, red, cross, and, many, foreign, observers, the, italians, claimed, that, at, least, 19, bombardments, of, red, cross, tents, posted, in, the, areas, of, military, encampment, of, the, ethiopian, resistance, had, been, erroneous, the, italians, delivered, poison, gas, by, gas, shell, and, in, bombs, dropped, by, the, regia, aeronautica, though, poorly, equipped, the, ethiopians, had, achieved, some, success, against, modern, weaponry, but, had, no, defence, against, the, terrible, rain, that, burned, and, killed, in, general, historians, concluded, that, the, use, of, chemical, weapons, was, effective, and, devastating, to, morale, and, manpower, though, some, disagree, and, argue, that, they, had, negligible, effect, in, battle, historian, angelo, del, boca, condemned, the, use, of, gas, but, argued, that, it, had, only, a, minimal, effect, on, italian, war, aims, an, analysis, by, the, stockholm, international, peace, research, institute, argued, that, the, use, of, chemical, weapons, shifted, the, war, in, favor, of, the, italians, and, dealt, a, major, blow, to, ethiopian, morale, american, and, british, military, analysis, came, to, similar, conclusions, the, us, military, concluded, that, chemical, weapons, were, devastating, against, the, unprepared, and, unprotected, ethiopians, british, major, general, j, f, c, fuller, assigned, to, the, italian, army, noted, that, in, place, of, the, laborious, process, of, picketing, the, heights, the, heights, sprayed, with, gas, were, rendered, unoccupiable, by, the, enemy, save, at, the, gravest, risk, it, was, an, exceedingly, cunning, use, of, this, chemical, haile, selassie, in, his, report, to, the, league, of, nations, described, it, special, sprayers, were, installed, on, board, aircraft, so, they, could, vaporize, over, vast, areas, of, territory, a, fine, death, dealing, rain, groups, of, 9, 15, or, 18, aircraft, followed, one, another, so, that, the, fog, issuing, from, them, formed, a, continuous, sheet, it, was, thus, that, as, from, the, end, of, january, 1936, soldiers, women, children, cattle, rivers, lakes, and, pastures, were, drenched, continually, with, this, deadly, rain, in, order, more, surely, to, poison, the, waters, and, pastures, the, italian, command, made, its, aircraft, pass, over, and, over, again, these, fearful, tactics, succeeded, men, and, animals, succumbed, the, deadly, rain, that, fell, from, the, aircraft, made, all, those, whom, it, touched, fly, shrieking, with, pain, all, those, who, drank, poisoned, water, or, ate, infected, food, also, succumbed, in, dreadful, suffering, in, tens, of, thousands, the, victims, of, italian, mustard, gas, fell, ethiopian, troops, used, dum, dum, bullets, which, had, been, banned, by, declaration, iv, 3, of, the, hague, convention, 1899, and, began, mutilating, captured, eritrean, askari, often, with, castration, beginning, in, the, first, weeks, of, war, some, hundreds, of, colonial, eritrean, ascari, and, dozens, of, italians, suffered, these, amputations, often, done, before, death, as, allegedly, happened, to, 17, italian, workers, emasculated, in, gondrand, in, february, 1936, italy, s, military, victory, overshadowed, concerns, about, the, economy, mussolini, was, at, the, height, of, his, popularity, in, may, 1936, with, the, proclamation, of, the, italian, empire, his, biographer, renzo, de, felice, called, the, war, mussolini, s, masterpiece, as, for, a, brief, moment, he, had, been, able, to, create, something, resembling, a, national, consensus, both, in, favor, of, himself, and, his, regime, when, badoglio, returned, to, italy, he, received, a, snub, as, mussolini, made, certain, that, the, honours, bestowed, on, badoglio, received, fell, short, of, those, granted, to, an, italian, national, hero, in, order, to, present, the, victory, as, an, achievement, of, the, fascist, system, rather, than, as, an, achievement, of, the, traditional, italian, elites, of, which, badoglio, was, a, member, a, sign, of, mussolini, s, increased, power, and, popularity, after, the, war, was, his, creation, of, a, new, military, rank, first, marshal, of, the, italian, empire, to, which, he, promoted, both, himself, and, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, thus, putting, the, prime, minister, on, a, theoretical, level, of, equality, with, the, king, haile, selassie, sailed, from,
