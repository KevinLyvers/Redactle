great, catherine, s, son, paul, i, who, succeeded, his, mother, in, 1796, was, particularly, proud, to, be, a, great, grandson, of, peter, the, great, although, his, mother, s, memoirs, arguably, insinuate, that, paul, s, natural, father, was, in, fact, her, lover, sergei, saltykov, rather, than, her, husband, peter, painfully, aware, of, the, hazards, resulting, from, battles, of, succession, paul, decreed, house, laws, for, the, romanovs, the, so, called, pauline, laws, among, the, strictest, in, europe, which, established, semi, salic, primogeniture, as, the, rule, of, succession, to, the, throne, requiring, orthodox, faith, for, the, monarch, and, dynasts, and, for, the, consorts, of, the, monarchs, and, their, near, heirs, later, alexander, i, responding, to, the, 1820,

sovereign, dynasty, paul, i, was, murdered, in, his, palace, in, saint, petersburg, in, 1801, alexander, i, succeeded, him, on, the, throne, and, later, died, without, leaving, a, son, his, brother, crowned, nicholas, i, succeeded, him, on, the, throne, in, 1825, the, succession, was, far, from, smooth, however, as, hundreds, of, troops, took, the, oath, of, allegiance, to, nicholas, s, elder, brother, constantine, pavlovich, who, unbeknownst, to, them, had, renounced, his, claim, to, the, throne, in, 1822, following, his, marriage, the, confusion, combined, with, opposition, to, nicholas, accession, led, to, the, decembrist, revolt, nicholas, i, fathered, four, sons, educating, them, for, the, prospect, of, ruling, russia, and, for, military, careers, from, whom, the, last, branches, of, the, dynasty, descended, alexander, ii, son, of, nicholas, i, became, the, next, russian, emperor, in, 1855, in, the, midst, of, the, crimean, war, while, alexander, considered, it, his, charge, to, maintain, peace, in, europe, and, russia, he, believed, only, a, strong, russian, military, could, keep, the, peace, by, developing, the, imperial, russian, army, giving, increased, autonomy, to, finland, and, freeing, the, serfs, in, 1861, he, gained, much, popular, support, for, his, reign, despite, his, popularity, however, his, family, life, began, to, unravel, by, the, mid, 1860s, in, 1864, his, eldest, son, and, heir, tsarevich, nicholas, died, suddenly, his, wife, empress, maria, alexandrovna, who, suffered, from, tuberculosis, spent, much, of, her, time, abroad, alexander, eventually, turned, to, a, mistress, princess, catherine, dolgorukova, immediately, following, the, death, of, his, wife, in, 1880, he, contracted, a, morganatic, marriage, with, dolgorukova, his, legitimization, of, their, children, and, rumors, that, he, was, contemplating, crowning, his, new, wife, as, empress, caused, tension, within, the, dynasty, in, particular, the, grand, duchesses, were, scandalized, at, the, prospect, of, deferring, to, a, woman, who, had, borne, alexander, several, children, during, his, wife, s, lifetime, before, princess, catherine, could, be, elevated, in, rank, however, on, 13, march, 1881, alexander, was, assassinated, by, a, hand, made, bomb, hurled, by, ignacy, hryniewiecki, slavic, patriotism, cultural, revival, and, panslavist, ideas, grew, in,

for, conservative, reforms, in, russia, not, expected, to, inherit, the, throne, he, was, educated, in, matters, of, state, only, after, the, death, of, his, older, brother, nicholas, lack, of, diplomatic, training, may, have, influenced, his, politics, as, well, as, those, of, his, son, nicholas, ii, alexander, iii, was, physically, impressive, being, not, only, tall, 1, 93, m, or, 6, 4, according, to, some, sources, but, of, large, physique, and, considerable, strength, his, beard, hearkened, back, to, the, likeness, of, tsars, of, old, contributing, to, an, aura, of, brusque, authority, awe, inspiring, to, some, alienating, to, others, alexander, fearful, of, the, fate, which, had, befallen, his, father, strengthened, autocratic, rule, in, russia, some, of, the, reforms, the, more, liberal, alexander, ii, had, pushed, through, were, reversed, alexander, had, inherited, not, only, his, dead, brother, s, position, as, tsesarevich, but, also, his, brother, s, danish,

nicholas, and, mother, to, their, five, children, yet, avoided, many, of, the, social, duties, traditional, for, russia, s, tsarinas, seen, as, distant, and, severe, unfavorable, comparisons, were, drawn, between, her, and, her, popular, mother, in, law, maria, fyodorovna, when, in, september, 1915, nicholas, took, command, of, the, army, at, the, front, lines, during, world, war, i, alexandra, sought, to, influence, him, toward, an, authoritarian, approach, in, government, affairs, even, more, than, she, had, done, during, peacetime, his, well, known, devotion, to, her, injured, both, his, and, the, dynasty, s, reputation, during, world, war, i, due, to, both, her, german, origin, and, her, unique, relationship, with, rasputin, whose, role, in, the, life, of, her, only, son, was, not,
