the, capital, of, which, was, merv, in, today, s, turkmenistan, the, early, greek, historian, ctesias, c, 400, bc, followed, by, diodorus, siculus, alleged, that, the, legendary, assyrian, king, ninus, had, defeated, a, bactrian, king, named, oxyartes, in, c, 2140, bc, or, some, 1000, years, before, the, trojan, war, since, the, decipherment, of, cuneiform, script, in, the, 19th, century, however, which, enabled, actual, assyrian, records, to, be, read, historians, have, ascribed, little, value, to, the, greek, account, according, to, some, writers, bactria, was, the, homeland, airyanem, vaejah, of, indo, iranians, who, moved, south, west, into, iran, and, the, north, west, of, the, south, asian, subcontinent, around, 2500, 2000, bc, later, it, became, the, northern, province, of, the, achaemenid, empire, in, central, asia, it, was, in, these, regions, where, the, fertile, soil, of, the, mountainous, country, is, surrounded, by, the, turan, depression, that, the, prophet, zoroaster, was, said, to, have, been, born, and, gained, his, first, adherents, avestan, the, language, of, the, oldest, portions, of, the, zoroastrian, avesta, was, one, of, the, old, iranian, languages, and, is, the, oldest, attested, member, of, the, eastern, iranian, languages, ernst, herzfeld, suggested, that, bactria, belonged, to, the, medes, before, its, annexation, to, the, achaemenid, empire, by, cyrus, the, great, in, sixth, century, bc, after, which, it, and, margiana, formed, the, twelfth, satrapy, of, persia, after, darius, iii, had, been, defeated, by, alexander, the, great, the, satrap, of, bactria, bessus, attempted, to, organize, a, national, resistance, but, was, captured, by, other, warlords, and, delivered, to, alexander, he, was, then, tortured, and, killed, under, persian, rule, many, greeks, were, deported, to, bactria, so, that, their, communities, and, language, became, common, in, the, area, during, the, reign, of, darius, i, the, inhabitants, of, the, greek, city, of, barca, in, cyrenaica, were, deported, to, bactria, for, refusing, to, surrender, assassins, in, addition, xerxes, also, settled, the, branchidae, in, bactria, they, were, the, descendants, of, greek, priests, who, had, once, lived, near, didyma, western, asia, minor, and, betrayed, the, temple, to, him, herodotus, also, records, a, persian, commander, threatening, to, enslave, daughters, of, the, revolting, ionians, and, send, them, to, bactria, persia, subsequently, conscripted, greek, men, from, these, settlements, in, bactria, into, their, military, as, did, alexander, later, alexander, conquered, sogdiana, in, the, south, beyond, the, oxus, he, met, strong, resistance, but, ultimately, conquered, the, region, through, both, military, force, and, diplomacy, marrying, roxana, daughter, of, the, defeated, satrap, of, bactria, oxyartes, he, founded, two, greek, cities, in, bactria, including, his, easternmost, alexandria, eschate, alexandria, the, furthest, after, alexander, s, death, diodorus, siculus, tells, us, that, philip, received, dominion, over, bactria, but, justin, names, amyntas, to, that, role, at, the, treaty, of, triparadisus, both, diodorus, siculus, and, arrian, agree, that, the, satrap, stasanor, gained, control, over, bactria, eventually, alexander, s, empire, was, divided, up, among, the, generals, in, alexander, s, army, bactria, became, a, part, of, the, seleucid, empire, named, after, its, founder, seleucus, i, the, macedonians, especially, seleucus, i, and, his, son, antiochus, i, established, the, seleucid, empire, and, founded, a, number, of, greek, towns, the, greek, language, became, dominant, for, some, time, there, the, paradox, that, greek, presence, was, more, prominent, in, bactria, than, in, areas, far, closer, to, greece, can, possibly, be, explained, by, past, deportations, of, greeks, to, bactria, when, alexander, s, troops, entered, bactria, they, discovered, communities, of, greeks, who, appeared, to, have, been, deported, to, the, region, by, the, persians, in, previous, centuries, considerable, difficulties, faced, by, the, seleucid, kings, and, the, attacks, of, pharaoh, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, gave, the, satrap, of, bactria, diodotus, i, the, opportunity, to, declare, independence, about, 245, bc, and, conquer, sogdia, he, was, the, founder, of, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, diodotus, and, his, successors, were, able, to, maintain, themselves, against, the, attacks, of, the, seleucids, particularly, from, antiochus, iii, the, great, who, was, ultimately, defeated, by, the, romans, 190, bc, the, greco, bactrians, were, so, powerful, that, they, were, able, to, expand, their, territory, as, far, as, south, asia, as, for, bactria, a, part, of, it, lies, alongside, aria, towards, the, north, though, most, of, it, lies, above, aria, and, to, the, east, of, it, and, much, of, it, produces, everything, except, oil, the, greeks, who, caused, bactria, to, revolt, grew, so, powerful, on, account, of, the, fertility, of, the, country, that, they, became, masters, not, only, of, bactria, and, beyond, but, also, of, india, as, apollodorus, of, artemita, says, and, more, tribes, were, subdued, by, them, than, by, alexander, the, last, greco, bactrian, king, heliocles, i, lost, control, of, bactria, to, nomadic, invaders, near, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, at, which, point, greek, political, power, ceased, in, bactria, but, greek, cultural, influence, continued, for, many, more, centuries, the, greco, bactrians, used, the, greek, language, for, administrative, purposes, and, the, local, bactrian, language, was, also, hellenized, as, suggested, by, its, adoption, of, the, greek, alphabet, and, greek, loanwords, the, bactrian, king, euthydemus, i, and, his, son, demetrius, i, crossed, the, hindu, kush, mountains, and, began, the, conquest, of, the, indus, valley, for, a, short, time, they, wielded, great, power, a, great, greek, empire, seemed, to, have, arisen, far, in, the, east, but, this, empire, was, torn, by, internal, dissension, and, continual, usurpations, when, demetrius, advanced, far, east, of, the, indus, river, one, of, his, generals, eucratides, made, himself, king, of, bactria, and, soon, in, every, province, there, arose, new, usurpers, who, proclaimed, themselves, kings, and, fought, against, each, other, for, example, eucratides, is, known, to, have, battled, another, king, named, demetrius, of, india, probably, demetrius, ii, the, latter, ultimately, being, defeated, according, to, the, historian, justin, most, of, them, we, know, only, by, their, coins, a, great, many, of, which, are, found, in, afghanistan, by, these, wars, the, dominant, position, of, the, greeks, was, undermined, even, more, quickly, than, would, otherwise, have, been, the, case, after, demetrius, and, eucratides, the, kings, abandoned, the, attic, standard, of, coinage, and, introduced, a, native, standard, no, doubt, to, gain, support, from, outside, the, greek, minority, in, the, indus, valley, this, went, even, further, the, indo, greek, king, menander, i, known, as, milinda, in, south, asia, recognized, as, a, great, conqueror, converted, to, buddhism, his, successors, managed, to, cling, to, power, until, the, last, known, indo, greek, ruler, a, king, named, strato, ii, who, ruled, in, the, punjab, region, until, around, 55, bc, other, sources, however, place, the, end, of, strato, ii, s, reign, as, late, as, 10, ad, daxia, ta, hsia, or, ta, hia, chinese, pinyin, d, xi, was, the, name, given, in, antiquity, by, the, han, chinese, to, tukhara, or, tokhara, the, central, part, of, bactria, the, name, daxia, appears, in, chinese, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, designate, a, little, known, kingdom, located, somewhere, west, of, china, this, was, possibly, a, consequence, of, the, first, contacts, between, china, and, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, during, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, greco, bactrians, were, conquered, by, nomadic, indo, european, tribes, from, the, north, beginning, with, the, sakas, 160, bc, the, sakas, were, overthrown, in, turn, by, the, da, yuezhi, greater, yuezhi, during, subsequent, decades, the, yuezhi, had, conquered, bactria, by, the, time, of, the, visit, of, the, chinese, envoy, zhang, qian, circa, 127, bc, who, had, been, sent, by, the, han, emperor, to, investigate, lands, to, the, west, of, china, the, first, mention, of, these, events, in, european, literature, appeared, in, the, 1st, century, bc, when, strabo, described, how, the, asii, pasiani, tokhari, and, sakarauli, had, taken, part, in, the, destruction, of, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, ptolemy, subsequently, mentioned, the, central, role, of, the, tokhari, among, other, tribes, in, bactria, as, tukhara, or, tokhara, it, included, areas, that, were, later, part, of, surxondaryo, region, in, uzbekistan, southern, tajikistan, and, northern, afghanistan, the, tokhari, spoke, a, language, known, later, as, bactrian, an, iranian, language, the, tokhari, and, their, language, should, not, be, confused, with, the, tocharian, people, who, lived, in, the, tarim, basin, between, the, 3rd, and, 9th, centuries, ad, or, the, tocharian, languages, that, form, another, branch, of, indo, european, languages, the, name, daxia, was, used, in, the, shiji, records, of, the, grand, historian, by, sima, qian, based, on, the, reports, of, zhang, qian, the, shiji, describe, daxia, as, an, important, urban, civilization, of, about, one, million, people, living, in, walled, cities, under, small, city, kings, or, magistrates, daxia, was, an, affluent, country, with, rich, markets, trading, in, an, incredible, variety, of, objects, coming, from, as, far, as, southern, china, by, the, time, zhang, qian, visited, there, was, no, longer, a, major, king, and, the, bactrians, were, under, the, suzerainty, of, the, yuezhi, zhang, qian, depicted, a, rather, sophisticated, but, demoralised, people, who, were, afraid, of, war, following, these, reports, the, chinese, emperor, wu, di, was, informed, of, the, level, of, sophistication, of, the, urban, civilizations, of, ferghana, bactria, and, parthia, and, became, interested, in, developing, commercial, relationship, with, them, the, son, of, heaven, on, hearing, all, this, reasoned, thus, dayuan, and, the, possessions, of, daxia, and, anxi, parthia, are, large, countries, full, of, rare, things, with, a, population, living, in, fixed, abodes, and, given, to, occupations, somewhat, identical, with, those, of, the, people, of, han, but, with, weak, armies, and, placing, great, value, on, the, rich, produce, of, china, these, contacts, immediately, led, to, the, dispatch, of, multiple, embassies, from, the, chinese, which, helped, to, develop, trade, along, the, silk, roads, kujula, kadphises, the, xihou, prince, of, the, yuezhi, united, the, region, in, the, early, 1st, century, and, laid, the, foundations, for, the, powerful, but, short, lived, kushan, empire, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, tukhara, was, under, the, rule, of, the, kushanshas, indo, sasanians, the, form, tokharistan, the, suffix, stan, means, place, of, in, persian, appeared, for, the, first, time, in, the, 4th, century, in, buddhist, texts, such, as, the, vibhasa, sastra, tokhara, was, known, in, chinese, sources, as, tuhuluo, which, is, first, mentioned, during, the, northern, wei, era, in, the, tang, dynasty, the, name, is, transcribed, as, tuhuoluo, other, chinese, names, are, doushaluo, douquluo, or, duhuoluo, during, the, 5th, century, ad, bactria, was, controlled, by, the, xionites, and, the, hephthalites, but, was, subsequently, reconquered, by, the, sassanid, empire, by, the, mid, 7th, century, ad, islam, under, the, rashidun, caliphate, had, come, to, rule, much, of, the, middle, east, and, western, areas, of, central, asia, in, 663, ad, the, umayyad, caliphate, attacked, the, buddhist, shahi, dynasty, ruling, in, tokharistan, the, umayyad, forces, captured, the, area, around, balkh, including, the, buddhist, monastery, at, nava, vihara, causing, the, shahis, to, retreat, to, the, kabul, valley, in, the, 8th, century, ad, a, persian, from, balkh, known, as, saman, khuda, left, zoroastrianism, for, islam, while, living, under, the, umayyads, his, children, founded, the, samanid, empire, 875, 999, ad, persian, became, the, official, language, and, had, a, higher, status, than, bactrian, because, it, was, the, language, of, muslim, rulers, it, eventually, replaced, the, latter, as, the, common, language, due, to, the, preferential, treatment, as, well, as, colonization, several, important, trade, routes, from, india, and, china, including, the, silk, road, passed, through, bactria, and, as, early, as, the, bronze, age, this, had, allowed, the, accumulation, of, vast, amounts, of, wealth, by, the, mostly, nomadic, population, the, first, proto, urban, civilization, in, the, area, arose, during, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, control, of, these, lucrative, trade, routes, however, attracted, foreign, interest, and, in, the, 6th, century, bc, the, bactrians, were, conquered, by, the, persians, and, in, the, 4th, century, bc, by, alexander, the, great, these, conquests, marked, the, end, of, bactrian, independence, from, around, 304, bc, the, area, formed, part, of, the, seleucid, empire, and, from, around, 250, bc, it, was, the, centre, of, a, greco, bactrian, kingdom, ruled, by, the, descendants, of, greeks, who, had, settled, there, following, the, conquest, of, alexander, the, great, the, greco, bactrians, also, known, in, sanskrit, as, yavanas, worked, in, cooperation, with, the, native, bactrian, aristocracy, by, the, early, 2nd, century, bc, the, greco, bactrians, had, created, an, impressive, empire, that, stretched, southwards, to, include, north, west, india, by, about, 135, bc, however, this, kingdom, had, been, overrun, by, invading, yuezhi, tribes, an, invasion, that, later, brought, about, the, rise, of, the, powerful, kushan, empire, bactrians, were, recorded, in, strabo, s, geography, now, in, early, times, the, sogdians, and, bactrians, did, not, differ, much, from, the, nomads, in, their, modes, of, life, and, customs, although, the, bactrians, were, a, little, more, civilised, however, of, these, as, of, the, others, onesicritus, does, not, report, their, best, traits, saying, for, instance, that, those, who, have, become, helpless, because, of, old, age, or, sickness, are, thrown, out, alive, as, prey, to, dogs, kept, expressly, for, this, purpose, which, in, their, native, tongue, are, called, undertakers, and, that, while, the, land, outside, the, walls, of, the, metropolis, of, the, bactrians, looks, clean, yet, most, of, the, land, inside, the, walls, is, full, of, human, bones, but, that, alexander, broke, up, the, custom, the, bactrians, spoke, bactrian, a, north, eastern, iranian, language, bactrian, became, extinct, replaced, by, north, eastern, iranian, languages, such, as, munji, yidgha, ishkashimi, and, pashto, the, encyclopaedia, iranica, states, bactrian, thus, occupies, an, intermediary, position, between, pashto, and, yidgha, munji, on, the, one, hand, sogdian, choresmian, and, parthian, on, the, other, it, is, thus, in, its, natural, and, rightful, place, in, bactria, the, principal, religions, of, the, area, before, the, islamic, invasion, were, zoroastrianism, and, buddhism, contemporary, tajiks, are, the, descendants, of, ancient, eastern, iranian, inhabitants, of, central, asia, in, particular, the, sogdians, and, the, bactrians, and, possibly, other, groups, with, an, admixture, of,
