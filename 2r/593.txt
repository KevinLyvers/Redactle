racial, segregation, that, existed, in, south, africa, and, south, west, africa, now, namibia, from, 1948, to, the, early, 1990s, apartheid, was, characterised, by, an, authoritarian, political, culture, based, on, baasskap, lit, boss, ship, or, boss, hood, which, ensured, that, south, africa, was, dominated, politically, socially, and, economically, by, the, nation, s, minority, white, population, in, this, minoritarian, system, there, was, social, stratification, and, campaigns, of, marginalization, such, that, white, citizens, had, the, highest, status, with, them, being, followed, by, indians, as, well, as, coloureds, and, then, black, africans, the, economic, legacy, and, social, effects, of, apartheid, continue, to, the, present, day, particularly, inequality, broadly, speaking, apartheid, was, delineated, into, petty, apartheid, which, entailed, the, segregation, of, public, facilities, and, social, events, and, grand, apartheid, which, strictly, separated, housing, and, employment, opportunities, by, race, the, first, apartheid, law, was, the, prohibition, of, mixed, marriages, act, 1949, followed, closely, by, the, immorality, amendment, act, of, 1950, which, made, it, illegal, for, most, south, african, citizens, to, marry, or, pursue, sexual, relationships, across, racial, lines, the, population, registration, act, 1950, classified, all, south, africans, into, one, of, four, racial, groups, based, on, appearance, known, ancestry, socioeconomic, status, and, cultural, lifestyle, black, white, coloured, and, indian, the, last, two, of, which, included, several, sub, classifications, places, of, residence, were, determined, by, racial, classification, between, 1960, and, 1983, 3, 5, million, black, africans, were, removed, from, their, homes, and, forced, into, segregated, neighbourhoods, as, a, result, of, apartheid, legislation, in, some, of, the, largest, mass, evictions, in, modern, history, most, of, these, targeted, removals, were, intended, to, restrict, the, black, population, to, ten, designated, tribal, homelands, also, known, as, bantustans, four, of, which, became, nominally, independent, states, the, government, announced, that, relocated, persons, would, lose, their, south, african, citizenship, as, they, were, absorbed, into, the, bantustans, apartheid, sparked, significant, international, and, domestic, opposition, resulting, in, some, of, the, most, influential, global, social, movements, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, the, target, of, frequent, condemnation, in, the, united, nations, and, brought, about, extensive, international, sanctions, including, arms, embargoes, and, economic, sanctions, on, south, africa, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, internal, resistance, to, apartheid, became, increasingly, militant, prompting, brutal, crackdowns, by, the, national, party, ruling, government, and, protracted, sectarian, violence, that, left, thousands, dead, or, in, detention, the, truth, and, reconciliation, commission, found, that, there, were, 21, 000, deaths, from, political, violence, with, 7, 000, deaths, between, 1948, and, 1989, and, 14, 000, deaths, and, 22, 000, injuries, in, the, transition, period, between, 1990, and, 1994, some, reforms, of, the, apartheid, system, were, undertaken, including, allowing, for, indian, and, coloured, political, representation, in, parliament, but, these, measures, failed, to, appease, most, activist, groups, between, 1987, and, 1993, the, national, party, entered, into, bilateral, negotiations, with, the, african, national, congress, anc, the, leading, anti, apartheid, political, movement, for, ending, segregation, and, introducing, majority, rule, in, 1990, prominent, anc, figures, such, as, nelson, mandela, were, released, from, prison, apartheid, legislation, was, repealed, on, 17, june, 1991, leading, to, multiracial, elections, in, april, 1994, apartheid, is, an, afrikaans, word, meaning, separateness, or, the, state, of, being, apart, literally, apart, hood, from, the, afrikaans, suffix, heid, its, first, recorded, use, was, in, 1929, racial, discrimination, and, inequality, against, black, people, in, south, africa, dates, to, the, beginning, of, large, scale, european, colonisation, of, south, africa, with, the, dutch, east, india, company, s, establishment, of, a, trading, post, in, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, 1652, which, eventually, expanded, into, the, dutch, cape, colony, the, company, began, the, khoikhoi, dutch, wars, in, which, it, displaced, the, local, khoikhoi, people, replaced, them, with, farms, worked, by, white, settlers, and, imported, black, slaves, from, across, the, dutch, empire, in, the, days, of, slavery, slaves, required, passes, to, travel, away, from, their, masters, in, 1797, the, landdrost, and, heemraden, local, officials, of, swellendam, and, graaff, reinet, extended, pass, laws, beyond, slaves, and, ordained, that, all, khoikhoi, designated, as, hottentots, moving, about, the, country, for, any, purpose, should, carry, passes, this, was, confirmed, by, the, british, colonial, government, in, 1809, by, the, hottentot, proclamation, which, decreed, that, if, a, khoikhoi, were, to, move, they, would, need, a, pass, from, their, master, or, a, local, official, ordinance, no, 49, of, 1828, decreed, that, prospective, black, immigrants, were, to, be, granted, passes, for, the, sole, purpose, of, seeking, work, these, passes, were, to, be, issued, for, coloureds, and, khoikhoi, but, not, for, other, africans, who, were, still, forced, to, carry, passes, during, the, french, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, the, british, empire, captured, and, annexed, the, dutch, cape, colony, under, the, 1806, cape, articles, of, capitulation, the, new, british, colonial, rulers, were, required, to, respect, previous, legislation, enacted, under, roman, dutch, law, and, this, led, to, a, separation, of, the, law, in, south, africa, from, english, common, law, and, a, high, degree, of, legislative, autonomy, the, governors, and, assemblies, that, governed, the, legal, process, in, the, various, colonies, of, south, africa, were, launched, on, a, different, and, independent, legislative, path, from, the, rest, of, the, british, empire, the, united, kingdom, s, slavery, abolition, act, 1833, abolished, slavery, throughout, the, british, empire, and, overrode, the, cape, articles, of, capitulation, to, comply, with, the, act, the, south, african, legislation, was, expanded, to, include, ordinance, 1, in, 1835, which, effectively, changed, the, status, of, slaves, to, indentured, labourers, this, was, followed, by, ordinance, 3, in, 1848, which, introduced, an, indenture, system, for, xhosa, that, was, little, different, from, slavery, the, various, south, african, colonies, passed, legislation, throughout, the, rest, of, the, 19th, century, to, limit, the, freedom, of, unskilled, workers, to, increase, the, restrictions, on, indentured, workers, and, to, regulate, the, relations, between, the, races, the, discoveries, of, diamonds, and, gold, in, south, africa, also, raised, racial, inequality, between, white, people, and, black, people, in, the, cape, colony, which, previously, had, a, liberal, and, multi, racial, constitution, and, a, system, of, cape, qualified, franchise, open, to, men, of, all, races, the, franchise, and, ballot, act, of, 1892, raised, the, property, franchise, qualification, and, added, an, educational, element, disenfranchising, a, disproportionate, number, of, the, cape, s, non, white, voters, and, the, glen, grey, act, of, 1894, instigated, by, the, government, of, prime, minister, cecil, rhodes, limited, the, amount, of, land, africans, could, hold, similarly, in, natal, the, natal, legislative, assembly, bill, of, 1894, deprived, indians, of, the, right, to, vote, in, 1896, the, south, african, republic, brought, in, two, pass, laws, requiring, africans, to, carry, a, badge, only, those, employed, by, a, master, were, permitted, to, remain, on, the, rand, and, those, entering, a, labour, district, needed, a, special, pass, during, the, second, boer, war, the, british, empire, cited, racial, exploitation, of, blacks, as, a, cause, for, its, war, against, the, boer, republics, however, the, peace, negotiations, for, the, treaty, of, vereeniging, demanded, the, just, predominance, of, the, white, race, in, south, africa, as, a, precondition, for, the, boer, republics, unifying, with, the, british, empire, in, 1905, the, general, pass, regulations, act, denied, black, people, the, vote, and, limited, them, to, fixed, areas, and, in, 1906, the, asiatic, registration, act, of, the, transvaal, colony, required, all, indians, to, register, and, carry, passes, beginning, in, 1906, the, south, african, native, affairs, commission, under, godfrey, lagden, began, implementing, a, more, openly, segregationist, policy, towards, nonwhites, the, latter, was, repealed, by, the, british, government, but, re, enacted, in, 1908, in, 1910, the, union, of, south, africa, was, created, as, a, self, governing, dominion, which, continued, the, legislative, program, the, south, africa, act, 1910, enfranchised, white, people, giving, them, complete, political, control, over, all, other, racial, groups, while, removing, the, right, of, black, people, to, sit, in, parliament, the, native, land, act, 1913, prevented, black, people, except, those, in, the, cape, from, buying, land, outside, reserves, the, natives, in, urban, areas, bill, 1918, was, designed, to, force, black, people, into, locations, the, urban, areas, act, 1923, introduced, residential, segregation, and, provided, cheap, labour, for, industry, led, by, white, people, the, colour, bar, act, 1926, prevented, black, mine, workers, from, practising, skilled, trades, the, native, administration, act, 1927, made, the, british, crown, rather, than, paramount, chiefs, the, supreme, head, over, all, african, affairs, the, native, land, and, trust, act, 1936, complemented, the, 1913, native, land, act, and, in, the, same, year, the, representation, of, natives, act, removed, previous, black, voters, from, the, cape, voters, roll, and, allowed, them, to, elect, three, whites, to, parliament, the, united, party, government, of, jan, smuts, began, to, move, away, from, the, rigid, enforcement, of, segregationist, laws, during, world, war, ii, but, faced, growing, opposition, from, afrikaner, nationalists, who, wanted, stricter, segregation, post, war, one, of, the, first, pieces, of, segregating, legislation, enacted, by, smuts, government, was, the, asiatic, land, tenure, bill, 1946, which, banned, land, sales, to, indians, and, indian, descendent, south, africans, the, same, year, the, government, established, the, fagan, commission, amid, fears, integration, would, eventually, lead, to, racial, assimilation, the, opposition, herenigde, nasionale, party, hnp, established, the, sauer, commission, to, investigate, the, effects, of, the, united, party, s, policies, the, commission, concluded, that, integration, would, bring, about, a, loss, of, personality, for, all, racial, groups, the, hnp, incorporated, the, commission, s, findings, into, its, campaign, platform, for, the, 1948, south, african, general, election, which, it, won, south, africa, had, allowed, social, custom, and, law, to, govern, the, consideration, of, multiracial, affairs, and, of, the, allocation, in, racial, terms, of, access, to, economic, social, and, political, status, most, white, south, africans, regardless, of, their, own, differences, accepted, the, prevailing, pattern, nevertheless, by, 1948, it, remained, apparent, that, there, were, gaps, in, the, social, structure, whether, legislated, or, otherwise, concerning, the, rights, and, opportunities, of, nonwhites, the, rapid, economic, development, of, world, war, ii, attracted, black, migrant, workers, in, large, numbers, to, chief, industrial, centres, where, they, compensated, for, the, wartime, shortage, of, white, labour, however, this, escalated, rate, of, black, urbanisation, went, unrecognised, by, the, south, african, government, which, failed, to, accommodate, the, influx, with, parallel, expansion, in, housing, or, social, services, overcrowding, increasing, crime, rates, and, disillusionment, resulted, urban, blacks, came, to, support, a, new, generation, of, leaders, influenced, by, the, principles, of, self, determination, and, popular, freedoms, enshrined, in, such, statements, as, the, atlantic, charter, black, political, organisations, and, leaders, such, as, alfred, xuma, james, mpanza, the, african, national, congress, and, the, council, of, non, european, trade, unions, began, demanding, political, rights, land, reform, and, the, right, to, unionise, whites, reacted, negatively, to, the, changes, allowing, the, herenigde, nasionale, party, or, simply, the, national, party, to, convince, a, large, segment, of, the, voting, bloc, that, the, impotence, of, the, united, party, in, curtailing, the, evolving, position, of, nonwhites, indicated, that, the, organisation, had, fallen, under, the, influence, of, western, liberals, many, afrikaners, resented, what, they, perceived, as, disempowerment, by, an, underpaid, black, workforce, and, the, superior, economic, power, and, prosperity, of, white, english, speakers, smuts, as, a, strong, advocate, of, the, united, nations, lost, domestic, support, when, south, africa, was, criticised, for, its, colour, bar, and, the, continued, mandate, of, south, west, africa, by, other, un, member, states, afrikaner, nationalists, proclaimed, that, they, offered, the, voters, a, new, policy, to, ensure, continued, white, domination, this, policy, was, initially, expounded, from, a, theory, drafted, by, hendrik, verwoerd, and, was, presented, to, the, national, party, by, the, sauer, commission, it, called, for, a, systematic, effort, to, organise, the, relations, rights, and, privileges, of, the, races, as, officially, defined, through, a, series, of, parliamentary, acts, and, administrative, decrees, segregation, had, thus, far, been, pursued, only, in, major, matters, such, as, separate, schools, and, local, society, rather, than, law, had, been, depended, upon, to, enforce, most, separation, it, should, now, be, extended, to, everything, the, commission, s, goal, was, to, completely, remove, blacks, from, areas, designated, for, whites, including, cities, with, the, exception, of, temporary, migrant, labour, blacks, would, then, be, encouraged, to, create, their, own, political, units, in, land, reserved, for, them, the, party, gave, this, policy, a, name, apartheid, apartheid, was, to, be, the, basic, ideological, and, practical, foundation, of, afrikaner, politics, for, the, next, quarter, of, a, century, the, national, party, s, election, platform, stressed, that, apartheid, would, preserve, a, market, for, white, employment, in, which, non, whites, could, not, compete, on, the, issues, of, black, urbanisation, the, regulation, of, non, white, labour, influx, control, social, security, farm, tariffs, and, non, white, taxation, the, united, party, s, policy, remained, contradictory, and, confused, its, traditional, bases, of, support, not, only, took, mutually, exclusive, positions, but, found, themselves, increasingly, at, odds, with, each, other, smuts, reluctance, to, consider, south, african, foreign, policy, against, the, mounting, tensions, of, the, cold, war, also, stirred, up, discontent, while, the, nationalists, promised, to, purge, the, state, and, public, service, of, communist, sympathisers, first, to, desert, the, united, party, were, afrikaner, farmers, who, wished, to, see, a, change, in, influx, control, due, to, problems, with, squatters, as, well, as, higher, prices, for, their, maize, and, other, produce, in, the, face, of, the, mineowners, demand, for, cheap, food, policies, always, identified, with, the, affluent, and, capitalist, the, party, also, failed, to, appeal, to, its, working, class, constituents, populist, rhetoric, allowed, the, national, party, to, sweep, eight, constituencies, in, the, mining, and, industrial, centres, of, the, witwatersrand, and, five, more, in, pretoria, barring, the, predominantly, english, speaking, landowner, electorate, of, the, natal, the, united, party, was, defeated, in, almost, every, rural, district, its, urban, losses, in, the, nation, s, most, populous, province, the, transvaal, proved, equally, devastating, as, the, voting, system, was, disproportionately, weighted, in, favour, of, rural, constituencies, and, the, transvaal, in, particular, the, 1948, election, catapulted, the, herenigde, nasionale, party, from, a, small, minority, party, to, a, commanding, position, with, an, eight, vote, parliamentary, lead, daniel, fran, ois, malan, became, the, first, nationalist, prime, minister, with, the, aim, of, implementing, the, apartheid, philosophy, and, silencing, liberal, opposition, when, the, national, party, came, to, power, in, 1948, there, were, factional, differences, in, the, party, about, the, implementation, of, systemic, racial, segregation, the, baasskap, white, domination, or, supremacist, faction, which, was, the, dominant, faction, in, the, np, and, state, institutions, favoured, systematic, segregation, but, also, favoured, the, participation, of, black, africans, in, the, economy, with, black, labour, controlled, to, advance, the, economic, gains, of, afrikaners, a, second, faction, were, the, purists, who, believed, in, vertical, segregation, in, which, blacks, and, whites, would, be, entirely, separated, with, blacks, living, in, native, reserves, with, separate, political, and, economic, structures, which, they, believed, would, entail, severe, short, term, pain, but, would, also, lead, to, independence, of, white, south, africa, from, black, labour, in, the, long, term, a, third, faction, which, included, hendrik, verwoerd, sympathised, with, the, purists, but, allowed, for, the, use, of, black, labour, while, implementing, the, purist, goal, of, vertical, separation, verwoerd, would, refer, to, this, policy, as, a, policy, of, good, neighbourliness, as, a, means, of, justifying, such, segregation, glen, grey, act, 1894, natal, legislative, assembly, bill, 1894,

with, support, from, the, united, party, the, cape, supreme, court, upheld, the, act, but, reversed, by, the, appeal, court, finding, the, act, invalid, because, a, two, thirds, majority, in, a,

to, the, disenfranchised, before, south, africa, became, a, republic, in, 1961, politics, among, white, south, africans, was, typified, by, the, division, between, the, mainly, afrikaner, pro, republic, conservative, and, the, largely, english, anti, republican, liberal, sentiments, with, the, legacy, of, the, boer, war, still, a, factor, for, some, people, once, south, africa, became, a, republic, prime, minister, hendrik, verwoerd, called, for, improved, relations, and, greater, accord, between, people, of, british, descent, and, the, afrikaners, he, claimed, that, the, only, difference, was, between, those, in, favour, of, apartheid, and, those, against, it, the, ethnic, division, would, no, longer, be, between, afrikaans, and, english, speakers, but, between, blacks, and, whites, most, afrikaners, supported, the, notion, of, unanimity, of, white, people, to, ensure, their, safety, white, voters, of, british, descent, were, divided, many, had, opposed, a, republic, leading, to, a, majority, no, vote, in, natal, later, some, of, them, recognised, the, perceived, need, for, white, unity, convinced, by, the, growing, trend, of, decolonisation, elsewhere, in, africa, which, concerned, them, british, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, s, wind, of, change, speech, left, the, british, faction, feeling, that, the, united, kingdom, had, abandoned, them, the, more, conservative, english, speakers, supported, verwoerd, others, were, troubled, by, the, severing, of, ties, with, the, uk, and, remained, loyal, to, the, crown, they, were, displeased, by, having, to, choose, between, british, and, south, african, nationalities, although, verwoerd, tried, to, bond, these, different, blocs, the, subsequent, voting, illustrated, only, a, minor, swell, of, support, indicating, that, a, great, many, english, speakers, remained, apathetic, and, that, verwoerd, had, not, succeeded, in, uniting, the, white, population, under, the, homeland, system, the, government, attempted, to, divide, south, africa, and, south, west, africa, into, a, number, of, separate, states, each, of, which, was, supposed, to, develop, into, a, separate, nation, state, for, a, different, ethnic, group, territorial, separation, was, hardly, a, new, institution, there, were, for, example, the, reserves, created, under, the, british, government, in, the, nineteenth, century, under, apartheid, 13, percent, of, the, land, was, reserved, for, black, homelands, a, small, amount, relative, to, its, total, population, and, generally, in, economically, unproductive, areas, of, the, country, the, tomlinson, commission, of, 1954, justified, apartheid, and, the, homeland, system, but, stated, that, additional, land, ought, to, be, given, to, the, homelands, a, recommendation, that, was, not, carried, out, when, verwoerd, became, prime, minister, in, 1958, the, policy, of, separate, development, came, into, being, with, the, homeland, structure, as, one, of, its, cornerstones, verwoerd, came, to, believe, in, the, granting, of, independence, to, these, homelands, the, government, justified, its, plans, on, the, ostensible, basis, that, the, government, s, policy, is, therefore, not, a, policy, of, discrimination, on, the, grounds, of, race, or, colour, but, a, policy, of, differentiation, on, the, ground, of, nationhood, of, different, nations, granting, to, each, self, determination, within, the, borders, of, their, homelands, hence, this, policy, of, separate, development, under, the, homelands, system, blacks, would, no, longer, be, citizens, of, south, africa, becoming, citizens, of, the, independent, homelands, who, worked, in, south, africa, as, foreign, migrant, labourers, on, temporary, work, permits, in, 1958, the, promotion, of, black, self, government, act, was, passed, and, border, industries, and, the, bantu, investment, corporation, were, established, to, promote, economic, development, and, the, provision, of, employment, in, or, near, the, homelands, many, black, south, africans, who, had, never, resided, in, their, identified, homeland, were, forcibly, removed, from, the, cities, to, the, homelands, the, vision, of, a, south, africa, divided, into, multiple, ethnostates, appealed, to, the, reform, minded, afrikaner, intelligentsia, and, it, provided, a, more, coherent, philosophical, and, moral, framework, for, the, national, party, s, policies, while, also, providing, a, veneer, of, intellectual, respectability, to, the, controversial, policy, of, so, called, baasskap, in, total, 20, homelands, were, allocated, to, ethnic, groups, ten, in, south, africa, proper, and, ten, in, south, west, africa, of, these, 20, homelands, 19, were, classified, as, black, while, one, basterland, was, set, aside, for, a, sub, group, of, coloureds, known, as, basters, who, are, closely, related, to, afrikaners, four, of, the, homelands, were, declared, independent, by, the, south, african, government, transkei, in, 1976, bophuthatswana, in, 1977, venda, in, 1979, and, ciskei, in, 1981, known, as, the, tbvc, states, once, a, homeland, was, granted, its, nominal, independence, its, designated, citizens, had, their, south, african, citizenship, revoked, and, replaced, with, citizenship, in, their, homeland, these, people, were, then, issued, passports, instead, of, passbooks, citizens, of, the, nominally, autonomous, homelands, also, had, their, south, african, citizenship, circumscribed, meaning, they, were, no, longer, legally, considered, south, african, the, south, african, government, attempted, to, draw, an, equivalence, between, their, view, of, black, citizens, of, the, homelands, and, the, problems, which, other, countries, faced, through, entry, of, illegal, immigrants, bantustans, within, the, borders, of, south, africa, and, south, west, africa, were, classified, by, degree, of, nominal, self, rule, 6, were, non, self, governing, 10, were, self, governing, and, 4, were, independent, in, theory, self, governing, bantustans, had, control, over, many, aspects, of, their, internal, functioning, but, were, not, yet, sovereign, nations, independent, bantustans, transkei, bophutatswana, venda, and, ciskei, also, known, as, the, tbvc, states, were, intended, to, be, fully, sovereign, in, reality, they, had, no, significant, economic, infrastructure, and, with, few, exceptions, encompassed, swaths, of, disconnected, territory, this, meant, all, the, bantustans, were, little, more, than, puppet, states, controlled, by, south, africa, throughout, the, existence, of, the, independent, bantustans, south, africa, remained, the, only, country, to, recognise, their, independence, nevertheless, internal, organisations, of, many, countries, as, well, as, the, south, african, government, lobbied, for, their, recognition, for, example, upon, the, foundation, of, transkei, the, swiss, south, african, association, encouraged, the, swiss, government, to, recognise, the, new, state, in, 1976, leading, up, to, a, united, states, house, of, representatives, resolution, urging, the, president, to, not, recognise, transkei, the, south, african, government, intensely, lobbied, lawmakers, to, oppose, the, bill, each, tbvc, state, extended, recognition, to, the, other, independent, bantustans, while, south, africa, showed, its, commitment, to, the, notion, of, tbvc, sovereignty, by, building, embassies, in, the, tbvc, capitals, during, the, 1960s, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, the, government, implemented, a, policy, of, resettlement, to, force, people, to, move, to, their, designated, group, areas, millions, of, people, were, forced, to, relocate, these, removals, included, people, relocated, due, to, slum, clearance, programmes, labour, tenants, on, white, owned, farms, the, inhabitants, of, the, so, called, black, spots, black, owned, land, surrounded, by, white, farms, the, families, of, workers, living, in, townships, close, to, the, homelands, and, surplus, people, from, urban, areas, including, thousands, of, people, from, the, western, cape, which, was, declared, a, coloured, labour, preference, area, who, were, moved, to, the, transkei, and, ciskei, homelands, the, best, publicised, forced, removals, of, the, 1950s, occurred, in, johannesburg, when, 60, 000, people, were, moved, to, the, new, township, of, soweto, an, abbreviation, for, south, western, townships, until, 1955, sophiatown, had, been, one, of, the, few, urban, areas, where, black, people, were, allowed, to, own, land, and, was, slowly, developing, into, a, multiracial, slum, as, industry, in, johannesburg, grew, sophiatown, became, the, home, of, a, rapidly, expanding, black, workforce, as, it, was, convenient, and, close, to, town, it, had, the, only, swimming, pool, for, black, children, in, johannesburg, as, one, of, the, oldest, black, settlements, in, johannesburg, it, held, an, almost, symbolic, importance, for, the, 50, 000, black, people, it, contained, despite, a, vigorous, anc, protest, campaign, and, worldwide, publicity, the, removal, of, sophiatown, began, on, 9, february, 1955, under, the, western, areas, removal, scheme, in, the, early, hours, heavily, armed, police, forced, residents, out, of, their, homes, and, loaded, their, belongings, onto, government, trucks, the, residents, were, taken, to, a, large, tract, of, land, 19, kilometres, 12, mi, from, the, city, centre, known, as, meadowlands, which, the, government, had, purchased, in, 1953, meadowlands, became, part, of, a, new, planned, black, city, called, soweto, sophiatown, was, destroyed, by, bulldozers, and, a, new, white, suburb, named, triomf, triumph, was, built, in, its, place, this, pattern, of, forced, removal, and, destruction, was, to, repeat, itself, over, the, next, few, years, and, was, not, limited, to, black, south, africans, alone, forced, removals, from, areas, like, cato, manor, mkhumbane, in, durban, and, district, six, in, cape, town, where, 55, 000, coloured, and, indian, people, were, forced, to, move, to, new, townships, on, the, cape, flats, were, carried, out, under, the, group, areas, act, of, 1950, nearly, 600, 000, coloured, indian, and, chinese, people, were, moved, under, the, group, areas, act, some, 40, 000, whites, were, also, forced, to, move, when, land, was, transferred, from, white, south, africa, into, the, black, homelands, in, south, west, africa, the, apartheid, plan, that, instituted, bantustans, was, as, a, result, of, the, so, called, odendaal, plan, a, set, of, proposals, from, the, odendaal, commission, of, 1962, 1964, the, np, passed, a, string, of, legislation, that, became, known, as, petty, apartheid, the, first, of, these, was, the, prohibition, of, mixed, marriages, act, 55, of, 1949, prohibiting, marriage, between, whites, and, people, of, other, races, the, immorality, amendment, act, 21, of, 1950, as, amended, in, 1957, by, act, 23, forbade, unlawful, racial, intercourse, and, any, immoral, or, indecent, act, between, a, white, and, a, black, indian, or, coloured, person, black, people, were, not, allowed, to, run, businesses, or, professional, practices, in, areas, designated, as, white, south, africa, unless, they, had, a, permit, such, being, granted, only, exceptionally, without, a, permit, they, were, required, to, move, to, the, black, homelands, and, set, up, businesses, and, practices, there, trains, hospitals, and, ambulances, were, segregated, because, of, the, smaller, numbers, of, white, patients, and, the, fact, that, white, doctors, preferred, to, work, in, white, hospitals, conditions, in, white, hospitals, were, much, better, than, those, in, often, overcrowded, and, understaffed, significantly, underfunded, black, hospitals, residential, areas, were, segregated, and, blacks, were, allowed, to, live, in, white, areas, only, if, employed, as, a, servant, and, even, then, only, in, servants, quarters, black, people, were, excluded, from, working, in, white, areas, unless, they, had, a, pass, nicknamed, the, dompas, also, spelt, dompass, or, dom, pass, the, most, likely, origin, of, this, name, is, from, the, afrikaans, verdomde, pas, meaning, accursed, pass, only, black, people, with, section, 10, rights, those, who, had, migrated, to, the, cities, before, world, war, ii, were, excluded, from, this, provision, a, pass, was, issued, only, to, a, black, person, with, approved, work, spouses, and, children, had, to, be, left, behind, in, black, homelands, a, pass, was, issued, for, one, magisterial, district, usually, one, town, confining, the, holder, to, that, area, only, being, without, a, valid, pass, made, a, person, subject, to, arrest, and, trial, for, being, an, illegal, migrant, this, was, often, followed, by, deportation, to, the, person, s, homeland, and, prosecution, of, the, employer, for, employing, an, illegal, migrant, police, vans, patrolled, white, areas, to, round, up, blacks, without, passes, black, people, were, not, allowed, to, employ, whites, in, white, south, africa, this, legally, enforced, segregation, was, reinforced, through, deliberate, town, planning, measures, such, as, introducing, natural, industrial, and, infrastructural, buffer, zones, the, legacy, of, this, town, planning, element, still, hinders, economic, integration, of, urban, economies, today, although, trade, unions, for, black, and, coloured, workers, had, existed, since, the, early, 20th, century, it, was, not, until, the, 1980s, reforms, that, a, mass, black, trade, union, movement, developed, trade, unions, under, apartheid, were, racially, segregated, with, 54, unions, being, white, only, 38, for, indian, and, coloured, and, 19, for, black, people, the, industrial, conciliation, act, 1956, legislated, against, the, creation, of, multi, racial, trade, unions, and, attempted, to, split, existing, multi,

under, the, churches, native, laws, amendment, act, of, 1957, but, this, was, never, rigidly, enforced, and, churches, were, one, of, the, few, places, races, could, mix, without, the, interference, of, the, law, blacks, earning, 360, rand, a, year, or, more, had, to, pay, taxes, while, the, white, threshold, was, more, than, twice, as, high, at, 750, rand, a, year, on, the, other, hand, the, taxation, rate, for, whites, was, considerably, higher, than, that, for, blacks, blacks, could, not, acquire, land, in, white, areas, in, the, homelands, much, of, the, land, belonged, to, a, tribe, where, the, local, chieftain, would, decide, how, the, land, had, to, be, used, this, resulted, in, whites, owning, almost, all, the, industrial, and, agricultural, lands, and, much, of, the, prized, residential, land, most, blacks, were, stripped, of, their, south, african, citizenship, when, the, homelands, became, independent, and, they, were, no, longer, able, to, apply, for, south, african, passports, eligibility, requirements, for, a, passport, had, been, difficult, for, blacks, to, meet, the, government, contending, that, a, passport, was, a, privilege, not, a, right, and, the,

classified, into, four, groups, african, white, indian, and, coloured, capitalised, to, denote, their, legal, definitions, in, south, african, law, the, coloured, group, included, people, regarded, as, being, of, mixed, descent, including, of, bantu, khoisan, european, and, malay, ancestry, many, were, descended, from, slaves, or, indentured, workers, who, had, been, brought, to, south, africa,

constant, dilemma, for, the, apartheid, government, the, classification, of, honorary, white, a, term, which, would, be, ambiguously, used, throughout, apartheid, was, granted, to, immigrants, from, japan, south, korea, and, taiwan, countries, with, which, south, africa, maintained, diplomatic, and, economic, relations, and, to, their, descendants, indian, south, africans, during, apartheid, were, classified, many, ranges, of, categories, from, asian, to, black, to, coloured, and, even, the, mono, ethnic, category, of, indian, but, never, as, white, having, been, considered, nonwhite, throughout, south, africa, s, history, the, group, faced, severe, discrimination, during, the, apartheid, regime, and, were, subject, to, numerous, racialist, policies, in, 2005, a, retrospect, study, was, done, by, josephine, c, naidoo, and, devi, moodley, rajab, where, they, interviewed, a, series, of, indian, south, africans, about, their, experience, living, through, apartheid, their, study, highlighted, education, the, workplace, and, general, day, to, day, living, one, participant, who, was, a, doctor, said, that, it, was, considered, the, norm, for, non, white, and, white, doctors, to, mingle, while, working, at, the, hospital, but, when, there, was, any, down, time, or, breaks, they, were, to, go, back, to, their, segregated, quarters, not, only, was, there, severe, segregation, for, doctors, non, white, more, specifically, indians, were, paid, three, to, four, times, less, than, their, white, counterparts, many, described, being, treated, as, a, third, class, citizen, due, to, the, humiliation, of, the, standard, of, treatment, for, non, white, employees, across, many, professions, many, indians, described, a, sense, of, justified, superiority, from, whites, due, to, the, apartheid, laws, that, in, the, minds, of, white, south, africans, legitimised, those, feelings, another, finding, of, this, study, was, the, psychological, damage, done, to, indians, living, in, south, africa, during, apartheid, one, of, the, biggest, long, term, effects, on, indians, was, the, distrust, of, white, south, africans, there, was, a, strong, degree, of, alienation, that, left, a, strong, psychological, feeling, of, inferiority, chinese, south, africans, who, were, descendants, of, migrant, workers, who, came, to, work, in, the, gold, mines, around, johannesburg, in, the, late, 19th, century, were, initially, either, classified, as, coloured, or, other, asian, and, were, subject, to, numerous, forms, of, discrimination, and, restriction, it, was, not, until, 1984, that, south, african, chinese, increased, to, about, 10, 000, were, given, the, same, official, rights, as, the, japanese, to, be, treated, as, whites, in, terms, of, the, group, areas, act, although, they, still, faced, discrimination, and, did, not, receive, all, the, benefits, rights, of, their, newly, obtained, honorary, white, status, such, as, voting, indonesians, arrived, at, the, cape, of, good, hope, as, slaves, until, the, abolishment, of, slavery, during, the, 19th, century, they, were, predominantly, muslim, were, allowed, religious, freedom, and, formed, their, own, ethnic, group, community, known, as, cape, malays, they, were, classified, as, part, of, the, coloured, racial, group, this, was, the, same, for, south, africans, of, malaysian, descent, who, were, also, classified, as, part, of, the, coloured, race, and, thus, considered, not, white, south, africans, of, filipino, descent, were, classified, as, black, due, to, historical, outlook, on, filipinos, by, white, south, africans, and, many, of, them, lived, in, bantustans, the, lebanese, population, were, somewhat, of, an, anomaly, during, the, apartheid, era, lebanese, immigration, to, south, africa, was, chiefly, christian, and, the, group, was, originally, classified, as, non, white, however, a, court, case, in, 1913, ruled, that, because, lebanese, and, syrians, originated, from, the, canaan, region, the, birthplace, of, christianity, and, judaism, they, could, not, be, discriminated, against, by, race, laws, which, targeted, non, believers, and, thus, were, classified, as, white, the, lebanese, community, maintained, their, white, status, after, the, population, registration, act, came, into, effect, however, further, immigration, from, the, middle, east, was, restricted,

only, in, cases, of, rape, or, if, the, mother, s, life, was, threatened, television, was, not, introduced, until, 1976, because, the, government, viewed, english, programming, as, a, threat, to, the, afrikaans, language, television, was, run, on, apartheid, lines, tv1, broadcast, in, afrikaans, and, english, geared, to, a, white, audience, tv2, in, zulu, and, xhosa, tv3, in, sotho, tswana, and, pedi, both, geared, to, a, black, audience, and, tv4, mostly, showed, programmes, for, an, urban, black, audience, apartheid, sparked, significant, internal, resistance, the, government, responded, to, a, series, of, popular, uprisings, and, protests, with, police, brutality, which, in, turn, increased, local, support, for, the, armed, resistance, struggle, internal, resistance, to, the, apartheid, system, in, south, africa, came, from, several, sectors, of, society, and, saw, the, creation, of, organisations, dedicated, variously, to, peaceful, protests, passive, resistance, and,

pan, africanist, congress, of, azania, pac, which, organised, a, demonstration, against, pass, books, on, 21, march, 1960, one, of, those, protests, was, held, in, the, township, of, sharpeville,

by, giving, police, the, authority, to, arrest, people, for, up, to, twelve, days, and, detaining, many, strike, leaders, amid, numerous, cases, of, police, brutality, defeated, the, protesters, called, off, their, strike, the, anc, then, chose, to, launch, an, armed, struggle, through, a, newly, formed, military, wing, umkhonto, we, sizwe, mk, which, would, perform, acts, of, sabotage, on, tactical, state, structures, its, first, sabotage, plans, were, carried, out, on, 16, december, 1961, the, anniversary, of, the, battle, of, blood, river, in, the, 1970s, the, black, consciousness, movement, bcm, was, created, by, tertiary, students, influenced, by, the, black, power, movement, in, the, us, bcm, endorsed, black, pride, and, african, customs, and, did, much, to, alter, the, feelings, of, inadequacy, instilled, among, black, people, by, the, apartheid, system, the, leader, of, the, movement, steve, biko, was, taken, into, custody, on, 18, august, 1977, and, was, beaten, to, death, in, detention, in, 1976, secondary, students, in, soweto, took, to, the, streets, in, the, soweto, uprising, to, protest, against, the, imposition, of, afrikaans, as, the, only, language,

usually, given, as, 176, with, estimates, of, up, to, 700, in, the, following, years, several, student, organisations, were, formed, to, protest, against, apartheid, and, these, organisations, were, central, to, urban, school, boycotts, in, 1980, and, 1983, and, rural, boycotts, in, 1985, and, 1986, in, parallel, with, student, protests, labour, unions, started, protest, action, in, 1973, and, 1974, after, 1976, unions, and, workers, are, considered, to, have, played, an, important, role, in, the, struggle, against, apartheid, filling, the, gap, left, by, the, banning, of, political, parties, in, 1979, black, trade, unions, were, legalised, and, could, engage, in, collective, bargaining, although, strikes, were, still, illegal, economist, thomas, sowell, wrote, that, basic, supply, and, demand, led, to, violations, of, apartheid, on, a, massive, scale, throughout, the, nation, simply, because, there, were, not, enough, white, south, african, business, owners, to, meet, the, demand, for, various, goods, and, services, large, portions, of, the, garment, industry, and, construction, of, new, homes, for, example, were, effectively, owned, and, operated, by, blacks, who,

prosecution, and, certain, faith, based, organisations, were, banned, but, the, clergy, generally, had, more, freedom, to, criticise, the, government, than, militant, groups, did, the, udf, coupled, with, the, protection, of, the, church, accordingly, permitted, a, major, role, for, archbishop, desmond, tutu, who, served, both, as, a, prominent, domestic, voice, and, international, spokesperson,

african, countries, condemning, racism, and, inequity, and, calling, for, black, majority, rule, in, all, african, nations, it, did, not, rebuff, south, africa, entirely, though, adopting, an, appeasing, manner, towards, the, apartheid, government, and, even, recognizing, its, autonomy, although, african, leaders, supported, the, emancipation, of, black, south, africans, they, preferred, this, to, be, attained, through, peaceful, means, south, africa, s, negative, response, to, the, lusaka, manifesto, and, rejection, of, a, change, to, its, policies, brought, about, another, oau, announcement, in, october, 1971, the, mogadishu, declaration, stated, that, south, africa, s, rebuffing, of, negotiations, meant, that, its, black, people, could, only, be, freed, through, military,

did, try, to, redress, south, africa, s, isolation, and, to, revitalise, the, country, s, global, reputation, even, those, with, black, majority, rule, in, africa, this, he, called, his, outward, looking, policy, vorster, s, willingness, to, talk, to, african, leaders, stood, in, contrast, to, verwoerd, s, refusal, to, engage, with, leaders, such, as, abubakar, tafawa, balewa, of, nigeria, in, 1962, and, kenneth, kaunda, of, zambia, in, 1964, in, 1966, he, met, the, heads, of, the, neighbouring, states, of, lesotho, swaziland, and, botswana, in, 1967, he, offered, technological, and, financial, aid, to, any, african, state, prepared, to, receive, it, asserting, that, no, political, strings, were, attached, aware, that, many, african, states, needed, financial, aid, despite, their, opposition, to, south, africa, s, racial, policies, many, were, also, tied, to, south, africa, economically, because, of, their, migrant, labour, population, working, down, the, south, african, mines,

formed, relationships, with, south, africa, were, liberia, ivory, coast, madagascar, mauritius, gabon, zaire, now, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, the, central, african, republic, although, these, states, condemned, apartheid, more, than, ever, after, south, africa, s, denunciation, of, the, lusaka, manifesto, south, africa, s, economic, and, military, dominance, meant, that, they, remained, dependent, on, south, africa, to, varying, degrees, south, africa, s, isolation, in, sport, began, in, the, mid, 1950s, and, increased, throughout, the, 1960s, apartheid, forbade,

was, formed, to, secure, the, rights, of, all, players, on, the, global, field, after, meeting, with, no, success, in, its, endeavours, to, attain, credit, by, collaborating, with, white, establishments, sasa, approached, the, international, olympic, committee, ioc, in, 1962, calling, for, south, africa, s, expulsion, from, the, olympic, games, the, ioc, sent, south, africa, a, caution, to, the, effect, that, if, there, were, no, changes, they, would, be, barred, from, competing, at, the, 1964, olympic, games, in, tokyo, the, changes, were, initiated, and, in, january, 1963, the, south, african, non, racial, olympic, committee, sanroc, was, set, up, the, anti, apartheid, movement, persisted, in, its, campaign, for, south, africa, s, exclusion, and, the, ioc, acceded, in, barring, the, country, from, the, 1964, olympic, games, south, africa, selected, a, multi, racial, team, for, the, next, olympic, games, and, the, ioc, opted, for, incorporation, in, the, 1968, mexico, city, olympic, games, because, of, protests, from, aams, and, african, nations, however, the, ioc, was, forced, to, retract, the, invitation, foreign, complaints, about, south, africa, s, bigoted, sports, brought, more, isolation, racially, selected, new, zealand, sports, teams, toured, south, africa, until, the, 1970, all, blacks, rugby, tour, allowed, maori, to, enter, the, country, under, the, status, of, honorary, whites, huge, and, widespread, protests, occurred, in, new, zealand, in, 1981, against, the, springbok, tour, the, government, spent, 8, 000, 000, protecting, games, using, the, army, and, police, force, a, planned, all, black, tour, to, south, africa, in, 1985, remobilised, the, new, zealand, protesters, and, it, was, cancelled, a, rebel, tour, not, government, sanctioned, went, ahead, in, 1986, but, after, that, sporting, ties, were, cut, and, new, zealand, made, a, decision, not, to, convey, an, authorised, rugby, team, to, south, africa, until, the, end, of, apartheid, on, 6, september, 1966, verwoerd, was, fatally, stabbed, at, parliament, house, by, parliamentary, messenger, dimitri, tsafendas, john, vorster, took, office, shortly, after, and, announced, that, south, africa, would, no, longer, dictate, to, the, international, community, what, their, teams, should, look, like, although, this, reopened, the, gate, for, international, sporting, meets, it, did, not, signal, the, end, of, south, africa, s, racist, sporting, policies, in, 1968, vorster, went, against, his, policy, by, refusing, to, permit, basil, d, oliveira, a, coloured, south, african, born, cricketer, to, join, the, english, cricket, team, on, its, tour, to, south, africa, vorster, said, that, the, side, had, been, chosen, only, to, prove, a, point, and, not, on, merit, d, oliveira, was, eventually, included, in, the, team, as, the, first, substitute, but, the, tour, was, cancelled, protests, against, certain, tours, brought, about, the, cancellation, of, a, number, of, other, visits, including, that, of, an, england, rugby, team, touring, south, africa, in, 1969, 70, the, first, of, the, white, bans, occurred, in, 1971, when, the, chairman, of, the, australian, cricketing, association, sir, don, bradman, flew, to, south, africa, to, meet, vorster, vorster, had, expected, bradman, to, allow, the, tour, of, the, australian, cricket, team, to, go, ahead, but, things, became, heated, after, bradman, asked, why, black, sportsmen, were, not, allowed, to, play, cricket, vorster, stated, that, blacks, were, intellectually, inferior, and, had, no, finesse, for, the, game, bradman, thinking, this, ignorant, and, repugnant, asked, vorster, if, he, had, heard, of, a, man, named, garry, sobers, on, his, return, to, australia, bradman, released, a, short, statement, we, will, not, play, them, until, they, choose, a, team, on, a, non, racist, basis, bradman, s, views, were, in, stark, contrast, to, those, of, australian, tennis, great, margaret, court, who, had, won, the, grand, slam, the, previous, year, and, commented, about, apartheid, that, south, africans, have, this, thing, better, organised, than, any, other, country, particularly, america, and, that, she, would, go, back, there, any, time, in, south, africa, vorster, vented, his, anger, publicly, against, bradman, while, the, african, national, congress, rejoiced, this, was, the, first, time, a, predominantly, white, nation, had, taken, the, side, of, multiracial, sport, producing, an, unsettling, resonance, that, more, white, boycotts, were, coming, almost, twenty, years, later, on, his, release, from, prison, nelson, mandela, asked, a, visiting, australian, statesman, if, donald, bradman, his, childhood, hero, was, still, alive, bradman, lived, until, 2001, in, 1971, vorster, altered, his, policies, even, further, by, distinguishing, multiracial, from, multinational, sport, multiracial, sport, between, teams, with, players, of, different, races, remained, outlawed, multinational, sport, however, was, now, acceptable, international, sides, would, not, be, subject, to, south, africa, s, racial, stipulations, in, 1978, nigeria, boycotted, the, commonwealth, games, because, new, zealand, s, sporting, contacts, with, the, south, african, government, were, not, considered, to, be, in, accordance, with, the, 1977, gleneagles, agreement, nigeria, also, led, the, 32, nation, boycott, of, the, 1986, commonwealth, games, because, of, uk, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, s, ambivalent, attitude, towards, sporting, links, with, south, africa, significantly, affecting, the, quality, and, profitability, of, the, games, and, thus, thrusting, apartheid, into, the, international, spotlight, in, the, 1960s, the, anti, apartheid, movements, began, to, campaign, for, cultural, boycotts, of, apartheid, south, africa, artists, were, requested, not, to, present, or, let, their, works, be, hosted, in, south, africa, in, 1963, 45, british, writers, put, their, signatures, to, an, affirmation, approving, of, the, boycott, and, in, 1964, american, actor, marlon, brando, called, for, a, similar, affirmation, for, films, in, 1965, the, writers, guild, of, great, britain, called, for, a, proscription, on, the, sending, of, films, to, south, africa, over, sixty, american, artists, signed, a, statement, against, apartheid, and, against, professional, links, with, the, state, the, presentation, of, some, south, african, plays, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, was, also, vetoed, after, the, arrival, of, television, in, south, africa, in, 1975, the, british, actors, union, equity, boycotted, the, service, and, no, british, programme, concerning, its, associates, could, be, sold, to, south, africa, similarly, when, home, video, grew, popular, in, the, 1980s, the, australian, arm, of, cbs, fox, video, now, 20th, century, fox, home, entertainment, placed, stickers, on, their, vhs, and, betamax, cassettes, which, labelled, exporting, such, cassettes, to, south, africa, as, an, infringement, of, copyright, sporting, and, cultural, boycotts, did, not, have, the, same, effect, as, economic, sanctions, but, they, did, much, to, lift, consciousness, amongst, normal, south, africans, of, the, global, condemnation, of, apartheid, while, international, opposition, to, apartheid, grew, the, nordic, countries, and, sweden, in, particular, provided, both, moral, and, financial, support, for, the, anc, on, 21, february, 1986, a, week, before, he, was, assassinated, sweden, s, prime, minister, olof, palme, made, the, keynote, address, to, the, swedish, people, s, parliament, against, apartheid, held, in, stockholm, in, addressing, the, hundreds, of, anti, apartheid, sympathisers, as, well, as, leaders, and, officials, from, the, anc, and, the, anti, apartheid, movement, such, as, oliver, tambo, palme, declared, apartheid, cannot, be, reformed, it, has, to, be, eliminated, other, western, countries, adopted, a, more, ambivalent, position, in, switzerland, the, swiss, south, african, association, lobbied, on, behalf, of, the, south, african, government, the, nixon, administration, implemented, a, policy, known, as, the, tar, baby, option, pursuant, to, which, the, us, maintained, close, relations, with, the, apartheid, south, african, government, the, reagan, administration, evaded, international, sanctions, and, provided, diplomatic, support, in, international, forums, for, the, south, african, government, the, united, states, also, increased, trade, with, the, apartheid, regime, while, describing, the, anc, as, a, terrorist, organisation, like, the, reagan, administration, the, government, of, margaret, thatcher, termed, this, policy, constructive, engagement, with, the, apartheid, government, vetoing, the, imposition, of, un, economic, sanctions, u, s, government, justification, for, supporting, the, apartheid, regime, were, publicly, given, as, a, belief, in, free, trade, and, the, perception, of, the, anti, communist, south, african, government, as, a, bastion, against, marxist, forces, in, southern, africa, for, example, by, the, military, intervention, of, south, africa, in, the, angolan, civil, war, in, support, of, right, wing, insurgents, fighting, to, topple, the, government, the, u, k, government, also, declared, the, anc, a, terrorist, organisation, and, in, 1987, thatcher, s, spokesman, bernard, ingham, famously, said, that, anyone, who, believed, that, the, anc, would, ever, form, the, government, of, south, africa, was, living, in, cloud, cuckoo, land, the, american, legislative, exchange, council, alec, a, conservative, lobbying, organisation, actively, campaigned, against, divesting, from, south, africa, throughout, the, 1980s, by, the, late, 1980s, with, no, sign, of, a, political, resolution, in, south, africa, western, patience, began, to, run, out, by, 1989, a, bipartisan, republican, democratic, initiative, in, the, us, favoured, economic, sanctions, realised, as, the, comprehensive, anti, apartheid, act, of, 1986, the, release, of, nelson, mandela, and, a, negotiated, settlement, involving, the, anc, thatcher, too, began, to, take, a, similar, line, but, insisted, on, the, suspension, of, the, anc, s, armed, struggle, the, uk, s, significant, economic, involvement, in, south, africa, may, have, provided, some, leverage, with, the, south, african, government, with, both, the, uk, and, the, us, applying, pressure, and, pushing, for, negotiations, however, neither, the, uk, nor, the, us, was, willing, to, apply, economic, pressure, upon, their, multinational, interests, in, south, africa, such, as, the, mining, company, anglo, american, although, a, high, profile, compensation, claim, against, these, companies, was, thrown, out, of, court, in, 2004, the, us, supreme, court, in, may, 2008, upheld, an, appeal, court, ruling, allowing, another, lawsuit, that, seeks, damages, of, more, than, us, 400, billion, from, major, international, companies, which, are, accused, of, aiding, south, africa, s, apartheid, system, during, the, 1950s, south, african, military, strategy, was, decisively, shaped, by, fears, of, communist, espionage, and, a, conventional, soviet, threat, to, the, strategic, cape, trade, route, between, the, south, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, the, apartheid, government, supported, the, us, led, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, nato, as, well, as, its, policy, of, regional, containment, against, soviet, backed, regimes, and, insurgencies, worldwide, by, the, late, 1960s, the, rise, of, soviet, client, states, on, the, african, continent, as, well, as, soviet, aid, for, militant, anti, apartheid, movements, was, considered, one, of, the, primary, external, threats, to, the, apartheid, system, south, african, officials, frequently, accused, domestic, opposition, groups, of, being, communist, proxies, for, its, part, the, soviet, union, viewed, south, africa, as, a, bastion, of, neocolonialism, and, a, regional, western, ally, which, helped, fuel, its, support, for, various, anti, apartheid, causes, from, 1973, onwards, much, of, south, africa, s, white, population, increasingly, looked, upon, their, country, as, a, bastion, of, the, free, world, besieged, militarily, politically, and, culturally, by, communism, and, radical, black, nationalism, the, apartheid, government, perceived, itself, as, being, locked, in, a, proxy, struggle, with, the, warsaw, pact, and, by, implication, armed, wings, of, black, nationalist, forces, such, as, umkhonto, we, sizwe, mk, and, the, people, s, liberation, army, of, namibia, plan, which, often, received, arms, and, training, in, warsaw, pact, member, states, this, was, described, as, total, onslaught, soviet, support, for, militant, anti, apartheid, movements, worked, in, the, government, s, favour, as, its, claim, to, be, reacting, in, opposition, to, aggressive, communist, expansion, gained, greater, plausibility, and, helped, it, justify, its, own, domestic, militarisation, methods, known, as, total, strategy, total, strategy, involved, building, up, a, formidable, conventional, military, and, counter, intelligence, capability, it, was, formulated, on, counter, revolutionary, tactics, as, espoused, by, noted, french, tactician, andr, beaufre, considerable, effort, was, devoted, towards, circumventing, international, arms, sanctions, and, the, government, even, went, so, far, as, to, develop, nuclear, weapons, allegedly, with, covert, assistance, from, israel, in, 2010, the, guardian, released, south, african, government, documents, that, revealed, an, israeli, offer, to, sell, the, apartheid, regime, nuclear, weapons, israel, denied, these, allegations, and, claimed, that, the, documents, were, minutes, from, a, meeting, which, did, not, indicate, any, concrete, offer, for, a, sale, of, nuclear, weapons, shimon, peres, said, that, the, guardian, s, article, was, based, on, selective, interpretation, and, not, on, concrete, facts, as, a, result, of, total, strategy, south, african, society, became, increasingly, militarised, many, domestic, civil, organisations, were, modelled, upon, military, structures, and, military, virtues, such, as, discipline, patriotism, and, loyalty, were, highly, regarded, in, 1968, national, service, for, white, south, african, men, lasted, nine, months, at, minimum, and, they, could, be, called, up, for, reserve, duty, into, their, late, middle, age, if, necessary, the, length, of, national, service, was, gradually, extended, to, 12, months, in, 1972, and, 24, months, in, 1978, at, state, schools, white, male, students, were, organised, into, paramilitary, formations, and, drilled, as, cadets, or, as, participants, in, a, civil, defence, or, youth, preparedness, curriculum, compulsory, military, education, and, in, some, cases, paramilitary, training, was, introduced, for, all, older, white, male, students, at, state, schools, in, three, south, african, provinces, these, programmes, presided, over, the, construction, of, bomb, shelters, at, schools, and, drills, aimed, at, simulating, mock, insurgent, raids, from, the, late, 1970s, to, the, late, 1980s, defence, budgets, in, south, africa, were, raised, exponentially, in, 1975, israeli, defence, minister, shimon, peres, signed, a, security, pact, with, south, african, defence, minister, p, w, botha, that, led, to, 200, million, in, arms, deals, in, 1988, israeli, arm, sales, to, south, africa, totalled, over, 1, 4, billion, covert, operations, focused, on, espionage, and, domestic, counter, subversion, became, common, the, number, of, special, forces, units, swelled, and, the, south, african, defence, force, sadf, had, amassed, enough, sophisticated, conventional, weaponry, to, pose, a, serious, threat, to, the, front, line, states, a, regional, alliance, of, neighbouring, countries, opposed, to, apartheid, total, strategy, was, advanced, in, the, context, of, mk, plan, and, azanian, people, s, liberation, army, apla, guerrilla, raids, into, south, africa, or, against, south, african, targets, in, south, west, africa, frequent, south, african, reprisal, attacks, on, these, movements, external, bases, in, angola, zambia, mozambique, zimbabwe, and, botswana, often, involving, collateral, damage, to, foreign, infrastructure, and, civilian, populations, and, periodic, complaints, brought, before, the, international, community, about, south, african, violations, of, its, neighbours, sovereignty, the, apartheid, government, made, judicious, use, of, extraterritorial, operations, to, eliminate, its, military, and, political, opponents, arguing, that, neighbouring, states, including, their, civilian, populations, which, hosted, tolerated, on, their, soil, or, otherwise, sheltered, anti, apartheid, insurgent, groups, could, not, evade, responsibility, for, provoking, retaliatory, strikes, while, it, did, focus, on, militarising, the, borders, and, sealing, up, its, domestic, territory, against, insurgent, raids, it, also, relied, heavily, on, an, aggressive, preemptive, and, counter, strike, strategy, which, fulfilled, a, preventive, and, deterrent, purpose, the, reprisals, which, occurred, beyond, south, africa, s, borders, involved, not, only, hostile, states, but, neutral, and, sympathetic, governments, as, well, often, forcing, them, to, react, against, their, will, and, interests, external, south, african, military, operations, were, aimed, at, eliminating, the, training, facilities, safehouses, infrastructure, equipment, and, manpower, of, the, insurgents, however, their, secondary, objective, was, to, dissuade, neighbouring, states, from, offering, sanctuary, to, mk, plan, apla, and, similar, organisations, this, was, accomplished, by, deterring, the, supportive, foreign, population, from, cooperating, with, infiltration, and, thus, undermining, the, insurgents, external, sanctuary, areas, it, would, also, send, a, clear, message, to, the, host, government, that, collaborating, with, insurgent, forces, involved, potentially, high, costs, the, scale, and, intensity, of, foreign, operations, varied, and, ranged, from, small, special, forces, units, carrying, out, raids, on, locations, across, the, border, which, served, as, bases, for, insurgent, infiltration, to, major, conventional, offensives, involving, armour, artillery, and, aircraft, actions, such, as, operation, protea, in, 1981, and, operation, askari, in, 1983, involved, both, full, scale, conventional, warfare, and, a, counter, insurgency, reprisal, operation, the, insurgent, bases, were, usually, situated, near, military, installations, of, the, host, government, so, that, sadf, retaliatory, strikes, hit, those, facilities, as, well, and, attracted, international, attention, and, condemnation, of, what, was, perceived, as, aggression, against, the, armed, forces, of, another, sovereign, state, this, would, inevitably, result, in, major, engagements, in, which, the, sadf, s, expeditionary, units, would, have, to, contend, with, the, firepower, of, the, host, government, s, forces, intensive, conventional, warfare, of, this, nature, carried, the, risk, of, severe, casualties, among, white, soldiers, which, had, to, be, kept, to, a, minimum, for, political, reasons, there, were, also, high, economic, and, diplomatic, costs, associated, with, openly, deploying, large, numbers, of, south, african, troops, into, another, country, furthermore, military, involvement, on, that, scale, had, the, potential, to, evolve, into, wider, conflict, situations, in, which, south, africa, became, entangled, for, example, south, africa, s, activities, in, angola, initially, limited, to, containing, plan, later, escalated, to, direct, involvement, in, the, angolan, civil, war, as, it, became, clearer, that, full, scale, conventional, operations, could, not, effectively, fulfil, the, requirements, of, a, regional, counter, insurgency, effort, south, africa, turned, to, a, number, of, alternative, methods, retributive, artillery, bombardments, were, the, least, sophisticated, means, of, reprisal, against, insurgent, attacks, between, 1978, and, 1979, the, sadf, directed, artillery, fire, against, locations, in, angola, and, zambia, from, which, insurgent, rockets, were, suspected, to, have, been, launched, this, precipitated, several, artillery, duels, with, the, zambian, army, special, forces, raids, were, launched, to, harass, plan, and, mk, by, liquidating, prominent, members, of, those, movements, destroying, their, offices, and, safehouses, and, seizing, valuable, records, stored, at, these, sites, one, example, was, the, gaborone, raid, carried, out, in, 1985, during, which, a, south, african, special, forces, team, crossed, the, border, into, botswana, and, demolished, four, suspected, mk, safe, houses, severely, damaging, another, four, other, types, of, special, forces, operations, included, the, sabotage, of, economic, infrastructure, the, sadf, sabotaged, infrastructure, being, used, for, the, insurgents, war, effort, for, example, port, facilities, in, southern, angola, s, mo, medes, district, where, soviet, arms, were, frequently, offloaded, for, plan, as, well, as, the, railway, line, which, facilitated, their, transport, to, plan, headquarters, in, lubango, were, common, targets, sabotage, was, also, used, as, a, pressure, tactic, when, south, africa, was, negotiating, with, a, host, government, to, cease, providing, sanctuary, to, insurgent, forces, as, in, the, case, of, operation, argon, successful, sabotage, actions, of, high, profile, economic, targets, undermined, a, country, s, ability, to, negotiate, from, a, position, of, strength, and, made, it, likelier, to, accede, to, south, african, demands, rather, than, risk, the, expense, of, further, destruction, and, war, also, noteworthy, were, south, african, transnational, espionage, efforts, which, included, covert, assassinations, kidnappings, and, attempts, to, disrupt, the, overseas, influence, of, anti, apartheid, organisations, south, african, military, intelligence, agents, were, known, to, have, abducted, and, killed, anti, apartheid, activists, and, others, suspected, of, having, ties, to, mk, in, london, and, brussels, during, the, 1980s, the, government, led, by, p, w, botha, became, increasingly, preoccupied, with, security, it, set, up, a, powerful, state, security, apparatus, to, protect, the, state, against, an, anticipated, upsurge, in, political, violence, that, the, reforms, were, expected, to, trigger, the, 1980s, became, a, period, of, considerable, political, unrest, with, the, government, becoming, increasingly, dominated, by, botha, s, circle, of, generals, and, police, chiefs, known, as, securocrats, who, managed, the, various, states, of, emergencies, botha, s, years, in, power, were, marked, also, by, numerous, military, interventions, in, the, states, bordering, south, africa, as, well, as, an, extensive, military, and, political, campaign, to, eliminate, swapo, in, namibia, within, south, africa, meanwhile, vigorous, police, action, and, strict, enforcement, of, security, legislation, resulted, in, hundreds, of, arrests, and, bans, and, an, effective, end, to, the, african, national, congress, sabotage, campaign, the, government, punished, political, offenders, brutally, 40, 000, people, annually, were, subjected, to, whipping, as, a, form, of, punishment, the, vast, majority, had, committed, political, offences, and, were, lashed, ten, times, for, their, crime, if, convicted, of, treason, a, person, could, be, hanged, and, the, government, executed, numerous, political, offenders, in, this, way, as, the, 1980s, progressed, more, and, more, anti, apartheid, organisations, were, formed, and, affiliated, with, the, udf, led, by, the, reverend, allan, boesak, and, albertina, sisulu, the, udf, called, for, the, government, to, abandon, its, reforms, and, instead, abolish, the, apartheid, system, and, eliminate, the, homelands, completely, serious, political, violence, was, a, prominent, feature, from, 1985, to, 1989, as, black, townships, became, the, focus, of, the, struggle, between, anti, apartheid, organisations, and, the, botha, government, throughout, the, 1980s, township, people, resisted, apartheid, by, acting, against, the, local, issues, that, faced, their, particular, communities, the, focus, of, much, of, this, resistance, was, against, the, local, authorities, and, their, leaders, who, were, seen, to, be, supporting, the, government, by, 1985, it, had, become, the, anc, s, aim, to, make, black, townships, ungovernable, a, term, later, replaced, by, people, s, power, by, means, of, rent, boycotts, and, other, militant, action, numerous, township, councils, were, overthrown, or, collapsed, to, be, replaced, by, unofficial, popular, organisations, often, led, by, militant, youth, people, s, courts, were, set, up, and, residents, accused, of, being, government, agents, were, dealt, extreme, and, occasionally, lethal, punishments, black, town, councillors, and, policemen, and, sometimes, their, families, were, attacked, with, petrol, bombs, beaten, and, murdered, by, necklacing, where, a, burning, tyre, was, placed, around, the, victim, s, neck, after, they, were, restrained, by, wrapping, their, wrists, with, barbed, wire, on, 20, july, 1985, botha, declared, a, state, of, emergency, in, 36, magisterial, districts, areas, affected, were, the, eastern, cape, and, the, pwv, region, pretoria, witwatersrand, vereeniging, three, months, later, the, western, cape, was, included, an, increasing, number, of, organisations, were, banned, or, listed, restricted, in, some, way, many, individuals, had, restrictions, such, as, house, arrest, imposed, on, them, during, this, state, of, emergency, about, 2, 436, people, were, detained, under, the, internal, security, act, this, act, gave, police, and, the, military, sweeping, powers, the, government, could, implement, curfews, controlling, the, movement, of, people, the, president, could, rule, by, decree, without, referring, to, the, constitution, or, to, parliament, it, became, a, criminal, offence, to, threaten, someone, verbally, or, possess, documents, that, the, government, perceived, to, be, threatening, to, advise, anyone, to, stay, away, from, work, or, to, oppose, the, government, and, to, disclose, the, name, of, anyone, arrested, under, the, state, of, emergency, until, the, government, released, that, name, with, up, to, ten, years, imprisonment, for, these, offences, detention, without, trial, became, a, common, feature, of, the, government, s, reaction, to, growing, civil, unrest, and, by, 1988, 30, 000, people, had, been, detained, the, media, was, censored, thousands, were, arrested, and, many, were, interrogated, and, tortured, on, 12, june, 1986, four, days, before, the, tenth, anniversary, of, the, soweto, uprising, the, state, of, emergency, was, extended, to, cover, the, whole, country, the, government, amended, the, public, security, act, including, the, right, to, declare, unrest, areas, allowing, extraordinary, measures, to, crush, protests, in, these, areas, severe, censorship, of, the, press, became, a, dominant, tactic, in, the, government, s, strategy, and, television, cameras, were, banned, from, entering, such, areas, the, state, broadcaster, the, south, african, broadcasting, corporation, sabc, provided, propaganda, in, support, of, the, government, media, opposition, to, the, system, increased, supported, by, the, growth, of, a, pro, anc, underground, press, within, south, africa, in, 1987, the, state, of, emergency, was, extended, for, another, two, years, meanwhile, about, 200, 000, members, of, the, national, union, of, mineworkers, commenced, the, longest, strike, three, weeks, in, south, african, history, the, year, 1988, saw, the, banning, of, the, activities, of, the, udf, and, other, anti, apartheid, organisations, much, of, the, violence, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, was, directed, at, the, government, but, a, substantial, amount, was, between, the, residents, themselves, many, died, in, violence, between, members, of, inkatha, and, the, udf, anc, faction, it, was, later, proven, that, the, government, manipulated, the, situation, by, supporting, one, side, or, the, other, whenever, it, suited, them, government, agents, assassinated, opponents, within, south, africa, and, abroad, they, undertook, cross, border, army, and, air, force, attacks, on, suspected, anc, and, pac, bases, the, anc, and, the, pac, in, return, detonated, bombs, at, restaurants, shopping, centres, and, government, buildings, such, as, magistrates, courts, between, 1960, and, 1994, according, to, statistics, from, the, truth, and, reconciliation, commission, the, inkatha, freedom, party, was, responsible, for, 4, 500, deaths, south, african, security, forces, were, responsible, for, 2, 700, deaths, and, the, anc, was, responsible, for, 1, 300, deaths, the, state, of, emergency, continued, until, 1990, when, it, was, lifted, by, state, president, f, w, de, klerk, apartheid, developed, from, the, racism, of, colonial, factions, and, due, to, south, africa, s, unique, industrialisation, the, policies, of, industrialisation, led, to, the, segregation, and, classing, of, people, which, was, specifically, developed, to, nurture, early, industry, such, as, mining, cheap, labour, was, the, basis, of, the, economy, and, this, was, taken, from, what, the, state, classed, as, peasant, groups, and, the, migrants, furthermore, philip, bonner, highlights, the, contradictory, economic, effects, as, the, economy, did, not, have, a, manufacturing, sector, therefore, promoting, short, term, profitability, but, limiting, labour, productivity, and, the, size, of, local, markets, this, also, led, to, its, collapse, as, clarkes, emphasises, the, economy, could, not, provide, and, compete, with, foreign, rivals, as, they, failed, to, master, cheap, labour, and, complex, chemistry, the, contradictions, in, the, traditionally, capitalist, economy, of, the, apartheid, state, led, to, considerable, debate, about, racial, policy, and, division, and, conflicts, in, the, central, state, to, a, large, extent, the, political, ideology, of, apartheid, had, emerged, from, the, colonisation, of, africa, by, european, powers, which, institutionalised, racial, discrimination, and, exercised, a, paternal, philosophy, of, civilising, inferior, natives, some, scholars, have, argued, that, this, can, be, reflected, in, afrikaner, calvinism, with, its, parallel, traditions, of, racialism, for, example, as, early, as, 1933, the, executive, council, of, the, broederbond, formulated, a, recommendation, for, mass, segregation, external, western, influence, arising, from, european, experiences, in, colonisation, may, be, seen, as, a, factor, which, greatly, influenced, political, attitudes, and, ideology, late, twentieth, century, south, africa, was, cited, as, an, unreconstructed, example, of, western, civilisation, twisted, by, racism, in, the, 1960s, south, africa, experienced, economic, growth, second, only, to, that, of, japan, trade, with, western, countries, grew, and, investment, from, the, united, states, france, and, the, united, kingdom, poured, in, in, 1974, resistance, to, apartheid, was, encouraged, by, portuguese, withdrawal, from, mozambique, and, angola, after, the, 1974, carnation, revolution, south, african, troops, withdrew, from, angola, early, in, 1976, failing, to, prevent, the, mpla, from, gaining, power, there, and, black, students, in, south, africa, celebrated, the, mahlabatini, declaration, of, faith, signed, by, mangosuthu, buthelezi, and, harry, schwarz, in, 1974, enshrined, the, principles, of, peaceful, transition, of, power, and, equality, for, all, its, purpose, was, to, provide, a, blueprint, for, south, africa, by, consent, and, racial, peace, in, a, multi, racial, society, stressing, opportunity, for, all, consultation, the, federal, concept, and, a, bill, of, rights, it, caused, a, split, in, the, united, party, that, ultimately, realigned, oppositional, politics, in, south, africa, with, the, formation, of, the, progressive, federal, party, in, 1977, the, declaration, was, the, first, of, several, such, joint, agreements, by, acknowledged, black, and, white, political, leaders, in, south, africa, in, 1978, the, national, party, defence, minister, pieter, willem, botha, became, prime, minister, his, white, minority, regime, worried, about, soviet, aid, to, revolutionaries, in, south, africa, at, the, same, time, that, south, african, economic, growth, had, slowed, the, south, african, government, noted, that, it, was, spending, too, much, money, to, maintain, segregated, homelands, created, for, blacks, and, the, homelands, were, proving, to, be, uneconomical, nor, was, maintaining, blacks, as, third, class, citizens, working, well, black, labour, remained, vital, to, the, economy, and, illegal, black, labour, unions, were, flourishing, many, blacks, remained, too, poor, to, contribute, significantly, to, the, economy, through, their, purchasing, power, although, they, composed, more, than, 70, of, the, population, botha, s, regime, feared, that, an, antidote, was, needed, to, prevent, the, blacks, being, attracted, to, communism, in, july, 1979, the, nigerian, government, alleged, that, the, shell, bp, petroleum, development, company, of, nigeria, limited, spdc, was, selling, nigerian, oil, to, south, africa, though, there, was, little, evidence, or, commercial, logic, for, such, sales, the, alleged, sanctions, breaking, was, used, to, justify, the, seizure, of, some, of, bp, s, assets, in, nigeria, including, their, stake, in, spdc, although, it, appears, the, real, reasons, were, economic, nationalism, and, domestic, politics, ahead, of, the, nigerian, elections, many, south, africans, attended, schools, in, nigeria, and, nelson, mandela, acknowledged, the, role, of, nigeria, in, the, struggle, against, apartheid, on, several, occasions, in, the, early, 1980s, botha, s, national, party, government, started, to, recognise, the, inevitability, of, the, need, to, reform, the, apartheid, system, early, reforms, were, driven, by, a, combination, of, internal, violence, international, condemnation, changes, within, the, national, party, s, constituency, and, changing, demographics, whites, constituted, only, 16, of, the, total, population, in, comparison, to, 20, fifty, years, earlier, in, 1983, a, new, constitution, was, passed, implementing, what, was, called, the, tricameral, parliament, giving, coloureds, and, indians, voting, rights, and, parliamentary, representation, in, separate, houses, the, house, of, assembly, 178, members, for, whites, the, house, of, representatives, 85, members, for, coloureds, and, the, house, of, delegates, 45, members, for, indians, each, house, handled, laws, pertaining, to, its, racial, group, s, own, affairs, including, health, education, and, other, community, issues, all, laws, relating, to, general, affairs, matters, such, as, defence, industry, taxation, and, black, affairs, were, handled, by, a, cabinet, made, up, of, representatives, from, all, three, houses, however, the, white, chamber, had, a, large, majority, on, this, cabinet, ensuring, that, effective, control, of, the, country, remained, in, the, hands, of, the, white, minority, blacks, although, making, up, the, majority, of, the, population, were, excluded, from, representation, they, remained, nominal, citizens, of, their, homelands, the, first, tricameral, elections, were, largely, boycotted, by, coloured, and, indian, voters, amid, widespread, rioting, concerned, over, the, popularity, of, mandela, botha, denounced, him, as, an, arch, marxist, committed, to, violent, revolution, but, to, appease, black, opinion, and, nurture, mandela, as, a, benevolent, leader, of, blacks, the, government, transferred, him, from, the, maximum, security, robben, island, to, the, lower, security, pollsmoor, prison, just, outside, cape, town, where, prison, life, was, more, comfortable, for, him, the, government, allowed, mandela, more, visitors, including, visits, and, interviews, by, foreigners, to, let, the, world, know, that, he, was, being, treated, well, black, homelands, were, declared, nation, states, and, pass, laws, were, abolished, black, labour, unions, were, legitimised, the, government, recognised, the, right, of, blacks, to, live, in, urban, areas, permanently, and, gave, blacks, property, rights, there, interest, was, expressed, in, rescinding, the, law, against, interracial, marriage, and, also, rescinding, the, law, against, sexual, relations, between, different, races, which, was, under, ridicule, abroad, the, spending, for, black, schools, increased, to, one, seventh, of, what, was, spent, per, white, child, up, from, on, one, sixteenth, in, 1968, at, the, same, time, attention, was, given, to, strengthening, the, effectiveness, of, the, police, apparatus, in, january, 1985, botha, addressed, the, government, s, house, of, assembly, and, stated, that, the, government, was, willing, to, release, mandela, on, condition, that, mandela, pledge, opposition, to, acts, of, violence, to, further, political, objectives, mandela, s, reply, was, read, in, public, by, his, daughter, zinzi, his, first, words, distributed, publicly, since, his, sentence, to, prison, 21, years, earlier, mandela, described, violence, as, the, responsibility, of, the, apartheid, regime, and, said, that, with, democracy, there, would, be, no, need, for, violence, the, crowd, listening, to, the, reading, of, his, speech, erupted, in, cheers, and, chants, this, response, helped, to, further, elevate, mandela, s, status, in, the, eyes, of, those, both, internationally, and, domestically, who, opposed, apartheid, between, 1986, and, 1988, some, petty, apartheid, laws, were, repealed, along, with, the, pass, laws, botha, told, white, south, africans, to, adapt, or, die, and, twice, he, wavered, on, the, eve, of, what, were, billed, as, rubicon, announcements, of, substantial, reforms, although, on, both, occasions, he, backed, away, from, substantial, changes, ironically, these, reforms, served, only, to, trigger, intensified, political, violence, through, the, remainder, of, the, 1980s, as, more, communities, and, political, groups, across, the, country, joined, the, resistance, movement, botha, s, government, stopped, short, of, substantial, reforms, such, as, lifting, the, ban, on, the, anc, pac, and, sacp, and, other, liberation, organisations, releasing, political, prisoners, or, repealing, the, foundation, laws, of, grand, apartheid, the, government, s, stance, was, that, they, would, not, contemplate, negotiating, until, those, organisations, renounced, violence, by, 1987, south, africa, s, economy, was, growing, at, one, of, the, lowest, rates, in, the, world, and, the, ban, on, south, african, participation, in, international, sporting, events, was, frustrating, many, whites, in, south, africa, examples, of, african, states, with, black, leaders, and, white, minorities, existed, in, kenya, and, zimbabwe, whispers, of, south, africa, one, day, having, a, black, president, sent, more, hardline, whites, into, supporting, right, wing, political, parties, mandela, was, moved, to, a, four, bedroom, house, of, his, own, with, a, swimming, pool, and, shaded, by, fir, trees, on, a, prison, farm, just, outside, of, cape, town, he, had, an, unpublicised, meeting, with, botha, botha, impressed, mandela, by, walking, forward, extending, his, hand, and, pouring, mandela, s, tea, the, two, had, a, friendly, discussion, with, mandela, comparing, the, african, national, congress, rebellion, with, that, of, the, afrikaner, rebellion, and, talking, about, everyone, being, brothers, a, number, of, clandestine, meetings, were, held, between, the, anc, in, exile, and, various, sectors, of, the, internal, struggle, such, as, women, and, educationalists, more, overtly, a, group, of, white, intellectuals, met, the, anc, in, senegal, for, talks, known, as, the, dakar, conference, early, in, 1989, botha, had, a, stroke, he, was, prevailed, upon, to, resign, in, february, 1989, he, was, succeeded, as, president, later, that, year, by, f, w, de, klerk, despite, his, initial, reputation, as, a, conservative, de, klerk, moved, decisively, towards, negotiations, to, end, the, political, stalemate, in, the, country, prior, to, his, term, in, office, f, w, de, klerk, had, already, experienced, political, success, as, a, result, of, the, power, base, he, had, built, in, the, transvaal, during, this, time, f, w, de, klerk, served, as, chairman, to, the, provincial, national, party, which, was, in, favour, of, the, apartheid, regime, the, transition, of, de, klerk, s, ideology, regarding, apartheid, is, seen, clearly, in, his, opening, address, to, parliament, on, 2, february, 1990, f, w, de, klerk, announced, that, he, would, repeal, discriminatory, laws, and, lift, the, 30, year, ban, on, leading, anti, apartheid, groups, such, as, the, african, national, congress, the, pan, africanist, congress, the, south, african, communist, party, sacp, and, the, united, democratic, front, the, land, act, was, brought, to, an, end, f, w, de, klerk, also, made, his, first, public, commitment, to, release, nelson, mandela, to, return, to, press, freedom, and, to, suspend, the, death, penalty, media, restrictions, were, lifted, and, political, prisoners, not, guilty, of, common, law, crimes, were, released, on, 11, february, 1990, nelson, mandela, was, released, from, victor, verster, prison, after, more, than, 27, years, behind, bars, having, been, instructed, by, the, un, security, council, to, end, its, long, standing, involvement, in, south, west, africa, namibia, and, in, the, face, of, military, stalemate, in, southern, angola, and, an, escalation, in, the, size, and, cost, of, the, combat, with, the, cubans, the, angolans, and, swapo, forces, and, the, growing, cost, of, the, border, war, south, africa, negotiated, a, change, of, control, namibia, became, independent, on, 21, march, 1990, apartheid, was, dismantled, in, a, series, of, negotiations, from, 1990, to, 1991, culminating, in, a, transitional, period, which, resulted, in, the, country, s, 1994, general, election, the, first, in, south, africa, held, with, universal, suffrage, in, 1990, negotiations, were, earnestly, begun, with, two, meetings, between, the, government, and, the, anc, the, purpose, of, the, negotiations, was, to, pave, the, way, for, talks, towards, a, peaceful, transition, towards, majority, rule, these, meetings, were, successful, in, laying, down, the, preconditions, for, negotiations, despite, the, considerable, tensions, still, abounding, within, the, country, apartheid, legislation, was, abolished, in, 1991, at, the, first, meeting, the, np, and, anc, discussed, the, conditions, for, negotiations, to, begin, the, meeting, was, held, at, groote, schuur, the, president, s, official, residence, they, released, the, groote, schuur, minute, which, said, that, before, negotiations, commenced, political, prisoners, would, be, freed, and, all, exiles, allowed, to, return, there, were, fears, that, the, change, of, power, would, be, violent, to, avoid, this, it, was, essential, that, a, peaceful, resolution, between, all, parties, be, reached, in, december, 1991, the, convention, for, a, democratic, south, africa, codesa, began, negotiations, on, the, formation, of, a, multiracial, transitional, government, and, a, new, constitution, extending, political, rights, to, all, groups, codesa, adopted, a, declaration, of, intent, and, committed, itself, to, an, undivided, south, africa, reforms, and, negotiations, to, end, apartheid, led, to, a, backlash, among, the, right, wing, white, opposition, leading, to, the, conservative, party, winning, a, number, of, by, elections, against, np, candidates, de, klerk, responded, by, calling, a, whites, only, referendum, in, march, 1992, to, decide, whether, negotiations, should, continue, 68, voted, in, favour, and, the, victory, instilled, in, de, klerk, and, the, government, a, lot, more, confidence, giving, the, np, a, stronger, position, in, negotiations, when, negotiations, resumed, in, may, 1992, under, the, tag, of, codesa, ii, stronger, demands, were, made, the, anc, and, the, government, could, not, reach, a, compromise, on, how, power, should, be, shared, during, the, transition, to, democracy, the, np, wanted, to, retain, a, strong, position, in, a, transitional, government, and, the, power, to, change, decisions, made, by, parliament, persistent, violence, added, to, the, tension, during, the, negotiations, this, was, due, mostly, to, the, intense, rivalry, between, the, inkatha, freedom, party, ifp, and, the, anc, and, the, eruption, of, some, traditional, tribal, and, local, rivalries, between, the, zulu, and, xhosa, historical, tribal, affinities, especially, in, the, southern, natal, provinces, although, mandela, and, buthelezi, met, to, settle, their, differences, they, could, not, stem, the, violence, one, of, the, worst, cases, of, anc, ifp, violence, was, the, boipatong, massacre, of, 17, june, 1992, when, 200, ifp, militants, attacked, the, gauteng, township, of, boipatong, killing, 45, witnesses, said, that, the, men, had, arrived, in, police, vehicles, supporting, claims, that, elements, within, the, police, and, army, contributed, to, the, ongoing, violence, subsequent, judicial, inquiries, found, the, evidence, of, the, witnesses, to, be, unreliable, or, discredited, and, that, there, was, no, evidence, of, national, party, or, police, involvement, in, the, massacre, when, de, klerk, visited, the, scene, of, the, incident, he, was, initially, warmly, welcomed, but, he, was, suddenly, confronted, by, a, crowd, of, protesters, brandishing, stones, and, placards, the, motorcade, sped, from, the, scene, as, police, tried, to, hold, back, the, crowd, shots, were, fired, by, the, police, and, the, pac, stated, that, three, of, its, supporters, had, been, gunned, down, nonetheless, the, boipatong, massacre, offered, the, anc, a, pretext, to, engage, in, brinkmanship, mandela, argued, that, de, klerk, as, head, of, state, was, responsible, for, bringing, an, end, to, the, bloodshed, he, also, accused, the, south, african, police, of, inciting, the, anc, ifp, violence, this, formed, the, basis, for, anc, s, withdrawal, from, the, negotiations, and, the, codesa, forum, broke, down, completely, at, this, stage, the, bisho, massacre, on, 7, september, 1992, brought, matters, to, a, head, the, ciskei, defence, force, killed, 29, people, and, injured, 200, when, they, opened, fire, on, anc, marchers, demanding, the, reincorporation, of, the, ciskei, homeland, into, south, africa, in, the, aftermath, mandela, and, de, klerk, agreed, to, meet, to, find, ways, to, end, the, spiralling, violence, this, led, to, a, resumption, of, negotiations, right, wing, violence, also, added, to, the, hostilities, of, this, period, the, assassination, of, chris, hani, on, 10, april, 1993, threatened, to, plunge, the, country, into, chaos, hani, the, popular, general, secretary, of, the, south, african, communist, party, sacp, was, assassinated, in, 1993, in, dawn, park, in, johannesburg, by, janusz, walu, an, anti, communist, polish, refugee, who, had, close, links, to, the, white, nationalist, afrikaner, weerstandsbeweging, awb, hani, enjoyed, widespread, support, beyond, his, constituency, in, the, sacp, and, anc, and, had, been, recognised, as, a, potential, successor, to, mandela, his, death, brought, forth, protests, throughout, the, country, and, across, the, international, community, but, ultimately, proved, a, turning, point, after, which, the, main, parties, pushed, for, a, settlement, with, increased, determination, on, 25, june, 1993, the, awb, used, an, armoured, vehicle, to, crash, through, the, doors, of, the, kempton, park, world, trade, centre, where, talks, were, still, going, ahead, under, the, negotiating, council, though, this, did, not, derail, the, process, in, addition, to, the, continuing, black, on, black, violence, there, were, a, number, of, attacks,
