the, great, depression, 1929, 1939, was, a, severe, global, economic, downturn, that, affected, many, countries, across, the, world, it, became, evident, after, a, sharp, decline, in, stock, prices, in, the, united, states, the, largest, economy, in, the, world, at, the, time, leading, to, a, period, of, economic, depression, the, economic, contagion, began, around, september, 1929, and, led, to, the, wall, street, stock, market, crash, of, october, black, tuesday, this, crisis, marked, the, start, of, a, prolonged, period, of, economic, hardship, characterized, by, high, unemployment, rates, and, widespread, business, failures, between, 1929, and, 1932, worldwide, gross, domestic, product, gdp, fell, by, an, estimated, 15, by, comparison, worldwide, gdp, fell, by, less, than, 1, from, 2008, to, 2009, during, the, great, recession, some, economies, started, to, recover, by, the, mid, 1930s, however, in, many, countries, the, negative, effects, of, the, great, depression, lasted, until, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, devastating, effects, were, seen, in, both, rich, and, poor, countries, with, falling, personal, income, prices, tax, revenues, and, profits, international, trade, fell, by, more, than, 50, unemployment, in, the, u, s, rose, to, 23, and, in, some, countries, rose, as, high, as, 33, cities, around, the, world, were, severely, affected, especially, those, dependent, on, heavy, industry, construction, was, virtually, halted, in, many, countries, farming, communities, and, rural, areas, suffered, as, crop, prices, fell, by, about, 60, faced, with, plummeting, demand, and, few, job, alternatives, areas, dependent, on, primary, sector, industries, suffered, the, most, economic, historians, usually, consider, the, catalyst, of, the, great, depression, to, be, the, devastating, wall, street, crash, however, some, dispute, this, seeing, the, crash, less, as, a, cause, of, the, depression, and, more, a, symptom, of, the, rising, nervousness, of, investors, partly, due, to, gradual, price, declines, caused, by, falling, sales, of, consumer, goods, as, a, result, of, overproduction, because, of, new, production, techniques, falling, exports, and, income, inequality, among, other, factors, that, had, already, been, underway, as, part, of, a, gradual, depression, after, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, where, the, dow, jones, industrial, average, dropped, from, 381, to, 198, over, the, course, of, two, months, optimism, persisted, for, some, time, the, stock, market, rose, in, early, 1930, with, the, dow, returning, to, 294, pre, depression, levels, in, april, 1930, before, steadily, declining, for, years, to, a, low, of, 41, in, 1932, at, the, beginning, governments, and, businesses, spent, more, in, the, first, half, of, 1930, than, in, the, corresponding, period, of, the, previous, year, on, the, other, hand, consumers, many, of, whom, suffered, severe, losses, in, the, stock, market, the, previous, year, cut, expenditures, by, 10, in, addition, beginning, in, the, mid, 1930s, a, severe, drought, ravaged, the, agricultural, heartland, of, the, u, s, interest, rates, dropped, to, low, levels, by, mid, 1930, but, expected, deflation, and, the, continuing, reluctance, of, people, to, borrow, meant, that, consumer, spending, and, investment, remained, low, by, may, 1930, automobile, sales, declined, to, below, the, levels, of, 1928, prices, in, general, began, to, decline, although, wages, held, steady, in, 1930, then, a, deflationary, spiral, started, in, 1931, farmers, faced, a, worse, outlook, declining, crop, prices, and, a, great, plains, drought, crippled, their, economic, outlook, at, its, peak, the, great, depression, saw, nearly, 10, of, all, great, plains, farms, change, hands, despite, federal, assistance, the, decline, in, the, u, s, economy, was, the, factor, that, pulled, down, most, other, countries, at, first, then, internal, weaknesses, or, strengths, in, each, country, made, conditions, worse, or, better, frantic, attempts, by, individual, countries, to, shore, up, their, economies, through, protectionist, policies, such, as, the, 1930, u, s, smoot, hawley, tariff, act, and, retaliatory, tariffs, in, other, countries, exacerbated, the, collapse, in, global, trade, contributing, to, the, depression, by, 1933, the, economic, decline, pushed, world, trade, to, one, third, of, its, level, compared, to, four, years, earlier, because, the, great, depression, began, in, the, united, states, and, then, spread, around, the, world, the, origins, of, the, great, depression, are, examined, in, the, context, of, the, united, states, economy, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, the, roaring, twenties, had, brought, considerable, wealth, to, the, united, states, and, western, europe, the, year, 1929, dawned, with, considerable, economic, progress, in, the, american, economy, a, small, stock, crash, occurred, on, 25, march, 1929, but, the, crash, was, stabilized, despite, signs, of, economic, trouble, the, market, continued, to, improve, through, september, stock, prices, began, to, slump, in, september, and, were, volatile, at, the, end, of, september, a, large, sell, off, of, stocks, began, in, mid, october, finally, on, 24, october, black, thursday, the, american, stock, market, crashed, 11, at, the, opening, bell, actions, to, stabilize, the, market, failed, and, on, 28, october, black, monday, the, market, crashed, another, 12, the, panic, peaked, the, next, day, on, black, tuesday, when, the, market, saw, another, 11, drop, thousands, of, investors, were, ruined, and, billions, of, dollars, had, been, lost, many, stocks, could, not, be, sold, at, any, price, the, market, recovered, 12, on, wednesday, but, the, damage, had, been, done, though, the, market, recovered, from, 14, november, until, 17, april, 1930, it, entered, a, prolonged, slump, from, 17, april, 1930, until, 8, july, 1932, the, market, continued, to, lose, 89, of, its, value, despite, the, crash, the, worst, of, the, crisis, did, not, reverberate, around, the, world, until, after, 1929, the, crisis, hit, panic, levels, again, in, december, 1930, with, a, bank, run, on, the, bank, of, united, states, privately, run, no, relation, to, the, government, unable, to, pay, out, to, all, of, its, creditors, the, bank, failed, among, the, 608, american, banks, that, closed, in, november, and, december, 1930, the, bank, of, united, states, accounted, for, a, third, of, the, total, 550, million, deposits, lost, and, with, its, closure, bank, failures, reached, a, critical, mass, the, smoot, hawley, tariff, act, was, passed, in, the, united, states, on, 17, june, 1930, having, been, proposed, the, year, prior, ostensibly, aimed, at, protecting, the, american, economy, as, the, depression, began, to, take, root, it, backfired, enormously, and, may, have, even, caused, the, depression, the, consensus, view, among, economists, and, economic, historians, including, keynesians, monetarists, and, austrian, economists, is, that, the, passage, of, the, smoot, hawley, tariff, exacerbated, the, great, depression, although, there, is, disagreement, as, to, how, much, in, the, popular, view, the, smoot, hawley, tariff, was, a, leading, cause, of, the, depression, in, a, 1995, survey, of, american, economic, historians, two, thirds, agreed, that, the, smoot, hawley, tariff, act, at, least, worsened, the, great, depression, according, to, the, u, s, senate, website, the, smoot, hawley, tariff, act, is, among, the, most, catastrophic, acts, in, congressional, history, many, economists, have, argued, that, the, sharp, decline, in, international, trade, after, 1930, helped, to, worsen, the, depression, especially, for, countries, significantly, dependent, on, foreign, trade, most, historians, and, economists, blame, the, act, for, worsening, the, depression, by, seriously, reducing, international, trade, and, causing, retaliatory, tariffs, in, other, countries, while, foreign, trade, was, a, small, part, of, overall, economic, activity, in, the, u, s, and, was, concentrated, in, a, few, businesses, like, farming, it, was, a, much, larger, factor, in, many, other, countries, the, average, ad, valorem, value, based, rate, of, duties, on, dutiable, imports, for, 1921, 1925, was, 25, 9, but, under, the, new, tariff, it, jumped, to, 50, during, 1931, 1935, in, dollar, terms, american, exports, declined, over, the, next, four, years, from, about, 5, 2, billion, in, 1929, to, 1, 7, billion, in, 1933, so, not, only, did, the, physical, volume, of, exports, fall, but, also, the, prices, fell, by, about, 1, 3, as, written, hardest, hit, were, farm, commodities, such, as, wheat, cotton, tobacco, and, lumber, governments, around, the, world, took, various, steps, into, spending, less, money, on, foreign, goods, such, as, imposing, tariffs, import, quotas, and, exchange, controls, these, restrictions, triggered, much, tension, among, countries, that, had, large, amounts, of, bilateral, trade, causing, major, export, import, reductions, during, the, depression, not, all, governments, enforced, the, same, measures, of, protectionism, some, countries, raised, tariffs, drastically, and, enforced, severe, restrictions, on, foreign, exchange, transactions, while, other, countries, reduced, trade, and, exchange, restrictions, only, marginally, the, gold, standard, was, the, primary, transmission, mechanism, of, the, great, depression, even, countries, that, did, not, face, bank, failures, and, a, monetary, contraction, first, hand, were, forced, to, join, the, deflationary, policy, since, higher, interest, rates, in, countries, that, performed, a, deflationary, policy, led, to, a, gold, outflow, in, countries, with, lower, interest, rates, under, the, gold, standard, s, price, specie, flow, mechanism, countries, that, lost, gold, but, nevertheless, wanted, to, maintain, the, gold, standard, had, to, permit, their, money, supply, to, decrease, and, the, domestic, price, level, to, decline, deflation, there, is, also, consensus, that, protectionist, policies, and, primarily, the, passage, of, the, smoot, hawley, tariff, act, helped, to, exacerbate, or, even, cause, the, great, depression, some, economic, studies, have, indicated, that, the, rigidities, of, the, gold, standard, not, only, spread, the, downturn, worldwide, but, also, suspended, gold, convertibility, devaluing, the, currency, in, gold, terms, that, did, the, most, to, make, recovery, possible, every, major, currency, left, the, gold, standard, during, the, great, depression, the, uk, was, the, first, to, do, so, facing, speculative, attacks, on, the, pound, and, depleting, gold, reserves, in, september, 1931, the, bank, of, england, ceased, exchanging, pound, notes, for, gold, and, the, pound, was, floated, on, foreign, exchange, markets, japan, and, the, scandinavian, countries, followed, in, 1931, other, countries, such, as, italy, and, the, united, states, remained, on, the, gold, standard, into, 1932, or, 1933, while, a, few, countries, in, the, so, called, gold, bloc, led, by, france, and, including, poland, belgium, and, switzerland, stayed, on, the, standard, until, 1935, 36, according, to, later, analysis, the, earliness, with, which, a, country, left, the, gold, standard, reliably, predicted, its, economic, recovery, for, example, the, uk, and, scandinavia, which, left, the, gold, standard, in, 1931, recovered, much, earlier, than, france, and, belgium, which, remained, on, gold, much, longer, countries, such, as, china, which, had, a, silver, standard, almost, avoided, the, depression, entirely, the, connection, between, leaving, the, gold, standard, as, a, strong, predictor, of, that, country, s, severity, of, its, depression, and, the, length, of, time, of, its, recovery, has, been, shown, to, be, consistent, for, dozens, of, countries, including, developing, countries, this, partly, explains, why, the, experience, and, length, of, the, depression, differed, between, regions, and, states, around, the, world, the, financial, crisis, escalated, out, of, control, in, mid, 1931, starting, with, the, collapse, of, the, credit, anstalt, in, vienna, in, may, this, put, heavy, pressure, on, germany, which, was, already, in, political, turmoil, with, the, rise, in, violence, of, national, socialist, nazi, and, communist, movements, as, well, as, investor, nervousness, at, harsh, government, financial, policies, investors, withdrew, their, short, term, money, from, germany, as, confidence, spiraled, downward, the, reichsbank, lost, 150, million, marks, in, the, first, week, of, june, 540, million, in, the, second, and, 150, million, in, two, days, 19, 20, june, collapse, was, at, hand, u, s, president, herbert, hoover, called, for, a, moratorium, on, payment, of, war, reparations, this, angered, paris, which, depended, on, a, steady, flow, of, german, payments, but, it, slowed, the, crisis, down, and, the, moratorium, was, agreed, to, in, july, 1931, an, international, conference, in, london, later, in, july, produced, no, agreements, but, on, 19, august, a, standstill, agreement, froze, germany, s, foreign, liabilities, for, six, months, germany, received, emergency, funding, from, private, banks, in, new, york, as, well, as, the, bank, of, international, settlements, and, the, bank, of, england, the, funding, only, slowed, the, process, industrial, failures, began, in, germany, a, major, bank, closed, in, july, and, a, two, day, holiday, for, all, german, banks, was, declared, business, failures, were, more, frequent, in, july, and, spread, to, romania, and, hungary, the, crisis, continued, to, get, worse, in, germany, bringing, political, upheaval, that, finally, led, to, the, coming, to, power, of, hitler, s, nazi, regime, in, january, 1933, the, world, financial, crisis, now, began, to, overwhelm, britain, investors, around, the, world, started, withdrawing, their, gold, from, london, at, the, rate, of, 2, 5, million, per, day, credits, of, 25, million, each, from, the, bank, of, france, and, the, federal, reserve, bank, of, new, york, and, an, issue, of, 15, million, fiduciary, note, slowed, but, did, not, reverse, the, british, crisis, the, financial, crisis, now, caused, a, major, political, crisis, in, britain, in, august, 1931, with, deficits, mounting, the, bankers, demanded, a, balanced, budget, the, divided, cabinet, of, prime, minister, ramsay, macdonald, s, labour, government, agreed, it, proposed, to, raise, taxes, cut, spending, and, most, controversially, to, cut, unemployment, benefits, 20, the, attack, on, welfare, was, unacceptable, to, the, labour, movement, macdonald, wanted, to, resign, but, king, george, v, insisted, he, remain, and, form, an, all, party, coalition, national, government, the, conservative, and, liberals, parties, signed, on, along, with, a, small, cadre, of, labour, but, the, vast, majority, of, labour, leaders, denounced, macdonald, as, a, traitor, for, leading, the, new, government, britain, went, off, the, gold, standard, and, suffered, relatively, less, than, other, major, countries, in, the, great, depression, in, the, 1931, british, election, the, labour, party, was, virtually, destroyed, leaving, macdonald, as, prime, minister, for, a, largely, conservative, coalition, in, most, countries, of, the, world, recovery, from, the, great, depression, began, in, 1933, in, the, u, s, recovery, began, in, early, 1933, but, the, u, s, did, not, return, to, 1929, gnp, for, over, a, decade, and, still, had, an, unemployment, rate, of, about, 15, in, 1940, albeit, down, from, the, high, of, 25, in, 1933, there, is, no, consensus, among, economists, regarding, the, motive, force, for, the, u, s, economic, expansion, that, continued, through, most, of, the, roosevelt, years, and, the, 1937, recession, that, interrupted, it, the, common, view, among, most, economists, is, that, roosevelt, s, new, deal, policies, either, caused, or, accelerated, the, recovery, although, his, policies, were, never, aggressive, enough, to, bring, the, economy, completely, out, of, recession, some, economists, have, also, called, attention, to, the, positive, effects, from, expectations, of, reflation, and, rising, nominal, interest, rates, that, roosevelt, s, words, and, actions, portended, it, was, the, rollback, of, those, same, reflationary, policies, that, led, to, the, interruption, of, a, recession, beginning, in, late, 1937, one, contributing, policy, that, reversed, reflation, was, the, banking, act, of, 1935, which, effectively, raised, reserve, requirements, causing, a, monetary, contraction, that, helped, to, thwart, the, recovery, gdp, returned, to, its, upward, trend, in, 1938, a, revisionist, view, among, some, economists, holds, that, the, new, deal, prolonged, the, great, depression, as, they, argue, that, national, industrial, recovery, act, of, 1933, and, national, labor, relations, act, of, 1935, restricted, competition, and, established, price, fixing, john, maynard, keynes, did, not, think, that, the, new, deal, under, roosevelt, single, handedly, ended, the, great, depression, it, is, it, seems, politically, impossible, for, a, capitalistic, democracy, to, organize, expenditure, on, the, scale, necessary, to, make, the, grand, experiments, which, would, prove, my, case, except, in, war, conditions, according, to, christina, romer, the, money, supply, growth, caused, by, huge, international, gold, inflows, was, a, crucial, source, of, the, recovery, of, the, united, states, economy, and, that, the, economy, showed, little, sign, of, self, correction, the, gold, inflows, were, partly, due, to, devaluation, of, the, u, s, dollar, and, partly, due, to, deterioration, of, the, political, situation, in, europe, in, their, book, a, monetary, history, of, the, united, states, milton, friedman, and, anna, j, schwartz, also, attributed, the, recovery, to, monetary, factors, and, contended, that, it, was, much, slowed, by, poor, management, of, money, by, the, federal, reserve, system, chairman, of, the, federal, reserve, 2006, 2014, ben, bernanke, agreed, that, monetary, factors, played, important, roles, both, in, the, worldwide, economic, decline, and, eventual, recovery, bernanke, also, saw, a, strong, role, for, institutional, factors, particularly, the, rebuilding, and, restructuring, of, the, financial, system, and, pointed, out, that, the, depression, should, be, examined, in, an, international, perspective, women, s, primary, role, was, as, housewives, without, a, steady, flow, of, family, income, their, work, became, much, harder, in, dealing, with, food, and, clothing, and, medical, care, birthrates, fell, everywhere, as, children, were, postponed, until, families, could, financially, support, them, the, average, birthrate, for, 14, major, countries, fell, 12, from, 19, 3, births, per, thousand, population, in, 1930, to, 17, 0, in, 1935, in, canada, half, of, roman, catholic, women, defied, church, teachings, and, used, contraception, to, postpone, births, among, the, few, women, in, the, labor, force, layoffs, were, less, common, in, the, white, collar, jobs, and, they, were, typically, found, in, light, manufacturing, work, however, there, was, a, widespread, demand, to, limit, families, to, one, paid, job, so, that, wives, might, lose, employment, if, their, husband, was, employed, across, britain, there, was, a, tendency, for, married, women, to, join, the, labor, force, competing, for, part, time, jobs, especially, in, france, very, slow, population, growth, especially, in, comparison, to, germany, continued, to, be, a, serious, issue, in, the, 1930s, support, for, increasing, welfare, programs, during, the, depression, included, a, focus, on, women, in, the, family, the, conseil, sup, rieur, de, la, natalit, campaigned, for, provisions, enacted, in, the, code, de, la, famille, 1939, that, increased, state, assistance, to, families, with, children, and, required, employers, to, protect, the, jobs, of, fathers, even, if, they, were, immigrants, in, rural, and, small, town, areas, women, expanded, their, operation, of, vegetable, gardens, to, include, as, much, food, production, as, possible, in, the, united, states, agricultural, organizations, sponsored, programs, to, teach, housewives, how, to, optimize, their, gardens, and, to, raise, poultry, for, meat, and, eggs, rural, women, made, feed, sack, dresses, and, other, items, for, themselves, and, their, families, and, homes, from, feed, sacks, in, american, cities, african, american, women, quiltmakers, enlarged, their, activities, promoted, collaboration, and, trained, neophytes, quilts, were, created, for, practical, use, from, various, inexpensive, materials, and, increased, social, interaction, for, women, and, promoted, camaraderie, and, personal, fulfillment, oral, history, provides, evidence, for, how, housewives, in, a, modern, industrial, city, handled, shortages, of, money, and, resources, often, they, updated, strategies, their, mothers, used, when, they, were, growing, up, in, poor, families, cheap, foods, were, used, such, as, soups, beans, and, noodles, they, purchased, the, cheapest, cuts, of, meat, sometimes, even, horse, meat, and, recycled, the, sunday, roast, into, sandwiches, and, soups, they, sewed, and, patched, clothing, traded, with, their, neighbors, for, outgrown, items, and, made, do, with, colder, homes, new, furniture, and, appliances, were, postponed, until, better, days, many, women, also, worked, outside, the, home, or, took, boarders, did, laundry, for, trade, or, cash, and, did, sewing, for, neighbors, in, exchange, for, something, they, could, offer, extended, families, used, mutual, aid, extra, food, spare, rooms, repair, work, cash, loans, to, help, cousins, and, in, laws, in, japan, official, government, policy, was, deflationary, and, the, opposite, of, keynesian, spending, consequently, the, government, launched, a, campaign, across, the, country, to, induce, households, to, reduce, their, consumption, focusing, attention, on, spending, by, housewives, in, germany, the, government, tried, to, reshape, private, household, consumption, under, the, four, year, plan, of, 1936, to, achieve, german, economic, self, sufficiency, the, nazi, women, s, organizations, other, propaganda, agencies, and, the, authorities, all, attempted, to, shape, such, consumption, as, economic, self, sufficiency, was, needed, to, prepare, for, and, to, sustain, the, coming, war, the, organizations, propaganda, agencies, and, authorities, employed, slogans, that, called, up, traditional, values, of, thrift, and, healthy, living, however, these, efforts, were, only, partly, successful, in, changing, the, behavior, of, housewives, the, common, view, among, economic, historians, is, that, the, great, depression, ended, with, the, advent, of, world, war, ii, many, economists, believe, that, government, spending, on, the, war, caused, or, at, least, accelerated, recovery, from, the, great, depression, though, some, consider, that, it, did, not, play, a, very, large, role, in, the, recovery, though, it, did, help, in, reducing, unemployment, the, rearmament, policies, leading, up, to, world, war, ii, helped, stimulate, the, economies, of, europe, in, 1937, 1939, by, 1937, unemployment, in, britain, had, fallen, to, 1, 5, million, the, mobilization, of, manpower, following, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1939, ended, unemployment, the, american, mobilization, for, world, war, ii, at, the, end, of, 1941, moved, approximately, ten, million, people, out, of, the, civilian, labor, force, and, into, the, war, this, finally, eliminated, the, last, effects, from, the, great, depression, and, brought, the, u, s, unemployment, rate, down, below, 10, world, war, ii, had, a, dramatic, effect, on, many, parts, of, the, american, economy, government, financed, capital, spending, accounted, for, only, 5, of, the, annual, u, s, investment, in, industrial, capital, in, 1940, by, 1943, the, government, accounted, for, 67, of, u, s, capital, investment, the, massive, war, spending, doubled, economic, growth, rates, either, masking, the, effects, of, the, depression, or, essentially, ending, the, depression, businessmen, ignored, the, mounting, national, debt, and, heavy, new, taxes, redoubling, their, efforts, for, greater, output, to, take, advantage, of, generous, government, contracts, during, world, war, i, many, countries, suspended, their, gold, standard, in, varying, ways, there, was, high, inflation, from, wwi, and, in, the, 1920s, in, the, weimar, republic, austria, and, throughout, europe, in, the, late, 1920s, there, was, a, scramble, to, deflate, prices, to, get, the, gold, standard, s, conversation, rates, back, on, track, to, pre, wwi, levels, by, causing, deflation, and, high, unemployment, through, monetary, policy, in, 1933, fdr, signed, executive, order, 6102, and, in, 1934, signed, the, gold, reserve, act, the, two, classic, competing, economic, theories, of, the, great, depression, are, the, keynesian, demand, driven, and, the, monetarist, explanation, there, are, also, various, heterodox, theories, that, downplay, or, reject, the, explanations, of, the, keynesians, and, monetarists, the, consensus, among, demand, driven, theories, is, that, a, large, scale, loss, of, confidence, led, to, a, sudden, reduction, in, consumption, and, investment, spending, once, panic, and, deflation, set, in, many, people, believed, they, could, avoid, further, losses, by, keeping, clear, of, the, markets, holding, money, became, profitable, as, prices, dropped, lower, and, a, given, amount, of, money, bought, ever, more, goods, exacerbating, the, drop, in, demand, monetarists, believe, that, the, great, depression, started, as, an, ordinary, recession, but, the, shrinking, of, the, money, supply, greatly, exacerbated, the, economic, situation, causing, a, recession, to, descend, into, the, great, depression, economists, and, economic, historians, are, almost, evenly, split, as, to, whether, the, traditional, monetary, explanation, that, monetary, forces, were, the, primary, cause, of, the, great, depression, is, right, or, the, traditional, keynesian, explanation, that, a, fall, in, autonomous, spending, particularly, investment, is, the, primary, explanation, for, the, onset, of, the, great, depression, today, there, is, also, significant, academic, support, for, the, debt, deflation, theory, and, the, expectations, hypothesis, that, building, on, the, monetary, explanation, of, milton, friedman, and, anna, schwartz, add, non, monetary, explanations, there, is, a, consensus, that, the, federal, reserve, system, should, have, cut, short, the, process, of, monetary, deflation, and, banking, collapse, by, expanding, the, money, supply, and, acting, as, lender, of, last, resort, if, they, had, done, this, the, economic, downturn, would, have, been, far, less, severe, and, much, shorter, modern, mainstream, economists, see, the, reasons, in, insufficient, spending, the, money, supply, reduction, and, debt, on, margin, led, to, falling, prices, and, further, bankruptcies, irving, fisher, s, debt, deflation, the, monetarist, explanation, was, given, by, american, economists, milton, friedman, and, anna, j, schwartz, they, argued, that, the, great, depression, was, caused, by, the, banking, crisis, that, caused, one, third, of, all, banks, to, vanish, a, reduction, of, bank, shareholder, wealth, and, more, importantly, monetary, contraction, of, 35, which, they, called, the, great, contraction, this, caused, a, price, drop, of, 33, deflation, by, not, lowering, interest, rates, by, not, increasing, the, monetary, base, and, by, not, injecting, liquidity, into, the, banking, system, to, prevent, it, from, crumbling, the, federal, reserve, passively, watched, the, transformation, of, a, normal, recession, into, the, great, depression, friedman, and, schwartz, argued, that, the, downward, turn, in, the, economy, starting, with, the, stock, market, crash, would, merely, have, been, an, ordinary, recession, if, the, federal, reserve, had, taken, aggressive, action, this, view, was, endorsed, in, 2002, by, federal, reserve, governor, ben, bernanke, in, a, speech, honoring, friedman, and, schwartz, with, this, statement, let, me, end, my, talk, by, abusing, slightly, my, status, as, an, official, representative, of, the, federal, reserve, i, would, like, to, say, to, milton, and, anna, regarding, the, great, depression, you, re, right, we, did, it, we, re, very, sorry, but, thanks, to, you, we, won, t, do, it, again, the, federal, reserve, allowed, some, large, public, bank, failures, particularly, that, of, the, new, york, bank, of, united, states, which, produced, panic, and, widespread, runs, on, local, banks, and, the, federal, reserve, sat, idly, by, while, banks, collapsed, friedman, and, schwartz, argued, that, if, the, fed, had, provided, emergency, lending, to, these, key, banks, or, simply, bought, government, bonds, on, the, open, market, to, provide, liquidity, and, increase, the, quantity, of, money, after, the, key, banks, fell, all, the, rest, of, the, banks, would, not, have, fallen, after, the, large, ones, did, and, the, money, supply, would, not, have, fallen, as, far, and, as, fast, as, it, did, with, significantly, less, money, to, go, around, businesses, could, not, get, new, loans, and, could, not, even, get, their, old, loans, renewed, forcing, many, to, stop, investing, this, interpretation, blames, the, federal, reserve, for, inaction, especially, the, new, york, branch, one, reason, why, the, federal, reserve, did, not, act, to, limit, the, decline, of, the, money, supply, was, the, gold, standard, at, that, time, the, amount, of, credit, the, federal, reserve, could, issue, was, limited, by, the, federal, reserve, act, which, required, 40, gold, backing, of, federal, reserve, notes, issued, by, the, late, 1920s, the, federal, reserve, had, almost, hit, the, limit, of, allowable, credit, that, could, be, backed, by, the, gold, in, its, possession, this, credit, was, in, the, form, of, federal, reserve, demand, notes, a, promise, of, gold, is, not, as, good, as, gold, in, the, hand, particularly, when, they, only, had, enough, gold, to, cover, 40, of, the, federal, reserve, notes, outstanding, during, the, bank, panics, a, portion, of, those, demand, notes, was, redeemed, for, federal, reserve, gold, since, the, federal, reserve, had, hit, its, limit, on, allowable, credit, any, reduction, in, gold, in, its, vaults, had, to, be, accompanied, by, a, greater, reduction, in, credit, on, 5, april, 1933, president, roosevelt, signed, executive, order, 6102, making, the, private, ownership, of, gold, certificates, coins, and, bullion, illegal, reducing, the, pressure, on, federal, reserve, gold, british, economist, john, maynard, keynes, argued, in, the, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, that, lower, aggregate, expenditures, in, the, economy, contributed, to, a, massive, decline, in, income, and, to, employment, that, was, well, below, the, average, in, such, a, situation, the, economy, reached, equilibrium, at, low, levels, of, economic, activity, and, high, unemployment, keynes, s, basic, idea, was, simple, to, keep, people, fully, employed, governments, have, to, run, deficits, when, the, economy, is, slowing, as, the, private, sector, would, not, invest, enough, to, keep, production, at, the, normal, level, and, bring, the, economy, out, of, recession, keynesian, economists, called, on, governments, during, times, of, economic, crisis, to, pick, up, the, slack, by, increasing, government, spending, or, cutting, taxes, as, the, depression, wore, on, franklin, d, roosevelt, tried, public, works, farm, subsidies, and, other, devices, to, restart, the, u, s, economy, but, never, completely, gave, up, trying, to, balance, the, budget, according, to, the, keynesians, this, improved, the, economy, but, roosevelt, never, spent, enough, to, bring, the, economy, out, of, recession, until, the, start, of, world, war, ii, irving, fisher, argued, that, the, predominant, factor, leading, to, the, great, depression, was, a, vicious, circle, of, deflation, and, growing, over, indebtedness, he, outlined, nine, factors, interacting, with, one, another, under, conditions, of, debt, and, deflation, to, create, the, mechanics, of, boom, to, bust, the, chain, of, events, proceeded, as, follows, during, the, crash, of, 1929, preceding, the, great, depression, margin, requirements, were, only, 10, brokerage, firms, in, other, words, would, lend, 9, for, every, 1, an, investor, had, deposited, when, the, market, fell, brokers, called, in, these, loans, which, could, not, be, paid, back, banks, began, to, fail, as, debtors, defaulted, on, debt, and, depositors, attempted, to, withdraw, their, deposits, en, masse, triggering, multiple, bank, runs, government, guarantees, and, federal, reserve, banking, regulations, to, prevent, such, panics, were, ineffective, or, not, used, bank, failures, led, to, the, loss, of, billions, of, dollars, in, assets, outstanding, debts, became, heavier, because, prices, and, incomes, fell, by, 20, 50, but, the, debts, remained, at, the, same, dollar, amount, after, the, panic, of, 1929, and, during, the, first, 10, months, of, 1930, 744, u, s, banks, failed, in, all, 9, 000, banks, failed, during, the, 1930s, by, april, 1933, around, 7, billion, in, deposits, had, been, frozen, in, failed, banks, or, those, left, unlicensed, after, the, march, bank, holiday, bank, failures, snowballed, as, desperate, bankers, called, in, loans, that, borrowers, did, not, have, time, or, money, to, repay, with, future, profits, looking, poor, capital, investment, and, construction, slowed, or, completely, ceased, in, the, face, of, bad, loans, and, worsening, future, prospects, the, surviving, banks, became, even, more, conservative, in, their, lending, banks, built, up, their, capital, reserves, and, made, fewer, loans, which, intensified, deflationary, pressures, a, vicious, cycle, developed, and, the, downward, spiral, accelerated, the, liquidation, of, debt, could, not, keep, up, with, the, fall, of, prices, that, it, caused, the, mass, effect, of, the, stampede, to, liquidate, increased, the, value, of, each, dollar, owed, relative, to, the, value, of, declining, asset, holdings, the, very, effort, of, individuals, to, lessen, their, burden, of, debt, effectively, increased, it, paradoxically, the, more, the, debtors, paid, the, more, they, owed, this, self, aggravating, process, turned, a, 1930, recession, into, a, 1933, great, depression, fisher, s, debt, deflation, theory, initially, lacked, mainstream, influence, because, of, the, counter, argument, that, debt, deflation, represented, no, more, than, a, redistribution, from, one, group, debtors, to, another, creditors, pure, re, distributions, should, have, no, significant, macroeconomic, effects, building, on, both, the, monetary, hypothesis, of, milton, friedman, and, anna, schwartz, and, the, debt, deflation, hypothesis, of, irving, fisher, ben, bernanke, developed, an, alternative, way, in, which, the, financial, crisis, affected, output, he, builds, on, fisher, s, argument, that, dramatic, declines, in, the, price, level, and, nominal, incomes, lead, to, increasing, real, debt, burdens, which, in, turn, leads, to, debtor, insolvency, and, consequently, lowers, aggregate, demand, a, further, price, level, decline, would, then, result, in, a, debt, deflationary, spiral, according, to, bernanke, a, small, decline, in, the, price, level, simply, reallocates, wealth, from, debtors, to, creditors, without, doing, damage, to, the, economy, but, when, the, deflation, is, severe, falling, asset, prices, along, with, debtor, bankruptcies, lead, to, a, decline, in, the, nominal, value, of, assets, on, bank, balance, sheets, banks, will, react, by, tightening, their, credit, conditions, which, in, turn, leads, to, a, credit, crunch, that, seriously, harms, the, economy, a, credit, crunch, lowers, investment, and, consumption, which, results, in, declining, aggregate, demand, and, additionally, contributes, to, the, deflationary, spiral, since, economic, mainstream, turned, to, the, new, neoclassical, synthesis, expectations, are, a, central, element, of, macroeconomic, models, according, to, peter, temin, barry, wigmore, gauti, b, eggertsson, and, christina, romer, the, key, to, recovery, and, to, ending, the, great, depression, was, brought, about, by, a, successful, management, of, public, expectations, the, thesis, is, based, on, the, observation, that, after, years, of, deflation, and, a, very, severe, recession, important, economic, indicators, turned, positive, in, march, 1933, when, franklin, d, roosevelt, took, office, consumer, prices, turned, from, deflation, to, a, mild, inflation, industrial, production, bottomed, out, in, march, 1933, and, investment, doubled, in, 1933, with, a, turnaround, in, march, 1933, there, were, no, monetary, forces, to, explain, that, turnaround, money, supply, was, still, falling, and, short, term, interest, rates, remained, close, to, zero, before, march, 1933, people, expected, further, deflation, and, a, recession, so, that, even, interest, rates, at, zero, did, not, stimulate, investment, but, when, roosevelt, announced, major, regime, changes, people, began, to, expect, inflation, and, an, economic, expansion, with, these, positive, expectations, interest, rates, at, zero, began, to, stimulate, investment, just, as, they, were, expected, to, do, roosevelt, s, fiscal, and, monetary, policy, regime, change, helped, make, his, policy, objectives, credible, the, expectation, of, higher, future, income, and, higher, future, inflation, stimulated, demand, and, investment, the, analysis, suggests, that, the, elimination, of, the, policy, dogmas, of, the, gold, standard, a, balanced, budget, in, times, of, crisis, and, small, government, led, endogenously, to, a, large, shift, in, expectation, that, accounts, for, about, 70, 80, of, the, recovery, of, output, and, prices, from, 1933, to, 1937, if, the, regime, change, had, not, happened, and, the, hoover, policy, had, continued, the, economy, would, have, continued, its, free, fall, in, 1933, and, output, would, have, been, 30, lower, in, 1937, than, in, 1933, the, recession, of, 1937, 1938, which, slowed, down, economic, recovery, from, the, great, depression, is, explained, by, fears, of, the, population, that, the, moderate, tightening, of, the, monetary, and, fiscal, policy, in, 1937, were, first, steps, to, a, restoration, of, the, pre, 1933, policy, regime, there, is, common, consensus, among, economists, today, that, the, government, and, the, central, bank, should, work, to, keep, the, interconnected, macroeconomic, aggregates, of, gross, domestic, product, and, money, supply, on, a, stable, growth, path, when, threatened, by, expectations, of, a, depression, central, banks, should, expand, liquidity, in, the, banking, system, and, the, government, should, cut, taxes, and, accelerate, spending, in, order, to, prevent, a, collapse, in, money, supply, and, aggregate, demand, at, the, beginning, of, the, great, depression, most, economists, believed, in, say, s, law, and, the, equilibrating, powers, of, the, market, and, failed, to, understand, the, severity, of, the, depression, outright, leave, it, alone, liquidationism, was, a, common, position, and, was, universally, held, by, austrian, school, economists, the, liquidationist, position, held, that, a, depression, worked, to, liquidate, failed, businesses, and, investments, that, had, been, made, obsolete, by, technological, development, releasing, factors, of, production, capital, and, labor, to, be, redeployed, in, other, more, productive, sectors, of, the, dynamic, economy, they, argued, that, even, if, self, adjustment, of, the, economy, caused, mass, bankruptcies, it, was, still, the, best, course, economists, like, barry, eichengreen, and, j, bradford, delong, note, that, president, herbert, hoover, tried, to, keep, the, federal, budget, balanced, until, 1932, when, he, lost, confidence, in, his, secretary, of, the, treasury, andrew, mellon, and, replaced, him, an, increasingly, common, view, among, economic, historians, is, that, the, adherence, of, many, federal, reserve, policymakers, to, the, liquidationist, position, led, to, disastrous, consequences, unlike, what, liquidationists, expected, a, large, proportion, of, the, capital, stock, was, not, redeployed, but, vanished, during, the, first, years, of, the, great, depression, according, to, a, study, by, olivier, blanchard, and, lawrence, summers, the, recession, caused, a, drop, of, net, capital, accumulation, to, pre, 1924, levels, by, 1933, milton, friedman, called, leave, it, alone, liquidationism, dangerous, nonsense, he, wrote, i, think, the, austrian, business, cycle, theory, has, done, the, world, a, great, deal, of, harm, if, you, go, back, to, the, 1930s, which, is, a, key, point, here, you, had, the, austrians, sitting, in, london, hayek, and, lionel, robbins, and, saying, you, just, have, to, let, the, bottom, drop, out, of, the, world, you, ve, just, got, to, let, it, cure, itself, you, can, t, do, anything, about, it, you, will, only, make, it, worse, i, think, by, encouraging, that, kind, of, do, nothing, policy, both, in, britain, and, in, the, united, states, they, did, harm, two, prominent, theorists, in, the, austrian, school, on, the, great, depression, include, austrian, economist, friedrich, hayek, and, american, economist, murray, rothbard, who, wrote, america, s, great, depression, 1963, in, their, view, much, like, the, monetarists, the, federal, reserve, created, in, 1913, shoulders, much, of, the, blame, however, unlike, the, monetarists, they, argue, that, the, key, cause, of, the, depression, was, the, expansion, of, the, money, supply, in, the, 1920s, which, led, to, an, unsustainable, credit, driven, boom, in, the, austrian, view, it, was, this, inflation, of, the, money, supply, that, led, to, an, unsustainable, boom, in, both, asset, prices, stocks, and, bonds, and, capital, goods, therefore, by, the, time, the, federal, reserve, tightened, in, 1928, it, was, far, too, late, to, prevent, an, economic, contraction, in, february, 1929, hayek, published, a, paper, predicting, the, federal, reserve, s, actions, would, lead, to, a, crisis, starting, in, the, stock, and, credit, markets, according, to, rothbard, the, government, support, for, failed, enterprises, and, efforts, to, keep, wages, above, their, market, values, actually, prolonged, the, depression, unlike, rothbard, after, 1970, hayek, believed, that, the, federal, reserve, had, further, contributed, to, the, problems, of, the, depression, by, permitting, the, money, supply, to, shrink, during, the, earliest, years, of, the, depression, however, during, the, depression, in, 1932, and, in, 1934, hayek, had, criticized, both, the, federal, reserve, and, the, bank, of, england, for, not, taking, a, more, contractionary, stance, hans, sennholz, argued, that, most, boom, and, busts, that, plagued, the, american, economy, such, as, those, in, 1819, 20, 1839, 1843, 1857, 1860, 1873, 1878, 1893, 1897, and, 1920, 21, were, generated, by, government, creating, a, boom, through, easy, money, and, credit, which, was, soon, followed, by, the, inevitable, bust, ludwig, von, mises, wrote, in, the, 1930s, credit, expansion, cannot, increase, the, supply, of, real, goods, it, merely, brings, about, a, rearrangement, it, diverts, capital, investment, away, from, the, course, prescribed, by, the, state, of, economic, wealth, and, market, conditions, it, causes, production, to, pursue, paths, which, it, would, not, follow, unless, the, economy, were, to, acquire, an, increase, in, material, goods, as, a, result, the, upswing, lacks, a, solid, base, it, is, not, real, prosperity, it, is, illusory, prosperity, it, did, not, develop, from, an, increase, in, economic, wealth, i, e, the, accumulation, of, savings, made, available, for, productive, investment, rather, it, arose, because, the, credit, expansion, created, the, illusion, of, such, an, increase, sooner, or, later, it, must, become, apparent, that, this, economic, situation, is, built, on, sand, marxists, generally, argue, that, the, great, depression, was, the, result, of, the, inherent, instability, of, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, according, to, forbes, the, idea, that, capitalism, caused, the, great, depression, was, widely, held, among, intellectuals, and, the, general, public, for, many, decades, two, economists, of, the, 1920s, waddill, catchings, and, william, trufant, foster, popularized, a, theory, that, influenced, many, policy, makers, including, herbert, hoover, henry, a, wallace, paul, douglas, and, marriner, eccles, it, held, the, economy, produced, more, than, it, consumed, because, the, consumers, did, not, have, enough, income, thus, the, unequal, distribution, of, wealth, throughout, the, 1920s, caused, the, great, depression, according, to, this, view, the, root, cause, of, the, great, depression, was, a, global, over, investment, in, heavy, industry, capacity, compared, to, wages, and, earnings, from, independent, businesses, such, as, farms, the, proposed, solution, was, for, the, government, to, pump, money, into, the, consumers, pockets, that, is, it, must, redistribute, purchasing, power, maintaining, the, industrial, base, and, re, inflating, prices, and, wages, to, force, as, much, of, the, inflationary, increase, in, purchasing, power, into, consumer, spending, the, economy, was, overbuilt, and, new, factories, were, not, needed, foster, and, catchings, recommended, federal, and, state, governments, to, start, large, construction, projects, a, program, followed, by, hoover, and, roosevelt, it, cannot, be, emphasized, too, strongly, that, the, trends, we, are, describing, are, long, time, trends, and, were, thoroughly, evident, before, 1929, these, trends, are, in, nowise, the, result, of, the, present, depression, nor, are, they, the, result, of, the, world, war, on, the, contrary, the, present, depression, is, a, collapse, resulting, from, these, long, term, trends, the, first, three, decades, of, the, 20th, century, saw, economic, output, surge, with, electrification, mass, production, and, motorized, farm, machinery, and, because, of, the, rapid, growth, in, productivity, there, was, a, lot, of, excess, production, capacity, and, the, work, week, was, being, reduced, the, dramatic, rise, in, productivity, of, major, industries, in, the, u, s, and, the, effects, of, productivity, on, output, wages, and, the, workweek, are, discussed, by, spurgeon, bell, in, his, book, productivity, wages, and, national, income, 1940, the, majority, of, countries, set, up, relief, programs, and, most, underwent, some, sort, of, political, upheaval, pushing, them, to, the, right, many, of, the, countries, in, europe, and, latin, america, that, were, democracies, saw, them, overthrown, by, some, form, of, dictatorship, or, authoritarian, rule, most, famously, in, germany, in, 1933, the, dominion, of, newfoundland, gave, up, democracy, voluntarily, there, too, were, severe, impacts, across, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, including, economic, decline, which, led, to, social, unrest, decline, in, foreign, trade, hit,

concessions, to, british, exports, by, 1935, the, economy, had, recovered, to, 1929, levels, and, the, same, year, the, central, bank, of, argentina, was, formed, however, the, great, depression, was,

recovery, harshly, affected, by, both, the, global, economic, downturn, and, the, dust, bowl, canadian, industrial, production, had, by, 1932, fallen, to, only, 58, of, its, 1929, figure, the, second, lowest, level, in, the, world, after, the, united, states, and, well, behind, countries, such, as, britain, which, fell, to, only, 83, of, the, 1929, level, total, national, income, fell, to, 56, of,

chile, the, country, hardest, hit, by, the, great, depression, because, 80, of, government, revenue, came, from, exports, of, copper, and, nitrates, which, were, in, low, demand, chile, initially, felt, the, impact, of, the, great, depression, in, 1930, when, gdp, dropped, 14, mining, income, declined, 27, and, export, earnings, fell, 28, by, 1932, gdp, had, shrunk, to, less, than, half, of,

industrialization, consequently, as, in, other, latin, american, countries, protectionism, became, an, entrenched, aspect, of, the, chilean, economy, china, was, largely, unaffected, by, the, depression, mainly, by, having, stuck, to, the, silver, standard, however, the, u, s, silver, purchase, act, of, 1934, created, an, intolerable, demand, on, china, s, silver, coins, and, so, in, the, end, the, silver, standard, was, officially, abandoned, in, 1935, in, favor, of, the, four, chinese, national, banks, legal, note, issues, china, and, the, british, colony, of, hong, kong, which, followed, suit, in, this, regard, in, september, 1935, would, be, the, last, to, abandon, the, silver, standard, in, addition, the, nationalist, government, also, acted, energetically, to, modernize,

colonies, in, africa, and, asia, the, agricultural, sector, was, especially, hard, hit, for, example, sisal, had, recently, become, a, major, export, crop, in, kenya, and, tanganyika, during, the, depression, it, suffered, severely, from, low, prices, and, marketing, problems, that, affected, all, colonial, commodities, in, africa, sisal, producers, established, centralized, controls, for, the, export, of, their, fibre, there, was, widespread, unemployment, and, hardship, among, peasants, labourers, colonial, auxiliaries, and, artisans, the, budgets, of, colonial, governments, were, cut, which, forced, the, reduction, in, ongoing, infrastructure, projects, such, as, the, building, and, upgrading, of, roads, ports, and, communications, the, budget, cuts, delayed, the, schedule, for, creating, systems, of, higher, education, the, depression, severely, hurt, the, export, based, belgian, congo, economy, because, of, the, drop, in, international, demand, for, raw, materials, and, for, agricultural, products, for, example, the, price, of, peanuts, fell, from, 125, to, 25, centimes, in, some, areas, as, in, the, katanga, mining, region, employment, declined, by, 70, in, the, country, as, a, whole, the, wage, labour, force, decreased, by, 72, 000, and, many, men, returned, to, their, villages, in, leopoldville, the, population, decreased, by, 33, because, of, this, labour, migration, political, protests, were, not, common, however, there, was, a, growing, demand, that, the, paternalistic, claims, be, honored, by, colonial, governments, to, respond, vigorously, the, theme, was, that, economic, reforms, were, more, urgently, needed, than, political, reforms, french, west, africa, launched, an, extensive, program, of, educational, reform, in, which, rural, schools, designed, to, modernize, agriculture, would, stem, the, flow, of, under, employed, farm, workers, to, cities, where, unemployment, was, high, students, were, trained, in, traditional, arts, crafts, and, farming, techniques, and, were, then, expected, to, return, to, their, own, villages, and, towns, the, crisis, affected, france, a, bit, later, than, other, countries, hitting, hard, around, 1931, while, the, 1920s, grew, at, the, very, strong, rate, of, 4, 43, per, year, the, 1930s, rate, fell, to, only, 0, 63, the, depression, was, relatively, mild, unemployment, peaked, under, 5, the, fall, in, production, was, at, most, 20, below, the, 1929, output, there, was, no, banking, crisis, however, the, depression, had, drastic, effects, on, the, local, economy, and, partly, explains, the, february, 6, 1934, riots, and, even, more, the, formation, of, the, popular, front, led, by, sfio, socialist, leader, l, on, blum, which, won, the, elections, in, 1936, ultra, nationalist,

moratorium, was, agreed, to, in, july, 1931, an, international, conference, in, london, later, in, july, produced, no, agreements, but, on, 19, august, a, standstill, agreement, froze, germany, s,

business, failures, became, more, frequent, in, july, and, spread, to, romania, and, hungary, in, 1932, 90, of, german, reparation, payments, were, cancelled, in, the, 1950s, germany, repaid, all, its, missed, reparations, debts, widespread, unemployment, reached, 25, as, every, sector, was, hurt, the, government, did, not, increase, government, spending, to, deal, with, germany, s, growing, crisis, as, they, were, afraid, that, a, high, spending, policy, could, lead, to, a, return, of, the, hyperinflation, that, had, affected, germany, in, 1923, germany, s, weimar, republic, was, hit, hard, by, the, depression, as, american, loans, to, help, rebuild, the, german, economy, now, stopped, the, unemployment, rate, reached, nearly, 30, in, 1932, the, german, political, landscape, was, dramatically, altered, leading, to, adolf, hitler, s, rise, to, power, the, nazi, party, rose, from, being, peripheral, to, winning, 18, 3, of, the, vote, in, the, september, 1930, election, and, the, communist, party, also, made, gains, while, moderate, forces, like, the, social, democratic, party, the, democratic, party, and, the, people, s, party, lost, seats, the, next, two, years, were, marked, by, increased, street, violence, between, nazis, and, communists, while, governments, under, president, paul, von, hindenburg, increasingly, relied, on, rule, by, decree, bypassing, the, reichstag, hitler, ran, for, the, presidency, in, 1932, and, while, he, lost, to, the, incumbent, hindenburg, in, the, election, it, marked, a, point, during, which, both, nazi, party, and, the, communist, parties, rose, in, the, years, following, the, crash, to, altogether, possess, a, reichstag, majority, following, the, general, election, in, july, 1932, although, the, nazis, lost, seats, in, november, 1932, election, they, remained, the, largest, party, and, hitler, was, appointed, as, chancellor, the, following, january, the, government, formation, deal, was, designed, to, give, hitler, s, conservative, coalition, partners, many, checks, on, his, power, but, over, the, next, few, months, the, nazis, manoeuvred, to, consolidate, a, single, party, dictatorship, hitler, followed, an, autarky, economic, policy, creating, a, network, of, client, states, and, economic, allies, in, central, europe, and, latin, america, by, cutting, wages, and, taking, control, of, labor, unions, plus, public, works, spending, unemployment, fell, significantly, by, 1935, large, scale, military, spending, played, a, major, role, in, the, recovery, the, policies, had, the, effect, of, driving, up, the, cost, of, food, imports, and, depleting, foreign, currency, reserves, leading, to, economic, impasse, by, 1936, nazi, germany, faced, a, choice, of, either, reversing, course, or, pressing, ahead, with, rearmament, and, autarky, hitler, chose, the, latter, route, which, according, to, ian, kershaw, could, only, be, partially, accomplished, without, territorial, expansion, and, therefore, war, the, reverberations, of, the, great, depression, hit, greece, in, 1932, the, bank, of, greece, tried, to, adopt, deflationary, policies, to, stave, off, the, crises, that, were, going, on, in, other, countries, but, these, largely, failed, for, a, brief, period, the, drachma, was, pegged, to, the, u, s, dollar, but, this, was, unsustainable, given, the, country, s, large, trade, deficit, and, the, only, long, term, effects, of, this, were, greece, s, foreign, exchange, reserves, being, almost, totally, wiped, out, in, 1932, remittances, from, abroad, declined, sharply, and, the, value, of, the, drachma, began, to, plummet, from, 77, drachmas, to, the, dollar, in, march, 1931, to, 111, drachmas, to, the, dollar, in, april, 1931, this, was, especially, harmful, to, greece, as, the, country, relied, on, imports, from, the, uk, france, and, the, middle, east, for, many, necessities, greece, went, off, the, gold, standard, in, april, 1932, and, declared, a, moratorium, on, all, interest, payments, the, country, also, adopted, protectionist, policies, such, as, import, quotas, which, several, european, countries, did, during, the, period, protectionist, policies, coupled, with, a, weak, drachma, stifling, imports, allowed, the, greek, industry, to, expand, during, the, great, depression, in, 1939, the, greek, industrial, output, was, 179, that, of, 1928, these, industries, were, for, the, most, part, built, on, sand, as, one, report, of, the, bank, of, greece, put, it, as, without, massive, protection, they, would, not, have, been, able, to, survive, despite, the, global, depression, greece, managed, to, suffer, comparatively, little, averaging, an, average, growth, rate, of, 3, 5, from, 1932, to, 1939, the, dictatorial, regime, of, ioannis, metaxas, took, over, the, greek, government, in, 1936, and, economic, growth, was, strong, in, the, years, leading, up, to, the, second, world, war, icelandic, post, world, war, i, prosperity, came, to, an, end, with, the, outbreak, of, the, great, depression, the, depression, hit, iceland, hard, as, the, value, of, exports, plummeted, the, total, value, of, icelandic, exports, fell, from, 74, million, kronur, in, 1929, to, 48, million, in, 1932, and, was, not, to, rise, again, to, the, pre, 1930, level, until, after, 1939, government, interference, in, the, economy, increased, imports, were, regulated, trade, with, foreign, currency, was, monopolized, by, state, owned, banks, and, loan, capital, was, largely, distributed, by, state, regulated, funds, due, to, the, outbreak, of, the, spanish, civil, war, which, cut, iceland, s, exports, of, saltfish, by, half, the, depression, lasted, in, iceland, until, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, when, prices, for, fish, exports, soared, how, much, india, was, affected, has, been, hotly, debated, historians, have, argued, that, the, great, depression, slowed, long, term, industrial, development, apart, from, two, sectors, jute, and, coal, the, economy, was, little, affected, however, there, were, major, negative, impacts, on, the, jute, industry, as, world, demand, fell, and, prices, plunged, otherwise, conditions, were, fairly, stable, local, markets, in, agriculture, and, small, scale, industry, showed, modest, gains, frank, barry, and, mary, e, daly, have, argued, that, the, great, depression, hit, italy, very, hard, as, industries, came, close, to, failure, they, were, bought, out, by, the, banks, in, a, largely, illusionary, bail, out, the, assets, used, to, fund, the, purchases, were, largely, worthless, this, led, to, a, financial, crisis, peaking, in, 1932, and, major, government, intervention, the, industrial, reconstruction, institute, iri, was, formed, in, january, 1933, and, took, control, of, the, bank, owned, companies, suddenly, giving, italy, the, largest, state, owned, industrial, sector, in, europe, excluding, the, ussr, iri, did, rather, well, with, its, new, responsibilities, restructuring, modernising, and, rationalising, as, much, as, it, could, it, was, a, significant, factor, in, post, 1945, development, but, it, took, the, italian, economy, until, 1935, to, recover, the, manufacturing, levels, of, 1930, a, position, that, was, only, 60, better, than, that, of, 1913, the, great, depression, did, not, strongly, affect, japan, the, japanese, economy, shrank, by, 8, during, 1929, 31, japan, s, finance, minister, takahashi, korekiyo, was, the, first, to, implement, what, have, come, to, be, identified, as, keynesian, economic, policies, first, by, large, fiscal, stimulus, involving, deficit, spending, and, second, by, devaluing, the, currency, takahashi, used, the, bank, of, japan, to, sterilize, the, deficit, spending, and, minimize, resulting, inflationary, pressures, econometric, studies, have, identified, the, fiscal, stimulus, as, especially, effective, the, devaluation, of, the, currency, had, an, immediate, effect, japanese, textiles, began, to, displace, british, textiles, in, export, markets, the, deficit, spending, proved, to, be, most, profound, and, went, into, the, purchase, of, munitions, for, the, armed, forces, by, 1933, japan, was, already, out, of, the, depression, by, 1934, takahashi, realized, that, the, economy, was, in, danger, of, overheating, and, to, avoid, inflation, moved, to, reduce, the, deficit, spending, that, went, towards, armaments, and, munitions, this, resulted, in, a, strong, and, swift, negative, reaction, from, nationalists, especially, those, in, the, army, culminating, in, his, assassination, in, the, course, of, the, february, 26, incident, this, had, a, chilling, effect, on, all, civilian, bureaucrats, in, the, japanese, government, from, 1934, the, military, s, dominance, of, the, government, continued, to, grow, instead, of, reducing, deficit, spending, the, government, introduced, price, controls, and, rationing, schemes, that, reduced, but, did, not, eliminate, inflation, which, remained, a, problem, until, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, deficit, spending, had, a, transformative, effect, on, japan, japan, s, industrial, production, doubled, during, the, 1930s, further, in, 1929, the, list, of, the, largest, firms, in, japan, was, dominated, by, light, industries, especially, textile, companies, many, of, japan, s, automakers, such, as, toyota, have, their, roots, in, the, textile, industry, by, 1940, light, industry, had, been, displaced, by, heavy, industry, as, the, largest, firms, inside, the, japanese, economy, because, of, high, levels, of, u, s, investment, in, latin, american, economies, they, were, severely, damaged, by, the, depression, within, the, region, chile, bolivia, and, peru, were, particularly, badly, affected, before, the, 1929, crisis, links, between, the, world, economy, and, latin, american, economies, had, been, established, through, american, and, british, investment, in, latin, american, exports, to, the, world, as, a, result, latin, americans, export, industries, felt, the, depression, quickly, world, prices, for, commodities, such, as, wheat, coffee, and, copper, plunged, exports, from, all, of, latin, america, to, the, u, s, fell, in, value, from, 1, 2, billion, in, 1929, to, 335, million, in, 1933, rising, to, 660, million, in, 1940, but, on, the, other, hand, the, depression, led, the, area, governments, to, develop, new, local, industries, and, expand, consumption, and, production, following, the, example, of, the, new, deal, governments, in, the, area, approved, regulations, and, created, or, improved, welfare, institutions, that, helped, millions, of, new, industrial, workers, to, achieve, a, better, standard, of, living, from, roughly, 1931, to, 1937, the, netherlands, suffered, a, deep, and, exceptionally, long, depression, this, depression, was, partly, caused, by, the, after, effects, of, the, american, stock, market, crash, of, 1929, and, partly, by, internal, factors, in, the, netherlands, government, policy, especially, the, very, late, dropping, of, the, gold, standard, played, a, role, in, prolonging, the, depression, the, great, depression, in, the, netherlands, led, to, some, political, instability, and, riots, and, can, be, linked, to, the, rise, of, the, dutch, fascist, political, party, nsb, the, depression, in, the, netherlands, eased, off, somewhat, at, the, end, of, 1936, when, the, government, finally, dropped, the, gold, standard, but, real, economic, stability, did, not, return, until, after, world, war, ii, new, zealand, was, especially, vulnerable, to, worldwide, depression, as, it, relied, almost, entirely, on, agricultural, exports, to, the, united, kingdom, for, its, economy, the, drop, in, exports, led, to, a, lack, of, disposable, income, from, the, farmers, who, were, the, mainstay, of, the, local, economy, jobs, disappeared, and, wages, plummeted, leaving, people, desperate, and, charities, unable, to, cope, work, relief, schemes, were, the, only, government, support, available, to, the, unemployed, the, rate, of, which, by, the, early, 1930s, was, officially, around, 15, but, unofficially, nearly, twice, that, level, official, figures, excluded, m, ori, and, women, in, 1932, riots, occurred, among, the, unemployed, in, three, of, the, country, s, main, cities, auckland, dunedin, and, wellington, many, were, arrested, or, injured, through, the, tough, official, handling, of, these, riots, by, police, and, volunteer, special, constables, in, iran, then, known, as, the, imperial, state, of, persia, the, great, depression, had, negative, impacts, on, its, exports, in, 1933, a, new, concession, was, signed, with, the, anglo, persian, oil, company, poland, was, affected, by, the, great, depression, longer, and, stronger, than, other, countries, due, to, inadequate, economic, response, of, the, government, and, the, pre, existing, economic, circumstances, of, the, country, at, that, time, poland, was, under, the, authoritarian, rule, of, sanacja, whose, leader, j, zef, pi, sudski, was, opposed, to, leaving, the, gold, standard, until, his, death, in, 1935, as, a, result, poland, was, unable, to, perform, a, more, active, monetary, and, budget, policy, additionally, poland, was, a, relatively, young, country, that, emerged, merely, 10, years, earlier, after, being, partitioned, between, german, russian, and, the, austro, hungarian, empires, for, over, a, century, prior, to, independence, the, russian, part, exported, 91, of, its, exports, to, russia, proper, while, the, german, part, exported, 68, to, germany, proper, after, independence, these, markets, were, largely, lost, as, russia, transformed, into, ussr, that, was, mostly, a, closed, economy, and, germany, was, in, a, tariff, war, with, poland, throughout, the, 1920s, industrial, production, fell, significantly, in, 1932, hard, coal, production, was, down, 27, compared, to, 1928, steel, production, was, down, 61, and, iron, ore, production, noted, an, 89, decrease, on, the, other, hand, electrotechnical, leather, and, paper, industries, noted, marginal, increases, in, production, output, overall, industrial, production, decreased, by, 41, a, distinct, feature, of, the, great, depression, in, poland, was, the, de, concentration, of, industry, as, larger, conglomerates, were, less, flexible, and, paid, their, workers, more, than, smaller, ones, unemployment, rate, rose, significantly, up, to, 43, while, nominal, wages, fell, by, 51, in, 1933, and, 56, in, 1934, relative, to, 1928, however, real, wages, fell, less, due, to, the, government, s, policy, of, decreasing, cost, of, living, particularly, food, expenditures, food, prices, were, down, by, 65, in, 1935, compared, to, 1928, price, levels, material, conditions, deprivation, led, to, strikes, some, of, them, violent, or, violently, pacified, like, in, sanok, march, of, the, hungry, in, sanok, 6, march, 1930, lesko, county, lesko, uprising, 21, june, 9, july, 1932, and, zawiercie, bloody, friday, 1930, 18, april, 1930, to, adapt, to, the, crisis, polish, government, employed, deflation, methods, such, as, high, interest, rates, credit, limits, and, budget, austerity, to, keep, a, fixed, exchange, rate, with, currencies, tied, to, the, gold, standard, only, in, late, 1932, did, the, government, effect, a, plan, to, fight, the, economic, crisis, part, of, the, plan, was, mass, public, works, scheme, employing, up, to, 100, 000, people, in, 1935, after, pi, sudski, s, death, in, 1936, the, gold, standard, regime, was, relaxed, and, launching, the, development, of, the, central, industrial, region, kicked, off, the, economy, to, over, 10, annual, growth, rate, in, the, 1936, 1938, period, already, under, the, rule, of, a, dictatorial, junta, the, ditadura, nacional, portugal, suffered, no, turbulent, political, effects, of, the, depression, although, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, already, appointed, minister, of, finance, in, 1928, greatly, expanded, his, powers, and, in, 1932, rose, to, prime, minister, of, portugal, to, found, the, estado, novo, an, authoritarian, corporatist, dictatorship, with, the, budget, balanced, in, 1929, the, effects, of, the, depression, were, relaxed, through, harsh, measures, towards, budget, balance, and, autarky, causing, social, discontent, but, stability, and, eventually, an, impressive, economic, growth, in, the, years, immediately, preceding, the, depression, negative, developments, in, the, island, and, world, economies, perpetuated, an, unsustainable, cycle, of, subsistence, for, many, puerto, rican, workers, the, 1920s, brought, a, dramatic, drop, in, puerto, rico, s, two, primary, exports, raw, sugar, and, coffee, due, to, a, devastating, hurricane, in, 1928, and, the, plummeting, demand, from, global, markets, in, the, latter, half, of, the, decade, 1930, unemployment, on, the, island, was, roughly, 36, and, by, 1933, puerto, rico, s, per, capita, income, dropped, 30, by, comparison, unemployment, in, the, united, states, in, 1930, was, approximately, 8, reaching, a, height, of, 25, in, 1933, to, provide, relief, and, economic, reform, the, united, states, government, and, puerto, rican, politicians, such, as, carlos, chardon, and, luis, mu, oz, mar, n, created, and, administered, first, the, puerto, rico, emergency, relief, administration, prera, 1933, and, then, in, 1935, the, puerto, rico, reconstruction, administration, prra, romania, was, also, affected, by, the, great, depression, as, world, trade, slumped, demand, for, south, african, agricultural, and, mineral, exports, fell, drastically, the, carnegie, commission, on, poor, whites, had, concluded, in, 1931, that, nearly, one, third, of, afrikaners, lived, as, paupers, the, social, discomfort, caused, by, the, depression, was, a, contributing, factor, in, the, 1933, split, between, the, gesuiwerde, purified, and, smelter, fusionist, factions, within, the, national, party, and, the, national, party, s, subsequent, fusion, with, the, south, african, party, unemployment, programs, were, begun, that, focused, primarily, on, the, white, population, the, soviet, union, was, the, only, major, socialist, state, in, the, world, and, had, very, little, international, trade, its, economy, was, not, tied, to, the, rest, of, the, world, and, was, mostly, unaffected, by, the, great, depression, at, the, time, of, the, depression, the, soviet, economy, was, growing, steadily, fuelled, by, intensive, investment, in, heavy, industry, the, apparent, economic, success, of, the, soviet, union, at, a, time, when, the, capitalist, world, was, in, crisis, led, many, western, intellectuals, to, view, the, soviet, system, favorably, jennifer, burns, wrote, as, the, great, depression, ground, on, and, unemployment, soared, intellectuals, began, unfavorably, comparing, their, faltering, capitalist, economy, to, russian, communism, karl, marx, had, predicted, that, capitalism, would, fall, under, the, weight, of, its, own, contradictions, and, now, with, the, economic, crisis, gripping, the, west, his, predictions, seem, to, be, coming, true, by, contrast, russia, seemed, an, emblematic, modern, nation, making, the, staggering, leap, from, a, feudal, past, to, an, industrial, future, with, ease, the, great, depression, caused, mass, immigration, to, the, soviet, union, mostly, from, finland, and, germany, soviet, russia, was, at, first, happy, to, help, these, immigrants, settle, because, they, believed, they, were, victims, of, capitalism, who, had, come, to, help, the, soviet, cause, however, when, the, soviet, union, entered, the, war, in, 1941, most, of, these, germans, and, finns, were, arrested, and, sent, to, siberia,

measures, to, combat, the, depression, were, based, on, encouraging, businesses, not, to, reduce, their, workforce, or, cut, wages, but, businesses, had, little, choice, wages, were, reduced, workers, were, laid, off, and, investments, postponed, in, june, 1930, congress, approved, the, smoot, hawley, tariff, act, which, raised, tariffs, on, thousands, of, imported, items, the, intent, of, the, act, was, to, encourage, the, purchase, of, american, made, products, by, increasing, the, cost, of, imported, goods, while, raising, revenue, for, the, federal, government, and, protecting, farmers, most, countries, that, traded, with, the, u, s, increased, tariffs, on, american, made, goods, in, retaliation, reducing, international, trade, and, worsening, the, depression, in, 1931, hoover,

the, federal, home, loan, bank, act, to, spur, new, home, construction, and, reduce, foreclosures, the, final, attempt, of, the, hoover, administration, to, stimulate, the, economy, was, the, passage, of, the, emergency, relief, and, construction, act, era, which, included, funds, for, public, works, programs, such, as, dams, and, the, creation, of, the, reconstruction, finance, corporation, rfc, in, 1932, the, reconstruction, finance, corporation, was, a, federal, agency, with, the, authority, to, lend, up, to, 2, billion, to, rescue, banks, and, restore, confidence, in, financial, institutions, but, 2, billion, was, not, enough, to, save, all, the, banks, and, bank, runs, and, bank, failures, continued, quarter, by, quarter, the, economy, went, downhill, as, prices, profits, and, employment, fell, leading, to, the, political, realignment, in, 1932, that, brought, to, power, franklin, delano, roosevelt, shortly, after, president, franklin, delano, roosevelt, was, inaugurated, in, 1933, drought, and, erosion, combined, to, cause, the, dust, bowl, shifting, hundreds, of, thousands, of, displaced, persons, off, their, farms, in, the, midwest, from, his,

number, of, sweeping, changes, to, the, american, economy, it, forced, businesses, to, work, with, government, to, set, price, codes, through, the, nra, to, fight, deflationary, cut, throat, competition, by, the, setting, of, minimum, prices, and, wages, labor, standards, and, competitive, conditions, in, all, industries, it, encouraged, unions, that, would, raise, wages, to, increase,

relief, and, recovery, measures, are, called, the, first, new, deal, economic, stimulus, was, attempted, through, a, new, alphabet, soup, of, agencies, set, up, in, 1933, and, 1934, and, previously, extant, agencies, such, as, the, reconstruction, finance, corporation, by, 1935, the, second, new, deal, added, social, security, which, was, later, considerably, extended, through, the, fair, deal, a, jobs, program, for, the, unemployed, the, works, progress, administration, wpa, and, through, the, national, labor, relations, board, a, strong, stimulus, to, the, growth, of, labor, unions, in,

began, when, it, soared, to, 128, by, 1936, the, main, economic, indicators, had, regained, the, levels, of, the, late, 1920s, except, for, unemployment, which, remained, high, at, 11, although, this, was, considerably, lower, than, the, 25, unemployment, rate, seen, in, 1933, in, the, spring, of, 1937, american, industrial, production, exceeded, that, of, 1929, and, remained, level, until, june, 1937, in, june, 1937, the, roosevelt, administration, cut, spending, and, increased, taxation, in, an, attempt, to, balance, the, federal, budget, the, american, economy, then, took, a, sharp,

factor, in, the, implementation, of, social, democracy, and, planned, economies, in, european, countries, after, world, war, ii, see, marshall, plan, keynesianism, generally, remained, the, most, influential, economic, school, in, the, united, states, and, in, parts, of, europe, until, the, periods, between, the, 1970s, and, the, 1980s, when, milton, friedman, and, other, neoliberal, economists, formulated, and, propagated, the, newly, created, theories, of, neoliberalism, and, incorporated, them, into, the, chicago, school, of, economics, as, an, alternative, approach, to, the, study, of, economics, neoliberalism, went, on, to, challenge, the, dominance, of, the, keynesian, school, of, economics, in, the, mainstream, academia, and, policy, making, in, the, united, states,

on, the, subject, is, the, grapes, of, wrath, published, in, 1939, and, written, by, john, steinbeck, who, was, awarded, the, pulitzer, prize, for, the, work, and, in, 1962, was, awarded, the, nobel,

opportunity, a, number, of, works, for, younger, audiences, are, also, set, during, the, great, depression, among, them, the, kit, kittredge, series, of, american, girl, books, written, by, valerie,

protagonist, minnie, swift, as, she, recounts, her, experiences, during, the, era, especially, when, her, family, takes, in, an, orphan, cousin, from, texas, the, term, the, great, depression, is, most, frequently, attributed, to, british, economist, lionel, robbins, whose, 1934, book, the, great, depression, is, credited, with, formalizing, the, phrase, though, hoover, is, widely, credited, with, popularizing, the, term, informally, referring, to, the, downturn, as, a, depression, with, such, uses, as, economic, depression, cannot, be, cured, by, legislative, action, or, executive, pronouncement, december, 1930, message, to, congress, and, i, need, not, recount, to, you, that, the, world, is, passing, through, a, great, depression, 1931, the, term, depression, to, refer, to, an, economic, downturn, dates, to, the, 19th, century, when, it, was, used, by, varied, americans, and, british, politicians, and, economists, the, first, major, american, economic, crisis, the, panic, of, 1819, was, described, by, then, president, james, monroe, as, a, depression, and, the, most, recent, economic, crisis, the, depression, of, 1920, 21, had, been, referred, to, as, a, depression, by, then, president, calvin, coolidge, financial, crises, were, traditionally, referred, to, as, panics, most, recently, the, major, panic, of, 1907, and, the, minor, panic, of, 1910, 11, though, the, 1929, crisis, was, called, the, crash, and, the, term, panic, has, since, fallen, out, of, use, at, the, time, of, the, great, depression, the, term, the, great, depression, was, already, used, to, refer, to, the, period, 1873, 96, in, the, united, kingdom, or, more, narrowly, 1873, 79, in, the, united, states, which, has, retroactively, been, renamed, the, long, depression, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, breakdown, of, economic, ties, which, followed, led, to, a, severe, economic, crisis, and, catastrophic, fall, in, the, standards, of, living, in, the, 1990s, in, post, soviet, states, and, the, former, eastern, bloc, which, was, even, worse, than, the, great, depression, even, before, russia, s, financial, crisis, of, 1998, russia, s, gdp, was, half, of, what, it, had, been, in, the, early, 1990s, the, worldwide, economic, decline, after, 2008, has, been, compared, to, the, 1930s, the, causes, of, the, great, recession, seem, similar, to, the, great, depression, but, significant, differences, exist, the, then, chairman, of, the, federal, reserve, ben, bernanke, had, extensively, studied, the, great, depression, as, part, of, his, doctoral, work, at, mit, and, implemented, policies, to, manipulate, the, money, supply, and, interest, rates, in, ways, that, were, not, done, in, the, 1930s, bernanke, s, policies, will, undoubtedly, be, analyzed, and, scrutinized, in, the, years, to, come, as, economists, debate, the, wisdom, of, his, choices, in, 2011, one, journalist, contrasted, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, as, opposed, to, the, late, 2000s, recession, if, we, contrast, the, 1930s, with, the, crash, of, 2008, where, gold, went, through, the, roof, it, is, clear, that, the, u, s, dollar, on, the, gold, standard, was, a, completely, different, animal, in, comparison, to, the, fiat, free, floating, u, s, dollar, currency, we, have, today, both, currencies, in, 1929, and, 2008, were, the, u, s, dollar, but, analogously, it, is, as, if, one, was, a, saber, toothed, tiger, and, the, other, is, a, bengal, tiger, they, are, two, completely, different, animals, where, we, have, experienced, inflation, since, the, crash, of, 2008, the, situation, was, much, different, in, the, 1930s, when, deflation, set, in, unlike, the, deflation, of, the, early, 1930s, the, u, s, economy, currently, appears, to, be, in, a, liquidity, trap, or, a, situation, where, monetary, policy, is, unable, to, stimulate, an, economy, back, to, health, in, terms, of, the, stock, market, nearly, three, years, after, the, 1929, crash, the, djia, dropped, 8, 4, on, 12, august, 1932, where, we, have, experienced, great, volatility, with, large, intraday, swings, in, the, past, two, months, in, 2011, we, have, not, experienced, any, record, shattering, daily, percentage, drops, to, the, tune, of, the, 1930s, where, many, of, us, may, have, that, 30s, feeling, in, light, of, the, djia, the, cpi, and, the, national, unemployment, rate, we, are, simply, not, living, in, the, 30s, some, individuals, may, feel, as, if, we, are, living, in, a, depression, but, for, many, others, the, current, global, financial, crisis, simply, does, not, feel, like, a, depression, akin, to, the, 1930s, 1928, and, 1929, were, the, times, in, the, 20th, century, that, the, wealth, gap, reached, such, skewed, extremes, half, the, unemployed, had, been, out, of, work, for, over, six, months, something, that, was, not, repeated, until, the, late, 2000s, recession, 2007, and, 2008, eventually, saw, the, world, reach, new, levels, of, wealth, gap, inequality, that, rivalled, the, years, of, 1928, and, 1929, comprehensive, employment, and, training, act
