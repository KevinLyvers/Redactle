the, columbian, exchange, also, known, as, the, columbian, interchange, was, the, widespread, transfer, of, plants, animals, precious, metals, commodities, culture, human, populations, technology, diseases, and, ideas, between, the, new, world, the, americas, in, the, western, hemisphere, and, the, old, world, afro, eurasia, in, the, eastern, hemisphere, in, the, late, 15th, and, following, centuries, it, is, named, after, the, italian, explorer, christopher, columbus, and, is, related, to, the, european, colonization, and, global, trade, following, his, 1492, voyage, some, of, the, exchanges, were, purposeful, while, others, were, unintended, communicable, diseases, of, old, world, origin, resulted, in, an, 80, to, 95, percent, reduction, in, the, number, of, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, from, the, 15th, century, onwards, most, severely, in, the, caribbean, the, cultures, of, both, hemispheres, were, significantly, impacted, by, the, migration, of, people, both, free, and, enslaved, from, the, old, world, to, the, new, european, colonists, and, african, slaves, replaced, indigenous, populations, across, the, americas, to, varying, degrees, the, number, of, africans, taken, to, the, new, world, was, far, greater, than, the, number, of, europeans, moving, to, the, new, world, in, the, first, three, centuries, after, columbus, the, new, contacts, among, the, global, population, resulted, in, the, interchange, of, a, wide, variety, of, crops, and, livestock, which, supported, increases, in, food, production, and, population, in, the, old, world, american, crops, such, as, maize, potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, cassava, sweet, potatoes, and, chili, peppers, became, important, crops, around, the, world, old, world, rice, wheat, sugar, cane, and, livestock, among, other, crops, became, important, in, the, new, world, american, produced, silver, flooded, the, world, and, became, the, standard, metal, used, in, coinage, especially, in, imperial, china, the, term, was, first, used, in, 1972, by, the, american, historian, and, professor, alfred, w, crosby, in, his, environmental, history, book, the, columbian, exchange, it, was, rapidly, adopted, by, other, historians, and, journalists, in, 1972, alfred, w, crosby, an, american, historian, at, the, university, of, texas, at, austin, published, the, book, the, columbian, exchange, and, subsequent, volumes, in, the, 1970s, his, primary, focus, was, mapping, the, biological, and, cultural, transfers, that, occurred, between, the, old, and, new, worlds, he, studied, the, effects, of, columbus, s, voyages, between, the, two, specifically, the, global, diffusion, of, crops, seeds, and, plants, from, the, new, world, to, the, old, which, radically, transformed, agriculture, in, both, regions, his, research, made, a, lasting, contribution, to, the, way, scholars, understand, the, variety, of, contemporary, ecosystems, that, arose, due, to, these, transfers, the, term, has, become, popular, among, historians, and, journalists, and, has, since, been, enhanced, with, crosby, s, later, book, in, three, editions, ecological, imperialism, the, biological, expansion, of, europe, 900, 1900, charles, c, mann, in, his, book, 1493, further, expands, and, updates, crosby, s, original, research, the, weight, of, scientific, evidence, is, that, humans, first, came, to, the, new, world, from, siberia, thousands, of, years, ago, there, is, little, additional, evidence, of, contacts, between, the, peoples, of, the, old, world, and, those, of, the, new, world, although, the, literature, speculating, on, pre, columbian, trans, oceanic, journeys, is, extensive, the, first, inhabitants, of, the, new, world, brought, with, them, domestic, dogs, and, possibly, a, container, the, calabash, both, of, which, persisted, in, their, new, home, the, medieval, explorations, visits, and, brief, residence, of, the, norsemen, in, greenland, newfoundland, and, vinland, in, the, late, 10th, century, and, 11th, century, had, no, known, impact, on, the, americas, many, scientists, accept, that, possible, contact, between, polynesians, and, coastal, peoples, in, south, america, around, the, year, 1200, resulted, in, genetic, similarities, and, the, adoption, by, polynesians, of, an, american, crop, the, sweet, potato, however, it, was, only, with, the, first, voyage, of, the, italian, explorer, christopher, columbus, and, his, crew, to, the, americas, in, 1492, that, the, columbian, exchange, began, resulting, in, major, transformations, in, the, cultures, and, livelihoods, of, the, peoples, in, both, hemispheres, the, first, manifestation, of, the, columbian, exchange, may, have, been, the, spread, of, syphilis, from, the, native, people, of, the, caribbean, sea, to, europe, the, history, of, syphilis, has, been, well, studied, but, the, origin, of, the, disease, remains, a, subject, of, debate, there, are, two, primary, hypotheses, one, proposes, that, syphilis, was, carried, to, europe, from, the, americas, by, the, crew, of, christopher, columbus, in, the, early, 1490s, while, the, other, proposes, that, syphilis, previously, existed, in, europe, but, went, unrecognized, the, first, written, descriptions, of, syphilis, in, the, old, world, came, in, 1493, the, first, large, outbreak, of, syphilis, in, europe, occurred, in, 1494, 1495, among, the, army, of, charles, viii, during, its, invasion, of, naples, many, of, the, crew, members, who, had, served, with, columbus, had, joined, this, army, after, the, victory, charles, s, largely, mercenary, army, returned, to, their, respective, homes, thereby, spreading, the, great, pox, across, europe, and, killing, up, to, five, million, people, the, columbian, exchange, of, diseases, in, the, other, direction, was, by, far, deadlier, the, peoples, of, the, americas, previously, had, no, exposure, to, european, and, african, diseases, and, little, or, no, immunity, an, epidemic, of, swine, influenza, beginning, in, 1493, killed, many, of, the, taino, people, inhabiting, caribbean, islands, the, pre, contact, population, of, the, island, of, hispaniola, was, probably, at, least, 500, 000, but, by, 1526, fewer, than, 500, were, still, alive, spanish, exploitation, was, part, of, the, cause, of, the, near, extinction, of, the, native, people, in, 1518, smallpox, was, first, recorded, in, the, americas, and, became, the, deadliest, imported, old, world, disease, forty, percent, of, the, 200, 000, people, living, in, the, aztec, capital, of, tenochtitlan, later, mexico, city, are, estimated, to, have, died, of, smallpox, in, 1520, during, the, war, of, the, aztecs, with, conquistador, hern, n, cort, s, epidemics, possibly, of, smallpox, and, spread, from, central, america, devastated, the, population, of, the, inca, empire, a, few, years, before, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, the, ravages, of, old, world, diseases, and, spanish, exploitation, reduced, the, mexican, population, from, an, estimated, 20, million, to, barely, more, than, a, million, in, the, 16th, century, the, indigenous, population, of, peru, decreased, from, about, 9, million, in, the, pre, columbian, era, to, 600, 000, in, 1620, an, estimated, 80, 95, percent, of, the, native, american, population, died, in, epidemics, within, the, first, 100, 150, years, following, 1492, nunn, and, qian, also, refer, to, the, calculations, of, the, scientist, david, cook, in, which, in, some, cases, no, one, survived, due, to, diseases, the, deadliest, old, world, diseases, in, the, americas, were, smallpox, measles, whooping, cough, chicken, pox, bubonic, plague, typhus, and, malaria, the, atlantic, slave, trade, consisted, of, the, involuntary, immigration, of, 11, 7, million, africans, primarily, from, west, africa, to, the, americas, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, far, outnumbering, the, about, 3, 4, million, europeans, who, migrated, most, voluntarily, to, the, new, world, between, 1492, and, 1840, the, prevalence, of, african, slaves, in, the, new, world, was, related, to, the, demographic, decline, of, new, world, peoples, and, the, need, of, european, colonists, for, labor, another, reason, for, the, demand, for, slaves, was, the, cultivation, of, special, crops, for, example, sugar, cane, which, were, suitable, for, the, climatic, conditions, of, the, new, lands, and, were, very, popular, the, africans, had, greater, immunities, to, old, world, diseases, than, the, new, world, peoples, and, were, less, likely, to, die, from, disease, the, journey, of, enslaved, africans, from, africa, to, america, is, commonly, known, as, the, middle, passage, enslaved, africans, helped, shape, an, emerging, african, american, culture, in, the, new, world, they, participated, in, both, skilled, and, unskilled, labor, for, example, according, to, the, work, of, james, l, watson, slaves, were, involved, in, handicraft, production, they, could, also, work, as, ordinary, workers, and, as, managers, of, small, enterprises, in, the, commercial, or, industrial, sphere, their, descendants, gradually, developed, an, ethnicity, that, drew, from, the, numerous, african, tribes, as, well, as, european, nationalities, the, descendants, of, african, slaves, make, up, a, majority, of, the, population, in, some, caribbean, countries, notably, haiti, and, jamaica, and, a, sizeable, minority, in, most, american, countries, according, to, the, scholar, jean, macgregor, in, the, new, world, there, was, denial, and, rebellion, against, slavery, the, rebels, went, into, the, rainforests, fought, the, colonizers, refusing, to, stop, until, the, signing, of, agreements, or, gathered, in, settlements, conscious, preservation, of, ethnic, characteristics, was, considered, an, unspoken, manifestation, of, resistance, this, applied, to, both, men, and, women, but, women, had, a, greater, influence, on, the, transmission, of, ethnic, culture, to, future, generations, as, they, were, engaged, in, the, upbringing, of, children, a, movement, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, known, as, abolitionism, developed, in, europe, and, the, americas, during, the, 18th, century, the, efforts, of, abolitionists, eventually, led, to, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, british, empire, in, 1833, the, united, states, in, 1865, and, brazil, in, 1888, the, new, world, produced, 80, percent, or, more, of, the, world, s, silver, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, most, of, it, at, potos, in, bolivia, but, also, in, mexico, the, founding, of, the, city, of, manila, in, the, philippines, in, 1571, for, the, purpose, of, facilitating, trade, in, new, world, silver, with, china, for, silk, porcelain, and, other, luxury, products, has, been, called, by, scholars, the, origin, of, world, trade, china, was, the, world, s, largest, economy, and, in, the, 1570s, adopted, silver, which, china, did, not, produce, in, any, quantity, as, its, medium, of, exchange, china, had, little, interest, in, buying, foreign, products, so, trade, consisted, of, large, quantities, of, silver, coming, into, china, to, pay, for, the, chinese, products, that, foreign, countries, desired, silver, made, it, to, manila, either, through, europe, and, by, ship, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, or, across, the, pacific, ocean, in, spanish, galleons, from, the, mexican, port, of, acapulco, from, manila, the, silver, was, transported, onward, to, china, on, portuguese, and, later, dutch, ships, silver, was, also, smuggled, from, potosi, to, buenos, aires, argentina, to, pay, slavers, for, african, slaves, imported, into, the, new, world, the, enormous, quantities, of, silver, imported, into, spain, and, china, created, vast, wealth, but, also, caused, inflation, and, the, value, of, silver, to, decline, in, 16th, century, china, six, ounces, of, silver, was, equal, to, the, value, of, one, ounce, of, gold, in, 1635, it, took, 13, ounces, of, silver, to, equal, in, value, one, ounce, of, gold, taxes, in, both, countries, were, assessed, on, the, weight, of, silver, not, its, value, the, shortage, of, revenue, due, to, the, decline, in, the, value, of, silver, may, have, contributed, indirectly, to, the, fall, of, the, ming, dynasty, in, 1644, silver, from, the, americas, financed, spain, s, attempt, to, conquer, other, countries, in, europe, the, decline, in, the, value, of, silver, left, spain, faltering, in, the, maintenance, of, its, world, wide, empire, and, retreating, from, its, aggressive, policies, in, europe, after, 1650, because, of, the, new, trading, resulting, from, the, columbian, exchange, several, plants, native, to, the, americas, have, since, spread, around, the, world, including, potatoes, maize, tomatoes, and, tobacco, before, 1500, potatoes, were, not, grown, outside, of, south, america, by, the, 18th, century, they, were, cultivated, and, consumed, widely, in, europe, and, had, become, important, crops, in, both, india, and, north, america, a, highly, caloric, crop, potatoes, eventually, became, an, important, staple, food, in, the, diets, of, many, europeans, contributing, to, an, estimated, 12, to, 25, of, the, population, growth, in, afro, eurasia, between, 1700, and, 1900, many, european, rulers, including, frederick, the, great, of, prussia, and, catherine, the, great, of, russia, encouraged, the, cultivation, of, the, potato, despite, their, lack, of, some, essential, nutrients, such, as, vitamins, d, and, a, potatoes, came, to, satisfy, major, portions, of, the, nutritional, needs, of, people, around, the, world, according, to, one, study, the, introduction, of, potatoes, to, the, old, world, accounts, for, 47, percent, of, the, increase, in, urbanization, between, 1700, and, 1900, maize, and, cassava, were, introduced, from, south, america, by, the, portuguese, in, the, 16th, century, and, gradually, replaced, sorghum, and, millet, as, africa, s, most, important, food, crops, spanish, colonizers, of, the, 16th, century, introduced, new, staple, crops, to, asia, from, the, americas, including, maize, and, sweet, potatoes, and, thereby, contributed, to, population, growth, in, asia, on, a, larger, scale, the, introduction, of, potatoes, and, maize, to, the, old, world, resulted, in, caloric, and, nutritional, improvements, over, previously, existing, staples, throughout, the, eurasian, landmass, enabling, more, varied, and, abundant, food, production, cassava, was, in, greater, demand, in, the, old, world, than, maize, these, crops, also, have, negative, consequences, when, overused, for, example, the, nutritional, diseases, pellagra, and, konzo, but, this, has, not, diminished, the, importance, of, maize, and, cassava, to, human, nutrition, tomatoes, which, came, to, europe, from, the, new, world, via, spain, were, initially, prized, in, italy, mainly, for, their, ornamental, value, starting, in, the, 19th, century, tomato, sauces, became, typical, of, neapolitan, cuisine, and, ultimately, italian, cuisine, in, general, the, discovery, of, the, americas, brought, the, old, world, not, only, many, previously, unknown, plant, species, but, also, new, arable, landscapes, with, favorable, soils, for, growing, highly, valued, old, world, crops, such, as, sugarcane, and, coffee, sugar, had, long, been, important, to, old, world, populations, and, found, even, greater, importance, when, cultivated, in, the, new, world, as, it, is, high, calorie, and, inexpensive, it, was, actively, used, in, cooking, and, is, thought, to, have, increased, the, well, being, of, its, consumers, coffee, introduced, in, the, americas, circa, 1720, from, africa, and, the, middle, east, and, sugarcane, introduced, from, the, indian, subcontinent, to, the, spanish, west, indies, subsequently, became, the, primary, commodity, crops, and, exported, goods, of, extensive, latin, american, plantations, introduced, to, india, by, the, portuguese, chili, peppers, and, potatoes, from, south, america, in, turn, became, integral, parts, of, indian, cuisine, the, discovery, and, spread, of, chili, peppers, in, particular, contributed, to, the, creation, of, many, well, known, dishes, and, spices, which, are, now, intimately, identified, with, old, world, locales, including, korean, kimchi, indian, curry, and, hungarian, paprika, because, crops, traveled, widely, but, at, least, initially, their, endemic, fungi, did, not, for, a, limited, time, yields, were, somewhat, higher, in, the, new, regions, to, which, they, were, introduced, due, to, a, form, of, ecological, release, dark, gent, 2001, termed, this, the, yield, honeymoon, however, as, globalization, has, continued, the, exchange, of, pathogens, has, also, continued, and, crops, have, declined, back, toward, their, endemic, yields, nunn, and, qian, mention, chocolate, and, vanilla, in, their, work, the, spanish, were, the, first, europeans, to, grow, cacao, in, 1590, though, cacao, was, usually, consumed, by, european, populations, in, the, form, of, sweets, and, was, at, first, treated, as, an, expensive, luxury, item, it, helped, to, cope, with, fatigue, and, add, strength, and, energy, as, for, vanilla, the, pods, of, the, plant, after, chemical, treatment, acquired, an, aroma, which, was, then, used, both, in, cooking, and, in, perfumery, rice, was, another, crop, that, became, widely, cultivated, during, the, columbian, exchange, as, the, demand, in, the, new, world, grew, so, did, the, knowledge, of, how, to, cultivate, it, the, two, primary, species, used, were, oryza, glaberrima, and, oryza, sativa, originating, from, west, africa, and, southeast, asia, respectively, european, planters, in, the, new, world, relied, upon, the, skills, of, african, slaves, to, cultivate, both, species, georgia, south, carolina, cuba, and, puerto, rico, were, major, centers, of, rice, production, during, the, colonial, era, enslaved, africans, brought, their, knowledge, of, water, control, milling, winnowing, and, other, agrarian, practices, to, the, fields, this, widespread, knowledge, among, african, slaves, eventually, led, to, rice, becoming, a, staple, food, in, the, new, world, citrus, fruits, and, grapes, were, brought, to, the, americas, from, the, mediterranean, at, first, planters, struggled, to, adapt, these, crops, to, new, world, climates, but, by, the, late, 19th, century, they, were, cultivated, more, consistently, bananas, were, introduced, into, the, americas, in, the, 16th, century, by, portuguese, sailors, who, came, across, the, fruits, in, west, africa, while, engaged, in, commercial, ventures, and, the, slave, trade, despite, this, early, introduction, they, were, consumed, in, minimal, amounts, in, the, americas, as, late, as, the, 1880s, the, u, s, did, not, see, major, increases, in, banana, consumption, until, large, plantations, were, established, in, the, caribbean, the, manila, galleon, trading, network, introduced, american, plants, such, as, chayote, and, papaya, into, southeast, asia, these, were, incorporated, into, the, cuisines, there, it, took, three, centuries, after, their, introduction, in, europe, for, tomatoes, to, become, a, widely, accepted, food, item, nunn, qian, claim, that, according, to, experts, long, before, the, arrival, of, the, spaniards, wild, tomatoes, came, from, central, america, to, south, america, thereby, initiating, the, cultivation, of, tomatoes, in, different, parts, of, the, americas, tobacco, potatoes, chili, peppers, tomatillos, and, tomatoes, are, all, members, of, the, nightshade, family, similar, to, some, european, nightshade, varieties, tomatoes, and, potatoes, can, be, harmful, or, even, lethal, if, the, wrong, part, of, the, plant, is, consumed, in, excess, physicians, in, the, 16th, century, had, good, reason, to, suspect, that, this, native, mexican, fruit, was, poisonous, they, suspected, it, of, generating, melancholic, humours, in, 1544, pietro, andrea, mattioli, a, tuscan, physician, and, botanist, suggested, that, tomatoes, might, be, edible, but, no, record, exists, of, anyone, consuming, them, at, this, time, in, 1592, the, head, gardener, at, the, botanical, garden, of, aranjuez, near, madrid, under, the, patronage, of, philip, ii, of, spain, wrote, it, is, said, are, good, for, sauces, in, spite, of, these, comments, tomatoes, remained, exotic, plants, grown, for, ornamental, purposes, but, rarely, for, culinary, use, on, october, 31, 1548, the, tomato, was, given, its, first, name, anywhere, in, europe, when, a, house, steward, of, cosimo, i, de, medici, duke, of, florence, wrote, to, the, medici, s, private, secretary, that, the, basket, of, pomi, d, oro, had, arrived, safely, at, this, time, the, label, pomi, d, oro, was, also, used, to, refer, to, figs, melons, and, citrus, fruits, in, treatises, by, scientists, in, the, early, years, tomatoes, were, mainly, grown, as, ornamentals, in, italy, for, example, the, florentine, aristocrat, giovan, vettorio, soderini, wrote, that, they, were, to, be, sought, only, for, their, beauty, and, were, grown, only, in, gardens, or, flower, beds, tomatoes, were, grown, in, elite, town, and, country, gardens, in, the, fifty, years, or, so, following, their, arrival, in, europe, and, were, only, occasionally, depicted, in, works, of, art, tomatoes, are, very, useful, as, they, contain, significant, amounts, of, the, essential, vitamins, c, and, a, even, despite, the, small, number, of, calories, they, provide, tomatoes, have, become, regular, contributors, to, the, diets, of, western, consumers, the, first, italian, cookbook, to, include, tomato, sauce, lo, scalco, alla, moderna, the, modern, steward, was, written, by, italian, chef, antonio, latini, and, was, published, in, two, volumes, in, 1692, and, 1694, in, 1790, the, use, of, tomato, sauce, with, pasta, appeared, for, the, first, time, in, the, italian, cookbook, l, apicio, moderno, the, modern, apicius, by, chef, francesco, leonardi, today, around, 32, 000, acres, 13, 000, ha, of, tomatoes, are, cultivated, in, italy, the, most, problematic, thing, about, eating, tomatoes, was, their, storage, conditions, in, hot, weather, tomatoes, deteriorated, in, just, a, few, days, canning, solved, this, problem, by, allowing, the, product, to, be, stored, for, months, although, canning, was, expensive, in, the, beginning, after, the, introduction, of, mechanical, labor, tomatoes, became, available, to, everyone, canned, tomatoes, contain, a, useful, antioxidant, lycopene, which, reduces, the, risk, of, developing, serious, diseases, initially, the, columbian, exchange, of, animals, largely, went, in, one, direction, from, europe, to, the, new, world, as, the, eurasian, regions, had, domesticated, many, more, animals, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, large, dogs, cats, and, bees, were, rapidly, adopted, by, native, peoples, for, transport, food, and, other, uses, one, of, the, first, european, exports, to, the, americas, the, horse, changed, the, lives, of, many, native, american, tribes, the, mountain, tribes, shifted, to, a, nomadic, lifestyle, based, on, hunting, bison, on, horseback, they, largely, gave, up, settled, agriculture, horse, culture, was, adopted, gradually, by, great, plains, indians, the, existing, plains, tribes, expanded, their, territories, with, horses, and, the, animals, were, considered, so, valuable, that, horse, herds, became, a, measure, of, wealth, this, transfer, reintroduced, horses, to, the, americas, as, the, species, had, died, out, there, prior, to, the, development, of, the, modern, horse, in, eurasia, while, mesoamerican, peoples, mayas, in, particular, already, practiced, apiculture, producing, wax, and, honey, from, a, variety, of, bees, such, as, melipona, or, trigona, european, bees, apis, mellifera, were, more, productive, delivering, a, honey, with, less, water, content, and, allowing, for, an, easier, extraction, from, beehives, were, introduced, in, new, spain, becoming, an, important, part, of, farming, production, the, effects, of, the, introduction, of, european, livestock, on, the, environments, and, peoples, of, the, new, world, were, not, always, positive, in, the, caribbean, the, proliferation, of, european, animals, consumed, native, fauna, and, undergrowth, changing, habitat, if, free, ranging, the, animals, often, damaged, conucos, plots, managed, by, indigenous, peoples, for, subsistence, the, mapuche, of, araucan, a, were, fast, to, adopt, the, horse, from, the, spanish, and, improve, their, military, capabilities, as, they, fought, the, arauco, war, against, spanish, colonizers, until, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, the, mapuches, had, largely, maintained, chilihueques, llamas, as, livestock, the, spanish, introduction, of, sheep, caused, some, competition, between, the, two, domesticated, species, anecdotal, evidence, of, the, mid, 17th, century, show, that, by, then, both, species, coexisted, but, that, the, sheep, far, outnumbered, the, llamas, the, decline, of, llamas, reached, a, point, in, the, late, 18th, century, when, only, the, mapuche, from, mariquina, and, the, huequ, n, next, to, angol, raised, llamas, in, the, chilo, archipelago, the, introduction, of, pigs, by, the, spanish, proved, a, success, they, could, feed, on, the, abundant, shellfish, and, algae, exposed, by, the, large, tides, in, the, other, direction, the, turkey, guinea, pig, and, the, muscovy, duck, were, new, world, animals, that, were, transferred, to, europe, european, exploration, of, tropical, areas, was, aided, by, the, new, world, discovery, of, quinine, the, first, effective, treatment, for, malaria, cinchona, trees, from, the, andes, were, processed, and, quinine, was, obtained, from, their, bark, europeans, suffered, from, this, disease, but, some, indigenous, populations, had, developed, at, least, partial, resistance, to, it, in, africa, resistance, to, malaria, has, been, associated, with, other, genetic, changes, among, sub, saharan, africans, and, their, descendants, which, can, cause, sickle, cell, disease, the, resistance, of, sub, saharan, africans, to, malaria, in, the, southern, united, states, and, the, caribbean, contributed, greatly, to, the, specific, character, of, the, africa, sourced, slavery, in, those, regions, similarly, yellow, fever, is, thought, to, have, been, brought, to, the, americas, from, africa, via, the, atlantic, slave, trade, because, it, was, endemic, in, africa, many, people, there, had, acquired, immunity, europeans, suffered, higher, rates, of, death, than, did, african, descended, persons, when, exposed, to, yellow, fever, in, africa, and, the, americas, where, numerous, epidemics, swept, the, colonies, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, and, continuing, into, the, late, 19th, century, the, disease, caused, widespread, fatalities, in, the, caribbean, during, the, heyday, of, slave, based, sugar, plantation, the, replacement, of, native, forests, by, sugar, plantations, and, factories, facilitated, its, spread, in, the, tropical, area, by, reducing, the, number, of, potential, natural, mosquito, predators, the, means, of, yellow, fever, transmission, was, unknown, until, 1881, when, carlos, finlay, suggested, that, the, disease, was, transmitted, through, mosquitoes, now, known, to, be, female, mosquitoes, of, the, species, aedes, aegypti, one, of, the, results, of, the, movement, of, people, between, new, and, old, worlds, were, cultural, exchanges, for, example, in, the, article, the, myth, of, early, globalization, the, atlantic, economy, 1500, 1800, pieter, emmer, makes, the, point, that, from, 1500, onward, a, clash, of, cultures, had, begun, in, the, atlantic, this, clash, of, culture, involved, the, transfer, of, european, values, to, indigenous, cultures, as, an, example, the, emergence, of, the, concept, of, private, property, in, regions, where, property, was, often, viewed, as, communal, concepts, of, monogamy, although, many, indigenous, peoples, were, already, monogamous, the, role, of, women, and, children, in, the, social, system, and, different, concepts, of, labor, including, slavery, although, slavery, was, already, a, practice, among, many, indigenous, peoples, and, was, widely, practiced, or, introduced, by, europeans, into, the, americas, another, example, included, the, european, abhorrence, of, human, sacrifice, a, religious, practice, among, some, indigenous, populations, during, the, initial, stages, of, european, colonization, of, the, americas, europeans, encountered, fence, less, lands, they, believed, that, the, land, was, unimproved, and, available, for, their, taking, as, they, sought, economic, opportunity, and, homesteads, however, when, european, settlers, arrived, in, virginia, they, encountered, a, fully, established, indigenous, people, the, powhatan, the, powhatan, farmers, in, virginia, scattered, their, farm, plots, within, larger, cleared, areas, these, larger, cleared, areas, were, a, communal, place, for, growing, useful, plants, as, the, europeans, viewed, fences, as, hallmarks, of, civilization, they, set, about, transforming, the, land, into, something, more, suitable, for, themselves, tobacco, was, a, new, world, agricultural, product, originally, a, luxury, good, spread, as, part, of, the, columbian, exchange, as, is, discussed, in, regard, to, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, the, tobacco, trade, increased, demand, for, free, labor, and, spread, tobacco, worldwide, in, discussing, the, widespread, uses, of, tobacco, the, spanish, physician, nicolas, monardes, 1493, 1588, noted, that, the, black, people, that, have, gone, from, these, parts, to, the, indies, have, taken, up, the, same, manner, and, use, of, tobacco, that, the, indians, have, tobacco, was, used, in, the, old, world, as, medicine, and, currency, in, the, new, world, it, was, the, subject, of, religious, customs, one, of, the, most, clearly, notable, areas, of, cultural, clash, and, exchange, was, that, of, religion, often, the, lead, point, of, cultural, conversion, in, the, spanish, and, portuguese, dominions, the, spread, of, catholicism, steeped, in, a, european, values, system, was, a, major, objective, of, colonization, europeans, often, pursued, it, via, explicit, policies, of, suppression, of, indigenous, languages, cultures, and, religions, in, british, america, protestant, missionaries, converted, many, members, of, indigenous, tribes, to, protestantism, the, french, colonies, had, a, more, outright, religious, mandate, as, some, of, the, early, explorers, such, as, jacques, marquette, were, also, catholic, priests, in, time, and, given, the, european, technological, and, immunological, superiority, which, aided, and, secured, their, dominance, indigenous, religions, declined, in, the, centuries, following, the, european, settlement, of, the, americas, while, the, mapuche, of, araucania, adopted, the, horse, sheep, and, wheat, the, over, all, scant, adoption, of, spanish, technology, and, adherence, to, ancestral, customs, by, mapuche, was, a, means, of, cultural, resistance, according, to, caroline, dodds, pennock, in, atlantic, history, indigenous, people, are, often, seen, as, static, recipients, of, transatlantic, encounters, but, thousands, of, native, americans, crossed, the, ocean, during, the, sixteenth, century, some, by, choice, plants, that, arrived, by, land, sea, or, air, in, the, times, before, 1492, are, called, archaeophytes, and, plants, introduced, to, europe, after, those, times, are, called, neophytes, invasive, species, of, plants, and, pathogens, also, were, introduced, by, chance, including, such, weeds, as, tumbleweeds, salsola, spp, and, wild, oats, avena, fatua, some, plants, introduced, intentionally, such, as, the, kudzu, vine, introduced, in, 1894, from, japan, to, the, united, states, to, help, control, soil, erosion, have, since, been, found, to, be, invasive, pests, in, the, new, environment, fungi, have, been, transported, such, as, the, one, responsible, for, dutch, elm, disease, killing, american, elms, in, north, american, forests, and, cities, where, many, had, been, planted, as, street, trees, some, of, the, invasive, species, have, become, serious, ecosystem, and, economic, problems, after, establishing, in, the, new, world, environments, a, beneficial, although, probably, unintentional, introduction, is, saccharomyces, eubayanus, the, yeast, responsible, for, lager, beer, now, thought, to, have, originated, in, patagonia, others, have, crossed, the, atlantic, to, europe, and, have, changed, the, course, of, history, in, the, 1840s, phytophthora, infestans, crossed, the, oceans, damaging, the, potato, crop, in, several, european, nations, in, ireland, the, potato, crop, was, totally, destroyed, the, great, famine, of, ireland, caused, millions, to, starve, to, death, or, emigrate, many, animals, were, introduced, to, new, habitats, on, the, other, side, of, the, world, either, accidentally, or, incidentally, these, include, such, animals, as, brown, rats, and, zebra, mussels, which, arrived, on, ships, escaped, and, feral, populations, of, non, indigenous, animals, have, thrived, in, both, the, old, and, new, worlds, often, negatively, impacting, or, displacing, native, species, in, the, new, world, populations, of, feral, european, cats, pigs, horses, and, cattle, are, common, and, the, burmese, python, and, green, iguana, are, considered, problematic, in, florida, in, the, old, world, the, eastern, gray, squirrel, has, been, particularly, successful, in, colonising, great, britain, and, populations, of, raccoons, can, now, be, found, in, some, regions, of, germany, the, caucasus, and, japan, fur, farm, escapees, such, as, coypu, and, american, mink, have, extensive, populations
