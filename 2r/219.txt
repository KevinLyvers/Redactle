of, the, mali, empire, before, the, 13th, century, is, unclear, as, there, are, conflicting, and, imprecise, accounts, by, both, arab, chroniclers, and, oral, traditionalists, the, first, ruler, for, which, there, is, accurate, written, information, is, sundiata, keita, a, warrior, prince, of, the, keita, dynasty, who, was, called, upon, to, free, the, local, people, from, the, rule, of, the,

expenditure, of, gold, caused, significant, inflation, in, egypt, maghan, i, succeeded, him, as, mansa, in, 1337, but, was, deposed, by, his, uncle, suleyman, in, 1341, it, was, during, suleyman, s, 19, year, reign, that, ibn, battuta, visited, mali, suleyman, s, death, marked, the, end, of, mali, s, golden, age, and, the, beginning, of, a, slow, decline, the, tarikh, al, sudan, records, that, mali, was, still, a, sizeable, state, in, the, 15th, century, at, that, time, the, venetian, explorer, alvise, cadamosto, and, portuguese, traders, confirmed, that, the, peoples, who, settled, within, gambia, river, were, still, subject, to, the, mansa, of, mali, upon, leo, africanus, s, visit, at, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, his, descriptions, of, the, territorial, domains, of, mali, showed, that, it, was, still, a, kingdom, of, considerable, size, however, from, 1507, onwards, neighboring, states, such, as, diarra, great, fulo, and, the, songhai, empire, chipped, away, at, mali, s, borders, in, 1542, the, songhai, invaded, the, capital, but, were, unsuccessful, in, conquering, the, empire, during, the, 17th, century, the, mali, empire, faced, incursions, from, the, bamana, empire, who, ultimately, sacked, and, burned, the, capital, in, 1670, the, mali, empire, rapidly, disintegrated, being, replaced, by, independent, chiefdoms, the, keitas, retreated, to, the, town, of, kangaba, where, they, became, provincial, chiefs, much, of, the, recorded, information, about, the, mali, empire, comes, from, 14th, century, tunisian, historian, ibn, khaldun, 14th, century, moroccan, traveller, ibn, battuta, and, 16th, century, andalusian, traveller, leo, africanus, the, other, major, source, of, information, comes, from, mandinka, oral, tradition, as, recorded, by, storytellers, known, as, griots, imperial, mali, is, also, known, through, the, account, of, shihab, al, umari, written, in, about, 1340, by, a, geographer, administrator, in, mamluk, egypt, his, information, about, the, empire, came, from, visiting, malians, taking, the, hajj, or, pilgrim, s, voyage, to, mecca, he, had, first, hand, information, from, several, sources, and, from, a, second, hand, source, he, learned, of, the, visit, of, mansa, musa, the, traveller, ibn, battuta, who, visited, mali, in, 1352, left, the, first, account, of, a, west, african, kingdom, made, directly, by, an, eyewitness, the, others, are, usually, second, hand, the, third, great, account, is, that, of, ibn, khaldun, who, wrote, in, the, early, 15th, century, while, the, accounts, are, of, limited, length, they, provide, a, fairly, good, picture, of, the, empire, at, its, height, after, ibn, khaldun, s, death, in, 1406, there, are, no, further, arab, primary, sources, except, for, leo, africanus, who, wrote, more, than, a, century, later, arab, interest, in, the, mali, empire, declined, after, the, songhai, conquered, the, northern, regions, of, the, empire, which, formed, the, primary, contact, between, mali, and, the, arab, world, for, the, later, period, of, the, mali, empire, the, major, written, primary, sources, are, portuguese, accounts, of, the, coastal, provinces, of, mali, and, neighboring, societies, mali, mand, manden, and, manding, are, all, various, pronunciations, of, the, same, word, across, different, languages, and, dialects, the, version, recorded, by, medieval, arab, geographers, is, mali, arabic, romanized, m, l, mali, is, the, fula, form, of, the, word, in, the, manding, languages, the, modern, descendants, of, the, language, spoken, at, the, core, of, the, mali, empire, manden, or, manding, is, the, name, of, the, region, corresponding, to, the, heartland, of, the, mali, empire, medieval, sources, are, divided, over, whether, mali, is, the, name, of, a, town, or, a, region, ibn, battuta, who, visited, the, capital, city, from, 1352, to, 1353, called, it, mali, the, 1375, catalan, atlas, portrayed, a, city, of, melly, catalan, ciutat, de, melly, in, west, africa, leo, africanus, said, that, the, capital, city, was, called, melli, however, ibn, fadlallah, al, umari, gives, mali, as, the, name, of, the, capital, province, and, ibn, khaldun, refers, to, mali, as, a, people, with, each, giving, different, names, for, the, capital, city, itself, whether, mali, originated, as, the, name, of, a, town, or, region, the, name, was, subsequently, applied, to, the, entire, empire, ruled, from, mali, another, hypothesis, suggests, that, the, name, mali, is, derived, from, mand, mali, hippopotamus, an, animal, that, had, special, significance, to, the, keitas, and, that, mand, means, little, manatee, a, legend, claims, that, sunjata, transformed, into, a, hippopotamus, however, these, hypotheses, have, been, rejected, by, locals, and, are, inconsistent, with, the, apparent, cognate, status, of, mali, and, mand, in, the, first, millennium, bc, early, cities, and, towns, were, founded, along, the, middle, niger, river, including, at, dia, which, reached, its, peak, around, 600, bc, and, djenne, djenno, which, lasted, from, around, 250, bc, to, 900, ad, by, the, 6th, century, ad, the, lucrative, trans,

even, the, ghana, empire, in, its, apex, when, the, campaigning, was, done, his, empire, extended, 1, 000, miles, 1, 600, km, east, to, west, with, those, borders, being, the, bends, of, the, senegal,

s, death, the, jomba, or, court, slaves, may, have, held, power, some, oral, traditions, agree, with, ibn, khaldun, in, indicating, that, a, son, of, sunjata, named, yerelinkon, in, oral, tradition, and, wali, in, arabic, took, power, as, sunjata, s, successor, ibn, khaldun, regarded, wali, as, one, of, mali, s, greatest, rulers, he, went, on, the, hajj, during, the, reign, of, mamluk, sultan, baibars, 1260, 1277, wali, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, wati, about, whom, nothing, is, known, and, then, his, brother, khalifa, khalifa, would, shoot, arrows, at, his, subjects, so, he, was, overthrown, and, killed, he, was, replaced, by, abu, bakr, a, son, of, sunjata, s, daughter, abu, bakr, was, the, first, and, only, mansa, to, inherit, through, the, female, line, which, has, been, argued, to, be, either, a, break, from, or, a, return, to, tradition, then, an, enslaved, court, official, sakura, seized, power, sakura, was, able, to, stabilize, the, political, situation, in, mali, under, his, leadership, mali, conquered, new, territories, and, trade, with, north, africa, increased, he, went, on, the, hajj, during, the, reign, of, mamluk, sultan, an, nasir, muhammad, 1298, 1308, and, was, killed, in, tajura, on, his, way, back, to, mali, after, sakura, s, death, power, returned, to, the, line, of, sunjata, with, wali, s, son, qu, taking, the, throne, qu, was, succeeded, by, his, son, muhammad, who, launched, two, voyages, to, explore, the, atlantic, ocean, after, the, loss, of, the, first, expedition, muhammad, led, the, second, expedition, himself, he, left, kanku, musa, a, grandson, of, sunjata, s, brother, mande, bori, in, charge, during, his, absence, eventually, due, to, muhammad, s, failure, to, return, musa, was, recognized, as, mansa, kankan, musa, better, known, as, mansa, musa, probably, took, power, in, approximately, 1312, although, an, earlier, date, is, possible, his, reign, is, considered, the, golden, age, of, mali, he, was, one, of, the, first, truly, devout, muslims, to, lead, the, mali, empire, he, attempted, to, make, islam, the, faith, of, the, nobility, but, kept, to, the, imperial, tradition, of, not, forcing, it, on, the, populace, he, also, made, eid, celebrations, at, the, end, of, ramadan, a, national, ceremony, he, could, read, and, write, arabic, and, took, an, interest, in, the, scholarly, city, of, timbuktu, which, he, peaceably, annexed, in, 1324, via, one, of, the, royal, ladies, of, his, court, musa, transformed, sankore, from, an, informal, madrasah, into, an, islamic, university, islamic, studies, flourished, thereafter, mansa, musa, keita, s, crowning, achievement, was, his, famous, pilgrimage, to, mecca, which, started, in, 1324, and, concluded, with, his, return, in, 1326, accounts, of, how, many, people, and, how, much, gold, he, spent, vary, all, of, them, agree, that, he, took, a, very, large, group, of, people, the, mansa, kept, a, personal, guard, of, some, 500, men, and, he, gave, out, so, many, alms, and, bought, so, many, things, that, the, value, of, gold, in, egypt, and, arabia, depreciated, for, twelve, years, when, he, passed, through, cairo, historian, al, maqrizi, noted, the, members, of, his, entourage, proceeded, to, buy, turkish, and, ethiopian, slave, girls, singing, girls, and, garments, so, that, the, rate, of, the, gold, dinar, fell, by, six, dirhams, another, testimony, from, ibn, khaldun, describes, the, grand, pilgrimage, of, mansa, musa, consisting, of, 12, 000, slaves, he, made, a, pilgrimage, in, 724, 1324, at, each, halt, he, would, regale, us, rare, foods, and, confectionery, his, equipment, furnishings, were, carried, by, 12, 000, private, slave, women, wasaif, wearing, gown, and, brocade, dibaj, and, yemeni, silk, mansa, musa, came, from, his, country, with, 80, loads, of, gold, dust, tibr, each, load, weighing, three, qintars, in, their, own, country, they, use, only, slave, women, and, men, for, transport, but, for, long, journeys, such, as, pilgrimages, they, have, mounts, contemporary, sources, suggest, that, the, mounts, employed, by, this, caravan, were, one, hundred, elephants, which, carried, those, loads, of, gold, and, several, hundred, camels, carrying, the, food, supplies, and, weaponries, which, were, brought, to, the, rear, musa, took, out, large, loans, from, money, lenders, in, cairo, before, beginning, his, journey, home, it, is, not, known, if, this, was, an, attempt, to, correct, the, depreciation, of, gold, in, the, area, due, to, his, spending, or, if, he, had, simply, run, out, of, the, funds, needed, for, the, return, trip, musa, s, hajj, and, especially, his, gold, caught, the, attention, of, both, the, islamic, and, christian, worlds, consequently, the, name, of, mali, and, timbuktu, appeared, on, 14th, century, world, maps, while, on, the, hajj, he, met, the, andalusian, poet, and, architect, es, saheli, mansa, musa, brought, the, architect, back, to, mali, to, beautify, some, of, the, cities, but, more, reasoned, analysis, suggests, that, his, role, if, any, was, quite, limited, the, architectural, crafts, in, granada, had, reached, their, zenith, by, the, fourteenth, century, and, its, extremely, unlikely, that, a, cultured, and, wealthy, poet, would, have, had, anything, more, than, a, dilettante, s, knowledge, of, the, intricacies, of, contemporary, architectural, practice, mosques, were, built, in, gao, and, timbuktu, along, with, impressive, palaces, also, built, in, timbuktu, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1337, mali, had, control, over, taghazza, a, salt, producing, area, in, the, north, which, further, strengthened, its, treasury, that, same, year, after, the, mandinka, general, known, as, sagmandir, put, down, yet, another, rebellion, in, gao, mansa, musa, came, to, gao, and, accepted, the, capitulation, of, the, king, of, ghana, and, his, nobles, by, the, end, of, mansa, musa, s, reign, the, sankor, university, had, been, converted, into, a, fully, staffed, university, with, the, largest, collections, of, books, in, africa, since, the, library, of, alexandria, the, sankor, university, was, capable, of, housing, 25, 000, students, and, had, one, of, the, largest, libraries, in, the, world, with, roughly, 1, 000, 000, manuscripts, mansa, musa, keita, was, succeeded, by, his, son, maghan, keita, i, in, 1337, mansa, maghan, keita, i, spent, wastefully, and, was, the, first, lacklustre, emperor, since, khalifa, keita, but, the, mali, empire, built, by, his, predecessors, was, too, strong, for, even, his, misrule, and, it, passed, intact, to, musa, s, brother, souleyman, keita, in, 1341, mansa, souleyman, keita, or, suleiman, took, steep, measures, to, put, mali, back, into, financial, shape, thereby, developing, a, reputation, for, miserliness, it, is, during, his, reign, that, fula, raids, on, takrur, began, there, was, also, a, palace, conspiracy, to, overthrow, him, hatched, by, the, qasa, the, manding, term, meaning, queen, kassi, and, several, army, commanders, mansa, souleyman, s, generals, successfully, fought, off, the, military, incursions, and, the, senior, wife, kassi, behind, the, plot, was, imprisoned, the, mansa, also, made, a, successful, hajj, kept, up, correspondence, with, morocco, and, egypt, and, built, an, earthen, platform, at, kangaba, called, the, camanbolon, where, he, held, court, with, provincial, governors, and, deposited, the, holy, books, he, brought, back, from, hedjaz, the, only, major, setback, to, his, reign, was, the, loss, of, mali, s, dyolof, province, in, senegal, the, wolof, populations, of, the, area, united, into, their, own, state, known, as, the, jolof, empire, in, the, 1350s, still, when, ibn, battuta, arrived, at, mali, in, july, 1352, he, found, a, thriving, civilisation, on, par, with, virtually, anything, in, the, muslim, or, christian, world, mansa, souleyman, keita, died, in, 1360, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, camba, keita, after, a, mere, nine, months, of, rule, mansa, camba, keita, was, deposed, by, one, of, maghan, keita, i, s, three, sons, konkodougou, kamissa, keita, named, for, the, province, he, once, governed, was, crowned, as, mansa, mari, djata, keita, ii, in, 1360, he, ruled, oppressively, and, nearly, bankrupted, mali, with, his, lavish, spending, he, did, however, maintain, contacts, with, morocco, sending, a, giraffe, to, king, abu, hassan, mansa, mari, djata, keita, ii, became, seriously, ill, in, 1372, and, power, moved, into, the, hands, of, his, ministers, until, his, death, in, 1374, the, reign, of, mari, djata, keita, ii, was, ruinous, and, left, the, empire, in, bad, financial, shape, but, the, empire, itself, passed, intact, to, the, dead, emperor, s, brother, mansa, fadima, musa, keita, or, mansa, musa, keita, ii, began, the, process, of, reversing, his, brother, s, excesses, he, did, not, however, hold, the, power, of, previous, mansas, because, of, the, influence, of, his, kankoro, sigui, kankoro, sigui, mari, djata, who, had, no, relation, to, the, keita, clan, essentially, ran, the, empire, in, musa, keita, ii, s, stead, ibn, khaldun, recorded, that, in, 776, a, h, or, 1374, 1375, ad, he, interviewed, a, sijilmasan, scholar, named, muhammad, b, wasul, who, had, lived, in, gao, and, had, been, employed, in, its, judiciary, the, latter, told, ibn, khaldun, about, devastating, struggle, over, gao, between, mali, imperial, forces, against, berber, tuareg, forces, from, takedda, the, text, of, ibn, khaldun, says, gao, at, this, time, is, devastated, it, seems, quite, possible, that, an, exodus, of, the, inhabitants, took, place, at, this, juncture, and, the, importance, of, the, city, was, not, revived, until, the, rise, of, the, songhai, empire, the, songhai, settlement, effectively, shook, off, mali, s, authority, in, 1375, still, by, the, time, of, mansa, musa, keita, ii, s, death, in, 1387, mali, was, financially, solvent,

evident, is, that, there, is, no, steady, lineage, governing, the, empire, the, other, characteristic, of, this, era, is, the, gradual, loss, of, its, northern, and, eastern, possessions, to, the,

wrote, down, a, description, of, mali, based, on, information, given, to, him, by, abu, sa, id, otman, ed, dukkali, who, had, lived, 35, years, in, the, capital, reported, the, realm, as, being, square, and, an, eight, month, journey, from, its, coast, at, tura, at, the, mouth, of, the, senegal, river, to, muli, umari, also, describes, the, empire, as, being, south, of, marrakesh, and, almost, entirely, inhabited, except, for, few, places, mali, s, domain, also, extended, into, the, desert, he, describes, it, as, being, north, of, mali, but, under, its, domination, implying, some, sort, of, vassalage, for, the, antasar, yantar, ras, medussa, and, lemtuna, berber, tribes, with, garrisons, kept, at, oualata, timbuktu, koumbi, and, gao, and, responsibility, of, governing, the,

villages, of, various, religions, and, elasticities, during, this, period, only, the, mongol, empire, was, larger, al, umari, reported, that, mali, had, fourteen, provinces, his, list, does, not, necessarily, accurately, reflect, the, actual, organization, of, the, mali, empire, and, the, identification, of, the, listed, provinces, is, controversial, several, of, the, names, are, spelled, in, a, variety, of, ways, in, different, manuscripts, al, umari, s, list, which, is, quoted, with, slight, differences, by, al, qalqashandi, is, as, follows, al, umari, also, indicates, that, four, amazigh, tribes, were, subjects, of, mali, gomez, instead, suggests, that, these, tribes, would, have, inhabited, territory, in, the, vicinity, of, mema, ghana, and, diafunu, the, identity, of, the, capital, city, of, the, mali, empire, is, a, matter, of, dispute, among, historians, scholars, have, located, the, capital, in, niani, or, somewhere, on, the, niger, or, proposed, that, it, changed, several, times, that, there, was, no, true, capital, or, even, that, it, lay, as, far, afield, as, the, upper, gambia, river, in, modern, day, senegal, seemingly, contradictory, reports, written, by, arab, visitors, a, lack, of, definitive, archaeological, evidence, and, the, diversity, of, oral, traditions, all, contribute, to, this, uncertainty, a, particular, challenge, lies, in, interpreting, early, arabic, manuscripts, in, which, without, vowel, markings, and, diacritics, foreign, names, can, be, read, in, numerous, different, ways, e, g, biti, buti, yiti, tati, ibn, battuta, and, leo, africanus, both, call, the, capital, mali, early, european, writers, such, as, maurice, delafosse, believed, that, niani, a, city, on, what, is, now, the, border, between, guinea, and, mali, was, the, capital, for, most, of, the, empire, s, history, and, this, notion, has, taken, hold, in, the, popular, imagination, djibril, tamsir, niane, a, guinean, historian, has, been, a, forceful, advocate, of, this, position, in, recent, decades, the, identification, of, niani, as, imperial, capital, is, rooted, in, an, possibly, erroneous, interpretation, of, the, arab, traveler, al, umari, s, work, as, well, as, some, oral, histories, extensive, archaeological, digs, have, shown, that, the, area, was, an, important, trade, and, manufacturing, center, in, the, 15th, century, but, no, firm, evidence, of, royal, residence, has, come, to, light, niani, s, reputation, as, an, imperial, capital, may, derive, from, its, importance, in, the, late, imperial, period, when, the, songhai, empire, to, the, northeast, pushed, mali, back, to, the, manding, heartland, several, 21st, century, historians, have, firmly, rejected, niani, as, a, capital, candidate, based, on, a, lack, of, archaeological, evidence, of, significant, trade, activity, clearly, described, by, arab, visitors, particularly, during, the, 14th, century, mali, s, golden, age, in, fact, there, is, a, conspicuous, absence, of, archaeological, samples, of, any, kind, from, niani, dated, to, the, late, 13th, through, early, 15th, centuries, suggesting, that, niani, may, have, been, uninhabited, during, the, heyday, of, the, mali, empire, various, sources, cite, several, other, cities, as, capitals, of, the, mali, empire, some, in, competition, with, the, niani, hypothesis, and, others, addressing, different, time, periods, a, city, called, dieriba, or, dioliba, is, sometimes, mentioned, as, the, capital, or, main, urban, center, of, the, province, of, mande, in, the, years, before, sundiata, that, was, later, abandoned, many, oral, histories, point, to, a, town, called, dakajalan, as, the, original, home, of, the, keita, clan, and, sundiata, s, childhood, home, and, base, of, operations, during, the, war, against, the, soso, it, may, have, been, located, close, to, modern, kangaba, mande, bards, in, the, region, speak, of, the, dakajalan, site, containing, sundiata, s, grave, as, sacrosanct, kangaba, became, the, last, refuge, of, the, keita, royal, family, after, the, collapse, of, the, mali, empire, and, so, has, for, centuries, been, associated, with, sundiata, in, the, cultural, imagination, of, mande, peoples, if, dakajalan, was, in, fact, situated, near, kangaba, this, may, also, have, contributed, to, their, conflation, beginning, with, delafosse, s, speculation, that, the, latter, may, have, begun, as, a, suburb, of, the, former, according, to, jules, vidal, and, levtzion, citing, oral, histories, from, kangaba, and, keyla, another, onetime, capital, was, manikoro, or, mali, kura, founded, after, the, destruction, of, niani, parallel, to, this, debate, many, scholars, have, argued, that, the, mali, empire, may, not, have, had, a, permanent, capital, in, the, sense, that, the, word, is, used, today, and, historically, was, used, in, the, mediterranean, world, rather, authority, would, rest, with, the, mansa, and, his, court, wherever, he, went, therefore, arabic, visitors, may, have, assigned, the, capital, label, merely, to, whatever, major, city, the, mansa, was, based, out, of, at, the, time, of, their, visit, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, name, given, in, the, arabic, sources, for, the, capital, of, mali, is, derived, the, manding, word, bambi, meaning, dais, and, as, such, refers, to, the, seat, of, government, in, general, rather, than, being, the, name, of, a, specific, city, such, impermanent, capitals, are, a, historically, widespread, phenomenon, having, occurred, in, other, parts, of, africa, such, as, ethiopia, as, well, as, outside, africa, such, as, in, the, holy, roman, empire, the, majority, of, the, population, were, farmers, with, this, being, the, base, of, the, economy, and, food, was, abundant,

significant, factor, to, the, rise, and, success, of, mali, its, height, coincided, with, the, period, when, timbuktu, came, under, the, mansa, s, control, the, empire, taxed, every, ounce, of, gold, copper, and, salt, that, entered, its, borders, with, kola, nuts, also, bearing, importance, by, the, 14th, century, a, pax, mandinka, reigned, in, west, africa, allowing, trade, to, flourish, there,

towns, during, most, of, his, journey, ibn, battuta, travelled, with, a, retinue, that, included, slaves, most, of, whom, carried, goods, for, trade, on, the, return, from, takedda, to, morocco, his, caravan, transported, 600, female, slaves, suggesting, that, slavery, was, a, substantial, part, of, the, commercial, activity, of, the, empire, mali, s, wealth, in, gold, did, not, primarily, come, from, direct, rule, of, gold, producing, regions, but, rather, from, tribute, and, trade, with, the, regions, where, gold, was, found, gold, nuggets, were, the, exclusive, property, of, the, mansa, and, were, illegal, to, trade, within, his, borders, all, gold, was, immediately, handed, over, to, the, imperial, treasury, in, return, for, an, equal, value, of, gold, dust, gold, dust, had, been, weighed, and, bagged, for, use, at, least, since, the, time, of, the, ghana, empire, mali, borrowed, the, practice, to, stem, inflation, since, it, was, so, prominent, in, the, region, the, most, common, measure, for, gold, within, the, realm, was, the, mithqal, 4, 5, grams, of, gold, this, term, was, used, interchangeably, with, dinar, though, it, is, unclear, if, coined, currency, was, used, in, the, empire, gold, dust, was, used, all, over, the, empire, but, was, not, valued, equally, in, all, regions, by, the, beginning, of, the, 14th, century, mali, was, the, source, of, almost, half, the, old, world, s, gold, exported, from, mines, in, bambuk, boure, and, galam, gold, mines, in, boure, which, is, located, in, present, day, guinea, were, discovered, sometime, near, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, salt, another, critical, trade, good, was, as, valuable, if, not, more, valuable, than, gold, in, sub, saharan, africa, it, was, cut, into, pieces, and, spent, on, goods, with, close, to, equal, buying, power, throughout, the, empire, while, it, was, as, good, as, gold, in, the, north, it, was, even, better, in, the, south, as, it, was, rare, there, every, year, merchants, entered, mali, via, oualata, with, camel, loads, of, salt, to, sell, in, the, capital, ibn, battuta, had, written, that, in, taghaza, one, of, mali, s, most, important, salt, mines, there, were, no,

thick, slabs, two, of, which, were, loaded, onto, each, camel, where, they, would, be, taken, south, across, the, desert, to, oualata, and, sold, the, value, of, the, salt, was, chiefly, determined, by, the, transport, costs, according, to, ibn, battuta, one, camel, load, of, salt, sold, at, walata, for, 8, 10, mithqals, of, gold, but, in, mali, proper, it, was, worth, 20, 30, ducats, and, sometimes, even, 40, copper, was, also, a, valued, commodity, in, imperial, mali, according, to, ibn, battuta, copper, was, mined, from, takedda, in, the, north, and, traded, by, the, bar, in, the,
