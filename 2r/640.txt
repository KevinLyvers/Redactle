https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_human_sexuality
the, social, construction, of, human, sexuality, and, sexual, behavior, along, with, its, taboos, regulation, and, social, and, political, impact, has, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, various, cultures, of, the, world, since, prehistoric, times, the, work, of, swiss, jurist, johann, bachofen, made, a, major, impact, on, the, study, of, the, history, of, sexuality, many, authors, notably, lewis, henry, morgan, and, friedrich, engels, were, influenced, by, bachofen, and, criticized, bachofen, s, ideas, on, the, subject, which, were, almost, entirely, drawn, from, a, close, reading, of, ancient, mythology, in, his, 1861, book, mother, right, an, investigation, of, the, religious, and, juridical, character, of, matriarchy, in, the, ancient, world, bachofen, writes, that, in, the, beginning, human, sexuality, was, chaotic, and, promiscuous, this, aphroditic, stage, was, replaced, by, a, matriarchal, demeteric, stage, which, resulted, from, the, mother, being, the, only, reliable, way, of, establishing, descendants, only, upon, the, switch, to, male, enforced, monogamy, was, certainty, about, paternity, possible, giving, rise, to, patriarchy, the, ultimate, apolloan, stage, of, humanity, while, the, views, of, bachofen, are, not, based, on, empirical, evidence, they, are, important, because, of, the, impact, they, made, on, thinkers, to, come, especially, in, the, field, of, cultural, anthropology, modern, explanations, of, the, origins, of, human, sexuality, are, based, in, evolutionary, biology, and, specifically, the, field, of, human, behavioral, ecology, evolutionary, biology, shows, that, the, human, genotype, like, that, of, all, other, organisms, is, the, result, of, those, ancestors, who, reproduced, with, greater, frequency, than, others, the, resultant, sexual, behavior, adaptations, are, thus, not, an, attempt, on, the, part, of, the, individual, to, maximize, reproduction, in, a, given, situation, natural, selection, does, not, see, into, the, future, instead, current, behavior, is, probably, the, result, of, selective, forces, that, occurred, in, the, pleistocene, for, example, a, man, trying, to, have, sex, with, many, women, all, while, avoiding, parental, investment, is, not, doing, so, because, he, wants, to, increase, his, fitness, but, because, the, psychological, framework, that, evolved, and, thrived, in, the, pleistocene, never, went, away, sexual, speech, and, by, extension, writing, has, been, subject, to, varying, standards, of, decorum, since, the, beginning, of, history, for, most, of, historic, time, writing, has, not, been, used, by, more, than, a, small, part, of, the, total, population, of, any, society, the, resulting, self, censorship, and, euphemistic, forms, translate, today, into, a, dearth, of, explicit, and, accurate, evidence, on, which, to, base, a, history, there, are, a, number, of, primary, sources, that, can, be, collected, across, a, wide, variety, of, times, and, cultures, including, the, following, the, history, of, sexuality, and, gender, expression, varied, among, the, vast, diaspora, of, indigenous, tribes, the, berdache, a, cross, gender, role, existed, in, the, tribes, of, the, kaska, of, the, yukon, territory, the, klamath, of, southern, oregon, and, the, mohave, cocopa, and, maricopa, of, the, colorado, river, in, pre, colonial, times, berdache, individuals, partook, in, the, traditional, roles, of, the, other, sex, including, their, mannerisms, and, labour, cross, gender, females, in, the, mohave, tribe, conducted, ceremonies, in, which, they, would, fully, berdache, females, as, males, giving, them, the, right, to, marry, women, the, term, berdache, is, considered, outdated, in, the, modern, era, with, it, being, commonly, replaced, by, the, term, two, spirit, which, emphasises, how, native, americans, themselves, viewed, these, individuals, for, most, native, americans, the, person, s, spirit, was, more, important, than, their, physical, body, and, for, them, a, person, who, transgressed, from, their, original, gender, took, on, a, third, one, separate, from, the, male, or, female, gender, two, spirit, natives, would, often, be, a, part, of, same, sex, relationships, as, they, would, fulfil, the, necessary, duties, of, a, family, unit, that, was, expected, in, native, societies, however, two, spirit, individuals, of, the, same, sex, did, not, marry, one, another, as, the, roles, native, americans, played, in, marriages, mattered, more, than, sexuality, with, sexuality, not, as, imbedded, as, an, identity, as, it, is, currently, the, cross, gender, identity, faded, away, in, the, late, 19th, century, due, to, pressure, and, domination, by, white, settlers, and, their, imposition, of, their, sexual, values, and, ideologies, on, native, american, tribes, which, asserted, that, the, female, gender, was, inferior, and, that, homosexuality, was, unnatural, conceptions, of, marriage, also, varied, among, the, many, tribes, the, navajos, for, instance, practiced, polygamy, with, customs, entailing, that, the, wives, must, be, related, or, of, the, same, clan, the, practice, was, banned, in, july, 1945, by, the, navajo, tribal, council, due, to, pressure, from, the, united, states, government, which, sought, to, end, the, practice, as, it, enacted, its, own, prohibitions, on, polygamy, india, played, a, significant, role, in, the, history, of, sex, from, writing, one, of, the, first, literatures, that, treated, sexual, intercourse, as, a, science, to, in, modern, times, being, the, origin, of, the, philosophical, focus, of, new, age, groups, attitudes, on, sex, it, may, be, argued, that, india, pioneered, the, use, of, sexual, education, through, art, and, literature, as, in, many, societies, there, was, a, difference, in, sexual, practices, in, india, between, common, people, and, powerful, rulers, with, people, in, power, often, indulging, in, hedonistic, lifestyles, that, were, not, representative, of, common, moral, attitudes, the, first, evidence, of, attitudes, towards, sex, comes, from, the, ancient, texts, of, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, the, first, of, which, are, perhaps, the, oldest, surviving, literature, in, the, world, these, most, ancient, texts, the, vedas, reveal, moral, perspectives, on, sexuality, marriage, and, fertility, prayers, sex, magic, featured, in, a, number, of, vedic, rituals, most, significantly, in, the, asvamedha, yajna, where, the, ritual, culminated, with, the, chief, queen, lying, with, the, dead, horse, in, a, simulated, sexual, act, clearly, a, fertility, rite, intended, to, safeguard, and, increase, the, kingdom, s, productivity, and, martial, prowess, the, epics, of, ancient, india, the, ramayana, and, mahabharata, which, may, have, been, first, composed, as, early, as, 1400, bce, had, a, huge, effect, on, the, culture, of, asia, influencing, later, chinese, japanese, tibetan, and, south, east, asian, culture, these, texts, support, the, view, that, in, ancient, india, sex, was, considered, a, mutual, duty, between, a, married, couple, where, husband, and, wife, pleasured, each, other, equally, the, most, publicly, known, sexual, literature, of, india, are, the, texts, of, the, kama, sutra, these, texts, were, written, for, and, kept, by, the, philosopher, warrior, and, nobility, castes, their, servants, and, concubines, and, those, in, certain, religious, orders, these, were, people, that, could, also, read, and, write, and, had, instruction, and, education, the, sixty, four, arts, of, love, passion, pleasure, began, in, india, there, are, many, different, versions, of, the, arts, which, began, in, sanskrit, and, were, translated, into, other, languages, such, as, persian, or, tibetan, many, of, the, original, texts, are, missing, and, the, only, clue, to, their, existence, is, in, other, texts, kama, sutra, the, version, by, vatsyayana, is, one, of, the, well, known, survivors, and, was, first, translated, into, english, by, sir, richard, burton, and, f, f, arbuthnot, in, the, i, ching, the, book, of, changes, a, chinese, classic, text, dealing, with, divination, sexual, intercourse, is, one, of, two, fundamental, models, used, to, explain, the, world, with, neither, embarrassment, nor, circumlocution, heaven, is, described, as, having, sexual, intercourse, with, earth, similarly, with, no, sense, of, prurient, interest, the, male, lovers, of, early, chinese, men, of, great, political, power, are, mentioned, in, one, of, the, earliest, great, works, of, philosophy, and, literature, the, zhuang, zi, or, chuang, tzu, as, it, is, written, in, the, old, system, of, romanization, from, early, times, the, virginity, of, women, was, rigidly, enforced, by, family, and, community, and, linked, to, the, monetary, value, of, women, as, a, kind, of, commodity, the, sale, of, women, involving, the, delivery, of, a, bride, price, men, were, protected, in, their, own, sexual, adventures, by, a, transparent, double, standard, while, the, first, wife, of, a, man, with, any, kind, of, social, status, in, traditional, society, was, almost, certainly, chosen, for, him, by, his, father, and, or, grandfather, the, same, man, might, later, secure, for, himself, more, desirable, sexual, partners, with, the, status, of, concubines, in, addition, bondservants, in, his, possession, could, also, be, sexually, available, to, him, naturally, not, all, men, had, the, financial, resources, to, so, greatly, indulge, themselves, chinese, literature, displays, a, long, history, of, interest, in, affection, marital, bliss, unabashed, sexuality, romance, amorous, dalliances, homosexual, alliances, in, short, all, of, the, aspects, of, behavior, that, are, affiliated, with, sexuality, in, the, west, besides, the, previously, mentioned, zhuang, zi, passages, sexuality, is, exhibited, in, other, works, of, literature, such, as, the, tang, dynasty, yingying, zhuan, biography, of, cui, yingying, the, qing, dynasty, fu, sheng, liu, ji, six, chapters, of, a, floating, life, the, humorous, and, intentionally, salacious, jin, ping, mei, and, the, multi, faceted, and, insightful, hong, lou, meng, dream, of, the, red, chamber, also, called, story, of, the, stone, of, the, above, only, the, story, of, yingying, and, her, de, facto, husband, zhang, fail, to, describe, homosexual, as, well, as, heterosexual, interactions, the, novel, entitled, rou, bu, tuan, prayer, mat, of, flesh, even, describes, cross, species, organ, transplants, for, the, sake, of, enhanced, sexual, performance, among, chinese, literature, are, the, taoist, classical, texts, in, what, is, often, called, the, world, s, first, novel, the, genji, monogatari, tale, of, genji, which, dates, back, to, around, the, eighth, century, ad, eroticism, is, treated, as, a, central, part, of, the, aesthetic, life, of, the, nobility, the, sexual, interactions, of, prince, genji, are, described, in, great, detail, in, an, objective, tone, of, voice, and, in, a, way, that, indicates, that, sexuality, was, as, much, a, valued, component, of, cultured, life, as, music, or, any, of, the, arts, while, most, of, his, erotic, interactions, involve, women, there, is, one, telling, episode, in, which, genji, travels, a, fairly, long, distance, to, visit, one, of, the, women, with, whom, he, occasionally, consorts, but, finds, her, away, from, home, it, being, late, and, intercourse, already, being, on, the, menu, of, the, day, genji, takes, pleasure, in, the, availability, of, the, lady, s, younger, brother, who, he, reports, is, equally, satisfactory, as, an, erotic, partner, from, that, time, on, to, at, least, as, late, as, the, meiji, reformation, there, is, no, indication, that, sexuality, was, treated, in, a, pejorative, way, in, modern, times, homosexuality, was, driven, out, of, sight, until, it, reemerged, in, the, wake, of, the, sexual, revolution, with, seemingly, little, if, any, need, for, a, period, of, acceleration, yukio, mishima, probably, the, best, known, japanese, writer, in, the, outside, world, frequently, wrote, about, homosexuality, and, its, relationship, with, japanese, culture, new, and, old, likewise, prostitution, pornography, the, tradition, of, the, geisha, and, countless, types, of, fetish, and, sadomasochism, have, resurfaced, after, decades, underground, in, japan, sexuality, was, governed, by, the, same, social, forces, that, make, its, culture, considerably, different, from, that, of, china, korea, india, or, europe, in, japanese, society, the, primary, method, used, to, secure, social, control, is, the, threat, of, ostracism, more, attention, is, paid, to, what, is, polite, or, appropriate, to, show, others, than, to, which, behaviors, might, make, a, person, seem, corrupt, or, guilty, in, the, christian, sense, of, the, words, the, tendency, of, people, in, japanese, society, to, group, in, terms, of, in, groups, and, out, groups, residue, of, its, long, history, as, a, caste, society, is, a, source, of, great, pressure, on, every, facet, of, society, via, pop, culture, reflected, in, the, tribal, often, materialistic, and, very, complex, nature, of, teenage, subcultures, as, well, as, more, traditional, standards, as, in, the, high, pressure, role, of, the, salaryman, sexual, expression, ranges, from, a, requirement, to, a, complete, taboo, and, many, especially, teenagers, find, themselves, playing, many, otherwise, strictly, separate, roles, during, the, week, a, frequent, locus, of, misconceptions, in, regard, to, japanese, sexuality, is, the, institution, of, the, geisha, rather, than, being, a, prostitute, a, geisha, was, a, woman, trained, in, arts, such, as, music, and, cultured, conversation, and, who, was, available, for, non, sexual, interactions, with, her, male, clientele, these, women, differed, from, the, wives, that, their, patrons, probably, had, at, home, because, except, for, the, geisha, women, were, ordinarily, not, expected, to, be, prepared, for, anything, other, than, the, fulfillment, of, household, duties, this, limitation, imposed, by, the, normal, social, role, of, the, majority, of, women, in, traditional, society, produced, a, diminution, in, the, pursuits, that, those, women, could, enjoy, but, also, a, limitation, in, the, ways, that, a, man, could, enjoy, the, company, of, his, wife, the, geisha, fulfilled, the, non, sexual, social, roles, that, ordinary, women, were, prevented, from, fulfilling, and, for, this, service, they, were, well, paid, the, geisha, were, not, deprived, of, opportunities, to, express, themselves, sexually, and, in, other, erotic, ways, a, geisha, might, have, a, patron, with, whom, she, enjoyed, sexual, intimacy, but, this, sexual, role, was, not, part, of, her, role, or, responsibility, as, a, geisha, as, a, superficial, level, in, traditional, japanese, society, women, were, expected, to, be, highly, subservient, to, men, and, especially, to, their, husbands, so, in, a, socionormal, description, of, their, roles, they, were, little, more, than, housekeepers, and, faithful, sexual, partners, to, their, husbands, their, husbands, on, the, other, hand, might, consort, sexually, with, whomever, they, chose, outside, of, the, family, and, a, major, part, of, male, social, behavior, involves, after, work, forays, to, places, of, entertainment, in, the, company, of, male, cohorts, from, the, workplace, places, that, might, easily, offer, possibilities, of, sexual, satisfaction, outside, the, family, in, the, postwar, period, this, side, of, japanese, society, has, seen, some, liberalization, in, regard, to, the, norms, imposed, on, women, as, well, as, an, expansion, of, the, de, facto, powers, of, women, in, the, family, and, in, the, community, that, existed, unacknowledged, in, traditional, society, in, the, years, since, people, first, became, aware, of, the, aids, epidemic, japan, has, not, suffered, the, high, rates, of, disease, and, death, that, characterize, for, example, some, nations, in, africa, some, nations, in, southeast, asia, etc, in, 1992, the, government, of, japan, justified, its, continued, refusal, to, allow, oral, contraceptives, to, be, distributed, in, japan, on, the, fear, that, it, would, lead, to, reduced, condom, use, and, thus, increase, transmission, of, aids, as, of, 2004, condoms, accounted, for, 80, of, birth, control, use, in, japan, and, this, may, explain, japan, s, comparably, lower, rates, of, aids, in, ancient, greece, the, phallus, often, in, the, form, of, a, herma, was, an, object, of, worship, as, a, symbol, of, fertility, this, finds, expression, in, greek, sculpture, and, other, artworks, one, ancient, greek, male, idea, of, female, sexuality, was, that, women, envied, penises, of, males, wives, were, considered, a, commodity, and, instruments, for, bearing, legitimate, children, they, had, to, compete, sexually, with, eromenoi, hetaeras, and, slaves, in, their, own, homes, both, homosexuality, and, bisexuality, in, the, form, of, ephebophilia, in, some, ways, slavery, were, social, institutions, in, ancient, greece, and, were, integral, to, education, art, religion, and, politics, same, sex, relationships, between, adults, were, not, unknown, but, they, were, disfavored, lesbian, relations, were, also, of, a, pederastic, nature, rape, usually, in, the, context, of, warfare, was, common, and, was, seen, by, men, as, a, right, of, domination, rape, in, the, sense, of, abduction, followed, by, consensual, lovemaking, was, represented, even, in, religion, zeus, was, said, to, have, ravished, many, women, leda, in, the, form, of, a, swan, dana, disguised, as, a, golden, rain, alkmene, disguised, as, her, own, husband, zeus, also, raped, a, boy, ganymede, a, myth, that, paralleled, cretan, custom, the, ancient, etruscans, had, very, different, views, on, sexuality, when, compared, with, the, other, european, ancient, peoples, most, of, whom, had, inherited, the, indo, european, traditions, and, views, on, the, gender, roles, greek, writers, such, as, theopompus, and, plato, named, the, etruscan, immoral, and, from, their, descriptions, we, find, out, that, the, women, commonly, had, sex, with, men, who, were, not, their, husbands, and, that, in, their, society, children, were, not, labelled, illegitimate, just, because, they, did, not, know, who, the, father, was, theopompus, described, orgiastic, rituals, but, it, is, not, clear, whether, they, were, a, common, custom, or, only, a, minor, ritual, dedicated, to, a, certain, deity, in, the, roman, republic, the, citizen, s, duty, to, control, his, body, was, central, to, the, concept, of, male, sexuality, virtue, virtus, from, vir, man, was, equated, with, manliness, the, equivalent, virtue, for, female, citizens, of, good, social, standing, was, pudicitia, a, form, of, sexual, integrity, that, displayed, their, attractiveness, and, self, control, female, sexuality, was, encouraged, within, marriage, in, roman, patriarchal, society, a, real, man, was, supposed, to, govern, both, himself, and, others, well, and, should, not, submit, to, the, use, or, pleasure, of, others, same, sex, behaviors, were, not, perceived, as, diminishing, a, roman, s, masculinity, as, long, as, he, played, the, penetrative, or, dominating, role, acceptable, male, partners, were, social, inferiors, such, as, prostitutes, entertainers, and, slaves, sex, with, freeborn, male, minors, was, formally, prohibited, see, lex, scantinia, homosexual, and, heterosexual, thus, did, not, form, the, primary, dichotomy, of, roman, thinking, about, sexuality, and, no, latin, words, for, these, concepts, exist, depictions, of, frank, sexuality, are, abundant, in, roman, literature, and, art, the, fascinum, a, phallic, charm, was, a, ubiquitous, decoration, sexual, positions, and, scenarios, are, depicted, in, great, variety, among, the, wall, paintings, preserved, at, pompeii, and, herculaneum, collections, of, poetry, celebrated, love, affairs, and, the, art, of, love, by, the, augustan, poet, ovid, playfully, instructed, both, men, and, women, in, how, to, attract, and, enjoy, lovers, elaborate, theories, of, human, sexuality, based, on, greek, philosophy, were, developed, by, thinkers, such, as, lucretius, and, seneca, classical, myths, often, deal, with, sexual, themes, such, as, gender, identity, adultery, incest, and, rape, like, other, aspects, of, roman, life, sexuality, was, supported, and, regulated, by, traditional, roman, religion, both, the, public, cult, of, the, state, and, private, religious, practices, and, magic, cicero, held, that, the, desire, to, procreate, libido, was, the, seedbed, of, the, republic, as, it, was, the, cause, for, the, first, form, of, social, institution, marriage, which, in, turn, created, the, family, regarded, by, the, romans, as, the, building, block, of, civilization, roman, law, penalized, sex, crimes, stuprum, particularly, rape, as, well, as, adultery, a, roman, husband, however, committed, the, crime, of, adultery, only, when, his, sexual, partner, was, a, married, woman, prostitution, was, legal, public, and, widespread, entertainers, of, any, gender, were, assumed, to, be, sexually, available, see, infamia, and, gladiators, were, sexually, glamorous, the, dissolution, of, republican, ideals, of, physical, integrity, in, relation, to, political, liberty, has, been, hypothesized, to, contribute, to, and, reflect, the, sexual, license, and, decadence, associated, with, the, roman, empire, anxieties, about, the, loss, of, liberty, and, the, subordination, of, the, citizen, to, the, emperor, were, expressed, by, a, perceived, increase, in, passive, homosexual, behavior, among, free, men, sexual, conquest, was, a, frequent, metaphor, for, roman, imperialism, the, islands, have, been, noted, for, their, sexual, culture, many, sexual, activities, seen, as, taboo, in, western, cultures, were, viewed, as, appropriate, by, the, native, culture, contact, with, western, societies, has, changed, many, of, these, customs, so, research, into, their, pre, western, social, history, has, to, be, done, by, reading, antique,

expedition, as, yuri, s, reports, that, a, father, brought, a, 10, 12, year, old, girl, on, his, ship, and, she, had, sex, with, the, crew, according, to, the, book, by, tienne, marchand, eight, year, old, girls, had, sex, and, performed, other, sexual, acts, in, public, the, second, sexual, revolution, was, a, substantial, change, in, sexual, morality, and, sexual, behaviour, throughout, the, west, in, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, one, factor, in, the, change, of, values, pertaining, to, sexual, activities, was, the, invention, of, new, efficient, technologies, for, the, personal, control, of, ability, to, enter, pregnancy, prime, among, them, at, that, time, was, the, first, birth, control, pill, liberalized, laws, on, abortion, in, many, countries, likewise, made, it, possible, to, safely, and, legally, break, off, an, unwanted, pregnancy, without, having, to, invoke, a, birth, posing, grave, danger, to, the, health, of, the, mother, societal, attitudes, towards, same, sex, relationships, have, varied, over, time, and, place, from, requiring, all, males, to, engage, in, same, sex, relationships, to, casual, integration, through, acceptance, to, seeing, the, practice, as, a, minor, sin, repressing, it, through, law, enforcement, and, judicial, mechanisms, and, to, proscribing, it, under, penalty, of, death, in, a, detailed, compilation, of, historical, and, ethnographic, materials, of, pre, industrial, cultures, strong, disapproval, of, homosexuality, was, reported, for, 41, of, 42, cultures, it, was, accepted, or, ignored, by, 21, and, 12,

however, predates, christian, belief, it, was, frequent, in, ancient, greece, unnatural, can, be, traced, back, to, plato, many, historical, figures, including, socrates, lord, byron, edward, ii, and, hadrian, have, had, terms, such, as, gay, or, bisexual, applied, to, them, some, scholars, such, as, michel, foucault, have, regarded, this, as, risking, the, anachronistic, introduction, of, a, contemporary, construction, of, sexuality, foreign, to, their, times, though, others, challenge, this, a, common, thread, of, constructionist, argument, is, that, no, one, in, antiquity, or, the, middle, ages, experienced, homosexuality, as, an, exclusive, permanent, or, defining, mode, of, sexuality, john, boswell, has, countered, this, argument, by, citing, ancient, greek, writings, by, plato, which, describe, individuals, exhibiting, exclusive, homosexuality, abrahamic, religions, namely, judaism, samaritanism, christianity, the, bah, faith, and, islam, have, traditionally, affirmed, and, endorsed, a, patriarchal, and, heteronormative, approach, towards, human, sexuality, favouring, exclusively, penetrative, vaginal, intercourse, between, men, and, women, within, the,

to, human, reason, later, theologians, similarly, concluded, that, the, lust, involved, in, sexuality, was, a, result, of, original, sin, but, nearly, all, agreed, that, this, was, only, a, venial, sin, if, conducted, within, marriage, without, inordinate, lust, in, reformed, schools, as, represented, for, example, by, the, westminster, confession, three, purposes, of, marriage, are, drawn, out,

been, written, in, its, final, form, sometime, between, the, third, and, fifth, century, ad, based, on, circumstantial, evidence, apart, from, vatsyayana, s, kamashastra, which, is, no, doubt, the, most, famous, of, all, such, writings, there, exist, a, number, of, other, books, for, example, in, the, mid, 20th, century, advances, in, medical, science, and, modern, understanding, of, the, menstrual, cycle, led, to, observational, surgical, chemical, and, laboratory, techniques, to, allow, diagnosis, and, the, treatment, of, many, forms, of, infertility, the, birth, control, pill, introduced, in, the, 1960s, allowed, women, to, control, if, and, when, they, had, children, which, increased, their, freedom, both, sexually, and, socially, the, pill, was, illegal, in, many, countries, including, the, united, states, and, canada, as, the, notion, that, women, could, prevent, pregnancy, with, a, medication, incited, fear, in, many, people, due, to, misogynistic, views, on,

depictions, of, humans, and, animals, in, a, sexual, context, appear, infrequently, in, rock, art, in, europe, beginning, around, the, onset, of, the, neolithic, and, the, domestication, of, animals, bestiality, remained, a, common, theme, in, mythology, and, folklore, through, the, classical, period, and, into, the, middle, ages, e, g, leda, and, the, swan, and, several, ancient, authors, purported, to, document, it, as, a, regular, accepted, practice, albeit, usually, in, other, cultures, explicit, legal, prohibition, of, human, sexual, contact, with, animals, is, a, legacy, of, the,
