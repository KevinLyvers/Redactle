system, the, french, entry, into, world, war, i, saw, thousands, of, volunteers, primarily, from, the, french, protectorates, of, annam, and, tonkin, enlist, for, service, in, europe, around, 7, 8, of, all, french, indochinese, serving, in, europe, were, annamese, and, tonkinese, volunteers, this, period, also, saw, a, number, of, uprisings, in, tonkin, and, cochinchina, french, indochina, contributed, significantly, to, the, french, war, effort, in, terms, of, funds, products, and, human, resources, prior, to, world, war, i, the, population, of, french, indochina, stood, at, around, 16, 395, 000, in, 1913, with, 14, 165, 000, being, vietnamese, tonkinese, annamese, and, cochinchinese, 1, 600, 000, cambodians, and, 630, 000, laotians, these, 16, 4, million, subjects, were, ruled, over, by, only, around, 18, 000, french, civilians, militaries, and, civil, servants, during, this, period, governor, general, of, french, indochina, albert, sarraut, promised, a, new, policy, of, association, and, a, franco, annamese, collaboration, french, collaboration, franco, annamite, vietnamese, ph, p, vi, t, hu, for, the, wartime, contribution, by, the, french, indochinese, to, their, colonial, masters, however, beside, some, liberal, reforms, the, french, administration, actually, increased, economic, exploitation, and, ruthless, repression, of, nationalist, movements, which, rapidly, resulted, in, a, disappointment, of, the, promises, made, by, sarraut, during, the, early, days, of, the, war, around, 6, million, frenchmen, were, drafted, causing, a, severe, labour, shortage, in, france, in, response, the, undersecretary, of, state, for, artillery, and, munitions, proposed, to, hire, women, european, immigrants, and, french, colonial, subjects, these, people, were, later, followed, with, chinese, immigrants, from, 1915, onwards, the, french, war, effort, s, manpower, needs, started, to, rise, significantly, initially, the, french, maintained, a, racial, hierarchy, where, they, believed, in, martial, races, making, the, early, recruitment, fall, onus, primarily, on, north, africa, and, french, west, africa, but, soon, the, need, for, additional, manpower, forced, the, french, to, recruit, men, from, the, far, east, and, madagascar, almost, 100, 000, vietnamese, were, conscripts, and, went, to, europe, to, fight, and, serve, on, the, french, battlefront, or, work, as, labourers, vietnamese, troops, also, served, in, the, balkans, and, the, middle, eastern, front, this, exceptional, human, mobility, offered, the, french, indochinese, mostly, vietnamese, the, unique, opportunity, of, directly, access, to, social, life, and, political, debates, that, were, occurring, in, contemporary, france, and, this, resulted, in, their, aspirations, to, become, masters, of, their, own, destiny, to, increase, exposed, to, new, political, ideals, and, returning, to, a, colonial, occupation, of, their, own, country, by, a, ruler, that, many, of, them, had, fought, and, died, for, resulted, in, some, sour, attitudes, many, of, these, troops, sought, out, and, joined, the, vietnamese, nationalist, movement, focused, on, overthrowing, the, french, in, 1925, communist, and, anti, french, activist, nguy, n, i, qu, c, later, known, as, h, ch, minh, wrote, taken, in, chains, confined, in, a, school, compound, most, of, them, will, never, again, see, the, sun, of, their, country, and, a, number, of, historians, like, joseph, buttinger, and, martin, murray, treated, his, statement, by, nguy, n, i, qu, c, as, an, article, of, faith, and, believed, that, the, vietnamese, men, who, participated, in, world, war, i, were, forcibly, recruited, by, means, of, terrorism, later, historians, would, claim, that, the, recruitment, enterprise, employed, during, this, period, was, only, ostensibly, voluntary, while, there, is, some, truth, to, these, claims, the, vast, majority, of, the, men, who, volunteered, for, service, in, europe, were, indeed, volunteers, among, the, motivations, of, volunteering, were, both, personal, and, economic, ambitions, some, french, indochinese, volunteers, wished, to, see, what, the, world, looked, like, beyond, the, bamboo, hedges, in, their, villages, while, others, preferred, the, money, and, the, opportunity, to, see, what, france, actually, looks, like, their, service, would, expose, them, to, the, brutality, of, modern, warfare, and, many, would, change, their, perception, about, many, social, norms, and, beliefs, at, home, because, of, their, experiences, abroad, of, the, 93, 000, french, indochinese, soldiers, and, workers, who, came, to, europe, most, were, from, the, poorest, parts, of, annam, and, tonkin, which, had, been, badly, hit, by, famine, and, cholera, a, smaller, number, 1, 150, of, french, indochinese, soldiers, and, workers, came, from, cambodia, in, northeast, france, around, 44, 000, vietnamese, troops, served, in, direct, combat, functions, at, both, the, battle, of, the, vosges, and, the, battle, of, verdun, french, indochinese, battalions, were, also, used, in, various, logistics, functions, such, as, serving, as, drivers, to, transport, soldiers, to, the, front, lines, stretcher, bearers, brancardiers, or, road, crews, vietnamese, soldiers, were, also, used, to, sanitise, battle, fields, at, the, end, of, the, war, where, they, would, perform, these, duties, in, the, middle, of, the, cold, european, winters, without, being, provided, with, warm, clothes, in, order, to, let, the, white, french, soldiers, return, to, their, homes, earlier, the, financial, expenses, of, the, 93, 000, french, indochinese, labourers, and, soldiers, sent, to, france, during, the, war, salaries, pensions, family, allocations, the, levy, in, kind, mostly, rice, and, even, the, functioning, of, the, indochinese, hospital, were, entirely, financed, from, the, budget, of, french, indochina, itself, and, not, from, france, one, of, the, effects, of, world, war, i, on, french, indochinese, society, was, the, introduction, of, a, vibrant, political, press, both, in, french, and, in, the, indigenous, languages, that, led, to, the, political, radicalisation, of, a, new, generation, of, nationalists, because, most, of, the, indigenous, people, that, served, in, france, and, the, rest, of, europe, during, the, war, were, vietnamese, these, social, and, political, developments, affected, the, vietnamese, more, because, french, cochinchina, was, a, direct, french, colony, it, enjoyed, favourable, legislation, concerning, the, press, which, fostered, a, public, sphere, of, oppositional, political, activism, although, these, developments, occurred, throughout, french, indochina, they, were, more, strongly, felt, in, cochinchina, due, to, its, more, open, society, the, french, indochinese, in, europe, experienced, much, more, egalitarian, social, relations, which, were, strongly, contrasted, with, the, racial, hierarchy, they, experienced, at, home, in, france, the, french, indochinese, serving, often, engaged, in, comradery, with, the, french, and, many, had, romantic, relationships, with, french, women, the, latter, being, unthinkable, in, their, home, countries, during, this, period, the, french, protectorates, of, annam, and, tonkin, were, initially, ruled, by, the, duy, t, n, emperor, however, in, 1916, the, duy, t, n, emperor, was, accused, by, the, french, of, calling, for, his, subjects, to, resist, french, rule, and, after, his, deposition, he, and, his, father, were, exiled, to, the, island, of, la, r, union, in, the, indian, ocean, thereafter, the, kh, i, nh, emperor, became, the, new, monarch, of, annam, and, tonkin, and, he, closely, collaborated, with, the, french, administration, at, the, same, time, cambodia, was, ruled, by, king, sisowath, who, was, crowned, in, 1904, and, cooperated, closely, with, the, french, administration, in, his, territory, king, sisowath, attended, the, colonial, exhibition, in, marseilles, in, 1906, and, was, the, king, at, the, time, of, the, retrocession, of, the, provinces, of, battambang, and, siem, reap, to, cambodia, by, the, siamese, in, april, 1907, during, the, reign, of, king, sisowath, there, was, an, inexorable, increase, in, french, control, and, the, french, residents, gained, executive, authority, to, issue, royal, decrees, appoint, officials, and, collect, taxes, the, french, protectorate, of, laos, at, the, time, was, ruled, by, king, sisavang, vong, who, was, crowned, king, in, 1904, king, sisavang, vong, was, trained, at, the, lyc, e, chasseloup, laubat, in, saigon, and, at, the, colonial, school, in, paris, in, 1914, the, french, built, a, new, palace, in, luang, prabang, for, him, and, a, new, agreement, with, the, french, administration, signed, in, 1917, allowed, him, only, formal, signs, of, royal, power, with, actual, power, over, laos, being, in, the, hands, of, the, french, the, great, war, presented, a, number, of, opportunities, for, the, indigenous, french, indochinese, people, serving, in, the, west, that, didn, t, exist, before, notably, for, some, individuals, to, obtain, levels, of, education, that, were, simply, unattainable, at, home, by, acquiring, more, advanced, technical, and, professional, skills, for, example, dr, nguy, n, xu, n, mai, who, in, 1910, became, one, of, the, first, indigenous, auxiliaries, to, graduate, the, hanoi, medical, school, hoped, to, gain, his, phd, in, france, so, he, enlisted, to, fight, in, the, war, in, 1921, he, would, acquire, his, doctorate, and, he, became, one, of, the, first, vietnamese, doctors, to, enjoy, the, same, rights, as, his, french, colleagues, while, world, war, i, saw, a, number, of, new, economic, sectors, develop, in, french, indochina, namely, rubber, plantations, mines, and, other, forms, of, agriculture, these, were, all, french, owned, and, the, local, trade, to, the, great, export, import, houses, was, in, the, hands, of, the, overseas, chinese, communities, only, a, handful, of, vietnamese, landlords, moneylenders, and, middlemen, benefitted, from, the, new, economic, opportunities, that, arose, during, this, period, as, the, colonial, economy, of, exportation, was, designed, to, enrich, the, french, at, the, expense, of, the, indigenous, population, during, this, same, period, the, average, livelihood, of, the, indigenous, peasantry, was, drastically, decreased, due, to, both, direct, taxation, and, indirect, taxes, the, french, used, to, finance, ambitious, public, works, programmes, constructed, using, the, corv, e, system, prior, to, the, year, 1914, the, mise, en, valeur, development, and, improvement, of, french, indochina, was, primarily, financed, by, european, french, public, loans, french, private, capital, and, higher, taxes, on, the, local, populations, but, during, the, war, french, indochina, became, completely, responsible, both, for, financing, itself, and, the, people, they, sent, to, europe, to, fight, in, the, war, as, investment, funds, from, metropolitan, france, completely, stopped, this, meant, that, taxation, increased, more, rice, was, being, exported, and, the, locals, purchased, war, bonds, french, indochina, provided, a, metropolitan, france, with, large, financial, aid, between, the, years, 1915, and, 1920, of, the, 600, 000, 000, francs, that, france, received, from, its, colonial, empire, 367, 000, 000, francs, were, sent, by, french, indochina, though, historian, patrice, morlat, places, the, initial, financial, contribution, of, french, indochina, at, 381, 000, 000, gold, francs, valued, at, 997, 000, 000, euros, in, 2017, roughly, 60, of, all, financial, contributions, metropolitan, france, received, from, its, colonial, empire, excluding, algeria, morlat, further, noted, that, french, indochina, supplied, 340, 000, tonnes, of, raw, materials, to, france, during, the, course, of, the, war, which, amounted, to, 34, of, all, raw, supplies, that, metropolitan, france, received, from, its, colonies, the, shipping, of, these, materials, was, threatened, by, the, presence, of, german, submarines, world, war, i, also, saw, the, colonial, government, of, cochinchina, authorising, the, creation, of, vietnamese, language, newspapers, in, 1916, this, was, done, to, secure, popular, support, for, the, war, effort, the, colonial, authorities, hoped, that, this, would, create, a, loyal, indigenous, group, of, politically, active, people, the, cochinchinese, colonial, government, offered, financial, support, to, these, loyalist, newspapers, but, kept, close, control, on, the, contents, written, in, them, to, ensure, a, prevailing, pro, french, narrative, the, editors, of, these, newspapers, were, often, retours, de, france, people, back, from, france, and, were, kept, under, close, surveillance, as, they, often, had, connections, to, anti, french, dissidents, and, activists, among, these, newspapers, was, la, tribune, indig, ne, the, indigenous, forum, launched, in, 1917, by, the, agronomist, b, i, quang, chi, u, working, together, with, the, lawyer, d, ng, v, n, gi, o, and, journalist, nguy, n, phan, long, afterwards, they, created, la, tribune, indochinoise, the, indochinese, forum, and, in, 1919, these, three, men, would, found, the, indochinese, constitutionalist, party, in, saigon, because, of, these, activities, the, french, sur, t, regarded, their, nationalism, as, dangerous, the, french, invoked, a, supposed, german, connection, between, the, vietnamese, revolutionaries, and, the, german, empire, alleging, that, hong, kong, bangkok, and, beijing, were, the, sight, of, german, agents, hoping, to, help, the, vietnamese, revolutionaries, as, they, shared, the, same, goal, namely, to, defeat, the, french, world, war, i, also, saw, a, number, of, rebellions, throughout, french, indochina, in, 1914, 3, major, uprisings, happened, throughout, vietnam, followed, by, a, number, of, revolts, in, cochinchina, from, 1914, to, 1917, members, of, the, tai, lue, people, led, by, prince, phra, ong, kham, chao, fa, of, muang, sing, organised, a, long, anti, french, campaign, hmong, independence, movements, in, laos, also, challenged, french, rule, in, the, country, 1914, also, saw, bands, of, yunnanese, revolutionaries, invade, french, indochina, who, crossed, the, border, and, started, attacking, french, military, posts, parading, chinese, republican, flags, these, rebels, were, later, joined, by, various, laotian, ethnic, minorities, lao, kha, and, black, tai, the, joint, yunnanese, and, laotian, ethnic, minority, rebels, spread, misinformation, claiming, that, paris, has, been, crushed, by, the, german, army, to, make, the, french, seem, weaker, the, motivations, of, this, revolt, are, disputed, as, contemporary, french, colonial, officials, attributed, it, to, chinese, opium, smugglers, while, the, canadian, historian, geoffrey, c, gunn, thinks, that, it, was, a, political, revolt, in, february, 1916, in, cochinchina, supporters, of, phan, x, ch, long, marched, on, the, saigonese, penitentiary, where, he, was, held, demanding, his, release, this, coincided, with, other, uprisings, in, the, mekong, delta, the, mandarin, tr, n, cao, v, n, engaged, with, he, duy, t, n, emperor, to, try, and, stage, a, large, rebellion, in, annam, in, 1916, but, their, conspiracy, was, discovered, and, foiled, by, the, french, in, 1916, the, kingdom, of, cambodia, saw, a, 3, month, uprising, organised, by, between, 30, 000, and, 100, 000, peasants, against, both, the, mandatory, corv, e, and, the, increased, taxes, australian, historian, milton, osborne, refers, to, this, uprising, as, the, 1916, affair, the, circumstances, leading, up, to, this, large, revolt, were, directly, caused, by, the, war, 30, august, 1917, saw, the, beginning, of, the, th, i, nguy, n, uprising, which, lasted, until, 1918, the, large, amount, of, uprisings, and, rebellions, that, occurred, during, the, war, would, inspire, the, creation, of, a, political, security, apparatus, that, was, used, to, find, and, arrest, political, dissidents, in, the, post, war, period, on, 27, august, 1914, japan, officially, entered, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, allies, also, known, as, the, entente, powers, japan, invaded, and, took, the, german, colony, of, tsingtao, and, the, rest, of, the, kiautschou, bay, leased, territory, in, november, 1914, japan, supplanted, the, german, sphere, of, influence, in, southern, china, with, its, own, political, and, economic, influence, putting, it, in, direct, competition, with, french, indochina, even, though, the, japanese, openly, supported, a, number, of, anti, french, secessionist, movements, such, as, prince, c, ng, s, duy, t, n, h, i, the, french, situation, in, europe, was, bad, enough, for, prime, minister, georges, clemenceau, to, ask, the, japanese, for, their, help, the, war, situation, in, europe, was, so, bad, that, in, 1914, the, french, considered, exchanging, french, indochina, with, japan, for, both, financial, and, military, support, but, this, idea, was, quickly, abandoned, clemenceau, asked, the, empire, of, japan, to, aid, them, with, the, transportation, of, the, travailleurs, et, tirailleurs, indochinois, to, europe, and, by, sending, its, own, forces, to, help, fight, in, europe, clemenceau, also, wanted, japan, to, help, by, intervening, in, siberia, to, fight, the, bolshevik, forces, during, the, russian, civil, war, to, prevent, the, loss, of, the, many, french, russian, loans, which, were, important, for, the, french, post, war, economy, in, 1918, the, idea, of, selling, french, indochina, to, japan, was, raised, again, and, like, the, first, time, that, it, was, proposed, it, was, abandoned, again, both, during, and, after, the, war, the, economic, relations, between, france, and, japan, strengthened, as, japan, became, a, creditor, of, france, following, the, latter, s, financial, difficulties, which, came, as, a, result, of, the, war, as, sarraut, was, determined, to, secure, french, rule, over, the, country, he, created, a, strong, political, surveillance, apparatus, that, functioned, throughout, french, indochina, he, centralised, all, local, police, forces, and, developed, an, intelligence, service, these, policies, would, lead, to, the, creation, of, the, s, ret, g, n, rale, indochinoise, which, sought, to, monitor, and, police, anti, french, activities, both, inside, and, outside, of, french, indochina, french, security, was, expanded, because, of, fears, of, german, involvement, with, their, enemies, in, the, far, east, gaston, ernest, li, bert, the, french, consul, in, hong, kong, and, a, major, player, for, the, intelligence, services, coordinated, by, the, political, affairs, bureau, of, french, indochina, noted, that, vietnamese, revolutionaries, and, germany, both, shared, the, same, interest, the, defeat, of, the, french, li, bert, argued, that, french, indochinese, who, rebelled, should, be, treated, according, or, as, traitors, to, france, another, reason, for, the, expansion, of, the, security, state, was, that, the, french, feared, that, such, a, large, expulsion, of, french, soldiers, to, fight, against, the, germans, would, inspire, a, general, uprising, similar, to, what, the, british, experienced, in, egypt, in, april, 1916, the, administrator, of, civil, services, at, the, political, affairs, bureau, in, hanoi, launched, two, voluminous, reports, that, went, into, great, detail, about, the, parallel, histories, of, what, he, referred, to, as, the, annamese, revolutionary, party, how, he, called, the, duy, t, n, h, i, and, of, the, secret, societies, of, french, cochinchina, these, two, reports, proved, to, be, very, important, to, the, political, affairs, bureau, as, they, would, trigger, a, full, scale, reform, of, the, organisation, making, it, into, an, umbrella, organisation, the, reform, policies, were, enacted, to, help, control, the, narrative, around, french, rule, through, policing, and, surveillance, the, colonial, police, forces, were, connected, with, the, general, control, of, indochinese, workers, and, riflemen, contr, le, g, n, ral, des, travailleurs, et, tirailleurs, indochinois, a, political, police, force, as, the, military, presence, was, reduced, to, allocate, more, soldiers, to, the, home, front, in, metropolitan, france, these, nascent, surveillance, organisations, were, put, in, charge, of, policing, the, 100, 000, french, indochinese, present, to, help, fight, the, central, powers, following, the, communist, victory, in, the, october, revolution, the, security, apparatus, of, french, indochina, was, strengthened, to, fight, the, bolshevik, danger, in, the, colonies, while, the, s, ret, g, n, rale, was, created, during, world, war, i, in, 1922, it, was, expanded, to, become, a, better, instrument, to, surveil, and, repress, any, potential, bolshevik, elements, first, in, metropolitan, france, and, later, in, french, indochina, the, activities, of, the, s, ret, g, n, rale, indochinoise, were, managed, by, the, newly, created, department, of, political, affairs, the, s, ret, g, n, rale, indochinoise, would, be, used, as, the, paramount, tool, to, gather, intelligence, of, subversive, elements, within, french, indochinese, society, and, to, conduct, large, scale, union, wide, registration, by, the, colonial, police, forces, of, suspects, and, convicts, the, increase, in, surveillance, and, repression, was, accompanied, with, a, propaganda, campaign, aimed, to, convince, the, indigenous, populations, of, the, enlightenment, of, french, colonialism, both, the, indigenous, peasantry, and, the, elites, had, to, be, won, over, by, being, told, of, the, many, advantages, of, colonialism, the, political, affairs, bureau, assembled, a, umber, of, vietnamese, elites, belonging, to, the, indigenous, intelligentsia, through, the, french, school, of, the, far, east, to, aid, in, the, pro, french, propaganda, effort, while, the, french, hoped, to, isolate, political, dissidents, by, locking, them, up, in, prisons, these, prisons, would, ironically, turn, into, schools, for, nationalism, and, communism, as, concentrating, a, large, number, of, political, enemies, together, would, allow, them, to, communicate, with, each, other, which, contributed, to, the, growth, of, communism, within, french, indochina, as, french, indochina, was, supposed, to, be, a, self, financed, colonie, d, exploitation, conomique, colony, of, economic, exploitation, most, of, its, budget, during, this, period, was, financed, through, revenue, collection, taxes, on, the, local, populations, and, consumption, quotas, for, monopolised, goods, such, as, opium, salt, and, alcohol, in, 1920, 44, of, the, french, indochinese, government, budget, came, from, opium, salt, and, alcohol, alone, during, the, 1920s, france, allowed, more, vietnamese, to, enter, metropolitan, france, for, both, studying, and, work, purposes, both, legal, and, illegal, immigrants, entered, france, from, french, indochina, working, various, types, of, jobs, such, as, sailors, photographers, cooks, restaurant, and, shop, owners, and, manual, labourers, in, france, many, vietnamese, immigrants, and, their, organisations, aligned, themselves, with, the, french, communist, party, pcf, who, promised, to, represent, them, both, in, legal, and, political, matters, as, returnees, from, france, were, more, skilled, and, spoke, fluent, french, the, french, colonists, in, indochina, would, hire, them, to, perform, better, paying, jobs, and, often, brought, ideas, of, the, successful, bolshevik, revolution, in, russia, in, provinces, like, thanh, ho, ngh, an, and, h, t, nh, where, around, twenty, thousand, returnees, lived, pro, bolshevik, activities, would, increase, during, this, decade, and, this, region, saw, the, creation, of, many, pro, bolshevik, parties, a, number, of, vietnamese, men, would, serve, in, occupied, parts, of, weimar, era, germany, after, the, war, seeing, how, the, french, treated, the, german, inhabitants, of, the, occupied, regions, some, vietnamese, soldiers, would, empathise, with, the, german, people, official, reports, on, the, french, occupation, of, the, rhineland, summarised, the, contents, of, the, letters, written, by, the, soldiers, during, that, period, this, way, the, french, oppress, the, germans, in, the, same, way, they, have, the, annamites, after, the, great, war, former, governor, general, albert, sarraut, became, the, french, minister, of, the, colonies, sarraut, was, the, architect, of, the, collaboration, franco, annamite, which, characterised, french, colonial, policy, during, the, interwar, period, regarding, the, internal, security, of, the, french, apparatus, in, the, far, east, sarraut, stated, i, have, always, estimated, that, indochina, must, be, protected, against, the, effects, of, a, revolutionary, propaganda, that, i, have, never, underestimated, by, carrying, out, a, double, action, one, political, the, other, repressive, indicating, that, he, saw, repressing, subversive, elements, as, paramount, to, the, continued, french, domination, of, the, region, his, policies, benefited, collaborators, while, they, were, instrumental, in, repressing, dissidents, sarraut, boasted, the, image, of, himself, as, a, liberal,

country, at, the, end, of, their, logistical, trails, was, validated, at, the, battle, of, n, s, n, even, though, the, base, was, relatively, weak, because, of, a, lack, of, concrete, and, steel, french, efforts, were, made, more, difficult, due, to, the, limited, usefulness, of, armoured, tanks, in, a, forested, and, mountainous, environment, lack, of, strong, air, forces, for, air, cover,

won, the, decisive, victory, against, french, forces, at, the, gruelling, battle, of, dien, bien, phu, on, 20, july, 1954, the, geneva, conference, produced, the, geneva, agreements, between, north, vietnam, and, france, provisions, included, supporting, the, territorial, integrity, and, sovereignty, of, indochina, granting, it, independence, from, france, declaring, the, cessation, of, hostilities, and, foreign, involvement, in, internal, indochina, affairs, and, delineating, northern, and, southern, zones, into, which, opposing, troops, were, to, withdraw, the, agreements,

to, fall, to, communism, then, there, would, be, multiple, other, countries, that, would, fall, to, the, ideology, in, southeast, asia, from, vietnam, to, india, there, would, be, a, dramatic, shift, in, global, power, eisenhower, chose, to, not, put, boots, on, the, ground, but, his, decision, to, start, to, get, involved, likely, is, more, important, to, the, countries, eventual, step, into, the, country, than, johnson, s, decision, to, take, that, last, step, eisenhower, had, a, further, impact, in, that, he, would, continue, to, provide, support, for, future, presidents, policy, in, the, country, lyndon, b, johnson, and, gerald, ford, both, used, him, to, large, extents, kennedy, did, have, several, meetings, with, him, in, the, white, house, and, nixon, was, mostly, on, his,

governor, general, was, assisted, by, a, system, of, different, government, agencies, however, these, agencies, functioned, only, to, be, consultants, to, help, the, governor, general, perform, his, role, and, exercise, his, powers, the, protectorates, of, cambodia, annam, tonkin, and, laos, all, had, residents, superior, while, the, colony, of, cochinchina, had, a, governor, in, the,

approved, by, either, the, resident, superior, of, annam, or, by, the, governor, general, of, french, indochina, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, gia, long, era, ho, ng, vi, t, lu, t, l, sometimes, known, as, the, gia, long, code, remained, the, main, civil, code, of, the, nguy, n, dynasty, until, the, emperor, issued, the, nearly, identical, civil, code, of, annam, and, civil, code, of, tonkin, a, number, of, the, legal, documents, in, effect, in, the, french, republic, were, also, applied, to, french, indochina, these, included, the, code, napol, on, of, 1804, the, code, de, commerce, of, 1807, the, code, d, instruction, criminelle, and, the, french, penal, code, of, 1810, these, laws, took, effect, in, french, indochina, on, the, date, that, the, governor, general, issued, decrees, that, they, would, also, apply, to, the, federation, the, legislative, decrees, of, the, governor, general, had, to, be, sent, to, the, minister, of, colonies, for, consideration, the, minister, would, then, approve, or, disapprove, the, decrees, however, the, minister, of, colonies, was, not, entitled, to, make, any, amendments, to, the, decrees, and, if, they, wished, to, alter, it, they, would, have, to, draft, it, and, then, send, the, draft, to, the, president, of, france, only, french, presidential, decrees, could, overturn, the, decrees, of, the, governor, general, executive, decrees, did, not, have, to, be, sent, to, metropolitan, france, for, review, and, immediately, came, into, effect, throughout, vietnam, thousands, of, villages, had, their, own, independent, legal, codes, that, governed, the, social, relations, within, the, village, community, thousands, of, written, regulations, existed, and, the, central, administration, often, recognised, them, these, legal, codes, were, known, as, the, h, ng, c, h, ng, l, and, l, l, ng, which, could, be, translated, as, rural, covenants, and, also, existed, in, china, and, korea, the, h, ng, c, contained, rules, about, various, legal, practices, like, land, management, marriage, labour, relations, arbitration, of, disputes, as, well, as, local, customs, such, as, family, relations, village, relations, ghosts, ancestor, worship, sacrifice, mourning, and, longing, both, the, government, general, of, french, indochina, and, the, government, of, the, nguy, n, dynasty, attempted, reform, these, rules, and, regulations, in, their, favour, to, expand, their, power, into, vietnamese, hamlets, and, villages, the, french, administration, issued, models, for, the, villages, to, follow, but, many, vietnamese, villages, still, functioned, independent, of, the, french, and, nguy, n, administrations, the, vietnamese, lao, and, khmer, ethnic, groups, formed, the, majority, of, their, respective, colony, s, populations, minority, groups, such, as, the, muong, tay, chams, and, jarai, were, collectively, known, as, montagnards, and, resided, principally, in, the, mountain, regions, of, indochina, ethnic, han, chinese, were, largely, concentrated, in, major, cities, especially, the, hoa, in, cochinchina, and, the, chen, in, cambodia, where, they, became, heavily, involved, in, trade, and, commerce, in, addition, there, was, also, a, tiny, french, minority, which, accounted, for, 0, 2, of, the, population, or, 39, 000, people, by, 1940, around, 95, of, french, indochina, s, population, was, rural, in, a, 1913, estimate, although, urbanisation, did, slowly, grow, over, the, course, of, french, rule, the, principal, religion, in, french, indochina, was, buddhism, with, mahayana, buddhism, influenced, by, confucianism, more, dominant, in, vietnam, while, therav, da, buddhism, was, more, widespread, in, laos, and, cambodia, in, addition, active, roman, catholic, missionaries, were, widespread, throughout, indochina, and, roughly, 10, of, tonkin, s, population, identified, as, catholic, by, the, end, of, french, rule, cao, i, s, and, h, a, h, o, s, origins, began, during, this, period, as, well, unlike, algeria, french, settlement, in, indochina, did, not, occur, at, a, grand, scale, by, 1940, only, about, 34, 000, french, civilians, lived, in, french, indochina, along, with, a, smaller, number, of, french, military, personnel, and, government, workers, 6, 000, of, these, almost, half, 16, 550, lived, in, cochinchina, the, vast, majority, living, in, saigon, the, principal, reasons, why, french, settlement, did, not, grow, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, in, french, north, africa, which, had, a, population, of, over, 1, million, french, civilians, were, because, french, indochina, was, seen, as, a, colonie, d, exploitation, conomique, colony, for, economic, exploitation, rather, than, a, colonie, de, peuplement, settlement, colony, helping, metropolitan, france, from, being, overpopulated, and, because, indochina, was, distant, from, france, itself, during, french, colonial, rule, the, french, language, was, the, principal, language, of, education, government, trade, and, media, and, french, was, widely, introduced, to, the, general, population, french, became, widespread, among, urban, and, semi, urban, populations, and, became, the, principal, language, of, the, elite, and, educated, this, was, most, notable, in, the, colonies, of, tonkin, and, cochinchina, northern, and, southern, vietnam, respectively, where, french, influence, was, most, heavy, while, annam, laos, and, cambodia, were, less, influenced, by, french, education, despite, the, dominance, of, french, in, official, and, educational, settings, local, populations, still, largely, spoke, their, native, languages, after, french, rule, ended, the, french, language, was, still, largely, used, among, the, new, governments, with, the, exception, of, north, vietnam, today, french, continues, to, be, taught, as, a, second, language, in, the, former, colonies, and, used, in, some, administrative, affairs, french, indochina, was, designated, as, a, colonie, d, exploitation, colony, of, economic, exploitation, by, the, french, government, funding, for, the, colonial, government, came, by, means, of, taxes, on, locals, and, the, french, government, established, a, near, monopoly, on, the, trade, of, opium, salt, and, rice, alcohol, the, french, administration, established, quotas, of, consumption, for, each, vietnamese, village, thereby, compelling, villagers, to, purchase, and, consume, set, amounts, of, these, monopolised, goods, the, trade, of, those, three, products, formed, about, 44, of, the, colonial, government, s, budget, in, 1920, but, declined, to, 20, by, 1930, as, the, colony, began, to, economically, diversify, the, colony, s, principal, bank, was, the, banque, de, l, indochine, established, in, 1875, and, was, responsible, for, minting, the, colony, s, currency, the, indochinese, piastre, indochina, was, the, second, most, invested, in, french, colony, by, 1940, after, algeria, with, investments, totalling, up, to, 6, 7, million, francs, during, the, first, six, months, of, world, war, i, the, government, general, would, expel, all, german, and, austro, hungarian, people, living, in, french, indochina, the, two, pre, war, import, export, houses, speidel, co, and, f, engler, co, were, officially, re, organised, as, french, companies, however, in, reality, they, continued, to, operate, under, both, german, control, and, using, german, capital, during, the, 1910s, speidel, co, was, the, largest, importer, of, european, goods, into, the, country, with, engler, being, one, of, its, major, competitors, after, the, german, owners, were, expelled, from, the, company, lower, level, employees, tried, to, continue, running, these, companies, despite, increasing, push, back, from, the, french, colonial, authorities, by, means, of, arbitrary, customs, enforcement, freight, interference, and, regulatory, aggravations, later, the, french, would, seize, all, of, the, german, speidel, company, s, warehouses, and, would, sell, the, seized, goods, at, low, prices, both, to, vietnamese, consumers, and, chinese, exporters, to, try, to, increase, revenue, these, goods, included, rice, wine, and, canned, goods, during, world, war, i, export, regulations, kept, changing, which, the, chinese, export, businesses, took, advantage, of, by, purchasing, rice, for, minimal, prices, from, the, vietnamese, farmers, who, grew, it, and, then, deliberately, passing, along, the, risks, of, the, export, trade, to, those, small, vietnamese, farmers, who, were, the, least, able, to, bear, the,

resources, and, to, economically, diversify, the, colony, cochinchina, annam, and, tonkin, encompassing, modern, day, vietnam, became, a, source, of, tea, rice, coffee, pepper, coal, zinc, and, tin, while, cambodia, became, a, centre, for, rice, and, pepper, crops, only, laos, was, seen, initially, as, an, economically, unviable, colony, although, timber, was, harvested, at, a, small, scale, from, there, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, growing, automobile, industry, in, france, resulted, in, the, growth, of, the, rubber, industry, in, french, indochina, and, plantations, were, built, throughout, the, colony, especially, in, annam, and, cochinchina, france, soon, became, a, leading, producer, of, rubber, through, its, indochina, colony, and, indochinese, rubber, became, prized, in, the, industrialised, world, the, success, of, rubber, plantations, in, french, indochina, resulted, in, an, increase, in, investment, in, the, colony, by, various, firms, such, as, michelin, with, the, growing, number, of, investments, in, the, colony, s, mines, and, rubber, tea, and, coffee, plantations, french, indochina, began, to, industrialise, as, factories, opened, in,

purposes, from, trading, outposts, to, resort, towns, the, most, notable, examples, include, sa, pa, in, northern, vietnam, l, t, in, central, vietnam, and, pakse, in, laos, the, governments, of, vietnam, laos, and, cambodia, have, previously, been, reluctant, to, promote, their, colonial, architecture, as, an, asset, for, tourism, however, in, recent, times, the, new, generation, of, local, authorities, has, somewhat, embraced, the, architecture, and, advertise, it, the, heaviest, concentration, of, french, era, buildings, are, in, hanoi, l, t, haiphong, ho, chi, minh, city, hu, and,
