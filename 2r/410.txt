the, partitions, of, poland, were, three, partitions, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, that, took, place, toward, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, ended, the, existence, of, the, state, resulting, in, the, elimination, of, sovereign, poland, and, lithuania, for, 123, years, the, partitions, were, conducted, by, the, habsburg, monarchy, the, kingdom, of, prussia, and, the, russian, empire, which, divided, up, the, commonwealth, lands, among, themselves, progressively, in, the, process, of, territorial, seizures, and, annexations, the, first, partition, was, decided, on, august, 5, 1772, after, the, bar, confederation, lost, the, war, with, russia, the, second, partition, occurred, in, the, aftermath, of, the, polish, russian, war, of, 1792, and, the, targowica, confederation, when, russian, and, prussian, troops, entered, the, commonwealth, and, the, partition, treaty, was, signed, during, the, grodno, sejm, on, january, 23, 1793, without, austria, the, third, partition, took, place, on, october, 24, 1795, in, reaction, to, the, unsuccessful, polish, ko, ciuszko, uprising, the, previous, year, with, this, partition, the, commonwealth, ceased, to, exist, in, english, the, term, partitions, of, poland, is, sometimes, used, geographically, as, toponymy, to, mean, the, three, parts, that, the, partitioning, powers, divided, the, commonwealth, into, namely, the, austrian, partition, the, prussian, partition, and, the, russian, partition, in, polish, there, are, two, separate, words, for, the, two, meanings, the, consecutive, acts, of, dividing, and, annexation, of, poland, are, referred, to, as, rozbi, r, plural, rozbiory, while, the, term, zab, r, plural, zabory, refers, to, parts, of, the, commonwealth, that, were, annexed, in, 1772, 1795, and, which, became, part, of, imperial, russia, prussia, or, austria, following, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, the, borders, of, the, three, partitioned, sectors, were, redrawn, the, austrians, established, galicia, in, the, austrian, partition, whereas, the, russians, gained, warsaw, from, prussia, and, formed, an, autonomous, polity, known, as, congress, poland, in, the, russian, partition, in, polish, historiography, the, term, fourth, partition, of, poland, has, also, been, used, in, reference, to, any, subsequent, annexation, of, polish, lands, by, foreign, invaders, depending, on, source, and, historical, period, this, could, mean, the, events, of, 1815, or, 1832, and, 1846, or, 1939, the, term, fourth, partition, in, a, temporal, sense, can, also, mean, the, diaspora, communities, that, played, an, important, political, role, in, re, establishing, the, polish, sovereign, state, after, 1918, during, the, reign, of, w, adys, aw, iv, 1632, 1648, the, liberum, veto, was, developed, a, policy, of, parliamentary, procedure, based, on, the, assumption, of, the, political, equality, of, every, gentleman, polish, nobleman, with, the, corollary, that, unanimous, consent, was, needed, for, all, measures, a, single, member, of, parliament, s, belief, that, a, measure, was, injurious, to, his, own, constituency, usually, simply, his, own, estate, even, after, the, act, had, been, approved, became, enough, to, strike, the, act, thus, it, became, increasingly, difficult, to, undertake, action, the, liberum, veto, also, provided, openings, for, foreign, diplomats, to, get, their, ways, through, bribing, nobles, to, exercise, it, thus, one, could, characterise, poland, lithuania, in, its, final, period, mid, 18th, century, before, the, partitions, as, already, in, a, state, of, disorder, and, not, a, completely, sovereign, state, and, almost, as, a, vassal, state, with, polish, kings, effectively, chosen, in, diplomatic, maneuvers, between, the, great, powers, prussia, austria, russia, and, france, this, applies, particularly, to, the, last, commonwealth, king, stanis, aw, august, poniatowski, who, for, some, time, had, been, a, lover, of, russian, empress, catherine, the, great, in, 1730, the, neighbors, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, rzeczpospolita, namely, prussia, austria, and, russia, signed, a, secret, agreement, to, maintain, the, status, quo, specifically, to, ensure, that, the, commonwealth, laws, would, not, change, their, alliance, later, became, known, in, poland, as, the, alliance, of, the, three, black, eagles, or, l, wenwolde, s, treaty, because, all, three, states, used, a, black, eagle, as, a, state, symbol, in, contrast, to, the, white, eagle, a, symbol, of, poland, the, commonwealth, had, been, forced, to, rely, on, russia, for, protection, against, the, rising, kingdom, of, prussia, which, demanded, a, slice, of, the, northwest, in, order, to, unite, its, western, and, eastern, portions, this, would, leave, the, commonwealth, with, a, baltic, coast, only, in, latvia, and, lithuania, catherine, had, to, use, diplomacy, to, win, austria, to, her, side, the, commonwealth, had, remained, neutral, in, the, seven, years, war, 1756, 1763, yet, it, sympathized, with, the, alliance, of, france, austria, and, russia, and, allowed, russian, troops, access, to, its, western, lands, as, bases, against, prussia, frederick, ii, retaliated, by, ordering, enough, polish, currency, counterfeited, to, severely, affect, the, polish, economy, through, the, polish, nobles, whom, russia, controlled, and, the, russian, minister, to, warsaw, ambassador, and, prince, nicholas, repnin, empress, catherine, the, great, forced, a, constitution, on, the, commonwealth, at, the, so, called, repnin, sejm, of, 1767, named, after, ambassador, repnin, who, effectively, dictated, the, terms, of, that, sejm, and, ordered, the, capture, and, exile, to, kaluga, of, some, vocal, opponents, of, his, policies, including, bishop, j, zef, andrzej, za, uski, and, others, this, new, constitution, undid, the, reforms, made, in, 1764, under, stanis, aw, ii, the, liberum, veto, and, all, the, old, abuses, of, the, last, one, and, a, half, centuries, were, guaranteed, as, unalterable, parts, of, this, new, constitution, in, the, so, called, cardinal, laws, repnin, also, demanded, the, russian, protection, of, the, rights, of, peasants, in, private, estates, of, polish, and, lithuanian, noblemen, religious, freedom, for, the, protestant, and, orthodox, christians, and, the, political, freedoms, for, protestants, orthodox, christians, and, eastern, catholics, uniates, including, their, right, to, occupy, all, state, positions, including, a, royal, one, the, next, king, could, be, a, member, of, the, russian, ruling, dynasty, now, the, sejm, approved, this, resulting, reaction, among, some, of, poland, s, roman, catholics, as, well, as, the, deep, resentment, of, russian, intervention, in, the, commonwealth, s, domestic, affairs, including, the, exile, to, russia, of, the, top, roman, catholic, bishops, the, members, of, the, polish, senate, led, to, the, war, of, the, confederation, of, bar, of, 1768, 1772, formed, in, bar, where, the, poles, tried, to, expel, russian, forces, from, commonwealth, territory, the, irregular, and, poorly, commanded, polish, forces, had, little, chance, in, the, face, of, the, regular, russian, army, and, suffered, a, major, defeat, adding, to, the, chaos, was, a, ukrainian, cossack, and, peasant, rebellion, in, the, east, koliyivshchyna, which, erupted, in, 1768, and, resulted, in, massacres, of, polish, noblemen, szlachta, jews, uniates, ethnic, minorities, and, catholic, priests, before, it, was, put, down, by, russian, and, governmental, polish, troops, this, uprising, led, to, the, intervention, of, the, ottoman, empire, supported, by, roman, catholic, france, and, austria, bar, confederation, and, france, promised, podolia, and, volhynia, and, the, protectorate, over, the, commonwealth, to, the, ottoman, empire, for, armed, support, in, 1769, the, habsburg, monarchy, annexed, a, small, territory, of, spisz, and, in, 1770, it, annexed, nowy, s, cz, and, nowy, targ, these, territories, had, been, a, bone, of, contention, between, poland, and, hungary, which, was, a, part, of, the, monarchy, nevertheless, the, ottoman, empire, the, bar, confederation, and, its, french, and, european, volunteers, were, defeated, by, russian, forces, and, polish, governmental, ones, with, the, aid, of, great, britain, as, russia, moved, into, the, crimea, and, the, danubian, principalities, which, the, habsburg, monarchy, long, coveted, king, frederick, ii, of, prussia, and, maria, theresa, were, worried, that, the, defeat, of, the, ottoman, empire, would, severely, upset, the, balance, of, power, in, eastern, europe, frederick, ii, began, to, construct, the, partition, to, rebalance, the, power, in, eastern, europe, in, february, 1772, the, agreement, of, partition, was, signed, in, vienna, early, in, august, russian, prussian, and, austrian, troops, occupied, the, provinces, agreed, upon, among, themselves, however, fighting, continued, as, bar, confederation, troops, and, french, volunteers, refused, to, lay, down, their, arms, most, notably, in, tyniec, cz, stochowa, and, krak, w, on, august, 5, 1772, the, occupation, manifesto, was, issued, to, the, dismay, of, the, weak, and, exhausted, polish, state, the, partition, treaty, was, ratified, by, its, signatories, on, september, 22, 1772, frederick, ii, of, prussia, was, elated, with, his, success, prussia, took, most, of, royal, prussia, except, gda, sk, that, stood, between, its, possessions, in, prussia, and, the, margraviate, of, brandenburg, as, well, as, ermland, warmia, northern, areas, of, greater, poland, along, the, note, river, the, netze, district, and, parts, of, kuyavia, but, not, the, city, of, toru, despite, token, criticism, of, the, partition, from, empress, maria, theresa, austrian, statesman, wenzel, anton, prince, of, kaunitz, rietberg, was, proud, of, wresting, as, large, a, share, as, he, did, with, the, rich, salt, mines, of, bochnia, and, wieliczka, to, austria, fell, zator, and, auschwitz, o, wi, cim, part, of, lesser, poland, embracing, parts, of, the, counties, of, krak, w, and, sandomir, and, the, whole, of, galicia, less, the, city, of, krak, w, empress, catherine, ii, of, russia, was, also, satisfied, despite, the, loss, of, galicia, to, the, habsburg, monarchy, by, this, diplomatic, document, russia, gained, polish, livonia, and, lands, in, eastern, belarus, embracing, the, counties, of, vitebsk, polotsk, and, mstislavl, by, this, partition, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, lost, about, 30, of, its, territory, and, half, of, its, population, four, million, people, of, which, a, large, portion, had, not, been, ethnically, polish, by, seizing, northwestern, poland, prussia, instantly, gained, control, over, 80, of, the, commonwealth, s, total, foreign, trade, through, levying, enormous, customs, duties, prussia, accelerated, the, collapse, of, the, commonwealth, after, having, occupied, their, respective, territories, the, three, partitioning, powers, demanded, that, king, stanis, aw, and, the, sejm, approve, their, action, when, no, help, was, forthcoming, and, the, armies, of, the, combined, nations, occupied, warsaw, to, compel, by, force, of, arms, the, calling, of, the, assembly, the, only, alternative, was, passive, submission, to, their, will, the, so, called, partition, sejm, with, russian, military, forces, threatening, the, opposition, on, september, 18, 1773, signed, the, treaty, of, cession, renouncing, all, claims, of, the, commonwealth, to, the, occupied, territories, in, 1772, jean, jacques, rousseau, was, invited, to, present, recommendations, for, a, new, constitution, for, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, resulting, in, the, considerations, on, the, government, of, poland, 1782, which, was, to, be, his, last, major, political, work, by, 1790, the, commonwealth, had, been, weakened, to, such, a, degree, that, it, was, forced, into, an, unnatural, and, terminal, alliance, with, its, enemy, prussia, the, polish, prussian, pact, of, 1790, was, signed, the, conditions, of, the, pact, contributed, to, the, subsequent, final, two, partitions, of, poland, lithuania, the, may, constitution, of, 1791, enfranchised, the, bourgeoisie, established, the, separation, of, the, three, branches, of, government, and, eliminated, the, abuses, of, the, repnin, sejm, those, reforms, prompted, aggressive, actions, on, the, part, of, its, neighbours, wary, of, the, potential, renaissance, of, the, commonwealth, arguing, that, poland, had, fallen, prey, to, the, radical, jacobinism, then, at, high, tide, in, france, russian, forces, invaded, the, commonwealth, in, 1792, in, the, war, in, defense, of, the, constitution, pro, russian, conservative, polish, magnates, the, confederation, of, targowica, fought, against, polish, forces, supporting, the, constitution, believing, that, russians, would, help, them, restore, the, golden, liberty, abandoned, by, their, prussian, allies, polish, pro, constitution, forces, faced, with, targowica, units, and, the, regular, russian, army, were, defeated, prussia, signed, a, treaty, with, russia, agreeing, that, polish, reforms, would, be, revoked, and, both, countries, would, receive, chunks, of, commonwealth, territory, in, 1793, deputies, to, the, grodno, sejm, last, sejm, of, the, commonwealth, in, the, presence, of, the, russian, forces, agreed, to, russian, territorial, demands, in, the, second, partition, russia, and, prussia, helped, themselves, to, enough, land, so, that, only, one, third, of, the, 1772, population, remained, in, poland, prussia, named, its, newly, gained, province, south, prussia, with, pozna, and, later, warsaw, as, the, capital, of, the, new, province, targowica, confederates, who, did, not, expect, another, partition, and, the, king, stanis, aw, august, poniatowski, who, joined, them, near, the, end, both, lost, much, prestige, and, support, the, reformers, on, the, other, hand, were, attracting, increasing, support, and, in, 1794, the, ko, ciuszko, uprising, began, kosciuszko, s, ragtag, insurgent, armies, won, some, initial, successes, but, they, eventually, fell, before, the, superior, forces, of, the, russian, empire, the, partitioning, powers, seeing, the, increasing, unrest, in, the, remaining, commonwealth, decided, to, solve, the, problem, by, erasing, any, independent, polish, state, from, the, map, on, october, 24, 1795, their, representatives, signed, a, treaty, dividing, the, remaining, territories, of, the, commonwealth, between, their, three, countries, one, of, russia, s, chief, foreign, policy, authors, alexander, bezborodko, advised, catherine, ii, on, the, second, and, third, partitions, of, poland, the, russian, part, included, 120, 000, km, 2, 46, 332, sq, mi, and, 1, 2, million, people, with, vilnius, the, prussian, part, new, provinces, of, new, east, prussia, and, new, silesia, 55, 000, km, 2, 21, 236, sq, mi, and, 1, million, people, with, warsaw, and, the, austrian, 47, 000, km,

on, november, 25, 1795, next, he, left, for, saint, petersburg, russia, where, he, would, spend, his, remaining, days, this, act, ensured, that, russia, would, be, seen, as, the, most, important, of, the, partitioning, powers, with, regard, to, population, in, the, first, partition, poland, lost, over, four, to, five, million, citizens, about, a, third, of, its, population, of, 14, million, before, the, partitions, only, about, 4, million, people, remained, in, poland, after, the, second, partition, which, makes, for, a, loss, of, another, third, of, its, original, population, about, a, half, of, the, remaining, population, by, the, third, partition, prussia, ended, up, with, about, 23, of, the, commonwealth, s, population, austria, with, 32, and, russia, with, 45, wandycz, also, offers, slightly, different, total, annexed, territory, estimates, with, 18, for, austria, 20, for, prussia, and, 62, for, russia, during, the, napoleonic, wars, and, in, their, immediate, aftermath, the, borders, between, partitioning, powers, shifted, several, times, changing, the, numbers, seen, in, the, preceding, table, ultimately, russia, ended, up, with, most, of, the, polish, core, at, the, expense, of, prussia, and, austria, following, the, congress, of, vienna, russia, controlled, 82, of, the, pre, 1772, commonwealth, s, territory, this, includes, its, puppet, state, of, congress, poland, austria, 11, and, prussia, 7, as, a, result, of, the, partitions, poles, were, forced, to, seek, a, change, of, status, quo, in, europe, polish, poets, politicians, noblemen, writers, artists, many, of, whom, were, forced, to, emigrate, thus, the, term, great, emigration, became, the, revolutionaries, of, the, 19th, century, as, desire, for, freedom, became, one, of, the, defining, parts, of, polish, romanticism, polish, revolutionaries, participated, in, uprisings, in, prussia, the, austrian, empire, and, imperial, russia, polish, legions, fought, alongside, napoleon, and, under, the, slogan, of, for, our, freedom, and, yours, participated, widely, in, the, spring, of, nations, particularly, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1848, poland, would, be, briefly, resurrected, if, in, a, smaller, frame, in, 1807, when, napoleon, set, up, the, duchy, of, warsaw, after, his, defeat, and, the, implementation, of, the, congress, of, vienna, treaty, in, 1815, the, russian, dominated, congress, kingdom, of, poland, was, created, in, its, place, after, the, congress, russia, gained, a, larger, share, of, poland, with, warsaw, and, after, crushing, an, insurrection, in, 1831, the, congress, kingdom, s, autonomy, was, abolished, and, poles, faced, confiscation, of, property, deportation, forced, military, service, and, the, closure, of, their, own, universities, after, the, uprising, of, 1863, russification, of, polish, secondary, schools, was, imposed, and, the, literacy, rate, dropped, dramatically, in, the, austrian, sector, which, now, was, called, galicia, poles, fared, better, and, were, allowed, to, have, representation, in, parliament, and, to, form, their, own, universities, and, krak, w, with, lemberg, lw, w, lviv, became, centers, of, polish, culture, and, education, meanwhile, prussia, germanized, the, entire, school, system, of, its, polish, subjects, and, had, no, more, respect, for, polish, culture, and, institutions, than, the, russian, empire, in, 1915, a, client, state, of, the, german, empire, and, austria, hungary, was, proposed, and, accepted, by, the, central, powers, of, world, war, i, the, regency, kingdom, of, poland, after, the, end, of, world, war, i, the, central, powers, surrender, to, the, western, allies, the, chaos, of, the, russian, revolution, and, the, treaty, of, versailles, finally, allowed, and, helped, the, restoration, of, poland, s, full, independence, after, 123, years, the, term, fourth, partition, of, poland, may, refer, to, any, subsequent, division, of, polish, lands, including, if, one, accepts, more, than, one, of, those, events, as, partitions, fifth, sixth, and, even, seventh, partitions, can, be, counted, but, these, terms, are, very, rare, for, example, norman, davies, in, god, s, playground, refers, to, the, 1807, creation, of, the, duchy, of, warsaw, as, the, fourth, partition, the, 1815, treaty, of, vienna, as, the, fifth, the, 1918, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, as, the, sixth, and, the, 1939, division, of, poland, between, nazi, germany, and, the, ussr, as, the, seventh, however, in, recent, times, the, 1815, division, of, the, duchy, of, warsaw, at, the, congress, of, vienna, and, the, 1939, division, of, poland, have, been, sometimes, called, the, fourth, and, fifth, partitions, respectively, the, term, fourth, partition, was, also, used, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, to, refer, to, diaspora, communities, who, maintained, a, close, interest, in, the, project, of, regaining, polish, independence, sometimes, termed, polonia, these, expatriate, communities, often, contributed, funding, and, military, support, to, the, project, of, regaining, the, polish, nation, state, diaspora, politics, were, deeply, affected, by, developments, in, and, around, the, homeland, and, vice, versa, for, many, decades, more, recent, studies, claim, that, partitions, happened, when, the, commonwealth, had, been, showing, the, beginning, signs, of, a, slow, recovery, and, see, the, last, two, partitions, as, an, answer, to, strengthening, reforms, in, the, commonwealth, and, the, potential, threat, they, represented, to, its, power, hungry, neighbours, as, historian, norman, davies, stated, because, the, balance, of, power, equilibrium, was, observed, many, contemporary, observers, accepted, explanations, of, the, enlightened, apologists, of, the, partitioning, state, 19th, century, historians, from, countries, that, carried, out, the, partitions, such, as, 19th, century, russian, scholar, sergey, solovyov, and, their, 20th, century, followers, argued, that, partitions, were, justified, as, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, had, degenerated, to, the, point, of, being, partitioned, because, the, counterproductive, principle, of, liberum, veto, made, decision, making, on, divisive, issues, such, as, a, wide, scale, social, reform, virtually, impossible, solovyov, specified, the, cultural, language, and, religious, break, between, the, supreme, and, lowest, layers, of, the, society, in, the, east, regions, of, the, commonwealth, where, the, belarusian, and, ukrainian, serf, peasantry, was, orthodox, russian, authors, emphasized, the, historical, connections, between, belarus, ukraine, and, russia, as, former, parts, of, the, medieval, old, russian, state, where, dynasty, of, rurikids, reigned, kievan, rus, thus, nikolay, karamzin, wrote, let, the, foreigners, denounce, the, partition, of, poland, we, took, what, was, ours, russian, historians, often, stressed, that, russia, annexed, primarily, ukrainian, and, belarusian, provinces, with, eastern, slavic, inhabitants, although, many, ruthenians, were, no, more, enthusiastic, about, russia, than, about, poland, and, ignoring, ethnically, polish, and, lithuanian, territories, also, being, annexed, later, a, new, justification, for, partitions, arose, with, the, russian, enlightenment, as, russian, writers, such, as, gavrila, derzhavin, denis, fonvizin, and, alexander, pushkin, stressed, degeneration, of, catholic, poland, and, the, need, to, civilize, it, by, its, neighbors, nonetheless, other, 19th, century, contemporaries, were, much, more, skeptical, for, example, british, jurist, sir, robert, phillimore, discussed, the, partition, as, a, violation, of, international, law, german, jurist, heinrich, bernhard, oppenheim, presented, similar, views, other, older, historians, who, challenged, such, justifications, for, the, partitions, included, french, historian, jules, michelet, british, historian, and, politician, thomas, babington, macaulay, and, edmund, burke, who, criticized, the, immorality, of, the, partitions, nonetheless, most, governments, accepted, the, event, as, a, fait, acompli, the, ottoman, empire, was, either, the, only, or, one, of, only, two, countries, in, the, world, that, refused, to, accept, the, partitions, the, other, being, the, persian, empire, and, reserved, a, place, in, its, diplomatic, corps, for, an, ambassador, of, lehistan, poland, several, scholars, focused, on, the, economic, motivations, of, the, partitioning, powers, hajo, holborn, noted, that, prussia, aimed, to, take, control, of, the, lucrative, baltic, grain, trade, through, gda, sk, in, the, 18th, century, the, russian, peasants, were, escaping, from, russia, to, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, where, the, once, dire, conditions, had, improved, unlike, in, russia, in, significant, enough, numbers, to, become, a, major, concern, for, the, russian, government, sufficient, to, play, a, role, in, its, decision, to, partition, the, commonwealth, one, of, the, reasons, catherine, ii, gave, for, the, partition, of, poland, was, that, thousands, of, peasants, escaped, from, russia, to, poland, to, seek, a, better, fate, jerzy, czajewski, and, piotr, kimla, assert, that, in, the, 18th, century, until, the, partitions, solved, this, problem, russian, armies, increasingly, raided, territories, of, the, commonwealth, officially, to, recover, the, escapees, but, in, fact, kidnapping, many, locals, piotr, kimla, noted, that, the, russian, government, spread, international, propaganda, mainly, in, france, which, falsely, exaggerated, serfdom, conditions, in, poland, while, ignoring, worse, conditions, in, russia, as, one, of, the, justification, for, the, partitions, il, canto, degli, italiani, the, italian, national, anthem, contains, a, reference, to, the, partition, the, ongoing, partitions, of, poland, were, a, major, topic, of, discourse, in, the, federalist, papers, where, the, structure, of, the, government, of, poland, and, of, foreign, influence, over, it, is, used, in, several, papers, federalist, no, 14, federalist, no, 19, federalist, no, 22, federalist, no, 39, for, examples, as, a, cautionary, tale, for, the, writers, of, the, u, s, constitution
