encompassing, a, variety, of, polities, and, peoples, including, east, slavic, norse, and, finnic, it, was, ruled, by, the, rurik, dynasty, founded, by, the, varangian, prince, rurik, the, name, was, coined, by, russian, historians, in, the, 19th, century, to, describe, the, period, when, kiev, was, at, the, center, at, its, greatest, extent, in, the, mid, 11th, century, kievan, rus, stretched, from, the, white, sea, in, the, north, to, the, black, sea, in, the, south, and, from, the, headwaters, of, the, vistula, in, the, west, to, the, taman, peninsula, in, the, east, uniting, the, east, slavic, tribes, according, to, the, primary, chronicle, the, first, ruler, to, unite, east, slavic, lands, into, what, would, become, kievan, rus, was, oleg, the, wise, r, 879, 912, he, extended, his, control, from, novgorod, south, along, the, dnieper, river, valley, to, protect, trade, from, khazar, incursions, from, the, east, and, took, control, of, the, city, sviatoslav, i, r, 943, 972, achieved, the, first, major, territorial, expansion, of, the, state, fighting, a, war, of, conquest, against, the, khazars, vladimir, the, great, r, 980, 1015, spread, christianity, with, his, own, baptism, and, by, decree, extended, it, to, all, inhabitants, of, kiev, and, beyond, kievan, rus, reached, its, greatest, extent, under, yaroslav, the, wise, r, 1019, 1054, his, sons, assembled, and, issued, its, first, written, legal, code, the, russkaya, pravda, shortly, after, his, death, the, state, began, to, decline, in, the, late, 11th, century, gradually, disintegrating, into, various, rival, regional, powers, throughout, the, 12th, century, it, was, further, weakened, by, external, factors, such, as, the, decline, of, the, byzantine, empire, its, major, economic, partner, and, the, accompanying, diminution, of, trade, routes, through, its, territory, it, finally, fell, to, the, mongol, invasion, in, the, mid, 13th, century, though, the, rurik, dynasty, would, continue, to, rule, until, the, death, of, feodor, i, of, russia, in, 1598, the, modern, nations, of, belarus, russia, and, ukraine, all, claim, kievan, rus, as, their, cultural, ancestor, with, belarus, and, russia, deriving, their, names, from, it, and, the, name, kievan, rus, derived, from, what, is, now, the, capital, of, ukraine, during, its, existence, kievan, rus, was, known, as, the, rus, land, old, east, slavic, romanized, rus, ska, zeml, from, the, ethnonym, rus, medieval, greek, romanized, rhos, arabic, romanized, ar, r, s, in, greek, as, rhosia, in, old, french, as, russie, rossie, in, latin, as, rusia, or, russia, with, local, german, spelling, variants, ruscia, and, ruzzia, and, from, the, 12th, century, also, as, ruthenia, or, rutenia, various, etymologies, have, been, proposed, including, ruotsi, the, finnish, designation, for, sweden, or, ros, a, tribe, from, the, middle, dnieper, valley, region, according, to, the, prevalent, theory, the, name, rus, like, the, proto, finnic, name, for, sweden, rootsi, is, derived, from, an, old, norse, term, for, men, who, row, rods, because, rowing, was, the, main, method, of, navigating, the, rivers, of, eastern, europe, and, could, be, linked, to, the, swedish, coastal, area, of, roslagen, rus, law, or, roden, the, name, rus, would, then, have, the, same, origin, as, the, finnish, and, estonian, names, for, sweden, ruotsi, and, rootsi, when, the, varangian, princes, arrived, the, name, rus, was, associated, with, them, and, came, to, be, associated, with, the, territories, they, controlled, initially, the, cities, of, kiev, chernigov, and, pereyaslavl, and, their, surroundings, came, under, varangian, control, 697, from, the, late, tenth, century, vladimir, the, great, and, yaroslav, the, wise, tried, to, associate, the, name, with, all, of, the, extended, princely, domains, both, meanings, persisted, in, sources, until, the, mongol, conquest, the, narrower, one, referring, to, the, triangular, territory, east, of, the, middle, dnieper, and, the, broader, one, encompassing, all, the, lands, under, the, hegemony, of, kiev, s, grand, princes, the, russian, term, kiyevskaya, rus, russian, was, coined, in, the, 19th, century, in, russian, historiography, to, refer, to, the, period, when, the, centre, was, in, kiev, in, the, 19th, century, it, also, appeared, in, ukrainian, as, kyivska, rus, ukrainian, later, the, russian, term, was, rendered, into, belarusian, as, kiyewskaya, rus, or, kije, skaja, ru, belarusian, and, into, rusyn, as, ky, vska, rus, rusyn, in, english, the, term, was, introduced, in, the, early, 20th, century, when, it, was, found, in, the, 1913, english, translation, of, vasily, klyuchevsky, s, a, history, of, russia, to, distinguish, the, early, polity, from, successor, states, which, were, also, named, rus, the, varangian, rus, from, scandinavia, used, the, old, norse, name, gar, ar, ki, which, according, to, a, common, interpretation, means, land, of, towns, prior, to, the, emergence, of, kievan, rus, in, the, 9th, century, most, of, the, area, north, of, the, black, sea, was, primarily, populated, by, eastern, slavic, tribes, in, the, northern, region, around, novgorod, were, the, ilmen, slavs, and, neighboring, krivichi, who, occupied, territories, surrounding, the, headwaters, of, the, west, dvina, dnieper, and, volga, rivers, to, their, north, in, the, ladoga, and, karelia, regions, were, the, finnic, chud, tribe, in, the, south, in, the, area, around, kiev, were, the, poliane, the, drevliane, to, the, west, of, the, dnieper, and, the, severiane, to, the, east, to, their, north, and, east, were, the, vyatichi, and, to, their, south, was, forested, land, settled, by, slav, farmers, giving, way, to, steppelands, populated, by, nomadic, herdsmen, there, was, once, controversy, over, whether, the, rus, were, varangians, or, slavs, see, anti, normanism, however, more, recently, scholarly, attention, has, focused, more, on, debating, how, quickly, an, ancestrally, norse, people, assimilated, into, slavic, culture, this, uncertainty, is, due, largely, to, a, paucity, of, contemporary, sources, attempts, to, address, this, question, instead, rely, on, archaeological, evidence, the, accounts, of, foreign, observers, and, legends, and, literature, from, centuries, later, to, some, extent, the, controversy, is, related, to, the, foundation, myths, of, modern, states, in, the, region, this, often, unfruitful, debate, over, origins, has, periodically, devolved, into, competing, nationalist, narratives, of, dubious, scholarly, value, being, promoted, directly, by, various, government, bodies, in, a, number, of, states, this, was, seen, in, the, stalinist, period, when, soviet, historiography, sought, to, distance, the, rus, from, any, connection, to, germanic, tribes, in, an, effort, to, dispel, nazi, propaganda, claiming, the, russian, state, owed, its, existence, and, origins, to, the, supposedly, racially, superior, norse, tribes, more, recently, in, the, context, of, resurgent, nationalism, in, post, soviet, states, anglophone, scholarship, has, analyzed, renewed, efforts, to, use, this, debate, to, create, ethno, nationalist, foundation, stories, with, governments, sometimes, directly, involved, in, the, project, conferences, and, publications, questioning, the, norse, origins, of, the, rus, have, been, supported, directly, by, state, policy, in, some, cases, and, the, resultant, foundation, myths, have, been, included, in, some, school, textbooks, in, russia, while, varangians, were, norse, traders, and, vikings, many, russian, and, ukrainian, nationalist, historians, argue, that, the, rus, were, themselves, slavs, normanist, theories, focus, on, the, earliest, written, source, for, the, east, slavs, the, primary, chronicle, which, was, produced, in, the, 12th, century, nationalist, accounts, on, the, other, hand, have, suggested, that, the, rus, were, present, before, the, arrival, of, the, varangians, noting, that, only, a, handful, of, scandinavian, words, can, be, found, in, russian, and, that, scandinavian, names, in, the, early, chronicles, were, soon, replaced, by, slavic, names, nevertheless, the, close, connection, between, the, rus, and, the, norse, is, confirmed, both, by, extensive, scandinavian, settlement, in, belarus, russia, and, ukraine, and, by, slavic, influences, in, the, swedish, language, though, the, debate, over, the, origin, of, the, rus, remains, politically, charged, there, is, broad, agreement, that, if, the, proto, rus, were, indeed, originally, norse, they, were, quickly, nativized, adopting, slavic, languages, and, other, cultural, practices, this, position, roughly, representing, a, scholarly, consensus, at, least, outside, of, nationalist, historiography, was, summarized, by, the, historian, f, donald, logan, in, 839, the, rus, were, swedes, in, 1043, the, rus, were, slavs, ahmad, ibn, fadlan, an, arab, traveler, during, the, 10th, century, provided, one, of, the, earliest, written, descriptions, of, the, rus, they, are, as, tall, as, a, date, palm, blond, and, ruddy, so, that, they, do, not, need, to, wear, a, tunic, nor, a, cloak, rather, the, men, among, them, wear, garments, that, only, cover, half, of, his, body, and, leaves, one, of, his, hands, free, liutprand, of, cremona, who, was, twice, an, envoy, to, the, byzantine, court, 949, and, 968, identifies, the, russi, with, the, norse, the, russi, whom, we, call, norsemen, by, another, name, but, explains, the, name, as, a, greek, term, referring, to, their, physical, traits, a, certain, people, made, up, of, a, part, of, the, norse, whom, the, greeks, call, the, russi, on, account, of, their, physical, features, we, designate, as, norsemen, because, of, the, location, of, their, origin, leo, the, deacon, a, 10th, century, byzantine, historian, and, chronicler, refers, to, the, rus, as, scythians, and, notes, that, they, tended, to, adopt, greek, rituals, and, customs, according, to, the, primary, chronicle, the, territories, of, the, east, slavs, in, the, 9th, century, were, divided, between, the, varangians, and, the, khazars, the, varangians, are, first, mentioned, imposing, tribute, from, slavic, and, finnic, tribes, in, 859, in, 862, various, tribes, rebelled, against, the, varangians, driving, them, back, beyond, the, sea, and, refusing, them, further, tribute, set, out, to, govern, themselves, they, said, to, themselves, let, us, seek, a, prince, who, may, rule, over, us, and, judge, us, according, to, the, law, they, accordingly, went, overseas, to, the, varangian, rus, the, chuds, the, slavs, the, krivichs, and, the, ves, then, said, to, the, rus, our, land, is, great, and, rich, but, there, is, no, order, in, it, come, to, rule, and, reign, over, us, they, thus, selected, three, brothers, with, their, kinfolk, who, took, with, them, all, the, rus, and, migrated, modern, scholars, find, this, an, unlikely, series, of, events, probably, made, up, by, the, 12th, century, orthodox, priests, who, authored, the, chronicle, as, an, explanation, how, the, vikings, managed, to, conquer, the, lands, along, the, varangian, route, so, easily, as, well, as, to, support, the, legitimacy, of, the, rurikid, dynasty, the, three, brothers, rurik, sineus, and, truvor, supposedly, established, themselves, in, novgorod, beloozero, and, izborsk, respectively, two, of, the, brothers, died, and, rurik, became, the, sole, ruler, of, the, territory, and, progenitor, of, the, rurik, dynasty, a, short, time, later, two, of, rurik, s, men, askold, and, dir, asked, him, for, permission, to, go, to, tsargrad, constantinople, on, their, way, south, they, came, upon, a, small, city, on, a, hill, kiev, which, was, a, tributary, of, the, khazars, at, the, time, stayed, there, and, established, their, dominion, over, the, country, of, the, polyanians, the, primary, chronicle, reports, that, askold, and, dir, continued, to, constantinople, with, a, navy, to, attack, the, city, in, 863, 66, catching, the, byzantines, by, surprise, and, ravaging, the, surrounding, area, though, other, accounts, date, the, attack, in, 860, patriarch, photius, vividly, describes, the, universal, devastation, of, the, suburbs, and, nearby, islands, and, another, account, further, details, the, destruction, and, slaughter, of, the, invasion, the, rus, turned, back, before, attacking, the, city, itself, due, either, to, a, storm, dispersing, their, boats, the, return, of, the, emperor, or, in, a, later, account, due, to, a, miracle, after, a, ceremonial, appeal, by, the, patriarch, and, the, emperor, to, the, virgin, the, attack, was, the, first, encounter, between, the, rus, and, byzantines, and, led, the, patriarch, to, send, missionaries, north, to, engage, and, attempt, to, convert, the, rus, and, the, slavs, rurik, led, the, rus, until, his, death, in, about, 879, or, 882, bequeathing, his, kingdom, to, his, kinsman, prince, oleg, as, regent, for, his, young, son, igor, according, to, the, primary, chronicle, in, 880, 82, oleg, led, a, military, force, south, along, the, dnieper, river, capturing, smolensk, and, lyubech, before, reaching, kiev, where, he, deposed, and, killed, askold, and, dir, oleg, set, himself, up, as, prince, in, kiev, and, declared, that, it, should, be, the, mother, of, rus, cities, oleg, set, about, consolidating, his, power, over, the, surrounding, region, and, the, riverways, north, to, novgorod, imposing, tribute, on, the, east, slav, tribes, in, 883, he, conquered, the, drevlians, imposing, a, fur, tribute, on, them, by, 885, he, had, subjugated, the, poliane, severiane, vyatichi, and, radimichs, forbidding, them, to, pay, further, tribute, to, the, khazars, oleg, continued, to, develop, and, expand, a, network, of, rus, forts, in, slavic, lands, begun, by, rurik, in, the, north, the, new, kievan, state, prospered, due, to, its, abundant, supply, of, furs, beeswax, honey, and, slaves, for, export, and, because, it, controlled, three, main, trade, routes, of, eastern, europe, in, the, north, novgorod, served, as, a, commercial, link, between, the, baltic, sea, and, the, volga, trade, route, to, the, lands, of, the, volga, bulgars, the, khazars, and, across, the, caspian, sea, as, far, as, baghdad, providing, access, to, markets, and, products, from, central, asia, and, the, middle, east, trade, from, the, baltic, also, moved, south, on, a, network, of, rivers, and, short, portages, along, the, dnieper, known, as, the, route, from, the, varangians, to, the, greeks, continuing, to, the, black, sea, and, on, to, constantinople, kiev, was, a, central, outpost, along, the, dnieper, route, and, a, hub, with, the, east, west, overland, trade, route, between, the, khazars, and, the, germanic, lands, of, central, europe, and, may, have, been, a, staging, post, for, radhanite, jewish, traders, between, western, europe, itil, and, china, these, commercial, connections, enriched, rus, merchants, and, princes, funding, military, forces, and, the, construction, of, churches, palaces, fortifications, and, further, towns, demand, for, luxury, goods, fostered, production, of, expensive, jewelry, and, religious, wares, allowing, their, export, and, an, advanced, credit, and, money, lending, system, may, have, also, been, in, place, the, rapid, expansion, of, the, rus, to, the, south, led, to, conflict, and, volatile, relationships, with, the, khazars, and, other, neighbors, on, the, pontic, steppe, the, khazars, dominated, trade, from, the, volga, don, steppes, to, eastern, crimea, and, the, northern, caucasus, during, the, 8th, century, an, era, historians, call, the, pax, khazarica, trading, and, frequently, allying, with, the, byzantine, empire, against, persians, and, arabs, in, the, late, 8th, century, the, collapse, of, the, g, kt, rk, khaganate, led, the, magyars, and, the, pechenegs, ugrians, and, turkic, peoples, from, central, asia, to, migrate, west, into, the, steppe, region, leading, to, military, conflict, disruption, of, trade, and, instability, within, the, khazar, khaganate, the, rus, and, slavs, had, earlier, allied, with, the, khazars, against, arab, raids, on, the, caucasus, but, they, increasingly, worked, against, them, to, secure, control, of, the, trade, routes, the, byzantine, empire, was, able, to, take, advantage, of, the, turmoil, to, expand, its, political, influence, and, commercial, relationships, first, with, the, khazars, and, later, with, the, rus, and, other, steppe, groups, the, byzantines, established, the, theme, of, cherson, formally, known, as, klimata, in, the, crimea, in, the, 830s, to, defend, against, raids, by, the, rus, and, to, protect, vital, grain, shipments, supplying, constantinople, cherson, also, served, as, a, key, diplomatic, link, with, the, khazars, and, others, on, the, steppe, and, it, became, the, centre, of, black, sea, commerce, the, byzantines, also, helped, the, khazars, build, a, fortress, at, sarkel, on, the, don, river, to, protect, their, northwest, frontier, against, incursions, by, the, turkic, migrants, and, the, rus, and, to, control, caravan, trade, routes, and, the, portage, between, the, don, and, volga, rivers, the, expansion, of, the, rus, put, further, military, and, economic, pressure, on, the, khazars, depriving, them, of, territory, tributaries, and, trade, in, around, 890, oleg, waged, an, indecisive, war, in, the, lands, of, the, lower, dniester, and, dnieper, rivers, with, the, tivertsi, and, the, ulichs, who, were, likely, acting, as, vassals, of, the, magyars, blocking, rus, access, to, the, black, sea, in, 894, the, magyars, and, pechenegs, were, drawn, into, the, wars, between, the, byzantines, and, the, bulgarian, empire, the, byzantines, arranged, for, the, magyars, to, attack, bulgarian, territory, from, the, north, and, bulgaria, in, turn, persuaded, the, pechenegs, to, attack, the, magyars, from, their, rear, boxed, in, the, magyars, were, forced, to, migrate, further, west, across, the, carpathian, mountains, into, the, hungarian, plain, depriving, the, khazars, of, an, important, ally, and, a, buffer, from, the, rus, the, migration, of, the, magyars, allowed, access, for, the, rus, to, the, black, sea, and, they, soon, launched, excursions, into, khazar, territory, along, the, sea, coast, up, the, don, river, and, into, the, lower, volga, region, the, rus, were, raiding, and, plundering, into, the, caspian, sea, region, from, 864, with, the, first, large, scale, expedition, in, 913, when, they, extensively, raided, baku, gilan, mazandaran, and, penetrated, into, the, caucasus, as, the, 10th, century, progressed, the, khazars, were, no, longer, able, to, command, tribute, from, the, volga, bulgars, and, their, relationship, with, the, byzantines, deteriorated, as, byzantium, increasingly, allied, with, the, pechenegs, against, them, the, pechenegs, were, thus, secure, to, raid, the, lands, of, the, khazars, from, their, base, between, the, volga, and, don, rivers, allowing, them, to, expand, to, the, west, relations, between, the, rus, and, pechenegs, were, complex, as, the, groups, alternately, formed, alliances, with, and, against, one, another, the, pechenegs, were, nomads, roaming, the, steppe, raising, livestock, which, they, traded, with, the, rus, for, agricultural, goods, and, other, products, the, lucrative, rus, trade, with, the, byzantine, empire, had, to, pass, through, pecheneg, controlled, territory, so, the, need, for, generally, peaceful, relations, was, essential, nevertheless, while, the, primary, chronicle, reports, the, pechenegs, entering, rus, territory, in, 915, and, then, making, peace, they, were, waging, war, with, one, another, again, in, 920, pechenegs, are, reported, assisting, the, rus, in, later, campaigns, against, the, byzantines, yet, allied, with, the, byzantines, against, the, rus, at, other, times, after, the, rus, attack, on, constantinople, in, 860, the, byzantine, patriarch, photius, sent, missionaries, north, to, convert, the, rus, and, the, slavs, to, christianity, prince, rastislav, of, moravia, had, requested, the, emperor, to, provide, teachers, to, interpret, the, holy, scriptures, so, in, 863, the, brothers, cyril, and, methodius, were, sent, as, missionaries, due, to, their, knowledge, of, the, slavonic, language, the, slavs, had, no, written, language, so, the, brothers, devised, the, glagolitic, alphabet, later, replaced, by, cyrillic, developed, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, and, standardized, the, language, of, the, slavs, later, known, as, old, church, slavonic, they, translated, portions, of, the, bible, and, drafted, the, first, slavic, civil, code, and, other, documents, and, the, language, and, texts, spread, throughout, slavic, territories, including, kievan, rus, the, mission, of, cyril, and, methodius, served, both, evangelical, and, diplomatic, purposes, spreading, byzantine, cultural, influence, in, support, of, imperial, foreign, policy, in, 867, the, patriarch, announced, that, the, rus, had, accepted, a, bishop, and, in, 874, he, speaks, of, an, archbishop, of, the, rus, relations, between, the, rus, and, byzantines, became, more, complex, after, oleg, took, control, over, kiev, reflecting, commercial, cultural, and, military, concerns, the, wealth, and, income, of, the, rus, depended, heavily, upon, trade, with, byzantium, constantine, porphyrogenitus, described, the, annual, course, of, the, princes, of, kiev, collecting, tribute, from, client, tribes, assembling, the, product, into, a, flotilla, of, hundreds, of, boats, conducting, them, down, the, dnieper, to, the, black, sea, and, sailing, to, the, estuary, of, the, dniester, the, danube, delta, and, on, to, constantinople, on, their, return, trip, they, would, carry, silk, fabrics, spices, wine, and, fruit, the, importance, of, this, trade, relationship, led, to, military, action, when, disputes, arose, the, primary, chronicle, reports, that, the, rus, attacked, constantinople, again, in, 907, probably, to, secure, trade, access, the, chronicle, glorifies, the, military, prowess, and, shrewdness, of, oleg, an, account, imbued, with, legendary, detail, byzantine, sources, do, not, mention, the, attack, but, a, pair, of, treaties, in, 907, and, 911, set, forth, a, trade, agreement, with, the, rus, the, terms, suggesting, pressure, on, the, byzantines, who, granted, the, rus, quarters, and, supplies, for, their, merchants, and, tax, free, trading, privileges, in, constantinople, the, chronicle, provides, a, mythic, tale, of, oleg, s, death, a, sorcerer, prophesies, that, the, death, of, the, prince, would, be, associated, with, a, certain, horse, oleg, has, the, horse, sequestered, and, it, later, dies, oleg, goes, to, visit, the, horse, and, stands, over, the, carcass, gloating, that, he, had, outlived, the, threat, when, a, snake, strikes, him, from, among, the, bones, and, he, soon, becomes, ill, and, dies, the, chronicle, reports, that, prince, igor, succeeded, oleg, in, 913, and, after, some, brief, conflicts, with, the, drevlians, and, the, pechenegs, a, period, of, peace, ensued, for, over, twenty, years, in, 941, igor, led, another, major, rus, attack, on, constantinople, probably, over, trading, rights, again, a, navy, of, 10, 000, vessels, including, pecheneg, allies, landed, on, the, bithynian, coast, and, devastated, the, asiatic, shore, of, the, bosphorus, the, attack, was, well, timed, perhaps, due, to, intelligence, as, the, byzantine, fleet, was, occupied, with, the, arabs, in, the, mediterranean, and, the, bulk, of, its, army, was, stationed, in, the, east, the, rus, burned, towns, churches, and, monasteries, butchering, the, people, and, amassing, booty, the, emperor, arranged, for, a, small, group, of, retired, ships, to, be, outfitted, with, greek, fire, throwers, and, sent, them, out, to, meet, the, rus, luring, them, into, surrounding, the, contingent, before, unleashing, the, greek, fire, liutprand, of, cremona, wrote, that, the, rus, seeing, the, flames, jumped, overboard, preferring, water, to, fire, some, sank, weighed, down, by, the, weight, of, their, breastplates, and,

atrocities, reported, as, victims, were, crucified, and, set, up, for, use, as, targets, at, last, a, byzantine, army, arrived, from, the, balkans, to, drive, the, rus, back, and, a, naval, contingent, reportedly, destroyed, much, of, the, rus, fleet, on, its, return, voyage, possibly, an, exaggeration, since, the, rus, soon, mounted, another, attack, the, outcome, indicates, increased, military, might, by, byzantium, since, 911, suggesting, a, shift, in, the, balance, of, power, igor, returned, to, kiev, keen, for, revenge, he, assembled, a, large, force, of, warriors, from, among, neighboring, slavs, and, pecheneg, allies, and, sent, for, reinforcements, of, varangians, from, beyond, the, sea, in, 944, the, rus, force, advanced, again, on, the, greeks, by, land, and, sea, and, a, byzantine, force, from, cherson, responded, the, emperor, sent, gifts, and, offered, tribute, in, lieu, of, war, and, the, rus, accepted, envoys, were, sent, between, the, rus, the, byzantines, and, the, bulgarians, in, 945, and, a, peace, treaty, was, completed, the, agreement, again, focused, on, trade, but, this, time, with, terms, less, favorable, to, the, rus, including, stringent, regulations, on, the, conduct, of, rus, merchants, in, cherson, and, constantinople, and, specific, punishments, for, violations, of, the, law, the, byzantines, may, have, been, motivated, to, enter, the, treaty, out, of, concern, of, a, prolonged, alliance, of, the, rus, pechenegs, and, bulgarians, against, them, though, the, more, favorable, terms, further, suggest, a, shift, in, power, following, the, death, of, igor, in, 945, his, wife, olga, ruled, as, regent, in, kiev, until, their, son, sviatoslav, reached, maturity, c, 963, his, decade, long, reign, over, kievan, rus, was, marked, by, rapid, expansion, through, the, conquest, of, the, khazars, of, the, pontic, steppe, and, the, invasion, of, the, balkans, by, the, end, of, his, short, life, sviatoslav, carved, out, for, himself, the, largest, state, in, europe, eventually, moving, his, capital, from, kiev, to, pereyaslavets, on, the, danube, in, 969, in, contrast, with, his, mother, s, conversion, to, christianity, sviatoslav, like, his, druzhina, remained, a, staunch, pagan, due, to, his, abrupt, death, in, an, ambush, in, 972, sviatoslav, s, conquests, for, the, most, part, were, not, consolidated, into, a, functioning, empire, while, his, failure, to, establish, a, stable, succession, led, to, a, fratricidal, feud, among, his, sons, which, resulted, in, two, of, his, three, sons, being, killed, it, is, not, clearly, documented, when, the, title, of, grand, prince, was, first, introduced, but, the, importance, of, the, kiev, principality, was, recognized, after, the, death, of, sviatoslav, i, in, 972, and, the, ensuing, struggle, between, vladimir, and, yaropolk, the, region, of, kiev, dominated, the, region, for, the, next, two, centuries, the, grand, prince, or, grand, duke, of, kiev, controlled, the, lands, around, the, city, and, his, formally, subordinate, relatives, ruled, the, other, cities, and, paid, him, tribute, the, zenith, of, the, state, s, power, came, during, the, reigns, of, vladimir, the, great, r, 980, 1015, and, prince, yaroslav, i, the, wise, r, 1019, 1054, both, rulers, continued, the, steady, expansion, of, kievan, rus, that, had, begun, under, oleg, vladimir, had, been, prince, of, novgorod, when, his, father, sviatoslav, i, died, in, 972, but, fled, to, scandinavia, in, 977, after, his, half, brother, yaropolk, killed, his, other, half, brother, oleg, according, to, the, primary, chronicle, vladimir, assembled, a, host, of, varangian, warriors, first, subdued, the, principality, of, polotsk, and, then, defeated, and, killed, yaropolk, thus, establishing, his, reign, over, the, entire, kievan, rus, realm, although, sometimes, solely, attributed, to, vladimir, the, christianization, of, kievan, rus, was, a, long, and, complicated, process, that, began, before, the, state, s, formation, as, early, as, the, 1st, century, ad, greeks, in, the, black, sea, colonies, converted, to, christianity, and, the, primary, chronicle, even, records, the, legend, of, andrew, the, apostle, s, mission, to, these, coastal, settlements, as, well, as, blessing, the, site, of, present, day, kyiv, the, goths, migrated, to, through, the, region, in, the, 3rd, century, adopting, arian, christianity, in, the, 4th, century, leaving, behind, 4th, and, 5th, century, churches, excavated, in, crimea, although, the, hunnic, invasion, of, the, 370s, halted, christianisation, for, several, centuries, some, of, the, earliest, kievan, princes, and, princesses, such, as, askold, and, dir, and, olga, of, kiev, reportedly, converted, to, christianity, but, oleg, igor, and, sviatoslav, remained, pagans, the, primary, chronicle, records, the, legend, that, when, vladimir, had, decided, to, accept, a, new, faith, instead, of, traditional, slavic, paganism, he, sent, out, some, of, his, most, valued, advisors, and, warriors, as, emissaries, to, different, parts, of, europe, they, visited, the, christians, of, the, latin, church, the, jews, and, the, muslims, before, finally, arriving, in, constantinople, they, rejected, islam, because, among, other, things, it, prohibited, the, consumption, of, alcohol, and, judaism, because, the, god, of, the, jews, had, permitted, his, chosen, people, to, be, deprived, of, their, country, they, found, the, ceremonies, in, the, roman, church, to, be, dull, but, at, constantinople, they, were, so, astounded, by, the, beauty, of, the, cathedral, of, hagia, sophia, and, the, liturgical, service, held, there, that, they, made, up, their, minds, there, and, then, about, the, faith, they, would, like, to, follow, upon, their, arrival, home, they, convinced, vladimir, that, the, faith, of, the, byzantine, rite, was, the, best, choice, of, all, upon, which, vladimir, made, a, journey, to, constantinople, and, arranged, to, marry, princess, anna, the, sister, of, byzantine, emperor, basil, ii, historically, it, is, more, likely, that, he, adopted, byzantine, christianity, in, order, to, strengthen, his, diplomatic, relations, with, constantinople, vladimir, s, choice, of, eastern, christianity, may, have, reflected, his, close, personal, ties, with, constantinople, which, dominated, the, black, sea, and, hence, trade, on, kiev, s, most, vital, commercial, route, the, dnieper, river, according, to, the, primary, chronicle, vladimir, was, baptised, in, c, 987, and, ordered, the, population, of, kiev, to, be, baptised, in, august, 988, the, greatest, resistance, against, christianisation, appears, to, have, occurred, in, northern, towns, including, novgorod, suzdal, and, belozersk, adherence, to, the, eastern, church, had, long, range, political, cultural, and, religious, consequences, the, church, had, a, liturgy, written, in, cyrillic, and, a, corpus, of, translations, from, greek, that, had, been, produced, for, the, slavic, peoples, this, literature, facilitated, the, conversion, to, christianity, of, the, eastern, slavs, and, introduced, them, to, rudimentary, greek, philosophy, science, and, historiography, without, the, necessity, of, learning, greek, there, were, some, merchants, who, did, business, with, greeks, and, likely, had, an, understanding, of, contemporary, business, greek, following, the, great, schism, of, 1054, the, kievan, church, maintained, communion, with, both, rome, and, constantinople, for, some, time, but, along, with, most, of, the, eastern, churches, it, eventually, split, to, follow, the, eastern, orthodox, that, being, said, unlike, other, parts, of, the, greek, world, kievan, rus, did, not, have, a, strong, hostility, to, the, western, world, yaroslav, known, as, the, wise, struggled, for, power, with, his, brothers, a, son, of, vladimir, the, great, he, was, prince, of, novgorod, at, the, time, of, his, father, s, death, in, 1015, although, he, first, established, his, rule, over, kiev, in, 1019, he, did, not, have, uncontested, rule, of, all, of, kievan, rus, until, 1036, like, vladimir, yaroslav, was, eager, to, improve, relations, with, the, rest, of, europe, especially, the, byzantine, empire, yaroslav, s, granddaughter, eupraxia, the, daughter, of, his, son, vsevolod, i, was, married, to, henry, iv, holy, roman, emperor, yaroslav, also, arranged, marriages, for, his, sister, and, three, daughters, to, the, kings, of, poland, france, hungary, and, norway, yaroslav, promulgated, the, first, law, code, of, kievan, rus, the, russkaya, pravda, built, saint, sophia, cathedral, in, kiev, and, saint, sophia, cathedral, in, novgorod, patronized, local, clergy, and, monasticism, and, is, said, to, have, founded, a, school, system, yaroslav, s, sons, developed, the, great, kiev, pechersk, lavra, monastery, in, the, centuries, that, followed, the, state, s, foundation, rurik, s, descendants, shared, power, over, kievan, rus, the, means, by, which, royal, power, was, transferred, from, one, rurikid, ruler, to, the, next, is, unclear, however, historian, paul, magocsi, mentioned, that, scholars, have, debated, what, the, actual, system, of, succession, was, or, whether, there, was, any, system, at, all, according, to, historian, nancy, kollmann, the, rota, system, was, used, with, the, princely, succession, moving, from, elder, to, younger, brother, and, from, uncle, to, nephew, as, well, as, from, father, to, son, junior, members, of, the, dynasty, usually, began, their, official, careers, as, rulers, of, a, minor, district, progressed, to, more, lucrative, principalities, and, then, competed, for, the, coveted, throne, of, kiev, whatever, the, case, according, to, professor, ivan, katchanovski, no, adequate, system, of, succession, to, the, kievan, throne, was, developed, after, the, death, of, yaroslav, the, wise, r, 1019, 1054, commencing, a, process, of, gradual, disintegration, the, unconventional, power, succession, system, fomented, constant, hatred, and, rivalry, within, the, royal, family, familicide, was, frequently, deployed, to, obtain, power, and, can, be, traced, particularly, during, the, time, of, the, yaroslavichi, sons, of, yaroslav, when, the, established, succession, system, was, skipped, in, the, establishment, of, vladimir, ii, monomakh, as, the, grand, prince, of, kiev, r, 1113, 1125, in, turn, creating, major, squabbles, between, the, olegovichi, sons, of, oleg, i, from, chernigov, the, monomakhovichi, from, pereyaslavl, the, izyaslavichi, sons, of, iziaslav, from, turov, volhynia, and, the, polotsk, princes, the, position, of, the, grand, prince, of, kiev, was, weakened, by, the, growing, influence, of, regional, clans, the, rival, principality, of, polotsk, was, contesting, the, power, of, the, grand, prince, by, occupying, novgorod, while, rostislav, vladimirovich, was, fighting, for, the, black, sea, port, of, tmutarakan, belonging, to, chernigov, three, of, yaroslav, s, sons, that, first, allied, together, found, themselves, fighting, each, other, especially, after, their, defeat, to, the, cuman, forces, in, 1068, at, the, battle, of, the, alta, river, the, ruling, grand, prince, iziaslav, fled, to, poland, asking, for, support, and, in, a, couple, of, years, returned, to, establish, the, order, the, affairs, became, even, more, complicated, by, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, driving, the, state, into, chaos, and, constant, warfare, on, the, initiative, of, vladimir, ii, monomakh, in, 1097, the, council, of, liubech, of, kievan, rus, took, place, near, chernigov, with, the, main, intention, to, find, an, understanding, among, the, fighting, sides, by, 1130, all, descendants, of, vseslav, the, seer, had, been, exiled, to, the, byzantine, empire, by, mstislav, the, great, the, most, fierce, resistance, to, the, monomakhs, was, posed, by, the, olegovichi, when, the, izgoi, vsevolod, ii, managed, to, become, the, grand, prince, of, kiev, the, rostislavichi, who, had, initially, established, in, the, lands, of, galicia, by, 1189, were, defeated, by, the, monomakh, piast, descendant, roman, the, great, the, decline, of, constantinople, a, main, trading, partner, of, kievan, rus, played, a, significant, role, in, the, decline, of, the, kievan, rus, the, trade, route, from, the, varangians, to, the, greeks, along, which, the, goods, were, moving, from, the, black, sea, mainly, byzantine, through, eastern, europe, to, the, baltic, was, a, cornerstone, of, kievan, wealth, and, prosperity, these, trading, routes, became, less, important, as, the, byzantine, empire, declined, in, power, and, western, europe, created, new, trade, routes, to, asia, and, the, near, east, as, people, relied, less, on, passing, through, the, territories, of, kievan, rus, for, trade, the, economy, of, kievan, rus, suffered, the, last, ruler, to, maintain, a, united, state, was, mstislav, the, great, after, his, death, in, 1132, kievan, rus, fell, into, recession, and, a, rapid, decline, and, mstislav, s, successor, yaropolk, ii, of, kiev, instead, of, focusing, on, the, external, threat, of, the, cumans, was, embroiled, in, conflicts, with, the, growing, power, of, the, novgorod, republic, in, march, 1169, a, coalition, of, native, princes, led, by, andrei, bogolyubsky, of, vladimir, sacked, kiev, this, changed, the, perception, of, kiev, and, was, evidence, of, the, fragmentation, of, the, kievan, rus, by, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, the, kievan, state, fragmented, even, further, into, roughly, twelve, different, principalities, the, crusades, brought, a, shift, in, european, trade, routes, that, accelerated, the, decline, of, kievan, rus, in, 1204, the, forces, of, the, fourth, crusade, sacked, constantinople, making, the, dnieper, trade, route, marginal, at, the, same, time, the, livonian, brothers, of, the, sword, of, the, northern, crusades, were, conquering, the, baltic, region, and, threatening, the, lands, of, novgorod, in, the, north, the, novgorod, republic, prospered, because, it, controlled, trade, routes, from, the, river, volga, to, the, baltic, sea, as, kievan, rus, declined, novgorod, became, more, independent, a, local, oligarchy, ruled, novgorod, major, government, decisions, were, made, by, a, town, assembly, which, also, elected, a, prince, as, the, city, s, military, leader, in, 1136, novgorod, revolted, against, kiev, and, became, independent, now, an, independent, city, republic, and, referred, to, as, lord, novgorod, the, great, it, would, spread, its, mercantile, interest, to, the, west, and, the, north, to, the, baltic, sea, and, the, low, populated, forest, regions, respectively, in, 1199, prince, roman, mstislavych, united, the, two, previously, separate, principalities, of, galicia, and, volhynia, his, son, daniel, r, 1238, 1264, looked, for, support, from, the, west, he, accepted, a, crown, from, the, roman, papacy, following, the, mongol, invasion, of, cumania, or, the, kipchaks, in, which, case, many, cuman, rulers, fled, to, rus, such, as, k, ten, the, state, finally, disintegrated, under, the, pressure, of, the, mongol, invasion, of, kievan, rus, fragmenting, it, into, successor, principalities, who, paid, tribute, to, the, golden, horde, the, so, called, tatar, yoke, just, prior, to, the, mongol, invasion, kievan, rus, had, been, a, relatively, prosperous, region, international, trade, as, well, as, skilled, artisans, flourished, while, its, farms, produced, enough, to, feed, the, urban, population, after, the, invasion, of, the, late, 1230s, the, economy, shattered, and, its, population, were, either, slaughtered, or, sold, into, slavery, while, skilled, laborers, and, artisans, were, sent, to, the, mongol, s, steppe, regions, on, the, southwestern, periphery, kievan, rus, was, succeeded, by, the, principality, of, galicia, volhynia, later, as, these, territories, now, part, of, modern, central, ukraine, and, belarus, fell, to, the, gediminids, the, powerful, largely, ruthenized, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, drew, heavily, on, the, cultural, and, legal, traditions, of, the, rus, from, 1398, until, the, union, of, lublin, in, 1569, its, full, name, was, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, ruthenia, and, samogitia, on, the, north, eastern, periphery, of, kievan, rus, traditions, were, adapted, in, the, vladimir, suzdal, principality, that, gradually, gravitated, towards, moscow, to, the, very, north, the, novgorod, and, pskov, feudal, republics, were, less, autocratic, than, vladimir, suzdal, moscow, until, they, were, absorbed, by, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, modern, historians, from, belarus, russia, and, ukraine, alike, consider, kievan, rus, the, first, period, of, their, modern, countries, histories, the, lands, of, kievan, rus, were, mostly, made, up, of, forests, and, steppes, see, east, european, forest, steppe, and, central, european, mixed, forests, while, its, main, rivers, all, originated, in, the, valdai, hills, the, dnieper, and, primarily, populated, by, slavic, and, finnic, tribes, all, tribes, were, hunter, gatherers, to, a, certain, degree, but, the, slavs, were, primarily, agriculturalists, growing, cereal, grains, and, crops, as, well, as, raising, livestock, before, the, emergence, of, the, kievan, state, these, tribes, had, their, own, leaders, and, gods, and, interaction, between, tribes, was, occasionally, marked, either, by, trading, goods, or, fighting, battles, the, most, valuable, commodities, traded, were, captive, slaves, and, fur, pelts, usually, in, exchange, for, silver, coins, or, oriental, finery, and, common, trade, partners, were, volga, bolghar, khazar, itil, and, byzantine, chersonesus, by, the, early, 9th, century, bands, of, scandinavian, adventurers, known, as, varangians, and, later, rus, started, plundering, various, slavic, villages, in, the, region, later, extracting, tribute, in, exchange, for, protection, against, pillaging, by, other, varangians, over, time, these, relationships, of, tribute, for, protection, evolved, into, more, permanent, political, structures, the, rus, lords, became, princes, and, the, slavic, populace, their, subjects, in, the, early, 10th, century, kievan, rus, mainly, traded, with, other, tribes, in, eastern, europe, and, scandinavia, there, was, little, need, for, complex, social, structures, to, carry, out, these, exchanges, in, the, forests, north, of, the, steppes, so, long, as, the, entrepreneurs, operated, in, small, numbers, and, kept, to, the, north, they, did, not, catch, the, attention, of, observers, or, writers, the, rus, also, had, strong, trading, ties, to, byzantium, particularly, in, the, early, 900s, as, treaties, in, 911, and, 944, indicate, these, treaties, deal, with, the, treatment, of, runaway, byzantine, slaves, and, limitations, on, the, amounts, of, certain, commodities, such, as, silk, that, could, be, bought, from, byzantium, the, rus, used, log, rafts, floated, down, the, dnieper, river, by, slavic, tribes, for, the, transport, of, goods, particularly, slaves, to, byzantium, during, the, kievan, era, trade, and, transport, depended, largely, on, networks, of, rivers, and, portages, by, this, period, trade, networks, had, expanded, to, cater, to, more, than, just, local, demand, this, is, evidenced, by, a, survey, of, glassware, found, in, over, 30, sites, ranging, from, suzdal, drutsk, and, belozeroo, which, found, that, a, substantial, majority, was, manufactured, in, kiev, kiev, was, the, main, depot, and, transit, point, for, trade, between, itself, byzantium, and, the, black, sea, region, even, though, this, trade, network, had, already, been, existent, the, volume, of, which, had, expanded, rapidly, in, the, 11th, century, kiev, was, also, dominant, in, internal, trade, between, the, towns, of, rus, it, held, a, monopoly, on, glassware, products, glass, vessels, glazed, pottery, and, window, glass, up, until, the, early, to, mid, 12th, century, until, which, it, lost, its, monopoly, to, the, other, towns, in, rus, inlaid, enamel, production, techniques, was, borrowed, from, byzantine, byzantine, amphorae, wine, and, olive, oil, have, been, found, along, the, middle, dnieper, suggesting, trade, between, kiev, along, trade, towns, to, byzantium, in, winter, the, ruler, of, kiev, went, out, on, rounds, visiting, dregovichs, krivichs, drevlians, severians, and, other, subordinated, tribes, some, paid, tribute, in, money, some, in, furs, or, other, commodities, and, some, in, slaves, this, system, was, called, poliudie, according, to, martin, 2009, christianity, judaism, and, islam, had, long, been, known, in, these, lands, and, olga, personally, converted, to, christianity, when, vladimir, assumed, the, throne, however, he, set, idols, of, norse, slav, finn, and, iranian, gods, worshipped, by, the, disparate, elements, of, his, society, on, a, hilltop, in, kiev, in, an, attempt, to, create, a, single, pantheon, for, his, people, but, for, reasons, that, remain, unclear, he, soon, abandoned, this, attempt, in, favour, of, christianity, the, architecture, of, kievan, rus, is, the, earliest, period, of, russian, ukrainian, and, belarusian, architecture, using, the, foundations, of, byzantine, culture, but, with, great, use, of, innovations, and, architectural, features, most, remains, are, russian, orthodox, churches, or, parts, of, the, gates, and, fortifications, of, cities, the, east, slavic, lands, were, originally, divided, into, princely, domains, called, zemlias, lands, or, volosts, from, a, term, meaning, power, or, government, a, smaller, clan, sized, unit, was, called, a, verv, or, pogost, headed, by, a, kopa, or, viche, from, the, 11th, to, 13th, centuries, the, principalities, were, divided, into, volosts, its, centre, usually, called, a, pryhorod, or, gord, a, fortified, settlement, a, volost, consisted, of, several, vervs, or, hromadas, commune, or, community, a, local, official, was, called, a, volostel, or, starosta, yaroslav, the, wise, assigned, priority, to, the, major, principalities, to, reduce, familial, conflict, over, succession, not, mentioned, by, yaroslav, were, principality, of, polotsk, ruled, by, yaroslav, s, older, brother, iziaslav, of, polotsk, that, was, to, remain, under, the, control, of, his, descendants, and, the, principality, of, galicia, eventually, taken, by, the, dynasty, of, his, grandson, rostyslav, from, the, 9th, century, on, the, pecheneg, nomads, had, an, uneasy, relationship, with, kievan, rus, for, over, two, centuries, they, launched, sporadic, raids, into, rus, which, sometimes, escalated, into, full, scale, wars, such, as, the, 920, war, on, the, pechenegs, by, igor, of, kiev, reported, in, the, primary, chronicle, but, there, were, also, temporary, military, alliances, e, g, the, 943, byzantine, campaign, by, igor, in, 968, the, pechenegs, attacked, and, besieged, the, city, of, kiev, boniak, was, a, cuman, khan, who, led, a, series, of, invasions, on, kievan, rus, in, 1096, boniak, attacked, kiev, plundered, the, kiev, monastery, of, the, caves, and, burned, down, the, prince, s, palace, in, berestovo, he, was, defeated, in, 1107, by, vladimir, monomakh, oleg, sviatopolk, and, other, princes, of, rus, byzantium, quickly, became, the, main, trading, and, cultural, partner, for, kiev, but, relations, were, not, always, friendly, one, of, the, largest, military, accomplishments, of, the, rurikid, dynasty, was, the, attack, on, byzantium, in, 960, pilgrims, of, the, rus, had, been, making, the, journey, from, kiev, to, constantinople, for, many, years, and, constantine, porphyrogenitus, the, emperor, of, the, byzantine, empire, believed, that, this, gave, them, significant, information, about, the, arduous, parts, of, the, journey, and, where, travelers, were, most, at, risk, as, would, be, pertinent, for, an, invasion, this, route, took, travelers, through, domain, of, the, pechenegs, journeying, mostly, by, river, in, june, 941, the, rus, staged, a, naval, ambush, on, byzantine, forces, making, up, for, their, smaller, numbers, with, small, maneuverable, boats, these, boats, were, ill, equipped, for, the, transportation, of, large, quantities, of, treasure, suggesting, that, looting, was, not, the, goal, the, raid, was, led, according, to, the, primary, chronicle, by, a, king,
