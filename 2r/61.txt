the, 3rd, and, 6th, centuries, ad, the, bosporan, kingdom, was, also, overwhelmed, by, successive, waves, of, nomadic, invasions, led, by, warlike, tribes, which, would, often, move, on, to, europe, as, was, the, case, with, the, huns, and, turkish, avars, in, the, second, millennium, bc, the, territories, between, the, kama, and, the, irtysh, rivers, were, the, home, of, a, proto, uralic, speaking, population, that, had, contacts, with, proto, indo, european, speakers, from, the, south, the, woodland, population, is, the, ancestor, of, the, modern, ugrian, inhabitants, of, trans, uralia, other, researchers, say, that, the, khanty, people, originated, in, the, south, ural, steppe, and, moved, northwards, into, their, current, location, about, 500, ad, a, turkic, people, the, khazars, ruled, the, lower, volga, basin, steppes, between, the, caspian, and, black, seas, through, to, the, 8th, century, noted, for, their, laws, tolerance, and, cosmopolitanism, the, khazars, were, the, main, commercial, link, between, the, baltic, and, the, muslim, abbasid, empire, centered, in, baghdad, they, were, important, allies, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, and, waged, a, series, of, successful, wars, against, the, arab, caliphates, in, the, 8th, century, the, khazars, embraced, judaism, some, of, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, russians, were, the, slavic, tribes, whose, original, home, is, thought, by, some, scholars, to, have, been, the, pripet, marshes, the, early, east, slavs, gradually, settled, western, russia, in, two, waves, one, moving, from, kiev, present, day, ukraine, towards, present, day, suzdal, and, murom, and, another, from, polotsk, present, day, belarus, towards, novgorod, and, rostov, from, the, 7th, century, onwards, east, slavs, constituted, the, bulk, of, the, population, in, western, russia, and, slowly, conquered, and, assimilated, the, native, finnic, and, baltic, tribes, such, as, the, merya, the, muromians, and, the, meshchera, scandinavian, norsemen, known, as, vikings, in, western, europe, and, varangians, in, the, east, combined, piracy, and, trade, throughout, northern, europe, in, the, mid, 9th, century, they, began, to, venture, along, the, waterways, from, the, eastern, baltic, to, the, black, and, caspian, seas, according, to, the, legendary, calling, of, the, varangians, recorded, in, several, rus, chronicles, such, as, the, novgorod, first, chronicle, and, primary, chronicle, the, varangians, rurik, sineus, and, truvor, were, invited, in, the, 860s, to, restore, order, in, three, towns, either, novgorod, most, texts, or, staraya, ladoga, hypatian, codex, beloozero, and, izborsk, most, texts, or, slovensk, pskov, third, chronicle, respectively, their, successors, allegedly, moved, south, and, extended, their, authority, to, kiev, which, had, been, previously, dominated, by, the, khazars, thus, the, first, east, slavic, state, rus, emerged, in, the, 9th, century, along, the, dnieper, river, valley, a, coordinated, group, of, princely, states, with, a, common, interest, in, maintaining, trade, along, the, river, routes, kievan, rus, controlled, the, trade, route, for, furs, wax, and, slaves, between, scandinavia, and, the, byzantine, empire, along, the, volkhov, and, dnieper, rivers, by, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, the, minority, norse, military, aristocracy, had, merged, with, the, native, slavic, population, which, also, absorbed, greek, christian, influences, in, the, course, of, the, multiple, campaigns, to, loot, tsargrad, or, constantinople, one, such, campaign, claimed, the, life, of, the, foremost, slavic, druzhina, leader, svyatoslav, i, who, was, renowned, for, having, crushed, the, power, of, the, khazars, on, the, volga, kievan, rus, is, important, for, its, introduction, of, a, slavic, variant, of, the, eastern, orthodox, religion, dramatically, deepening, a, synthesis, of, byzantine, and, slavic, cultures, that, defined, russian, culture, for, the, next, thousand, years, the, region, adopted, christianity, in, 988, by, the, official, act, of, public, baptism, of, kiev, inhabitants, by, prince, vladimir, i, some, years, later, the, first, code, of, laws, russkaya, pravda, was, introduced, by, yaroslav, the, wise, from, the, onset, the, kievan, princes, followed, the, byzantine, example, and, kept, the, church, dependent, on, them, by, the, 11th, century, particularly, during, the, reign, of, yaroslav, the, wise, kievan, rus, displayed, an, economy, and, achievements, in, architecture, and, literature, superior, to, those, that, then, existed, in, the, western, part, of, the, continent, compared, with, the, languages, of, european, christendom, the, russian, language, was, little, influenced, by, the, greek, and, latin, of, early, christian, writings, this, was, because, church, slavonic, was, used, directly, in, liturgy, instead, a, nomadic, turkic, people, the, kipchaks, also, known, as, the, cumans, replaced, the, earlier, pechenegs, as, the, dominant, force, in, the, south, steppe, regions, neighbouring, to, rus, at, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, and, founded, a, nomadic, state, in, the, steppes, along, the, black, sea, desht, e, kipchak, repelling, their, regular, attacks, especially, in, kiev, was, a, heavy, burden, for, the, southern, areas, of, rus, the, nomadic, incursions, caused, a, massive, influx, of, slavs, to, the, safer, heavily, forested, regions, of, the, north, particularly, to, the, area, known, as, zalesye, kievan, rus, ultimately, disintegrated, as, a, state, because, of, in, fighting, between, members, of, the, princely, family, that, ruled, it, collectively, kiev, s, dominance, waned, to, the, benefit, of, vladimir, suzdal, in, the, north, east, novgorod, in, the, north, and, halych, volhynia, in, the, south, west, conquest, by, the, mongol, golden, horde, in, the, 13th, century, was, the, final, blow, kiev, was, destroyed, halych, volhynia, would, eventually, be, absorbed, into, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, while, the, mongol, dominated, vladimir, suzdal, and, independent, novgorod, republic, two, regions, on, the, periphery, of, kiev, would, establish, the, basis, for, the, modern, russian, nation, the, invading, mongols, accelerated, the, fragmentation, of, the, rus, in, 1223, the, disunited, southern, princes, faced, a, mongol, raiding, party, at, the, kalka, river, and, were, soundly, defeated, in, 1237, 1238, the, mongols, burnt, down, the, city, of, vladimir, 4, february, 1238, and, other, major, cities, of, northeast, russia, routed, the, russians, at, the, sit, river, and, then, moved, west, into, poland, and, hungary, by, then, they, had, conquered, most, of, the, russian, principalities, only, the, novgorod, republic, escaped, occupation, and, continued, to, flourish, in, the, orbit, of, the, hanseatic, league, the, impact, of, the, mongol, invasion, on, the, territories, of, kievan, rus, was, uneven, the, advanced, city, culture, was, almost, completely, destroyed, as, older, centers, such, as, kiev, and, vladimir, never, recovered, from, the, devastation, of, the, initial, attack, the, new, cities, of, moscow, tver, and, nizhny, novgorod, began, to, compete, for, hegemony, in, the, mongol, dominated, rus, principalities, under, the, suzerainty, of, the, golden, horde, although, a, coalition, of, rus, princes, led, by, dmitry, donskoy, defeated, mongol, warlord, mamai, at, kulikovo, in, 1380, forces, of, the, new, khan, tokhtamysh, and, his, rus, allies, immediately, sacked, moscow, in, 1382, as, punishment, for, resisting, mongol, authority, mongol, domination, of, the, rus, principalities, along, with, tax, collection, by, various, overlords, such, as, the, crimean, khans, continued, into, the, early, 16th, century, despite, later, claims, of, muscovite, bookmen, that, the, indecisive, standoff, at, the, ugra, in, 1480, had, signified, the, end, of, the, tatar, yoke, and, the, liberation, of, russia, the, mongols, dominated, the, lower, reaches, of, the, volga, and, held, russia, in, sway, from, their, western, capital, at, sarai, one, of, the, largest, cities, of, the, medieval, world, the, princes, had, to, pay, tribute, to, the, mongols, of, the, golden, horde, commonly, called, tatars, but, in, return, they, received, charters, authorizing, them, to, act, as, deputies, to, the, khans, in, general, the, princes, were, allowed, considerable, freedom, to, rule, as, they, wished, while, the, russian, orthodox, church, even, experienced, a, spiritual, revival, the, mongols, left, their, impact, on, the, russians, in, such, areas, as, military, tactics, and, transportation, under, mongol, occupation, muscovy, also, developed, its, postal, road, network, census, fiscal, system, and, military, organization, at, the, same, time, prince, of, novgorod, alexander, nevsky, managed, to, repel, the, offensive, of, the, northern, crusades, against, novgorod, from, the, west, despite, this, becoming, the, grand, prince, alexander, declared, himself, a, vassal, to, the, golden, horde, not, having, the, strength, to, resist, its, power, daniil, aleksandrovich, the, youngest, son, of, alexander, nevsky, founded, the, principality, of, moscow, known, as, muscovy, in, english, which, first, cooperated, with, and, ultimately, expelled, the, tatars, from, russia, well, situated, in, the, central, river, system, of, russia, and, surrounded, by, protective, forests, and, marshes, moscow, was, at, first, only, a, vassal, of, vladimir, but, soon, it, absorbed, its, parent, state, a, major, factor, in, the, ascendancy, of, moscow, was, the, cooperation, of, its, rulers, with, the, mongol, overlords, who, granted, them, the, title, of, grand, prince, of, moscow, and, made, them, agents, for, collecting, the, tatar, tribute, from, the, russian, principalities, the, principality, s, prestige, was, further, enhanced, when, it, became, the, center, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, its, head, the, metropolitan, fled, from, kiev, to, vladimir, in, 1299, and, a, few, years, later, established, the, permanent, headquarters, of, the, church, in, moscow, under, the, original, title, of, kiev, metropolitan, by, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, the, power, of, the, mongols, was, declining, and, the, grand, princes, felt, able, to, openly, oppose, the, mongol, yoke, in, 1380, at, battle, of, kulikovo, on, the, don, river, the, mongols, were, defeated, and, although, this, hard, fought, victory, did, not, end, tatar, rule, of, russia, it, did, bring, great, fame, to, the, grand, prince, dmitry, donskoy, moscow, s, leadership, in, russia, was, now, firmly, based, and, by, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, its, territory, had, greatly, expanded, through, purchase, war, and, marriage, in, the, 15th, century, the, grand, princes, of, moscow, continued, to, consolidate, russian, land, to, increase, their, population, and, wealth, the, most, successful, practitioner, of, this, process, was, ivan, iii, who, laid, the, foundations, for, a, russian, national, state, ivan, competed, with, his, powerful, northwestern, rival, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, for, control, over, some, of, the, semi, independent, upper, principalities, in, the, upper, dnieper, and, oka, river, basins, through, the, defections, of, some, princes, border, skirmishes, and, a, long, war, with, the, novgorod, republic, ivan, iii, was, able, to, annex, novgorod, and, tver, as, a, result, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, tripled, in, size, under, his, rule, during, his, conflict, with, pskov, a, monk, named, filofei, philotheus, of, pskov, composed, a, letter, to, ivan, iii, with, the, prophecy, that, the, latter, s, kingdom, would, be, the, third, rome, the, fall, of, constantinople, and, the, death, of, the, last, greek, orthodox, christian, emperor, contributed, to, this, new, idea, of, moscow, as, new, rome, and, the, seat, of, orthodox, christianity, as, did, ivan, s, 1472, marriage, to, byzantine, princess, sophia, palaiologina, under, ivan, iii, the, first, central, government, bodies, were, created, in, russia, prikaz, the, sudebnik, was, adopted, the, first, set, of, laws, since, the, 11th, century, the, double, headed, eagle, was, adopted, as, the, coat, of, arms, of, russia, ivan, proclaimed, his, absolute, sovereignty, over, all, russian, princes, and, nobles, refusing, further, tribute, to, the, tatars, ivan, initiated, a, series, of, attacks, that, opened, the, way, for, the, complete, defeat, of, the, declining, golden, horde, now, divided, into, several, khanates, and, hordes, ivan, and, his, successors, sought, to, protect, the, southern, boundaries, of, their, domain, against, attacks, of, the, crimean, tatars, and, other, hordes, to, achieve, this, aim, they, sponsored, the, construction, of, the, great, abatis, belt, and, granted, manors, to, nobles, who, were, obliged, to, serve, in, the, military, the, manor, system, provided, a, basis, for, an, emerging, cavalry, based, army, in, this, way, internal, consolidation, accompanied, outward, expansion, of, the, state, by, the, 16th, century, the, rulers, of, moscow, considered, the, entire, russian, territory, their, collective, property, various, semi, independent, princes, still, claimed, specific, territories, but, ivan, iii, forced, the, lesser, princes, to, acknowledge, the, grand, prince, of, moscow, and, his, descendants, as, unquestioned, rulers, with, control, over, military, judicial, and, foreign, affairs, gradually, the, russian, ruler, emerged, as, a, powerful, autocratic, ruler, a, tsar, the, first, russian, ruler, to, officially, crown, himself, tsar, was, ivan, iv, ivan, iii, tripled, the, territory, of, his, state, ended, the, dominance, of, the, golden, horde, over, the, rus, renovated, the, moscow, kremlin, and, laid, the, foundations, of, the, russian, state, biographer, fennell, concludes, that, his, reign, was, militarily, glorious, and, economically, sound, and, especially, points, to, his, territorial, annexations, and, his, centralized, control, over, local, rulers, however, fennell, argues, that, his, reign, was, also, a, period, of, cultural, depression, and, spiritual, barrenness, freedom, was, stamped, out, within, the, russian, lands, by, his, bigoted, anti, catholicism, ivan, brought, down, the, curtain, between, russia, and, the, west, for, the, sake, of, territorial, aggrandizement, he, deprived, his, country, of, the, fruits, of, western, learning, and, civilization, the, development, of, the, tsar, s, autocratic, powers, reached, a, peak, during, the, reign, of, ivan, iv, 1547, 1584, known, as, ivan, the, terrible, he, strengthened, the,

one, mighty, campaign, after, 1815, london, feared, russia, alone, would, do, it, step, by, step, however, historians, report, that, the, russians, never, had, any, intention, to, move, against, india, in, the, 1860s, a, movement, known, as, nihilism, developed, in, russia, a, term, originally, coined, by, ivan, turgenev, in, his, 1862, novel, fathers, and, sons, nihilists, favoured, the, destruction, of, human, institutions, and, laws, based, on, the, assumption, that, they, are, artificial, and, corrupt, at, its, core, russian, nihilism, was, characterized, by, the, belief, that, the, world, lacks, comprehensible, meaning, objective, truth, or, value, for, some, time, many, russian, liberals, had, been, dissatisfied, by, what, they, regarded, as, the, empty, discussions, of, the, intelligentsia, the, nihilists, questioned, all, old, values, and, shocked, the, russian, establishment, they, became, involved, in, the, cause, of, reform, and, became, major, political, forces, their, path, was, facilitated, by, the, previous, actions, of, the, decembrists, who, revolted, in, 1825, and, the, financial, and, political, hardship, caused, by, the, crimean, war, which, caused, many, russians, to, lose, faith, in, political, institutions, russian, nihilists, created, the, manifesto, catechism, of, a, revolutionary, after, the, nihilists, failed, to, convert, the, aristocracy, and, landed, gentry, to, the, cause, of, reform, they, turned, to, the, peasants, their, campaign, became, known, as, the, narodnk, populist, movement, it, was, based, on, the, belief, that, the, common, people, had, the, wisdom, and, peaceful, ability, to, lead, the, nation, as, the, narodnik, movement, gained, momentum, the, government, moved, to, extirpate, it, in, response, to, the, growing, reaction, of, the, government, a, radical, branch, of, the, narodniks, advocated, and, practiced, terrorism, one, after, another, prominent, officials, were, shot, or, killed, by, bombs, this, represented, the, ascendancy, of, anarchism, in, russia, as, a, powerful, revolutionary, force, finally, after, several, attempts, alexander, ii, was, assassinated, by, anarchists, in, 1881, on, the, very, day, he, had, approved, a, proposal, to, call, a, representative, assembly, to, consider, new, reforms, in, addition, to, the, abolition, of, serfdom, designed, to, ameliorate,

its, beginning, as, early, as, 1850, and, its, end, as, late, as, 1960, unlike, his, father, the, new, tsar, alexander, iii, 1881, 1894, was, throughout, his, reign, a, staunch, reactionary, who, revived, the, maxim, of, orthodoxy, autocracy, and, national, character, a, committed, slavophile, alexander, iii, believed, that, russia, could, be, saved, from, chaos, only, by, shutting, itself,

advocated, complete, social, economic, and, political, revolution, in, 1903, the, rsdlp, split, into, two, wings, the, radical, bolsheviks, led, by, vladimir, lenin, and, the, relatively, moderate, mensheviks, led, by, yuli, martov, the, mensheviks, believed, that, russian, socialism, would, grow, gradually, and, peacefully, and, that, the, tsar, s, regime, should, be, succeeded, by, a,

armed, forces, in, the, russo, japanese, war, was, a, major, blow, to, the, russian, state, and, increased, the, potential, for, unrest, in, january, 1905, an, incident, known, as, bloody, sunday, occurred, when, father, gapon, led, an, enormous, crowd, to, the, winter, palace, in, saint, petersburg, to, present, a, petition, to, the, tsar, when, the, procession, reached, the, palace, cossacks,

wanted, to, avoid, war, but, in, that, crisis, they, had, the, support, of, france, and, believed, that, supporting, serbia, was, important, for, russia, s, credibility, and, for, its, goal, of, a,

from, the, western, front, to, the, russian, front, however, victories, in, poland, by, the, central, powers, in, the, 1915, campaign, led, to, a, major, retreat, of, the, russian, army, in, 1916, the, russians, again, dealt, a, powerful, blow, to, the, austrians, during, the, brusilov, offensive, by, 1915, morale, was, worsening, many, recruits, were, sent, to, the, front, unarmed, nevertheless, the, russian, army, fought, on, and, tied, down, large, numbers, of, germans, and, austrians, when, the, homefront, showed, an, occasional, surge, of, patriotism, the, tsar, and, his,

authority, the, duma, declared, a, provisional, government, headed, by, prince, lvov, which, was, collectively, known, as, the, russian, republic, meanwhile, the, socialists, in, petrograd, organized, elections, among, workers, and, soldiers, to, form, a, soviet, council, of, workers, and, soldiers, deputies, as, an, organ, of, popular, power, that, could, pressure, the, bourgeois, provisional, government, in, july, following, a, series, of, crises, that, undermined, their, authority, with, the, public, the, head, of, the, provisional, government, resigned, and, was, succeeded, by,

control, of, the, government, in, november, 1917, and, drove, kerensky, and, his, moderate, provisional, government, into, exile, in, the, events, that, would, become, known, as, the, october, revolution, bolshevik, figures, such, as, anatoly, lunacharsky, moisei, uritsky, and, dmitry, manuilsky, agreed, that, lenin, s, influence, on, the, bolshevik, party, was, decisive, but, the, october, insurrection, was, carried, out, according, to, trotsky, s, not, to, lenin, s, plan, when, the, national, constituent, assembly, elected, in, december, 1917, refused, to, become, a, rubber, stamp, of, the, bolsheviks, it, was, dissolved, by, lenin, s, troops, and, all, vestiges, of, democracy, were, removed, with, the, handicap, of, the, moderate, opposition, removed, lenin, was, able, to, free, his, regime, from, the, war, problem, by, the, harsh, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, 1918, with, germany, russia, lost, much, of, her, western, borderlands, however, when, germany, was, defeated, the, soviet, government, repudiated, the, treaty, the, bolshevik, grip, on, power, was, by, no, means, secure, and, a, lengthy, struggle, broke, out, between, the, new, regime, and, its, opponents, which, included, the, socialist, revolutionaries, the, anti, bolshevik, white, movement, and, large, numbers, of, peasants, at, the, same, time, the, allied, powers, sent, several, expeditionary, armies, to, support, the, anti, communist, forces, in, an, attempt, to, force, russia, to, rejoin, the, world, war, the, bolsheviks, fought, against, both, these, forces, and, national, independence, movements, in, the, former, russian, empire, by, 1921, they, had, defeated, their, internal, enemies, and, brought, most, of, the, newly, independent, states, under, their, control, with, the, exception, of,

asserts, that, the, total, number, of, victims, could, be, 1, 3, million, whereas, others, give, estimates, ranging, from, 10, 000, in, the, initial, period, of, repression, to, 140, 000, and, an,

in, the, revolutions, of, 1989, the, ussr, lost, its, allies, in, eastern, europe, gorbachev, s, attempts, at, economic, reform, were, not, sufficient, and, the, soviet, government, left, intact,

1987, yeltsin, who, represented, himself, as, a, committed, democrat, presented, a, significant, opposition, to, gorbachev, s, authority, in, a, remarkable, reversal, of, fortunes, he, gained,

collapsed, in, three, days, but, disintegration, of, the, union, became, imminent, the, russian, government, took, over, most, of, the, soviet, union, government, institutions, on, its, territory,
