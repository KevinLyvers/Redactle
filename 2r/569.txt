the, gulag, was, a, system, of, forced, labor, camps, in, the, soviet, union, the, word, gulag, originally, referred, only, to, the, division, of, the, soviet, secret, police, that, was, in, charge, of, running, the, forced, labor, camps, from, the, 1930s, to, the, early, 1950s, during, joseph, stalin, s, rule, but, in, english, literature, the, term, is, popularly, used, for, the, system, of, forced, labor, throughout, the, soviet, era, the, abbreviation, gulag, stands, for, main, directorate, of, correctional, labour, camps, but, the, full, official, name, of, the, agency, changed, several, times, the, gulag, is, recognized, as, a, major, instrument, of, political, repression, in, the, soviet, union, the, camps, housed, both, ordinary, criminals, and, political, prisoners, a, large, number, of, whom, were, convicted, by, simplified, procedures, such, as, nkvd, troikas, or, other, instruments, of, extrajudicial, punishment, in, 1918, 1922, the, agency, was, administered, by, the, cheka, followed, by, the, gpu, 1922, 1923, the, ogpu, 1923, 1934, later, known, as, the, nkvd, 1934, 1946, and, the, ministry, of, internal, affairs, mvd, in, the, final, years, the, solovki, prison, camp, the, first, correctional, labour, camp, which, was, constructed, after, the, revolution, was, opened, in, 1918, and, legalized, by, a, decree, on, the, creation, of, the, forced, labor, camps, on, april, 15, 1919, the, internment, system, grew, rapidly, reaching, a, population, of, 100, 000, in, the, 1920s, by, the, end, of, 1940, the, population, of, the, gulag, camps, amounted, to, 1, 5, million, the, emergent, consensus, among, scholars, is, that, of, the, 14, million, prisoners, who, passed, through, the, gulag, camps, and, the, 4, million, prisoners, who, passed, through, the, gulag, colonies, from, 1930, to, 1953, roughly, 1, 5, to, 1, 7, million, prisoners, perished, there, or, died, soon, after, they, were, released, some, journalists, and, writers, who, question, the, reliability, of, such, data, heavily, rely, on, memoir, sources, that, come, to, higher, estimations, archival, researchers, have, found, no, plan, of, destruction, of, the, gulag, population, and, no, statement, of, official, intent, to, kill, them, and, prisoner, releases, vastly, exceeded, the, number, of, deaths, in, the, gulag, this, policy, can, partially, be, attributed, to, the, common, practice, of, releasing, prisoners, who, were, suffering, from, incurable, diseases, as, well, as, prisoners, who, were, near, death, almost, immediately, after, the, death, of, stalin, the, soviet, establishment, started, to, dismantle, the, gulag, system, a, mass, general, amnesty, was, granted, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, stalin, s, death, but, it, was, only, offered, to, non, political, prisoners, and, political, prisoners, who, had, been, sentenced, to, a, maximum, of, five, years, in, prison, shortly, thereafter, nikita, khrushchev, was, elected, first, secretary, initiating, the, processes, of, de, stalinization, and, the, khrushchev, thaw, triggering, a, mass, release, and, rehabilitation, of, political, prisoners, six, years, later, on, 25, january, 1960, the, gulag, system, was, officially, abolished, when, the, remains, of, its, administration, were, dissolved, by, khrushchev, the, legal, practice, of, sentencing, convicts, to, penal, labor, continues, to, exist, in, the, russian, federation, but, its, capacity, is, greatly, reduced, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, winner, of, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, who, survived, eight, years, of, gulag, incarceration, gave, the, term, its, international, repute, with, the, publication, of, the, gulag, archipelago, in, 1973, the, author, likened, the, scattered, camps, to, a, chain, of, islands, and, as, an, eyewitness, he, described, the, gulag, as, a, system, where, people, were, worked, to, death, in, march, 1940, there, were, 53, gulag, camp, directorates, simply, referred, to, as, camps, and, 423, labor, colonies, in, the, soviet, union, many, mining, and, industrial, towns, and, cities, in, northern, russia, eastern, russia, and, kazakhstan, such, as, karaganda, norilsk, vorkuta, and, magadan, were, blocks, of, camps, which, were, originally, built, by, prisoners, and, subsequently, run, by, ex, prisoners, gulag, stands, for, main, directorate, of, correctional, labour, camps, it, was, renamed, several, times, e, g, to, main, directorate, of, correctional, labor, colonies, which, names, can, be, seen, in, the, documents, describing, the, subordination, of, various, camps, some, historians, estimate, that, 14, million, people, were, imprisoned, in, the, gulag, labor, camps, from, 1929, to, 1953, the, estimates, for, the, period, from, 1918, to, 1929, are, more, difficult, to, calculate, other, calculations, by, historian, orlando, figes, refer, to, 25, million, prisoners, of, the, gulag, in, 1928, 1953, a, further, 6, 7, million, were, deported, and, exiled, to, remote, areas, of, the, ussr, and, 4, 5, million, passed, through, labor, colonies, plus, 3, 5, million, who, were, already, in, or, had, been, sent, to, labor, settlements, according, to, some, estimates, the, total, population, of, the, camps, varied, from, 510, 307, in, 1934, to, 1, 727, 970, in, 1953, according, to, other, estimates, at, the, beginning, of, 1953, the, total, number, of, prisoners, in, prison, camps, was, more, than, 2, 4, million, of, which, more, than, 465, 000, were, political, prisoners, between, the, years, 1934, to, 1953, 20, to, 40, of, the, gulag, population, in, each, given, year, were, released, the, institutional, analysis, of, the, soviet, concentration, system, is, complicated, by, the, formal, distinction, between, gulag, and, gupvi, gupvi, was, the, main, administration, for, affairs, of, prisoners, of, war, and, internees, glavnoye, upravleniye, po, delam, voyennoplennyh, i, internirovannyh, a, department, of, nkvd, later, mvd, in, charge, of, handling, of, foreign, civilian, internees, and, pows, prisoners, of, war, in, the, soviet, union, during, and, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, 1939, 1953, in, many, ways, the, gupvi, system, was, similar, to, gulag, its, major, function, was, the, organization, of, foreign, forced, labor, in, the, soviet, union, the, top, management, of, gupvi, came, from, the, gulag, system, the, major, memoir, noted, distinction, from, gulag, was, the, absence, of, convicted, criminals, in, the, gupvi, camps, otherwise, the, conditions, in, both, camp, systems, were, similar, hard, labor, poor, nutrition, and, living, conditions, and, high, mortality, rate, for, the, soviet, political, prisoners, like, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, all, foreign, civilian, detainees, and, foreign, pows, were, imprisoned, in, the, gulag, the, surviving, foreign, civilians, and, pows, considered, themselves, prisoners, in, the, gulag, according, to, the, estimates, in, total, during, the, whole, period, of, the, existence, of, the, gupvi, there, were, over, 500, pow, camps, within, the, soviet, union, and, abroad, which, imprisoned, over, 4, 000, 000, pow, most, gulag, inmates, were, not, political, prisoners, although, significant, numbers, of, political, prisoners, could, be, found, in, the, camps, at, any, one, time, petty, crimes, and, jokes, about, the, soviet, government, and, officials, were, punishable, by, imprisonment, about, half, of, political, prisoners, in, the, gulag, camps, were, imprisoned, by, administrative, means, i, e, without, trial, at, courts, official, data, suggest, that, there, were, over, 2, 6, million, sentences, to, imprisonment, on, cases, investigated, by, the, secret, police, throughout, 1921, 53, maximum, sentences, varied, depending, on, the, type, of, crime, and, changed, over, time, from, 1953, the, maximum, sentence, for, petty, theft, was, six, months, having, previously, been, one, year, and, seven, years, theft, of, state, property, however, had, a, minimum, sentence, of, seven, years, and, a, maximum, of, twenty, five, in, 1958, the, maximum, sentence, for, any, crime, was, reduced, from, twenty, five, to, fifteen, years, in, 1960, the, ministerstvo, vnutrennikh, del, mvd, ceased, to, function, as, the, soviet, wide, administration, of, the, camps, in, favour, of, individual, republic, mvd, branches, the, centralised, detention, administrations, temporarily, ceased, functioning, although, the, term, gulag, was, originally, used, in, reference, to, a, government, agency, in, english, and, many, other, languages, the, acronym, acquired, the, qualities, of, a, common, noun, denoting, the, soviet, system, of, prison, based, unfree, labor, even, more, broadly, gulag, has, come, to, mean, the, soviet, repressive, system, itself, the, set, of, procedures, that, prisoners, once, called, the, meat, grinder, the, arrests, the, interrogations, the, transport, in, unheated, cattle, cars, the, forced, labor, the, destruction, of, families, the, years, spent, in, exile, the, early, and, unnecessary, deaths, western, authors, use, the, term, gulag, to, denote, all, the, prisons, and, internment, camps, in, the, soviet, union, the, term, s, contemporary, usage, is, at, times, notably, not, directly, related, to, the, ussr, such, as, in, the, expression, north, korea, s, gulag, for, camps, operational, today, the, word, gulag, was, not, often, used, in, russian, either, officially, or, colloquially, the, predominant, terms, were, the, camps, lagerya, and, the, zone, zona, usually, singular, for, the, labor, camp, system, and, for, the, individual, camps, the, official, term, correctional, labour, camp, was, suggested, for, official, use, by, the, politburo, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, in, the, session, of, july, 27, 1929, the, tsar, and, the, russian, empire, both, used, forced, exile, and, forced, labour, as, forms, of, judicial, punishment, katorga, a, category, of, punishment, which, was, reserved, for, those, who, were, convicted, of, the, most, serious, crimes, had, many, of, the, features, which, were, associated, with, labor, camp, imprisonment, confinement, simplified, facilities, as, opposed, to, the, facilities, which, existed, in, prisons, and, forced, labor, usually, involving, hard, unskilled, or, semi, skilled, work, according, to, historian, anne, applebaum, katorga, was, not, a, common, sentence, approximately, 6, 000, katorga, convicts, were, serving, sentences, in, 1906, and, 28, 600, in, 1916, under, the, imperial, russian, penal, system, those, who, were, convicted, of, less, serious, crimes, were, sent, to, corrective, prisons, and, they, were, also, made, to, work, forced, exile, to, siberia, had, been, in, use, for, a, wide, range, of, offenses, since, the, seventeenth, century, and, it, was, a, common, punishment, for, political, dissidents, and, revolutionaries, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, members, of, the, failed, decembrist, revolt, and, polish, nobles, who, resisted, russian, rule, were, sent, into, exile, fyodor, dostoevsky, was, sentenced, to, die, for, reading, banned, literature, in, 1849, but, the, sentence, was, commuted, to, banishment, to, siberia, members, of, various, socialist, revolutionary, groups, including, bolsheviks, such, as, sergo, ordzhonikidze, vladimir, lenin, leon, trotsky, and, joseph, stalin, were, also, sent, into, exile, convicts, who, were, serving, labor, sentences, and, exiles, were, sent, to, the, underpopulated, areas, of, siberia, and, the, russian, far, east, regions, that, lacked, towns, or, food, sources, as, well, as, organized, transportation, systems, despite, the, isolated, conditions, some, prisoners, successfully, escaped, to, populated, areas, stalin, himself, escaped, three, of, the, four, times, after, he, was, sent, into, exile, since, these, times, siberia, gained, its, fearful, connotation, as, a, place, of, punishment, a, reputation, which, was, further, enhanced, by, the, soviet, gulag, system, the, bolsheviks, own, experiences, with, exile, and, forced, labor, provided, them, with, a, model, which, they, could, base, their, own, system, on, including, the, importance, of, strict, enforcement, from, 1920, to, 1950, the, leaders, of, the, communist, party, and, the, soviet, state, considered, repression, a, tool, that, they, should, use, to, secure, the, normal, functioning, of, the, soviet, state, system, and, preserve, and, strengthen, their, positions, within, their, social, base, the, working, class, when, the, bolsheviks, took, power, peasants, represented, 80, of, the, population, in, the, midst, of, the, russian, civil, war, lenin, and, the, bolsheviks, established, a, special, prison, camp, system, separate, from, its, traditional, prison, system, and, under, the, control, of, the, cheka, these, camps, as, lenin, envisioned, them, had, a, distinctly, political, purpose, these, early, camps, of, the, gulag, system, were, introduced, in, order, to, isolate, and, eliminate, class, alien, socially, dangerous, disruptive, suspicious, and, other, disloyal, elements, whose, deeds, and, thoughts, were, not, contributing, to, the, strengthening, of, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, forced, labor, as, a, method, of, reeducation, was, applied, in, the, solovki, prison, camp, as, early, as, the, 1920s, based, on, trotsky, s, experiments, with, forced, labor, camps, for, czech, war, prisoners, from, 1918, and, his, proposals, to, introduce, compulsory, labor, service, voiced, in, terrorism, and, communism, these, concentration, camps, were, not, identical, to, the, stalinist, or, hitler, camps, but, were, introduced, to, isolate, war, prisoners, given, the, extreme, historical, situation, following, world, war, 1, various, categories, of, prisoners, were, defined, petty, criminals, pows, of, the, russian, civil, war, officials, accused, of, corruption, sabotage, and, embezzlement, political, enemies, dissidents, and, other, people, deemed, dangerous, for, the, state, in, the, first, decade, of, soviet, rule, the, judicial, and, penal, systems, were, neither, unified, nor, coordinated, and, there, was, a, distinction, between, criminal, prisoners, and, political, or, special, prisoners, the, traditional, judicial, and, prison, system, which, dealt, with, criminal, prisoners, were, first, overseen, by, the, people, s, commissariat, of, justice, until, 1922, after, which, they, were, overseen, by, the, people, s, commissariat, of, internal, affairs, also, known, as, the, nkvd, the, cheka, and, its, successor, organizations, the, gpu, or, state, political, directorate, and, the, ogpu, oversaw, political, prisoners, and, the, special, camps, to, which, they, were, sent, in, april, 1929, the, judicial, distinctions, between, criminal, and, political, prisoners, were, eliminated, and, control, of, the, entire, soviet, penal, system, turned, over, to, the, ogpu, in, 1928, there, were, 30, 000, individuals, interned, the, authorities, were, opposed, to, compelled, labor, in, 1927, the, official, in, charge, of, prison, administration, wrote, the, exploitation, of, prison, labour, the, system, of, squeezing, golden, sweat, from, them, the, organisation, of, production, in, places, of, confinement, which, while, profitable, from, a, commercial, point, of, view, is, fundamentally, lacking, in, corrective, significance, these, are, entirely, inadmissible, in, soviet, places, of, confinement, the, legal, base, and, the, guidance, for, the, creation, of, the, system, of, corrective, labor, camps, ispravitel, no, trudovye, lagerya, the, backbone, of, what, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, gulag, was, a, secret, decree, from, the, sovnarkom, of, july, 11, 1929, about, the, use, of, penal, labor, that, duplicated, the, corresponding, appendix, to, the, minutes, of, the, politburo, meeting, of, june, 27, 1929, one, of, the, gulag, system, founders, was, naftaly, frenkel, in, 1923, he, was, arrested, for, illegally, crossing, borders, and, smuggling, he, was, sentenced, to, 10, years, hard, labor, at, solovki, which, later, came, to, be, known, as, the, first, camp, of, the, gulag, while, serving, his, sentence, he, wrote, a, letter, to, the, camp, administration, detailing, a, number, of, productivity, improvement, proposals, including, the, infamous, system, of, labor, exploitation, whereby, the, inmates, food, rations, were, to, be, linked, to, their, rate, of, production, a, proposal, known, as, nourishment, scale, this, notorious, you, eat, as, you, work, system, would, often, kill, weaker, prisoners, in, weeks, and, caused, countless, casualties, the, letter, caught, the, attention, of, a, number, of, high, communist, officials, including, genrikh, yagoda, and, frenkel, soon, went, from, being, an, inmate, to, becoming, a, camp, commander, and, an, important, gulag, official, his, proposals, soon, saw, widespread, adoption, in, the, gulag, system, after, having, appeared, as, an, instrument, and, place, for, isolating, counter, revolutionary, and, criminal, elements, the, gulag, because, of, its, principle, of, correction, by, forced, labor, quickly, became, in, fact, an, independent, branch, of, the, national, economy, secured, on, the, cheap, labor, force, presented, by, prisoners, hence, it, is, followed, by, one, more, important, reason, for, the, constancy, of, the, repressive, policy, namely, the, state, s, interest, in, unremitting, rates, of, receiving, a, cheap, labor, force, that, was, forcibly, used, mainly, in, the, extreme, conditions, of, the, east, and, north, the, gulag, possessed, both, punitive, and, economic, functions, the, gulag, was, an, administration, body, that, watched, over, the, camps, eventually, its, name, would, be, used, for, these, camps, retrospectively, after, lenin, s, death, in, 1924, stalin, was, able, to, take, control, of, the, government, and, began, to, form, the, gulag, system, on, june, 27, 1929, the, politburo, created, a, system, of, self, supporting, camps, that, would, eventually, replace, the, existing, prisons, around, the, country, these, prisons, were, meant, to, receive, inmates, that, received, a, prison, sentence, that, exceeded, three, years, prisoners, who, had, a, shorter, prison, sentence, than, three, years, were, to, remain, in, the, prison, system, that, was, still, under, the, purview, of, the, nkvd, the, purpose, of, these, new, camps, was, to, colonise, the, remote, and, inhospitable, environments, throughout, the, soviet, union, these, changes, took, place, around, the, same, time, that, stalin, started, to, institute, collectivisation, and, rapid, industrial, development, collectivisation, resulted, in, a, large, scale, purge, of, peasants, and, so, called, kulaks, the, kulaks, were, supposedly, wealthy, comparatively, to, other, soviet, peasants, and, were, considered, to, be, capitalists, by, the, state, and, by, extension, enemies, of, socialism, the, term, would, also, become, associated, with, anyone, who, opposed, or, even, seemed, unsatisfied, with, the, soviet, government, by, late, 1929, stalin, began, a, program, known, as, dekulakization, stalin, demanded, that, the, kulak, class, be, completely, wiped, out, resulting, in, the, imprisonment, and, execution, of, soviet, peasants, in, a, mere, four, months, 60, 000, people, were, sent, to, the, camps, and, another, 154, 000, exiled, this, was, only, the, beginning, of, the, dekulakisation, process, however, in, 1931, alone, 1, 803, 392, people, were, exiled, although, these, massive, relocation, processes, were, successful, in, getting, a, large, potential, free, forced, labor, work, force, where, they, needed, to, be, that, is, about, all, it, was, successful, at, doing, the, special, settlers, as, the, soviet, government, referred, to, them, all, lived, on, starvation, level, rations, and, many, people, starved, to, death, in, the, camps, and, anyone, who, was, healthy, enough, to, escape, tried, to, do, just, that, this, resulted, in, the, government, having, to, give, rations, to, a, group, of, people, they, were, getting, hardly, any, use, out, of, and, was, just, costing, the, soviet, government, money, the, unified, state, political, administration, ogpu, quickly, realised, the, problem, and, began, to, reform, the, dekulakisation, process, to, help, prevent, the, mass, escapes, the, ogpu, started, to, recruit, people, within, the, colony, to, help, stop, people, who, attempted, to, leave, and, set, up, ambushes, around, known, popular, escape, routes, the, ogpu, also, attempted, to, raise, the, living, conditions, in, these, camps, that, would, not, encourage, people, to, actively, try, and, escape, and, kulaks, were, promised, that, they, would, regain, their, rights, after, five, years, even, these, revisions, ultimately, failed, to, resolve, the, problem, and, the, dekulakisation, process, was, a, failure, in, providing, the, government, with, a, steady, forced, labor, force, these, prisoners, were, also, lucky, to, be, in, the, gulag, in, the, early, 1930s, prisoners, were, relatively, well, off, compared, to, what, the, prisoners, would, have, to, go, through, in, the, final, years, of, the, gulag, the, gulag, was, officially, established, on, april, 25, 1930, as, the, gulag, by, the, ogpu, order, 130, 63, in, accordance, with, the, sovnarkom, order, 22, p, 248, dated, april, 7, 1930, it, was, renamed, as, the, gulag, in, november, of, that, year, the, hypothesis, that, economic, considerations, were, responsible, for, mass, arrests, during, the, period, of, stalinism, has, been, refuted, on, the, grounds, of, former, soviet, archives, that, have, become, accessible, since, the, 1990s, although, some, archival, sources, also, tend, to, support, an, economic, hypothesis, in, any, case, the, development, of, the, camp, system, followed, economic, lines, the, growth, of, the, camp, system, coincided, with, the, peak, of, the, soviet, industrialisation, campaign, most, of, the, camps, established, to, accommodate, the, masses, of, incoming, prisoners, were, assigned, distinct, economic, tasks, these, included, the, exploitation, of, natural, resources, and, the, colonization, of, remote, areas, as, well, as, the, realisation, of, enormous, infrastructural, facilities, and, industrial, construction, projects, the, plan, to, achieve, these, goals, with, special, settlements, instead, of, labor, camps, was, dropped, after, the, revealing, of, the, nazino, affair, in, 1933, the, 1931, 32, archives, indicate, the, gulag, had, approximately, 200, 000, prisoners, in, the, camps, while, in, 1935, approximately, 800, 000, were, in, camps, and, 300, 000, in, colonies, gulag, population, reached, a, peak, value, 1, 5, million, in, 1941, gradually, decreased, during, the, war, and, then, started, to, grow, again, achieving, a, maximum, by, 1953, besides, gulag, camps, a, significant, amount, of, prisoners, which, confined, prisoners, serving, short, sentence, terms, in, the, early, 1930s, a, tightening, of, the, soviet, penal, policy, caused, a, significant, growth, of, the, prison, camp, population, during, the, great, purge, of, 1937, 38, mass, arrests, caused, another, increase, in, inmate, numbers, hundreds, of, thousands, of, persons, were, arrested, and, sentenced, to, long, prison, terms, on, the, grounds, of, one, of, the, multiple, passages, of, the, notorious, article, 58, of, the, criminal, codes, of, the, union, republics, which, defined, punishment, for, various, forms, of, counterrevolutionary, activities, under, nkvd, order, no, 00447, tens, of, thousands, of, gulag, inmates, were, executed, in, 1937, 38, for, continuing, counterrevolutionary, activities, between, 1934, and, 1941, the, number, of, prisoners, with, higher, education, increased, more, than, eight, times, and, the, number, of, prisoners, with, high, education, increased, five, times, it, resulted, in, their, increased, share, in, the, overall, composition, of, the, camp, prisoners, among, the, camp, prisoners, the, number, and, share, of, the, intelligentsia, was, growing, at, the, quickest, pace, distrust, hostility, and, even, hatred, for, the, intelligentsia, was, a, common, characteristic, of, the, soviet, leaders, information, regarding, the, imprisonment, trends, and, consequences, for, the, intelligentsia, derive, from, the, extrapolations, of, viktor, zemskov, from, a, collection, of, prison, camp, population, movements, data, on, the, eve, of, world, war, ii, soviet, archives, indicate, a, combined, camp, and, colony, population, upwards, of, 1, 6, million, in, 1939, according, to, v, p, kozlov, anne, applebaum, and, steven, rosefielde, estimate, that, 1, 2, to, 1, 5, million, people, were, in, gulag, system, s, prison, camps, and, colonies, when, the, war, started, after, the, german, invasion, of, poland, that, marked, the, start, of, world, war, ii, in,

republic, of, moldova, and, bukovina, according, to, some, estimates, hundreds, of, thousands, of, polish, citizens, and, inhabitants, of, the, other, annexed, lands, regardless, of, their, ethnic, origin, were, arrested, and, sent, to, the, gulag, camps, however, according, to, the, official, data, the, total, number, of, sentences, for, political, and, anti, state, espionage, terrorism, crimes, in, the, ussr, in, 1939, 41, was, 211, 106, approximately, 300, 000, polish, prisoners, of, war, were, captured, by, the, ussr, during, and, after, the, polish, defensive, war, almost, all, of, the, captured, officers, and, a, large, number, of, ordinary, soldiers, were, then, murdered, see, katyn, massacre, or, sent, to, gulag, of, the, 10, 000, 12, 000, poles, sent, to, kolyma, in, 1940, 41, most, prisoners, of, war, only, 583, men, survived, released, in, 1942, to, join, the, polish, armed, forces, in, the, east, out, of, general, anders, 80, 000, evacuees, from, soviet, union, gathered, in, great, britain, only, 310, volunteered, to, return, to, soviet, controlled, poland, in, 1947, during, the, great, patriotic, war, gulag, populations, declined, sharply, due, to, a, steep, rise, in, mortality, in, 1942, 43, in, the, winter, of, 1941, a, quarter, of, the, gulag, s, population, died, of, starvation, 516, 841, prisoners, died, in, prison, camps, in, 1941, 43, from, a, combination, of, their, harsh, working, conditions, and, the, famine, caused, by, the, german, invasion, this, period, accounts, for, about, half, of, all, gulag, deaths, according, to, russian, statistics, in, 1943, the, term, katorga, works, was, reintroduced, they, were, initially, intended, for, nazi, collaborators, but, then, other, categories, of, political, prisoners, for, example, members, of, deported, peoples, who, fled, from, exile, were, also, sentenced, to, katorga, works, prisoners, sentenced, to, katorga, works, were, sent, to, gulag, prison, camps, with, the, most, harsh, regime, and, many, of, them, perished, up, until, world, war, ii, the, gulag, system, expanded, dramatically, to, create, a, soviet, camp, economy, right, before, the, war, forced, labor, provided, 46, 5, of, the, nation, s, nickel, 76, of, its, tin, 40, of, its, cobalt, 40, 5, of, its, chrome, iron, ore, 60, of, its, gold, and, 25, 3, of, its, timber, and, in, preparation, for, war, the, nkvd, put, up, many, more, factories, and, built, highways, and, railroads, the, gulag, quickly, switched, to, the, production, of, arms, and, supplies, for, the, army, after, fighting, began, at, first, transportation, remained, a, priority, in, 1940, the, nkvd, focused, most, of, its, energy, on, railroad, construction, this, would, prove, extremely, important, when, the, german, advance, into, the, soviet, union, started, in, 1941, in, addition, factories, converted, to, produce, ammunition, uniforms, and, other, supplies, moreover, the, nkvd, gathered, skilled, workers, and, specialists, from, throughout, the, gulag, into, 380, special, colonies, which, produced, tanks, aircraft, armaments, and, ammunition, despite, its, low, capital, costs, the, camp, economy, suffered, from, serious, flaws, for, one, actual, productivity, almost, never, matched, estimates, the, estimates, proved, far, too, optimistic, in, addition, scarcity, of, machinery, and, tools, plagued, the, camps, and, the, tools, that, the, camps, did, have, quickly, broke, the, eastern, siberian, trust, of, the, chief, administration, of, camps, for, highway, construction, destroyed, ninety, four, trucks, in, just, three, years, but, the, greatest, problem, was, simple, forced, labor, was, less, efficient, than, free, labor, in, fact, prisoners, in, the, gulag, were, on, average, half, as, productive, as, free, laborers, in, the, ussr, at, the, time, which, may, be, partially, explained, by, malnutrition, to, make, up, for, this, disparity, the, nkvd, worked, prisoners, harder, than, ever, to, meet, rising, demand, prisoners, worked, longer, and, longer, hours, and, on, lower, food, rations, than, ever, before, a, camp, administrator, said, in, a, meeting, there, are, cases, when, a, prisoner, is, given, only, four, or, five, hours, out, of, twenty, four, for, rest, which, significantly, lowers, his, productivity, in, the, words, of, a, former, gulag, prisoner, by, the, spring, of, 1942, the, camp, ceased, to, function, it, was, difficult, to, find, people, who, were, even, able, to, gather, firewood, or, bury, the, dead, the, scarcity, of, food, stemmed, in, part, from, the, general, strain, on, the, entire, soviet, union, but, also, the, lack, of, central, aid, to, the, gulag, during, the, war, the, central, government, focused, all, its, attention, on, the, military, and, left, the, camps, to, their, own, devices, in, 1942, the, gulag, set, up, the, supply, administration, to, find, their, own, food, and, industrial, goods, during, this, time, not, only, did, food, become, scarce, but, the, nkvd, limited, rations, in, an, attempt, to, motivate, the, prisoners, to, work, harder, for, more, food, a, policy, that, lasted, until, 1948, in, addition, to, food, shortages, the, gulag, suffered, from, labor, scarcity, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, the, great, terror, of, 1936, 1938, had, provided, a, large, supply, of, free, labor, but, by, the, start, of, world, war, ii, the, purges, had, slowed, down, in, order, to, complete, all, of, their, projects, camp, administrators, moved, prisoners, from, project, to, project, to, improve, the, situation, laws, were, implemented, in, mid, 1940, that, allowed, giving, short, camp, sentences, 4, months, or, a, year, to, those, convicted, of, petty, theft, hooliganism, or, labor, discipline, infractions, by, january, 1941, the, gulag, workforce, had, increased, by, approximately, 300, 000, prisoners, but, in, 1942, serious, food, shortages, began, and, camp, populations, dropped, again, the, camps, lost, still, more, prisoners, to, the, war, effort, as, the, soviet, union, went, into, a, total, war, footing, in, june, 1941, many, laborers, received, early, releases, so, that, they, could, be, drafted, and, sent, to, the, front, even, as, the, pool, of, workers, shrank, demand, for, outputs, continued, to, grow, rapidly, as, a, result, the, soviet, government, pushed, the, gulag, to, do, more, with, less, with, fewer, able, bodied, workers, and, few, supplies, from, outside, the, camp, system, camp, administrators, had, to, find, a, way, to, maintain, production, the, solution, they, found, was, to, push, the, remaining, prisoners, still, harder, the, nkvd, employed, a, system, of, setting, unrealistically, high, production, goals, straining, resources, in, an, attempt, to, encourage, higher, productivity, as, the, axis, armies, pushed, into, soviet, territory, from, june, 1941, on, labor, resources, became, further, strained, and, many, of, the, camps, had, to, evacuate, out, of, western, russia, from, the, beginning, of, the, war, to, halfway, through, 1944, 40, camps, were, set, up, and, 69, were, disbanded, during, evacuations, machinery, received, priority, leaving, prisoners, to, reach, safety, on, foot, the, speed, of, operation, barbarossa, s, advance, prevented, the, evacuation, of, all, prisoners, in, good, time, and, the, nkvd, massacred, many, to, prevent, them, from, falling, into, german, hands, while, this, practice, denied, the, germans, a, source, of, free, labor, it, also, further, restricted, the, gulag, s, capacity, to, keep, up, with, the, red, army, s, demands, when, the, tide, of, the, war, turned, however, and, the, soviets, started, pushing, the, axis, invaders, back, fresh, batches, of, laborers, replenished, the, camps, as, the, red, army, recaptured, territories, from, the, germans, an, influx, of, soviet, ex, pows, greatly, increased, the, gulag, population, after, world, war, ii, the, number, of, inmates, in, prison, camps, and, colonies, sharply, rose, again, reaching, approximately, 2, 5, million, people, by, the, early, 1950s, about, 1, 7, million, of, whom, were, in, camps, when, the, war, in, europe, ended, in, may, 1945, as, many, as, two, million, former, russian, citizens, were, forcefully, repatriated, into, the, ussr, on, february, 11, 1945, at, the, conclusion, of, the, yalta, conference, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom, signed, a, repatriation, agreement, with, the, soviet, union, one, interpretation, of, this, agreement, resulted, in, the, forcible, repatriation, of, all, soviets, british, and, united, states, civilian, authorities, ordered, their, military, forces, in, europe, to, deport, to, the, soviet, union, up, to, two, million, former, residents, of, the, soviet, union, including, persons, who, had, left, the, russian, empire, and, established, different, citizenship, years, before, the, forced, repatriation, operations, took, place, from, 1945, to, 1947, multiple, sources, state, that, soviet, pows, on, their, return, to, the, soviet, union, were, treated, as, traitors, see, order, no, 270, according, to, some, sources, over, 1, 5, million, surviving, red, army, soldiers, imprisoned, by, the, germans, were, sent, to, the, gulag, however, that, is, a, confusion, with, two, other, types, of, camps, during, and, after, world, war, ii, freed, pows, went, to, special, filtration, camps, of, these, by, 1944, more, than, 90, percent, were, cleared, and, about, 8, percent, were, arrested, or, condemned, to, penal, battalions, in, 1944, they, were, sent, directly, to, reserve, military, formations, to, be, cleared, by, the, nkvd, furthermore, in, 1945, about, 100, filtration, camps, were, set, for, repatriated, ostarbeiter, pows, and, other, displaced, persons, which, processed, more, than, 4, 000, 000, people, by, 1946, the, major, part, of, the, population, of, these, camps, were, cleared, by, nkvd, and, either, sent, home, or, conscripted, see, table, for, details, 226, 127, out, of, 1, 539, 475, pows, were, transferred, to, the, nkvd, i, e, the, gulag, after, nazi, germany, s, defeat, ten, nkvd, run, special, camps, subordinate, to, the, gulag, were, set, up, in, the, soviet, occupation, zone, of, post, war, germany, these, special, camps, were, former, stalags, prisons, or, nazi, concentration, camps, such, as, sachsenhausen, special, camp, number, 7, and, buchenwald, special, camp, number, 2, according, to, german, government, estimates, 65, 000, people, died, in, those, soviet, run, camps, or, in, transportation, to, them, according, to, german, researchers, sachsenhausen, where, 12, 500, soviet, era, victims, have, been, uncovered, should, be, seen, as, an, integral, part, of, the, gulag, system, yet, the, major, reason, for, the, post, war, increase, in, the, number, of, prisoners, was, the, tightening, of, legislation, on, property, offences, in, summer, 1947, at, this, time, there, was, a, famine, in, some, parts, of, the, soviet, union, claiming, about, 1, million, lives, which, resulted, in, hundreds, of, thousands, of, convictions, to, lengthy, prison, terms, sometimes, on, the, basis, of, cases, of, petty, theft, or, embezzlement, at, the, beginning, of, 1953, the, total, number, of, prisoners, in, prison, camps, was, more, than, 2, 4, million, of, which, more, than, 465, 000, were, political, prisoners, in, 1948, the, system, of, special, camps, was, established, exclusively, for, a, special, contingent, of, political, prisoners, convicted, according, to, the, more, severe, sub, articles, of, article, 58, enemies, of, people, treason, espionage, terrorism, etc, for, various, real, political, opponents, such, as, trotskyites, nationalists, ukrainian, nationalism, white, migr, as, well, as, for, fabricated, ones, the, state, continued, to, maintain, the, extensive, camp, system, for, a, while, after, stalin, s, death, in, march, 1953, although, the, period, saw, the, grip, of, the, camp, authorities, weaken, and, a, number, of, conflicts, and, uprisings, occur, see, bitch, wars, kengir, uprising, vorkuta, uprising, the, amnesty, of, 1953, was, limited, to, non, political, prisoners, and, for, political, prisoners, sentenced, to, not, more, than, 5, years, therefore, mostly, those, convicted, for, common, crimes, were, then, freed, the, release, of, political, prisoners, started, in, 1954, and, became, widespread, and, also, coupled, with, mass, rehabilitations, after, nikita, khrushchev, s, denunciation, of, stalinism, in, his, secret, speech, at, the, 20th, congress, of, the, cpsu, in, february, 1956, the, gulag, institution, was, closed, by, the, mvd, order, no, 020, of, january, 25, 1960, but, forced, labor, colonies, for, political, and, criminal, prisoners, continued, to, exist, political, prisoners, continued, to, be, kept, in, one, of, the, most, famous, camps, perm, 36, until, 1987, when, it, was, closed, the, russian, penal, system, despite, reforms, and, a, reduction, in, prison, population, informally, or, formally, continues, many, practices, endemic, to, the, gulag, system, including, forced, labor, inmates, policing, inmates, and, prisoner, intimidation, in, the, late, 2000s, some, human, rights, activists, accused, authorities, of, gradual, removal, of, gulag, remembrance, from, places, such, as, perm, 36, and, solovki, prison, camp, according, to, encyclop, dia, britannica, at, its, height, the, gulag, consisted, of, many, hundreds, of, camps, with, the, average, camp, holding, 2, 000, 10, 000, prisoners, most, of, these, camps, were, corrective, labour, colonies, in, which, prisoners, felled, timber, laboured, on, general, construction, projects, such, as, the, building, of, canals, and, railroads, or, worked, in, mines, most, prisoners, laboured, under, the, threat, of, starvation, or, execution, if, they, refused, it, is, estimated, that, the, combination, of, very, long, working, hours, harsh, climatic, and, other, working, conditions, inadequate, food, and, summary, executions, killed, tens, of, thousands, of, prisoners, each, year, western, scholarly, estimates, of, the, total, number, of, deaths, in, the, gulag, in, the, period, from, 1918, to, 1956, ranged, from, 1, 2, to, 1, 7, million, prior, to, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, estimates, of, gulag, victims, ranged, from, 2, 3, to, 17, 6, million, see, history, of, gulag, population, estimates, mortality, in, gulag, camps, in, 1934, 40, was, 4, 6, times, higher, than, average, in, the, soviet, union, post, 1991, research, by, historians, accessing, archival, materials, brought, this, range, down, considerably, in, a, 1993, study, of, archival, soviet, data, a, total, of, 1, 053, 829, people, died, in, the, gulag, from, 1934, to, 1953, 1024, it, was, common, practice, to, release, prisoners, who, were, either, suffering, from, incurable, diseases, or, near, death, so, a, combined, statistics, on, mortality, in, the, camps, and, mortality, caused, by, the, camps, was, higher, the, tentative, historical, consensus, is, that, of, the, 18, million, people, who, passed, through, the, gulag, from, 1930, to, 1953, between, 1, 6, million, and, 1, 76, million, perished, as, a, result, of, their, detention, and, about, half, of, all, deaths, occurred, between, 1941, and, 1943, following, the, german, invasion, timothy, snyder, writes, that, with, the, exception, of, the, war, years, a, very, large, majority, of, people, who, entered, the, gulag, left, alive, if, prisoner, deaths, from, labor, colonies, and, special, settlements, are, included, the, death, toll, rises, to, 2, 749, 163, according, to, j, otto, pohl, s, incomplete, data, in, her, 2018, study, golfo, alexopoulos, attempted, to, challenge, this, consensus, figure, by, encompassing, those, whose, life, was, shortened, due, to, gulag, conditions, alexopoulos, concluded, from, her, research, that, a, systematic, practice, of, the, gulag, was, to, release, sick, prisoners, on, the, verge, of, death, and, that, all, prisoners, who, received, the, health, classification, invalid, light, physical, labor, light, individualised, labor, or, physically, defective, that, together, according, to, alexopoulos, encompassed, at, least, one, third, of, all, inmates, who, passed, through, the, gulag, died, or, had, their, lives, shortened, due, to, detention, in, the, gulag, in, captivity, or, shortly, after, release, the, gulag, mortality, estimated, in, this, way, yields, the, figure, of, 6, million, deaths, historian, orlando, figes, and, russian, writer, vadim, erlikman, have, posited, similar, estimates, the, estimate, of, alexopoulos, however, has, obvious, methodological, difficulties, and, is, supported, by, misinterpreted, evidence, such, as, presuming, that, hundreds, of, thousands, of, prisoners, directed, to, other, places, of, detention, in, 1948, was, a, euphemism, for, releasing, prisoners, on, the, verge, of, death, into, labor, colonies, when, it, was, really, referring, to, internal, transport, in, the, gulag, rather, than, release, in, a, university, of, oxford, doctoral, dissertation, in, 2020, the, problem, of, medical, release, aktirovka, and, of, mortality, among, certified, invalids, aktirovannye, was, considered, in, detail, by, mikhail, nakonechnyi, he, concluded, that, the, number, of, terminally, ill, people, discharged, early, on, medical, grounds, from, the, gulag, was, about, 1, million, mikhail, added, 800, 000, 850, 000, excess, deaths, to, the, death, toll, directly, caused, by, the, results, of, gulag, incarceration, which, brings, the, death, toll, to, 2, 5, million, people, in, 2009, steven, rosefielde, stated, more, complete, archival, data, increases, camp, deaths, by, 19, 4, percent, to, 1, 258, 537, the, best, archivally, based, estimate, of, gulag, excess, deaths, at, present, is, 1, 6, million, from, 1929, to, 1953, dan, healey, in, 2018, also, stated, the, same, thing, new, studies, using, declassified, gulag, archives, have, provisionally, established, a, consensus, on, mortality, and, inhumanity, the, tentative, consensus, says, that, once, secret, records, of, the, gulag, administration, in, moscow, show, a, lower, death, toll, than, expected, from, memoir, sources, generally, between, 1, 5, and, 1, 7, million, out, of, 18, million, who, passed, through, for, the, years, from, 1930, to, 1953, certificates, of, death, in, the, gulag, system, for, the, period, from, 1930, to, 1956, living, and, working, conditions, in, the, camps, varied, significantly, across, time, and, place, depending, among, other, things, on, the, impact, of, broader, events, world, war, ii, countrywide, famines, and, shortages, waves, of, terror, sudden, influx, or, release, of, large, numbers, of, prisoners, and, the, type, of, crime, committed, instead, of, being, used, for, economic, gain, political, prisoners, were, typically, given, the, worst, work, or, were, dumped, into, the, less, productive, parts, of, the, gulag, for, example, victor, herman, in, his, memoirs, compares, the, burepolom, and, the, nuksha, 2, camps, which, were, both, near, vyatka, in, burepolom, there, were, roughly, 3, 000, prisoners, all, non, political, in, the, central, compound, they, could, walk, around, at, will, were, lightly, guarded, had, unlocked, barracks, with, mattresses, and, pillows, and, watched, western, movies, however, nuksha, 2, which, housed, serious, criminals, and, political, prisoners, featured, guard, towers, with, machine, guns, and, locked, barracks, in, some, camps, prisoners, were, only, permitted, to, send, one, letter, a, year, and, were, not, allowed, to, have, photos, of, loved, ones, some, prisoners, were, released, early, if, they, displayed, good, performance, there, were, several, productive, activities, for, prisoners, in, the, camps, for, example, in, early, 1935, a, course, in, livestock, raising, was, held, for, prisoners, at, a, state, farm, those, who, took, it, had, their, workday, reduced, to, four, hours, during, that, year, the, professional, theater, group, in, the, camp, complex, gave, 230, performances, of, plays, and, concerts, to, over, 115, 000, spectators, camp, newspapers, also, existed, andrei, vyshinsky, chief, procurator, of, the, soviet, union, wrote, a, memorandum, to, nkvd, chief, nikolai, yezhov, in, 1938, during, the, great, purge, which, stated, among, the, prisoners, there, are, some, so, ragged, and, lice, ridden, that, they, pose, a, sanitary, danger, to, the, rest, these, prisoners, have, deteriorated, to, the, point, of, losing, any, resemblance, to, human, beings, lacking, food, they, collect, orts, and, according, to, some, prisoners, eat, rats, and, dogs, according, to, prisoner, yevgenia, ginzburg, gulag, inmates, could, tell, when, yezhov, was, no, longer, in, charge, as, one, day, the, conditions, relaxed, a, few, days, later, beria, s, name, appeared, in, official, prison, notices, in, general, the, central, administrative, bodies, showed, a, discernible, interest, in, maintaining, the, labor, force, of, prisoners, in, a, condition, allowing, the, fulfilment, of, construction, and, production, plans, handed, down, from, above, besides, a, wide, array, of, punishments, for, prisoners, refusing, to, work, which, in, practice, were, sometimes, applied, to, prisoners, that, were, too, enfeebled, to, meet, production, quota, they, instituted, a, number, of, positive, incentives, intended, to, boost, productivity, these, included, monetary, bonuses, since, the, early, 1930s, and, wage, payments, from, 1950, onward, cuts, of, individual, sentences, general, early, release, schemes, for, norm, fulfilment, and, overfulfilment, until, 1939, again, in, selected, camps, from, 1946, onward, preferential, treatment, sentence, reduction, and, privileges, for, the, most, productive, workers, shock, workers, or, stakhanovites, in, soviet, parlance, inmates, were, used, as, camp, guards, and, could, purchase, camp, newspapers, as, well, as, bonds, robert, w, thurston, writes, that, this, was, at, least, an, indication, that, they, were, still, regarded, as, participants, in, society, to, some, degree, sports, team, particularly, football, teams, were, set, up, by, the, prison, authorities, boris, sulim, a, former, prisoner, who, had, worked, in, the, omsuchkan, camp, close, to, magadan, when, he, was, a, teenager, stated, i, was, 18, years, old, and, magadan, seemed, a, very, romantic, place, to, me, i, got, 880, rubles, a, month, and, a, 3000, ruble, installation, grant, which, was, a, hell, of, a, lot, of, money, for, a, kid, like, me, i, was, able, to, give, my, mother, some, of, it, they, even, gave, me, membership, in, the, komsomol, there, was, a, mining, and, ore, processing, plant, which, sent, out, parties, to, dig, for, tin, i, worked, at, the, radio, station, which, kept, contact, with, the, parties, if, the, inmates, were, good, and, disciplined, they, had, almost, the, same, rights, as, the, free, workers, they, were, trusted, and, they, even, went, to, the, movies, as, for, the, reason, they, were, in, the, camps, well, i, never, poked, my, nose, into, details, we, all, thought, the, people, were, there, because, they, were, guilty, immediately, after, the, german, attack, on, the, soviet, union, in, june, 1941, the, conditions, in, camps, worsened, drastically, quotas, were, increased, rations, cut, and, medical, supplies, came, close, to, none, all, of, which, led, to, a, sharp, increase, in, mortality, the, situation, slowly, improved, in, the, final, period, and, after, the, end, of, the, war, considering, the, overall, conditions, and, their, influence, on, inmates, it, is, important, to, distinguish, three, major, strata, of, gulag, inmates, the, soviet, famine, of, 1932, 1933, swept, across, many, different, regions, of, the, soviet, union, during, this, time, it, is, estimated, that, around, six, to, seven, million, people, starved, to, death, on, 7, august, 1932, a, new, decree, drafted, by, stalin, law, of, spikelets, specified, a, minimum, sentence, of, ten, years, or, execution, for, theft, from, collective, farms, or, of, cooperative, property, over, the, next, few, months, prosecutions, rose, fourfold, a, large, share, of, cases, prosecuted, under, the, law, were, for, the, theft, of, small, quantities, of, grain, worth, less, than, fifty, rubles, the, law, was, later, relaxed, on, 8, may, 1933, overall, during, the, first, half, of, 1933, prisons, saw, more, new, incoming, inmates, than, the, three, previous, years, combined, prisoners, in, the, camps, faced, harsh, working, conditions, one, soviet, report, stated, that, in, early, 1933, up, to, 15, of, the, prison, population, in, soviet, uzbekistan, died, monthly, during, this, time, prisoners, were, getting, around, 300, calories, 1, 300, kj, worth, of, food, a, day, many, inmates, attempted, to, flee, causing, an, upsurge, in, coercive, and, violent, measures, camps, were, directed, not, to, spare, bullets, the, convicts, in, such, camps, were, actively, involved, in, all, kinds, of, labor, with, one, of, them, being, logging, the, working, territory, of, logging, presented, by, itself, a, square, and, was, surrounded, by, forest, clearing, thus, all, attempts, to, exit, or, escape, from, it, were, well, observed, from, the, four, towers, set, at, each, of, its, corners, locals, who, captured, a, runaway, were, given, rewards, it, is, also, said, that, camps, in, colder, areas, were, less, concerned, with, finding, escaped, prisoners, as, they, would, die, anyhow, from, the, severely, cold, winters, in, such, cases, prisoners, who, did, escape, without, getting, shot, were, often, found, dead, kilometres, away, from, the, camp, in, the, early, days, of, gulag, the, locations, for, the, camps, were, chosen, primarily, for, the, isolated, conditions, involved, remote, monasteries, in, particular, were, frequently, reused, as, sites, for, new, camps, the, site, on, the, solovetsky, islands, in, the, white, sea, is, one, of, the, earliest, and, also, most, noteworthy, taking, root, soon, after, the, revolution, in, 1918, the, colloquial, name, for, the, islands, solovki, entered, the, vernacular, as, a, synonym, for, the, labor, camp, in, general, it, was, presented, to, the, world, as, an, example, of, the, new, soviet, method, for, re, education, of, class, enemies, and, reintegrating, them, through, labor, into, soviet, society, initially, the, inmates, largely, russian, intelligentsia, enjoyed, relative, freedom, within, the, natural, confinement, of, the, islands, local, newspapers, and, magazines, were, published, even, some, scientific, research, was, carried, out, e, g, a, local, botanical, garden, was, maintained, but, unfortunately, later, lost, completely, eventually, solovki, turned, into, an, ordinary, gulag, camp, some, historians, maintain, that, it, was, a, pilot, camp, of, this, type, in, 1929, maxim, gorky, visited, the, camp, and, published, an, apology, for, it, the, report, of, gorky, s, trip, to, solovki, was, included, in, the, cycle, of, impressions, titled, po, soiuzu, sovetov, part, v, subtitled, solovki, in, the, report, gorky, wrote, that, camps, such, as, solovki, were, absolutely, necessary, with, the, new, emphasis, on, gulag, as, the, means, of, concentrating, cheap, labor, new, camps, were, then, constructed, throughout, the, soviet, sphere, of, influence, wherever, the, economic, task, at, hand, dictated, their, existence, or, was, designed, specifically, to, avail, itself, of, them, such, as, the, white, sea, baltic, canal, or, the, baikal, amur, mainline, including, facilities, in, big, cities, parts, of, the, famous, moscow, metro, and, the, moscow, state, university, new, campus, were, built, by, forced, labor, many, more, projects, during, the, rapid, industrialisation, of, the, 1930s, war, time, and, post, war, periods, were, fulfilled, on, the, backs, of, convicts, the, activity, of, gulag, camps, spanned, a, wide, cross, section, of, soviet, industry, gorky, organized, in, 1933, a, trip, of, 120, writers, and, artists, to, the, white, sea, baltic, canal, 36, of, them, wrote, a, propaganda, book, about, the, construction, published, in, 1934, and, destroyed, in, 1937, the, majority, of, gulag, camps, were, positioned, in, extremely, remote, areas, of, northeastern, siberia, the, best, known, clusters, are, sevvostlag, the, north, east, camps, along, kolyma, river, and, norillag, near, norilsk, and, in, the, southeastern, parts, of, the, soviet, union, mainly, in, the, steppes, of, kazakhstan, luglag, steplag, peschanlag, a, detailed, map, was, made, by, the, memorial, foundation, these, were, vast, and, sparsely, inhabited, regions, with, no, roads, or, sources, of, food, but, rich, in, minerals, and, other, natural, resources, such, as, timber, the, construction, of, the, roads, was, assigned, to, the, inmates, of, specialised, railway, camps, camps, were, generally, spread, throughout, the, entire, soviet, union, including, the, european, parts, of, russia, belarus, and, ukraine, there, were, several, camps, outside, the, soviet, union, in, czechoslovakia, hungary, poland, and, mongolia, which, were, under, the, direct, control, of, the, gulag, throughout, the, history, of, the, soviet, union, there, were, at, least, 476, separate, camp, administrations, the, russian, researcher, galina, ivanova, stated, that, to, date, russian, historians, have, discovered, and, described, 476, camps, that, existed, at, different, times, on, the, territory, of, the, ussr, it, is, well, known, that, practically, every, one, of, them, had, several, branches, many, of, which, were, quite, large, in, addition, to, the, large, numbers, of, camps, there, were, no, less, than, 2, 000, colonies, it, would, be, virtually, impossible, to, reflect, the, entire, mass, of, gulag, facilities, on, a, map, that, would, also, account, for, the, various, times, of, their, existence, since, many, of, these, existed, only, for, short, periods, the, number, of, camp, administrations, at, any, given, point, was, lower, it, peaked, in, the, early, 1950s, when, there, were, more, than, 100, camp, administrations, across, the, soviet, union, most, camp, administrations, oversaw, several, single, camp, units, some, as, many, as, dozens, or, even, hundreds, the, infamous, complexes, were, those, at, kolyma, norilsk, and, vorkuta, all, in, arctic, or, subarctic, regions, however, prisoner, mortality, in, norilsk, in, most, periods, was, actually, lower, than, across, the, camp, system, as, a, whole, according, to, historian, stephen, barnes, the, origins, and, functions, of, the, gulag, can, be, looked, at, in, four, major, ways, hannah, arendt, argues, that, as, part, of, a, totalitarian, system, of, government, the, camps, of, the, gulag, system, were, experiments, in, total, domination, in, her, view, the, goal, of, a, totalitarian, system, was, not, merely, to, establish, limits, on, liberty, but, rather, to, abolish, liberty, entirely, in, service, of, its, ideology, she, argues, that, the, gulag, system, was, not, merely, political, repression, because, the, system, survived, and, grew, long, after, stalin, had, wiped, out, all, serious, political, resistance, although, the, various, camps, were, initially, filled, with, criminals, and, political, prisoners, eventually, they, were, filled, with, prisoners, who, were, arrested, irrespective, of, anything, relating, to, them, as, individuals, but, rather, only, on, the, basis, of, their, membership, in, some, ever, shifting, category, of, imagined, threats, to, the, state, 437, 59, she, also, argues, that, the, function, of, the, gulag, system, was, not, truly, economic, although, the, soviet, government, deemed, them, all, forced, labor, camps, this, in, fact, highlighted, that, the, work, in, the, camps, was, deliberately, pointless, since, all, russian, workers, could, be, subject, to, forced, labor, 444, 5, the, only, real, economic, purpose, they, typically, served, was, financing, the, cost, of, their, own, supervision, otherwise, the, work, performed, was, generally, useless, either, by, design, or, made, that, way, through, extremely, poor, planning, and, execution, some, workers, even, preferred, more, difficult, work, if, it, was, actually, productive, she, differentiated, between, authentic, forced, labor, camps, concentration, camps, and, annihilation, camps, 444, 5, in, authentic, labor, camps, inmates, worked, in, relative, freedom, and, are, sentenced, for, limited, periods, concentration, camps, had, extremely, high, mortality, rates, and, but, were, still, essentially, organized, for, labor, purposes, annihilation, camps, were, those, where, the, inmates, were, systematically, wiped, out, through, starvation, and, neglect, she, criticizes, other, commentators, conclusion, that, the, purpose, of, the, camps, was, a, supply, of, cheap, labor, according, to, her, the, soviets, were, able, to, liquidate, the, camp, system, without, serious, economic, consequences, showing, that, the, camps, were, not, an, important, source, of, labor, and, were, overall, economically, irrelevant, 444, 5, arendt, argues, that, together, with, the, systematized, arbitrary, cruelty, inside, the, camps, this, served, the, purpose, of, total, domination, by, eliminating, the, idea, that, the, arrestees, had, any, political, or, legal, rights, morality, was, destroyed, by, maximizing, cruelty, and, by, organizing, the, camps, internally, to, make, the, inmates, and, guards, complicit, the, terror, resulting, from, the, operation, of, the, gulag, system, caused, people, outside, of, the, camps, to, cut, all, ties, with, anyone, who, was, arrested, or, purged, and, to, avoid, forming, ties, with, others, for, fear, of, being, associated, with, anyone, who, was, targeted, as, a, result, the, camps, were, essential, as, the, nucleus, of, a, system, that, destroyed, individuality, and, dissolved, all, social, bonds, thereby, the, system, attempted, to, eliminate, any, capacity, for, resistance, or, self, directed, action, in, the, greater, population, 437, 59, statistical, reports, made, by, the, ogpu, nkvd, mgb, mvd, between, the, 1930s, and, 1950s, are, kept, in, the, state, archive, of, the, russian, federation, formerly, called, central, state, archive, of, the, october, revolution, csaor, these, documents, were, highly, classified, and, inaccessible, amid, glasnost, and, democratization, in, the, late, 1980s, viktor, zemskov, and, other, russian, researchers, managed, to, gain, access, to, the, documents, and, published, the, highly, classified, statistical, data, collected, by, the, ogpu, nkvd, mgb, mvd, and, related, to, the, number, of, the, gulag, prisoners, special, settlers, etc, in, 1995, zemskov, wrote, that, foreign, scientists, have, begun, to, be, admitted, to, the, restricted, access, collection, of, these, documents, in, the, state, archive, of, the, russian, federation, since, 1992, however, only, one, historian, namely, zemskov, was, admitted, to, these, archives, and, later, the, archives, were, again, closed, according, to, leonid, lopatnikov, pressure, from, the, putin, administration, has, exacerbated, the, difficulties, of, gulag, researchers, while, considering, the, issue, of, reliability, of, the, primary, data, provided, by, corrective, labor, institutions, it, is, necessary, to, take, into, account, the, following, two, circumstances, on, the, one, hand, their, administration, was, not, interested, to, understate, the, number, of, prisoners, in, its, reports, because, it, would, have, automatically, led, to, a, decrease, in, the, food, supply, plan, for, camps, prisons, and, corrective, labor, colonies, the, decrement, in, food, would, have, been, accompanied, by, an, increase, in, mortality, that, would, have, led, to, wrecking, of, the, vast, production, program, of, the, gulag, on, the, other, hand, overstatement, of, data, of, the, number, of, prisoners, also, did, not, comply, with, departmental, interests, because, it, was, fraught, with, the, same, i, e, impossible, increase, in, production, tasks, set, by, planning, bodies, in, those, days, people, were, highly, responsible, for, non, fulfilment, of, plan, it, seems, that, a, resultant, of, these, objective, departmental, interests, was, a, sufficient, degree, of, reliability, of, the, reports, between, 1990, and, 1992, the, first, precise, statistical, data, on, the, gulag, based, on, the, gulag, archives, were, published, by, viktor, zemskov, these, had, been, generally, accepted, by, leading, western, scholars, despite, the, fact, that, a, number, of, inconsistencies, were, found, in, this, statistics, not, all, the, conclusions, drawn, by, zemskov, based, on, his, data, have, been, generally, accepted, thus, sergei, maksudov, alleged, that, although, literary, sources, for, example, the, books, of, lev, razgon, or, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, did, not, envisage, the, total, number, of, the, camps, very, well, and, markedly, exaggerated, their, size, on, the, other, hand, viktor, zemskov, who, published, many, documents, by, the, nkvd, and, kgb, was, far, from, understanding, of, the, gulag, essence, and, the, nature, of, socio, political, processes, in, the, country, he, added, that, without, distinguishing, the, degree, of, accuracy, and, reliability, of, certain, figures, without, making, a, critical, analysis, of, sources, without, comparing, new, data, with, already, known, information, zemskov, absolutizes, the, published, materials, by, presenting, them, as, the, ultimate, truth, as, a, result, maksudov, charges, that, zemskov, s, attempts, to, make, generalized, statements, with, reference, to, a, particular, document, as, a, rule, do, not, hold, water, in, response, zemskov, wrote, that, the, charge, that, he, allegedly, did, not, compare, new, data, with, already, known, information, could, not, be, called, fair, in, his, words, the, trouble, with, most, western, writers, is, that, they, do, not, benefit, from, such, comparisons, zemskov, added, that, when, he, tried, not, to, overuse, the, juxtaposition, of, new, information, with, old, one, it, was, only, because, of, a, sense, of, delicacy, not, to, once, again, psychologically, traumatize, the, researchers, whose, works, used, incorrect, figures, as, it, turned, out, after, the, publication, of, the, statistics, by, the, ogpu, nkvd, mgb, mvd, according, to, french, historian, nicolas, werth, the, mountains, of, the, materials, of, the, gulag, archives, which, are, stored, in, funds, of, the, state, archive, of, the, russian, federation, and, were, being, constantly, exposed, during, the, last, fifteen, years, represent, only, a, very, small, part, of, bureaucratic, prose, of, immense, size, left, over, after, the, decades, of, creativity, by, the, dull, and, reptile, organization, managing, the, gulag, in, many, cases, local, camp, archives, which, had, been, stored, in, sheds, barracks, or, other, rapidly, disintegrating, buildings, simply, disappeared, in, the, same, way, as, most, of, the, camp, buildings, did, in, 2004, and, 2005, some, archival, documents, were, published, in, the, edition, istoriya, stalinskogo, gulaga, konets, 1920, kh, pervaya, polovina, 1950, kh, godov, sobranie, dokumentov, v, 7, tomakh, the, history, of, stalin, s, gulag, from, the, late, 1920s, to, the, first, half, of, the, 1950s, collection, of, documents, in, seven, volumes, wherein, each, of, its, seven, volumes, covered, a, particular, issue, indicated, in, the, title, of, the, volume, the, edition, contains, the, brief, introductions, by, the, two, patriarchs, of, the, gulag, science, robert, conquest, and, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, and, 1, 431, documents, the, overwhelming, majority, of, which, were, obtained, from, funds, of, the, state, archive, of, the, russian, federation, during, the, decades, before, the, dissolution, of, the, ussr, the, debates, about, the, population, size, of, gulag, failed, to, arrive, at, generally, accepted, figures, wide, ranging, estimates, have, been, offered, and, the, bias, toward, higher, or, lower, side, was, sometimes, ascribed, to, political, views, of, the, particular, author, some, of, those, earlier, estimates, both, high, and, low, are, shown, in, the, table, below, the, glasnost, political, reforms, in, the, late, 1980s, and, the, subsequent, dissolution, of, the, ussr, led, to, the, release, of, a, large, amount, of, formerly, classified, archival, documents, including, new, demographic, and, nkvd, data, analysis, of, the, official, gulag, statistics, by, western, scholars, immediately, demonstrated, that, despite, their, inconsistency, they, do, not, support, previously, published, higher, estimates, importantly, the, released, documents, made, possible, to, clarify, terminology, used, to, describe, different, categories, of, forced, labor, population, because, the, use, of, the, terms, forced, labor, gulag, camps, interchangeably, by, early, researchers, led, to, significant, confusion, and, resulted, in, significant, inconsistencies, in, the, earlier, estimates, archival, studies, revealed, several, components, of, the, nkvd, penal, system, in, the, stalinist, ussr, prisons, labor, camps, labor, colonies, as, well, as, various, settlements, exile, and, of, non, custodial, forced, labor, although, most, of, them, fit, the, definition, of, forced, labor, only, labor, camps, and, labor, colonies, were, associated, with, punitive, forced, labor, in, detention, forced, labor, camps, gulag, camps, were, hard, regime, camps, whose, inmates, were, serving, more, than, three, year, terms, as, a, rule, they, were, situated, in, remote, parts, of, the, ussr, and, labor, conditions, were, extremely, hard, there, they, formed, a, core, of, the, gulag, system, the, inmates, of, corrective, labor, colonies, served, shorter, terms, these, colonies, were, located, in, less, remote, parts, of, the, ussr, and, they, were, run, by, local, nkvd, administration, preliminary, analysis, of, the, gulag, camps, and, colonies, statistics, see, the, chart, on, the, right, demonstrated, that, the, population, reached, the, maximum, before, the, world, war, ii, then, dropped, sharply, partially, due, to, massive, releases, partially, due, to, wartime, high, mortality, and, then, was, gradually, increasing, until, the, end, of, stalin, era, reaching, the, global, maximum, in, 1953, when, the, combined, population, of, gulag, camps, and, labor, colonies, amounted, to, 2, 625, 000, the, results, of, these, archival, studies, convinced, many, scholars, including, robert, conquest, or, stephen, wheatcroft, to, reconsider, their, earlier, estimates, of, the, size, of, the, gulag, population, although, the, high, numbers, of, arrested, and, deaths, are, not, radically, different, from, earlier, estimates, although, such, scholars, as, rosefielde, or, vishnevsky, point, at, several, inconsistencies, in, archival, data, with, rosefielde, pointing, out, the, archival, figure, of, 1, 196, 369, for, the, population, of, the, gulag, and, labor, colonies, combined, on, december, 31, 1936, is, less, than, half, the, 2, 75, million, labor, camp, population, given, to, the, census, board, by, the, nkvd, for, the, 1937, census, it, is, generally, believed, that, these, data, provide, more, reliable, and, detailed, information, that, the, indirect, data, and, literary, sources, available, for, the, scholars, during, the, cold, war, era, although, conquest, cited, beria, s, report, to, the, politburo, of, the, labor, camp, numbers, at, the, end, of, 1938, stating, there, were, almost, 7, million, prisoners, in, the, labor, camps, more, than, three, times, the, archival, figure, for, 1938, and, an, official, report, to, stalin, by, the, soviet, minister, of, state, security, in, 1952, stating, there, were, 12, million, prisoners, in, the, labor, camps, these, data, allowed, scholars, to, conclude, that, during, the, period, of, 1928, 53, about, 14, million, prisoners, passed, through, the, system, of, gulag, labor, camps, and, 4, 5, million, passed, through, the, labor, colonies, thus, these, figures, reflect, the, number, of, convicted, persons, and, do, not, take, into, account, the, fact, that, a, significant, part, of, gulag, inmates, had, been, convicted, more, than, one, time, so, the, actual, number, of, convicted, is, somewhat, overstated, by, these, statistics, from, other, hand, during, some, periods, of, gulag, history, the, official, figures, of, gulag, population, reflected, the, camps, capacity, not, the, actual, number, of, inmates, so, the, actual, figures, were, 15, higher, in, e, g, 1946, the, ussr, implemented, a, number, of, labor, disciplinary, measures, due, to, the, lack, of, productivity, of, its, labour, force, in, the, early, 1930s, 1, 8, million, workers, were, sentenced, to, 6, months, in, forced, labor, with, a, quarter, of, their, original, pay, 3, 3, million, faced, sanctions, and, 60k, were, imprisoned, for, absentees, in, 1940, alone, the, conditions, of, soviet, workers, worsened, in, ww2, as, 1, 3, million, were, punished, in, 1942, and, 1, million, each, were, punished, in, subsequent, 1943, and, 1944, with, the, reduction, of, 25, of, food, rations, further, more, 460, thousand, were, imprisoned, throughout, these, years, the, gulag, spanned, nearly, four, decades, of, soviet, and, east, european, history, and, affected, millions, of, individuals, its, cultural, impact, was, enormous, the, gulag, has, become, a, major, influence, on, contemporary, russian, thinking, and, an, important, part, of, modern, russian, folklore, many, songs, by, the, authors, performers, known, as, the, bards, most, notably, vladimir, vysotsky, and, alexander, galich, neither, of, whom, ever, served, time, in, the, camps, describe, life, inside, the, gulag, and, glorified, the, life, of, zeks, words, and, phrases, which, originated, in, the, labor, camps, became, part, of, the, russian, soviet, vernacular, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, memoirs, of, alexander, dolgun, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, varlam, shalamov, and, yevgenia, ginzburg, among, others, became, a, symbol, of, defiance, in, soviet, society, these, writings, harshly, chastised, the, soviet, people, for, their, tolerance, and, apathy, regarding, the, gulag, but, at, the, same, time, provided, a, testament, to, the, courage, and, resolve, of, those, who, were, imprisoned, another, cultural, phenomenon, in, the, soviet, union, linked, with, the, gulag, was, the, forced, migration, of, many, artists, and, other, people, of, culture, to, siberia, this, resulted, in, a, renaissance, of, sorts, in, places, like, magadan, where, for, example, the, quality, of, theatre, production, was, comparable, to, moscow, s, and, eddie, rosner, played, jazz, many, eyewitness, accounts, of, gulag, prisoners, have, been, published, soviet, state, documents, show, that, the, goals, of, the, gulag, included, colonization, of, sparsely, populated, remote, areas, and, exploiting, its, resources, using, forced, labor, in, 1929, ogpu, was, given, the, task, to, colonize, these, areas, to, this, end, the, notion, of, free, settlement, was, introduced, on, 12, april, 1930, genrikh, yagoda, wrote, to, the, ogpu, commission, the, camps, must, be, transformed, into, colonizing, settlements, without, waiting, for, the, end, of, periods, of, confinement, here, is, my, plan, to, turn, all, the, prisoners, into, a, settler, population, until, they, have, served, their, sentences, when, well, behaved, persons, had, served, the, majority, of, their, terms, they, could, be, released, for, free, settlement, volnoye, poseleniye, outside, the, confinement, of, the, camp, they, were, known, as, free, settlers, volnoposelentsy, not, to, be, confused, with, the, term, ssyl, noposelentsy, exile, settlers, in, addition, for, persons, who, served, full, term, but, who, were, denied, the, free, choice, of, place, of, residence, it, was, recommended, to, assign, them, for, free, settlement, and, give, them, land, in, the, general, vicinity, of, the, place, of, confinement, the, gulag, inherited, this, approach, from, the, katorga, system, it, is, estimated, that, of, the, 40, 000, people, collecting, state, pensions, in, vorkuta, 32, 000, are, trapped, former, gulag, inmates, or, their, descendants, persons, who, served, a, term, in, a, camp, or, prison, were, restricted, from, taking, a, wide, range, of, jobs, concealment, of, a, previous, imprisonment, was, a, triable, offence, persons, who, served, terms, as, politicals, were, nuisances, for, first, departments, pervyj, otdel, outlets, of, the, secret, police, at, all, enterprises, and, institutions, because, former, politicals, had, to, be, monitored, many, people, who, were, released, from, camps, were, restricted, from, settling, in, larger, cities, both, moscow, and, st, petersburg, have, memorials, to, the, victims, of, the, gulag, made, of, boulders, from, the, solovki, camp, the, first, prison, camp, in, the, gulag, system, moscow, s, memorial, is, on, lubyanka, square, the, site, of, the, headquarters, of, the, nkvd, people, gather, at, these, memorials, every, year, on, the, day, of, victims, of, the, repression, october, 30, moscow, has, the, state, gulag, museum, whose, first, director, was, anton, antonov, ovseyenko, in, 2015, another, museum, dedicated, to, the, gulag, was, opened, in, moscow
