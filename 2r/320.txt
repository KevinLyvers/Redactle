the, duchy, of, burgundy, b, r, n, d, i, latin, ducatus, burgundiae, french, duch, de, bourgogne, emerged, in, the, 9th, century, as, one, of, the, successors, of, the, ancient, kingdom, of, the, burgundians, which, after, its, conquest, in, 532, had, formed, a, constituent, part, of, the, frankish, empire, upon, the, 9th, century, partitions, the, french, remnants, of, the, burgundian, kingdom, were, reduced, to, a, ducal, rank, by, king, robert, ii, of, france, in, 1004, robert, ii, s, son, and, heir, king, henry, i, of, france, inherited, the, duchy, but, ceded, it, to, his, younger, brother, robert, in, 1032, the, other, portions, of, the, kingdom, of, the, burgundians, had, passed, to, the, imperial, kingdom, of, burgundy, arles, including, the, county, of, burgundy, franche, comt, robert, became, the, ancestor, of, the, ducal, house, of, burgundy, a, cadet, branch, of, the, royal, capet, dynasty, ruling, over, a, territory, that, roughly, conformed, to, the, borders, and, territories, of, the, modern, region, of, burgundy, bourgogne, upon, the, extinction, of, the, burgundian, male, line, with, the, death, of, duke, philip, i, in, 1361, the, duchy, reverted, to, king, john, ii, of, france, and, the, royal, house, of, valois, the, burgundian, duchy, was, absorbed, in, a, larger, territorial, complex, after, 1363, when, king, john, ii, ceded, the, duchy, to, his, younger, son, philip, with, his, marriage, with, countess, margaret, iii, of, flanders, he, laid, the, foundation, for, a, burgundian, state, which, expanded, further, north, in, the, low, countries, collectively, known, as, the, burgundian, netherlands, upon, further, acquisitions, of, the, county, of, burgundy, holland, and, luxemburg, the, house, of, valois, burgundy, came, into, possession, of, numerous, french, and, imperial, fiefs, stretching, from, the, western, alps, to, the, north, sea, in, some, ways, reminiscent, of, the, middle, frankish, realm, of, lotharingia, the, burgundian, state, in, its, own, right, was, one, of, the, largest, ducal, territories, that, existed, at, the, time, of, the, emergence, of, early, modern, europe, after, just, over, one, hundred, years, of, valois, burgundy, rule, however, the, last, duke, charles, the, bold, rushed, to, the, burgundian, wars, and, was, killed, in, the, 1477, battle, of, nancy, the, extinction, of, the, dynasty, led, to, the, absorption, of, the, duchy, itself, into, the, french, crown, lands, by, king, louis, xi, while, the, bulk, of, the, burgundian, possessions, in, the, low, countries, passed, to, charles, daughter, mary, and, her, habsburg, descendants, the, duchy, of, burgundy, was, a, successor, of, the, earlier, kingdom, of, the, burgundians, which, evolved, out, of, territories, ruled, by, the, burgundians, an, east, germanic, tribe, that, arrived, in, gaul, in, the, 5th, century, the, burgundians, settled, in, the, area, around, dijon, chalon, sur, sa, ne, m, con, autun, and, ch, tillon, sur, seine, and, gave, the, name, to, the, region, the, kingdom, of, the, burgundians, was, annexed, by, the, merovingian, king, of, the, franks, childebert, i, in, 534, following, their, defeat, by, the, franks, it, was, recreated, however, on, several, occasions, when, frankish, territories, were, redivided, between, the, sons, on, the, death, of, a, frankish, king, as, part, of, the, kingdom, of, the, franks, burgundy, maintained, a, semi, autonomous, existence, with, the, burgundians, maintaining, their, own, law, code, the, loi, gombette, however, southern, burgundy, was, pillaged, by, the, saracen, invasion, of, the, 8th, century, when, charles, martel, drove, the, invaders, out, he, divided, burgundy, into, four, commands, arles, burgundy, vienne, burgundy, alamanic, burgundy, and, frankish, burgundy, he, appointed, his, brother, childebrand, governor, of, frankish, burgundy, under, the, carolingians, burgundian, separatism, lessened, and, burgundy, became, a, purely, geographical, term, referring, only, to, the, area, of, the, counties, of, the, former, burgundy, both, the, duchy, of, burgundy, and, the, county, of, burgundy, emerged, from, these, counties, aided, by, the, collapse, of, carolingian, centralism, and, the, division, of, the, frankish, domains, brought, about, by, the, partition, of, verdun, in, 843, in, the, midst, of, this, confusion, guerin, of, provence, attached, himself, to, charles, the, bald, youngest, son, of, king, louis, the, pious, of, the, franks, and, aided, him, in, the, battle, of, fontenay, against, charles, s, eldest, brother, the, emperor, lothar, when, the, frankish, kingdom, in, the, west, was, divided, along, the, boundary, of, the, sa, ne, and, meuse, dividing, geographical, burgundy, in, the, process, guerin, was, rewarded, for, his, services, by, the, king, by, being, granted, the, administration, of, the, counties, of, chalon, and, nevers, in, which, he, was, by, custom, expected, to, appoint, viscounts, to, rule, as, his, deputies, as, a, vital, military, defender, of, the, west, frankish, border, guerin, was, sometimes, known, by, the, latin, term, for, leader, dux, or, duke, by, the, time, of, richard, the, justiciar, d, 921, the, duchy, of, burgundy, was, beginning, to, emerge, richard, was, officially, recognised, by, the, king, as, a, duke, he, also, stood, as, individual, count, of, each, county, he, held, if, it, was, not, held, on, his, behalf, by, a, viscount, as, duke, of, burgundy, he, was, able, to, wield, an, increasing, amount, of, power, over, his, territory, the, term, that, came, to, be, applied, to, the, collective, body, of, a, duke, s, territory, was, ducatus, included, in, the, richard, s, ducatus, were, the, regions, of, autunais, beaunois, avalois, lassois, dijonais, memontois, attuyer, oscheret, auxois, duesmois, auxerrois, nivernais, chaunois, and, massois, under, richard, these, territories, were, given, law, and, order, protected, from, the, normans, and, served, as, a, haven, for, persecuted, monks, under, rudolph, of, france, also, raoul, or, ralph, the, son, of, richard, burgundy, was, briefly, catapulted, to, a, position, of, prominence, in, france, since, he, became, king, of, france, in, 923, after, acceding, to, the, burgundian, territories, in, 921, it, was, from, his, territories, in, burgundy, that, he, drew, the, resources, needed, to, fight, those, who, challenged, his, right, to, rule, under, hugh, the, black, d, 952, came, the, beginning, of, what, would, be, a, long, and, troubled, saga, for, burgundy, his, neighbours, were, the, robertian, family, who, held, the, title, of, duke, of, francia, this, family, wanting, to, improve, their, standing, in, france, and, against, the, carolingian, kings, attempted, to, subject, the, duchy, to, the, suzerainty, of, their, own, duchy, they, failed, eventually, when, they, appeared, close, to, success, they, were, forced, to, scrap, the, scheme, and, instead, maintain, burgundy, as, a, separate, duchy, two, brothers, of, hugh, capet, the, first, capetian, king, of, france, took, up, the, rule, of, burgundy, as, duke, first, otto, and, then, henry, the, venerable, maintained, the, duchy, s, independence, but, the, death, of, the, latter, without, children, proved, a, defining, moment, in, the, history, of, the, duchy, henry, the, venerable, died, in, 1002, leaving, two, potential, heirs, his, nephew, robert, the, pious, king, of, france, and, his, stepson, otto, william, count, of, m, con, kingdom, of, france, and, count, of, burgundy, kingdom, of, burgundy, whom, henry, had, adopted, robert, claimed, the, duchy, by, his, dual, rights, as, feudal, overlord, and, nearest, blood, relative, of, the, deceased, otto, william, disputed, his, claim, as, a, potential, heir, starting, a, war, with, the, help, of, his, son, in, law, landry, count, of, nevers, had, the, two, burgundys, been, united, history, would, undoubtedly, have, taken, a, different, course, a, burgundy, united, under, the, german, otto, william, would, have, been, within, the, sphere, of, influence, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, would, have, affected, the, balance, of, power, between, the, french, and, the, germans, however, it, was, not, to, be, although, it, took, him, thirteen, years, of, bitter, and, prolonged, battle, robert, eventually, secured, the, duchy, for, the, french, crown, by, gaining, control, of, all, the, burgundian, counties, west, of, the, sa, ne, including, dijon, prospects, of, a, united, burgundy, evaporated, and, the, duchy, became, irreversibly, french, in, outlook, for, a, time, the, duchy, formed, part, of, the, royal, domain, but, the, french, crown, could, not, hope, at, this, time, to, administer, such, a, volatile, territory, the, realities, of, power, combined, with, capetian, family, feuding, robert, the, pious, gave, the, territory, to, his, younger, son, and, namesake, robert, i, duke, of, burgundy, when, king, henry, i, of, france, acceding, in, difficult, circumstances, 1031, found, it, necessary, to, secure, the, loyalty, of, robert, his, brother, he, further, enhanced, the, rights, given, to, his, brother, 1032, robert, was, to, be, duke, of, burgundy, as, ruler, of, the, duchy, he, would, enjoy, the, freehold, thereof, and, have, the, right, to, pass, it, on, to, his, heirs, future, dukes, were, to, owe, allegiance, only, to, the, crown, of, france, and, be, overlords, of, the, duchy, beneath, the, ultimate, authority, of, the, kings, of, france, robert, gladly, agreed, to, this, arrangement, and, the, era, of, the, capetian, dukes, began, robert, found, that, it, was, largely, a, theoretical, power, that, he, had, been, granted, between, the, reign, of, richard, the, justiciar, and, henry, the, venerable, the, duchy, had, fallen, into, anarchy, a, condition, heightened, by, the, war, of, succession, between, robert, the, pious, and, count, otto, william, the, dukes, had, given, away, most, of, their, lands, to, secure, the, loyalty, of, their, vassals, consequently, they, lacked, power, in, the, duchy, without, the, support, and, obedience, of, their, vassals, in, addition, the, abbot, of, cluny, claimed, immunity, from, secular, overlords, while, the, bishop, of, langres, was, a, duke, and, peer, of, france, robert, and, his, heirs, were, faced, with, the, task, of, restoring, the, ducal, demesne, and, strengthening, ducal, power, in, this, it, would, be, seen, the, dukes, were, well, suited, to, the, task, none, were, remarkable, or, outstanding, men, who, swept, all, opposition, away, before, them, rather, they, were, persevering, methodical, realistic, able, and, willing, to, seize, any, opportunity, presented, to, them, they, used, the, law, of, escheat, to, their, advantage, auxois, and, duesmois, fell, into, ducal, hands, through, reversion, these, feudatories, having, no, heir, able, to, administer, them, they, purchased, both, land, and, vassalage, which, built, up, both, the, ducal, demesne, and, the, number, of, vassals, dependent, upon, the, dukes, they, made, an, income, for, themselves, by, demanding, cash, payments, in, exchange, for, recognition, of, a, lord, s, feudal, rights, within, the, duchy, by, skillful, management, of, loans, from, jewish, and, lombard, bankers, by, the, careful, administration, of, feudal, dues, and, by, the, ready, sale, of, immunities, and, justice, the, duchy, itself, benefited, from, the, rule, of, the, capetians, as, time, passed, the, state, was, built, up, and, stabilised, a, miniature, court, in, imitation, of, the, royal, court, at, paris, grew, around, the, dukes, the, jours, generaux, a, replica, of, the, parlement, of, paris, sat, at, beaune, bailiffs, were, imposed, over, the, provosts, and, lords, of, the, manor, responsible, for, local, government, while, the, duchy, was, divided, into, five, bailiwicks, the, duchy, became, increasingly, involved, in, the, reconquista, in, spain, at, the, end, of, the, eleventh, century, campaigning, against, muslim, taifas, and, forming, marriage, alliances, with, the, spanish, royalty, robert, s, daughter, constance, married, king, alfonso, vi, of, le, n, and, castile, and, his, grandson, henry, married, theresa, of, le, n, to, found, the, portuguese, house, of, burgundy, with, the, advent, of, first, crusade, the, attention, of, burgundian, dukes, shifted, to, the, holy, land, and, odo, i, duke, of, burgundy, died, during, the, crusade, of, 1101, under, the, competent, leadership, of, robert, ii, r, 1271, 1306, one, of, the, more, notable, dukes, of, the, capetian, period, burgundy, reached, new, levels, of, political, and, economic, prominence, previously, the, development, of, the, duchy, had, been, impeded, by, the, bestowal, of, minor, lands, and, titles, on, younger, sons, and, daughters, diminishing, the, ducal, fisc, robert, firmly, ended, this, practice, stating, in, his, will, that, he, left, to, his, eldest, son, and, heir, hugh, and, after, hugh, to, his, heir, all, the, fiefs, former, fiefs, seigneuries, and, revenue, belonging, to, the, duchy, the, younger, children, of, robert, would, receive, only, annuities, since, these, derived, from, property, held, by, hugh, these, younger, children, would, need, to, owe, liege, homage, to, ensure, their, income, hugh, v, died, in, 1315, his, brother, odo, iv, succeeded, himself, the, grandson, of, king, louis, ix, of, france, by, his, mother, agnes, of, france, he, would, also, be, the, brother, in, law, of, two, french, kings, louis, x, married, to, his, sister, marguerite, and, philip, vi, married, to, his, sister, joan, and, the, son, in, law, of, a, third, philip, v, whose, daughter, joan, iii, countess, of, burgundy, he, married, previous, attempts, to, gain, territory, through, marriage, hugh, iii, and, the, dauphin, odo, iii, and, nivernais, hugh, iv, and, the, bourbonnais, had, failed, odo, iv, s, wife, joan, however, was, sovereign, countess, of, burgundy, and, artois, and, the, marriage, reunited, the, burgundys, again, they, were, not, however, reunited, for, long, the, marriage, of, duke, odo, and, countess, joan, in, 1318, produced, only, one, surviving, child, philip, he, married, another, joan, the, heiress, of, auvergne, and, boulogne, but, they, again, only, produced, a, single, surviving, child, philip, i, duke, of, burgundy, also, known, as, philip, of, rouvres, the, elder, philip, predeceased, both, of, his, parents, in, an, accident, with, a, horse, in, 1346, countess, joan, iii, followed, him, to, the, grave, a, year, later, and, the, death, of, odo, iv, in, 1349, left, the, survival, of, the, duchy, dependent, upon, the, survival, of, the, young, duke, a, young, child, of, two, and, a, half, and, the, last, of, the, direct, line, of, descent, from, duke, robert, i, by, inheritance, philip, of, rouvres, was, duke, of, burgundy, from, 1349, he, had, already, been, count, of, burgundy, and, artois, since, the, death, of, his, grandmother, the, countess, joan, of, burgundy, and, artois, in, 1347, in, practice, though, the, duke, his, grandfather, had, continued, to, rule, over, these, counties, as, he, had, done, since, his, marriage, to, countess, joan, philip, of, rouvres, being, only, a, baby, with, the, old, duke, s, death, the, duchy, and, its, associated, territories, were, governed, by, the, young, duke, s, mother, joan, i, countess, of, auvergne, and, boulogne, and, by, her, second, husband, king, john, the, good, of, france, richer, promises, were, made, to, the, young, duke, he, could, expect, to, inherit, auvergne, and, boulogne, on, his, mother, s, death, and, a, marriage, was, arranged, between, himself, and, the, young, heiress, of, flanders, margaret, of, dampierre, who, could, promise, to, bring, flanders, and, brabant, to, her, husband, eventually, by, 1361, aged, 17, he, appeared, to, be, on, track, to, continue, the, duchy, s, steady, rise, to, greatness, it, was, not, to, be, however, philip, became, ill, with, the, plague, a, disease, that, all, but, inevitably, promised, a, swift, and, agonising, death, fully, expecting, to, die, the, young, duke, made, his, last, will, and, testament, on, 11, november, 1361, ten, days, later, he, was, dead, and, with, him, his, dynasty, even, before, philip, s, death, france, and, burgundy, had, begun, considering, the, knotty, problem, of, the, succession, by, the, terms, of, his, will, the, duke, had, stated, that, he, directed, and, appointed, as, heirs, to, his, county, and, to, our, possessions, whatever, they, may, be, those, male, and, female, who, by, law, or, local, custom, ought, or, may, inherit, since, his, domains, all, practiced, succession, by, primogeniture, there, was, no, question, of, his, dominions, passing, en, bloc, to, any, one, man, or, woman, they, had, come, to, philip, of, rouvres, by, different, paths, of, inheritance, and, so, by, the, customs, of, the, territories, they, were, required, to, pass, to, the, next, in, line, to, inherit, in, each, respective, territory, the, counties, of, auvergne, and, boulogne, inherited, by, philip, upon, his, mother, s, death, a, year, earlier, passed, to, the, next, heir, jean, de, boulogne, the, brother, of, philip, s, grandfather, william, xii, of, auvergne, the, counties, of, burgundy, and, artois, passed, to, the, sister, of, philip, s, grandmother, countess, joan, margaret, of, france, herself, the, grandmother, of, philip, s, young, bride, margaret, of, dampierre, the, duchy, of, burgundy, however, proved, a, greater, challenge, to, jurists, in, the, duchy, as, in, much, of, europe, at, this, time, two, principles, of, inheritance, were, held, valid, that, of, primogeniture, and, that, of, proximity, of, blood, a, case, of, primogeniture, was, the, succession, of, the, english, crown, in, 1377, which, at, the, death, of, edward, iii, was, inherited, by, his, grandson, richard, the, eldest, son, of, his, deceased, eldest, son, edward, rather, than, by, his, son, john, of, gaunt, the, eldest, of, edward, iii, s, sons, still, living, a, case, of, proximity, of, blood, was, that, of, artois, in, 1302, which, had, on, the, death, of, count, robert, ii, been, inherited, by, mahaut, his, eldest, living, daughter, rather, than, by, his, grandson, robert, the, eldest, son, of, the, count, s, already, deceased, son, in, some, cases, the, two, principles, were, able, to, mesh, together, in, the, case, of, boulogne, and, auvergne, for, example, john, was, the, second, son, of, robert, of, auvergne, philip, s, great, grandfather, and, the, nearest, ancestor, to, philip, to, have, surviving, lines, of, descent, following, philip, s, death, john, was, therefore, both, the, most, senior, heir, to, robert, following, philip, s, death, and, also, the, closest, to, robert, by, descent, in, the, same, manner, margaret, of, france, was, the, closest, heir, by, both, primogeniture, and, proximity, to, her, mother, joan, of, ch, lons, countess, of, burgundy, and, artois, philip, s, great, grandmother, and, again, the, nearest, ancestor, of, philip, to, have, lines, of, descent, surviving, the, duke, s, death, the, situation, for, the, duchy, of, burgundy, however, was, not, so, simple, in, terms, of, inheritance, the, nearest, ancestor, to, philip, of, rouvres, to, have, lines, of, descent, surviving, philip, s, death, was, his, great, grandfather, duke, robert, ii, the, father, of, odo, iv, unlike, joan, of, ch, lons, and, robert, of, auvergne, however, both, of, whom, had, left, only, two, lines, of, descent, allowing, the, cadet, line, to, inherit, without, controversy, following, the, termination, of, the, main, branch, with, philip, robert, ii, had, left, three, lines, of, descent, the, main, line, through, odo, iv, which, had, ended, with, philip, and, two, cadet, lines, through, his, daughters, margaret, and, joan, both, women, were, long, dead, margaret, of, burgundy, the, elder, daughter, and, the, wife, of, louis, x, of, france, had, died, in, 1315, leaving, only, a, daughter, joan, ii, of, navarre, joan, of, burgundy, the, younger, daughter, and, the, wife, of, philip, vi, of, france, had, died, in, 1348, leaving, two, sons, john, ii, of, france, and, philip, of, orl, ans, out, of, these, three, joan, of, burgundy, s, sons, were, still, alive, joan, ii, however, had, died, in, 1349, leaving, three, sons, the, eldest, of, whom, was, charles, ii, of, navarre, to, the, jurists, of, the, duchy, these, facts, presented, something, of, a, difficult, legal, problem, for, the, two, claims, stood, more, or, less, equally, in, terms, of, justification, charles, ii, as, the, great, grandson, of, robert, ii, by, his, elder, daughter, had, a, superior, claim, to, john, ii, in, terms, of, primogeniture, john, ii, as, the, grandson, of, robert, ii, by, his, younger, daughter, had, a, superior, claim, to, charles, ii, in, terms, of, proximity, of, blood, were, it, simply, a, legal, issue, the, king, of, navarre, would, certainly, have, had, as, good, a, chance, of, inheritance, as, the, king, of, france, and, perhaps, better, proximity, of, blood, was, beginning, to, lose, force, in, europe, and, as, events, would, subsequently, prove, burgundy, had, no, intention, of, being, absorbed, into, the, french, royal, domain, but, there, was, more, in, play, than, a, simple, legal, issue, the, hundred, years, war, was, in, full, flow, and, the, king, of, navarre, as, an, ally, of, england, and, an, enemy, of, france, was, distasteful, to, the, burgundians, who, in, meetings, of, the, estates, during, john, ii, s, english, captivity, had, been, consistently, loyal, to, john, and, his, son, the, dauphin, and, opposed, to, the, king, of, navarre, furthermore, john, ii, had, the, support, of, john, of, boulogne, and, margaret, of, france, the, former, was, a, staunch, ally, of, the, king, an, alliance, strengthened, by, the, marriage, between, the, king, and, joan, of, boulogne, john, of, boulogne, s, niece, as, the, daughter, of, a, former, king, of, france, and, one, of, the, last, living, members, of, the, senior, branch, of, the, house, of, capet, the, latter, was, staunchly, french, in, her, sympathies, besides, which, charles, ii, had, offended, her, by, laying, claim, to, lands, in, champagne, that, had, formed, part, of, her, sister, joan, of, france, s, dowry, in, marrying, odo, iv, and, which, were, deemed, now, to, pass, to, joan, s, sister, these, lands, had, derived, from, joan, i, of, navarre, countess, of, champagne, grandmother, of, margaret, and, joan, and, as, the, senior, heir, by, primogeniture, of, joan, i, charles, was, now, laying, claim, to, them, with, this, triple, compact, between, the, three, heirs, charles, ii, was, shut, out, the, support, of, a, co, heir, carried, weight, in, deciding, inheritance, and, john, ii, had, the, support, of, both, while, charles, ii, had, the, support, of, neither, the, nobility, of, the, duchy, in, the, face, of, this, decided, in, favour, of, john, ii, who, took, immediate, possession, he, had, already, mobilised, soldiers, in, nivernais, to, do, so, by, force, if, it, proved, necessary, but, in, fact, the, nobility, willingly, swore, homage, to, him, as, their, new, duke, and, the, duchy, saw, only, a, few, isolated, and, half, hearted, acts, of, rebellion, in, favour, of, charles, ii, the, legal, implications, of, the, accession, of, john, the, good, are, frequently, misunderstood, it, is, not, uncommon, to, read, that, upon, the, death, of, philip, of, rouvres, the, duchy, of, burgundy, lying, within, france, therefore, escheated, to, the, french, crown, this, claim, is, simply, untrue, the, duchy, had, been, granted, to, the, heirs, of, robert, i, and, were, it, not, for, the, manner, in, which, the, descendants, of, duke, robert, ii, married, and, the, circumstances, under, which, philip, of, rouvres, died, john, ii, who, made, his, claim, to, the, duchy, as, the, son, of, joan, of, burgundy, and, the, grandson, of, robert, ii, rather, than, as, the, feudal, overlord, of, all, france, would, never, have, inherited, it, the, claim, however, that, upon, his, inheritance, of, the, duchy, it, was, merged, with, the, crown, is, more, difficult, to, refute, for, while, this, in, itself, certainly, was, not, the, case, he, immediately, attempted, to, merge, the, duchy, into, the, crown, by, means, of, letters, patent, he, proclaimed, in, the, relevant, document, that, he, was, taking, possession, by, virtue, of, his, descent, from, the, dukes, and, continued, that, as, the, duke, he, immediately, gave, the, duchy, to, the, french, crown, with, which, it, was, to, be, inseparably, united, much, the, same, as, would, be, followed, in, the, case, of, brittany, in, 1532, had, this, come, into, effect, burgundy, as, an, independent, duchy, would, have, ceased, to, exist, and, john, would, no, longer, have, been, the, duke, as, a, result, a, definitive, break, in, the, duchy, s, history, would, have, occurred, john, however, failed, to, grasp, the, realities, of, the, political, situation, within, the, duchy, he, had, already, been, smoothly, accepted, as, duke, on, 28, december, 1361, he, received, the, homage, of, the, burgundian, nobility, before, he, returned, to, france, leaving, the, count, of, tancarville, as, his, deputy, but, the, burgundian, estates, had, in, their, meeting, around, the, time, of, the, homage, swearing, of, 28, december, firmly, given, several, pronouncements, they, declared, that, the, duchy, intended, to, remain, a, duchy, that, it, had, no, intention, of, becoming, a, province, of, the, royal, domain, that, there, would, be, no, administrative, changes, and, that, it, was, joined, to, france, by, virtue, of, one, man, s, rights, and, would, never, be, absorbed, into, it, most, importantly, it, was, firmly, stated, that, there, had, not, been, and, never, would, be, an, annexation, of, burgundy, by, france, merely, juxtaposition, the, king, was, also, the, duke, but, there, would, be, no, deeper, link, than, that, set, against, these, declarations, of, burgundian, autonomy, was, the, decree, of, john, ii, that, burgundy, was, absorbed, into, the, french, crown, the, latter, proved, to, no, avail, the, burgundians, refused, to, countenance, the, terms, of, the, letters, patent, the, king, proved, unequal, to, the, task, of, enforcing, his, policy, which, was, far, beyond, his, political, capabilities, in, the, face, of, a, non, violent, but, firm, refusal, by, the, burgundians, to, allow, the, independence, of, their, duchy, to, be, threatened, the, king, quietly, scrapped, the, letters, patent, and, instead, turned, to, other, means, the, king, s, youngest, son, philip, the, bold, was, also, his, favourite, most, renowned, philip, had, distinguished, himself, in, 1356, at, the, battle, of, poitiers, when, at, the, age, of, fourteen, he, bravely, fought, alongside, his, father, to, the, bitter, end, it, occurred, to, him, to, both, honour, his, son, and, soothe, the, ruffled, feelings, of, the, burgundians, by, investing, him, as, duke, of, burgundy, accordingly, the, king, appointed, philip, governor, of, burgundy, in, late, june, 1363, following, which, the, estates, of, burgundy, who, had, consistently, opposed, the, previous, governor, tancarville, loyally, granted, him, subsidies, finally, in, the, final, months, of, john, the, good, s, reign, philip, the, bold, was, established, as, duke, of, burgundy, the, king, secretly, created, him, duke, on, 6, september, 1363, in, his, dual, role, as, duke, giving, his, own, title, to, his, child, and, as, king, sanctioning, this, change, in, leadership, and, on, 2, june, 1364, following, the, death, of, king, john, king, charles, v, issued, a, letters, patent, to, publicly, establish, the, fact, of, philip, s, title, under, the, valois, dukes, of, burgundy, the, duchy, flourished, a, match, between, philip, the, bold, and, margaret, of, dampierre, the, widow, of, philip, of, rouvres, not, only, reunited, the, duchy, with, the, county, of, burgundy, once, more, as, well, as, with, the, county, of, artois, but, also, served, to, bring, the, wealthy, counties, of, flanders, nevers, and, rethel, under, the, control, of, the, dukes, by, 1405, following, the, deaths, of, philip, and, margaret, and, the, inheritance, of, the, duchy, and, most, of, their, other, possessions, by, their, son, john, the, fearless, burgundy, stood, less, as, a, french, fief, and, more, as, an, independent, state, as, such, it, was, a, major, political, player, in, european, politics, the, burgundian, state, was, reckoned, to, include, not, only, the, original, territories, of, the, duchy, of, burgundy, in, what, is, now, eastern, france, but, also, the, northern, territories, that, came, to, the, dukes, through, the, marriage, of, philip, and, margaret, philip, the, bold, had, been, a, cautious, man, in, politics, his, son, john, the, fearless, r, 1404, 1419, however, was, not, and, under, him, burgundy, and, orl, ans, clashed, as, the, two, sides, squabbled, for, power, the, result, was, an, increase, of, burgundy, s, power, but, the, burgundian, state, came, to, be, regarded, as, an, enemy, of, the, french, crown, from, john, s, death, the, dukes, were, treated, with, caution, or, outright, hostility, by, charles, vii, and, his, successor, louis, xi, the, last, two, dukes, to, directly, rule, the, duchy, philip, the, good, r, 1419, 1467, and, charles, the, bold, r, 1467, 1477, attempted, to, secure, the, independence, of, their, state, from, the, french, crown, the, endeavour, failed, when, charles, the, bold, died, in, battle, leaving, no, sons, louis, xi, of, france, declared, the, duchy, escheated, and, absorbed, the, territory, into, the, french, crown, charles, s, daughter, mary, inherited, the, rest, of, his, domain, and, claimed, the, duchy, of, burgundy, her, heirs, called, themselves, dukes, of, burgundy, refusing, to, accept, the, loss, of, the, duchy, the, war, of, the, burgundian, succession, took, place, from, 1477, to, 1482, eventually, king, louis, xi, of, france, and, archduke, maximilian, of, austria, mary, s, widower, signed, the, treaty, of, arras, 1482, maximilian, recognised, the, annexation, of, the, duchy, and, county, of, burgundy, and, several, other, territories, france, thus, retained, most, of, its, burgundian, fiefdoms, except, for, the, affluent, county, of, flanders, which, passed, to, maximilian, and, mary, s, descendants, but, soon, rebelled, with, the, 1493, treaty, of, senlis, maximilian, regained, for, his, and, mary, s, descendants, the, county, of, burgundy, artois, and, charolais, but, the, duchy, of, burgundy, and, picardy, were, lost, definitively, to, france, in, 1526, mary, s, grandson, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, was, restored, to, the, title, and, territory, by, the, french, king, francis, i, under, duress, as, part, of, the, treaty, of, madrid, but, francis, i, repudiated, the, treaty, as, soon, as, he, was, able, and, charles, v, never, managed, to, secure, control, of, the, duchy, further, with, the, abdication, of, charles, v, as, holy, roman, emperor, henry, ii, of, france, argued, that, since, the, main, family, line, of, the, house, of, habsburg, had, ceased, ruling, the, holy, roman, empire, or, austria, the, claim, of, the, title, by, the, spanish, habsburgs, was, null, and, void, the, territory, of, burgundy, remained, part, of, france, from, then, onwards, the, title, was, occasionally, resurrected, for, french, princes, for, example, the, grandson, of, louis, xiv, louis, duke, of, burgundy, and, the, grandson, of, louis, xv, the, short, lived, louis,
