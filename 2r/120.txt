the, parthian, empire, p, r, i, n, also, known, as, the, arsacid, empire, r, s, s, d, was, a, major, iranian, political, and, cultural, power, centered, in, ancient, iran, from, 247, bc, to, 224, ad, its, latter, name, comes, from, its, founder, arsaces, i, who, led, the, parni, tribe, in, conquering, the, region, of, parthia, in, iran, s, northeast, then, a, satrapy, province, under, andragoras, who, was, rebelling, against, the, seleucid, empire, mithridates, i, r, c, 171, 132, bc, greatly, expanded, the, empire, by, seizing, media, and, mesopotamia, from, the, seleucids, at, its, height, the, parthian, empire, stretched, from, the, northern, reaches, of, the, euphrates, in, what, is, now, central, eastern, turkey, to, present, day, afghanistan, and, western, pakistan, the, empire, located, on, the, silk, road, trade, route, between, the, roman, empire, in, the, mediterranean, basin, and, the, han, dynasty, of, china, became, a, center, of, trade, and, commerce, the, parthians, largely, adopted, the, art, architecture, religious, beliefs, and, royal, insignia, of, their, culturally, heterogeneous, empire, which, encompassed, persian, hellenistic, and, regional, cultures, for, about, the, first, half, of, its, existence, the, arsacid, court, adopted, elements, of, greek, culture, though, it, eventually, saw, a, gradual, revival, of, iranian, traditions, the, arsacid, rulers, were, titled, the, king, of, kings, as, a, claim, to, be, the, heirs, to, the, achaemenid, empire, indeed, they, accepted, many, local, kings, as, vassals, where, the, achaemenids, would, have, had, centrally, appointed, albeit, largely, autonomous, satraps, the, court, did, appoint, a, small, number, of, satraps, largely, outside, iran, but, these, satrapies, were, smaller, and, less, powerful, than, the, achaemenid, potentates, with, the, expansion, of, arsacid, power, the, seat, of, central, government, shifted, from, nisa, to, ctesiphon, along, the, tigris, south, of, baghdad, although, several, other, sites, also, served, as, capitals, the, earliest, enemies, of, the, parthians, were, the, seleucids, in, the, west, and, the, scythians, in, the, north, however, as, parthia, expanded, westward, they, came, into, conflict, with, the, kingdom, of, armenia, and, eventually, the, late, roman, republic, rome, and, parthia, competed, with, each, other, to, establish, the, kings, of, armenia, as, their, subordinate, clients, the, parthians, destroyed, the, army, of, marcus, licinius, crassus, at, the, battle, of, carrhae, in, 53, bc, and, in, 40, 39, bc, parthian, forces, captured, the, whole, of, the, levant, except, tyre, from, the, romans, mark, antony, led, a, roman, counterattack, several, roman, emperors, invaded, mesopotamia, in, the, roman, parthian, wars, of, the, next, few, centuries, capturing, the, cities, of, seleucia, and, ctesiphon, frequent, civil, wars, between, parthian, contenders, to, the, throne, proved, more, dangerous, to, the, empire, s, stability, than, foreign, invasion, and, parthian, power, evaporated, when, ardashir, i, ruler, of, istakhr, in, persis, revolted, against, the, arsacids, and, killed, their, last, ruler, artabanus, iv, in, 224, ad, ardashir, established, the, sasanian, empire, which, ruled, iran, and, much, of, the, near, east, until, the, muslim, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, ad, although, the, arsacid, dynasty, lived, on, through, branches, of, the, family, that, ruled, armenia, iberia, and, albania, in, the, caucasus, native, parthian, sources, written, in, parthian, greek, and, other, languages, are, scarce, when, compared, to, sasanian, and, even, earlier, achaemenid, sources, aside, from, scattered, cuneiform, tablets, fragmentary, ostraca, rock, inscriptions, drachma, coins, and, the, chance, survival, of, some, parchment, documents, much, of, parthian, history, is, only, known, through, external, sources, these, include, mainly, greek, and, roman, histories, but, also, chinese, histories, prompted, by, the, han, chinese, desire, to, form, alliances, against, the, xiongnu, parthian, artwork, is, viewed, by, some, historians, as, a, valid, source, for, understanding, aspects, of, society, and, culture, that, are, otherwise, absent, in, textual, sources, before, arsaces, i, founded, the, arsacid, dynasty, he, was, chieftain, of, the, parni, an, ancient, central, asian, tribe, of, iranian, peoples, and, one, of, several, nomadic, tribes, within, the, confederation, of, the, dahae, the, parni, most, likely, spoke, an, eastern, iranian, language, in, contrast, to, the, northwestern, iranian, language, spoken, at, the, time, in, parthia, the, latter, was, a, northeastern, province, first, under, the, achaemenid, empire, and, then, the, seleucid, empire, after, conquering, the, region, the, parni, adopted, parthian, as, the, official, court, language, speaking, it, alongside, middle, persian, aramaic, greek, babylonian, sogdian, and, other, languages, in, the, multilingual, territories, they, would, conquer, why, the, arsacid, court, retroactively, chose, 247, bc, as, the, first, year, of, the, arsacid, era, is, uncertain, a, d, h, bivar, concludes, that, this, was, the, year, the, seleucids, lost, control, of, parthia, to, andragoras, the, appointed, satrap, who, rebelled, against, them, hence, arsaces, i, backdated, his, regnal, years, to, the, moment, when, seleucid, control, over, parthia, ceased, however, vesta, sarkhosh, curtis, asserts, that, this, was, simply, the, year, arsaces, was, made, chief, of, the, parni, tribe, homa, katouzian, and, gene, ralph, garthwaite, claim, it, was, the, year, arsaces, conquered, parthia, and, expelled, the, seleucid, authorities, yet, curtis, and, maria, brosius, state, that, andragoras, was, not, overthrown, by, the, arsacids, until, 238, bc, it, is, unclear, who, immediately, succeeded, arsaces, i, bivar, and, katouzian, affirm, that, it, was, his, brother, tiridates, i, of, parthia, who, in, turn, was, succeeded, by, his, son, arsaces, ii, of, parthia, in, 211, bc, yet, curtis, and, brosius, state, that, arsaces, ii, was, the, immediate, successor, of, arsaces, i, with, curtis, claiming, the, succession, took, place, in, 211, bc, and, brosius, in, 217, bc, bivar, insists, that, 138, bc, the, last, regnal, year, of, mithridates, i, is, the, first, precisely, established, regnal, date, of, parthian, history, due, to, these, and, other, discrepancies, bivar, outlines, two, distinct, royal, chronologies, accepted, by, historians, a, fictitious, claim, was, later, made, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, onwards, by, the, parthians, which, represented, them, as, descendants, of, the, achaemenid, king, of, kings, artaxerxes, ii, of, persia, r, 404, 358, bc, for, a, time, arsaces, i, consolidated, his, position, in, parthia, and, hyrcania, by, taking, advantage, of, the, invasion, of, seleucid, territory, in, the, west, by, ptolemy, iii, euergetes, r, 246, 222, bc, of, egypt, this, conflict, with, ptolemy, the, third, syrian, war, 246, 241, bc, also, allowed, diodotus, i, to, rebel, and, form, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, in, central, asia, the, latter, s, successor, diodotus, ii, formed, an, alliance, with, arsaces, i, against, the, seleucids, but, arsaces, was, temporarily, driven, from, parthia, by, the, forces, of, seleucus, ii, callinicus, r, 246, 225, bc, after, spending, some, time, in, exile, among, the, nomadic, apasiacae, tribe, arsaces, i, led, a, counterattack, and, recaptured, parthia, seleucus, ii, s, successor, antiochus, iii, the, great, r, 222, 187, bc, was, unable, to, immediately, retaliate, because, his, troops, were, engaged, in, putting, down, the, rebellion, of, molon, in, media, antiochus, iii, launched, a, massive, campaign, to, retake, parthia, and, bactria, in, 210, or, 209, bc, despite, some, victories, he, was, unsuccessful, but, did, negotiate, a, peace, settlement, with, arsaces, ii, the, latter, was, granted, the, title, of, king, greek, basileus, in, return, for, his, submission, to, antiochus, iii, as, his, superior, the, seleucids, were, unable, to, further, intervene, in, parthian, affairs, following, increasing, encroachment, by, the, roman, republic, and, the, seleucid, defeat, at, magnesia, in, 190, bc, priapatius, r, c, 191, 176, bc, succeeded, arsaces, ii, and, phraates, i, r, c, 176, 171, bc, eventually, ascended, the, parthian, throne, phraates, i, ruled, parthia, without, further, seleucid, interference, phraates, i, is, recorded, as, expanding, parthia, s, control, past, the, gates, of, alexander, and, occupied, apamea, ragiana, the, locations, of, these, are, unknown, yet, the, greatest, expansion, of, parthian, power, and, territory, took, place, during, the, reign, of, his, brother, and, successor, mithridates, i, r, c, 171, 132, bc, whom, katouzian, compares, to, cyrus, the, great, d, 530, bc, founder, of, the, achaemenid, empire, relations, between, parthia, and, greco, bactria, deteriorated, after, the, death, of, diodotus, ii, when, forces, under, mithridates, i, captured, two, eparchies, of, the, latter, kingdom, then, under, eucratides, i, r, c, 170, 145, bc, turning, his, sights, on, the, seleucid, realm, mithridates, i, invaded, media, and, occupied, ecbatana, in, 148, or, 147, bc, the, region, had, been, destabilized, by, a, recent, seleucid, suppression, of, a, rebellion, there, led, by, timarchus, this, victory, was, followed, by, the, parthian, conquest, of, babylonia, in, mesopotamia, where, mithridates, i, had, coins, minted, at, seleucia, in, 141, bc, and, held, an, official, investiture, ceremony, while, mithridates, i, retired, to, hyrcania, his, forces, subdued, the, kingdoms, of, elymais, and, characene, and, occupied, susa, by, this, time, parthian, authority, extended, as, far, east, as, the, indus, river, whereas, hecatompylos, had, served, as, the, first, parthian, capital, mithridates,

visited, the, court, of, vardanes, i, r, c, 40, 47, ad, in, 42, ad, vardanes, provided, him, with, the, protection, of, a, caravan, as, he, traveled, to, indo, parthia, when, apollonius, reached, indo, parthia, s, capital, taxila, his, caravan, leader, read, vardanes, official, letter, perhaps, written, in, parthian, to, an, indian, official, who, treated, apollonius, with, great, hospitality, following, the, diplomatic, venture, of, zhang, qian, into, central, asia, during, the, reign, of, emperor, wu, of, han, r, 141, 87, bc, the, han, empire, of, china, sent, a, delegation, to,

pearls, were, also, a, highly, valued, import, from, china, while, the, chinese, purchased, parthian, spices, perfumes, and, fruits, exotic, animals, were, also, given, as, gifts, from, the, arsacid, to, han, courts, in, 87, ad, pacorus, ii, of, parthia, sent, lions, and, persian, gazelles, to, emperor, zhang, of, han, r, 75, 88, ad, besides, silk, parthian, goods, purchased, by, roman, merchants,

northern, india, largely, guaranteed, the, security, of, parthia, s, eastern, border, thus, from, the, mid, 1st, century, bc, onwards, the, arsacid, court, focused, on, securing, the, western, border, primarily, against, rome, a, year, following, mithridates, ii, s, subjugation, of, armenia, lucius, cornelius, sulla, the, roman, proconsul, of, cilicia, convened, with, the, parthian, diplomat, orobazus, at, the, euphrates, river, the, two, agreed, that, the, river, would, serve, as, the, border, between, parthia, and, rome, although, several, historians, have, argued, that, sulla, only,

coined, in, scholarship, as, the, parthian, dark, age, due, to, the, lack, of, clear, information, on, the, events, of, this, period, in, the, empire, except, a, series, of, apparently, overlapping, reigns, it, is, only, with, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, orodes, ii, in, c, 57, bc, that, the, line, of, parthian, rulers, can, again, be, reliably, traced, this, system, of, split, monarchy,

by, roman, historians, whereas, augustus, and, nero, had, chosen, a, cautious, military, policy, when, confronting, parthia, later, roman, emperors, invaded, and, attempted, to, conquer, the, eastern, fertile, crescent, the, heart, of, the, parthian, empire, along, the, tigris, and, euphrates, the, heightened, aggression, can, be, explained, in, part, by, rome, s, military, reforms, to, match, parthia, s, strength, in, missile, troops, and, mounted, warriors, the, romans, at, first, used, foreign, allies, especially, nabataeans, but, later, established, a, permanent, auxilia, force, to, complement, their, heavy, legionary, infantry, the, romans, eventually, maintained, regiments, of, horse, archers, sagittarii, and, even, mail, armored, cataphracts, in, their, eastern, provinces, yet, the, romans, had, no, discernible, grand, strategy, in, dealing, with, parthia, and, gained, very, little, territory, from, these, invasions, the, primary, motivations, for, war, were, the, advancement, of, the, personal, glory, and, political, position, of, the, emperor, as, well, as, defending, roman, honor, against, perceived, slights, such, as, parthian, interference, in, the, affairs, of, rome, s, client, states, hostilities, between, rome, and, parthia, were, renewed, when, osroes, i, of, parthia, r, c, 109, 128, ad, deposed, the, armenian, king, sanatruk, and, replaced,

was, in, his, intentions, temporary, because, he, wanted, to, renew, the, attack, on, parthia, in, 118, ad, and, make, the, subjection, of, the, parthians, a, reality, but, trajan, died, suddenly, in, august, 117, ad, during, his, campaign, trajan, was, granted, the, title, parthicus, by, the, senate, and, coins, were, minted, proclaiming, the, conquest, of, parthia, however, only, the, 4th,

mesopotamia, by, avidius, cassius, in, 164, ad, the, romans, captured, and, burnt, seleucia, and, ctesiphon, to, the, ground, yet, they, were, forced, to, retreat, once, the, roman, soldiers, contracted, a, deadly, disease, possibly, smallpox, that, soon, ravaged, the, roman, world, although, they, withdrew, from, this, point, forward, the, city, of, dura, europos, remained, in, roman, hands, when, roman, emperor, septimius, severus, r, 193, 211, ad, invaded, mesopotamia, in, 197, ad, during, the, reign, of, vologases, v, of, parthia, r, c, 191, 208, ad, the, romans, once, again,

provinces, once, more, he, marched, into, mesopotamia, under, the, pretext, of, marrying, one, of, artabanus, daughters, but, the, marriage, was, not, allowed, consequently, caracalla, made, war, on, parthia, conquering, arbil, and, sacking, the, parthian, tombs, there, caracalla, was, assassinated, the, next, year, on, the, road, to, carrhae, by, his, soldiers, at, the, battle, of, nisibis, the, parthians, were, able, to, defeat, the, romans, but, both, sides, suffered, heavy, losses, after, this, debacle, the, parthians, made, a, settlement, with, macrinus, r, 217, 218, where, the, romans, paid, parthia, over, two, hundred, million, denarii, with, additional, gifts, the, parthian, empire, weakened, by, internal, strife, and, wars, with, rome, was, soon, to, be, followed, by, the, sasanian, empire, indeed, shortly, afterward, ardashir, i, the, local, iranian, ruler, of, persis, modern, fars, province, iran, from, istakhr, began, subjugating, the, surrounding, territories, in, defiance, of, arsacid, rule, he, confronted, artabanus, iv, at, the, battle, of, hormozdg, n, on, 28, april, 224, ad, perhaps, at, a, site, near, isfahan, defeating, him, and, establishing, the, sasanian, empire, there, is, evidence, however, that, suggests, vologases, vi, continued, to, mint, coins, at, seleucia, as, late, as, 228, ad, the, sassanians, would, not, only, assume, parthia, s, legacy, as, rome, s, persian, nemesis, but, they, would, also, attempt, to, restore, the, boundaries, of, the, achaemenid, empire, by, briefly, conquering, the, levant, anatolia, and, egypt, from,

remain, scarce, with, fewer, of, them, available, than, for, any, other, period, of, iranian, history, most, contemporary, written, records, on, parthia, contain, greek, as, well, as, parthian, and, aramaic, inscriptions, the, parthian, language, was, written, in, a, distinct, script, derived, from, the, imperial, aramaic, chancellery, script, of, the, achaemenids, and, later, developed, into, the, pahlavi, writing, system, the, most, valuable, indigenous, sources, for, reconstructing, an, accurate, chronology, of, arsacid, rulers, are, the, metal, drachma, coins, issued, by, each, ruler, these, represent, a, transition, from, non, textual, to, textual, remains, according, to, historian, geo, widengren, other, parthian, sources, used, for, reconstructing, chronology, include, cuneiform, astronomical, tablets, and, colophons, discovered, in, babylonia, indigenous, textual, sources, also, include, stone, inscriptions, parchment, and, papyri, documents, and, pottery, ostraca,

of, items, like, wine, along, with, parchment, documents, found, at, sites, like, dura, europos, these, also, provide, valuable, information, on, parthian, governmental, administration, covering, issues, such, as, taxation, military, titles, and, provincial, organization, the, greek, and, latin, histories, which, represent, the, majority, of, materials, covering, parthian, history, are, not, considered, entirely, reliable, since, they, were, written, from, the, perspective, of, rivals, and, wartime, enemies, these, external, sources, generally, concern, major, military, and, political,

of, parthia, and, valuable, political, and, geographical, information, for, example, the, shiji, ch, 123, describes, diplomatic, exchanges, exotic, gifts, given, by, mithridates, ii, to, the, han, court, types, of, agricultural, crops, grown, in, parthia, production, of, wine, using, grapes, itinerant, merchants, and, the, size, and, location, of, parthian, territory, the, shiji, also, mentions, that, the, parthians, kept, records, by, writing, horizontally, on, strips, of, leather, that, is, parchment, in, islamic, sources, the, parthian, dynasty, is, mentioned, with, three, dynastic, branch, names, a, k, ni, n, a, ni, n, and, afqur, h, n, the, obvious, differences, between, the, names, of, parthian, dynastic, branches, in, islamic, sources, has, been, forgotten, by, modern, persian, speaking, historians, intentionally, or, unintentionally, because, the, translators, and, correctors, of, arabic, to, persian, sources, changed, the, letter, to, k, in, all, historical, texts, and, also, changed, the, word, of, persia, to, iran, the, true, intention, of, the, islamic, historical, sources, have, been, forgotten, as, the, consequence, these, different, dynastic, branches, have, become, a, single, dynasty, in, the, form, of, the, name, a, k, ni, n, in, the, new, editions, of, islamic, sources, it, is, known, however, that, the, arsacid, royal, family, line, survived, within, three, ruling, dynasties, belonging, to, armenia, caucasian, iberia, and, aghbania, in, the, caucasus, compared, with, the, earlier, achaemenid, empire, the, parthian, government, was, notably, decentralized, an, indigenous, historical, source, reveals, that, territories, overseen, by, the, central, government, were, organized, in, a, similar, manner, to, the, seleucid, empire, they, both, had, a, threefold, division, for, their, provincial, hierarchies, the, parthian, marzb, n, x, atrap, and, dizpat, similar, to, the, seleucid, satrapy, eparchy, and, hyparchy, the, parthian, empire, also, contained, several, subordinate, semi, autonomous, kingdoms, including, the, states, of, caucasian, iberia, armenia, atropatene, gordyene, adiabene, edessa, hatra, mesene, elymais, and, persis, the, state, rulers, governed, their, own, territories, and, minted, their, own, coinage, distinct, from, the, royal, coinage, produced, at, the, imperial, mints, this, was, not, unlike, the, earlier, achaemenid, empire, which, also, had, some, city, states, and, even, distant, satrapies, who, were, semi, independent, but, recognised, the, supremacy, of, the, king, paid, tribute, and, provided, military, support, according, to, brosius, however, the, satraps, of, parthian, times, governed, smaller, territories, and, perhaps, had, less, prestige, and, influence, than, their, achaemenid, predecessors, during, the, seleucid, period, the, trend, of, local, ruling, dynasties, with, semi, autonomous, rule, and, sometimes, outright, rebellious, rule, became, commonplace, a, fact, reflected, in, the, later, parthian, style, of, governance, the, king, of, kings, headed, the, parthian, government, he, maintained, polygamous, relations, and, was, usually, succeeded, by, his, first, born, son, like, the, ptolemies, of, egypt, there, is, also, record, of, arsacid, kings, marrying, their, nieces, and, perhaps, even, half, sisters, queen, musa, is, said, by, josephus, to, have, married, her, own, son, though, this, would, be, an, extreme, and, isolated, case, brosius, provides, an, extract, from, a, letter, written, in, greek, by, king, artabanus, ii, in, 21, ad, which, addresses, the, governor, titled, archon, and, citizens, of, the, city, of, susa, specific, government, offices, of, preferred, friend, bodyguard, and, treasurer, are, mentioned, and, the, document, also, proves, that, while, there, were, local, jurisdictions, and, proceedings, to, appointment, to, high, office, the, king, could, intervene, on, behalf, of, an, individual, review, a, case, and, amend, the, local, ruling, if, he, considered, it, appropriate, the, hereditary, titles, of, the, hierarchic, nobility, recorded, during, the, reign, of, the, first, sasanian, monarch, ardashir, i, most, likely, reflect, the, titles, already, in, use, during, the, parthian, era, there, were, three, distinct, tiers, of, nobility, the, highest, being, the, regional, kings, directly, below, the, king, of, kings, the, second, being, those, related, to, the, king, of, kings, only, through, marriage, and, the, lowest, order, being, heads, of, local, clans, and, small, territories, by, the, 1st, century, ad, the, parthian, nobility, had, assumed, great, power, and, influence, in, the, succession, and, deposition, of, arsacid, kings, some, of, the, nobility, functioned, as, court, advisers, to, the, king, as, well, as, holy, priests, strabo, in, his, geographica, preserved, a, claim, by, the, greek, philosopher, and, historian, poseidonius, that, the, council, of, parthia, consisted, of, noble, kinsmen, and, magi, two, groups, from, which, the, kings, were, appointed, of, the, great, noble, parthian, families, listed, at, the, beginning, of, the, sassanian, period, only, two, are, explicitly, mentioned, in, earlier, parthian, documents, the, house, of, suren, and, the, house, of, karen, the, historian, plutarch, noted, that, members, of, the, suren, family, the, first, among, the, nobility, were, given, the, privilege, of, crowning, each, new, arsacid, king, of, kings, during, their, coronations, the, parthian, empire, had, no, standing, army, yet, were, able, to, quickly, recruit, troops, in, the, event, of, local, crises, there, was, a, permanent, armed, guard, attached, to, the, person, of, the, king, comprising, nobles, serfs, and, mercenaries, but, this, royal, retinue, was, small, garrisons, were, also, permanently, maintained, at, border, forts, parthian, inscriptions, reveal, some, of, the, military, titles, granted, to, the, commanders, of, these, locations, military, forces, could, also, be, used, in, diplomatic, gestures, for, example, when, chinese, envoys, visited, parthia, in, the, late, 2nd, century, bc, the, shiji, maintains, that, 20, 000, horsemen, were, sent, to, the, eastern, borders, to, serve, as, escorts, for, the, embassy, although, this, figure, is, perhaps, an, exaggeration, the, main, striking, force, of, the, parthian, army, was, its, cataphracts, heavy, cavalry, with, man, and, horse, decked, in, mailed, armor, the, cataphracts, were, equipped, with, a, lance, for, charging, into, enemy, lines, but, were, not, equipped, with, bows, and, arrows, which, were, restricted, to, horse, archers, due, to, the, cost, of, their, equipment, and, armor, cataphracts, were, recruited, from, among, the, aristocratic, class, who, in, return, for, their, services, demanded, a, measure, of, autonomy, at, the, local, level, from, the, arsacid, kings, the, light, cavalry, was, recruited, from, among, the, commoner, class, and, acted, as, horse, archers, they, wore, a, simple, tunic, and, trousers, into, battle, they, used, composite, bows, and, were, able, to, shoot, at, enemies, while, riding, and, facing, away, from, them, this, technique, known, as, the, parthian, shot, was, a, highly, effective, tactic, it, appears, that, most, of, the, parthian, army, was, cavalry, for, tactical, and, strategic, reasons, the, light, cavalry, is, thought, to, have, carried, a, sword, into, battle, as, well, while, cataphracts, likely, were, also, armed, with, short, swords, or, knives, the, parthians, also, made, use, of, the, camel, in, armed, combat, the, heavy, and, light, cavalry, of, parthia, proved, to, be, a, decisive, factor, in, the, battle, of, carrhae, where, a, parthian, force, defeated, a, much, larger, roman, army, under, crassus, light, infantry, units, composed, of, levied, commoners, and, mercenaries, were, used, to, disperse, enemy, troops, after, cavalry, charges, the, parthians, do, not, appear, to, have, ever, used, war, chariots, in, battle, however, royal, parthian, women, accompanied, the, king, on, military, campaigns, and, were, known, to, have, ridden, on, chariots, and, wagons, similarly, the, parthians, appeared, to, have, used, war, elephants, infrequently, there, is, one, mention, by, tacitus, and, cassius, dio, of, the, use, of, one, war, elephant, by, vologases, i, during, the, roman, parthian, war, of, 58, 63, the, size, of, the, parthian, army, is, unknown, as, is, the, size, of, the, empire, s, overall, population, however, archaeological, excavations, in, former, parthian, urban, centers, reveal, settlements, which, could, have, sustained, large, populations, and, hence, a, great, resource, in, manpower, dense, population, centers, in, regions, like, babylonia, were, no, doubt, attractive, to, the, romans, whose, armies, could, afford, to, live, off, the, land, the, largest, army, raised, by, the, parthians, appears, to, have, been, 50, 000, usually, made, of, silver, the, greek, drachma, coin, including, the, tetradrachm, was, the, standard, currency, used, throughout, the, parthian, empire, the, arsacids, maintained, royal, mints, at, the, cities, of, hecatompylos, seleucia, and, ecbatana, they, most, likely, operated, a, mint, at, mithridatkert, nisa, as, well, from, the, empire, s, inception, until, its, collapse, drachmas, produced, throughout, the, parthian, period, rarely, weighed, less, than, 3, 5, g, or, more, than, 4, 2, g, the, first, parthian, tetradrachms, weighing, in, principle, around, 16, g, with, some, variation, appear, after, mithridates, i, conquered, mesopotamia, and, were, minted, exclusively, at, seleucia, although, greek, culture, of, the, seleucids, was, widely, adopted, by, peoples, of, the, near, east, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, parthian, era, witnessed, an, iranian, cultural, revival, in, religion, the, arts, and, even, clothing, fashions, conscious, of, both, the, hellenistic, and, persian, cultural, roots, of, their, kingship, the, arsacid, rulers, styled, themselves, after, the, persian, king, of, kings, and, affirmed, that, they, were, also, philhellenes, friends, of, the, greeks, the, word, philhellene, was, inscribed, on, parthian, coins, until, the, reign, of, artabanus, ii, the, discontinuation, of, this, phrase, signified, the, revival, of, iranian, culture, in, parthia, vologases, i, was, the, first, arsacid, ruler, to, have, the, parthian, script, and, language, appear, on, his, minted, coins, alongside, the, now, almost, illegible, greek, however, the, use, of, greek, alphabet, legends, on, parthian, coins, remained, until, the, collapse, of, the, empire, greek, cultural, influence, did, not, disappear, from, the, parthian, empire, however, and, there, is, evidence, that, the, arsacids, enjoyed, greek, theatre, when, the, head, of, crassus, was, brought, to, orodes, ii, he, alongside, armenian, king, artavasdes, ii, were, busy, watching, a, performance, of, the, bacchae, by, the, playwright, euripides, c, 480, 406, bc, the, producer, of, the, play, decided, to, use, crassus, actual, severed, head, in, place, of, the, stage, prop, head, of, pentheus, on, his, coins, arsaces, i, is, depicted, in, apparel, similar, to, achaemenid, satraps, according, to, a, shahbazi, arsaces, deliberately, diverges, from, seleucid, coins, to, emphasize, his, nationalistic, and, royal, aspirations, and, he, calls, himself, k, rny, karny, greek, autocrator, a, title, already, borne, by, achaemenid, supreme, generals, such, as, cyrus, the, younger, in, line, with, achaemenid, traditions, rock, relief, images, of, arsacid, rulers, were, carved, at, mount, behistun, where, darius, i, of, persia, r, 522, 486, bc, made, royal, inscriptions, moreover, the, arsacids, claimed, familial, descent, from, artaxerxes, ii, of, persia, r, 404, 358, bc, as, a, means, to, bolster, their, legitimacy, in, ruling, over, former, achaemenid, territories, i, e, as, being, legitimate, successors, of, glorious, kings, of, ancient, iran, artabanus, ii, named, one, of, his, sons, darius, and, laid, claim, to, cyrus, heritage, the, arsacid, kings, chose, typical, zoroastrian, names, for, themselves, and, some, from, the, heroic, background, of, the, avesta, according, to, v, g, lukonin, the, parthians, also, adopted, the, use, of, the, babylonian, calendar, with, names, from, the, achaemenid, iranian, calendar, replacing, the, macedonian, calendar, of, the, seleucids, the, parthian, empire, being, culturally, and, politically, heterogeneous, had, a, variety, of, religious, systems, and, beliefs, the, most, widespread, being, those, dedicated, to, greek, and, iranian, cults, aside, from, a, minority, of, jews, and, early, christians, most, parthians, were, polytheistic, greek, and, iranian, deities, were, often, blended, together, as, one, for, example, zeus, was, often, equated, with, ahura, mazda, hades, with, angra, mainyu, aphrodite, and, hera, with, anahita, apollo, with, mithra, and, hermes, with, shamash, aside, from, the, main, gods, and, goddesses, each, ethnic, group, and, city, had, their, own, designated, deities, as, with, seleucid, rulers, parthian, art, indicates, that, the, arsacid, kings, viewed, themselves, as, gods, this, cult, of, the, ruler, was, perhaps, the, most, widespread, the, extent, of, arsacid, patronage, of, zoroastrianism, is, debated, in, modern, scholarship, the, followers, of, zoroaster, would, have, found, the, bloody, sacrifices, of, some, parthian, era, iranian, cults, to, be, unacceptable, however, there, is, evidence, that, vologases, i, encouraged, the, presence, of, zoroastrian, magi, priests, at, court, and, sponsored, the, compilation, of, sacred, zoroastrian, texts, which, later, formed, the, avesta, the, sasanian, court, would, later, adopt, zoroastrianism, as, the, official, state, religion, of, the, empire, although, mani, 216, 276, ad, the, founding, prophet, of, manichaeism, did, not, proclaim, his, first, religious, revelation, until, 228, 229, ad, bivar, asserts, that, his, new, faith, contained, elements, of, mandaean, belief, iranian, cosmogony, and, even, echoes, of, christianity, may, be, regarded, as, a, typical, reflection, of, the, mixed, religious, doctrines, of, the, late, arsacid, period, which, the, zoroastrian, orthodoxy, of, the, sasanians, was, soon, to, sweep, away, there, is, scant, archaeological, evidence, for, the, spread, of, buddhism, from, the, kushan, empire, into, iran, proper, however, it, is, known, from, chinese, sources, that, an, shigao, fl, 2nd, century, ad, a, parthian, nobleman, and, buddhist, monk, traveled, to, luoyang, in, han, china, as, a, buddhist, missionary, and, translated, several, buddhist, canons, into, chinese, parthian, art, can, be, divided, into, three, geo, historical, phases, the, art, of, parthia, proper, the, art, of, the, iranian, plateau, and, the, art, of, parthian, mesopotamia, the, first, genuine, parthian, art, found, at, mithridatkert, nisa, combined, elements, of, greek, and, iranian, art, in, line, with, achaemenid, and, seleucid, traditions, in, the, second, phase, parthian, art, found, inspiration, in, achaemenid, art, as, exemplified, by, the, investiture, relief, of, mithridates, ii, at, mount, behistun, the, third, phase, occurred, gradually, after, the, parthian, conquest, of, mesopotamia, common, motifs, of, the, parthian, period, include, scenes, of, royal, hunting, expeditions, and, the, investiture, of, arsacid, kings, use, of, these, motifs, extended, to, include, portrayals, of, local, rulers, common, art, mediums, were, rock, reliefs, frescos, and, even, graffiti, geometric, and, stylized, plant, patterns, were, also, used, on, stucco, and, plaster, walls, the, common, motif, of, the, sasanian, period, showing, two, horsemen, engaged, in, combat, with, lances, first, appeared, in, the, parthian, reliefs, at, mount, behistun, in, portraiture, the, parthians, favored, and, emphasized, frontality, meaning, the, person, depicted, by, painting, sculpture, or, raised, relief, on, coins, faced, the, viewer, directly, instead, of, showing, his, or, her, profile, although, frontality, in, portraiture, was, already, an, old, artistic, technique, by, the, parthian, period, daniel, schlumberger, explains, the, innovation, of, parthian, frontality, parthian, frontality, as, we, are, now, accustomed, to, call, it, deeply, differs, both, from, ancient, near, eastern, and, from, greek, frontality, though, it, is, no, doubt, an, offspring, of, the, latter, for, both, in, oriental, art, and, in, greek, art, frontality, was, an, exceptional, treatment, in, oriental, art, it, was, a, treatment, strictly, reserved, for, a, small, number, of, traditional, characters, of, cult, and, myth, in, greek, art, it, was, an, option, resorted, to, only, for, definite, reasons, when, demanded, by, the, subject, and, on, the, whole, seldom, made, use, of, with, parthian, art, on, the, contrary, frontality, becomes, the, normal, treatment, of, the, figure, for, the, parthians, frontality, is, really, nothing, but, the, habit, of, showing, in, relief, and, in, painting, all, figures, full, face, even, at, the, expense, as, it, seems, to, us, moderns, of, clearness, and, intelligibility, so, systematic, is, this, use, that, it, amounts, to, a, complete, banishment, de, facto, of, the, side, view, and, of, all, intermediate, attitudes, this, singular, state, of, things, seems, to, have, become, established, in, the, course, of, the, 1st, century, a, d, parthian, art, with, its, distinct, use, of, frontality, in, portraiture, was, lost, and, abandoned, with, the, profound, cultural, and, political, changes, brought, by, the, sasanian, empire, however, even, after, the, roman, occupation, of, dura, europos, in, 165, ad, the, use, of, parthian, frontality, in, portraiture, continued, to, flourish, there, this, is, exemplified, by, the, early, 3rd, century, ad, wall, murals, of, the, dura, europos, synagogue, a, temple, in, the, same, city, dedicated, to, palmyrene, gods, and, the, local, mithraeum, parthian, architecture, adopted, elements, of, achaemenid, and, greek, architecture, but, remained, distinct, from, the, two, the, style, is, first, attested, at, mithridatkert, nisa, the, round, hall, of, nisa, is, similar, to, hellenistic, palaces, but, different, in, that, it, forms, a, circle, and, vault, inside, a, square, space, however, the, artwork, of, nisa, including, marble, statues, and, the, carved, scenes, on, ivory, rhyton, vessels, is, unquestionably, influenced, by, greek, art, a, signature, feature, of, parthian, architecture, was, the, iwan, an, audience, hall, supported, by, arches, or, barrel, vaults, and, open, on, one, side, use, of, the, barrel, vault, replaced, the, hellenic, use, of, columns, to, support, roofs, although, the, iwan, was, known, during, the, achaemenid, period, and, earlier, in, smaller, and, subterranean, structures, it, was, the, parthians, who, first, built, them, on, a, monumental, scale, the, earliest, parthian, iwans, are, found, at, seleucia, built, in, the, early, 1st, century, ad, monumental, iwans, are, also, commonly, found, in, the, ancient, temples, of, hatra, and, perhaps, modeled, on, the, parthian, style, the, largest, parthian, iwans, at, that, site, have, a, span, of, 15, m, 50, ft, the, typical, parthian, riding, outfit, is, exemplified, by, the, famous, bronze, statue, of, a, parthian, nobleman, found, at, shami, elymais, standing, 1, 9, m, 6, ft, the, figure, wears, a, v, shaped, jacket, a, v, shaped, tunic, fastened, in, place, with, a, belt, loose, fitting, and, many, folded, trousers, held, by, garters, and, a, diadem, or, band, over, his, coiffed, bobbed, hair, his, outfit, is, commonly, seen, in, relief, images, of, parthian, coins, by, the, mid, 1st, century, bc, examples, of, clothing, in, parthian, inspired, sculptures, have, been, found, in, excavations, at, hatra, in, northwestern, iraq, statues, erected, there, feature, the, typical, parthian, shirt, qamis, combined, with, trousers, and, made, with, fine, ornamented, materials, the, aristocratic, elite, of, hatra, adopted, the, bobbed, hairstyles, headdresses, and, belted, tunics, worn, by, the, nobility, belonging, to, the, central, arsacid, court, the, trouser, suit, was, even, worn, by, the, arsacid, kings, as, shown, on, the, reverse, images, of, coins, the, parthian, trouser, suit, was, also, adopted, in, palmyra, syria, along, with, the, use, of, parthian, frontality, in, art, parthian, sculptures, depict, wealthy, women, wearing, long, sleeved, robes, over, a, dress, with, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and, headdresses, bedecked, in, jewelry, their, many, folded, dresses, were, fastened, by, a, brooch, at, one, shoulder, their, headdresses, also, featured, a, veil, which, was, draped, backwards, as, seen, in, parthian, coinage, the, headdresses, worn, by, the, parthian, kings, changed, over, time, the, earliest, arsacid, coins, show, rulers, wearing, the, soft, cap, with, cheek, flaps, known, as, the, bashlyk, greek, kyrbasia, this, may, have, derived, from, an, achaemenid, era, satrapal, headdress, and, the, pointy, hats, depicted, in, the, achaemenid, reliefs, at, behistun, and, persepolis, the, earliest, coins, of, mithridates, i, show, him, wearing, the, soft, cap, yet, coins, from, the, latter, part, of, his, reign, show, him, for, the, first, time, wearing, the, royal, hellenistic, diadem, mithridates, ii, was, the, first, to, be, shown, wearing, the, parthian, tiara, embroidered, with, pearls, and, jewels, a, headdress, commonly, worn, in, the, late, parthian, period, and, by, sasanian, monarchs, as, culturally, and, religiously, tolerant, as, the, parthians, were, they, adopted, greek, as, their, official, language, while, aramaic, remained, the, lingua, franca, in, the, empire, the, native, parthian, language, middle, persian, and, akkadian, were, also, used, it, is, known, that, during, the, parthian, period, the, court, minstrel, g, s, n, recited, poetic, oral, literature, accompanied, by, music, however, their, stories, composed, in, verse, form, were, not, written, down, until, the, subsequent, sassanian, period, in, fact, there, is, no, known, parthian, language, literature, that, survives, in, original, form, all, of, the, surviving, texts, were, written, down, in, the, following, centuries, it, is, believed, that, such, stories, as, the, romantic, tale, vis, and, r, min, and, epic, cycle, of, the, kayanian, dynasty, were, part, of, the, corpus, of, oral, literature, from, parthian, times, although, compiled, much, later, although, literature, of, the, parthian, language, was, not, committed, to, written, form, there, is, evidence, that, the, arsacids, acknowledged, and, respected, written, greek, literature, there, are, very, few, written, and, archeological, sources, about, the, position, of, women, in, the, parthian, empire, and, the, fragmentary, information, that, does, exist, is, only, about, royal, women, whose, position, shows, many, similarities, to, their, predecessors, in, the, achaemenid, empire, and, their, successors, in, the, sasanian, empire, the, parthian, kings, were, polygamous, and, had, several, wives, with, the, title, queen, referred, to, with, the, babylonian, spelling, arratu, or, the, greek, basilisse, as, well, as, concubines, it, is, known, that, kings, often, married, their, sisters, but, it, is, unknown, if, they, were, the, kings, full, sisters, or, half, sisters, according, to, roman, sources, parthian, kings, had, harems, full, of, female, slaves, and, hetairas, secluded, from, contact, with, men, and, royal, women, were, not, allowed, to, participate, in, the, royal, banquets, whether, the, royal, women, lived, in, seclusion, from, men, is, unknown, as, no, evidence, of, that, has, been, found, but, it, is, known, that, women, at, least, participated, in, the, royal, banquets, as, entertainers, as, women, are, shown, in, archeological, images, entertaining, at, such, occasions, with, music, and, dance, it, is, assumed, that, royal, parthian, women, could, own, and, manage, their, own, property, land, and, manufactures, as, could, their, predecessors, in, the, achaemenid, and, seleucid, empire, and, their, successors, in, the, sasanian, empire, it, is, fully, attested, that, royal, women, as, well, as, noblewomen, accompanied, their, husbands, in, battle, with, their, own, entourage, this, was, the, reason, why, female, members, of, the, royal, family, could, sometimes, be, taken, captive, by, enemies, and, had, to, be, ransomed, such, as, the, famous, occasion, when, the, daughter, of, king, osroes, was, held, captive, by, emperor, trajan,
