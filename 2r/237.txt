caucasian, eastern, and, southeastern, european, enslaved, mercenaries, slave, soldiers, and, freed, slaves, who, were, assigned, high, ranking, military, and, administrative, duties, serving, the, ruling, arab, and, ottoman, dynasties, in, the, muslim, world, the, most, enduring, mamluk, realm, was, the, knightly, military, class, in, medieval, egypt, which, developed, from, the, ranks, of, slave, soldiers, originally, the, mamluks, were, slaves, of, turkic, origins, from, the, eurasian, steppe, but, the, institution, of, military, slavery, spread, to, include, circassians, abkhazians, georgians, armenians, russians, and, hungarians, as, well, as, peoples, from, the, balkans, such, as, albanians, greeks, and, south, slavs, see, saqaliba, they, also, recruited, from, the, egyptians, the, mamluk, ghulam, phe, nom, enon, as, david, ayalon, dubbed, the, creation, of, the, specific, warrior, class, was, of, great, political, importance, for, one, thing, it, endured, for, nearly, 1, 000, years, from, the, 9th, century, to, the, early, 19th, century, over, time, mamluks, became, a, powerful, military, knightly, class, in, various, muslim, societies, that, were, controlled, by, dynastic, arab, rulers, particularly, in, egypt, and, syria, but, also, in, the, ottoman, empire, levant, mesopotamia, and, india, mamluks, held, political, and, military, power, in, some, cases, they, attained, the, rank, of, sultan, while, in, others, they, held, regional, power, as, emirs, or, beys, most, notably, mamluk, factions, seized, the, sultanate, centered, on, egypt, and, syria, and, controlled, it, as, the, mamluk, sultanate, 1250, 1517, the, mamluk, sultanate, famously, defeated, the, ilkhanate, at, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, they, had, earlier, fought, the, western, european, christian, crusaders, in, 1154, 1169, and, 1213, 1221, effectively, driving, them, out, of, egypt, and, the, levant, in, 1302, the, mamluk, sultanate, formally, expelled, the, last, crusaders, from, the, levant, ending, the, era, of, the, crusades, while, mamluks, were, purchased, as, property, their, status, was, above, ordinary, slaves, who, were, not, allowed, to, carry, weapons, or, perform, certain, tasks, in, places, such, as, egypt, from, the, ayyubid, dynasty, to, the, time, of, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, mamluks, were, considered, to, be, true, lords, and, true, warriors, with, social, status, above, the, general, population, in, egypt, and, the, levant, in, a, sense, they, were, like, enslaved, mercenaries, daniel, pipes, argued, that, the, first, indication, of, the, mamluk, military, class, was, rooted, in, the, practice, of, early, muslims, such, as, zubayr, ibn, al, awwam, and, uthman, ibn, affan, who, before, islam, owned, many, slaves, and, practiced, mawla, islamic, manumission, of, slaves, the, zubayrids, army, under, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, son, of, zubayr, used, these, freed, slave, retainers, during, the, second, civil, war, meanwhile, historians, agree, that, the, massive, implementation, of, a, slave, military, class, such, as, the, mamluks, appears, to, have, developed, in, islamic, societies, beginning, with, the, 9th, century, abbasid, caliphate, based, in, baghdad, under, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mu, ta, im, until, the, 1990s, it, was, widely, believed, that, the, earliest, mamluks, were, known, as, ghilman, or, ghulam, another, broadly, synonymous, term, for, slaves, and, were, bought, by, the, abbasid, caliphs, especially, al, mu, ta, im, 833, 842, by, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, such, slave, warriors, had, become, the, dominant, element, in, the, military, conflict, between, the, ghilman, and, the, population, of, baghdad, prompted, the, caliph, al, mu, ta, im, to, move, his, capital, to, the, city, of, samarra, but, this, did, not, succeed, in, calming, tensions, the, caliph, al, mutawakkil, was, assassinated, by, some, of, these, slave, soldiers, in, 861, see, anarchy, at, samarra, since, the, early, 21st, century, historians, have, suggested, that, there, was, a, distinction, between, the, mamluk, system, and, the, earlier, ghilman, system, in, samarra, which, did, not, have, specialized, training, and, was, based, on, pre, existing, central, asian, hierarchies, adult, slaves, and, freemen, both, served, as, warriors, in, the, ghilman, system, the, mamluk, system, developed, later, after, the, return, of, the, caliphate, to, baghdad, in, the, 870s, it, included, the, systematic, training, of, young, slaves, in, military, and, martial, skills, the, mamluk, system, is, considered, to, have, been, a, small, scale, experiment, of, al, muwaffaq, to, combine, the, slaves, efficiency, as, warriors, with, improved, reliability, this, recent, interpretation, seems, to, have, been, accepted, after, the, fragmentation, of, the, abbasid, empire, military, slaves, known, as, either, mamluks, or, ghilman, were, used, throughout, the, islamic, world, as, the, basis, of, military, power, the, fatimid, caliphate, 909, 1171, of, egypt, had, forcibly, taken, adolescent, male, armenians, turks, sudanese, and, copts, from, their, families, to, be, trained, as, slave, soldiers, they, formed, the, bulk, of, their, military, and, the, rulers, selected, prized, slaves, to, serve, in, their, administration, the, powerful, vizier, badr, al, jamali, for, example, was, a, mamluk, from, armenia, in, iran, and, iraq, the, buyid, dynasty, used, turkic, slaves, throughout, their, empire, the, rebel, al, basasiri, was, a, mamluk, who, eventually, ushered, in, seljuq, dynastic, rule, in, baghdad, after, attempting, a, failed, rebellion, when, the, later, abbasids, regained, military, control, over, iraq, they, also, relied, on, the, ghilman, as, their, warriors, under, saladin, and, the, ayyubids, of, egypt, the, power, of, the, mamluks, increased, and, they, claimed, the, sultanate, in, 1250, ruling, as, the, mamluk, sultanate, throughout, the, islamic, world, rulers, continued, to, use, enslaved, warriors, until, the, 19th, century, the, ottoman, empire, s, dev, irme, or, gathering, of, young, slaves, for, the, janissaries, lasted, until, the, 17th, century, regimes, based, on, mamluk, power, thrived, in, such, ottoman, provinces, as, the, levant, and, egypt, until, the, 19th, century, under, the, mamluk, sultanate, of, cairo, mamluks, were, purchased, while, still, young, males, they, were, raised, in, the, barracks, of, the, citadel, of, cairo, because, of, their, isolated, social, status, no, social, ties, or, political, affiliations, and, their, austere, military, training, they, were, trusted, to, be, loyal, to, their, rulers, when, their, training, was, completed, they, were, discharged, but, remained, attached, to, the, patron, who, had, purchased, them, mamluks, relied, on, the, help, of, their, patron, for, career, advancement, and, likewise, the, patron, s, reputation, and, power, depended, on, his, recruits, a, mamluk, was, bound, by, a, strong, esprit, de, corps, to, his, peers, in, the, same, household, mamluks, lived, within, their, garrisons, and, mainly, spent, their, time, with, each, other, their, entertainments, included, sporting, events, such, as, archery, competitions, and, presentations, of, mounted, combat, skills, at, least, once, a, week, the, intensive, and, rigorous, training, of, each, new, recruit, helped, ensure, continuity, of, mamluk, practices, sultans, owned, the, largest, number, of, mamluks, but, lesser, amirs, also, owned, their, own, troops, many, mamluks, were, appointed, or, promoted, to, high, positions, throughout, the, empire, including, army, command, at, first, their, status, was, non, hereditary, sons, of, mamluks, were, prevented, from, following, their, father, s, role, in, life, however, over, time, in, places, such, as, egypt, the, mamluk, forces, became, linked, to, existing, power, structures, and, gained, significant, amounts, of, influence, on, those, powers, in, egypt, studies, have, shown, that, mamluks, from, georgia, retained, their, native, language, were, aware, of, the, politics, of, the, caucasus, region, and, received, frequent, visits, from, their, parents, or, other, relatives, in, addition, they, sent, gifts, to, family, members, or, gave, money, to, build, useful, structures, a, defensive, tower, or, even, a, church, in, their, native, villages, the, practice, of, recruiting, slaves, as, soldiers, in, the, muslim, world, and, turning, them, into, mamluks, began, in, baghdad, during, the, 9th, century, ce, and, was, started, by, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mu, ta, im, from, the, 900s, through, the, 1200s, medieval, egypt, was, controlled, by, dynastic, foreign, rulers, notably, the, ikhshidids, fatimids, and, ayyubids, throughout, these, dynasties, thousands, of, mamluk, slave, soldiers, and, guards, continued, to, be, used, and, even, took, high, offices, this, increasing, level, of, influence, among, the, mamluks, worried, the, ayyubids, in, particular, eventually, a, mamluk, rose, to, become, sultan, of, egypt, the, mamluks, in, medieval, egypt, were, predominantly, of, white, turkic, and, circassian, origins, and, most, of, them, descended, from, enslaved, christians, after, they, were, taken, from, their, families, they, became, renegades, because, egyptian, mamluks, were, enslaved, christians, muslim, rulers, and, clerics, did, not, believe, they, were, true, believers, of, islam, despite, the, fact, that, they, were, deployed, for, fighting, in, wars, on, behalf, of, several, islamic, kingdoms, as, slave, soldiers, by, 1200, saladin, s, brother, al, dil, succeeded, in, securing, control, over, the, whole, empire, by, defeating, and, killing, or, imprisoning, his, brothers, and, nephews, in, turn, with, each, victory, al, dil, incorporated, the, defeated, mamluk, retinue, into, his, own, this, process, was, repeated, at, al, dil, s, death, in, 1218, and, at, his, son, al, k, mil, s, death, in, 1238, the, ayyubids, became, increasingly, surrounded, by, the, mamluks, who, acted, semi, autonomously, as, regional, atabegs, the, mamluks, increasingly, became, involved, in, the, internal, court, politics, of, the, kingdom, itself, as, various, factions, used, them, as, allies, in, june, 1249, the, seventh, crusade, under, louis, ix,

the, europeans, and, turks, would, eventually, weaken, them, to, the, point, of, collapse, on, 1, march, 1811, muhammad, ali, invited, all, of, the, leading, mamluks, to, his, palace, to, celebrate, the, declaration, of, war, against, the, wahhabis, in, arabia, between, 600, and, 700, mamluks, paraded, for, this, purpose, in, cairo, muhammad, ali, s, forces, killed, almost, all, of, these, near, the, al, azab, gates, in, a, narrow, road, down, from, mukatam, hill, this, ambush, came, to, be, known, as, the, massacre, of, the, citadel, according, to, contemporary, reports, only, one, mamluk, whose, name, is, given, variously, as, amim, also, amyn, or, heshjukur, a, besleney, survived, when, he, forced, his, horse, to, leap, from, the, walls, of, the, citadel, during, the, following, week, an, estimated, 3, 000, mamluks, and, their, relatives, were, killed, throughout, egypt, by, muhammad, s, regular, troops, in, the, citadel, of, cairo, alone, more, than, 1, 000, mamluks, died, despite, muhammad, ali, s, destruction, of, the, mamluks, in, egypt, a, party, of, them, escaped, and, fled, south, into, what, is, now, sudan, in, 1811, these, mamluks, established, a, state, at, dunqulah, in, the, sennar, as, a, base, for, their, slave, trading, in, 1820, the, sultan, of, sennar, informed, muhammad, ali, that, he, was, unable, to, comply, with, a, demand, to, expel, the, mamluks, in, response, the, pasha, sent, 4, 000, troops, to, invade, sudan, clear, it, of, mamluks, and, reclaim, it, for, egypt, the, pasha, s, forces, received, the, submission, of, the, kashif, dispersed, the, dunqulah, mamluks, conquered, kordofan, and, accepted, sennar, s, surrender, from, the, last, funj, sultan, badi, vii, according, to, eric, chaney, and, lisa, blades, the, reliance, on, mamluks, by, muslim, rulers, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, arab, world, s, political, development, they, argue, that, because, european, rulers, had, to, rely, on, local, elites, for, military, forces, lords, and, bourgeois, acquired, the, necessary, bargaining, power, to, push, for, representative, government, muslim, rulers, did, not, face, the, same, pressures, partly, because, the, mamluks, allowed, the, sultans, to, bypass, local, elites, there, were, various, places, in, which, mamluks, gained, political, or, military, power, as, a, self, replicating, military, community, some, examples, of, this, can, be, seen, in, the, tripolitania, region, of, libya, where, mamluk, governors, instated, their, various, policies, under, the, ottoman, empire, until, october, 18, 1912, when, italian, forces, took, over, the, region, in, the, italo, turkish, war, in, 1206, the, mamluk, commander, of, the, muslim, forces, in, the, indian, subcontinent, qutb, al, din, aibak, proclaimed, himself, sultan, creating, the, mamluk, sultanate, in, delhi, which, lasted, until, 1290, mamluk, corps, were, first, introduced, in, iraq, by, hassan, pasha, of, baghdad, in, 1702, from,
