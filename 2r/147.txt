the, indo, greek, kingdom, or, graeco, indian, kingdom, also, known, as, the, yavana, kingdom, also, yavanarajya, after, the, word, yona, which, comes, from, ionians, was, a, hellenistic, era, greek, kingdom, covering, various, parts, of, modern, day, afghanistan, pakistan, and, northwestern, india, it, existed, from, c, 200, bc, to, c, 10, ad, the, term, indo, greek, kingdom, loosely, describes, a, number, of, various, hellenistic, states, ruling, from, regional, capitals, like, taxila, sagala, pushkalavati, and, alexandria, in, the, caucasus, now, bagram, other, centers, are, only, hinted, at, e, g, ptolemy, s, geographia, and, the, nomenclature, of, later, kings, suggest, that, a, certain, theophilus, in, the, south, of, the, indo, greek, sphere, of, influence, may, also, have, been, a, royal, seat, at, one, time, the, kingdom, was, founded, when, the, graeco, bactrian, king, demetrius, i, of, bactria, invaded, india, from, bactria, in, about, 200, bc, the, greeks, to, the, east, of, the, seleucid, empire, were, eventually, divided, from, the, graeco, bactrian, kingdom, and, the, indo, greek, kingdoms, in, the, north, western, indian, subcontinent, during, the, two, centuries, of, their, rule, the, indo, greek, kings, combined, the, greek, and, indian, languages, and, symbols, as, seen, on, their, coins, and, blended, greek, and, indian, ideas, as, seen, in, the, archaeological, remains, the, diffusion, of, indo, greek, culture, had, consequences, which, are, still, felt, today, particularly, through, the, influence, of, greco, buddhist, art, the, ethnicity, of, the, indo, greek, may, also, have, been, hybrid, to, some, degree, euthydemus, i, was, according, to, polybius, a, magnesian, greek, his, son, demetrius, i, founder, of, the, indo, greek, kingdom, was, therefore, of, greek, ethnicity, at, least, by, his, father, a, marriage, treaty, was, arranged, for, the, same, demetrius, with, a, daughter, of, the, seleucid, ruler, antiochus, iii, the, ethnicity, of, later, indo, greek, rulers, is, sometimes, less, clear, for, example, artemidoros, 80, bc, was, supposed, to, have, been, of, indo, scythian, descent, although, he, is, now, seen, as, a, regular, indo, greek, king, menander, i, soter, being, the, most, well, known, amongst, the, indo, greek, kings, is, often, referred, to, simply, as, menander, despite, the, fact, that, there, was, indeed, another, indo, greek, king, known, as, menander, ii, menander, i, s, capital, was, at, sagala, in, the, punjab, present, day, sialkot, following, the, death, of, menander, most, of, his, empire, splintered, and, indo, greek, influence, was, considerably, reduced, many, new, kingdoms, and, republics, east, of, the, ravi, river, began, to, mint, new, coinage, depicting, military, victories, the, most, prominent, entities, to, form, were, the, yaudheya, republic, arjunayanas, and, the, audumbaras, the, yaudheyas, and, arjunayanas, both, are, said, to, have, won, victory, by, the, sword, the, datta, dynasty, and, mitra, dynasty, soon, followed, in, mathura, the, indo, greeks, ultimately, disappeared, as, a, political, entity, around, 10, ad, following, the, invasions, of, the, indo, scythians, although, pockets, of, greek, populations, probably, remained, for, several, centuries, longer, under, the, subsequent, rule, of, the, indo, parthians, the, kushans, and, the, indo, scythians, whose, western, satraps, state, lingered, on, encompassing, local, greeks, up, to, 415, ce, greeks, first, began, to, settle, the, northwestern, part, of, the, indian, subcontinent, during, the, time, of, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, darius, the, great, conquered, the, area, but, along, with, his, successors, also, conquered, much, of, the, greek, world, which, at, the, time, included, all, of, the, western, anatolian, peninsula, when, greek, villages, rebelled, under, the, persian, yoke, they, were, sometimes, ethnically, cleansed, by, relocation, to, the, far, side, of, the, empire, thus, there, came, to, be, many, greek, communities, in, the, indian, parts, of, the, persian, empire, in, the, fourth, century, bc, alexander, the, great, defeated, and, conquered, the, persian, empire, in, 326, bc, this, included, the, northwestern, part, of, the, indian, subcontinent, as, far, as, the, hyphasis, river, alexander, established, satrapies, and, founded, several, settlements, including, bucephala, he, turned, south, when, his, troops, refused, to, go, further, east, the, indian, satrapies, of, the, punjab, were, left, to, the, rule, of, porus, and, taxiles, who, were, confirmed, again, at, the, treaty, of, triparadisus, in, 321, bc, and, the, remaining, greek, troops, in, these, satrapies, were, left, under, the, command, of, alexander, s, general, eudemus, after, 321, bc, eudemus, toppled, taxiles, until, he, left, india, in, 316, bc, to, the, south, another, general, also, ruled, over, the, greek, colonies, of, the, indus, peithon, son, of, agenor, until, his, departure, for, babylon, in, 316, bc, around, 322, bc, the, greeks, described, as, yona, or, yavana, in, indian, sources, may, then, have, participated, together, with, other, groups, in, the, uprising, of, chandragupta, maurya, against, the, nanda, dynasty, and, gone, as, far, as, pataliputra, for, the, capture, of, the, city, from, the, nandas, the, mudrarakshasa, of, visakhadutta, as, well, as, the, jaina, work, parisishtaparvan, talk, of, chandragupta, s, alliance, with, the, himalayan, king, parvatka, often, identified, with, porus, and, according, to, these, accounts, this, alliance, gave, chandragupta, a, composite, and, powerful, army, made, up, of, yavanas, greeks, kambojas, shakas, scythians, kiratas, nepalese, parasikas, persians, and, bahlikas, bactrians, who, took, pataliputra, in, 305, bc, seleucus, i, led, an, army, to, the, indus, where, he, encountered, chandragupta, the, confrontation, ended, with, a, peace, treaty, and, an, intermarriage, agreement, epigamia, greek, meaning, either, a, dynastic, marriage, or, an, agreement, for, intermarriage, between, indians, and, greeks, accordingly, seleucus, ceded, his, eastern, territories, to, chandragupta, possibly, as, far, as, arachosia, and, received, 500, war, elephants, which, played, a, key, role, in, seleucus, s, victory, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, the, indians, occupy, in, part, some, of, the, countries, situated, along, the, indus, which, formerly, belonged, to, the, persians, alexander, deprived, the, ariani, of, them, and, established, there, settlements, of, his, own, but, seleucus, nicator, gave, them, to, sandrocottus, in, consequence, of, a, marriage, contract, and, received, in, return, five, hundred, elephants, the, details, of, the, marriage, agreement, are, not, known, but, since, the, extensive, sources, available, on, seleucus, never, mention, an, indian, princess, it, is, thought, that, the, marital, alliance, went, the, other, way, with, chandragupta, himself, or, his, son, bindusara, marrying, a, seleucid, princess, in, accordance, with, contemporary, greek, practices, to, form, dynastic, alliances, an, indian, puranic, source, the, pratisarga, parva, of, the, bhavishya, purana, described, the, marriage, of, chandragupta, with, a, greek, yavana, princess, daughter, of, seleucus, before, accurately, detailing, early, mauryan, genealogy, chandragupta, married, with, a, daughter, of, suluva, the, yavana, king, of, pausasa, thus, he, mixed, the, buddhists, and, the, yavanas, he, ruled, for, 60, years, from, him, vindusara, was, born, and, ruled, for, the, same, number, of, years, as, his, father, his, son, was, ashoka, chandragupta, however, followed, jainism, until, the, end, of, his, life, he, got, in, his, court, for, marriage, the, daughter, of, seleucus, nicator, berenice, suvarnnaksi, and, thus, he, mixed, the, indians, and, the, greeks, his, grandson, ashoka, as, woodcock, and, other, scholars, have, suggested, may, in, fact, have, been, half, or, at, least, a, quarter, greek, also, several, greeks, such, as, the, historian, megasthenes, followed, by, deimachus, and, dionysius, were, sent, to, reside, at, the, mauryan, court, presents, continued, to, be, exchanged, between, the, two, rulers, the, intensity, of, these, contacts, is, testified, by, the, existence, of, a, dedicated, mauryan, state, department, for, greek, yavana, and, persian, foreigners, or, the, remains, of, hellenistic, pottery, that, can, be, found, throughout, northern, india, on, these, occasions, greek, populations, apparently, remained, in, the, northwest, of, the, indian, subcontinent, under, mauryan, rule, chandragupta, s, grandson, ashoka, who, had, converted, to, the, buddhist, faith, declared, in, the, edicts, of, ashoka, set, in, stone, some, of, them, written, in, greek, that, greek, populations, within, his, realm, also, had, converted, to, buddhism, here, in, the, king, s, domain, among, the, greeks, the, kambojas, the, nabhakas, the, nabhapamkits, the, bhojas, the, pitinikas, the, andhras, and, the, palidas, everywhere, people, are, following, beloved, of, the, gods, instructions, in, dharma, in, his, edicts, ashoka, mentions, that, he, had, sent, buddhist, emissaries, to, greek, rulers, as, far, as, the, mediterranean, edict, no, 13, and, that, he, developed, herbal, medicine, in, their, territories, for, the, welfare, of, humans, and, animals, edict, no, 2, the, greeks, in, india, even, seem, to, have, played, an, active, role, in, the, propagation, of, buddhism, as, some, of, the, emissaries, of, ashoka, such, as, dharmaraksita, or, the, teacher, mahadharmaraksita, are, described, in, pali, sources, as, leading, greek, yona, i, e, ionian, buddhist, monks, active, in, buddhist, proselytism, the, mahavamsa, xii, it, is, also, thought, that, greeks, contributed, to, the, sculptural, work, of, the, pillars, of, ashoka, and, more, generally, to, the, blossoming, of, mauryan, art, some, greeks, yavanas, may, have, played, an, administrative, role, in, the, territories, ruled, by, ashoka, the, junagadh, rock, inscription, of, rudradaman, records, that, during, the, rule, of, ashoka, a, yavana, king, governor, named, tushaspha, was, in, charge, in, the, area, of, girnar, gujarat, mentioning, his, role, in, the, construction, of, a, water, reservoir, again, in, 206, bc, the, seleucid, emperor, antiochus, led, an, army, to, the, kabul, valley, where, he, received, war, elephants, and, presents, from, the, local, king, sophagasenus, he, antiochus, crossed, the, caucasus, the, caucasus, indicus, or, paropamisus, mod, hind, k, sh, and, descended, into, india, renewed, his, friendship, with, sophagasenus, the, king, of, the, indians, received, more, elephants, until, he, had, a, hundred, and, fifty, altogether, and, having, once, more, provisioned, his, troops, set, out, again, personally, with, his, army, leaving, androsthenes, of, cyzicus, the, duty, of, taking, home, the, treasure, which, this, king, had, agreed, to, hand, over, to, him, alexander, had, also, established, several, colonies, in, neighbouring, bactria, such, as, alexandria, on, the, oxus, modern, ai, khanoum, and, alexandria, of, the, caucasus, medieval, kapisa, modern, bagram, after, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, bactria, came, under, the, control, of, seleucus, i, nicator, who, founded, the, seleucid, empire, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, was, founded, when, diodotus, i, the, satrap, of, bactria, and, probably, the, surrounding, provinces, seceded, from, the, seleucid, empire, around, 250, bc, the, preserved, ancient, sources, see, below, are, somewhat, contradictory, and, the, exact, date, of, bactrian, independence, has, not, been, settled, somewhat, simplified, there, is, a, high, chronology, c, 255, bc, and, a, low, chronology, c, 246, bc, for, diodotos, secession, the, high, chronology, has, the, advantage, of, explaining, why, the, seleucid, king, antiochus, ii, issued, very, few, coins, in, bactria, as, diodotos, would, have, become, independent, there, early, in, antiochus, reign, on, the, other, hand, the, low, chronology, from, the, mid, 240s, bc, has, the, advantage, of, connecting, the, secession, of, diodotus, i, with, the, third, syrian, war, a, catastrophic, conflict, for, the, seleucid, empire, diodotus, the, governor, of, the, thousand, cities, of, bactria, latin, theodotus, mille, urbium, bactrianarum, praefectus, defected, and, proclaimed, himself, king, all, the, other, people, of, the, orient, followed, his, example, and, seceded, from, the, macedonians, the, new, kingdom, highly, urbanized, and, considered, one, of, the, richest, of, the, orient, opulentissimum, illud, mille, urbium, bactrianum, imperium, the, extremely, prosperous, bactrian, empire, of, the, thousand, cities, justin, xli, 1, was, to, further, grow, in, power, and, engage, into, territorial, expansion, to, the, east, and, the, west, the, greeks, who, caused, bactria, to, revolt, grew, so, powerful, on, account, of, the, fertility, of, the, country, that, they, became, masters, not, only, of, ariana, but, also, of, india, as, apollodorus, of, artemita, says, and, more, tribes, were, subdued, by, them, than, by, alexander, their, cities, were, bactra, also, called, zariaspa, through, which, flows, a, river, bearing, the, same, name, and, emptying, into, the, oxus, and, darapsa, and, several, others, among, these, was, eucratidia, which, was, named, after, its, ruler, when, the, ruler, of, neighbouring, parthia, the, former, satrap, and, self, proclaimed, king, andragoras, was, eliminated, by, arsaces, the, rise, of, the, parthian, empire, cut, off, the, greco, bactrians, from, direct, contact, with, the, greek, world, overland, trade, continued, at, a, reduced, rate, while, sea, trade, between, greek, egypt, and, bactria, developed, diodotus, was, succeeded, by, his, son, diodotus, ii, who, allied, himself, with, the, parthian, arsaces, in, his, fight, against, seleucus, ii, soon, after, relieved, by, the, death, of, diodotus, arsaces, made, peace, and, concluded, an, alliance, with, his, son, also, by, the, name, of, diodotus, some, time, later, he, fought, against, seleucos, who, came, to, punish, the, rebels, and, he, prevailed, the, parthians, celebrated, this, day, as, the, one, that, marked, the, beginning, of, their, freedom, euthydemus, a, magnesian, greek, according, to, polybius, and, possibly, satrap, of, sogdiana, overthrew, diodotus, ii, around, 230, bc, and, started, his, own, dynasty, euthydemus, s, control, extended, to, sogdiana, going, beyond, the, city, of, alexandria, eschate, founded, by, alexander, the, great, in, ferghana, and, they, also, held, sogdiana, situated, above, bactriana, towards, the, east, between, the, oxus, river, which, forms, the, boundary, between, the, bactrians, and, the, sogdians, and, the, iaxartes, river, and, the, iaxartes, forms, also, the, boundary, between, the, sogdians, and, the, nomads, euthydemus, was, attacked, by, the, seleucid, ruler, antiochus, iii, around, 210, bc, although, he, commanded, 10, 000, horsemen, euthydemus, initially, lost, a, battle, on, the, arius, and, had, to, retreat, he, then, successfully, resisted, a, three, year, siege, in, the, fortified, city, of, bactra, modern, balkh, before, antiochus, finally, decided, to, recognize, the, new, ruler, and, to, offer, one, of, his, daughters, to, euthydemus, s, son, demetrius, around, 206, bc, classical, accounts, also, relate, that, euthydemus, negotiated, peace, with, antiochus, iii, by, suggesting, that, he, deserved, credit, for, overthrowing, the, original, rebel, diodotus, and, that, he, was, protecting, central, asia, from, nomadic, invasions, thanks, to, his, defensive, efforts, for, if, he, did, not, yield, to, this, demand, neither, of, them, would, be, safe, seeing, that, great, hordes, of, nomads, were, close, at, hand, who, were, a, danger, to, both, and, that, if, they, admitted, them, into, the, country, it, would, certainly, be, utterly, barbarised, following, the, departure, of, the, seleucid, army, the, bactrian, kingdom, seems, to, have, expanded, in, the, west, areas, in, north, eastern, iran, may, have, been, absorbed, possibly, as, far, as, into, parthia, whose, ruler, had, been, defeated, by, antiochus, the, great, these, territories, possibly, are, identical, with, the, bactrian, satrapies, of, tapuria, and, traxiane, to, the, north, euthydemus, also, ruled, sogdiana, and, ferghana, and, there, are, indications, that, from, alexandria, eschate, the, greco, bactrians, may, have, led, expeditions, as, far, as, kashgar, and, r, mqi, in, chinese, turkestan, leading, to, the, first, known, contacts, between, china, and, the, west, around, 220, bc, the, greek, historian, strabo, too, writes, that, they, extended, their, empire, even, as, far, as, the, seres, chinese, and, the, phryni, several, statuettes, and, representations, of, greek, soldiers, have, been, found, north, of, the, tien, shan, on, the, doorstep, to, china, and, are, today, on, display, in, the, xinjiang, museum, at, urumqi, boardman, greek, influences, on, chinese, art, have, also, been, suggested, hirth, rostovtzeff, designs, with, rosette, flowers, geometric, lines, and, glass, inlays, suggestive, of, hellenistic, influences, can, be, found, on, some, early, han, dynasty, bronze, mirrors, numismatics, also, suggest, that, some, technology, exchanges, may, have, occurred, on, these, occasions, the, greco, bactrians, were, the, first, in, the, world, to, issue, cupro, nickel, 75, 25, ratio, coins, an, alloy, technology, only, known, by, the, chinese, at, the, time, under, the, name, white, copper, some, weapons, from, the, warring, states, period, were, in, copper, nickel, alloy, the, practice, of, exporting, chinese, metals, in, particular, iron, for, trade, is, attested, around, that, period, kings, euthydemus, euthydemus, ii, agathocles, and, pantaleon, made, these, coin, issues, around, 170, bc, and, it, has, alternatively, been, suggested, that, a, nickeliferous, copper, ore, was, the, source, from, mines, at, anarak, copper, nickel, would, not, be, used, again, in, coinage, until, the, 19th, century, the, presence, of, chinese, people, in, the, indian, subcontinent, from, ancient, times, is, also, suggested, by, the, accounts, of, the, ci, as, in, the, mahabharata, and, the, manu, smriti, the, han, dynasty, explorer, and, ambassador, zhang, qian, visited, bactria, in, 126, bc, and, reported, the, presence, of, chinese, products, in, the, bactrian, markets, when, i, was, in, bactria, daxia, zhang, qian, reported, i, saw, bamboo, canes, from, qiong, and, cloth, made, in, the, province, of, shu, territories, of, southwestern, china, when, i, asked, the, people, how, they, had, gotten, such, articles, they, replied, our, merchants, go, buy, them, in, the, markets, of, shendu, india, upon, his, return, zhang, qian, informed, the, chinese, emperor, han, wudi, of, the, level, of, sophistication, of, the, urban, civilizations, of, ferghana, bactria, and, parthia, who, became, interested, in, developing, commercial, relationships, with, them, the, son, of, heaven, on, hearing, all, this, reasoned, thus, ferghana, dayuan, and, the, possessions, of, bactria, daxia, and, parthia, anxi, are, large, countries, full, of, rare, things, with, a, population, living, in, fixed, abodes, and, given, to, occupations, somewhat, identical, with, those, of, the, chinese, people, and, placing, great, value, on, the, rich, produce, of, china, a, number, of, chinese, envoys, were, then, sent, to, central, asia, triggering, the, development, of, the, silk, road, from, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, indian, emperor, chandragupta, founder, of, the, mauryan, dynasty, had, re, conquered, northwestern, india, upon, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, around, 322, bc, however, contacts, were, kept, with, his, greek, neighbours, in, the, seleucid, empire, a, dynastic, alliance, or, the, recognition, of, intermarriage, between, greeks, and, indians, were, established, described, as, an, agreement, on, epigamia, in, ancient, sources, and, several, greeks, such, as, the, historian, megasthenes, resided, at, the, mauryan, court, subsequently, each, mauryan, emperor, had, a, greek, ambassador, at, his, court, chandragupta, s, grandson, ashoka, converted, to, the, buddhist, faith, and, became, a, great, proselytizer, in, the, line, of, the, traditional, pali, canon, of, theravada, buddhism, directing, his, efforts, towards, the, indian, and, the, hellenistic, worlds, from, around, 250, bc, according, to, the, edicts, of, ashoka, set, in, stone, some, of, them, written, in, greek, he, sent, buddhist, emissaries, to, the, greek, lands, in, asia, and, as, far, as, the, mediterranean, the, edicts, name, each, of, the, rulers, of, the, hellenistic, world, at, the, time, the, conquest, by, dharma, has, been, won, here, on, the, borders, and, even, six, hundred, yojanas, 4, 000, miles, away, where, the, greek, king, antiochos, rules, beyond, there, where, the, four, kings, named, ptolemy, antigonos, magas, and, alexander, rule, likewise, in, the, south, among, the, cholas, the, pandyas, and, as, far, as, tamraparni, some, of, the, greek, populations, that, had, remained, in, northwestern, india, apparently, converted, to, buddhism, here, in, the, king, s, domain, among, the, greeks, the, kambojas, the, nabhakas, the, nabhapamkits, the, bhojas, the, pitinikas, the, andhras, and, the, palidas, everywhere, people, are, following, beloved, of, the, gods, instructions, in, dharma, furthermore, according, to, pali, sources, some, of, ashoka, s, emissaries, were, greek, buddhist, monks, indicating, close, religious, exchanges, between, the, two, cultures, when, the, thera, elder, moggaliputta, the, illuminator, of, the, religion, of, the, conqueror, ashoka, had, brought, the, third, council, to, an, end, he, sent, forth, theras, one, here, and, one, there, and, to, aparantaka, the, western, countries, corresponding, to, gujarat, and, sindh, he, sent, the, greek, yona, named, dhammarakkhita, and, the, thera, maharakkhita, he, sent, into, the, country, of, the, yona, greco, bactrians, probably, received, these, buddhist, emissaries, at, least, maharakkhita, lit, the, great, saved, one, who, was, sent, to, the, country, of, the, yona, and, somehow, tolerated, the, buddhist, faith, although, little, proof, remains, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, the, christian, dogmatist, clement, of, alexandria, recognized, the, existence, of, buddhist, sramanas, among, the, bactrians, bactrians, meaning, oriental, greeks, in, that, period, and, even, their, influence, on, greek, thought, thus, philosophy, a, thing, of, the, highest, utility, flourished, in, antiquity, among, the, barbarians, shedding, its, light, over, the, nations, and, afterwards, it, came, to, greece, first, in, its, ranks, were, the, prophets, of, the, egyptians, and, the, chaldeans, among, the, assyrians, and, the, druids, among, the, gauls, and, the, sramanas, among, the, bactrians, and, the, philosophers, of, the, celts, and, the, magi, of, the, persians, who, foretold, the, saviour, s, birth, and, came, into, the, land, of, judea, guided, by, a, star, the, indian, gymnosophists, are, also, in, the, number, and, the, other, barbarian, philosophers, and, of, these, there, are, two, classes, some, of, them, called, sramanas, and, others, brahmins, in, india, the, maurya, dynasty, was, overthrown, around, 185, bc, when, pushyamitra, shunga, the, commander, in, chief, of, mauryan, imperial, forces, and, a, brahmin, assassinated, the, last, of, the, mauryan, emperors, brihadratha, pushyamitra, shunga, then, ascended, the, throne, and, established, the, shunga, empire, which, extended, its, control, as, far, west, as, the, punjab, buddhist, sources, such, as, the, ashokavadana, mention, that, pushyamitra, was, hostile, towards, buddhists, and, allegedly, persecuted, the, buddhist, faith, a, large, number, of, buddhist, monasteries, viharas, were, allegedly, converted, to, hindu, temples, in, such, places, as, nalanda, bodhgaya, sarnath, or, mathura, while, it, is, established, by, secular, sources, that, hinduism, and, buddhism, were, in, competition, during, this, time, with, the, shungas, preferring, the, former, to, the, latter, historians, such, as, etienne, lamotte, and, romila, thapar, argue, that, buddhist, accounts, of, persecution, of, buddhists, by, shungas, are, largely, exaggerated, some, puranic, sources, however, also, describe, the, resurgence, of, brahmanism, following, the, maurya, dynasty, and, the, killing, of, millions, of, buddhists, such, as, the, pratisarga, parva, of, the, bhavishya, purana, at, this, time, the, best, of, the, brahmanas, kanyakubja, performed, sacrifice, on, the, top, of, a, mountain, named, arbuda, by, the, influence, of, vedic, mantras, four, kshatriyas, appeared, from, the, yajna, sacrifice, they, kept, ashoka, under, their, control, and, annihilated, all, the, buddhists, it, is, said, there, were, 4, million, buddhists, and, all, of, them, were, killed, by, uncommon, weapons, some, narrative, history, has, survived, for, most, of, the, hellenistic, world, at, least, of, the, kings, and, the, wars, this, is, lacking, for, india, the, main, greco, roman, source, on, the, indo, greeks, is, justin, who, wrote, an, anthology, drawn, from, the, roman, historian, pompeius, trogus, who, in, turn, wrote, from, greek, sources, at, the, time, of, augustus, caesar, in, addition, to, these, dozen, sentences, the, geographer, strabo, mentions, india, a, few, times, in, the, course, of, his, long, dispute, with, eratosthenes, about, the, shape, of, eurasia, most, of, these, are, purely, geographical, claims, but, he, does, mention, that, eratosthenes, sources, say, that, some, of, the, greek, kings, conquered, further, than, alexander, strabo, does, not, believe, them, on, this, nor, does, he, believe, that, menander, and, demetrius, son, of, euthydemus, conquered, more, tribes, than, alexander, there, is, half, a, story, about, menander, in, one, of, the, books, of, polybius, which, has, not, come, down, to, us, intact, there, are, indian, literary, sources, ranging, from, the, milinda, panha, a, dialogue, between, a, buddhist, sage, nagasena, and, indianized, names, that, may, be, related, to, indo, greek, kings, such, as, menander, i, names, in, these, sources, are, consistently, indianized, and, there, is, some, dispute, whether, for, example, dharmamitra, represents, demetrius, or, is, an, indian, prince, with, that, name, there, was, also, a, chinese, expedition, to, bactria, by, chang, k, ien, under, the, emperor, wu, of, han, recorded, in, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, and, book, of, the, former, han, with, additional, evidence, in, the, book, of, the, later, han, the, identification, of, places, and, peoples, behind, transcriptions, into, chinese, is, difficult, and, several, alternate, interpretations, have, been, proposed, other, evidence, of, the, broader, and, longer, influence, of, indo, greeks, is, possibly, suggested, by, yavanarajya, inscription, dated, to, the, 1st, century, bc, it, mentions, yavanas, a, term, which, is, derived, from, ionians, and, which, at, that, time, most, likely, means, indo, greeks, demetrius, i, the, son, of, euthydemus, is, generally, considered, the, greco, bactrian, king, who, first, launched, the, greek, expansion, into, india, he, is, therefore, the, founder, of, the, indo, greek, realm, the, true, intents, of, the, greek, kings, in, occupying, india, are, unknown, but, it, is, thought, that, the, elimination, of, the, maurya, empire, by, the, sunga, greatly, encouraged, this, expansion, the, indo, greeks, in, particular, menander, i, who, is, said, in, the, milindapanha, to, have, converted, to, buddhism, also, possibly, received, the, help, of, indian, buddhists, there, is, an, inscription, from, his, father, s, reign, already, officially, hailing, demetrius, as, victorious, he, also, has, one, of, the, few, absolute, dates, in, indo, greek, history, after, his, father, held, off, antiochus, iii, for, two, years, 208, 6, bc, the, peace, treaty, included, the, offer, of, a, marriage, between, demetrius, and, antiochus, daughter, coins, of, demetrius, i, have, been, found, in, arachosia, and, in, the, kabul, valley, the, latter, would, be, the, first, entry, of, the, greeks, into, india, as, they, defined, it, there, is, also, literary, evidence, for, a, campaign, eastward, against, the, seres, and, the, phryni, but, the, order, and, dating, of, these, conquests, is, uncertain, demetrius, i, seems, to, have, conquered, the, kabul, valley, arachosia, and, perhaps, gandhara, he, struck, no, indian, coins, so, either, his, conquests, did, not, penetrate, that, far, into, india, or, he, died, before, he, could, consolidate, them, on, his, coins, demetrius, i, always, carries, the, elephant, helmet, worn, by, alexander, which, seems, to, be, a, token, of, his, indian, conquests, bopearachchi, believes, that, demetrius, received, the, title, of, king, of, india, following, his, victories, south, of, the, hindu, kush, he, was, also, given, though, perhaps, only, posthumously, the, title, aniketos, lit, invincible, a, cult, title, of, heracles, which, alexander, had, assumed, the, later, indo, greek, kings, lysias, philoxenus, and, artemidorus, also, took, it, finally, demetrius, may, have, been, the, founder, of, a, newly, discovered, yavana, era, starting, in, 186, 5, bc, after, the, death, of, demetrius, the, bactrian, kings, pantaleon, and, agathocles, struck, the, first, bilingual, coins, with, indian, inscriptions, found, as, far, east, as, taxila, so, in, their, time, c, 185, 170, bc, the, bactrian, kingdom, seems, to, have, included, gandhara, these, first, bilingual, coins, used, the, brahmi, script, whereas, later, kings, would, generally, use, kharoshthi, they, also, went, as, far, as, incorporating, indian, deities, variously, interpreted, as, hindu, deities, or, the, buddha, they, also, included, various, indian, devices, lion, elephant, zebu, bull, and, symbols, some, of, them, buddhist, such, as, the, tree, in, railing, these, symbols, can, also, be, seen, in, the, post, mauryan, coinage, of, gandhara, the, hinduist, coinage, of, agathocles, is, few, but, spectacular, six, indian, standard, silver, drachmas, were, discovered, at, ai, khanoum, in, 1970, which, depict, hindu, deities, these, are, early, avatars, of, vishnu, balarama, sankarshana, with, attributes, consisting, of, the, gada, mace, and, the, plow, and, vasudeva, krishna, with, the, vishnu, attributes, of, the, shankha, a, pear, shaped, case, or, conch, and, the, sudarshana, chakra, wheel, these, first, attempts, at, incorporating, indian, culture, were, only, partly, preserved, by, later, kings, they, all, continued, to, struck, bilingual, coins, sometimes, in, addition, to, attic, coinage, but, greek, deities, remained, prevalent, indian, animals, however, such, as, the, elephant, the, bull, or, the, lion, possibly, with, religious, overtones, were, used, extensively, in, their, indian, standard, square, coinage, buddhist, wheels, dharmachakras, still, appear, in, the, coinage, of, menander, i, and, menander, ii, several, bactrian, kings, followed, after, demetrius, death, and, it, seems, likely, that, the, civil, wars, between, them, made, it, possible, for, apollodotus, i, from, c, 180, 175, bc, to, make, himself, independent, as, the, first, proper, indo, greek, king, who, did, not, rule, from, bactria, large, numbers, of, his, coins, have, been, found, in, india, and, he, seems, to, have, reigned, in, gandhara, as, well, as, western, punjab, apollodotus, i, was, succeeded, by, or, ruled, alongside, antimachus, ii, likely, the, son, of, the, bactrian, king, antimachus, i, the, next, important, indo, greek, king, was, menander, i, who, is, considered, to, have, been, the, most, successful, of, the, indo, greek, kings, and, who, expanded, the, kingdom, to, its, greatest, extent, by, means, of, his, various, conquests, the, finds, of, his, coins, are, the, most, numerous, and, occur, across, the, greatest, geographical, area, more, than, any, of, the, other, indo, greek, kings, coins, stamped, with, menander, s, likeness, can, be, found, as, far, away, as, eastern, punjab, over, 600, miles, distant, menander, seems, to, have, begun, a, second, wave, of, conquests, and, it, seems, likely, that, the, easternmost, conquests, were, made, by, him, thus, from, 165, bce, until, his, death, in, 130, bce, menander, i, ruled, punjab, with, sagala, as, his, capital, menander, subsequently, made, an, expedition, across, northern, india, to, mathura, where, the, yavnarajya, inscription, was, recorded, however, it, is, not, known, if, this, was, a, contiguous, empire, or, ruled, through, key, city, centers, or, polis, soon, after, eucratides, i, king, of, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, began, warring, with, the, indo, greeks, in, the, north, western, frontier, according, to, apollodorus, of, artemita, quoted, by, strabo, the, indo, greek, territory, for, a, while, included, the, indian, coastal, provinces, of, sindh, and, possibly, gujarat, with, archaeological, methods, the, indo, greek, territory, can, however, only, be, confirmed, from, the, kabul, valley, to, the, eastern, punjab, so, greek, presence, outside, was, probably, short, lived, or, non, existent, some, sources, also, claim, that, the, indo, greeks, may, have, reached, the, shunga, capital, pataliputra, in, northern, india, however, the, nature, of, this, expedition, is, a, matter, of, controversy, the, only, recorded, primary, account, regarding, this, campaign, was, written, in, the, yuga, purana, however, this, text, was, written, as, a, forthcoming, prophecy, of, an, impending, conflict, it, is, not, known, if, the, expedition, was, carried, out, or, if, the, yavanas, indo, greeks, were, successful, in, this, campaign, after, having, conquered, saketa, the, country, of, the, panchala, and, the, mathuras, the, yavanas, wicked, and, valiant, will, reach, kusumadhvaja, the, town, of, the, flower, standard, pataliputra, the, thick, mud, fortifications, at, pataliputra, being, reached, all, the, provinces, will, be, in, disorder, without, doubt, ultimately, a, great, battle, will, follow, with, tree, like, engines, siege, engines, however, the, claim, that, the, yavanas, held, pataliputra, is, not, supported, by, numismatic, or, historical, accounts, and, is, even, contradicted, by, some, inscriptions, king, kharavela, of, kalinga, during, his, forth, year, reigning, was, recorded, in, the, hathigumpha, inscription, to, have, routed, a, demoralized, indo, greek, army, back, to, mathura, it, is, not, known, which, indo, greek, was, leading, the, army, at, the, time, however, it, is, presumed, to, be, menander, i, or, perhaps, even, a, later, ruler, then, during, his, twelfth, year, in, power, kharavela, is, recorded, to, have, battled, the, shunga, empire, and, defeated, the, emperor, brhaspatimitra, known, as, pushyamitra, shunga, kharavela, is, then, stated, to, have, sacked, the, capital, pataliputra, and, reclaimed, the, jain, idols, and, treasures, that, had, been, plundered, from, kalinga, and, taken, to, pataliputra, based, on, the, chronology, and, date, during, 1st, century, bc, it, is, postulated, that, menander, was, the, one, leading, the, indo, greeks, during, kharavela, s, reign, then, in, the, eighth, year, kharavela, with, a, large, army, having, sacked, goradhagiri, causes, pressure, on, rajagaha, rajagriha, on, account, of, the, loud, report, of, this, act, of, valour, the, yavana, greek, king, dimi, retreated, to, mathura, having, extricated, his, demoralized, army, the, important, bactrian, king, eucratides, seems, to, have, attacked, the, indo, greek, kingdom, during, the, mid, 2nd, century, bc, a, demetrius, called, king, of, the, indians, seems, to, have, confronted, eucratides, in, a, four, month, siege, reported, by, justin, but, he, ultimately, lost, it, is, uncertain, who, this, demetrius, was, and, when, the, siege, happened, some, scholars, believe, that, it, was, demetrius, i, demetrius, i, was, probably, the, demetrius, who, besieged, eucratides, for, four, months, d, w, mac, dowall, pp, 201, 202, afghanistan, ancien, carrefour, entre, l, est, et, l, ouest, this, analysis, goes, against, bopearachchi, who, has, suggested, that, demetrius, i, died, long, before, eucratides, came, to, power, ref, in, any, case, eucratides, seems, to, have, occupied, territory, as, far, as, the, indus, between, ca, 170, bc, and, 150, bc, his, advances, were, ultimately, reclaimed, by, the, indo, greek, king, menander, i, menander, is, also, remembered, in, buddhist, literature, where, he, is, called, milinda, he, is, described, in, the, milinda, panha, as, a, convert, to, buddhism, and, that, he, became, an, arhat, whose, relics, were, enshrined, in, a, manner, reminiscent, of, a, buddha, he, also, introduced, a, new, coin, type, with, athena, alkidemos, protector, of, the, people, on, the, reverse, which, was, adopted, by, most, of, his, successors, in, the, east, following, the, death, of, menander, his, empire, was, greatly, reduced, due, to, the, emergence, of, new, kingdoms, and, republics, within, india, the, most, eminent, entities, to, reform, were, the, yaudheya, and, the, arjunayanas, which, were, military, confederations, that, had, been, annexed, by, the, maurya, empire, these, republics, began, to, mint, new, coins, mentioning, military, victories, that, were, reminiscent, of, indo, greek, type, coins, along, with, numismatic, evidence, the, junagadh, rock, inscription, of, rudradaman, details, the, conquests, of, the, saka, king, rudradaman, i, of, the, western, satraps, over, the, yaudheya, republic, reaffirming, their, independence, from, the, mid, 2nd, century, bc, the, scythians, in, turn, being, pushed, forward, by, the, yuezhi, who, were, completing, a, long, migration, from, the, border, of, china, started, to, invade, bactria, from, the, north, around, 130, bc, the, last, greco, bactrian, king, heliocles, was, probably, killed, during, the, invasion, and, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, proper, ceased, to, exist, the, parthians, also, probably, played, a, role, in, the, downfall, of, the, bactrian, kingdom, and, supplanted, the, scythians, there, are, however, no, historical, recordings, of, events, in, the, indo, greek, kingdom, after, menander, s, death, around, 130, bc, since, the, indo, greeks, had, now, become, very, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, graeco, roman, world, the, later, history, of, the, indo, greek, states, which, lasted, to, around, the, shift, bc, ad, is, reconstructed, almost, entirely, from, archaeological, and, numismatical, analyses, greek, presence, in, arachosia, where, greek, populations, had, been, living, since, before, the, acquisition, of, the, territory, by, chandragupta, from, seleucus, is, mentioned, by, isidore, of, charax, he, describes, greek, cities, there, one, of, them, called, demetrias, probably, in, honour, of, the, conqueror, demetrius, apollodotus, i, and, menander, i, were, mentioned, by, pompeius, trogus, as, important, indo, greek, kings, it, is, theorized, that, greek, advances, temporarily, went, as, far, as, the, shunga, capital, pataliputra, today, patna, in, eastern, india, senior, considers, that, these, conquests, can, only, refer, to, menander, against, this, john, mitchener, considers, that, the, greeks, probably, raided, the, indian, capital, of, pataliputra, during, the, time, of, demetrius, though, mitchener, s, analysis, is, not, based, on, numismatic, evidence, of, the, eastern, parts, of, india, then, there, have, become, known, to, us, all, those, parts, which, lie, this, side, of, the, hypanis, and, also, any, parts, beyond, the, hypanis, of, which, an, account, has, been, added, by, those, who, after, alexander, advanced, beyond, the, hypanis, to, the, ganges, and, pataliputra, the, seriousness, of, the, attack, is, in, some, doubt, menander, may, merely, have, joined, a, raid, led, by, indian, kings, down, the, ganges, as, indo, greek, presence, has, not, been, confirmed, this, far, east, to, the, south, the, greeks, may, have, occupied, the, areas, of, the, sindh, and, gujarat, including, the, strategic, harbour, of, barygaza, bharuch, conquests, also, attested, by, coins, dating, from, the, indo, greek, ruler, apollodotus, i, and, by, several, ancient, writers, strabo, 11, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, chap, 41, 47, the, greeks, took, possession, not, only, of, patalene, but, also, on, the, rest, of, the, coast, of, what, is, called, the, kingdom, of, saraostus, and, sigerdis, the, periplus, further, explains, ancient, indo, greek, rule, and, continued, circulation, of, indo, greek, coinage, in, the, region, to, the, present, day, ancient, drachmae, are, current, in, barygaza, coming, from, this, country, bearing, inscriptions, in, greek, letters, and, the, devices, of, those, who, reigned, after, alexander, apollodorus, and, menander, narain, however, dismisses, the, account, of, the, periplus, as, just, a, sailor, s, story, and, holds, that, coin, finds, are, not, necessarily, indicators, of, occupation, coin, hoards, further, suggest, that, in, central, india, the, area, of, malwa, may, also, have, been, conquered, from, numismatic, literary, and, epigraphic, evidence, it, seems, that, the, indo, greeks, also, had, control, over, mathura, during, the, period, between, 185, bce, and, 85, bce, and, especially, during, the, rule, of, menander, i, 165, 135, bc, ptolemy, mentioned, that, menander, s, ruler, extended, to, mathura, slightly, northwest, of, mathura, numerous, indo, greek, coins, were, found, in, the, city, of, khokrakot, modern, rohtak, belonging, to, as, many, as, 14, different, indo, greek, kings, as, well, as, coin, molds, in, naurangabad, suggesting, indo, greek, occupation, of, haryana, in, the, 2nd, 1st, centuries, bc, an, inscription, in, mathura, discovered, in, 1988, the, yavanarajya, inscription, mentions, the, last, day, of, year, 116, of, yavana, hegemony, yavanarajya, the, yavanarajya, probably, refers, to, the, rule, of, the, indo, greeks, in, mathura, as, late, as, around, 70, 60, bc, year, 116, of, the, yavana, era, the, extent, of, indo, greek, rule, in, mathura, has, been, disputed, but, it, is, also, known, that, no, remains, of, sunga, rule, have, been, found, in, mathura, and, their, territorial, control, is, only, proved, as, far, as, the, central, city, of, ayodhya, in, northern, central, india, through, the, dhanadeva, ayodhya, inscription, archeological, excavations, of, cast, die, struck, coins, have, also, revealed, the, presence, of, a, mitra, dynasty, coin, issuers, who, did, not, name, themselves, kings, on, their, coins, in, mathura, sometime, between, 150, bc, to, 20, bc, additionally, coins, belonging, to, a, datta, dynasty, have, also, been, excavated, in, mathura, whether, these, dynasties, ruled, independently, or, as, satraps, to, larger, kingdoms, is, unknown, several, figures, of, foreigners, appear, in, the, terracottas, of, mathura, art, from, the, 4th, to, the, 2nd, century, bce, which, are, either, described, simply, as, foreigners, or, persian, or, iranian, because, of, their, foreign, features, these, figurines, might, reflect, the, increased, contacts, of, indians, with, foreigners, during, this, period, several, of, these, seem, to, represent, foreign, soldiers, who, visited, india, during, the, mauryan, period, and, influenced, modellers, in, mathura, with, their, peculiar, ethnic, features, and, uniforms, a, helmeted, head, of, a, soldier, probably, indo, greek, is, also, known, and, dated, to, the, 1st, century, bce, now, in, the, mathura, museum, one, of, the, terracotta, statuettes, usually, nicknamed, the, persian, nobleman, and, dated, to, the, 2nd, century, bce, can, be, seen, wearing, a, coat, scarf, trousers, and, a, turban, mathura, may, then, have, been, conquered, by, the, mitra, dynasty, or, ruled, independently, by, the, datta, dynasty, during, the, 1st, century, bc, in, any, case, mathura, was, under, the, control, of, the, indo, scythian, northern, satraps, from, the, 1st, century, of, the, christian, era, the, term, yavana, is, thought, to, be, a, transliteration, of, ionians, and, is, known, to, have, designated, hellenistic, greeks, starting, with, the, edicts, of, ashoka, where, ashoka, writes, about, the, yavana, king, antiochus, but, may, have, sometimes, referred, to, other, foreigners, as, well, after, the, 1st, century, ad, patanjali, a, grammarian, and, commentator, on, p, ini, around, 150, bc, describes, in, the, mah, bh, sya, the, invasion, in, two, examples, using, the, imperfect, tense, sanskrit, denoting, a, recent, or, ongoing, events, the, brahmanical, text, of, the, yuga, purana, describes, events, in, the, form, of, a, prophecy, which, may, have, been, historical, relates, the, attack, of, the, indo, greeks, on, the, capital, pataliputra, a, magnificent, fortified, city, with, 570, towers, and, 64, gates, according, to, megasthenes, and, describes, the, ultimate, destruction, of, the, city, s, walls, then, after, having, approached, saketa, together, with, the, panchalas, and, the, mathuras, the, yavanas, valiant, in, battle, will, reach, kusumadhvaja, the, town, of, the, flower, standard, pataliputra, then, once, puspapura, another, name, of, pataliputra, has, been, reached, and, its, celebrated, mud, walls, cast, down, all, the, realm, will, be, in, disorder, accounts, of, battles, between, the, greeks, and, the, shunga, in, central, india, are, also, found, in, the, m, lavik, gnimitram, a, play, by, k, lid, sa, which, is, thought, to, describe, an, encounter, between, a, greek, cavalry, squadron, and, vasumitra, the, grandson, of, pushyamitra, during, the, latter, s, reign, by, the, sindh, river, or, the, kali, sindh, river, according, to, the, yuga, purana, the, yavanas, thereafter, will, retreat, following, internal, conflicts, the, yavanas, greeks, will, command, the, kings, will, disappear, but, ultimately, the, yavanas, intoxicated, with, fighting, will, not, stay, in, madhadesa, the, middle, country, there, will, be, undoubtedly, a, civil, war, among, them, arising, in, their, own, country, bactria, there, will, be, a, terrible, and, ferocious, war, gargi, samhita, yuga, purana, chapter, no7, according, to, mitchener, the, hathigumpha, inscription, indicates, the, presence, of, the, indo, greeks, led, by, a, ruler, listed, as, ta, from, mathura, during, the, 1st, century, bce, although, the, name, of, the, king, has, been, omitted, and, undeciphered, the, remaining, syllables, has, been, disputed, it, has, been, argued, by, tarn, to, be, referencing, the, ruler, demetrius, however, this, interpretation, is, disputed, by, other, historians, like, narain, which, point, out, the, discrepancies, in, chronology, and, the, fact, demetrius, didn, t, venture, past, punjab, instead, most, historians, now, theorize, it, to, be, the, indo, greek, ruler, menander, i, or, perhaps, a, later, yavana, king, from, mathura, then, in, the, eighth, year, kharavela, with, a, large, army, having, sacked, goradhagiri, causes, pressure, on, rajagaha, rajagriha, on, account, of, the, loud, report, of, this, act, of, valour, the, yavana, greek, king, dimi, retreated, to, mathura, having, extricated, his, demoralized, army, but, while, this, inscription, may, be, interpreted, as, an, indication, that, demetrius, i, was, the, king, who, made, conquests, in, punjab, it, is, still, true, that, he, never, issued, any, indian, standard, coins, only, numerous, coins, with, elephant, symbolism, and, the, restoration, of, his, name, in, kharosthi, on, the, hathigumpha, inscription, di, mi, ta, has, been, doubted, the, di, is, a, reconstruction, and, it, may, be, noted, that, the, name, of, another, indo, greek, king, amyntas, is, spelt, a, mi, ta, in, kharosthi, and, may, fit, in, therefore, menander, remains, the, likeliest, candidate, for, any, advance, east, of, punjab, menander, is, considered, to, have, been, probably, the, most, successful, indo, greek, king, and, the, conqueror, of, the, largest, territory, the, finds, of, his, coins, are, the, most, numerous, and, the, most, widespread, of, all, the, indo, greek, kings, menander, is, also, remembered, in, buddhist, literature, where, he, is, called, milinda, and, is, described, in, the, milinda, panha, as, a, convert, to, buddhism, he, became, an, arhat, whose, relics, were, enshrined, in, a, manner, reminiscent, of, the, buddha, he, also, introduced, a, new, coin, type, with, athena, alkidemos, protector, of, the, people, on, the, reverse, which, was, adopted, by, most, of, his, successors, in, the, east, from, the, mid, 2nd, century, bc, the, scythians, in, turn, being, pushed, forward, by, the, yuezhi, who, were, completing, a, long, migration, from, the, border, of, china, started, to, invade, bactria, from, the, north, around, 130, bc, the, last, greco, bactrian, king, heliocles, was, probably, killed, during, the, invasion, and, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, proper, ceased, to, exist, the, parthians, also, probably, played, a, role, in, the, downfall, of, the, bactrian, kingdom, immediately, after, the, fall, of, bactria, the, bronze, coins, of, indo, greek, king, zoilos, i, 130, 120, bc, successor, of, menander, in, the, western, part, of, the, indian, territories, combined, the, club, of, herakles, with, a, scythian, type, bowcase, and, short, recurve, bow, inside, a, victory, wreath, illustrating, interaction, with, horse, mounted, people, originating, from, the, steppes, possibly, either, the, scythians, future, indo, scythians, or, the, yuezhi, future, kushans, who, had, invaded, greco, bactria, this, bow, can, be, contrasted, to, the, traditional, hellenistic, long, bow, depicted, on, the, coins, of, the, eastern, indo, greek, queen, agathokleia, it, is, now, known, that, 50, years, later, the, indo, scythian, maues, was, in, alliance, with, the, indo, greek, kings, in, taxila, and, one, of, those, kings, artemidoros, seems, to, claim, on, his, coins, that, he, is, the, son, of, maues, although, this, is, now, disputed, the, extent, of, indo, greek, rule, is, still, uncertain, and, disputed, probable, members, of, the, dynasty, of, menander, include, the, ruling, queen, agathokleia, her, son, strato, i, and, nicias, though, it, is, uncertain, whether, they, ruled, directly, after, menander, other, kings, emerged, usually, in, the, western, part, of, the, indo, greek, realm, such, as, zoilos, i, lysias, antialcidas, and, philoxenos, these, rulers, may, have, been, relatives, of, either, the, eucratid, or, the, euthydemid, dynasties, the, names, of, later, kings, were, often, new, members, of, hellenistic, dynasties, usually, inherited, family, names, but, old, reverses, and, titles, were, frequently, repeated, by, the, later, rulers, immediately, after, the, fall, of, bactria, the, bronze, coins, of, indo, greek, king, zoilos, i, 130, 120, bc, successor, of, menander, in, the, western, part, of, the, indian, territories, combined, the, club, of, herakles, with, a, scythian, type, bowcase, and, short, recurve, bow, inside, a, victory, wreath, illustrating, interaction, with, horse, mounted, people, originating, from, the, steppes, possibly, either, the, scythians, future, indo, scythians, or, the, yuezhi, future, kushans, who, had, invaded, greco, bactria, this, bow, can, be, contrasted, to, the, traditional, hellenistic, long, bow, depicted, on, the, coins, of, the, eastern, indo, greek, queen, agathokleia, it, is, now, known, that, 50, years, later, the, indo, scythian, maues, was, in, alliance, with, the, indo, greek, kings, in, taxila, and, one, of, those, kings, artemidoros, seems, to, claim, on, his, coins, that, he, is, the, son, of, maues, although, this, is, now, disputed, while, all, indo, greek, kings, after, apollodotus, i, mainly, issued, bilingual, greek, and, kharoshti, coins, for, circulation, in, their, own, territories, several, of, them, also, struck, rare, greek, coins, which, have, been, found, in, bactria, the, later, kings, probably, struck, these, coins, as, some, kind, of, payment, to, the, scythian, or, yuezhi, tribes, who, now, ruled, there, though, if, as, tribute, or, payment, for, mercenaries, remains, unknown, for, some, decades, after, the, bactrian, invasion, relationships, seem, to, have, been, peaceful, between, the, indo, greeks, and, these, relatively, hellenised, nomad, tribes, it, is, around, this, time, in, 115, bc, that, the, embassy, of, heliodorus, from, king, antialkidas, to, the, court, of, the, sungas, king, bhagabhadra, in, vidisha, is, recorded, in, the, sunga, capital, heliodorus, established, the, heliodorus, pillar, in, a, dedication, to, v, sudeva, this, would, indicate, that, relations, between, the, indo, greeks, and, the, sungas, had, improved, by, that, time, that, people, traveled, between, the, two, realms, and, also, that, the, indo, greeks, readily, followed, indian, religions, also, around, the, same, period, circa, 115, bc, decorative, reliefs, were, introduced, for, the, first, time, at, nearby, sanchi, 6, km, away, from, vidisha, by, craftsmen, from, the, northwest, these, craftsmen, left, mason, s, marks, in, kharoshthi, mainly, used, in, the, area, around, gandhara, as, opposed, to, the, local, brahmi, script, this, seems, to, imply, that, these, foreign, workers, were, responsible, for, some, of, the, earliest, motifs, and, figures, that, can, be, found, on, the, railings, of, the, stupa, these, early, reliefs, at, sanchi, those, of, sanchi, stupa, no, 2, are, dated, to, 115, bc, while, the, more, extensive, pillar, carvings, are, dated, to, 80, bc, these, reliefs, have, been, described, as, the, oldest, extensive, stupa, decoration, in, existence, they, are, considered, the, origin, of, jataka, illustrations, in, india, a, warrior, figure, the, bharhut, yavana, appeared, prominently, on, a, high, relief, on, the, railings, of, the, stupa, of, bharhut, circa, 100, bc, the, warrior, has, the, flowing, head, band, of, a, greek, king, a, northern, tunic, with, hellenistic, pleats, he, hold, a, grape, in, his, hand, and, has, a, buddhist, triratana, symbol, on, his, sword, he, has, the, role, of, a, dvarapala, a, guardian, of, the, entrance, of, the, stupa, the, warrior, has, been, described, as, a, greek, some, have, suggested, that, he, might, even, represent, king, menander, also, around, that, time, craftsmen, from, the, gandhara, area, are, known, to, have, been, involved, in, the, construction, of, the, buddhist, torana, gateways, at, bharhut, which, are, dated, to, 100, 75, bc, this, is, because, mason, s, marks, in, kharosthi, have, been, found, on, several, elements, of, the, bharhut, remains, indicating, that, some, of, the, builders, at, least, came, from, the, north, particularly, from, gandhara, where, the, kharoshti, script, was, in, use, cunningham, explained, that, the, kharosthi, letters, were, found, on, the, balusters, between, the, architraves, of, the, gateway, but, none, on, the, railings, which, all, had, indian, markings, summarizing, that, the, gateways, which, are, artistically, more, refined, must, have, been, made, by, artists, from, the, north, whereas, the, railings, were, made, by, local, artists, again, in, sanchi, but, this, time, dating, to, the, period, of, satavahana, rule, circa, 50, 1, bc, one, frieze, can, be, observed, which, shows, devotees, in, greek, attire, making, a, dedication, to, the, great, stupa, of, sanchi, the, official, notice, at, sanchi, describes, foreigners, worshiping, stupa, the, men, are, depicted, with, short, curly, hair, often, held, together, with, a, headband, of, the, type, commonly, seen, on, greek, coins, the, clothing, too, is, greek, complete, with, tunics, cloaks, and, sandals, typical, of, the, greek, travelling, costume, the, musical, instruments, are, also, quite, characteristic, such, as, the, double, flute, called, aulos, also, visible, are, carnyx, like, horns, they, are, all, celebrating, at, the, entrance, of, the, stupa, the, actual, participation, of, yavanas, yonas, greek, donors, to, the, construction, of, sanchi, is, known, from, three, inscriptions, made, by, self, declared, yavana, donors, king, philoxenus, 100, 95, bc, briefly, occupied, the, whole, greek, territory, from, the, paropamisadae, to, western, punjab, after, that, the, territories, fragmented, again, between, smaller, indo, greek, kings, throughout, the, 1st, century, bc, the, indo, greeks, progressively, lost, ground, to, the, indians, in, the, east, and, the, scythians, the, yuezhi, and, the, parthians, in, the, west, about, 20, indo, greek, kings, are, known, during, this, period, down, to, the, last, known, indo, greek, rulers, strato, ii, and, strato, iii, who, ruled, in, the, punjab, region, until, around, 10, ad, around, eight, western, indo, greek, kings, are, known, most, of, them, are, distinguished, by, their, issues, of, attic, coins, for, circulation, in, the, neighbouring, region, one, of, the, last, important, kings, in, the, paropamisadae, part, of, the, hindu, kush, was, hermaeus, who, ruled, until, around, 80, bc, soon, after, his, death, the, yuezhi, or, sakas, took, over, his, areas, from, neighbouring, bactria, when, hermaeus, is, depicted, on, his, coins, riding, a, horse, he, is, equipped, with, the, recurve, bow, and, bow, case, of, the, steppes, and, rc, senior, believes, him, to, be, of, partly, nomad, origin, the, later, king, hippostratus, may, however, also, have, held, territories, in, the, paropamisadae, after, the, death, of, hermaeus, the, yuezhi, or, saka, nomads, became, the, new, rulers, of, the, paropamisadae, and, minted, vast, quantities, of, posthumous, issues, of, hermaeus, up, to, around, 40, ad, when, they, blend, with, the, coinage, of, the, kushan, king, kujula, kadphises, the, first, documented, yuezhi, prince, sapadbizes, ruled, around, 20, bc, and, minted, in, greek, and, in, the, same, style, as, the, western, indo, greek, kings, probably, depending, on, greek, mints, and, chelators, around, 80, bc, an, indo, scythian, king, named, maues, possibly, a, general, in, the, service, of, the, indo, greeks, ruled, for, a, few, years, in, northwestern, india, before, the, indo, greeks, again, took, control, he, seems, to, have, been, married, to, an, indo, greek, princess, named, machene, king, hippostratus, 65, 55, bc, seems, to, have, been, one, of, the, most, successful, subsequent, indo, greek, kings, until, he, lost, to, the, indo, scythian, azes, i, who, established, an, indo, scythian, dynasty, in, 48, 47, bc, various, coins, seem, to, suggest, that, some, sort, of, alliance, may, have, taken, place, between, the, indo, greeks, and, the, scythians, although, the, indo, scythians, clearly, ruled, militarily, and, politically, they, remained, surprisingly, respectful, of, greek, and, indian, cultures, their, coins, were, minted, in, greek, mints, continued, using, proper, greek, and, kharoshthi, legends, and, incorporated, depictions, of, greek, deities, particularly, zeus, the, mathura, lion, capital, inscription, attests, that, they, adopted, the, buddhist, faith, as, do, the, depictions, of, deities, forming, the, vitarka, mudra, on, their, coins, greek, communities, far, from, being, exterminated, probably, persisted, under, indo, scythian, rule, there, is, a, possibility, that, a, fusion, rather, than, a, confrontation, occurred, between, the, greeks, and, the, indo, scythians, in, a, recently, published, coin, artemidorus, seems, to, present, himself, as, son, of, maues, but, this, is, now, disputed, and, the, buner, reliefs, show, indo, greeks, and, indo, scythians, reveling, in, a, buddhist, context, the, last, known, mention, of, an, indo, greek, ruler, is, suggested, by, an, inscription, on, a, signet, ring, of, the, 1st, century, ad, in, the, name, of, a, king, theodamas, from, the, bajaur, area, of, gandhara, in, modern, pakistan, no, coins, of, him, are, known, but, the, signet, bears, in, kharoshthi, script, the, inscription, su, theodamasa, su, being, explained, as, the, greek, transliteration, of, the, ubiquitous, kushan, royal, title, shau, shah, king, the, indo, greek, kingdoms, lost, most, of, their, eastern, territories, in, the, 1st, century, bc, following, the, death, of, menander, the, arjunayanas, and, the, yaudheya, republic, mention, military, victories, on, their, coins, victory, of, the, arjunayanas, victory, of, the, yaudheyas, these, entities, would, remain, independent, until, being, conquered, by, the, saka, king, rudradaman, i, of, the, western, satraps, rudradaman, who, by, force, destroyed, the, yaudheyas, who, were, loath, to, submit, rendered, proud, as, they, were, by, having, manifested, their, title, of, heroes, among, all, kshatriyas, they, would, again, win, independence, until, being, conquered, by, samudragupta, 350, 375, ce, of, the, gupta, empire, and, would, disintegrate, soon, after, during, the, 1st, century, bc, the, trigartas, audumbaras, and, finally, the, kunindas, also, started, to, mint, their, own, coins, usually, in, a, style, highly, reminiscent, of, indo, greek, coinage, the, yavanas, may, have, ruled, as, far, as, the, area, of, mathura, from, the, time, of, menander, i, until, the, middle, of, the, 1st, century, bc, the, maghera, inscription, from, a, village, near, mathura, records, the, dedication, of, a, well, in, the, one, hundred, and, sixteenth, year, of, the, reign, of, the, yavanas, which, corresponds, to, circa, 70, bc, in, the, 1st, century, bc, however, they, lost, the, area, of, mathura, either, to, the, mitra, rulers, under, the, shunga, empire, or, to, the, datta, dynasty, fleeing, the, sakas, in, the, west, the, indo, greeks, continued, to, rule, a, territory, in, the, eastern, punjab, the, kingdom, of, the, last, indo, greek, kings, strato, ii, and, strato, iii, was, conquered, by, the, northern, satrap, saka, ruler, rajuvula, around, 10, ad, some, greek, nuclei, may, have, continued, to, survive, until, the, 2nd, century, ad, nahapana, had, at, his, court, a, greek, writer, named, yavanesvara, lord, of, the, greeks, who, translated, from, greek, to, sanskrit, the, yavanajataka, saying, of, the, greeks, an, astrological, treatise, and, india, s, earliest, sanskrit, work, in, horoscopy, a, large, number, of, buddhist, caves, in, india, particularly, in, the, west, of, the, country, were, artistically, hewn, between, the, 1st, century, bc, and, the, 2nd, century, ad, numerous, donors, provided, the, funds, for, the, building, of, these, caves, and, left, donatory, inscriptions, including, laity, members, of, the, clergy, government, officials, foreigners, mostly, self, declared, yavanas, represented, about, 8, of, all, inscriptions, yavanas, from, the, region, of, nashik, are, mentioned, as, donors, for, six, structural, pillars, in, the, great, buddhist, chaitya, of, the, karla, caves, built, and, dedicated, by, western, satraps, ruler, nahapana, in, 120, ad, although, they, seem, to, have, adopted, buddhist, names, in, total, the, yavanas, account, for, nearly, half, of, the, known, dedicatory, inscriptions, on, the, pillars, of, the, great, chaitya, to, this, day, nasik, is, known, as, the, wine, capital, of, india, using, grapes, that, were, probably, originally, imported, by, the, greeks, two, more, buddhist, inscriptions, by, yavanas, were, found, in, the, shivneri, caves, one, of, the, inscriptions, mentions, the, donation, of, a, tank, by, the, yavana, named, irila, while, the, other, mentions, the, gift, of, a, refectory, to, the, sangha, by, the, yavana, named, cita, on, this, second, inscription, the, buddhist, symbols, of, the, triratna, and, of, the, swastika, reversed, are, positioned, on, both, sides, of, the, first, word, yavana, sa, one, of, the, buddhist, caves, cave, no, 17, in, the, pandavleni, caves, complex, near, nashik, was, built, and, dedicated, by, indragnidatta, the, son, of, the, yavana, dharmadeva, a, northerner, from, dattamittri, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, the, city, of, dattamittri, is, thought, to, be, the, city, of, demetrias, in, arachosia, mentioned, by, isidore, of, charax, cave, no, 17, has, one, inscription, mentioning, the, gift, of, the, cave, by, indragnidatta, the, son, of, the, yavana, i, e, greek, or, indo, greek, dharmadeva, in, the, manmodi, caves, near, junnar, an, inscription, by, a, yavana, donor, appears, on, the, fa, ade, of, the, main, chaitya, on, the, central, flat, surface, of, the, lotus, over, the, entrance, it, mentions, the, erection, of, the, hall, front, fa, ade, for, the, buddhist, samgha, by, a, yavana, donor, named, chanda, yavanasa, camd, nam, gabhad, the, meritorious, gift, of, the, fa, ade, of, the, gharba, hall, by, the, yavana, chanda, these, contributions, seem, to, have, ended, when, the, satavahana, king, gautamiputra, satakarni, vanquished, the, western, satrap, ruler, nahapana, who, had, ruled, over, the, area, where, these, inscriptions, were, made, c, ad, 130, this, victory, is, known, from, the, fact, that, gautamiputra, satakarni, restruck, many, of, nahapana, s, coins, and, that, he, is, claimed, to, have, defeated, a, confederacy, of, shakas, western, kshatrapas, pahlavas, indo, parthians, and, yavanas, indo, greeks, in, the, inscription, of, his, mother, queen, gotami, balasiri, at, cave, no, 3, of, the, nasik, caves, siri, satakani, gotamiputa, who, crushed, down, the, pride, and, conceit, of, the, kshatriyas, who, destroyed, the, sakas, yavanas, and, palhavas, who, rooted, out, the, khakharata, race, who, restored, the, glory, of, the, satavahana, family, inscriptions, of, the, 3rd, century, ad, 210, 325, at, the, nagarjunakonda, buddhist, complex, in, southern, india, again, mention, the, involvement, of, the, yavanas, with, buddhism, an, inscription, in, a, monastery, site, no, 38, describes, its, residents, as, acaryas, and, theriyas, of, the, vibhajyavada, school, who, had, gladdened, the, heart, of, the, people, of, kasmira, gamdhara, yavana, vanavasa, and, tambapamnidipa, several, gandhara, buddha, statues, with, dated, inscriptions, are, now, thought, to, have, been, dated, in, the, yavana, era, originating, c, 186, bc, one, of, the, statues, of, the, buddha, from, loriyan, tangai, has, an, inscription, mentioning, the, year, 318, the, era, in, question, is, not, specified, but, it, is, now, thought, following, the, discovery, of, the, bajaur, reliquary, inscription, and, a, suggestion, by, richard, salomon, which, has, gained, wide, acceptance, that, it, is, dated, in, the, yavana, era, beginning, in, 186, bc, and, gives, a, date, for, the, buddha, statue, of, c, ad, 143, the, inscription, at, the, base, of, the, statue, is, sa, 1, 1, 1, 100, 10, 4, 4, prothavadasa, di, 20, 4, 1, 1, 1, budhagosa, danamu, khe, saghorumasa, sadaviyasa, in, year, 318, the, day, 27, of, prausthapada, gift, of, buddhaghosa, the, companion, of, samghavarma, this, would, make, it, one, of, the, earliest, known, representations, of, the, buddha, after, the, bimaran, casket, 1st, century, ad, and, at, about, the, same, time, as, the, buddhist, coins, of, kanishka, another, statue, of, buddha, the, buddha, of, hashtnagar, is, inscribed, from, the, year, 384, also, probably, in, the, yavana, era, which, is, thought, to, be, ad, 209, only, the, pedestal, is, preserved, in, the, british, museum, the, statue, itself, with, folds, of, clothing, having, more, relief, than, those, of, the, loriyan, tangai, buddha, having, disappeared, buddhism, flourished, under, the, indo, greek, kings, and, their, rule, especially, that, of, menander, has, been, remembered, as, benevolent, it, has, been, suggested, although, direct, evidence, is, lacking, that, their, invasion, of, india, was, intended, to, show, their, support, for, the, mauryan, empire, with, which, they, may, have, had, a, long, history, of, marital, alliances, exchange, of, presents, demonstrations, of, friendship, exchange, of, ambassadors, and, religious, missions, the, historian, diodorus, even, wrote, that, the, king, of, pataliputra, had, great, love, for, the, greeks, the, greek, expansion, into, indian, territory, may, have, been, intended, to, protect, greek, populations, in, india, and, to, protect, the, buddhist, faith, from, the, religious, persecutions, of, the, shungas, the, city, of, sirkap, founded, by, demetrius, combines, greek, and, indian, influences, without, signs, of, segregation, between, the, two, cultures, the, first, greek, coins, to, be, minted, in, india, those, of, menander, i, and, apollodotus, i, bear, the, mention, saviour, king, a, title, with, high, value, in, the, greek, world, which, indicated, an, important, deflective, victory, for, instance, ptolemy, i, had, been, soter, saviour, because, he, had, helped, save, rhodes, from, demetrius, the, besieger, and, antiochus, i, because, he, had, saved, asia, minor, from, the, gauls, the, title, was, also, inscribed, in, pali, as, tratarasa, on, the, reverse, of, their, coins, menander, and, apollodotus, may, indeed, have, been, saviours, to, the, greek, populations, residing, in, india, and, to, some, of, the, indians, as, well, also, most, of, the, coins, of, the, greek, kings, in, india, were, bilingual, written, in, greek, on, the, front, and, in, pali, on, the, back, in, the, kharosthi, script, derived, from, aramaic, rather, than, the, more, eastern, brahmi, which, was, used, only, once, on, coins, of,

pushyamitra, shunga, the, former, senapati, or, army, lord, of, the, mauryan, empire, and, founder, of, the, shunga, empire, pushyamitra, is, alleged, to, have, persecuted, buddhism, in, favor, of, hinduism, likely, in, attempt, to, further, remove, the, legacy, of, the, mauryan, empire, pushyamitra, equipped, a, fourfold, army, and, intending, to, destroy, the, buddhist, religion, he, went, to, the, kukkutarama, in, pataliputra, pushyamitra, therefore, destroyed, the, sangharama, killed, the, monks, there, and, departed, after, some, time, he, arrived, in, sakala, and, proclaimed, that, he, would, give, a, reward, to, whoever, brought, him, the, head, of, a, buddhist, monk, it, is, possible, that, menander, i, soter, or, the, saviour, king, choose, sakala, as, his, capital, due, to, the, buddhist, presence, there, menander, i, is, stated, to, have, converted, to, buddhism, in, the, milinda, panha, which, records, the, dialogue, between, menander, and, the, buddhist, monk, nagasena, menander, is, claimed, to, have, obtained, the, title, of, an, arhat, and, afterwards, taking, delight, in, the, wisdom, of, the, elder, he, menander, handed, over, his, kingdom, to, his, son, and, abandoning, the, household, life, for, the, house, less, state, grew, great, in, insight, and, himself, attained, to, arahatship, the, wheel, he, represented, on, some, of, his, coins, was, most, likely, buddhist, dharmachakra, another, indian, text, the, stupavadana, of, ksemendra, mentions, in, the, form, of, a, prophecy, that, menander, will, build, a, stupa, in, pataliputra, plutarch, also, presents, menander, as, an, example, of, benevolent, rule, and, explains, that, upon, his, death, the, honour, of, sharing, his, remains, was, claimed, by, the, various, cities, under, his, rule, and, they, were, enshrined, in, monuments, probably, stupas, in, a, parallel, with, the, historic, buddha, but, when, one, menander, who, had, reigned, graciously, over, the, bactrians, died, afterwards, in, the, camp, the, cities, indeed, by, common, consent, celebrated, his, funerals, but, coming, to, a, contest, about, his, relics, they, were, difficultly, at, last, brought, to, this, agreement, that, his, ashes, being, distributed, everyone, should, carry, away, an, equal, share, and, they, should, all, erect, monuments, to, him, the, butkara, stupa, was, monumentalized, by, the, addition, of, hellenistic, architectural, decorations, during, indo, greek, rule, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, a, coin, of, menander, i, was, found, in, the, second, oldest, stratum, gst, 2, of, the, butkara, stupa, suggesting, a, period, of, additional, constructions, during, the, reign, of, menander, it, is, thought, that, menander, was, the, builder, of, the, second, oldest, layer, of, the, butkara, stupa, following, its, initial, construction, during, the, mauryan, empire, several, indo, greek, kings, use, the, title, dharmikasa, i, e, follower, of, the, dharma, in, the, kharoshti, script, on, the, obverse, of, their, coins, the, corresponding, legend, in, greek, is, dikaios, the, just, a, rather, usual, attribute, on, greek, coins, the, expression, follower, of, the, dharma, would, of, course, resonate, strongly, with, indian, subjects, used, to, this, expression, being, employed, by, pious, kings, especially, since, the, time, of, ashoka, who, advocated, the, dharma, in, his, inscriptions, the, seven, kings, using, dharmakasa, i, e, follower, of, the, dharma, are, late, indo, greek, kings, from, around, 150, bc, right, after, the, reign, of, menander, i, and, mainly, associated, with, the, area, of, gandhara, zoilos, i, 130, 120, bc, strato, 130, 110, bc, heliokles, ii, 95, 80, bc, theophilos, 130, or, 90, bc, menander, ii, 90, 85, bc, archebios, 90, 80, bc, and, peukolaos, c, 90, bc, the, attribute, of, dharmika, was, again, used, a, century, later, by, a, known, buddhist, practitioner, indo, scythian, king, kharahostes, to, extoll, on, his, coins, the, virtues, of, his, predecessor, king, azes, from, the, time, of, agathokleia, and, strato, i, circa, 100, bc, kings, and, divinities, are, regularly, show, on, coins, making, blessing, gestures, which, often, seem, similar, to, the, buddhist, vitarka, mudra, as, centuries, passed, the, exact, shapes, taken, by, the, hand, becomes, less, clear, this, blessing, gesture, was, also, often, adopted, by, the, indo, scythians, the, heliodorus, pillar, is, a, stone, column, that, was, erected, around, 113, bc, in, central, india, in, vidisha, near, modern, besnagar, by, heliodorus, a, greek, ambassador, of, the, indo, greek, king, antialcidas, to, the, court, of, the, shunga, king, bhagabhadra, the, pillar, originally, supported, a, statue, of, garuda, in, the, dedication, the, indo, greek, ambassador, explains, he, is, a, devotee, of, v, sudeva, the, god, of, gods, historically, it, is, the, first, known, inscription, related, to, the, bhagavata, cult, in, india, in, general, the, art, of, the, indo, greeks, is, poorly, documented, and, few, works, of, art, apart, from, their, coins, and, a, few, stone, palettes, are, directly, attributed, to, them, the, coinage, of, the, indo, greeks, however, is, generally, considered, some, of, the, most, artistically, brilliant, of, antiquity, the, hellenistic, heritage, ai, khanoum, and, artistic, proficiency, of, the, indo, greek, world, would, suggest, a, rich, sculptural, tradition, as, well, but, traditionally, very, few, sculptural, remains, have, been, attributed, to, them, on, the, contrary, most, gandharan, hellenistic, works, of, art, are, usually, attributed, to, the, direct, successors, of, the, indo, greeks, in, india, in, the, 1st, century, ad, such, as, the, nomadic, indo, scythians, the, indo, parthians, and, in, an, already, decadent, state, the, kushans, in, general, gandharan, sculpture, cannot, be, dated, exactly, leaving, the, exact, chronology, open, to, interpretation, the, possibility, of, a, direct, connection, between, the, indo, greeks, and, greco, buddhist, art, has, been, reaffirmed, recently, as, the, dating, of, the, rule, of, indo, greek, kings, has, been, extended, to, the, first, decades, of, the, 1st, century, ad, with, the, reign, of, strato, ii, in, the, punjab, also, foucher, tarn, and, more, recently, boardman, bussagli, and, mcevilley, have, taken, the, view, that, some, of, the, most, purely, hellenistic, works, of, northwestern, india, and, afghanistan, may, actually, be, wrongly, attributed, to, later, centuries, and, instead, belong, to, a, period, one, or, two, centuries, earlier, to, the, time, of, the, indo, greeks, in, the, 2nd, 1st, century, bc, this, is, particularly, the, case, of, some, purely, hellenistic, works, in, hadda, afghanistan, an, area, which, might, indeed, be, the, cradle, of, incipient, buddhist, sculpture, in, indo, greek, style, referring, to, one, of, the, buddha, triads, in, hadda, in, which, the, buddha, is, sided, by, very, classical, depictions, of, herakles, vajrapani, and, tyche, hariti, boardman, explains, that, both, figures, might, at, first, and, even, second, glance, pass, as, say, from, asia, minor, or, syria, of, the, first, or, second, century, bc, these, are, essentially, greek, figures, executed, by, artists, fully, conversant, with, far, more, than, the, externals, of, the, classical, style, alternatively, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, works, of, art, may, have, been, executed, by, itinerant, greek, artists, during, the, time, of, maritime, contacts, with, the, west, from, the, 1st, to, the, 3rd, century, ad, the, greco, buddhist, art, of, gandhara, beyond, the, omnipresence, of, greek, style, and, stylistic, elements, which, might, be, simply, considered, an, enduring, artistic, tradition, offers, numerous, depictions, of, people, in, greek, classical, realistic, style, attitudes, and, fashion, clothes, such, as, the, chiton, and, the, himation, similar, in, form, and, style, to, the, 2nd, century, bc, greco, bactrian, statues, of, ai, khanoum, hairstyle, holding, contraptions, which, are, characteristic, of, greek, culture, amphoras, kantaros, greek, drinking, cups, in, situations, which, can, range, from, festive, such, as, bacchanalian, scenes, to, buddhist, devotional, uncertainties, in, dating, make, it, unclear, whether, these, works, of, art, actually, depict, greeks, of, the, period, of, indo, greek, rule, up, to, the, 1st, century, bc, or, remaining, greek, communities, under, the, rule, of, the, indo, parthians, or, kushans, in, the, 1st, and, 2nd, century, ad, benjamin, rowland, thinks, that, the, indo, greeks, rather, than, the, indo, scythians, or, the, kushans, may, have, been, the, models, for, the, bodhisattva, statues, of, gandhara, very, little, is, known, about, the, economy, of, the, indo, greeks, although, it, seems, to, have, been, rather, vibrant, the, abundance, of, their, coins, would, tend, to, suggest, large, mining, operations, particularly, in, the, mountainous, area, of, the, hindu, kush, and, an, important, monetary, economy, the, indo, greek, did, strike, bilingual, coins, both, in, the, greek, round, standard, and, in, the, indian, square, standard, suggesting, that, monetary, circulation, extended, to, all, parts, of, society, the, adoption, of, indo, greek, monetary, conventions, by, neighbouring, kingdoms, such, as, the, kunindas, to, the, east, and, the, satavahanas, to, the, south, would, also, suggest, that, indo, greek, coins, were, used, extensively, for, cross, border, trade, it, would, also, seem, that, some, of, the, coins, emitted, by, the, indo, greek, kings, particularly, those, in, the, monolingual, attic, standard, may, have, been, used, to, pay, some, form, of, tribute, to, the, yuezhi, tribes, north, of, the, hindu, kush, this, is, indicated, by, the, coins, finds, of, the, qunduz, hoard, in, northern, afghanistan, which, have, yielded, quantities, of, indo, greek, coins, in, the, hellenistic, standard, greek, weights, greek, language, although, none, of, the, kings, represented, in, the, hoard, are, known, to, have, ruled, so, far, north, conversely, none, of, these, coins, have, ever, been, found, south, of, the, hindu, kush, the, indo, greek, kings, in, southern, asia, issued, the, first, known, cupro, nickel, coins, with, euthydemus, ii, dating, from, 180, to, 170, bc, and, his, younger, brothers, pantaleon, and, agathocles, around, 170, bc, as, only, china, was, able, to, produce, cupro, nickel, at, that, time, and, as, the, alloy, ratios, are, exclusively, similar, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, metal, was, the, result, of, exchanges, between, china, and, bactria, an, indirect, testimony, by, the, chinese, explorer, zhang, qian, who, visited, bactria, around, 128, bc, suggests, that, intense, trade, with, southern, china, was, going, through, northern, india, zhang, qian, explains, that, he, found, chinese, products, in, the, bactrian, markets, and, that, they, were, transiting, through, northwestern, india, which, he, incidentally, describes, as, a, civilization, similar, to, that, of, bactria, when, i, was, in, bactria, zhang, qian, reported, i, saw, bamboo, canes, from, qiong, and, cloth, silk, made, in, the, province, of, shu, when, i, asked, the, people, how, they, had, gotten, such, articles, they, replied, our, merchants, go, buy, them, in, the, markets, of, shendu, northwestern, india, shendu, they, told, me, lies, several, thousand, li, southeast, of, bactria, the, people, cultivate, land, and, live, much, like, the, people, of, bactria, recent, excavations, at, the, burial, site, of, china, s, first, emperor, qin, shi, huang, dating, back, to, the, 3rd, century, bce, also, suggest, greek, influence, in, the, artworks, found, there, including, in, the, manufacture, of, the, famous, terracotta, army, it, is, also, suggested, that, greek, artists, may, have, come, to, china, at, that, time, to, train, local, artisans, in, making, sculptures, maritime, relations, across, the, indian, ocean, started, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, further, developed, during, the, time, of, the, indo, greeks, together, with, their, territorial, expansion, along, the, western, coast, of, india, the, first, contacts, started, when, the, ptolemies, constructed, the, red, sea, ports, of, myos, hormos, and, berenike, with, destination, the, indus, delta, the, kathiawar, peninsula, or, muziris, around, 130, bc, eudoxus, of, cyzicus, is, reported, strabo, geog, ii, 3, 4, to, have, made, a, successful, voyage, to, india, and, returned, with, a, cargo, of, perfumes, and, gemstones, by, the, time, indo, greek, rule, was, ending, up, to, 120, ships, were, setting, sail, every, year, from, myos, hormos, to, india, strabo, geog, ii, 5, 12, the, coins, of, the, indo, greeks, provide, rich, clues, on, their, uniforms, and, weapons, typical, hellenistic, uniforms, are, depicted, with, helmets, being, either, round, in, the, greco, bactrian, style, or, the, flat, kausia, of, the, macedonians, coins, of, apollodotus, i, their, weapons, were, spears, swords, longbow, on, the, coins, of, agathokleia, and, arrows, around, 130, bc, the, central, asian, recurve, bow, of, the, steppes, with, its, gorytos, box, started, to, appear, for, the, first, time, on, the, coins, of, zoilos, i, suggesting, strong, interactions, and, apparently, an, alliance, with, nomadic, peoples, either, the, yuezhi, or, the, scythians, the, recurve, bow, becomes, a, standard, feature, of, indo, greek, horsemen, by, 90, bc, as, seen, on, some, of, the, coins, of, hermaeus, generally, indo, greek, kings, are, often, represented, riding, horses, as, early, as, the, reign, of, antimachus, ii, around, 160, bc, the, equestrian, tradition, probably, goes, back, to, the, greco, bactrians, who, are, said, by, polybius, to, have, faced, a, seleucid, invasion, in, 210, bc, with, 10, 000, horsemen, although, war, elephants, are, never, represented, on, coins, a, harness, plate, phalera, dated, to, the, 3rd, 2nd, century, bc, today, in, the, hermitage, museum, depicts, a, helmetted, greek, combatant, on, an, indian, war, elephant, the, milinda, panha, in, the, questions, of, nagasena, to, king, menander, provides, a, rare, glimpse, of, the, military, methods, of, the, period, nagasena, has, it, ever, happened, to, you, o, king, that, rival, kings, rose, up, against, you, as, enemies, and, opponents, menander, yes, certainly, then, you, set, to, work, i, suppose, to, have, moats, dug, and, ramparts, thrown, up, and, watch, towers, erected, and, strongholds, built, and, stores, of, food, collected, not, at, all, all, that, had, been, prepared, beforehand, or, you, had, yourself, trained, in, the, management, of, war, elephants, and, in, horsemanship, and, in, the, use, of, the, war, chariot, and, in, archery, and, fencing, not, at, all, i, had, learnt, all, that, before, but, why, with, the, object, of, warding, off, future, danger, the, milinda, panha, also, describes, the, structure, of, menander, s, army, now, one, day, milinda, the, king, proceeded, forth, out, of, the, city, to, pass, in, review, the, innumerable, host, of, his, mighty, army, in, its, fourfold, array, of, elephants, cavalry, bowmen, and, soldiers, on, foot, the, armed, forces, of, the, indo, greeks, engaged, in, battles, with, other, indian, kingdoms, the, ruler, of, kalinga, king, kharavela, states, in, the, hathigumpha, inscription, that, during, the, 8th, year, of, his, reign, he, led, a, large, army, in, the, direction, of, a, yavana, king, and, that, he, forced, their, demoralized, army, to, retreat, to, mathura, then, in, the, eighth, year, kharavela, with, a, large, army, having, sacked, goradhagiri, causes, pressure, on, rajagaha, rajagriha, on, account, of, the, loud, report, of, this, act, of, valour, the, yavana, greek, king, dimi, retreated, to, mathura, having, extricated, his, demoralized, army, the, name, of, the, yavana, king, is, not, clear, but, it, contains, three, letters, and, the, middle, letter, can, be, read, as, ma, or, mi, r, d, banerji, and, k, p, jayaswal, read, the, name, of, the, yavana, king, as, dimita, and, identify, him, with, demetrius, i, of, bactria, however, according, to, ramaprasad, chanda, this, identification, results, in, chronological, impossibilities, the, greek, ambassador, megasthenes, took, special, note, of, the, military, strength, of, kalinga, in, his, indica, in, the, middle, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, royal, city, of, the, calingae, kalinga, is, called, parthalis, over, their, king, 60, 000, foot, soldiers, 1, 000, horsemen, 700, elephants, keep, watch, and, ward, in, procinct, of, war, an, account, by, the, roman, writer, justin, gives, another, hint, of, the, size, of, indo, greek, armies, which, in, the, case, of, the, conflict, between, the, greco, bactrian, eucratides, and, the, indo, greek, demetrius, ii, he, numbers, at, 60, 000, although, they, allegedly, lost, to, 300, greco, bactrians, eucratides, led, many, wars, with, great, courage, and, while, weakened, by, them, was, put, under, siege, by, demetrius, king, of, the, indians, he, made, numerous, sorties, and, managed, to, vanquish, 60, 000, enemies, with, 300, soldiers, and, thus, liberated, after, four, months, he, put, india, under, his, rule, the, indo, greek, armies, would, be, conquered, by, indo, scythians, a, nomadic, tribe, from, central, asia, from, the, 1st, century, ad, the, greek, communities, of, central, asia, and, the, northwestern, indian, subcontinent, lived, under, the, control, of, the, kushan, branch, of, the, yuezhi, apart, from, a, short, lived, invasion, of, the, indo, parthian, kingdom, the, kushans, founded, the, kushan, empire, which, was, to, prosper, for, several, centuries, in, the, south, the, greeks, were, under, the, rule, of, the, western, kshatrapas, the, kalash, tribe, of, the, chitral, valley, claim, to, be, descendants, of, the, indo, greeks, although, this, is, disputed, it, is, unclear, how, much, longer, the, greeks, managed, to, maintain, a, distinct, presence, in, the, indian, sub, continent, the, legacy, of, the, indo, greeks, was, felt, however, for, several, centuries, from, the, usage, of, the, greek, language, and, calendrical, methods, to, the, influences, on, the, numismatics, of, the, indian, subcontinent, traceable, down, to, the, period, of, the, gupta, empire, in, the, 4th, century, the, greeks, may, also, have, maintained, a, presence, in, their, cities, until, quite, late, isidorus, of, charax, in, his, 1st, century, ad, parthian, stations, itinerary, described, an, alexandropolis, the, metropolis, of, arachosia, thought, to, be, alexandria, arachosia, which, he, said, was, still, greek, even, at, such, a, late, time, beyond, is, arachosia, and, the, parthians, call, this, white, india, there, are, the, city, of, biyt, and, the, city, of, pharsana, and, the, city, of, chorochoad, and, the, city, of, demetrias, then, alexandropolis, the, metropolis, of, arachosia, it, is, greek, and, by, it, flows, the, river, arachotus, as, far, as, this, place, the, land, is, under, the, rule, of, the, parthians, the, indo, greeks, may, also, have, had, some, influence, on, the, religious, plane, as, well, especially, in, relation, to, the, developing, mahayana, buddhism, mahayana, buddhism, has, been, described, as, the, form, of, buddhism, which, regardless, of, how, hinduized, its, later, forms, became, seems, to, have, originated, in, the, greco, buddhist, communities, of, india, through, a, conflation, of, the, greek, democritean, sophistic, pyrrhonist, tradition, with, the, rudimentary, and, unformalized, empirical, and, skeptical, elements, already, present, in, early, buddhism, today, 36, indo, greek, kings, are, known, several, of, them, are, also, recorded, in, western, and, indian, historical, sources, but, the, majority, are, known, through, numismatic, evidence, only, the, exact, chronology, and, sequencing, of, their, rule, is, still, a, matter, of, scholarly, inquiry, with, adjustments, regular, being, made, with, new, analysis, and, coin, finds, overstrikes, of, one, king, over, another, s, coins, being, the, most, critical, element, in, establishing, chronological, sequences, there, is, an, important, evolution, of, coin, shape, round, to, square, and, material, from, gold, to, silver, to, brass, across, the, territories, and, the, periods, and, from, greek, type, to, indian, type, over, a, period, of, nearly, 3, centuries, also, the, quality, of, coinage, illustration, decreases, down, to, the, 1st, century, ad, coinage, evolution, is, an, important, point, of, indo, greek, history, and, actually, one, of, the, most, important, since, most, of, these, kings, are, only, known, by, their, coins, and, their, chronology, is, mainly, established, by, the, evolution, of, the, coin, types, the, system, used, here, is, adapted, from, osmund, bopearachchi, supplemented, by, the, views, of, r, c, senior, and, occasionally, other, authorities, indo, scythians, indo, parthians, references, sources
