indigenous, allies, aztec, commanders, spaniards, total, 1, 800, spaniards, dead, 200, 000, aztecs, dead, including, civilians, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, was, a, pivotal, event, in, the, history, of, the, americas, marked, by, the, collision, of, the, aztec, triple, alliance, and, the, spanish, empire, ultimately, reshaping, the, course, of, human, history, taking, place, between, 1519, and, 1521, this, event, saw, the, spanish, conquistador, hern, n, cort, s, and, his, small, army, of, european, soldiers, and, numerous, indigenous, allies, overthrowing, one, of, the, most, powerful, empires, in, mesoamerica, led, by, the, aztec, ruler, moctezuma, ii, the, aztec, empire, had, established, dominance, over, central, mexico, through, military, conquest, and, intricate, alliances, because, the, aztec, empire, ruled, via, hegemonic, control, by, maintaining, local, leadership, and, relying, on, the, psychological, perception, of, aztec, power, backed, by, military, force, the, aztecs, normally, kept, subordinate, rulers, compliant, this, was, an, inherently, unstable, system, of, governance, as, this, situation, could, change, with, any, alteration, in, the, status, quo, a, combination, of, factors, including, superior, weaponry, strategic, alliances, with, oppressed, or, otherwise, dissatisfied, or, opportunistic, indigenous, groups, and, the, impact, of, european, diseases, contributed, to, the, downfall, of, the, short, rule, of, the, aztec, civilization, the, invasion, of, tenochtitl, n, the, capital, of, the, aztec, empire, marked, the, beginning, of, spanish, dominance, in, the, region, and, the, establishment, of, new, spain, this, conquest, had, profound, consequences, as, it, led, to, the, cultural, assimilation, of, the, spanish, culture, while, also, paving, the, way, for, the, emergence, of, a, new, social, hierarchy, dominated, by, spanish, conquerors, and, their, descendants, following, an, earlier, expedition, to, yucat, n, led, by, juan, de, grijalva, in, 1518, spanish, conquistador, hern, ndo, cort, s, led, an, expedition, entrada, to, mexico, the, next, year, cort, s, and, his, retinue, set, sail, for, mexico, the, spanish, campaign, against, the, aztec, empire, had, its, final, victory, on, 13, august, 1521, when, a, coalition, army, of, spanish, forces, and, native, tlaxcalan, warriors, led, by, cort, s, and, xicotencatl, the, younger, captured, the, emperor, cuauht, moc, and, tenochtitlan, the, capital, of, the, aztec, empire, the, fall, of, tenochtitlan, marks, the, beginning, of, spanish, rule, in, central, mexico, and, they, established, their, capital, of, mexico, city, on, the, ruins, of, tenochtitlan, cort, s, made, alliances, with, tributary, city, states, altepetl, of, the, aztec, empire, as, well, as, their, political, rivals, particularly, the, tlaxcaltecs, and, tetzcocans, a, former, partner, in, the, aztec, triple, alliance, other, city, states, also, joined, including, cempoala, and, huejotzingo, and, polities, bordering, lake, texcoco, the, inland, lake, system, of, the, valley, of, mexico, particularly, important, to, the, spanish, success, was, a, multilingual, nahuatl, a, maya, dialect, and, spanish, nahua, speaking, woman, enslaved, by, the, mayas, known, to, the, spanish, conquistadors, as, do, a, marina, and, later, as, la, malinche, after, eight, months, of, battles, and, negotiations, which, overcame, the, diplomatic, resistance, of, the, aztec, emperor, moctezuma, ii, to, his, visit, cort, s, arrived, in, tenochtitlan, on, 8, november, 1519, where, he, took, up, residence, with, fellow, spaniards, and, their, indigenous, allies, when, news, reached, cort, s, of, the, death, of, several, of, his, men, during, the, aztec, attack, on, the, totonacs, in, veracruz, cort, s, claims, that, he, took, motecuhzoma, captive, capturing, the, cacique, or, indigenous, ruler, was, a, standard, operating, procedure, for, spaniards, in, their, expansion, in, the, caribbean, so, capturing, motecuhzoma, had, considerable, precedent, but, modern, scholars, are, skeptical, that, cort, s, and, his, countrymen, took, motecuhzoma, captive, at, this, time, they, had, great, incentive, to, claim, they, did, owing, to, the, laws, of, spain, at, this, time, but, critical, analysis, of, their, personal, writings, suggest, motecuhzoma, was, not, taken, captive, until, a, much, later, date, when, cort, s, left, tenochtitlan, to, return, to, the, coast, and, deal, with, the, threat, of, the, expedition, of, p, nfilo, de, narv, ez, cort, s, left, pedro, de, alvarado, in, charge, of, tenochtitlan, cort, s, left, with, a, small, army, to, the, coast, with, the, plan, of, attacking, during, the, night, after, defeating, narv, ez, s, fleet, cort, s, convinced, most, of, his, enemy, s, crew, to, go, with, him, by, promising, great, riches, upon, reaching, tenochtitlan, cort, s, and, the, new, enlarged, force, received, the, message, that, the, aztec, had, risen, against, the, spanish, garrison, during, a, religious, celebration, alvarado, ordered, his, army, to, attack, the, unarmed, crowd, he, later, claims, that, the, aztecs, had, used, the, celebration, to, cover, up, a, counterattack, cort, s, realized, that, the, defeat, was, imminent, and, decided, to, escape, yet, the, aztecs, attacked, the, massacre, is, most, known, as, la, noche, triste, the, sorrowful, night, about, 400, spaniards, 4000, native, allies, and, many, horses, before, reaching, the, mainland, moctezuma, was, killed, although, the, sources, do, not, agree, on, who, killed, him, according, to, one, account, when, moctezuma, now, seen, by, the, population, as, a, mere, puppet, of, the, invading, spaniards, attempted, to, calm, the, outraged, populace, he, was, killed, by, a, projectile, according, to, an, indigenous, account, the, spanish, killed, moctezuma, the, spanish, tlaxcalans, and, reinforcements, returned, a, year, later, on, 13, august, 1521, to, a, civilization, that, had, been, weakened, by, famine, and, smallpox, this, made, it, easier, to, conquer, the, remaining, aztecs, the, spaniards, victory, is, attributed, to, their, help, from, indigenous, allies, technology, and, the, aztec, empire, s, vulnerability, due, to, the, smallpox, spread, as, a, result, the, aztec, s, tactics, countering, the, spaniard, s, advanced, technology, is, understated, according, to, hassig, it, is, true, that, cannons, guns, crossbows, steel, blades, horses, and, war, dogs, were, advanced, on, the, aztecs, weaponry, but, the, advantage, these, gave, a, few, hundred, spanish, soldiers, was, not, overwhelming, in, the, words, of, restall, spanish, weapons, were, useful, for, breaking, the, offensive, lines, of, waves, of, indigenous, warriors, but, this, was, no, formula, for, conquest, rather, it, was, a, formula, for, survival, until, spanish, and, indigenous, reinforcements, arrived, the, integration, of, the, indigenous, allies, essentially, those, from, tlaxcala, and, texcoco, into, the, spanish, army, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, conquest, yet, other, factors, paved, the, path, for, the, spaniards, success, for, instance, the, spaniards, timing, of, entry, the, compelling, ideologies, of, both, groups, and, the, spanish, unfamiliarity, with, the, aztec, empire, therefore, the, spaniards, lacked, a, sense, of, danger, and, power, structure, within, the, empire, a, direct, attack, on, a, city, as, mighty, as, tenochtitlan, was, unlikely, and, unexpected, from, the, enemy, empires, as, well, it, was, very, uncommon, that, an, attacking, army, would, come, unannounced, in, addition, aside, from, the, infantry, and, the, allies, role, in, the, spanish, conquest, cavalry, was, the, arm, of, decision, in, the, conquest, and, the, key, ingredient, in, the, spanish, forces, many, of, those, on, the, cort, s, expedition, of, 1519, had, never, seen, combat, before, including, cort, s, a, whole, generation, of, spaniards, later, participated, in, expeditions, in, the, caribbean, and, tierra, firme, central, america, learning, strategy, and, tactics, of, successful, enterprises, the, spanish, conquest, of, mexico, had, antecedents, with, established, practices, the, fall, of, the, aztec, empire, was, the, key, event, in, the, formation, of, the, spanish, empire, overseas, with, new, spain, which, later, became, mexico, 1519, 1520, 1521, 1522, 1524, 1525, 1525, 30, 1527, 1547, the, conquest, of, mexico, the, initial, destruction, of, the, great, pre, columbian, civilizations, is, a, significant, event, in, world, history, the, conquest, was, well, documented, by, a, variety, of, sources, with, differing, points, of, view, including, indigenous, accounts, by, both, allies, and, opponents, accounts, by, the, spanish, conquerors, exist, from, the, first, landfall, at, veracruz, mexico, on, good, friday, 22, april, 1519, to, the, final, victory, over, the, mexica, in, tenochtitlan, on, 13, august, 1521, notably, the, accounts, of, the, conquest, spanish, and, indigenous, alike, have, biases, and, exaggerations, some, though, not, all, spanish, accounts, downplay, the, support, of, their, indigenous, allies, conquerors, accounts, exaggerate, individual, contributions, to, the, conquest, at, the, expense, of, their, comrades, while, indigenous, allies, accounts, stress, their, loyalty, and, importance, to, victory, for, the, spanish, these, accounts, are, similar, to, spanish, conquerors, accounts, contained, in, petitions, for, rewards, known, as, benem, rito, petitions, two, lengthy, accounts, from, the, defeated, indigenous, viewpoint, were, created, under, the, direction, of, spanish, friars, franciscan, bernardino, de, sahag, n, and, dominican, diego, dur, n, using, indigenous, informants, because, nahuatl, did, not, have, a, full, alphabet, the, majority, of, extant, indigenous, sources, are, recollections, of, nahuatl, speakers, who, were, subsequently, introduced, to, latin, characters, after, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, gingerish, identifies, the, annals, of, tlatelolco, 1524, 1528, as, one, of, the, oldest, recorded, manuscripts, in, nahuatl, written, presumably, by, a, native, who, must, have, learned, the, use, of, latin, characters, and, alphabet, within, three, or, four, years, of, the, conquest, lockhart, however, argues, for, a, later, post, 1540, date, for, this, manuscript, and, indeed, the, majority, of, indigenous, source, material, was, recorded, a, generation, or, more, after, the, events, through, interaction, with, and, under, influence, of, spanish, priests, as, noted, in, no, pure, nahuatl, text, exists, with, the, exception, of, a, few, pre, cortesian, pictographic, codices, every, written, nahuatl, text, was, recorded, after, 1521, either, directly, by, a, christian, priest, by, students, who, worked, directly, under, priestly, supervision, or, by, former, students, who, had, studied, in, christian, schools, long, enough, to, understand, the, necessity, of, the, new, religion, the, written, language, was, a, personal, possession, of, the, noble, and, priestly, class, the, first, spanish, account, of, the, conquest, was, written, by, lead, conqueror, hern, n, cort, s, who, sent, a, series, of, letters, to, the, spanish, monarch, charles, v, giving, a, contemporary, account, of, the, conquest, from, his, point, of, view, in, which, he, justified, his, actions, these, were, almost, immediately, published, in, spain, and, later, in, other, parts, of, europe, much, later, spanish, conqueror, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, a, well, seasoned, participant, in, the, conquest, of, central, mexico, wrote, what, he, called, the, true, history, of, the, conquest, of, new, spain, countering, the, account, by, cort, s, s, official, biographer, francisco, l, pez, de, g, mara, bernal, d, az, s, account, had, begun, as, a, benem, rito, petition, for, rewards, but, he, expanded, it, to, encompass, a, full, history, of, his, earlier, expeditions, in, the, caribbean, and, tierra, firme, and, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, a, number, of, lower, rank, spanish, conquerors, wrote, benem, rito, petitions, to, the, spanish, crown, requesting, rewards, for, their, services, in, the, conquest, including, juan, d, az, andr, s, de, tapia, garc, a, del, pilar, and, fray, francisco, de, aguilar, cort, s, s, right, hand, man, pedro, de, alvarado, did, not, write, at, any, length, about, his, actions, in, the, new, world, and, died, as, a, man, of, action, in, the, mixt, n, war, in, 1542, two, letters, to, cort, s, about, alvarado, s, campaigns, in, guatemala, are, published, in, the, conquistadors, the, chronicle, of, the, so, called, anonymous, conqueror, was, written, sometime, in, the, sixteenth, century, entitled, in, an, early, twentieth, century, translation, to, english, as, narrative, of, some, things, of, new, spain, and, of, the, great, city, of, temestitan, i, e, tenochtitlan, rather, than, it, being, a, petition, for, rewards, for, services, as, many, spanish, accounts, were, the, anonymous, conqueror, made, observations, about, the, indigenous, situation, at, the, time, of, the, conquest, the, account, was, used, by, eighteenth, century, jesuit, francisco, javier, clavijero, in, his, descriptions, of, the, history, of, mexico, on, the, indigenous, side, the, allies, of, cort, s, particularly, the, tlaxcalans, wrote, extensively, about, their, services, to, the, spanish, crown, in, the, conquest, arguing, for, special, privileges, for, themselves, the, most, important, of, these, are, the, pictorial, lienzo, de, tlaxcala, 1585, and, the, historia, de, tlaxcala, by, diego, mu, oz, camargo,

shifts, from, the, indigenous, viewpoint, entirely, and, inserts, at, crucial, junctures, passages, lauding, the, spanish, and, in, particular, hern, n, cort, s, another, indigenous, account,

although, few, had, been, published, by, the, mid, nineteenth, century, when, he, was, writing, it, is, likely, that, a, 1585, revision, of, bernardino, de, sahag, n, s, account, of, the, conquest, survives, today, only, in, the, form, of, a, copy, because, it, was, made, in, spain, for, prescott, s, project, from, a, now, lost, original, although, scholars, of, the, modern, era, point, out, its, biases, and, shortcomings, there, is, nowhere, they, can, get, as, good, a, unified, narrative, of, the, main, events, crises, and, course, of, the, mexican, conquest, as, prescott, s, version, in, the, sources, recorded, by, franciscan, bernardino, de, sahag, n, and, dominican, diego, dur, n, in, the, mid, to, late, sixteenth, century, there, are, accounts, of, events, that, were, interpreted, as, supernatural, omens, of, the, conquest, these, two, accounts, are, full, blown, narratives, from, the, viewpoint, of, the, spanish, opponents, most, first, hand, accounts, about, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, were, written, by, spaniards, hern, n, cort, s, letters, to, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, and, the, first, person, narrative, of, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, the, true, history, of, the, conquest, of, new, spain, the, primary, sources, from, the, native, people, affected, as, a, result, of, the, conquest, are, seldom, used, because, they, tend, to, reflect, the, views, of, a, particular, native, group, such, as, the, tlaxcalans, indigenous, accounts, were, written, in, pictographs, as, early, as, 1525, later, accounts, were, written, in, the, native, tongue, of, the, aztec, and, other, native, peoples, of, central, mexico, nahuatl, the, native, texts, of, the, defeated, mexica, narrating, their, version, of, the, conquest, describe, eight, omens, that, were, believed, to, have, occurred, nine, years, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, from, the, gulf, of, mexico, in, 1510, aztec, emperor, moctezuma, ii, was, visited, by, nezahualpilli, who, had, a, reputation, as, a, great, seer, as, well, as, being, the, tlatoani, of, texcoco, nezahualpilli, warned, moctezuma, that, he, must, be, on, guard, for, in, a, few, years, aztec, cities, would, be, destroyed, before, leaving, he, said, that, there, would, be, omens, for, moctezuma, to, know, that, what, he, has, been, told, is, true, over, the, years, and, especially, after, nezhualpilli, s, death, in, 1515, several, supernatural, omens, appeared, the, eight, bad, omens, or, wonders, 3, 11, additionally, the, tlaxcala, saw, a, radiance, that, shone, in, the, east, every, morning, three, hours, before, sunrise, and, a, whirlwind, of, dust, from, the, volcano, matlalcueye, 11, according, to, diaz, these, caciques, also, told, us, of, a, tradition, they, had, heard, from, their, ancestors, that, one, of, the, idols, which, they, particularly, worshipped, had, prophesied, the, coming, of, men, from, distant, lands, in, the, direction, of, the, sunrise, who, would, conquer, them, and, rule, them, 181, some, accounts, would, claim, that, this, idol, or, deity, was, quetzalcoatl, and, that, the, aztecs, were, defeated, because, they, believed, the, spanish, were, supernatural, and, didn, t, know, how, to, react, although, whether, or, not, the, aztecs, really, believed, that, is, debatable, omens, were, extremely, important, to, the, aztecs, who, believed, that, history, repeated, itself, a, number, of, modern, scholars, cast, doubt, on, whether, such, omens, occurred, or, whether, they, were, ex, post, facto, retrospective, creations, to, help, the, mexica, explain, their, defeat, some, scholars, contend, that, the, most, likely, interpretation, of, the, story, of, these, portents, is, that, some, if, not, all, had, occurred, but, concede, that, it, is, very, likely, that, clever, mexicans, and, friars, writing, later, of, the, mexican, empire, were, happy, to, link, those, memories, with, what, they, know, occurred, in, europe, many, sources, depicting, omens, and, the, return, of, old, aztec, gods, including, those, supervised, by, spanish, priests, were, written, after, the, fall, of, tenochtitlan, in, 1521, spanish, accounts, tended, to, incorporate, omens, to, emphasize, what, they, saw, as, the, preordained, nature, of, the, conquest, and, their, success, as, spanish, destiny, this, influenced, some, natives, writing, under, the, tutelage, of, the, franciscan, friars, other, explanations, include, a, desire, to, please, the, spaniards, or, resentment, toward, the, failure, of, montezuma, and, tenochtitlan, warriors, hugh, thomas, writes, that, moctezuma, was, debating, whether, cort, s, was, a, god, or, the, ambassador, of, a, great, king, in, another, land, because, the, spaniards, arrived, in, 1519, moctezuma, knew, this, was, the, year, of, ce, acatl, which, is, the, year, quetzalcoatl, was, promised, to, return, previously, during, juan, de, grijalva, s, expedition, moctezuma, believed, that, those, men, were, heralds, of, quetzalcoatl, as, moctezuma, as, well, as, everyone, else, in, the, aztec, empire, were, to, believe, that, eventually, quetzalcoatl, will, return, moctezuma, even, had, glass, beads, that, were, left, behind, by, grijalva, brought, to, tenochtitlan, and, they, were, regarded, as, sacred, religious, relics, on, the, other, hand, some, ethnohistorians, say, the, aztec, leaders, did, not, view, the, spaniards, as, supernatural, in, any, sense, but, rather, as, simply, another, group, of, powerful, outsiders, they, believe, that, moctezuma, responded, rationally, to, the, spanish, invasion, and, did, not, think, the, spanish, were, supernatural, in, his, own, letters, written, on, the, spot, cort, s, never, claimed, that, he, was, perceived, as, a, god, the, idea, appears, to, emerge, only, in, the, 1540s, in, writings, by, europeans, nonetheless, it, was, repeated, in, many, sources, even, among, indians, especially, those, who, had, become, students, of, the, franciscan, friars, and, were, searching, for, an, explanation, for, how, the, aztecs, had, fallen, this, was, complicated, by, the, word, teules, that, the, nahuas, used, to, refer, to, the, spaniards, who, claimed, to, represent, their, christian, god, and, originated, from, a, land, unknown, to, the, natives, teules, is, derived, from, the, nahuatl, word, teotl, for, god, but, with, its, meaning, changed, to, representative, of, god, sometimes, implying, mysterious, and, supernatural, power, the, spanish, had, established, a, permanent, settlement, on, the, island, of, hispaniola, in, 1493, on, the, second, voyage, of, christopher, columbus, there, were, further, spanish, explorations, and, settlements, in, the, caribbean, and, the,

hern, ndez, de, c, rdoba, to, sail, west, and, explore, the, yucat, n, peninsula, c, rdoba, reached, the, coast, of, yucat, n, the, mayans, at, cape, catoche, invited, the, spanish, to, land, and, the, conquistadors, read, the, requirement, of, 1513, to, them, which, offered, the, natives, the, protection, of, the, king, of, spain, if, they, would, submit, to, him, c, rdoba, took, two, prisoners, who, adopted, the, baptized, names, of, melchor, and, juli, n, and, became, interpreters, later, the, two, prisoners, being, misled, or, misinterpreting, the, language, gave, information, to, the, spanish, conquistadors, that, there, was, plenty, of, gold, up, for, grabs, on, the, western, side, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, the, spanish, were, attacked, at, night, by, maya, chief, mochcouoh, a, battle, in, which, 50, men, were, killed, c, rdoba, was, mortally, wounded, and, only, a, remnant, of, his, crew, returned, to, cuba, 15, 26, at, that, time, yucat, n, was, briefly, explored, by, the, conquistadors, but, the, spanish, conquest, of, yucat, n, with, its, many, independent, city, state, polities, of, the, late, postclassic, maya, civilization, came, many, years, after, the, spaniards, and, their, loyal, indigenous, allies, rapid, conquest, of, central, mexico, 1519, 21, with, the, help, of, tens, of, thousands, of, xiu, mayan, warriors, it, would, take, more, than, 170, years, for, the, spanish, to, establish, full, control, of, the, maya, homelands, which, extended, from, northern, yucat, n, to, the, central, lowlands, region, of, el, pet, n, and, the, southern, guatemalan, highlands, the, end, of, this, latter, campaign, is, generally, marked, by, the, downfall, of, the, maya, state, based, at, tayasal, in, the, pet, n, region, in, 1697, even, before, juan, de, grijalva, returned, to, spain, vel, zquez, decided, to, send, a, third, and, even, larger, expedition, to, explore, the, mexican, coast, hern, n, cort, s, then, one, of, vel, zquez, s, favorites, and, brother, in, law, was, named, as, the, commander, which, created, envy, and, resentment, among, the, spanish, contingent, in, the, spanish, colony, licenses, for, expeditions, allowed, the, crown, to, retain, sovereignty, over, newly, conquered, lands, while, not, risking, its, own, assets, in, the, enterprise, anyone, willing, to, make, a, financial, contribution, could, potentially, gain, even, more, wealth, and, power, men, who, brought, horses, caballeros, received, two, shares, of, the, spoils, one, for, military, service, another, because, of, the, horse, cort, s, invested, a, considerable, part, of, his, personal, fortune, and, probably, went, into, debt, to, borrow, additional, funds, vel, zquez, may, have, personally, contributed, nearly, half, the, cost, of, the, expedition, in, an, agreement, signed, on, 23, october, 1518, governor, vel, zquez, restricted, the, expedition, led, by, cort, s, to, exploration, and, trade, so, that, conquest, and, settlement, of, the, mainland, might, occur, under, his, own, command, once, he, had, received, the, permission, necessary, to, do, so, which, he, had, already, requested, from, the, crown, in, this, way, vel, zquez, sought, to, ensure, title, to, the, riches, and, laborers, discovered, however, armed, with, the, knowledge, of, castilian, law, that, he, had, likely, gained, as, a, notary, in, valladolid, cort, s, managed, to, free, himself, of, vel, zquez, s, authority, by, presenting, vel, zquez, as, a, tyrant, acting, in, his, own, self, interest, and, not, in, the, interest, of, the, crown, the, men, under, cort, s, also, named, him, military, leader, and, chief, magistrate, judge, of, the, expedition, vel, zquez, himself, must, have, been, keenly, aware, that, whoever, conquered, the, mainland, for, spain, would, gain, fame, glory, and, fortune, to, eclipse, anything, that, could, be, achieved, in, cuba, thus, as, the, preparations, for, departure, drew, to, a, close, the, governor, became, suspicious, that, cort, s, would, be, disloyal, to, him, and, try, to, commandeer, the, expedition, for, his, own, purposes, namely, to, establish, himself, as, governor, of, the, colony, independent, of, vel, zquez, s, control, therefore, vel, zquez, sent, luis, de, medina, with, orders, to, replace, cort, s, however, cort, s, s, brother, in, law, allegedly, had, medina, intercepted, and, killed, the, papers, that, medina, had, been, carrying, were, sent, to, cort, s, thus, warned, cort, s, accelerated, the, organization, and, preparation, of, his, expedition, vel, zquez, arrived, at, the, dock, in, santiago, de, cuba, in, person, he, and, cort, s, again, embraced, with, a, great, exchange, of, compliments, before, cort, s, set, sail, for, trinidad, cuba, vel, zquez, then, sent, orders, for, the, fleet, to, be, held, and, cort, s, taken, prisoner, nevertheless, cort, s, set, sail, beginning, his, expedition, with, the, legal, status, of, a, mutineer, 49, 51, 55, 56, cort, s, s, contingent, consisted, of, 11, ships, carrying, about, 630, men, including, 30, crossbowmen, and, 12, arquebusiers, an, early, form, of, firearm, a, doctor, several, carpenters, at, least, eight, women, a, few, hundred, arawaks, from, cuba, and, some, africans, both, freedmen, and, slaves, although, modern, usage, often, calls, the, european, participants, soldiers, the, term, was, never, used, by, these, men, themselves, in, any, context, something, that, james, lockhart, realized, when, analyzing, sixteenth, century, legal, records, from, conquest, era, peru, cort, s, spent, some, time, at, the, island, of, cozumel, on, the, east, coast, of, yucat, n, trying, to, convert, the, locals, to, christianity, something, that, provided, mixed, results, while, at, cozumel, cort, s, heard, reports, of, other, white, men, living, in, the, yucat, n, cort, s, sent, messengers, to, these, reported, spaniards, who, turned, out, to, be, the, survivors, of, a, spanish, shipwreck, that, had, occurred, in, 1511, ger, nimo, de, aguilar, and, gonzalo, guerrero, aguilar, petitioned, his, maya, chieftain, to, be, allowed, to, join, his, former, countrymen, and, he, was, released, and, made, his, way, to, cort, s, s, ships, now, quite, fluent, in, maya, as, well, as, some, other, indigenous, languages, proved, to, be, a, valuable, asset, for, cort, s, as, a, translator, a, skill, of, particular, significance, to, the, later, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, that, was, to, be, the, result, of, cort, s, s, expedition, according, to, bernal, d, az, aguilar, relayed, that, before, coming, he, had, attempted, to, convince, guerrero, to, leave, as, well, guerrero, declined, on, the, basis, that, he, was, by, now, well, assimilated, with, the, maya, culture, had, a, maya, wife, and, three, children, and, he, was, looked, upon, as, a, figure, of, rank, within, the, maya, state, of, chetumal, where, he, lived, although, guerrero, s, later, fate, is, somewhat, uncertain, it, appears, that, for, some, years, he, continued, to, fight, alongside, the, maya, forces, against, spanish, incursions, providing, military, counsel, and, encouraging, resistance, it, is, speculated, that, he, may, have, been, killed, in, a, later, battle, after, leaving, cozumel, cort, s, continued, round, the, tip, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, and, landed, at, potonch, n, where, there, was, little, gold, after, defeating, the, local, natives, in, two, battles, he, discovered, a, far, more, valuable, asset, in, the, form, of, a, woman, whom, cort, s, would, have, christened, marina, she, is, often, known, as, la, malinche, and, also, sometimes, called, malintzin, or, malinalli, later, the, aztecs, would, come, to, call, cort, s, malintzin, or, la, malinche, by, dint, of, his, close, association, with, her, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, wrote, in, his, account, the, true, history, of, the, conquest, of, new, spain, that, marina, was, truly, a, great, princess, later, the, honorific, spanish, title, of, do, a, would, be, added, to, her, baptized, name, 80, 82, cort, s, had, stumbled, upon, one, of, the, keys, to, realizing, his, ambitions, he, would, speak, to, ger, nimo, de, aguilar, in, spanish, who, would, then, translate, into, mayan, for, marina, she, would, then, translate, from, mayan, to, nahuatl, with, this, pair, of, translators, cort, s, could, now, communicate, to, the, aztecs, 86, 87, how, effectively, is, still, a, matter, of, speculation, since, marina, did, not, speak, the, dialect, of, the, aztecs, nor, was, she, familiar, with, the, protocols, of, the, aztec, nobility, who, were, renowned, for, their, flowery, flattering, talk, do, a, marina, quickly, learned, spanish, and, became, cort, s, s, primary, interpreter, confidant, consort, cultural, translator, and, the, mother, of, his, first, son, martin, 82, until, cort, s, s, marriage, to, his, second, wife, a, union, which, produced, a, legitimate, son, whom, he, also, named, martin, cort, s, s, natural, son, with, marina, was, the, heir, of, his, envisaged, fortunes, native, speakers, of, the, nahuatl, community, would, call, her, malintzin, making, her, name, a, part, of, their, own, language, trying, their, best, to, make, it, similar, to, the, spanish, marina, over, time, la, malinche, the, modern, spanish, cognate, of, malintzin, became, a, term, for, a, traitor, to, one, s, people, to, this, day, the, word, malinchista, is, used, by, mexicans, to, denote, one, who, apes, the, language, and, customs, of, another, country, it, would, not, be, until, the, late, 20th, century, that, a, few, feminist, writers, and, academics, in, mexico, would, attempt, to, rehabilitate, la, malinche, as, a, woman, who, made, the, best, of, her, situation, and, became, in, many, respects, a, powerful, woman, cort, s, landed, his, expedition, force, on, the, coast, of, the, modern, day, state, of, veracruz, in, april, 1519, during, this, same, period, soon, after, he, arrived, cort, s, was, welcomed, by, representatives, of, the, aztec, emperor, moctezuma, ii, gifts, were, exchanged, and, cort, s, attempted, to, frighten, the, aztec, delegation, with, a, display, of, his, firepower, 26, 89, 91, faced, with, imprisonment, or, death, for, defying, the, governor, cort, s, only, alternative, was, to, continue, his, enterprise, in, the, hope, of, redeeming, himself, and, his, men, with, the, spanish, crown, to, do, this, his, men, established, a, settlement, called, la, villa, rica, de, la, vera, cruz, or, true, cross, since, they, arrived, on, maundy, thursday, and, landed, on, good, friday, the, legally, constituted, town, council, of, villa, rica, then, promptly, offered, him, the, position, of, adelantado, or, chief, justice, and, captain, general, 102, this, strategy, was, not, unique, vel, squez, had, used, this, same, legal, mechanism, to, free, himself, from, diego, columbus, authority, in, cuba, in, being, named, adelantado, by, a, duly, constituted, cabildo, cort, s, was, able, to, free, himself, from, vel, squez, s, authority, and, continue, his, expedition, to, ensure, the, legality, of, this, action, several, members, of, his, expedition, including, francisco, montejo, and, alonso, hernandez, puertocarrero, returned, to, spain, to, seek, acceptance, of, the, cabildo, s, declaration, with, king, charles, 127, 28, cort, s, learned, of, an, indigenous, settlement, called, cempoala, and, marched, his, forces, there, on, their, arrival, in, cempoala, they, were, greeted, by, 20, dignitaries, and, cheering, townsfolk, 88, 107, cort, s, quickly, persuaded, the, totonac, chiefs, to, rebel, against, the, aztecs, taking, prisoner, five, of, moctezuma, s, tax, collectors, 111, 13, the, totonacs, also, helped, cort, s, build, the, town, of, villa, rica, de, la, vera, cruz, which, was, the, starting, point, for, his, attempt, to, conquer, the, aztec, empire, 114, hearing, of, the, rebellion, more, ambassadors, from, the, aztec, emperor, returned, to, see, cort, s, bearing, gifts, of, gold, and, cloth, in, thankfulness, for, cort, s, freeing, his, tax, collectors, moctezuma, also, told, cort, s, he, was, certain, the, spanish, were, of, his, own, race, and, had, arrived, as, his, ancestors, had, foretold, as, cort, s, told, his, men, the, natives, think, of, us, as, gods, or, godlike, beings, 13, 21, 25, 33, 35, 115, 17, although, they, attempted, to, dissuade, cort, s, from, visiting, tenochtitlan, the, lavish, gifts, and, the, polite, welcoming, remarks, only, encouraged, el, caudillo, to, continue, his, march, towards, the, capital, of, the, empire, 96, 166, men, still, loyal, to, the, governor, of, cuba, planned, to, seize, a, ship, and, escape, to, cuba, but, cort, s, moved, swiftly, to, squash, their, plans, two, leaders, were, condemned, to, be, hanged, two, were, lashed, and, one, had, his, foot, mutilated, to, make, sure, such, a, mutiny, did, not, happen, again, he, decided, to, scuttle, his, ships, 128, 30, there, is, a, popular, misconception, that, the, ships, were, burned, rather, than, sunk, this, misconception, has, been, attributed, to, the, reference, made, by, cervantes, de, salaz, r, in, 1546, as, to, cort, s, burning, his, ships, this, may, have, also, come, from, a, mistranslation, of, the, version, of, the, story, written, in, latin, with, all, of, his, ships, scuttled, cort, s, effectively, stranded, the, expedition, in, central, mexico, however, it, did, not, completely, end, the, aspirations, of, those, members, of, his, company, who, remained, loyal, to, the, governor, of, cuba, cort, s, then, led, his, band, inland, towards, tenochtitlan, in, addition, to, the, spaniards, cort, s, force, now, included, 40, cempoalan, warrior, chiefs, and, at, least, 200, other, natives, whose, task, was, to, drag, the, cannon, and, carry, supplies, 134, the, cempoalans, were, accustomed, to, the, hot, climate, of, the, coast, but, they, suffered, immensely, from, the, cold, of, the, mountains, the, rain, and, the, hail, as, they, marched, towards, tenochtitlan, cort, s, soon, arrived, at, tlaxcala, a, confederacy, of, about, 200, towns, and, different, tribes, but, without, central, government, the, otomi, initially, and, then, the, tlaxcalans, fought, the, spanish, in, a, series, of, three, battles, from, 2, to, 5, september, 1519, and, at, one, point, diaz, remarked, they, surrounded, us, on, every, side, after, cort, s, continued, to, release, prisoners, with, messages, of, peace, and, realizing, the, spanish, were, enemies, of, moctezuma, xicotencatl, the, elder, and, maxixcatzin, persuaded, the, tlaxcalan, warleader, xicotencatl, the, younger, that, it, would, be, better, to, ally, with, the, newcomers, than, to, kill, them, 143, 55, 171, the, tlaxcalans, main, city, was, tlaxcala, after, almost, a, century, of, fighting, the, flower, wars, a, great, deal, of, hatred, and, bitterness, had, developed, between, the, tlaxcalans, and, the, aztecs, the, aztecs, had, already, conquered, most, of, the, territory, around, tlaxcala, and, waged, war, on, them, every, year, 154, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, aztecs, left, tlaxcala, independent, so, that, they, would, have, a, constant, supply, of, war, captives, to, sacrifice, to, their, gods, on, 23, september, 1519, cort, s, arrived, in, tlaxcala, and, was, greeted, with, joy, by, the, rulers, who, saw, the, spanish, as, an, ally, against, the, aztecs, due, to, a, commercial, blockade, by, the, aztecs, tlaxcala, was, poor, lacking, among, other, things, salt, and, cotton, cloths, so, they, could, only, offer, cort, s, and, his, men, food, and, slaves, cort, s, stayed, twenty, days, in, tlaxcala, giving, his, men, time, to, recover, from, their, wounds, from, the, battles, cort, s, seems, to, have, won, the, true, friendship, and, loyalty, of, the, senior, leaders, of, tlaxcala, among, them, maxixcatzin, and, xicotencatl, the, elder, although, he, could, not, win, the, heart, of, xicotencatl, the, younger, the, spaniards, agreed, to, respect, parts, of, the, city, like, the, temples, and, reportedly, took, only, the, things, that, were, offered, to, them, freely, 172, 74, as, before, with, other, native, groups, cort, s, preached, to, the, tlaxcalan, leaders, about, the, benefits, of, christianity, the, caciques, gave, cort, s, the, most, beautiful, of, their, daughters, and, nieces, xicotencatl, the, elder, s, daughter, was, baptized, as, do, a, luisa, and, maxixcatzin, s, daughter, as, do, a, elvira, they, were, given, by, cort, s, to, pedro, de, alvarado, and, juan, vel, zquez, de, le, n, respectively, 176, 78, legends, say, that, he, convinced, the, four, leaders, of, tlaxcala, to, become, baptized, maxixcatzin, xicotencatl, the, elder, citalpopocatzin, and, temiloltecutl, received, the, names, of, don, lorenzo, don, vicente, don, bartolom, and, don, gonzalo, it, is, impossible, to, know, if, these, leaders, understood, the, catholic, faith, in, any, case, they, apparently, had, no, problems, in, adding, the, christian, dios, god, in, spanish, the, lord, of, the, heavens, to, their, already, complex, pantheon, of, gods, an, exchange, of, gifts, was, made, and, thus, began, the, highly, significant, and, effective, alliance, between, cort, s, and, tlaxcala, meanwhile, moctezuma, s, ambassadors, who, had, been, in, the, spanish, camp, after, the, battles, with, the, tlaxcalans, continued, to, press, cort, s, to, take, the, road, to, mexico, via, cholula, which, was, under, aztec, control, rather, than, over, huexotzinco, which, was, an, ally, of, tlaxcala, they, were, surprised, cort, s, had, stayed, in, tlaxcala, so, long, among, a, poor, and, ill, bred, people, 166, 185, 86, cholula, was, one, of, the, most, important, cities, of, mesoamerica, the, second, largest, and, probably, the, most, sacred, its, huge, pyramid, larger, in, volume, than, the, great, pyramids, of, egypt, made, it, one, of, the, most, prestigious, places, of, the, aztec, religion, however, it, appears, that, cort, s, perceived, cholula, more, as, a, military, threat, to, his, rear, guard, than, a, religious, center, as, he, marched, to, tenochtitlan, he, sent, emissaries, ahead, to, try, a, diplomatic, solution, to, enter, the, city, cort, s, who, had, not, yet, decided, to, start, a, war, with, the, aztec, empire, decided, to, offer, a, compromise, he, accepted, the, gifts, of, the, aztec, ambassadors, and, at, the, same, time, accepted, the, offer, of, the, tlaxcalan, allies, to, provide, porters, and, 1, 000, warriors, on, his, march, to, cholula, he, also, sent, two, men, pedro, de, alvarado, and, bernardino, v, zquez, de, tapia, directly, to, tenochtitlan, as, ambassadors, and, to, scout, for, an, appropriate, route, 186, 88, there, are, contradictory, reports, about, what, happened, at, cholula, moctezuma, had, apparently, decided, to, resist, with, force, the, advance, of, cort, s, and, his, troops, and, it, seems, that, moctezuma, ordered, the, leaders, of, cholula, to, try, to, stop, the, spanish, cholula, had, a, very, small, army, because, as, a, sacred, city, they, put, their, confidence, in, their, prestige, and, their, gods, according, to, the, chronicles, of, the, tlaxcalteca, the, priests, of, cholula, expected, to, use, the, power, of, quetzalcoatl, their, primary, god, against, the, invaders, 193, 199, cort, s, and, his, men, entered, cholula, without, active, resistance, however, they, were, not, met, by, the, city, leaders, and, were, not, given, food, and, drink, on, the, third, day, 192, cempoalans, reported, that, fortifications, were, being, constructed, around, the, city, and, the, tlaxcalans, were, warning, the, spaniards, 193, finally, la, malinche, informed, cort, s, after, talking, to, the, wife, of, one, of, the, lords, of, cholula, that, the, locals, planned, to, murder, the, spanish, in, their, sleep, 196, although, he, did, not, know, if, the, rumor, was, true, or, not, cort, s, ordered, a, pre, emptive, strike, urged, by, the, tlaxcalans, the, enemies, of, the, cholulans, cort, s, confronted, the, city, leaders, in, the, main, temple, alleging, that, they, were, planning, to, attack, his, men, they, admitted, that, they, had, been, ordered, to, resist, by, moctezuma, but, they, claimed, they, had, not, followed, his, orders, regardless, on, command, the, spaniards, seized, and, killed, many, of, the, local, nobles, to, serve, as, a, lesson, 199, they, captured, the, cholulan, leaders, tlaquiach, and, tlalchiac, and, then, ordered, the, city, to, be, set, on, fire, the, troops, started, in, the, palace, of, xacayatzin, and, then, on, to, chialinco, and, yetzcoloc, in, letters, to, his, king, cort, s, claimed, that, in, three, hours, time, his, troops, helped, by, the, tlaxcalans, killed, 3, 000, people, and, had, burned, the, city, another, witness, v, zquez, de, tapia, claimed, the, death, toll, was, as, high, as, 30, 000, however, since, the, women, and, children, and, many, men, had, already, fled, the, city, 200, 01, it, is, unlikely, that, so, many, were, killed, regardless, the, massacre, of, the, nobility, of, cholula, was, a, notorious, chapter, in, the, conquest, of, mexico, the, azteca, and, tlaxcalteca, histories, of, the, events, leading, up, to, the, massacre, vary, the, tlaxcalteca, claimed, that, their, ambassador, patlahuatzin, was, sent, to, cholula, and, had, been, tortured, by, the, cholula, thus, cort, s, was, avenging, him, by, attacking, cholula, 46, 47, historia, de, tlaxcala, por, diego, mu, oz, camargo, lib, ii, cap, v, 1550, the, azteca, version, put, the, blame, on, the, tlaxcalteca, claiming, that, they, resented, cort, s, going, to, cholula, instead, of, huexotzingo, the, massacre, had, a, chilling, effect, on, the, other, city, states, and, groups, affiliated, with, the, aztecs, as, well, as, the, aztecs, themselves, tales, of, the, massacre, convinced, the, other, cities, in, the, aztec, empire, to, entertain, seriously, cort, s, proposals, rather, than, risk, the, same, fate, 203, cort, s, then, sent, emissaries, to, moctezuma, with, the, message, that, the, people, of, cholula, had, treated, him, with, trickery, and, had, therefore, been, punished, 204, in, one, of, his, responses, to, cort, s, moctezuma, blamed, the, commanders, of, the, local, aztec, garrison, for, the, resistance, in, cholula, and, recognizing, that, his, long, standing, attempts, to, dissuade, cort, s, from, coming, to, tenochtitlan, with, gifts, of, gold, and, silver, had, failed, moctezuma, finally, invited, the, conquistadors, to, visit, his, capital, city, according, to, spanish, sources, after, feeling, as, though, nothing, else, could, be, done, 205, 06, on, 8, november, 1519, after, the, fall, of, cholula, cort, s, and, his, forces, entered, tenochtitlan, the, island, capital, of, the, mexica, aztecs, 219, it, is, believed, that, the, city, was, one, of, the, largest, in, the, world, at, that, time, and, the, largest, in, the, americas, up, to, that, point, the, most, common, estimates, put, the, population, at, around, 60, 000, to, over, 300, 000, people, if, the, population, of, tenochtitlan, was, 250, 000, in, 1519, then, tenochtitlan, would, have, been, larger, than, every, city, in, europe, except, perhaps, naples, and, constantinople, and, four, times, the, size, of, seville, to, the, aztecs, tenochtitlan, was, the, altar, for, the, empire, as, well, as, being, the, city, that, quetzalcoatl, would, eventually, return, to, upon, meeting, hernan, cort, s, claimed, to, be, the, representative, of, the, queen, do, a, juana, of, castile, and, her, son, king, carlos, i, of, castile, and, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, all, spanish, royalty, had, then, made, an, appearance, sahag, n, reports, that, moctezuma, welcomed, cort, s, to, tenochtitlan, on, the, great, causeway, xolac, 216, 17, the, chiefs, who, accompanied, moctezuma, were, cacamatzin, king, of, tetzcoco, tetlepanquetzaltin, king, of, tlacopan, itzcuauhtzin, the, tlacochcalcatl, lord, of, tlatelolco, and, topantemoc, motechzoma, s, treasurer, in, tlatelolco, 65, moctezuma, and, his, chiefs, were, adorned, with, blazing, gold, on, their, shoulders, with, feathers, and, jewels, on, the, causeway, where, the, two, groups, met, enormous, numbers, of, people, from, tenochtitlan, watched, the,

was, restrained, by, cuitlahuac, and, cacamatzin, cort, s, was, not, permitted, to, touch, the, emperor, no, one, was, allowed, after, greetings, moctezuma, personally, dressed, only, cort, s, in, a, priceless, feather, work, flower, a, golden, jewelry, studded, necklace, and, a, garland, of, flowers, moctezuma, then, brought, cort, s, to, the, shrine, of, the, goddess, toci, where, he, gave, him, a, more, private, greeting, in, which, he, practically, gave, the, aztec, empire, to, cort, s, as, he, reportedly, said, that, it, was, his, desire, to, serve, a, fragment, of, the, greetings, of,

to, several, spanish, versions, some, written, years, or, decades, later, moctezuma, first, repeated, his, earlier, flowery, welcome, to, cort, s, on, the, great, causeway, but, then, went, on, to, explain, his, view, of, what, the, spanish, expedition, represented, in, terms, of, aztec, tradition, and, lore, including, the, idea, that, cort, s, and, his, men, pale, bearded, men, from, the, east, were, the, return, of, characters, from, aztec, legend, 220, 21, at, the, end, of, this, explanation, the, emperor, pledged, his, loyalty, to, the, king, of, spain, and, accepted, cort, s, as, the, king, s, representative, according, to, diaz, moctezuma, said, to, cort, s, as, for, your, great, king, i, am, in, his, debt, and, will, give, him, of, what, i, possess, 223, while, in, the,

and, an, image, of, virgin, mary, next, to, the, two, large, idols, of, huichilobos, and, tezcatlipoca, after, climbing, the, one, hundred, and, fourteen, steps, to, the, top, of, the, main, temple, pyramid, a, central, place, for, religious, authority, moctezuma, and, his, papas, were, furious, at, the, suggestion, with, moctezuma, claiming, his, idols, give, us, health, and, rain, and, crops,

against, any, further, resistance, until, the, end, of, may, 1520, moctezuma, lived, with, cort, s, in, the, palace, of, axay, catl, however, moctezuma, continued, to, act, as, emperor, subject, to, cort, s, overall, control, 248, during, the, period, of, his, imprisonment, moctezuma, stated, he, was, glad, to, be, a, prisoner, since, either, our, gods, gave, us, power, to, confine, him, or, huichilobos, permitted, it, he, would, even, play, the, game, of, totoloque, with, cort, s, 252, after, the, treason, of, cacamatzin, moctezuma, and, his, caciques, were, forced, to, take, a, more, formal, oath, of, allegiance, to, the, king, of, spain, though, moctezuma, could, not, restrain, his, tears, 265, moctezuma, told, his, caciques, that, their, ancestral, tradition, set, down, in,

king, which, included, his, father, s, treasure, these, treasures, the, spaniards, melted, down, to, form, gold, bars, stamped, with, an, iron, die, 66, 68, 270, 72, finally, moctezuma, let, the, catholic, conquistadors, build, an, altar, on, their, temple, next, to, the, aztec, idols, 277, finally, the, aztec, gods, allegedly, told, the, mexican, papas, or, priests, they, would, not, stay, unless, the, spaniards, were, killed, and, driven, back, across, the, sea, moctezuma, warned, cort, s, to, leave, at, once, as, their, lives, were, at, risk, 278, 79, many, of, the, nobility, rallied, around, cuitl, huac, 294, the, brother, of, moctezuma, and, his, heir, apparent, however, most, of, them, could, take, no, overt, action, against, the, spanish, unless, the, order, was, given, by, the, emperor, 247, in, april, 1520, cort, s, was, told, by, moctezuma, that, a, much, larger, party, of, spanish, troops, had, arrived, consisting, of, nineteen, ships, and, fourteen, hundred, soldiers, under, the, command, of, p, nfilo, de, narv, ez, narv, ez, had, been, sent, by, governor, vel, zquez, from, cuba, to, kill, or, capture, cort, s, who, had, defied, velazquez, s, orders, 281, leaving, his, least, reliable, soldiers, under, the, command, of, the, headstrong, pedro, de, alvarado, to, guard, moctezuma, cort, s, set, out, against, narv, ez, who, had, advanced, onto, cempoala, cort, s, surprised, his, antagonist, with, a, night, attack, during, which, his, men, wounded, narv, ez, in, the, eye, and, took, him, prisoner, after, cort, s, permitted, the, defeated, soldiers, to, settle, in, the, country, they, passed, with, more, or, less, willingness, to, cort, s, side, hern, n, cort, s, gained, their, support, when, he, promised, to, make, them, rich, and, give, them, commands, cort, s, then, made, a, rapid, return, to, tenochtitlan, to, relieve, the, besieged, alvarado, and, the, other, invaders, 282, 84, cort, s, led, his, combined, forces, on, an, arduous, trek, back, over, the, sierra, madre, oriental, returning, to, mexico, on, st, john, s, day, june, 1520, with, 1, 300, soldiers, and, 96, horses, plus, 2, 000, tlaxcalan, warriors, 284, when, cort, s, returned, to, tenochtitlan, in, late, may, he, found, that, alvarado, and, his, men, had, attacked, and, killed, many, of, the, aztec, nobility, in, the, massacre, in, the, great, temple, that, happened, during, a, religious, festival, organized, by, the, aztecs, the, great, temple, was, central, to, the, aztecs, cosmological, views, the, temple, served, as, a, burial, ground, for, the, offerings, made, to, different, gods, such, as, the, gods, of, fertility, mountains, rain, and, earth, considering, the, centrality, and, the, importance, of, the, great, temple, as, a, religious, and, cultural, monument, could, potentially, have, influenced, the, decision, to, attack, a, location, such, as, this, alvarado, s, explanation, to, cort, s, was, that, the, spaniards, had, learned, that, the, aztecs, planned, to, attack, the, spanish, garrison, in, the, city, once, the, festival, was, complete, so, he, had, launched, a, preemptive, attack, 286, in, any, event, the, population, of, the, city, rose, en, masse, after, the, spanish, attack, which, the, spanish, did, not, expect, fierce, fighting, ensued, and, the, aztec, troops, besieged, the, palace, housing, the, spaniards, and, moctezuma, alvarado, and, the, rest, of, the, spanish, were, held, hostage, by, the, aztecs, for, a, month, the, nobility, of, tenochtitlan, chose, cuitl, huac, as, huey, tlatoani, emperor, cort, s, ordered, moctezuma, to, speak, to, his, people, from, a, palace, balcony, and, persuade, them, to, let, the, spanish, return, to, the, coast, in, peace, moctezuma, was, jeered, and, stones, were, thrown, at, him, mortally, wounding, him, 287, 94, aztec, sources, state, the, spaniards, killed, him, 90, cort, s, had, formed, an, alliance, with, tlaxcala, this, alliance, had, many, victories, including, the, overtaking, of, the, aztec, capital, tenochtitlan, their, capital, was, used, as, a, cosmic, center, where, they, fed, sacrifices, to, the, gods, through, both, human, bodies, and, bloodletting, the, capital, was, also, used, for, central, and, imperialistic, governmental, control, preparations, for, war, began, in, their, capital, the, spanish, and, their, allies, including, the, tlaxcala, had, to, flee, the, central, city, as, the, people, of, tenochtitlan, had, risen, against, them, the, spaniards, situation, could, only, deteriorate, because, the, aztecs, had, removed, the, bridges, over, the, gaps, in, the, causeways, that, linked, the, city, to, the, surrounding, lands, cort, s, men, constructed, a, portable, bridge, to, cross, the, water, of, the, lake, on, the, rainy, night, of, 10, july, 1520, the, spaniards, and, their, allies, set, out, for, the, mainland, via, the, causeway, to, tlacopan, they, placed, the, portable, bridge, in, the, first, gap, but, at, that, moment, their, movement, was, detected, and, aztec, forces, attacked, both, along, the, causeway, and, by, means, of, canoes, on, the, lake, the, spanish, were, thus, caught, on, a, narrow, road, with, water, or, buildings, on, both, sides, 297, 99, 305, the, retreat, quickly, turned, into, a, rout, the, spanish, discovered, that, they, could, not, remove, their, portable, bridge, unit, from, the, first, gap, and, so, had, no, choice, but, to, leave, it, behind, the, bulk, of, the, spanish, infantry, left, behind, by, cort, s, and, the, other, horsemen, had, to, cut, their, way, through, the, masses, of, aztec, warriors, opposing, them, many, of, the, spaniards, weighed, down, by, their, armor, and, booty, drowned, in, the, causeway, gaps, or, were, killed, by, the, aztecs, much, of, the, wealth, the, spaniards, had, acquired, in, tenochtitlan, was, lost, the, bridge, was, later, called, alvarado, s, leap, 299, 300, 306, the, channel, is, now, a, street, in, mexico, city, called, puente, de, alvarado, alvarado, s, bridge, because, it, seemed, alvarado, escaped, across, an, invisible, bridge, he, may, have, been, walking, on, the, bodies, of, those, soldiers, and, attackers, who, had, preceded, him, given, the, shallowness, of, the, lake, it, is, said, that, cort, s, upon, reaching, the, mainland, at, tlacopan, wept, over, their, losses, this, episode, is, called, la, noche, triste, the, night, of, sorrows, and, the, old, tree, el, rbol, de, la, noche, triste, where, cort, s, allegedly, cried, is, still, a, monument, in, mexico, city, the, aztecs, pursued, and, harassed, the, spanish, who, guided, by, their, tlaxcalan, allies, moved, around, lake, zumpango, towards, a, sanctuary, in, tlaxcala, on, 14, july, 1520, the, aztecs, attempted, to, destroy, the, spanish, for, good, at, the, battle, of, otumba, although, hard, pressed, the, spanish, infantry, was, able, to, hold, off, the, overwhelming, numbers, of, enemy, warriors, while, the, spanish, cavalry, under, the, leadership, of, cort, s, charged, through, the, enemy, ranks, again, and, again, when, cort, s, and, his, men, killed, one, of, the, aztec, leaders, the, aztecs, broke, off, the, battle, and, left, the, field, 303, 05, in, this, retreat, the, spaniards, suffered, heavy, casualties, losing, 860, soldiers, 72, other, spanish, members, of, cort, s, group, including, five, women, and, 1, 000, tlaxcalan, warriors, several, aztec, noblemen, loyal, to, cort, s, including, cacamatzin, and, their, families, also, perished, including, moctezuma, s, son, and, two, daughters, 302, 305, 06, the, spanish, were, able, to, complete, their, escape, to, tlaxcala, there, they, were, given, assistance, since, all, 440, of, them, were, wounded, with, only, 20, horses, left, maxixcatzin, xicotencatl, the, elder, and, chichimecatecuhtli, told, cort, s, men, consider, yourselves, at, home, rest, do, not, think, it, a, small, thing, that, you, have, escaped, with, your, lives, from, that, strong, city, if, we, thought, of, you, as, brave, men, before, we, consider, you, much, braver, now, 306, 07, cort, s, got, reinforcements, when, the, panuco, river, settlement, was, abandoned, and, supply, ships, arrived, from, cuba, and, spain, cort, s, also, had, built, 13, brigantines, and, had, them, mounted, with, cannons, turning, lake, texcoco, into, a, strategic, body, of, water, to, assault, tenochtitlan, xicotencatl, the, younger, however, sought, an, alliance, with, the, mexicans, but, was, opposed, 309, 11, cort, s, sent, diego, de, ordaz, and, the, remnants, of, narvaez, s, men, on, a, ship, to, spain, and, francisco, montejo, on, a, ship, to, santo, domingo, to, represent, his, case, in, the, royal, courts, 311, cort, s, was, able, to, pacify, the, country, after, the, indigenous, realized, the, spaniards, put, an, end, to, the, rape, and, robbery, that, the, mexicans, practised, finally, xicotencatl, the, elder, baptized, as, don, lorenzo, de, vargas, agreed, to, support, cort, s, expedition, against, texcoco, according, to, bernal, diaz, he, sent, more, than, 10, 000, warriors, under, the, command, of, chichimecatecuhtli, as, cort, s, marched, on, the, day, after, christmas, 1520, 309, 311, 12, the, aztecs, were, struck, by, a, smallpox, plague, starting, in, september, 1520, which, lasted, seventy, days, many, were, killed, including, their, new, leader, the, emperor, cuitlahuac, 92, 93, the, joint, forces, of, tlaxcala, and, cort, s, proved, to, be, formidable, one, by, one, they, took, over, most, of, the, cities, under, aztec, control, some, in, battle, others, by, diplomacy, in, the, end, only, tenochtitlan, and, the, neighboring, city, of, tlatelolco, remained, unconquered, or, not, allied, with, the, spaniards, 326, 52, cort, s, then, approached, tenochtitlan, and, mounted, a, siege, of, the, city, that, involved, cutting, the, causeways, from, the, mainland, and, controlling, the, lake, with, armed, brigantines, constructed, by, the, spanish, and, transported, overland, to, the, lake, the, siege, of, tenochtitlan, lasted, eight, months, the, besiegers, cut, off, the, supply, of, food, and, destroyed, the, aqueduct, carrying, water, to, the, city, 359, 368, despite, the, stubborn, aztec, resistance, organized, by, their, new, emperor, cuauht, moc, the, cousin, of, moctezuma, ii, tenochtitlan, and, tlatelolco, fell, on, 13, august, 1521, during, which, the, emperor, was, captured, trying, to, escape, the, city, in, a, canoe, the, siege, of, the, city, and, its, defense, had, both, been, brutal, largely, because, he, wanted, to, present, the, city, to, his, king, and, emperor, cort, s, had, made, several, attempts, to, end, the, siege, through, diplomacy, but, all, offers, were, rejected, during, the, battle, the, defenders, cut, the, beating, hearts, from, seventy, spanish, prisoners, of, war, at, the, altar, to, huitzilopochtli, an, act, that, infuriated, the, spaniards, 386, 87, 391, 401, 03, cort, s, then, ordered, the, idols, of, the, aztec, gods, in, the, temples, to, be, taken, down, and, replaced, with, icons, of, christianity, he, also, announced, that, the, temple, would, never, again, be, used, for, human, sacrifice, human, sacrifice, and, reports, of, cannibalism, common, among, the, natives, of, the, aztec, empire, had, been, a, major, reason, motivating, cort, s, and, encouraging, his, soldiers, to, avoid, surrender, while, fighting, to, the, death, tenochtitlan, had, been, almost, totally, destroyed, using, the, manpower, of, the, tlaxcalans, plus, fire, and, cannon, fire, during, the, siege, and, once, it, finally, fell, the, spanish, continued, its, destruction, as, they, soon, began, to, establish, the, foundations, of, what, would, become, mexico, city, on, the, site, the, surviving, aztec, people, were, forbidden, to, live, in, tenochtitlan, and, the, surrounding, isles, and, were, banished, to, live, in, tlatelolco, conquistador, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, seemed, remorseful, after, the, sacking, of, tenochtitlan, he, said, later, in, his, book, the, true, history, of, the, conquest, of, new, spain, that, the, natives, had, showered, them, with, gifts, and, given, them, rooms, and, food, he, was, dazzled, by, the, gardens, and, the, canals, that, flowed, around, the, city, when, i, beheld, the, scenes, around, me, said, d, az, i, thought, within, myself, this, was, the, garden, of, the, world, all, of, the, wonders, i, beheld, that, day, nothing, now, remains, all, is, overthrown, and, lost, after, hearing, about, the, fall, of, the, aztec, empire, irecha, tangaxuan, ii, sent, emissaries, to, the, spanish, victors, the, pur, pecha, empire, was, a, contemporary, and, enemy, of, the, aztec, empire, a, few, spaniards, went, with, them, to, tzintzuntzan, where, they, were, presented, to, the, ruler, and, gifts, were, exchanged, they, returned, with, samples, of, gold, and, cort, s, interest, in, the, tarascan, state, was, awakened, in, 1522, a, spanish, force, under, the, leadership, of, cristobal, de, olid, was, sent, into, pur, pecha, territory, and, arrived, at, tzintzuntzan, within, days, the, imperial, army, numbered, many, thousands, perhaps, as, many, as, 100, 000, but, at, the, crucial, moment, they, chose, not, to, fight, tangaxuan, submitted, to, the, spanish, administration, but, for, his, cooperation, was, allowed, a, large, degree, of, autonomy, this, resulted, in, a, strange, arrangement, where, both, cort, s, and, tang, xuan, considered, themselves, rulers, of, michoac, n, for, the, following, years, the, population, of, the, area, paid, tribute, to, them, both, in, 1529, however, nu, o, beltr, n, de, guzm, n, then, president, of, the, first, audiencia, decided, to, march, on, northwestern, mexico, with, a, force, of, 5, 000, 8, 000, men, in, search, for, new, populations, to, subdue, he, arrived, in, michoac, n, and, found, out, that, tangaxuan, was, still, the, de, facto, ruler, of, his, empire, for, which, the, conquistador, allied, himself, with, don, pedro, panza, cuinier, ngari, against, the, irecha, tangaxuan, was, tried, with, plotting, a, rebellion, withholding, tribute, sodomy, and, heresy, and, he, was, tortured, and, executed, his, ashes, were, thrown, into, the, lerma, river, a, period, of, violence, and, turbulence, began, until, being, fully, calmed, by, vasco, de, quiroga, bishop, of, michoacan, in, 1533, during, the, next, decades, puppet, rulers, were, installed, by, the, spanish, government, the, spanish, conquest, of, yucat, n, took, almost, 170, years, the, whole, process, could, have, taken, longer, were, it, not, for, three, separate, epidemics, that, took, a, heavy, toll, on, the, native, americans, causing, the, population, to, fall, by, half, and, weakening, the, traditional, social, structure, after, the, spanish, conquest, of, central, mexico, expeditions, were, sent, further, northward, in, mesoamerica, to, the, region, known, as, la, gran, chichimeca, the, expeditions, under, nu, o, beltr, n, de, guzm, n, were, particularly, harsh, on, the, chichimeca, population, causing, them, to, rebel, under, the, leadership, of, tenamaxtli, and, thus, launch, the, mixton, war, in, 1540, the, chichimecas, fortified, mixt, n, nochistl, n, and, other, mountain, towns, then, besieged, the, spanish, settlement, in, guadalajara, the, famous, conquistador, pedro, de, alvarado, coming, to, the, aid, of, acting, governor, crist, bal, de, o, ate, led, an, attack, on, nochistl, n, however, the, chichimecas, counter, attacked, and, alvarado, s, forces, were, routed, under, the, leadership, of, viceroy, don, antonio, de, mendoza, the, spanish, forces, and, their, indigenous, allies, ultimately, succeeded, in, recapturing, the, towns, and, suppressing, resistance, however, fighting, did, not, completely, come, to, a, halt, in, the, ensuing, years, in, 1546, spanish, authorities, discovered, silver, in, the, zacatecas, region, and, established, mining, settlements, in, chichimeca, territory, which, altered, the, terrain, and, the, chichimeca, traditional, way, of, life, the, chichimeca, resisted, the, intrusions, on, their, ancestral, lands, by, attacking, travelers, and, merchants, along, the, silver, roads, the, ensuing, chichimeca, war, 1550, 1590, would, become, the, longest, and, costliest, conflict, between, spanish, forces, and, indigenous, peoples, in, the, americas, the, attacks, intensified, with, each, passing, year, in, 1554, the, chichimecas, inflicted, a, great, loss, upon, the, spanish, when, they, attacked, a, train, of, sixty, wagons, and, captured, more, than, 30, 000, pesos, worth, of, valuables, by, the, 1580s, thousands, had, died, and, spanish, mining, settlements, in, chichimeca, territory, were, continually, under, threat, in, 1585, don, alvaro, manrique, de, z, iga, marquis, of, villamanrique, was, appointed, viceroy, the, viceroy, was, infuriated, when, he, learned, that, some, spanish, soldiers, had, begun, supplementing, their, incomes, by, raiding, the, villages, of, peaceful, indians, in, order, to, sell, them, into, slavery, with, no, military, end, to, the, conflict, in, sight, he, was, determined, to, restore, peace, to, that, region, and, launched, a, full, scale, peace, offensive, by, negotiating, with, chichimeca, leaders, and, providing, them, with, lands, agricultural, supplies, and, other, goods, this, policy, of, peace, by, purchase, finally, brought, an, end, to, the, chichimeca, war, l, the, council, of, the, indies, was, constituted, in, 1524, and, the, first, audiencia, in, 1527, in, 1535, charles, v, the, holy, roman, emperor, who, was, as, the, king, of, spain, known, as, charles, i,

cort, s, who, had, demonstrated, that, he, was, independent, minded, and, defied, official, orders, when, he, threw, off, the, authority, of, governor, vel, zquez, in, cuba, the, name, new, spain, had, been, suggested, by, cort, s, and, was, later, confirmed, officially, by, mendoza, the, aztec, empire, ceased, to, exist, with, the, spanish, final, conquest, of, tenochtitlan, in, august, 1521, the, empire, had, been, composed, of, separate, city, states, that, had, either, allied, with, or, been, conquered, by, the, mexica, of, tenochtitlan, and, rendered, tribute, to, the, mexica, while, maintaining, their, internal, ruling, structures, those, polities, now, came, under, spanish, rule, also, retaining, their, internal, structures, of, ruling, elites, and, tribute, paying, commoners, as, well, as, land, holding, and, other, economic, structures, being, largely, intact, two, key, works, by, historian, charles, gibson, tlaxcala, in, the, sixteenth, century, 1952, and, his, monograph, the, aztecs, under, spanish, rule, a, history, of, the, indians, of, the, valley, of, mexico, 1519, 1810, 1964, were, central, in, reshaping, the, historiography, of, the, indigenous, and, their, communities, from, the, spanish, conquest, to, the, 1810, mexican, independence, era, scholars, who, were, part, of, a, branch, of, mesoamerican, ethnohistory, more, recently, called, the, new, philology, have, using, indigenous, texts, in, the, indigenous, languages, been, able, to, examine, in, considerable, detail, how, the, indigenous, lived, during, the, era, of, spanish, colonial, rule, a, major, work, that, utilizes, colonial, era, indigenous, texts, as, its, main, source, is, james, lockhart, s, the, nahuas, after, the, conquest, postconquest, central, mexican, history, and, philology, the, key, to, understanding, how, considerable, continuity, of, pre, conquest, indigenous, structures, was, possible, was, the, spanish, colonial, utilization, of, the, indigenous, nobility, in, the, colonial, era, the, indigenous, nobility, were, largely, recognized, as, nobles, by, the, spanish, colonial, regime, with, privileges, including, the, noble, spanish, title, don, for, noblemen, and, do, a, for, noblewomen, to, this, day, the, title, of, duke, of, moctezuma, is, held, by, a, spanish, noble, family, a, few, of, the, indigenous, nobility, learned, spanish, spanish, friars, taught, indigenous, tribes, to, write, their, own, languages, in, latin, letters, which, soon, became, a, self, perpetuating, tradition, at, the, local, level, their, surviving, writings, are, crucial, in, our, knowledge, of, colonial, era, nahuas, the, first, mendicants, in, central, mexico, particularly, the, franciscans, and, dominicans, learned, the, indigenous, language, of, nahuatl, in, order, to, evangelize, to, the, indigenous, people, in, their, native, tongue, early, mendicants, created, texts, in, order, to, forward, the, project, of, christianization, particularly, important, were, the, 1571, spanish, nahuatl, dictionary, compiled, by, the, franciscan, fray, alonso, de, molina, and, his, 1569, bilingual, nahuatl, spanish, confessional, manual, for, priests, a, major, project, by, the, franciscans, in, mexico, was, the, compilation, of, knowledge, on, nahua, religious, beliefs, and, culture, that, friar, bernardino, de, sahag, n, oversaw, using, indigenous, informants, resulting, in, a, number, of, important, texts, and, culminating, in, a, 12, volume, text, the, general, history, of, the, things, of, new, spain, published, in, english, as, the, florentine, codex, the, spanish, crown, via, the, council, of, the, indies, and, the, franciscan, order, in, the, late, sixteenth, century, became, increasingly, hostile, to, works, in, the, indigenous, languages, written, by, priests, and, clerics, concerned, that, they, were, heretical, and, an, impediment, to, the, indians, true, conversion, to, reward, spaniards, who, participated, in, the, conquest, of, what, is, now, contemporary, mexico, the, spanish, crown, authorized, grants, of, native, labor, in, particular, the, assignment, of, entire, indigenous, communities, to, labor, via, the, encomienda, system, the, indigenous, were, not, slaves, under, this, system, chattel, bought, and, sold, or, removed, from, their, home, community, but, the, system, was, still, one, of, forced, labor, the, indigenous, people, of, central, mexico, had, practices, rendering, labor, and, tribute, products, to, their, polity, s, elites, and, those, elites, to, the, mexica, overlords, in, tenochtitlan, so, the, spanish, system, of, encomienda, was, built, on, pre, existing, patterns, of, labor, service, the, spanish, conquerors, in, mexico, during, the, early, colonial, era, lived, off, the, labor, of, the, indigenous, peoples, due, to, some, horrifying, instances, of, abuse, against, the, native, peoples, bishop, bartolom, de, las, casas, suggested, importing, black, slaves, to, replace, them, las, casas, later, repented, when, he, saw, the, even, worse, treatment, given, to, the, black, slaves, the, other, discovery, that, perpetuated, this, system, of, indigenous, forced, labor, were, the, extensive, silver, mines, discovered, at, potosi, in, higher, peru, now, bolivia, and, other, places, in, the, spanish, empire, in, the, new, world, that, were, worked, for, hundreds, of, years, by, forced, native, labor, and, contributed, most, of, the, wealth, that, flowed, to, spain, according, to, west, slavery, was, a, well, established, institution, among, the, aztecs, and, their, neighbors, during, the, conquest, spaniards, legally, enslaved, large, numbers, of, natives, men, women, and, children, as, booty, of, warfare, branding, each, individual, on, the,

this, wealth, hiring, mercenaries, to, fight, the, protestant, reformation, and, to, halt, the, turkish, invasions, of, europe, the, silver, was, used, to, purchase, commercial, goods, abroad, as, european, manufactured, goods, were, not, in, demand, in, asia, and, the, middle, east, the, manila, galleon, brought, in, far, more, silver, direct, from, south, american, mines, to, china, than,

the, use, of, psilocybin, mushrooms, like, other, pre, christian, traditions, was, quickly, suppressed, in, converting, people, to, catholicism, the, spanish, pushed, for, a, switch, from, teonan, catl, to, the, catholic, sacrament, of, the, eucharist, despite, this, history, in, some, remote, areas, the, use, of, teonan, catl, has, persisted, in, the, 16th, century, perhaps, 240, 000,
