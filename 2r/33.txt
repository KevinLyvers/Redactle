known, how, or, when, native, americans, first, settled, the, americas, and, the, present, day, united, states, the, prevailing, theory, proposes, that, people, from, eurasia, followed, game, across, beringia, a, land, bridge, that, connected, siberia, to, present, day, alaska, during, the, ice, age, and, then, spread, southward, throughout, the, americas, this, migration, may, have, begun, as, early, as, 30, 000, years, ago, and, continued, through, to, about, 10, 000, years, ago, when, the, land, bridge, became, submerged, by, the, rising, sea, level, caused, by, the, melting, glaciers, these, early, inhabitants, called, paleo, indians, soon, diversified, into, hundreds, of, culturally, distinct, settlements, and, countries, this, pre, columbian, era, incorporates, all, periods, in, the, history, of, the, americas, before, the, appearance, of, european, influences, on, the, american, continents, spanning, from, the, original, settlement, in, the, upper, paleolithic, period, to, european, colonization, during, the, early, modern, period, while, the, term, technically, refers, to, the, era, before, christopher, columbus, voyage, in, 1492, in, practice, the, term, usually, includes, the, history, of, american, indigenous, cultures, until, they, were, conquered, or, significantly, influenced, by, europeans, even, if, this, happened, decades, or, centuries, after, columbus, s, initial, landing, by, 10, 000, bce, humans, were, relatively, well, established, throughout, north, america, originally, paleo, indians, hunted, ice, age, megafauna, like, mammoths, but, as, they, began, to, go, extinct, people, turned, instead, to, bison, as, a, food, source, as, time, went, on, foraging, for, berries, and, seeds, became, an, important, alternative, to, hunting, paleo, indians, in, central, mexico, were, the, first, in, the, americas, to, farm, starting, to, plant, corn, beans, and, squash, around, 8, 000, bce, eventually, the, knowledge, began, to, spread, northward, by, 3, 000, bce, corn, was, being, grown, in, the, valleys, of, arizona, and, new, mexico, followed, by, primitive, irrigation, systems, and, by, 300, bce, early, villages, of, the, hohokam, one, of, the, earlier, cultures, in, the, present, day, united, states, was, the, clovis, culture, who, are, primarily, identified, by, the, use, of, fluted, spear, points, called, the, clovis, point, from, 9, 100, to, 8, 850, bce, the, culture, ranged, over, much, of, north, america, and, also, appeared, in, south, america, artifacts, from, this, culture, were, first, excavated, in, 1932, near, clovis, new, mexico, the, folsom, culture, was, similar, but, is, marked, by, the, use, of, the, folsom, point, a, later, migration, identified, by, linguists, anthropologists, and, archeologists, occurred, around, 8, 000, bce, this, included, na, dene, speaking, peoples, who, reached, the, pacific, northwest, by, 5, 000, bce, from, there, they, migrated, along, the, pacific, coast, and, into, the, interior, and, constructed, large, multi, family, dwellings, in, their, villages, which, were, used, only, seasonally, in, the, summer, to, hunt, and, fish, and, in, the, winter, to, gather, food, supplies, another, group, the, oshara, tradition, people, who, lived, from, 5, 500, bce, to, 600, ce, were, part, of, the, archaic, southwest, the, adena, began, constructing, large, earthwork, mounds, around, 600, bce, they, are, the, earliest, known, people, to, have, been, mound, builders, however, there, are, mounds, in, the, united, states, that, predate, this, culture, watson, brake, is, an, 11, mound, complex, in, louisiana, that, dates, to, 3, 500, bce, and, nearby, poverty, point, built, by, the, poverty, point, culture, is, an, earthwork, complex, that, dates, to, 1, 700, bce, these, mounds, likely, served, a, religious, purpose, the, adenans, were, absorbed, into, the, hopewell, tradition, a, powerful, people, who, traded, tools, and, goods, across, a, wide, territory, they, continued, the, adena, tradition, of, mound, building, with, remnants, of, several, thousand, still, in, existence, across, the, core, of, their, former, territory, in, southern, ohio, the, hopewell, pioneered, a, trading, system, called, the, hopewell, exchange, system, which, at, its, greatest, extent, ran, from, the, present, day, southeast, up, to, the, canadian, side, of, lake, ontario, by, 500, ce, the, hopewellians, had, too, disappeared, absorbed, into, the, larger, mississippian, culture, the, mississippians, were, a, broad, group, of, tribes, their, most, important, city, was, cahokia, near, modern, day, st, louis, missouri, at, its, peak, in, the, 12th, century, the, city, had, an, estimated, population, of, 20, 000, larger, than, the, population, of, london, at, the, time, the, entire, city, was, centered, around, a, mound, that, stood, 100, feet, 30, m, tall, cahokia, like, many, other, cities, and, villages, of, the, time, depended, on, hunting, foraging, trading, and, agriculture, and, developed, a, class, system, with, slaves, and, human, sacrifice, that, was, influenced, by, societies, to, the, south, like, the, mayans, in, the, southwest, the, anasazi, began, constructing, stone, and, adobe, pueblos, around, 900, bce, these, apartment, like, structures, were, often, built, into, cliff, faces, as, seen, in, the, cliff, palace, at, mesa, verde, some, grew, to, be, the, size, of, cities, with, pueblo, bonito, along, the, chaco, river, in, new, mexico, once, consisting, of, 800, rooms, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, pacific, northwest, were, likely, the, most, affluent, native, americans, many, distinct, cultural, groups, and, political, entities, developed, there, but, they, all, shared, certain, beliefs, traditions, and, practices, such, as, the, centrality, of, salmon, as, a, resource, and, spiritual, symbol, permanent, villages, began, to, develop, in, this, region, as, early, as, 1, 000, bce, and, these, communities, celebrated, by, the, gift, giving, feast, of, the, potlatch, these, gatherings, were, usually, organized, to, commemorate, special, events, such, as, the, raising, of, a, totem, pole, or, the, celebration, of, a, new, chief, in, present, day, upstate, new, york, the, iroquois, formed, a, confederacy, of, tribal, peoples, in, the, mid, 15th, century, consisting, of, the, oneida, mohawk, onondaga, cayuga, and, seneca, their, system, of, affiliation, was, a, kind, of, federation, different, from, the, strong, centralized, european, monarchies, each, tribe, had, seats, in, a, group, of, 50, sachem, chiefs, it, has, been, suggested, that, their, culture, contributed, to, political, thinking, during, the, development, of, the, united, states, government, the, iroquois, were, powerful, waging, war, with, many, neighboring, tribes, and, later, europeans, as, their, territory, expanded, smaller, tribes, were, forced, further, west, including, the, osage, kaw, ponca, and, omaha, peoples, the, exact, date, for, the, settling, of, hawaii, is, disputed, but, the, first, settlement, most, likely, took, place, between, 940, and, 1130, ce, around, 1200, ce, tahitian, explorers, found, and, began, settling, the, area, as, well, establishing, a, new, caste, system, this, marked, the, rise, of, the, hawaiian, civilization, which, would, be, largely, separated, from, the, rest, of, the, world, until, the, arrival, of, the, british, 600, years, later, europeans, under, the, british, explorer, james, cook, arrived, in, the, hawaiian, islands, in, 1778, and, within, five, years, of, contact, european, military, technology, would, help, kamehameha, i, conquer, most, of, the, island, group, and, eventually, unify, the, islands, for, the, first, time, establishing, the, hawaiian, kingdom, the, island, of, puerto, rico, has, been, settled, for, at, least, 4, 000, years, dating, back, to, the, remains, of, puerto, ferro, man, starting, with, the, ortoiroid, culture, successive, generations, of, native, migrations, arrived, replacing, or, absorbing, local, populations, by, the, year, 1000, arawak, people, had, arrived, from, south, america, via, the, lesser, antilles, these, settlers, would, become, the, ta, no, encountered, by, the, spanish, in, 1493, upon, european, contact, a, native, population, between, 30, 000, and, 60, 000, was, likely, led, by, a, single, chief, called, a, cacique, colonization, resulted, in, the, decimation, of, the, local, inhabitants, due, to, the, harsh, encomienda, system, and, epidemics, caused, by, old, world, diseases, puerto, rico, would, remain, a, part, of, spain, until, american, annexation, in, 1898, the, earliest, recorded, european, mention, of, america, is, in, a, historical, treatise, by, the, medieval, chronicler, adam, of, bremen, circa, 1075, where, it, is, referred, to, as, vinland, it, is, also, extensively, referred, to, in, the, 13th, century, norse, vinland, sagas, which, relate, to, events, which, occurred, around, 1000, whilst, the, strongest, archaeological, evidence, of, the, existence, of, norse, settlements, in, america, is, located, in, canada, most, notably, at, l, anse, aux, meadows, and, dated, to, circa, 1000, there, is, significant, scholarly, debate, as, to, whether, norse, explorers, also, made, landfall, in, new, england, and, other, east, coast, areas, in, 1925, president, calvin, coolidge, declared, that, a, norse, explorer, called, leif, erikson, c, 970, c, 1020, was, the, first, european, to, discover, america, the, spaniards, then, rediscovered, america, in, 1492, after, a, period, of, exploration, sponsored, by, major, european, states, the, first, successful, english, settlement, was, established, in, 1607, europeans, brought, horses, cattle, and, hogs, to, the, americas, and, in, turn, took, back, maize, turkeys, tomatoes, potatoes, tobacco, beans, and, squash, to, europe, many, explorers, and, early, settlers, died, after, being, exposed, to, new, diseases, in, the, americas, however, the, effects, of, new, eurasian, diseases, carried, by, the, colonists, especially, smallpox, and, measles, were, much, worse, for, the, native, americans, as, they, had, no, immunity, to, them, they, suffered, epidemics, and, died, in, very, large, numbers, usually, before, large, scale, european, settlement, began, their, societies, were, disrupted, and, hollowed, out, by, the, scale, of, deaths, spanish, explorers, were, the, first, europeans, after, the, norse, to, reach, the, present, day, united, states, after, christopher, columbus, s, expeditions, beginning, in, 1492, established, possessions, in, the, caribbean, including, the, modern, day, u, s, territories, of, puerto, rico, and,

irish, pushed, into, the, far, western, frontier, the, overwhelmingly, rural, southern, colonies, contrasted, sharply, with, the, new, england, and, middle, colonies, after, virginia, the, second, british, colony, south, of, new, england, was, maryland, established, as, a, catholic, haven, in, 1632, the, economy, of, these, two, colonies, was, built, entirely, on, yeoman, farmers, and, planters, the, planters, established, themselves, in, the, tidewater, region, of, virginia, establishing, massive, plantations, with, slave, labor, in, 1670, the, province, of, carolina, was, established, and, charleston, became, the, region, s, great, trading, port, while, virginia, s, economy, was, also, based, on, tobacco, carolina, was, more, diversified, exporting, rice, indigo, and, lumber, as, well, in, 1712, it, was, divided, in, two, creating, north, and, south, carolina, the, georgia, colony, the, last, of, the, thirteen, colonies, was, established, by, james, oglethorpe, in, 1732, as, a, border, to, spanish, florida, and, a, reform, colony, for, former, prisoners, and, the, poor, religiosity, expanded, greatly, after, the, first, great, awakening, a, religious, revival, in, the, 1740s, which, was, led, by, preachers, such, as, jonathan, edwards, and, george, whitefield, american, evangelicals, affected, by, the, awakening, added, a, new, emphasis, on, divine, outpourings, of, the, holy, spirit, and, conversions, that, implanted, new, believers, with, an, intense, love, for, god, revivals, encapsulated, those, hallmarks, and, carried, the, newly, created, evangelicalism, into, the, early, republic, setting, the, stage, for, the, second, great, awakening, in, the, late, 1790s, in, the, early, stages, evangelicals, in, the, south, such, as, methodists, and, baptists, preached, for, religious, freedom, and, abolition, of, slavery, they, converted, many, slaves, and, recognized, some, as, preachers, each, of, the, 13, american, colonies, had, a, slightly, different, governmental, structure, typically, a, colony, was, ruled, by, a, governor, appointed, from, london, who, controlled, the, executive, administration, and, relied, upon, a, locally, elected, legislature, to, vote, on, taxes, and, make, laws, by, the, 18th, century, the, american, colonies, were, growing, very, rapidly, as, a, result, of, low, death, rates, along, with, ample, supplies, of, land, and, food, the, colonies, were, richer, than, most, parts, of, britain, and, attracted, a, steady, flow, of, immigrants, especially, teenagers, who, arrived, as, indentured, servants, over, half, of, all, european, immigrants, to, colonial, america, arrived, as, indentured, servants, few, could, afford, the, cost, of, the, journey, to, america, and, so, this, form, of, unfree, labor, provided, a, means, to, immigrate, typically, people, would, sign, a, contract, agreeing, to, a, set, term, of, labor, usually, four, to, seven, years, and, in, return, would, receive, transport, to, america, and, a, piece, of, land, at, the, end, of, their, servitude, in, some, cases, ships, captains, received, rewards, for, the, delivery, of, poor, migrants, and, so, extravagant, promises, and, kidnapping, were, common, the, virginia, company, and, the, massachusetts, bay, company, also, used, indentured, servant, labor, the, first, african, slaves, were, brought, to, virginia, in, 1619, just, twelve, years, after, the, founding, of, jamestown, initially, regarded, as, indentured, servants, who, could, buy, their, freedom, the, institution, of, slavery, began, to, harden, and, the, involuntary, servitude, became, lifelong, as, the, demand, for, labor, on, tobacco, and, rice, plantations, grew, in, the, 1660s, slavery, became, identified, with, brown, skin, color, at, the, time, seen, as, a, black, race, and, the, children, of, slave, women, were, born, slaves, partus, sequitur, ventrem, by, the, 1770s, african, slaves, comprised, a, fifth, of, the, american, population, the, question, of, independence, from, britain, did, not, arise, as, long, as, the, colonies, needed, british, military, support, against, the, french, and, spanish, powers, those, threats, were, gone, by, 1765, however, london, continued, to, regard, the, american, colonies, as, existing, for, the, benefit, of, the, mother, country, in, a, policy, known, as, mercantilism, colonial, america, was, defined, by, a, severe, labor, shortage, that, used, forms, of, unfree, labor, such, as, slavery, and, indentured, servitude, the, british, colonies, were, also, marked, by, a, policy, of, avoiding, strict, enforcement, of, parliamentary, laws, known, as, salutary, neglect, this, permitted, the, development, of, an, american, spirit, distinct, from, that, of, its, european, founders, an, upper, class, emerged, in, south, carolina, and, virginia, with, wealth, based, on, large, plantations, operated, by, slave, labor, a, unique, class, system, operated, in, upstate, new, york, where, dutch, tenant, farmers, rented, land, from, very, wealthy, dutch, proprietors, such, as, the, van, rensselaer, family, the, other, colonies, were, more, egalitarian, with, pennsylvania, being, representative, by, the, mid, 18th, century, pennsylvania, was, basically, a, middle, class, colony, with, limited, respect, for, its, small, upper, class, the, french, and, indian, war, 1754, 1763, part, of, the, larger, seven, years, war, was, a, watershed, event, in, the, political, development, of, the, colonies, the, influence, of, the, french, and, native, americans, the, main, rivals, of, the, british, crown, in, the, colonies, and, canada, was, significantly, reduced, and, the, territory, of, the, thirteen, colonies, expanded, into, new, france, both, in, canada, and, louisiana, the, war, effort, also, resulted, in, greater, political, integration, of, the, colonies, as, reflected, in, the, albany, congress, and, symbolized, by, benjamin, franklin, s, call, for, the, colonies, to, join, or, die, franklin, was, a, man, of, many, inventions, one, of, which, was, the, concept, of, a, united, states, of, america, which, emerged, after, 1765, and, would, be, realized, a, decade, later, following, britain, s, acquisition, of, french, territory, in, north, america, king, george, iii, issued, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, to, organize, the, new, north, american, empire, and, protect, the, native, americans, from, colonial, expansion, into, western, lands, beyond, the, appalachian, mountains, in, the, following, years, strains, developed, in, the, relations, between, the, colonists, and, the, crown, the, british, parliament, passed, the, stamp, act, of, 1765, imposing, a, tax, on, the, colonies, without, going, through, the, colonial, legislatures, the, issue, was, drawn, did, parliament, have, the, right, to, tax, americans, who, were, not, represented, in, it, crying, no, taxation, without, representation, the, colonists, refused, to, pay, the, taxes, as, tensions, escalated, in, the, late, 1760s, and, early, 1770s, the, boston, tea, party, in, 1773, was, a, direct, action, by, activists, in, the, town, of, boston, to, protest, against, the, new, tax, on, tea, parliament, quickly, responded, the, next, year, with, the, intolerable, acts, stripping, massachusetts, of, its, historic, right, of, self, government, and, putting, it, under, military, rule, which, sparked, outrage, and, resistance, in, all, thirteen, colonies, patriot, leaders, from, every, colony, convened, the, first, continental, congress, to, coordinate, their, resistance, to, the, intolerable, acts, the, congress, called, for, a, boycott, of, british, trade, published, a, list, of, rights, and, grievances, and, petitioned, the, king, to, rectify, those, grievances, this, appeal, to, the, crown, had, no, effect, though, and, so, the, second, continental, congress, was, convened, in, 1775, to, organize, the, defence, of, the, colonies, against, the, british, army, common, people, became, insurgents, against, the, british, even, though, they, were, unfamiliar, with, the, ideological, rationales, being, offered, they, held, very, strongly, a, sense, of, rights, that, they, felt, the, british, were, deliberately, violating, rights, that, stressed, local, autonomy, fair, dealing, and, government, by, consent, they, were, highly, sensitive, to, the, issue, of, tyranny, which, they, saw, manifested, by, the, arrival, in, boston, of, the, british, army, to, punish, the, bostonians, this, heightened, their, sense, of, violated, rights, leading, to, rage, and, demands, for, revenge, and, they, had, faith, that, god, was, on, their, side, the, second, continental, congress, voted, to, declare, independence, on, july, 2, 1776, and, the, declaration, of, independence, was, drafted, by, the, committee, of, five, the, declaration, of, independence, presented, arguments, in, favor, of, the, rights, of, citizens, stating, that, all, men, are, created, equal, supporting, the, rights, of, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, and, demanding, the, consent, of, the, governed, it, also, listed, grievances, against, the, crown, the, founding, fathers, were, guided, by, the, ideology, of, republicanism, rejecting, the, monarchism, of, great, britain, the, declaration, of, independence, was, signed, by, members, of, the, congress, on, july, 4, this, date, has, since, been, commemorated, as, independence, day, the, american, revolutionary, war, began, with, the, battles, of, lexington, and, concord, when, american, and, british, forces, clashed, on, april, 19, 1775, george, washington, was, appointed, general, of, the, continental, army, the, new, york, and, new, jersey, campaign, was, the, first, major, campaign, of, the, war, beginning, in, 1776, washington, s, crossing, of, the, delaware, river, began, a, series, of, victories, that, expelled, british, forces, from, new, jersey, the, british, began, the, saratoga, campaign, in, 1777, to, capture, albany, new, york, as, a, choke, point, after, american, victory, at, saratoga, france, the, netherlands, and, spain, began, providing, support, to, the, continental, army, britain, responded, to, defeat, in, the, northern, theater, by, advancing, in, the, southern, theater, beginning, with, the, capture, of, savannah, in, 1778, american, forces, reclaimed, the, south, in, 1781, and, the, british, army, was, defeated, in, the, siege, of, yorktown, on, october, 19, 1781, king, george, iii, formally, ordered, the, end, of, hostilities, on, december, 5, 1782, recognizing, american, independence, the, treaty, of, paris, was, negotiated, between, great, britain, and, the, united, states, to, establish, terms, of, peace, it, was, signed, on, september, 3, 1783, and, it, was, ratified, by, the, congress, of, the, confederation, on, january, 14, 1784, washington, resigned, his, commission, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, continental, army, on, december, 23, 1783, the, articles, of, confederation, were, ratified, as, the, governing, law, of, the, united, states, written, to, limit, the, powers, of, the, central, government, in, favor, of, state, governments, this, caused, economic, decline, as, the, government, was, unable, to, pass, economic, legislation, and, pay, its, debts, nationalists, worried, that, the, confederate, nature, of, the, union, was, too, fragile, to, withstand, an, armed, conflict, with, any, adversarial, states, or, even, internal, revolts, such, as, the, shays, rebellion, of, 1786, in, massachusetts, in, the, 1780s, the, national, government, was, able, to, settle, the, issue, of, the, western, regions, of, the, young, united, states, which, were, ceded, by, the, states, to, congress, and, became, territories, with, the, migration, of, settlers, to, the, northwest, soon, they, became, states, the, american, indian, wars, continued, in, the, 1780s, as, settlers, moved, west, prompting, native, american, attacks, on, american, civilians, and, in, turn, prompting, american, attacks, on, native, american, civilians, the, northwestern, confederacy, and, american, settlers, began, fighting, the, northwest, indian, war, in, the, late, 1780s, the, northwestern, confederacy, received, british, support, but, the, settlers, received, little, assistance, from, the, american, government, nationalists, most, of, them, war, veterans, organized, in, every, state, and, convinced, congress, to, call, the, philadelphia, convention, in, 1787, the, delegates, from, every, state, wrote, a, new, constitution, that, created, a, federal, government, with, a, strong, president, and, powers, of, taxation, the, new, government, reflected, the, prevailing, republican, ideals, of, guarantees, of, individual, liberty, and, of, constraining, the, power, of, government, through, a, system, of, separation, of, powers, a, national, debate, took, place, over, whether, the, constitution, should, be, ratified, and, it, was, ratified, by, a, sufficient, number, of, states, in, 1788, to, begin, forming, a, federal, government, the, united, states, electoral, college, chose, george, washington, as, the, first, president, of, the, united, states, in, 1789, george, washington, became, the, first, president, of, the, united, states, under, the, new, constitution, in, 1789, the, national, capital, moved, from, new, york, to, philadelphia, in, 1790, and, finally, settled, in, washington, d, c, in, 1800, the, major, accomplishment, of, the, washington, administration, was, creating, a, strong, national, government, that, was, recognized, without, question, by, all, americans, his, government, following, the, vigorous, leadership, of, treasury, secretary, alexander, hamilton, assumed, the, debts, of, the, states, the, debt, holders, received, federal, bonds, created, the, bank, of, the, united, states, to, stabilize, the, financial, system, and, set, up, a, uniform, system, of, tariffs, taxes, on, imports, and, other, taxes, to, pay, off, the, debt, and, provide, a, financial, infrastructure, to, support, his, programs, hamilton, created, a, new, political, party, the, first, in, the, world, based, on, voters, the, federalist, party, to, assuage, the, anti, federalists, who, feared, a, too, powerful, central, government, the, congress, adopted, the, united, states, bill, of, rights, in, 1791, comprising, the, first, ten, amendments, of, the, constitution, it, guaranteed, individual, liberties, such, as, freedom, of, speech, and, religious, practice, jury, trials, and, stated, that, citizens, and, states, had, reserved, rights, which, were, not, specified, thomas, jefferson, and, james, madison, formed, an, opposition, republican, party, usually, called, the, democratic, republican, party, by, political, scientists, hamilton, and, washington, presented, the, country, in, 1794, with, the, jay, treaty, that, reestablished, good, relations, with, britain, the, jeffersonians, vehemently, protested, and, the, voters, aligned, behind, one, party, or, the, other, thus, setting, up, the, first, party, system, federalists, promoted, business, financial, and, commercial, interests, and, wanted, more, trade, with, britain, republicans, accused, the, federalists, of, plans, to, establish, a, monarchy, turn, the, rich, into, a, ruling, class, and, making, the, united, states, a, pawn, of, the, british, the, treaty, passed, but, politics, became, intensely, heated, serious, challenges, to, the, new, federal, government, included, the, northwest, indian, war, the, ongoing, cherokee, american, wars, and, the, 1794, whiskey, rebellion, in, which, western, settlers, protested, against, a, federal, tax, on, liquor, washington, called, the, state, militia, and, personally, led, an, army, against, the, settlers, as, the, insurgents, melted, away, and, the, power, of, the, federal, government, was, firmly, established, washington, refused, to, serve, more, than, two, terms, setting, a, precedent, and, in, his, famous, farewell, address, he, extolled, the, benefits, of, federal, government, and, importance, of, ethics, and, morality, while, warning, against, foreign, alliances, and, the, formation, of, political, parties, john, adams, a, federalist, defeated, jefferson, in, the, 1796, election, war, loomed, with, france, and, the, federalists, used, the, opportunity, to, try, to, silence, the, republicans, with, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, build, up, a, large, army, with, hamilton, at, the, head, and, prepare, for, a, french, invasion, however, the, federalists, became, divided, after, adams, sent, a, successful, peace, mission, to, france, that, ended, the, quasi, war, of, 1798, during, the, first, two, decades, after, the, revolutionary, war, there, were, dramatic, changes, in, the, status, of, slavery, among, the, states, and, an, increase, in, the, number, of, freed, blacks, inspired, by, revolutionary, ideals, of, the, equality, of, men, and, influenced, by, their, lesser, economic, reliance, on, slavery, northern, states, abolished, slavery, states, of, the, upper, south, made, manumission, easier, resulting, in, an, increase, in, the, proportion, of, free, blacks, in, the, upper, south, as, a, percentage, of, the, total, non, white, population, from, less, than, one, percent, in, 1792, to, more, than, 10, percent, by, 1810, by, that, date, a, total, of, 13, 5, percent, of, all, blacks, in, the, united, states, were, free, after, that, date, with, the, demand, for, slaves, on, the, rise, because, of, the, deep, south, s, expanding, cotton, cultivation, the, number, of, manumissions, declined, sharply, and, an, internal, u, s, slave, trade, became, an, important, source, of, wealth, for, many, planters, and, traders, in, 1807, with, four, million, slaves, already, in, the, united, states, congress, severed, the, u, s, s, involvement, with, the, atlantic, slave, trade, for, 50, of, the, country, s, first, 72, years, a, slaveholder, served, as, president, and, during, that, period, only, slaveholding, presidents, were, re, elected, to, second, terms, the, second, great, awakening, was, a, protestant, revival, movement, that, affected, virtually, all, of, society, during, the, early, 19th, century, and, led, to, rapid, church, growth, the, movement, began, around, 1790, gained, momentum, by, 1800, and, after, 1820, membership, rose, rapidly, among, baptist, and, methodist, congregations, whose, preachers, led, the, movement, it, was, past, its, peak, by, the, 1840s, it, enrolled, millions, of, new, members, in, existing, evangelical, denominations, and, led, to, the, formation, of, new, denominations, many, converts, believed, that, the, awakening, heralded, a, new, millennial, age, the, second, great, awakening, stimulated, the, establishment, of, many, reform, movements, including, abolitionism, and, temperance, designed, to, remove, the, evils, of, society, before, the, anticipated, second, coming, of, jesus, christ, jefferson, defeated, adams, massively, for, the, presidency, in, the, 1800, election, jefferson, s, major, achievement, as, president, was, the, louisiana, purchase, in, 1803, which, provided, u, s, settlers, with, vast, potential, for, expansion, west, of, the, mississippi, river, jefferson, a, scientist, supported, expeditions, to, explore, and, map, the, new, domain, most, notably, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, jefferson, believed, deeply, in, republicanism, and, argued, it, should, be, based, on, the, independent, yeoman, farmer, and, planter, he, distrusted, cities, factories, and, banks, he, also, distrusted, the, federal, government, and, judges, and, tried, to, weaken, the, judiciary, however, he, met, his, match, in, john, marshall, a, federalist, from, virginia, although, the, constitution, specified, a, supreme, court, its, functions, were, vague, until, marshall, the, chief, justice, of, the, united, states, 1801, 1835, defined, them, especially, the, power, to, overturn, acts, of, congress, or, states, that, violated, the, constitution, first, enunciated, in, 1803, in, marbury, v, madison, americans, were, increasingly, angry, at, the, british, violation, of, american, ships, neutral, rights, to, hurt, france, the, impressment, seizure, of, 10, 000, american, sailors, needed, by, the, royal, navy, to, fight, napoleon, and, british, support, for, hostile, indians, attacking, american, settlers, in, the, american, midwest, with, the, goal, of, creating, a, pro, british, indian, barrier, state, to, block, american, expansion, westward, they, may, also, have, desired, to, annex, all, or, part, of, british, north, america, although, this, is, still, heavily, debated, despite, strong, opposition, from, the, northeast, especially, from, federalists, who, did, not, want, to, disrupt, trade, with, britain, congress, declared, war, on, june, 18, 1812, the, war, was, frustrating, for, both, sides, both, sides, tried, to, invade, the, other, and, were, repulsed, the, american, high, command, remained, incompetent, until, the, last, year, the, american, militia, proved, ineffective, because, the, soldiers, were, reluctant, to, leave, home, and, efforts, to, invade, canada, repeatedly, failed, the, british, blockade, ruined, american, commerce, bankrupted, the, treasury, and, further, angered, new, englanders, who, smuggled, supplies, to, britain, the, americans, under, general, william, henry, harrison, finally, gained, naval, control, of, lake, erie, and, defeated, the, indians, under, tecumseh, in, canada, while, andrew, jackson, ended, the, indian, threat, in, the, southeast, the, indian, threat, to, expansion, into, the, midwest, was, permanently, ended, the, british, invaded, and, occupied, much, of, maine, the, british, raided, and, burned, washington, but, were, repelled, at, baltimore, in, 1814, where, the, star, spangled, banner, was, written, to, celebrate, the, american, success, in, upstate, new, york, a, major, british, invasion, of, new, york, state, was, turned, back, at, the, battle, of, plattsburgh, finally, in, early, 1815, andrew, jackson, decisively, defeated, a, major, british, invasion, at, the, battle, of, new, orleans, making, him, the, most, famous, war, hero, with, napoleon, apparently, gone, the, causes, of, the, war, had, evaporated, and, both, sides, agreed, to, a, peace, that, left, the, prewar, boundaries, intact, americans, claimed, victory, on, february, 18, 1815, as, news, came, almost, simultaneously, of, jackson, s, victory, of, new, orleans, and, the, peace, treaty, that, left, the, prewar, boundaries, in, place, americans, swelled, with, pride, at, success, in, the, second, war, of, independence, the, naysayers, of, the, antiwar, federalist, party, were, put, to, shame, and, the, party, never, recovered, this, helped, lead, to, an, emerging, american, identity, that, cemented, national, pride, over, state, pride, britain, never, achieved, the, war, goal, of, granting, the, indians, a, barrier, state, to, block, further, american, settlement, and, this, allowed, settlers, to, pour, into, the, midwest, without, fear, of, a, major, threat, the, war, of, 1812, also, destroyed, america, s, negative, perception, of, a, standing, army, which, had, proven, useful, in, many, areas, against, the, british, as, opposed, to, ill, equipped, and, poorly, trained, militias, in, the, early, months, of, the, war, and, war, department, officials, instead, decided, to, place, regular, troops, as, the, main, military, capabilities, of, the, government, as, strong, opponents, of, the, war, of, 1812, the, federalists, held, the, hartford, convention, in, 1814, that, hinted, at, disunion, national, euphoria, after, the, victory, at, new, orleans, ruined, the, prestige, of, the, federalists, and, they, no, longer, played, a, significant, role, as, a, political, party, president, madison, and, most, republicans, realized, they, were, foolish, to, let, the, first, bank, of, the, united, states, close, down, for, its, absence, greatly, hindered, the, financing, of, the, war, so, with, the, assistance, of, foreign, bankers, they, chartered, the, second, bank, of, the, united, states, in, 1816, the, republicans, also, imposed, tariffs, designed, to, protect, the, infant, industries, that, had, been, created, when, britain, was, blockading, the, u, s, with, the, collapse, of, the, federalists, as, a, party, the, adoption, of, many, federalist, principles, by, the, republicans, and, the, systematic, policy, of, president, james, monroe, in, his, two, terms, 1817, 1825, to, downplay, partisanship, society, entered, an, era, of, good, feelings, with, far, less, partisanship, than, before, or, after, and, closed, out, the, first, party, system, the, monroe, doctrine, expressed, in, 1823, proclaimed, the, united, states, opinion, that, european, powers, should, no, longer, colonize, or, interfere, in, the, americas, this, was, a, defining, moment, in, the, foreign, policy, of, the, united, states, the, monroe, doctrine, was, adopted, in, response, to, american, and, british, fears, over, russian, and, french, expansion, into, the, western, hemisphere, in, 1832, president, andrew, jackson, 7th, president, of, the, united, states, ran, for, a, second, term, under, the, slogan, jackson, and, no, bank, and, did, not, renew, the, charter, of, the, second, bank, dissolving, the, bank, in, 1836, jackson, was, convinced, that, central, banking, was, used, by, the, elite, to, take, advantage, of, the, average, american, and, instead, implemented, publicly, owned, banks, in, various, states, popularly, known, as, pet, banks, after, the, first, party, system, of, federalists, and, republicans, withered, away, in, the, 1820s, the, stage, was, set, for, the, emergence, of, a, new, party, system, based, on, well, organized, local, parties, that, appealed, for, the, votes, of, almost, all, adult, white, men, the, former, jeffersonian, democratic, republican, party, split, into, factions, they, split, over, the, choice, of, a, successor, to, president, james, monroe, and, the, party, faction, that, supported, many, of, the, old, jeffersonian, principles, led, by, andrew, jackson, and, martin, van, buren, became, the, democratic, party, as, norton, explains, the, transformation, in, 1828, jacksonians, believed, the, people, s, will, had, finally, prevailed, through, a, lavishly, financed, coalition, of, state, parties, political, leaders, and, newspaper, editors, a, popular, movement, had, elected, the, president, the, democrats, became, the, nation, s, first, well, organized, national, party, and, tight, party, organization, became, the, hallmark, of, nineteenth, century, american, politics, opposing, factions, led, by, henry, clay, helped, form, the, whig, party, the, democratic, party, had, a, small, but, decisive, advantage, over, the, whigs, until, the, 1850s, when, the, whigs, fell, apart, over, the, issue, of, slavery, the, american, colonies, and, the, newly, formed, union, grew, rapidly, in, population, and, area, as, pioneers, pushed, the, frontier, of, settlement, west, the, process, finally, ended, around, 1890, 1912, as, the, last, major, farmlands, and, ranch, lands, were, settled, native, american, tribes, in, some, places, resisted, militarily, but, they, were, overwhelmed, by, settlers, and, the, army, and, after, 1830, were, relocated, to, reservations, in, the, west, that, year, congress, passed, the, indian, removal, act, which, authorized, the, president, to, negotiate, treaties, that, exchanged, native, american, tribal, lands, in, the, eastern, states, for, lands, west, of, the, mississippi, river, its, goal, was, primarily, to, remove, native, americans, including, the, five, civilized, tribes, from, the, american, southeast, they, occupied, land, that, settlers, wanted, jacksonian, democrats, demanded, the, forcible, removal, of, native, populations, who, refused, to, acknowledge, state, laws, to, reservations, in, the, west, whigs, and, religious, leaders, opposed, the, move, as, inhumane, thousands, of, deaths, resulted, from, the, relocations, as, seen, in, the, cherokee, trail, of, tears, the, trail, of, tears, resulted, in, approximately, 2, 000, to, 8, 000, of, the, 16, 543, relocated, cherokee, dying, along, the, way, many, of, the, seminole, indians, in, florida, refused, to, move, west, and, fought, the, army, for, years, in, the, seminole, wars, the, first, settlers, in, the, west, were, the, spanish, in, new, mexico, californios, followed, by, over, 100, 000, california, gold, rush, miners, 49ers, california, grew, rapidly, and, by, 1880, san, francisco, had, become, the, economic, hub, of, the, entire, pacific, coast, with, a, diverse, population, of, a, quarter, million, from, the, early, 1830s, to, 1869, the, oregon, trail, and, its, many, offshoots, were, used, by, over, 300, 000, settlers, 49ers, ranchers, farmers, entrepreneurs, and, their, families, headed, to, california, oregon, and, other, points, in, the, far, west, wagon, trains, took, five, or, six, months, on, foot, manifest, destiny, was, the, belief, that, american, settlers, were, destined, to, expand, across, the, continent, this, concept, was, born, out, of, a, sense, of, mission, to, redeem, the, old, world, by, high, example, generated, by, the, potentialities, of, a, new, earth, for, building, a, new, heaven, manifest, destiny, was, rejected, by, modernizers, especially, the, whigs, like, henry, clay, and, abraham, lincoln, who, wanted, to, build, cities, and, factories, not, more, farms, democrats, strongly, favored, expansion, and, won, the, key, election, of, 1844, after, a, bitter, debate, in, congress, the, republic, of, texas, was, annexed, in, 1845, leading, to, war, with, mexico, who, considered, texas, to, be, a, part, of, mexico, due, to, the, large, numbers, of, mexican, settlers, the, mexican, american, war, broke, out, in, 1846, with, the, whigs, opposed, to, the, war, and, the, democrats, supporting, it, the, u, s, army, using, regulars, and, large, numbers, of, volunteers, defeated, the, mexican, armies, invaded, at, several, points, captured, mexico, city, and, won, decisively, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, ended, the, war, in, 1848, many, democrats, wanted, to, annex, all, of, mexico, but, that, idea, was, rejected, by, white, southerners, who, argued, that, by, incorporating, millions, of, mexican, people, mainly, of, mixed, race, would, undermine, the, u, s, as, an, exclusively, white, republic, instead, the, u, s, took, texas, and, the, lightly, settled, northern, parts, california, and, new, mexico, the, hispanic, residents, were, given, full, citizenship, and, the, mexican, indians, became, american, indians, simultaneously, gold, was, discovered, in, california, in, 1848, to, clear, the, state, for, settlers, the, u, s, government, began, a, policy, of, extermination, since, termed, the, california, genocide, a, peaceful, compromise, with, britain, gave, the, u, s, ownership, of, the, oregon, country, which, was, renamed, the, oregon, territory, the, demand, for, guano, prized, as, an, agricultural, fertilizer, led, the, u, s, to, pass, the, guano, islands, act, in, 1856, which, enabled, u, s, citizens, to, take, possession, in, the, name, of, the, country, of, unclaimed, islands, containing, guano, deposits, under, the, act, the, u, s, annexed, nearly, 100, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, and, the, caribbean, sea, by, 1903, 66, of, these, islands, were, recognized, as, territories, of, the, united, states, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, began, with, the, 1848, national, convention, of, the, liberty, party, presidential, candidate, gerrit, smith, argued, for, and, established, women, s, suffrage, as, a, party, goal, one, month, later, the, seneca, falls, convention, was, organized, signing, the, declaration, of, sentiments, demanding, equal, rights, for, women, including, the, right, to, vote, many, of, these, activists, became, politically, aware, during, the, abolitionist, movement, the, women, s, rights, campaign, during, first, wave, feminism, was, led, by, elizabeth, cady, stanton, lucy, stone, and, susan, b, anthony, among, others, stone, and, paulina, wright, davis, organized, the, prominent, and, influential, national, women, s, rights, convention, in, 1850, the, central, issue, after, 1848, was, the, expansion, of, slavery, with, the, anti, slavery, elements, in, the, north, pitted, against, the, pro, slavery, elements, in, the, south, by, 1860, there, were, four, million, slaves, in, the, south, nearly, eight, times, as, many, as, there, were, nationwide, in, 1790, a, small, number, of, active, northerners, were, abolitionists, who, followed, william, lloyd, garrison, and, declared, that, ownership, of, slaves, was, a, sin, and, demanded, its, immediate, abolition, much, larger, numbers, in, the, north, were, against, the, expansion, of, slavery, seeking, to, put, it, on, the, path, to, extinction, so, that, america, would, be, committed, to, free, land, as, in, low, cost, farms, owned, and, cultivated, by, a, family, free, labor, and, free, speech, as, opposed, to, censorship, of, abolitionist, material, in, the, south, however, before, 1860, only, a, minority, of, northern, white, people, supported, abolition, which, was, often, seen, as, a, radical, measure, there, were, violent, reactions, to, abolitionist, advocates, in, the, north, notably, the, burning, of, an, anti, slavery, society, in, pennsylvania, hall, there, was, resistance, to, slavery, by, both, peaceful, and, violent, means, slave, rebellions, by, gabriel, prosser, 1800, denmark, vesey, 1822, nat, turner, 1831, and, john, brown, 1859, caused, fear, in, the, white, south, which, imposed, stricter, oversight, of, slaves, and, reduced, the, rights, of, free, black, people, former, slaves, frederick, douglass, and, harriet, tubman, became, leading, advocates, for, abolition, the, issue, was, discussed, in, the, best, selling, anti, slavery, novel, uncle, tom, s, cabin, by, harriet, beecher, stowe, southern, white, democrats, insisted, that, slavery, was, of, economic, social, and, cultural, benefit, to, all, white, people, and, even, to, the, slaves, themselves, justifications, of, slavery, included, history, religion, legality, social, good, and, economics, defenders, argued, that, the, sudden, end, to, the, slave, economy, would, have, had, a, fatal, economic, impact, in, the, south, and, there, would, be, widespread, unemployment, and, chaos, slave, labor, was, the, foundation, of, their, economy, southern, slavery, based, societies, had, become, wealthy, based, on, their, cotton, and, other, agricultural, commodity, production, as, well, as, the, internal, slave, trade, the, plantations, were, highly, profitable, due, to, the, heavy, european, demand, for, raw, cotton, northern, cities, and, regional, industries, were, tied, economically, to, slavery, by, banking, shipping, and, manufacturing, including, textile, mills, in, addition, southern, states, benefited, by, their, increased, apportionment, in, congress, due, to, the, partial, counting, of, slaves, in, their, populations, religious, activists, were, split, on, slavery, with, the, methodists, and, baptists, dividing, into, northern, and, southern, denominations, in, the, north, the, methodists, congregationalists, and, quakers, included, many, abolitionists, especially, among, women, activists, the, catholic, episcopal, and, lutheran, denominations, largely, ignored, the, issue, the, issue, of, slavery, in, the, new, territories, was, seemingly, settled, by, the, compromise, of, 1850, brokered, by, whig, henry, clay, and, democrat, stephen, douglas, the, compromise, included, the, admission, of, california, as, a, free, state, in, exchange, for, no, federal, restrictions, on, slavery, placed, on, utah, or, new, mexico, a, point, of, contention, was, the, fugitive, slave, act, which, required, the, states, to, cooperate, with, slave, owners, when, attempting, to, recover, escaped, slaves, formerly, an, escaped, slave, that, reached, a, non, slave, state, was, presumed, to, have, attained, sanctuary, and, freedom, under, the, missouri, compromise, the, compromise, of, 1820, was, repealed, in, 1854, with, the, kansas, nebraska, act, promoted, by, stephen, douglas, in, the, name, of, popular, sovereignty, and, democracy, it, permitted, voters, to, decide, on, the, legality, of, slavery, in, each, territory, and, allowed, douglas, to, adopt, neutrality, on, the, issue, of, slavery, anti, slavery, forces, rose, in, anger, and, alarm, forming, the, new, republican, party, pro, and, anti, contingents, rushed, to, kansas, to, vote, for, or, against, slavery, resulting, in, a, miniature, civil, war, called, bleeding, kansas, by, the, late, 1850s, the, young, republican, party, dominated, nearly, all, northern, states, and, thus, the, electoral, college, it, insisted, that, slavery, would, never, be, allowed, to, expand, and, thus, would, slowly, die, out, the, supreme, court, s, 1857, decision, in, dred, scott, v, sandford, ruled, that, the, compromise, was, unconstitutional, and, that, free, black, people, were, not, u, s, citizens, the, decision, enraged, northerners, the, republicans, worried, the, decision, could, be, used, to, expand, slavery, throughout, all, states, and, territories, with, senator, abraham, lincoln, leading, criticism, of, the, ruling, the, stage, was, set, for, the, 1860, presidential, election, after, abraham, lincoln, won, the, 1860, election, seven, southern, states, seceded, from, the, union, and, formed, a, sovereign, state, the, confederate, states, of, america, confederacy, on, february, 8, 1861, the, civil, war, began, on, april, 12, 1861, when, confederate, forces, attacked, a, u, s, military, installation, at, fort, sumter, in, south, carolina, in, response, lincoln, called, on, the, states, to, send, troops, to, recapture, forts, protect, washington, d, c, and, preserve, the, union, which, in, his, view, still, existed, despite, the, secession, lincoln, s, call, led, to, four, more, states, seceding, and, joining, the, confederacy, a, few, of, the, northernmost, slave, states, did, not, secede, and, became, known, as, the, border, states, these, were, delaware, maryland, kentucky, and, missouri, during, the, war, the, northwestern, portion, of, virginia, seceded, from, the, confederacy, which, became, the, new, union, state, of, west, virginia, the, two, armies, first, major, battle, was, the, first, battle, of, bull, run, which, proved, to, both, sides, that, the, war, would, be, much, longer, than, anticipated, in, the, western, theater, the, union, army, was, relatively, successful, with, major, battles, such, as, perryville, and, shiloh, along, with, union, navy, gunboat, dominance, of, navigable, rivers, producing, strategic, union, victories, and, destroying, major, confederate, operations, warfare, in, the, eastern, theater, began, poorly, for, the, union, u, s, general, george, b, mcclellan, failed, to, capture, the, confederate, capital, of, richmond, virginia, in, his, peninsula, campaign, and, retreated, after, attacks, from, confederate, general, robert, e, lee, meanwhile, in, 1861, and, 1862, both, sides, concentrated, on, raising, and, training, new, armies, the, union, successfully, gained, control, the, border, states, driving, the, confederates, out, the, autumn, 1862, confederate, retreat, at, the, battle, of, antietam, led, to, lincoln, s, warning, he, would, issue, the, emancipation, proclamation, in, january, 1863, if, the, states, did, not, return, making, slavery, a, central, war, goal, energized, northern, republicans, as, well, as, their, enemies, the, anti, war, copperhead, democrats, it, ended, the, chance, of, british, and, french, intervention, lee, s, smaller, army, of, northern, virginia, won, battles, in, late, 1862, and, spring, 1863, but, he, pushed, too, hard, and, ignored, the, union, threat, in, the, west, he, invaded, pennsylvania, in, search, of, supplies, and, to, cause, war, weariness, in, the, north, the, emancipation, proclamation, was, an, executive, order, issued, by, lincoln, on, january, 1, 1863, it, freed, 3, million, slaves, in, designated, areas, of, the, confederacy, the, owners, were, not, compensated, plantation, owners, realizing, that, emancipation, would, destroy, their, economic, system, sometimes, moved, their, slaves, as, far, as, possible, from, the, union, army, in, perhaps, the, turning, point, of, the, war, lee, s, army, was, badly, beaten, by, the, army, of, the, potomac, at, the, july, 1863, battle, of, gettysburg, and, barely, made, it, back, to, virginia, survivors, of, the, battle, were, immediately, redeployed, to, suppress, the, new, york, city, draft, riots, by, irish, americans, protesting, civil, war, conscription, and, the, city, s, free, black, population, in, july, 1863, union, forces, under, general, ulysses, s, grant, gained, control, of, the, mississippi, river, at, the, battle, of, vicksburg, thereby, splitting, the, confederacy, in, 1864, union, general, william, tecumseh, sherman, marched, south, from, chattanooga, to, capture, atlanta, a, decisive, victory, that, ended, war, jitters, among, republicans, in, the, north, and, helped, lincoln, win, re, election, the, civil, war, was, the, world, s, earliest, industrial, war,

handful, of, runs, sherman, s, march, to, the, sea, was, almost, unopposed, and, demonstrated, that, the, south, was, unable, to, resist, a, union, invasion, much, of, the, south, was, destroyed, and, could, no, longer, provide, desperately, needed, supplies, to, its, armies, in, spring, 1864, grant, launched, a, war, of, attrition, and, pursued, lee, to, the, final, appomattox, campaign, which, resulted, in, lee, surrendering, in, april, 1865, by, june, 1865, the, union, army, controlled, all, of, the, confederacy, and, liberated, all, of, the, designated, slaves, it, remains, the, deadliest, war, in, american, history, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, about, 750, 000, soldiers, and, an, undetermined, number, of, civilian, casualties, about, ten, percent, of, all, northern,
