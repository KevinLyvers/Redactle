before, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, the, lands, that, now, constitute, brazil, were, occupied, fought, over, and, settled, by, diverse, tribes, thus, the, history, of, brazil, begins, with, the, indigenous, people, in, brazil, the, portuguese, arrived, to, the, land, that, would, become, brazil, on, april, 22, 1500, commanded, by, pedro, lvares, cabral, an, explorer, on, his, way, to, india, under, the, sponsorship, of, the, kingdom, of, portugal, and, the, support, of, the, catholic, church, from, the, 16th, to, the, early, 19th, century, brazil, was, created, and, expanded, as, a, colony, kingdom, and, an, integral, part, of, the, portuguese, empire, brazil, was, briefly, named, land, of, the, holy, cross, by, portuguese, explorers, and, crusaders, before, being, named, land, of, brazil, by, the, brazilian, portuguese, settlers, and, merchants, dealing, with, brazilwood, the, country, expanded, south, along, the, coast, and, west, along, the, amazon, and, other, inland, rivers, from, the, original, 15, hereditary, captaincy, colonies, established, on, the, northeast, atlantic, coast, east, of, the, tordesillas, line, of, 1494, that, divided, the, portuguese, domain, to, the, east, from, the, spanish, domain, to, the, west, the, country, s, borders, were, only, finalized, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, most, of, the, expansion, occurring, before, the, independence, resulting, in, the, largest, contiguous, territory, in, the, americas, on, september, 7, 1822, prince, regent, pedro, de, alc, ntara, declared, brazil, s, independence, from, portugal, and, so, the, kingdom, of, brazil, became, the, empire, of, brazil, the, country, became, a, dictatorial, republic, in, 1889, following, a, military, coup, d, tat, an, authoritarian, military, junta, came, to, power, in, 1964, and, ruled, until, 1985, after, which, civilian, governance, and, democracy, resumed, brazil, is, a, democratic, federal, republic, due, to, its, rich, culture, and, history, the, country, ranks, thirteenth, in, the, world, by, number, of, unesco, world, heritage, sites, brazil, is, a, founding, member, of, the, community, of, portuguese, language, countries, mercosul, united, nations, the, g20, brics, organization, of, ibero, american, states, and, the, organization, of, american, states, some, of, the, earliest, human, remains, found, in, the, americas, luzia, woman, were, found, in, the, area, of, pedro, leopoldo, minas, gerais, and, provide, evidence, of, human, habitation, going, back, at, least, 11, 000, years, when, portuguese, explorers, arrived, in, brazil, the, region, was, inhabited, by, hundreds, of, different, native, tribes, the, earliest, going, back, at, least, 10, 000, years, in, the, highlands, of, minas, gerais, the, dating, of, the, origins, of, the, first, inhabitants, who, were, called, indians, ndios, by, the, portuguese, is, still, a, matter, of, dispute, among, archaeologists, the, earliest, pottery, ever, found, in, the, western, hemisphere, radiocarbon, dated, 8, 000, years, old, has, been, excavated, in, the, amazon, basin, of, brazil, near, santar, m, providing, evidence, to, overturn, the, assumption, that, the, tropical, forest, region, was, too, poor, in, resources, to, have, supported, a, complex, prehistoric, culture, the, current, most, widely, accepted, view, of, anthropologists, linguists, and, geneticists, is, that, the, early, tribes, were, part, of, the, first, wave, of, migrant, hunters, who, came, into, the, americas, from, asia, either, by, land, across, the, bering, strait, or, by, coastal, sea, routes, along, the, pacific, or, both, the, andes, and, the, mountain, ranges, of, northern, south, america, created, a, rather, sharp, cultural, boundary, between, the, settled, agrarian, civilizations, of, the, west, coast, and, the, semi, nomadic, tribes, of, the, east, who, never, developed, written, records, or, permanent, monumental, architecture, for, this, reason, very, little, is, known, about, the, history, of, brazil, before, 1500, archaeological, remains, mainly, pottery, indicate, a, complex, pattern, of, regional, cultural, developments, internal, migrations, and, occasional, large, state, like, federations, at, the, time, of, european, discovery, the, territory, of, current, day, brazil, had, as, many, as, 2, 000, tribes, the, indigenous, peoples, were, traditionally, mostly, semi, nomadic, tribes, who, subsisted, on, hunting, fishing, gathering, and, migrant, agriculture, when, the, portuguese, arrived, in, 1500, the, natives, were, living, mainly, on, the, coast, and, along, the, banks, of, major, rivers, tribal, warfare, anthropophagy, and, the, pursuit, of, brazilwood, for, its, treasured, red, dye, convinced, the, portuguese, that, they, should, christianize, the, natives, but, the, portuguese, like, the, spanish, in, their, south, american, possessions, had, brought, diseases, with, them, against, which, many, natives, were, helpless, due, to, lack, of, immunity, measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, gonorrhea, and, influenza, killed, tens, of, thousands, of, indigenous, people, the, diseases, spread, quickly, along, the, indigenous, trade, routes, and, whole, tribes, were, probably, annihilated, without, ever, coming, in, direct, contact, with, europeans, marajoara, culture, flourished, on, maraj, island, at, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, river, archeologists, have, found, sophisticated, pottery, in, their, excavations, on, the, island, these, pieces, are, large, and, elaborately, painted, and, incised, with, representations, of, plants, and, animals, these, provided, the, first, evidence, that, a, complex, society, had, existed, on, maraj, evidence, of, mound, building, further, suggests, that, well, populated, complex, and, sophisticated, settlements, developed, on, this, island, as, only, such, settlements, were, believed, capable, of, such, extended, projects, as, major, earthworks, the, extent, level, of, complexity, and, resource, interactions, of, the, marajoara, culture, have, been, disputed, working, in, the, 1950s, in, some, of, her, earliest, research, american, betty, meggers, suggested, that, the, society, migrated, from, the, andes, and, settled, on, the, island, many, researchers, believed, that, the, andes, were, populated, by, paleoindian, migrants, from, north, america, who, gradually, moved, south, after, being, hunters, on, the, plains, in, the, 1980s, another, american, archeologist, anna, curtenius, roosevelt, led, excavations, and, geophysical, surveys, of, the, mound, teso, dos, bichos, she, concluded, that, the, society, that, constructed, the, mounds, originated, on, the, island, itself, the, pre, columbian, culture, of, maraj, may, have, developed, social, stratification, and, supported, a, population, as, large, as, 100, 000, people, the, native, americans, of, the, amazon, rainforest, may, have, used, their, method, of, developing, and, working, in, terra, preta, to, make, the, land, suitable, for, the, large, scale, agriculture, needed, to, support, large, populations, and, complex, social, formations, such, as, chiefdoms, the, papal, bull, inter, caetera, had, divided, the, new, world, between, spain, and, portugal, in, 1493, and, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, added, to, this, by, moving, the, dividing, line, westwards, there, are, many, theories, regarding, who, was, the, first, european, to, set, foot, on, the, land, now, called, brazil, besides, the, widely, accepted, view, of, cabral, s, discovery, some, say, that, it, was, duarte, pacheco, pereira, between, november, and, december, 1498, and, some, others, say, that, it, was, first, encountered, by, vicente, y, ez, pinz, n, a, spanish, navigator, who, had, accompanied, columbus, in, his, first, voyage, of, discovery, to, the, americas, having, supposedly, arrived, in, today, s, pernambuco, region, on, 26, january, 1500, but, was, unable, to, claim, the, land, because, of, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, in, april, 1500, brazil, was, claimed, for, portugal, on, the, arrival, of, the, portuguese, fleet, commanded, by, pedro, lvares, cabral, the, portuguese, encountered, stone, using, natives, divided, into, several, tribes, many, of, whom, shared, the, same, tupi, guarani, language, family, and, fought, among, themselves, early, names, for, the, country, included, santa, cruz, holy, cross, and, terra, dos, papagaios, land, of, the, parrots, after, european, arrival, the, land, s, major, export, was, a, type, of, tree, the, traders, and, colonists, called, pau, brasil, latin, for, wood, red, like, an, ember, or, brazilwood, from, which, gave, it, its, final, name, a, large, tree, caesalpinia, echinata, whose, trunk, yields, a, prized, red, dye, and, which, was, nearly, wiped, out, as, a, result, of, overexploitation, until, 1529, portugal, had, little, interest, in, settling, brazil, mainly, due, to, being, focused, on, the, high, profits, gained, through, its, commerce, with, india, china, and, the, east, indies, this, lack, of, interest, allowed, traders, pirates, and, privateers, of, several, countries, to, poach, profitable, brazilwood, in, lands, claimed, by, portugal, with, france, setting, up, the, short, lived, colony, of, france, antarctique, in, 1555, in, response, the, portuguese, crown, devised, a, system, to, effectively, settle, brazil, through, the, hereditary, captaincies, system, brazil, was, divided, into, strips, of, land, that, were, donated, to, portuguese, noblemen, who, were, in, turn, responsible, for, the, occupation, and, administration, of, the, land, and, answered, to, the, king, the, system, was, later, substituted, to, a, dual, state, government, in, 1572, where, the, country, was, divided, into, the, northern, government, based, in, salvador, and, the, southern, government, based, in, rio, de, janeiro, the, portuguese, brazilian, settlers, introduced, and, propagated, old, world, cultures, such, as, rice, coffee, sugar, cows, chicken, pigs, bread, wheat, wine, oranges, horses, stonemasonry, metalworking, and, guitars, and, more, the, portuguese, have, favoured, assimilation, and, tolerance, for, other, peoples, and, intermarriage, was, more, acceptable, since, colonial, times, portuguese, settlers, intermarried, with, indigenous, and, african, populations, thus, making, the, brazilian, population, diverse, since, colonial, times, with, the, most, common, mixtures, occurring, between, white, portuguese, settlers, indigenous, and, african, populations, in, present, times, the, largest, ethnic, groups, are, brazilians, of, mainly, european, descent, which, account, for, nearly, one, half, 47, 7, the, population, while, roughly, the, other, half, of, the, population, 43, 1, are, people, of, mixed, ethnic, backgrounds, of, the, total, are, mulattos, mulattos, people, of, mixed, african, and, european, ancestry, the, remaining, racial, composition, of, the, population, consists, of, entirely, african, ancestry, 7, 6, asian, which, accounts, for, nearly, 1, 1, of, the, population, and, indigenous, consisting, of, only, 0, 4, of, the, population, in, 1578, the, young, king, sebastian, king, of, portugal, disappeared, in, a, crusade, in, morocco, during, the, battle, of, alc, cer, quibir, the, king, had, entered, the, war, without, much, allied, support, or, the, necessary, resources, to, fight, properly, with, his, disappearance, and, since, he, had, no, direct, heirs, philip, ii, of, spain, who, was, his, uncle, and, whose, grandfather, was, the, portuguese, king, manuel, i, of, portugal, was, the, only, successor, and, took, the, portuguese, administration, in, hands, in, 1580, in, what, was, called, the, iberian, union, which, lasted, 60, years, later, in, 1640, john, iv, of, portugal, duke, of, braganza, restored, portuguese, independence, and, formed, the, 3rd, portuguese, royal, dynasty, the, house, of, braganza, with, the, merging, of, the, crowns, in, the, iberian, union, portuguese, brazilian, settlers, were, legally, allowed, to, cross, beyond, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, line, and, thus, more, interior, expansions, of, brazil, began, or, were, at, least, officialized, and, cartographed, during, that, period, sebastian, never, returned, which, originated, the, messianic, line, of, thought, sebastianism, which, would, see, the, rightful, king, return, from, the, mists, and, restore, the, kingdom, to, its, former, glory, sebastianism, permeates, the, lusophone, culture, even, today, in, different, ways, around, the, world, but, a, transformation, is, happening, in, portugal, in, regards, to, how, to, approach, and, feel, this, prophecy, metaphor, in, brazil, the, most, important, manifestation, of, sebastianism, took, place, in, the, context, of, the, proclamation, of, the, republic, when, movements, defending, a, return, to, the, monarchy, emerged, it, is, categorised, as, an, example, of, the, king, asleep, in, mountain, folk, motif, typified, by, people, awaiting, a, hero, the, portuguese, author, fernando, pessoa, wrote, about, such, a, hero, in, his, epic, mensagem, the, message, it, is, the, longest, lived, and, most, influential, millenarian, legends, in, western, europe, having, had, profound, political, and, cultural, resonances, from, the, time, of, sebastian, s, death, until, at, least, the, late, 19th, century, in, brazil, the, tamoyo, confederation, confedera, o, dos, tamoios, in, portuguese, language, was, a, military, alliance, of, aboriginal, chieftains, of, the, sea, coast, ranging, from, what, is, today, santos, to, rio, de, janeiro, which, occurred, from, 1554, to, 1567, the, main, reason, for, this, rather, unusual, alliance, between, separate, tribes, was, to, react, against, slavery, and, wholesale, murder, and, destruction, brought, by, the, early, portuguese, discoverers, and, settlers, of, brazil, onto, the, tupinamb, people, in, the, tupi, language, tamuya, means, elder, or, grandfather, cunhambebe, was, elected, chief, of, the, confederation, by, his, counterparts, and, together, with, chiefs, pindobu, koakira, arara, and, aimber, declared, war, on, the, portuguese, starting, in, the, sixteenth, century, sugarcane, grown, on, plantations, called, engenhos, along, the, northeast, coast, brazil, s, nordeste, became, the, base, of, brazilian, economy, and, society, with, the, use, of, slaves, on, large, plantations, to, produce, sugar, for, europe, at, first, settlers, tried, to, enslave, the, natives, as, labor, to, work, the, fields, portugal, had, pioneered, the, plantation, system, in, the, atlantic, islands, of, madeira, and, s, o, tom, with, forced, labor, high, capital, inputs, of, machinery, slaves, and, work, animals, the, extensive, cultivation, of, sugar, was, for, an, export, market, necessitating, land, that, could, be, acquired, with, relatively, little, conflict, from, existing, occupants, by, 1570, brazil, s, sugar, output, rivaled, that, of, the, atlantic, islands, in, the, mid, seventeenth, century, the, dutch, seized, productive, areas, of, northeast, brazil, from, 1630, to, 1654, and, took, over, the, plantations, when, the, dutch, were, expelled, from, brazil, following, a, strong, push, by, portuguese, brazilians, and, their, indigenous, and, afro, brazilian, allies, the, dutch, as, well, as, the, english, and, french, set, up, sugar, production, on, the, plantation, model, of, brazil, in, the, caribbean, increased,

for, african, slaves, brazil, s, settlement, and, economic, development, was, largely, on, its, lengthy, coastline, the, dutch, incursion, had, underlined, the, vulnerability, of, brazil, to, foreigners, and, the, crown, responded, by, building, coastal, forts, and, creating, a, marine, patrol, to, protect, the, colony, the, initial, exploration, of, brazil, s, interior, was, largely, due, to, para, military, adventurers, the, bandeirantes, who, entered, the, jungle, in, search, of, gold, and, native, slaves, however, colonists, were, unable, to, continually, enslave, natives, and, portuguese, sugar, planters, soon, turned, to, import, millions, of, slaves, from, africa, mortality, rates, for, slaves, in, sugar, and, gold, enterprises, were, dramatic, and, there, were, often, not, enough, females, or, proper, conditions, to, replenish, the, slave, population, through, natural, increase, still, africans, became, a, substantial, section, of, brazilian, population, and, long, before, the, end, of, slavery, 1888, they, had, begun, to, merge, with, the, european, brazilian, population, through, miscegenation, during, the, first, 150, years, of, the, colonial, period, attracted, by, the, vast, natural, resources, and, untapped, land, other, european, powers, tried, to, establish, colonies, in, several, parts, of, brazilian, territory, in, defiance, of, the, papal, bull, inter, caetera, and, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, which, had, divided, the, new, world, into, two, parts, between, portugal, and, spain, french, colonists, tried, to, settle, in, present, day, rio, de, janeiro, from, 1555, to, 1567, the, so, called, france, antarctique, episode, and, in, present, day, s, o, lu, s, from, 1612, to, 1614, the, so, called, france, quinoxiale, jesuits, arrived,

temporarily, captured, the, capital, salvador, from, 1630, to, 1654, the, dutch, set, up, more, permanently, in, the, northwest, and, controlled, a, long, stretch, of, the, coast, most, accessible, to, europe, without, however, penetrating, the, interior, but, the, colonists, of, the, dutch, west, india, company, in, brazil, were, in, a, constant, state, of, siege, in, spite, of, the, presence, in, recife, of, john, maurice, of, nassau, as, governor, after, several, years, of, open, warfare, the, dutch, withdrew, by, 1654, little, french, and, dutch, cultural, and, ethnic, influences, remained, of, these, failed, attempts, and, the, portuguese, subsequently, defended, its, coastline, more, vigorously, slave, rebellions, were, frequent, until, the, practice, of, slavery, was, abolished, in, 1888, the, most, famous, of, the, revolts, was, led, by, zumbi, dos, palmares, the, state, he, established, named, the, quilombo, dos, palmares, was, a, self, sustaining, republic, of, maroons, escaped, from, the, portuguese, settlements, in, brazil, and, was, a, region, perhaps, the, size, of, portugal, in, the, hinterland, of, pernambuco, at, its, height, palmares, had, a, population, of, over, 30, 000, forced, to, defend, against, repeated, attacks, by, portuguese, colonial, power, the, warriors, of, palmares, were, expert, in, capoeira, a, martial, arts, form, developed, in, brazil, by, african, slaves, in, the, 16th, century, an, african, known, only, as, zumbi, was, born, free, in, palmares, in, 1655, but, was, captured, by, the, portuguese, and, given, to, a, missionary, father, ant, nio, melo, when, he, was, approximately, 6, years, old, baptized, francisco, zumbi, was, taught, the, sacraments, learned, portuguese, and, latin, and, helped, with, daily, mass, despite, attempts, to, civilize, him, zumbi, escaped, in, 1670, and, at, the, age, of, 15, returned, to, his, birthplace, zumbi, became, known, for, his, physical, prowess, and, cunning, in, battle, and, was, a, respected, military, strategist, by, the, time, he, was, in, his, early, twenties, by, 1678, the, governor, of, the, captaincy, of, pernambuco, pedro, almeida, weary, of, the, longstanding, conflict, with, palmares, approached, its, leader, ganga, zumba, with, an, olive, branch, almeida, offered, freedom, for, all, runaway, slaves, if, palmares, would, submit, to, portuguese, authority, a, proposal, which, ganga, zumba, favored, but, zumbi, was, distrustful, of, the, portuguese, further, he, refused, to, accept, freedom, for, the, people, of, palmares, while, other, africans, remained, enslaved, he, rejected, almeida, s, overture, and, challenged, ganga, zumba, s, leadership, vowing, to, continue, the, resistance, to, portuguese, oppression, zumbi, became, the, new, leader, of, palmares, fifteen, years, after, zumbi, assumed, leadership, of, palmares, portuguese, military, commanders, domingos, jorge, velho, and, vieira, de, melo, mounted, an, artillery, assault, on, the, quilombo, on, february, 6, 1694, after, 67, years, of, ceaseless, conflict, with, the, cafuzos, maroons, of, palmares, the, portuguese, succeeded, in, destroying, cerca, do, macaco, the, republic, s, central, settlement, palmares, warriors, were, no, match, for, the, portuguese, artillery, the, republic, fell, and, zumbi, was, wounded, though, he, survived, and, managed, to, elude, the, portuguese, he, was, betrayed, captured, almost, two, years, later, and, beheaded, on, the, spot, on, november, 20, 1695, the, portuguese, transported, zumbi, s, head, to, recife, where, it, was, displayed, in, the, central, pra, a, as, proof, that, contrary, to, popular, legend, among, african, slaves, zumbi, was, not, immortal, it, was, also, done, as, a, warning, of, what, would, happen, to, others, if, they, tried, to, be, as, brave, as, him, remnants, of, the, old, quilombos, continued, to, reside, in, the, region, for, another, hundred, years, the, discovery, of, gold, in, the, early, eighteenth, century, was, met, with, great, enthusiasm, by, portugal, which, had, an, economy, in, disarray, following, years, of, wars, against, spain, and, the, netherlands, a, gold, rush, quickly, ensued, with, people, from, other, parts, of, the, colony, and, portugal, flooding, the, region, in, the, first, half, of, the, eighteenth, century, the, large, portion, of, the, brazilian, inland, where, gold, was, extracted, became, known, as, the, minas, gerais, general, mines, gold, mining, in, this, area, became, the, main, economic, activity, of, colonial, brazil, during, the, eighteenth, century, in, portugal, the, gold, was, mainly, used, to, pay, for, industrialized, goods, textiles, weapons, obtained, from, countries, such, as, england, and, especially, during, the, reign, of, king, john, v, to, build, baroque, monuments, such, as, the, convent, of, mafra, in, brasil, it, resulted, in, the, emergence, of, towns, and, cities, that, are, today, unesco, world, heritage, sites, such, as, ouro, preto, one, of, the, biggest, most, populous, towns, in, the, americas, during, that, period, and, many, other, historical, towns, with,

european, immigrants, and, the, government, decided, to, bring, in, bureaucrats, from, portugal, to, control, operations, they, set, up, numerous, bureaucracies, often, with, conflicting, duties, and, jurisdictions, the, officials, generally, proved, unequal, to, the, task, of, controlling, this, highly, lucrative, industry, following, brazilian, independence, the, british, pursued, extensive, economic, activity, in, brazil, in, 1830, the, saint, john, d, el, rey, mining, company, controlled, by, the, british, opened, the, largest, gold, mine, in, latin, america, the, british, brought, in, modern, management, techniques, and, engineering, expertise, located, in, nova, lima, the, mine, produced, ore, for, 125, years, diamond, deposits, were, found, near, vila, do, pr, ncipe, around, the, village, of, tijuco, in, the, 1720s, and, a, rush, to, extract, the, precious, stones, ensued, flooding, the, european, market, the, portuguese, crown, intervened, to, control, production, in, diamantina, the, diamond, district, a, system, of, bids, for, the, right, to, extract, diamonds, was, established, but, in, 1771, it, was, abolished, and, the, crown, retained, the, monopoly, mining, stimulated, regional, growth, in, southern, brazil, not, just, from, extraction, of, gold, and, diamonds, but, the, stimulation, of, food, production, for, local, consumption, more, importantly, it, stimulated, commerce, and, the, development, of, merchant, communities, in, port, cities, nominally, the, portuguese, controlled, the, trade, to, brazil, banning, the, establishment, productive,

direct, trade, with, foreign, nations, was, forbidden, but, prior, to, the, dutch, incursion, much, of, brazil, s, exports, were, carried, in, dutch, ships, after, the, american, revolution, u, s, ships, called, at, brazilian, ports, when, the, portuguese, monarchy, fled, iberia, to, brazil, in, 1808, during, the, napoleonic, wars, one, of, the, first, acts, of, the, monarch, was, to, open,

almost, 90, years, as, the, haitian, revolution, for, independence, against, the, french, crown, was, taking, place, in, the, late, 1700s, brazil, then, a, colony, of, portugal, was, also, on, the, verge, of, starting, their, own, revolution, for, independence, in, the, early, 1790s, plots, to, overthrow, the, portuguese, colonial, government, flooded, the, streets, of, brazil, poor, whites, a, few, upper, class, whites, freed, persons, slaves, and, mixed, race, natives, wanted, to, revolt, against, the, portuguese, crown, in, order, to, abolish, slavery, take, power, from, the, catholic, church, end, all, forms, of, racial, oppression, and, establish, a, new, governmental, system, that, provided, equal, opportunities, to, all, citizens, though, original, plots, had, been, foiled, by, royal, authorities, brazilians, remained, persistent, in, forming, plots, for, revolutions, after, an, outbreak, of, successful, independence, movements, the, plan, was, similar, to, that, of, the, french, revolutions, which, by, this, time, period, had, established, the, revolutionary, rhetoric, for, much, of, the, colonial, world, however, the, harsh, punishment, inflicted, upon, poor, whites, working, people, of, color, and, slaves, had, silenced, many, voices, of, the, revolution, as, for, the, white, elites, while, some, remained, influenced, by, the, revolutionary, ideals, spreading, through, france, others, saw, the, incredible, and, intimidating, strength, of, the, lower, classes, through, the, haitian, revolution, and, feared, that, an, uprising, from, their, own, lower, class, may, lead, to, something, equally, as, catastrophic, to, their, society, it, would, not, be, until, september, 7, 1822, that, the, portuguese, prince, dom, pedro, would, declare, brazil, as, its, own, independent, empire, in, 1808, the, portuguese, court, fleeing, from, napoleon, s, invasion, of, portugal, during, the, peninsular, war, in, a, large, fleet, escorted, by, british, men, of, war,

15, years, and, there, he, would, have, remained, for, the, rest, of, his, life, if, it, were, not, for, the, turmoil, aroused, in, portugal, due, among, other, reasons, to, his, long, stay, in,

the, portuguese, empire, for, 14, years, d, pedro, of, bragan, a, i, of, brazil, iv, of, portugal, abdicated, the, brazilian, imperial, throne, in, 1831, for, political, incompatibilities, displeased, both, by, the, landed, elites, who, thought, him, too, liberal, and, by, the, intellectuals, who, felt, he, was, not, liberal, enough, and, left, for, portugal, to, defend, his, daughter, s, d, maria, ii, of, portugal, claim, to, the, portuguese, throne, and, establish, a, constitutional, monarchy, in, portugal, leaving, his, five, year, old, son, d, pedro, ii, of, brazil, whose, mother, was,

earnings, the, growers, and, exporters, played, major, roles, in, politics, however, historians, debate, whether, or, not, they, were, the, most, powerful, actors, in, the, political, system, before, the, 1960s, historians, generally, ignored, the, coffee, industry, coffee, was, not, a, major, industry, in, the, colonial, period, in, any, one, particular, locality, the, coffee, industry, flourished, for, a, few, decades, and, then, moved, on, as, the, soil, lost, its, fertility, therefore, it, was, not, deeply, embedded, in, the, history, of, any, one, locality, after, independence, coffee, plantations, were, associated, with, slavery, underdevelopment, and, a, political, oligarchy, and, not, the, modern, development, of, state, and, society, historians, now, recognize, the, importance, of, the, industry, and, there, is, a, flourishing, scholarly, literature, the, rubber, boom, in, the, amazon, in, the, 1880s, 1910s, radically, reshaped, the, amazonian, economy, for,
