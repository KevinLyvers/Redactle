and, 130, bce, expanding, the, kingdom, in, afghanistan, and, pakistan, to, even, larger, proportions, than, demetrius, after, menander, s, death, the, indo, greeks, steadily, declined, and, the, last, indo, greek, kings, strato, ii, and, strato, iii, were, defeated, in, c, 10, ce, the, indo, greek, kingdom, was, succeeded, by, the, indo, scythians, the, indo, scythians, were, descended, from,

the, present, punjab, province, of, pakistan, as, their, residence, but, during, their, last, few, years, of, existence, the, capital, shifted, between, kabul, and, peshawar, these, kings, have, traditionally, been, referred, to, as, indo, parthians, as, their, coinage, was, often, inspired, by, the, arsacid, dynasty, but, they, probably, belonged, to, a, wider, groups, of, iranic, tribes, who, lived, east, of, parthia, proper, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, all, the, kings, who, assumed, the, title, gondophares, which, means, holder, of, glory, were, even, related, christian,

fight, to, the, death, whether, we, like, to, talk, to, them, or, we, don, t, like, to, talk, to, them, they, will, continue, to, fight, so, for, them, i, don, t, think, that, we, have, a, way, forward, with, talks, or, negotiations, or, contacts, or, anything, as, such, then, we, have, to, be, prepared, to, tackle, and, deal, with, them, militarily, in, terms, of, the, taliban, on, the,
