the, five, dynasties, and, ten, kingdoms, period, chinese, was, an, era, of, political, upheaval, and, division, in, imperial, china, from, 907, to, 979, five, dynastic, states, quickly, succeeded, one, another, in, the, central, plain, and, more, than, a, dozen, concurrent, dynastic, states, collectively, known, as, the, ten, kingdoms, were, established, elsewhere, mainly, in, south, china, it, was, a, prolonged, period, of, multiple, political, divisions, in, chinese, imperial, history, traditionally, the, era, is, seen, as, beginning, with, the, fall, of, the, tang, dynasty, in, 907, and, reaching, its, climax, with, the, founding, of, the, song, dynasty, in, 960, in, the, following, 19, years, song, gradually, subdued, the, remaining, states, in, south, china, but, the, liao, dynasty, still, remained, in, china, s, north, eventually, succeeded, by, the, jin, dynasty, and, the, western, xia, was, eventually, established, in, china, s, northwest, many, states, had, been, de, facto, independent, long, before, 907, as, the, late, tang, dynasty, s, control, over, its, numerous, fanzhen, officials, waned, but, the, key, event, was, their, recognition, as, sovereign, by, foreign, powers, after, the, tang, collapsed, several, warlords, of, the, central, plain, crowned, themselves, emperor, during, the, 70, year, period, there, was, near, constant, warfare, between, the, emerging, kingdoms, and, the, alliances, they, formed, all, had, the, ultimate, goal, of, controlling, the, central, plain, and, establishing, themselves, as, the, tang, s, successor, the, last, of, the, five, dynasties, and, ten, kingdoms, regimes, was, northern, han, which, held, out, until, song, conquered, it, in, 979, for, the, next, several, centuries, although, the, song, controlled, much, of, south, china, they, coexisted, alongside, the, liao, dynasty, jin, dynasty, and, various, other, regimes, in, china, s, north, until, finally, all, of, them, were, unified, under, the, yuan, dynasty, towards, the, end, of, the, tang, dynasty, the, imperial, government, granted, increased, powers, to, the, jiedushi, the, regional, military, governors, the, an, lushan, 755, 763, and, huang, chao, rebellions, weakened, the, imperial, government, and, by, the, early, 10th, century, the, jiedushi, commanded, de, facto, independence, from, its, authority, in, the, last, decades, of, the, tang, dynasty, they, were, not, even, appointed, by, the, central, court, anymore, but, developed, hereditary, systems, from, father, to, son, or, from, patron, to, prot, g, they, had, their, own, armies, rivaling, the, palace, armies, and, amassed, huge, wealth, as, testified, by, their, sumptuous, tombs, due, to, the, decline, of, tang, central, authority, after, the, an, lushan, rebellion, there, was, a, growing, tendency, to, superimpose, large, regional, administrations, over, the, old, districts, and, prefectures, that, had, been, used, since, the, qin, dynasty, 221, 206, bc, these, administrations, known, as, circuit, commissions, would, become, the, boundaries, of, the, later, southern, regimes, many, circuit, commissioners, became, the, emperors, or, kings, of, these, states, the, historian, hugh, clark, proposed, a, three, stage, model, of, broad, political, trends, during, this, time, period, the, first, stage, 880, 910, consists, of, the, period, between, the, huang, chao, rebellion, and, the, formal, end, of, the, tang, dynasty, which, saw, chaotic, fighting, between, warlords, who, controlled, approximately, one, or, two, prefectures, each, the, second, stage, 910, 950, saw, the, various, warlords, stabilize, and, gain, enough, legitimacy, to, proclaim, new, dynasties, the, third, stage, 950, 979, saw, the, forceful, reunification, of, china, by, the, later, zhou, dynasty, and, its, successor, the, song, dynasty, and, the, demilitarisation, of, the, provinces, southern, china, divided, into, several, independent, dynastic, kingdoms, was, more, stable, than, the, north, which, saw, constant, regime, change, consequently, the, southern, kingdoms, were, able, to, embark, on, trade, land, reclamation, and, infrastructure, projects, laying, the, groundwork, for, the, song, dynasty, economic, boom, this, economic, shift, to, the, south, also, led, to, a, vast, southward, migration, according, to, nicholas, tackett, the, three, provinces, of, hebei, chengde, youzhou, weibo, were, able, to, maintain, much, greater, autonomy, from, the, central, government, in, the, aftermath, of, the, an, lushan, rebellion, with, their, administration, under, local, military, control, these, provinces, never, submitted, tax, revenues, and, governorships, lapsed, into, hereditary, succession, they, engaged, in, occasional, war, with, the, central, government, or, against, each, other, and, youzhou, seemed, to, conduct, its, own, foreign, policy, this, meant, that, the, culture, of, these, northeastern, provinces, started, diverging, from, the, capital, many, of, the, elites, in, post, tang, china, including, the, future, emperors, of, the, song, dynasty, came, from, this, region, the, administrations, of, the, five, dynasties, and, the, early, song, dynasty, shared, a, pattern, of, being, disproportionately, drawn, from, the, families, of, military, governors, in, northern, and, northwestern, china, hebei, shanxi, shaanxi, their, personal, staff, and, the, bureaucrats, who, served, in, the, capitals, of, the, five, dynasties, these, families, had, risen, to, prominence, due, to, the, unraveling, of, central, authority, after, the, an, lushan, rebellion, despite, lacking, esteemed, ancestry, the, historian, deng, xiaonan, argued, that, many, of, these, military, families, including, the, song, imperial, family, were, of, mixed, han, chinese, turkic, kumo, xi, ancestry, the, term, five, dynasties, was, coined, by, song, dynasty, historians, and, reflects, the, view, that, the, successive, regimes, based, in, kaifeng, controlled, the, central, plain, and, possessed, the, mandate, of, heaven, the, first, of, the, five, dynasties, was, founded, by, zhu, wen, the, rebel, defector, turned, warlord, who, ultimately, ended, the, tang, dynasty, the, rest, of, the, five, dynasties, as, well, as, the, song, dynasty, all, emerged, from, a, military, organization, originally, led, by, shatuo, turks, whose, commanders, replaced, each, other, in, frequent, coup, d, tat, the, later, tang, was, founded, by, li, cunxu, the, son, of, shatuo, leader, li, keyong, who, was, the, main, military, rival, to, zhu, wen, in, the, late, tang, the, later, jin, founder, shi, jingtang, was, the, son, of, a, shatuo, commander, in, li, keyong, s, army, and, became, the, son, in, law, of, the, later, tang, general, and, emperor, li, siyuan, who, was, himself, an, adopted, son, of, li, keyong, the, later, han, founder, liu, zhiyuan, was, a, shatuo, officer, under, li, siyuan, and, shi, jintang, the, father, of, the, later, zhou, founder, guo, wei, fought, in, li, keyong, s, army, and, guo, served, under, liu, zhiyuan, the, father, of, song, founder, zhao, kuangyin, served, in, the, armies, of, later, tang, later, han, and, later, zhou, zhao, also, a, professional, soldier, rose, through, the, ranks, of, the, later, zhou, before, seizing, the, throne, in, the, chenqiao, mutiny, in, 960, which, ended, the, era, of, the, five, dynasties, the, qing, historian, wang, fuzhi, 1619, 1692, wrote, that, this, period, could, be, compared, to, the, earlier, warring, states, period, of, ancient, china, remarking, that, none, of, the, rulers, could, be, described, as, son, of, heaven, the, five, dynasties, rulers, despite, claiming, the, status, of, emperor, sometimes, dealt, with, each, other, on, terms, of, diplomatic, equality, out, of, pragmatic, concern, this, concept, of, sharing, the, mandate, of, heaven, as, sibling, states, was, the, result, of, the, brief, balance, of, power, after, the, reunification, of, china, by, the, song, dynasty, the, song, embarked, on, a, special, effort, to, denounce, such, arrangements, the, southern, regimes, generally, had, more, stable, and, effective, government, during, this, period, even, the, rulers, of, the, southern, states, were, almost, all, military, leaders, from, the, north, with, their, key, officers, and, elite, forces, also, hailing, from, the, north,

up, through, superior, military, ability, who, were, later, scorned, as, bandits, by, future, scholars, however, once, established, these, rulers, took, great, pains, to, portray, themselves, as, promoters, of, culture, and, economic, development, so, as, to, legitimize, their, rule, many, wooed, former, tang, courtiers, to, help, administer, their, states, the, economies, of, each, of, the, southern, regions, had, prospered, in, the, late, tang, guangdong, and, fujian, were, the, sites, of, important, port, cities, trading, exotic, goods, the, middle, yangtze, and, sichuan, were,

economically, interdependent, sui, and, tang, s, policies, while, paying, little, attention, to, developing, the, south, gave, the, south, room, to, innovate, free, of, tight, administrative, controls, the, dominant, northern, officials, had, been, unwilling, to, serve, in, the, south, during, the, tang, and, so, southerners, were, recruited, by, the, tang, to, serve, in, a, local, capacity, under, the, southern, selection, supplemental, system, these, southern, officials, became, the, administrative, core, of, the, ten, kingdoms, and, later, dominated, the, bureaucracy, by, the, mid, song, north, china, south, china, during, the, tang, dynasty, the, warlord, zhu, wen, was, originally, a, member, of, huang, chao, s, rebel, army, he, took, on, a, crucial, role, in,
