the, vedic, period, or, the, vedic, age, c, 1500, c, 500, bce, is, the, period, in, the, late, bronze, age, and, early, iron, age, of, the, history, of, india, when, the, vedic, literature, including, the, vedas, c, 1500, 900, bce, was, composed, in, the, northern, indian, subcontinent, between, the, end, of, the, urban, indus, valley, civilisation, and, a, second, urbanisation, which, began, in, the, central, indo, gangetic, plain, c, 600, bce, the, vedas, are, liturgical, texts, which, formed, the, basis, of, the, influential, brahmanical, ideology, which, developed, in, the, kuru, kingdom, a, tribal, union, of, several, indo, aryan, tribes, the, vedas, contain, details, of, life, during, this, period, that, have, been, interpreted, to, be, historical, and, constitute, the, primary, sources, for, understanding, the, period, these, documents, alongside, the, corresponding, archaeological, record, allow, for, the, evolution, of, the, indo, aryan, and, vedic, culture, to, be, traced, and, inferred, the, vedas, were, composed, and, orally, transmitted, with, precision, by, speakers, of, an, old, indo, aryan, language, who, had, migrated, into, the, northwestern, regions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, early, in, this, period, the, vedic, society, was, patriarchal, and, patrilineal, early, indo, aryans, were, a, late, bronze, age, society, centred, in, the, punjab, organised, into, tribes, rather, than, kingdoms, and, primarily, sustained, by, a, pastoral, way, of, life, around, c, 1200, 1000, bce, the, aryan, culture, spread, eastward, to, the, fertile, western, ganges, plain, iron, tools, were, adopted, which, allowed, for, the, clearing, of, forests, and, the, adoption, of, a, more, settled, agricultural, way, of, life, the, second, half, of, the, vedic, period, was, characterised, by, the, emergence, of, towns, kingdoms, and, a, complex, social, differentiation, distinctive, to, india, and, the, kuru, kingdom, s, codification, of, orthodox, sacrificial, ritual, during, this, time, the, central, ganges, plain, was, dominated, by, a, related, but, non, vedic, indo, aryan, culture, of, greater, magadha, the, end, of, the, vedic, period, witnessed, the, rise, of, true, cities, and, large, states, called, mahajanapadas, as, well, as, rama, a, movements, including, jainism, and, buddhism, which, challenged, the, vedic, orthodoxy, the, vedic, period, saw, the, emergence, of, a, hierarchy, of, social, classes, that, would, remain, influential, vedic, religion, developed, into, brahmanical, orthodoxy, and, around, the, beginning, of, the, common, era, the, vedic, tradition, formed, one, of, the, main, constituents, of, hindu, synthesis, archaeological, cultures, identified, with, phases, of, indo, aryan, material, culture, include, the, ochre, coloured, pottery, culture, the, gandhara, grave, culture, the, black, and, red, ware, culture, and, the, painted, grey, ware, culture, pgw, the, early, vedic, age, is, historically, dated, to, the, second, half, of, the, second, millennium, bce, historically, after, the, collapse, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, which, occurred, around, 1900, bce, groups, of, indo, aryan, peoples, migrated, into, north, western, india, and, started, to, inhabit, the, northern, indus, valley, the, indo, aryans, represented, a, sub, group, that, diverged, from, other, indo, iranian, tribes, at, the, andronovo, horizon, before, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, the, indo, iranians, originated, in, the, sintashta, culture, from, which, arose, the, subsequent, andronovo, horizon, the, indo, aryans, migrated, through, the, adjacent, bactria, margiana, area, present, day, northern, afghanistan, to, northwest, india, followed, by, the, rise, of, the, iranian, yaz, culture, at, c, 1500, bce, and, the, iranian, migrations, into, iran, at, c, 800, bce, some, indian, writers, and, archaeologists, have, opposed, the, notion, of, a, migration, of, indo, aryans, into, india, and, argued, for, an, indigenous, origin, of, the, indo, aryans, in, this, view, the, indian, civilization, must, be, viewed, as, an, unbroken, tradition, that, goes, back, to, the, earliest, period, of, the, sindhu, sarasvati, or, indus, tradition, 7000, or, 8000, bce, though, popular, in, india, and, reflecting, indian, views, on, indian, history, and, religion, the, idea, of, a, purely, indigenous, origin, of, the, indo, aryans, is, outside, the, academic, mainstream, the, knowledge, about, the, aryans, comes, mostly, from, the, rigveda, samhita, i, e, the, oldest, layer, of, the, vedas, which, was, composed, c, 1400, 1000, bce, they, brought, with, them, their, distinctive, religious, traditions, and, practices, the, vedic, beliefs, and, practices, of, the, pre, classical, era, were, closely, related, to, the, hypothesised, proto, indo, european, religion, and, the, indo, iranian, religion, funeral, sacrifices, from, the, sintashta, culture, show, close, parallels, to, the, sacrificial, funeral, rites, of, the, rigveda, while, according, to, anthony, the, old, indic, religion, probably, emerged, among, indo, european, immigrants, in, the, contact, zone, between, the, zeravshan, river, present, day, uzbekistan, and, present, day, tajikistan, it, was, a, syncretic, mixture, of, old, central, asian, and, new, indo, european, elements, which, borrowed, distinctive, religious, beliefs, and, practices, from, the, bactria, margiana, culture, including, the, god, indra, and, the, ritual, drink, soma, the, rigveda, contains, accounts, of, conflicts, between, the, aryas, and, the, dasas, and, dasyus, it, describes, dasas, and, dasyus, as, people, who, do, not, perform, sacrifices, akratu, or, obey, the, commandments, of, gods, avrata, their, speech, is, described, as, mridhra, which, could, variously, mean, soft, uncouth, hostile, scornful, or, abusive, other, adjectives, which, describe, their, physical, appearance, are, subject, to, many, interpretations, however, some, modern, scholars, such, as, asko, parpola, connect, the, dasas, and, dasyus, to, iranian, tribes, dahae, and, dahyu, and, believe, that, dasas, and, dasyus, were, early, indo, aryan, immigrants, who, arrived, into, the, subcontinent, before, the, vedic, aryans, likewise, bronkhorst, has, argued, that, the, central, ganges, plain, was, dominated, by, a, related, but, non, vedic, indo, aryan, culture, a, difference, also, noted, by, samuel, accounts, of, military, conflicts, in, between, the, various, tribes, of, vedic, aryans, are, also, described, in, the, rigveda, most, notable, of, such, conflicts, was, the, battle, of, the, ten, kings, which, took, place, on, the, banks, of, the, river, parushni, modern, day, ravi, the, battle, was, fought, between, the, tribe, bharatas, led, by, their, chief, sudas, against, a, confederation, of, ten, tribes, the, bharatas, lived, around, the, upper, regions, of, the, river, saraswati, while, the, purus, their, western, neighbours, lived, along, the, lower, regions, of, saraswati, the, other, tribes, dwelt, north, west, of, the, bharatas, in, the, region, of, punjab, division, of, the, waters, of, ravi, could, have, been, a, reason, for, the, war, the, confederation, of, tribes, tried, to, inundate, the, bharatas, by, opening, the, embankments, of, ravi, yet, sudas, emerged, victorious, in, the, battle, of, ten, kings, the, bharatas, and, the, purus, merged, into, a, new, tribe, the, kuru, after, the, war, after, the, 12th, century, bce, as, the, rigveda, had, taken, its, final, form, the, vedic, society, which, is, associated, with, the, kuru, panchala, region, but, were, not, the, only, indo, aryan, people, in, northern, india, transitioned, from, semi, nomadic, life, to, settled, agriculture, in, north, western, india, possession, of, horses, remained, an, important, priority, of, vedic, leaders, and, a, remnant, of, the, nomadic, lifestyle, resulting, in, trade, routes, beyond, the, hindu, kush, to, maintain, this, supply, as, horses, needed, for, cavalry, and, sacrifice, could, not, be, bred, in, india, the, gangetic, plains, had, remained, out, of, bounds, to, the, vedic, tribes, because, of, thick, forest, cover, after, 1000, bce, the, use, of, iron, axes, and, ploughs, became, widespread, and, the, jungles, could, be, cleared, with, ease, this, enabled, the, vedic, aryans, to, extend, their, settlements, into, the, western, area, of, the, ganga, yamuna, doab, many, of, the, old, tribes, coalesced, to, form, larger, political, units, the, vedic, religion, was, further, developed, with, the, emergence, of, the, kuru, kingdom, systematising, its, religious, literature, and, developing, the, rauta, ritual, it, is, associated, with, the, painted, grey, ware, culture, c, 1200, 600, bce, which, did, not, expand, east, of, the, ganga, yamuya, doab, it, differed, from, the, related, yet, markedly, different, culture, of, the, central, ganges, region, which, was, associated, with, the, northern, black, polished, ware, and, the, mahajanapadas, of, kosala, and, magadha, in, this, period, the, varna, system, emerged, state, kulke, and, rothermund, which, in, this, stage, of, indian, history, were, a, hierarchical, order, of, estates, which, reflected, a, division, of, labor, among, various, social, classes, the, vedic, period, estates, were, four, brahmin, priests, and, warrior, nobility, stood, on, top, free, peasants, and, traders, were, the, third, and, slaves, labourers, and, artisans, many, belonging, to, the, indigenous, people, were, the, fourth, this, was, a, period, where, agriculture, metal, and, commodity, production, as, well, as, trade, greatly, expanded, and, the, vedic, era, texts, including, the, early, upanishads, and, many, sutras, important, to, later, hindu, culture, were, completed, the, kuru, kingdom, the, earliest, vedic, state, was, formed, by, a, super, tribe, which, joined, several, tribes, in, a, new, unit, to, govern, this, state, vedic, hymns, were, collected, and, transcribed, and, new, rituals, were, developed, which, formed, the, now, orthodox, rauta, rituals, two, key, figures, in, this, process, of, the, development, of, the, kuru, state, were, the, king, parikshit, and, his, successor, janamejaya, transforming, this, realm, into, the, dominant, political, and, cultural, power, of, northern, iron, age, india, the, most, well, known, of, the, new, religious, sacrifices, that, arose, in, this, period, were, the, ashvamedha, horse, sacrifice, this, sacrifice, involved, setting, a, consecrated, horse, free, to, roam, the, kingdoms, for, a, year, the, horse, was, followed, by, a, chosen, band, of, warriors, the, kingdoms, and, chiefdoms, in, which, the, horse, wandered, had, to, pay, homage, or, prepare, to, battle, the, king, to, whom, the, horse, belonged, this, sacrifice, put, considerable, pressure, on, inter, state, relations, in, this, era, this, period, saw, also, the, beginning, of, the, social, stratification, by, the, use, of, varna, the, division, of, vedic, society, in, brahmins, kshatriya, vaishya, and, shudra, the, kuru, kingdom, declined, after, its, defeat, by, the, non, vedic, salva, tribe, and, the, political, center, of, vedic, culture, shifted, east, into, the, panchala, kingdom, on, the, ganges, under, king, ke, in, d, lbhya, approximately, between, 900, and, 750, bce, later, in, the, 8th, or, 7th, century, bce, the, kingdom, of, videha, emerged, as, a, political, center, farther, to, the, east, in, what, is, today, northern, bihar, of, india, and, southeastern, nepal, reaching, its, prominence, under, the, king, janaka, whose, court, provided, patronage, for, brahmin, sages, and, philosophers, such, as, yajnavalkya, uddalaka, aruni, and, gargi, vachaknavi, panchala, also, remained, prominent, during, this, period, under, its, king, pravahana, jaivali, by, the, 6th, century, bce, the, political, units, consolidated, into, large, kingdoms, called, mahajanapadas, the, process, of, urbanisation, had, begun, in, these, kingdoms, commerce, and, travel, flourished, even, regions, separated, by, large, distances, became, easy, to, access, anga, a, small, kingdom, to, the, east, of, magadha, on, the, door, step, of, modern, day, west, bengal, formed, the, eastern, boundary, of, the, vedic, culture, yadavas, expanded, towards, the, south, and, settled, in, mathura, to, the, south, of, their, kingdom, was, vatsa, which, was, governed, from, its, capital, kausambi, the, narmada, river, and, parts, of, north, western, deccan, formed, the, southern, limits, the, newly, formed, states, struggled, for, supremacy, and, started, displaying, imperial, ambitions, the, end, of, the, vedic, period, is, marked, by, linguistic, cultural, and, political, changes, the, grammar, of, p, ini, marks, a, final, apex, in, the, codification, of, sutra, texts, and, at, the, same, time, the, beginning, of, classical, sanskrit, meanwhile, in, the, kosala, magadha, region, the, shramana, movements, including, jainism, and, buddhism, objected, the, self, imposed, authority, and, orthodoxy, of, the, intruding, brahmins, and, their, vedic, scriptures, and, ritual, according, to, bronkhorst, the, sramana, culture, arose, in, greater, magadha, which, was, indo, european, but, not, vedic, in, this, culture, kshatriyas, were, placed, higher, than, brahmins, and, it, rejected, vedic, authority, and, rituals, greater, magadha, reached, its, zenith, under, the, maurya, empire, meanwhile, the, achaemenid, invasion, of, cyrus, and, darius, i, of, the, indus, valley, in, the, early, 6th, century, bce, marks, the, beginning, of, outside, influence, which, continued, in, the, kingdoms, of, the, indo, greeks, indo, scythians, and, indo, parthians, this, period, culminated, with, the, kushan, and, gupta, empire, which, resulted, in, the, hindu, synthesis, while, vedic, society, was, relatively, egalitarian, in, the, sense, that, a, distinct, hierarchy, of, socio, economic, classes, or, castes, was, absent, the, vedic, period, saw, the, emergence, of, a, hierarchy, of, social, classes, political, hierarchy, was, determined, by, rank, where, r, jan, tribal, king, or, chieftain, and, r, janya, tribal, nobility, stood, at, the, top, the, vi, the, common, people, in, the, middle, and, the, d, sa, and, dasyu, non, indo, aryan, servants, at, the, bottom, the, words, brahamana, and, kshatriya, occur, in, various, family, books, of, the, rigveda, but, they, are, not, associated, with, the, term, varna, the, words, vaishya, and, shudra, are, absent, verses, of, the, rigveda, such, as, 3, 44, 45, indicate, the, absence, of, strict, social, hierarchy, and, the, existence, of, social, mobility, o, indra, fond, of, soma, would, you, make, me, the, protector, of, people, or, would, you, make, me, a, king, would, you, make, me, a, sage, who, has, drunk, soma,

and, drums, were, the, musical, instruments, played, and, a, heptatonic, scale, was, used, dancing, dramas, chariot, racing, and, gambling, were, other, popular, pastimes, the, emergence, of, monarchical, states, in, the, later, vedic, age, led, to, a, distancing, of, the, rajan, from, the, people, and, the, emergence, of, a, varna, hierarchy, the, society, was, divided, into, four, social, groups, brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas, and, shudras, the, later, vedic, texts, fixed, social, boundaries, roles, status, and, ritual, purity, for, each, of, the, groups, the, shatapatha,

the, top, three, varnas, is, ambiguous, in, the, later, vedic, texts, panchavamsha, brahmana, and, verse, 13, 8, 3, 11, of, the, shatapatha, brahmana, place, kshatriya, over, brahmana, and, vaishya, whereas, verse, 1, 1, 4, 12, places, brahmana, and, vaishya, over, the, kshatriya, and, shudra, the, purusha, sukta, visualised, the, four, varnas, as, hierarchical, but, inter, related, parts, of, an, organic, whole, despite, the, increasing, social, stratification, in, the, later, vedic, times, hymns, like, rigveda, ix, 112, suggest, some, amount, of, social, mobility, i, am, a, reciter, of, hymns, my, father, a, physician, and, my, mother, grinds, corn, with, stones, we, desire, to, obtain, wealth, in, various, actions, household, became, an, important, unit, in, the, later, vedic, age, the, variety, of, households, of, the, vedic, era, gave, way, to, an, idealised, household, which, was, headed, by, a, grihapati, the, relations, between, husband, and, wife, father, and, son, were, hierarchically, organised, and, the, women, were, relegated, to, subordinate, and, docile, roles, polygyny, was, more, common, than, polyandry, and, texts, like, tattiriya, samhita, indicate, taboos, around, menstruating, women, various, professions, women, took, to, are, mentioned, in, the, later, vedic, texts, women, tended, to, cattle, milked, cows, carded, wool, were, weavers, dyers, and, corn, grinders, women, warriors, such, as, vishpala, who, lost, a, leg, in, battle, are, mentioned, two, female, philosophers, are, mentioned, in, the, upanishads, patrick, olivelle, in, his, translation, of, the, upanishads, writes, that, the, fact, that, these, women, are, introduced, without, any, attempt, to, justify, or, to, explain, how, women, could, be, engaged, in, theological, matters, suggests, the, relatively, high, social, and, religious, position, of, at, least, women, of, some, social, strata, during, this, period, early, vedic, aryans, were, organised, into, tribes, rather, than, kingdoms, the, chief, of, a, tribe, was, called, a, rajan, the, autonomy, of, the, rajan, was, restricted, by, the, tribal, councils, called, sabha, and, samiti, the, two, bodies, were, in, part, responsible, for, the, governance, of, the, tribe, the, rajan, could, not, accede, to, the, throne, without, their, approval, the, distinction, between, the, two, bodies, is, not, clear, arthur, llewellyn, basham, a, noted, historian, and, indologist, theorises, that, sabha, was, a, meeting, of, great, men, in, the, tribe, whereas, samiti, was, a, meeting, of, all, free, tribesmen, some, tribes, had, no, hereditary, chiefs, and, were, directly, governed, by, the, tribal, councils, rajan, had, a, rudimentary, court, which, was, attended, by, courtiers, sabhasad, and, chiefs, of, sects, gramani, the, main, responsibility, of, the, rajan, was, to, protect, the, tribe, he, was, aided, by, several, functionaries, including, the, purohita, chaplain, the, senani, army, chief, dutas, envoys, and, spash, spies, purohita, performed, ceremonies, and, spells, for, success, in, war, and, prosperity, in, peace, in, the, later, vedic, period, the, tribes, had, consolidated, into, small, kingdoms, which, had, a, capital, and, a, rudimentary, administrative, system, to, aid, in, governing, these, new, states, the, kings, and, their, brahmin, priests, arranged, vedic, hymns, into, collections, and, developed, a, new, set, of, rituals, the, now, orthodox, rauta, rituals, to, strengthen, the, emerging, social, hierarchy, the, rajan, was, seen, as, the, custodian, of, social, order, and, the, protector, of, rashtra, polity, hereditary, kingship, started, emerging, and, competitions, like, chariot, races, cattle, raids, and, games, of, dice, which, previously, decided, who, was, worthy, of, becoming, a, king, became, nominal, rituals, in, this, era, exalted, the, status, of, the, king, over, his, people, he, was, occasionally, referred, to, as, samrat, supreme, ruler, the, rajan, s, increasing, political, power, enabled, him, to, gain, greater, control, over, the, productive, resources, the, voluntary, gift, offering, bali, became, compulsory, tribute, however, there, was, no, organised, system, of, taxation, sabha, and, samiti, are, still, mentioned, in, later, vedic, texts, though, with, the, increasing, power, of, the, king, their, influence, declined, by, the, end, of, the, later, vedic, age, different, kinds, of, political, systems, such, as, monarchical, states, rajya, oligarchical, states, gana, or, sangha, and, tribal, principalities, had, emerged, in, india, according, to, michael, witzel, s, analysis, of, the, kuru, kingdom, it, can, be, characterized, as, the, earliest, vedic, state, during, the, middle, vedic, period, however, robert, bellah, observes, that, it, is, difficult, to, pin, down, whether, the, kurus, were, a, true, state, or, a, complex, chiefdom, as, the, kuru, kings, notably, never, adopted, royal, titles, higher, than, r, jan, which, means, chief, rather, than, king, in, the, vedic, context, the, middle, vedic, period, is, also, characterized, by, a, lack, of, cities, bellah, compares, this, to, early, state, formation, in, ancient, hawaii, and, very, early, egypt, which, were, territorial, states, rather, than, city, states, and, thus, it, was, the, court, not, the, city, that, provided, the, center, and, the, court, was, often, peripatetic, romila, thapar, characterizes, vedic, era, state, formation, as, being, in, a, condition, of, arrested, development, because, local, chiefs, were, relatively, autonomous, and, because, surplus, wealth, that, could, have, been, directed, towards, state, building, was, instead, used, for, the, increasingly, grandiose, rituals, that, also, served, to, structure, social, relations, the, period, of, the, upanishads, the, final, phase, of, the, vedic, era, was, approximately, contemporaneous, with, a, new, wave, of, state, formations, linked, to, the, beginning, of, urbanization, in, the, ganges, valley, along, with, the, growth, of, population, and, trade, networks, these, social, and, economic, changes, put, pressure, on, older, ways, of, life, setting, the, stage, for, the, upanishads, and, the, subsequent, rama, a, movements, and, the, end, of, the, vedic, period, which, was, followed, by, the, mahajanapada, period, according, to, george, erdosy, archaeological, data, for, the, period, from, 1000, to, 600, bce, shows, a, two, tiered, settlement, pattern, in, the, ganges, valley, with, some, modest, central, places, suggestive, of, the, existence, of, simple, chiefdoms, with, the, kurukshetra, district, itself, displaying, a, more, complex, albeit, not, yet, urbanized, three, tiered, hierarchy, subsequently, after, 600, bce, there, are, four, tiers, of, site, sizes, including, large, towns, and, fortified, cities, consistent, with, an, urbanized, state, level, society, economy, in, the, vedic, period, was, sustained, by, a, combination, of, pastoralism, and, agriculture, there, are, references, in, the, rigveda, to, the, leveling, of, fields, seed, processing, and, storage, of, grains, in, large, jars, war, bounty, was, also, a, major, source, of, wealth, economic, exchanges, were, conducted, by, gift, giving, particularly, to, kings, bali, and, priests, dana, and, barter, using, cattle, as, a, unit, of, currency, while, gold, is, mentioned, in, some, hymns, there, is, no, indication, of, the, use, of, coins, metallurgy, is, not, mentioned, in, the, rigveda, but, the, word, ayas, and, instruments, made, from, it, such, as, razors, bangles, axes, are, mentioned, one, verse, mentions, purification, of, ayas, some, scholars, believe, that, ayas, refers, to, iron, and, the, words, dham, and, karmara, refer, to, iron, welders, however, philological, evidence, indicates, that, ayas, in, the, rigveda, refers, only, to, copper, and, bronze, while, iron, or, y, ma, ayas, literally, black, metal, first, is, mentioned, in, the, post, rigvedic, atharvaveda, and, therefore, the, early, vedic, period, was, a, bronze, age, culture, whereas, the, late, vedic, period, was, an, iron, age, culture, the, transition, of, vedic, society, from, semi, nomadic, life, to, settled, agriculture, in, the, later, vedic, age, led, to, an, increase, in, trade, and, competition, for,

of, indian, philosophy, espoused, later, like, dharma, karma, etc, trace, their, root, to, the, vedas, the, main, deities, of, the, vedic, pantheon, were, indra, agni, the, sacrificial, fire, and,

the, two, strong, traces, of, a, common, indo, iranian, religion, remain, visible, especially, in, the, soma, cult, and, the, fire, worship, both, of, which, are, preserved, in, zoroastrianism, ethics, in, the, vedas, are, based, on, the, concepts, of, satya, and, rta, satya, is, the, principle, of, integration, rooted, in, the, absolute, whereas, ta, is, the, expression, of, satya, which,

ascetic, and, devotional, traditions, like, yoga, and, vedanta, acknowledge, the, authority, of, the, vedas, but, interpret, the, vedic, pantheon, as, a, unitary, view, of, the, universe, with, god, brahman, seen, as, immanent, and, transcendent, in, the, forms, of, ishvara, and, brahman, later, texts, such, as, the, upanishads, and, epics, namely, the, gita, of, mahabharata, are, essential, parts, of, these, later, developments, the, reconstruction, of, the, history, of, vedic, india, is, based, on, text, internal, details, but, can, be, correlated, to, relevant, archaeological, details, linguistically, the, vedic, texts, could, be, classified, in, five, chronological, strata, in, northern, india, some, very, early, depictions, of, deities, appear, in, the, art, of, the, indus, valley, civilisation, but, the, following, millennium, coinciding, with, the, indo, aryan, migration, during, the, vedic, period, is, devoid, of, such, remains, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, early, vedic, religion, focused, exclusively, on, the, worship, of, purely, elementary, forces, of, nature, by, means, of, elaborate, sacrifices, which, did, not, lend, themselves, easily, to, anthropomorphological, representations, various, artefacts, may, belong, to, the, copper, hoard, culture, 2nd, millennium, ce, some, of, them, suggesting, anthropomorphological, characteristics, interpretations, vary, as, to, the, exact, signification, of, these, artifacts, or, even, the, culture, and, the, periodization, to, which, they, belonged, some, examples, of, artistic, expression, also, appear, in, abstract, pottery, designs, during, the, black, and, red, ware, culture, 1450, 1200, bce, or, the, painted, grey, ware, culture, 1200, 600, bce, with, finds, in, a, wide, area, including, the, area, of, mathura, archaeological, cultures, identified, with, phases, of, vedic, material, culture, include, the, ochre, coloured, pottery, culture, the, gandhara, grave, culture, the, black, and, red, ware, culture, and, the, painted, grey, ware, culture, ochre, coloured, pottery, culture, was, first, found, approximately, between, 1950, and, 1951, in, western, uttar, pradesh, in, the, badaun, and, bisjuar, district, it, is, thought, that, this, culture, was, prominent, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 2nd, millennium, within, the, transition, between, the, indus, valley, civilization, and, the, end, of, harrapan, culture, this, pottery, is, typically, created, with, wheel, ware, and, is, ill, fired, to, a, fine, to, medium, fabric, decorated, with, a, red, slip, and, occasional, black, bands1, when, this, pottery, was, worked, with, it, often, left, an, ochre, color, on, the, hands, most, likely, because, of, water, logging, bad, firing, wind, action, or, a, mixture, of, these, factors, this, pottery, was, found, all, throughout, the, doab, most, of, it, found, in, the, muzaffarnagar, meerut, and, bulandshahr, districts, but, also, existing, outside, these, districts, extending, north, and, south, of, bahadrabad, this, pottery, does, however, seem, to, exist, within, different, time, frames, of, popularity, ochre, colored, pottery, seeming, to, occur, in, areas, such, as, rajasthan, earlier, than, we, see, it, in, the, doab, despite, the, doab, being, heavily, associated, with, the, culture, gandhara, grave, culture, refers, to, the, protohistoric, cemeteries, found, in, the, gandhara, region, stretching, all, the, way, from, bajuar, to, the, indus, these, cemeteries, seem, to, follow, a, set, grave, structure, and, mortuary, practice, such, as, inflexed, inhumation, and, cremation, this, culture, is, thought, to, occur, in, 3, stages, the, lower, in, which, burials, take, place, in, masonry, lined, pits, the, upper, in, which, urn, burials, and, cremations, are, added, and, the, surface, level, in, which, graves, are, covered, with, huge, stone, slabs, in, the, lower, stage, excavators, found, that, these, graves, are, typically, 2, 3, feet, deep, and, covered, with, stones, on, top, after, digging, out, the, stones, skeletons, were, found, facing, southwest, to, northeast, with, the, head, facing, one, direction, and, the, hands, laying, on, top, of, one, another, female, skeletons, were, often, found, wearing, hair, pins, and, jewelry, pottery, is, greatly, important, to, this, culture, as, pottery, was, often, used, as, a, grave, good, being, buried, with, the, bodies, of, the, dead, buried, alongside, the, skeletons, we, typically, see, various, pots, on, top, of, the, body, averaging, at, about, 5, or, less, pieces, of, pottery, per, grave, within, this, culture, we, typically, see, two, kinds, of, pottery, gray, ware, or, red, ware, black, and, red, ware, culture, was, coined, as, a, term, in, 1946, by, sir, mortimer, wheeler, the, pottery, as, the, name, suggests, typically, has, a, black, rim, inside, surface, and, a, red, lower, half, on, the, outside, of, the, piece, red, ware, pottery, tends, to, fall, into, two, categories, offering, stands, or, cooking, vessels, most, of, these, pieces, of, pottery, were, open, mouthed, bowls, that, were, burnished, painted, or, slipped, on, one, side, however, jars, pots, and, dishes, on, stands, have, also, been, found, in, small, quantities, black, and, red, ware, and, the, surrounding, culture, began, its, spread, during, the, neolithic, period, and, continues, until, the, early, medieval, period, in, india, as, well, as, being, found, in, parts, of, west, asia, and, egypt, there, are, many, theories, about, the, process, of, its, creation, the, most, popular, being, the, use, of, an, inverted, firing, technique, or, a, simultaneous, oxidation, and, reduction, firing, painted, grey, ware, culture, is, a, significant, pottery, style, that, has, been, linked, to, a, group, of, people, who, settled, in, sutlej, ghagger, and, the, upper, ganga, yamuna, valleys, loosely, classified, with, the, early, aryans, who, migrated, to, india, in, the, beginning, of, the, vedic, period, it, s, also, thought, that, the, groups, that, introduced, the, painted, grey, ware, culture, also, brought, iron, technology, to, the, indo, gangetic, plains, making, this, pottery, a, momentous, mark, of, the, northern, indian, iron, age, the, style, of, grey, ware, often, includes, clay, wheel, thrown, into, a, smooth, texture, ash, grey, in, color, and, often, decorated, with, black, ink, creating, small, circular, patterns, sometimes, spirals, swastikas, or, sigmas, grey, ware, pottery, is, almost, exclusively, drinking, ware, and, tends, to, have, three, different, forms, narrow, waisted, tall, drinking, glasses, middle, sized, drinking, goblets, and, drinking, vases, with, outturned, lips, there, was, a, distinct, grey, ware, culture, surrounding, the, establishment, of, the, pottery, but, while, the, culture, is, significant, grey, ware, has, only, made, up, 10, 15, of, found, vedic, pottery, a, majority, of, the, pottery, red, ware, as, grey, ware, pottery, was, seen, as, a, highly, valued, luxury, the, puranic, chronology, the, timeline, of, events, in, ancient, indian, history, and, mythology, as, narrated, in, post, vedic, hindu, texts, such, as, the, mahabharata, the, ramayana, and, the, puranas, envisions, a, much, older, chronology, for, the, vedic, culture, in, this, view, the, vedas, were, received, by, the, seven, rishis, thousands, of, years, ago, the, start, of, the, reign, of, vaivasvata, manu, the, manu, of, the, current, kalpa, aeon, and, the, progenitor, of, humanity, is, dated, by, some, as, far, back, 7350, bce, the, kurukshetra, war, the, background, scene, of, the, bhagavad, gita, which, may, relate, historical, events, taking, place, ca, 1000,
