is, now, the, territory, of, colombia, as, early, as, the, 1500s, however, secret, anti, spanish, discontentment, was, already, brewing, for, colombians, since, spain, prohibited, direct, trade, between, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, which, included, colombia, and, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, which, included, the, philippines, the, source, of, asian, products, like, silk, and, porcelain, which, was, in, demand, in, the, americas, illegal, trade, between, peruvians, filipinos, and, mexicans, continued, in, secret, as, smuggled, asian, goods, ended, up, in, c, rdoba, colombia, the,

disobeying, the, forced, spanish, monopoly, in, more, expensive, silks, and, porcelain, made, in, homeland, spain, in, 1717, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, was, originally, created, and, then, it, was, temporarily, removed, to, finally, be, reestablished, in, 1739, the, viceroyalty, had, santa, f, de, bogot, as, its, capital, this, viceroyalty, included, some, other, provinces, of, northwestern, south, america, which, had, previously, been, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, viceroyalties, of, new, spain, or, peru, and, correspond, mainly, to, today, s, venezuela, ecuador, and, panama, so, bogot, became, one, of, the, principal, administrative, centers, of, the, spanish, possessions, in, the, new, world, along, with, lima, and, mexico, city, from, then, on, the, long, independence, struggle, was, led, mainly, by, bol, var, and, francisco, de, paula, santander, in, neighboring, venezuela, bol, var, returned, to, new, granada, only, in, 1819, after, establishing, himself, as, leader, of, the, pro, independence, forces, in, the, venezuelan, llanos, from, there, he, led, an, army, over, the, andes, and, captured, new, granada, after, a, quick, campaign, that, ended, at, the, battle, of, boyac, on, august, 7, 1819, for, more, information, see, military, career, of, sim, n, bol, var, that, year, the, congress, of, angostura, established, the, republic, of, gran, colombia, which, included, all, territories, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, former, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, bol, var, was, elected, the, first, president, of, gran, colombia, and, santander, vice, president, as, the, federation, of, gran, colombia, was, dissolved, in, 1830, the, department, of, cundinamarca, as, established, in, angostura, became, a, new, country, the, republic, of, new, granada, in, 1863, the, name, of, the, republic, was, changed, officially, to, united, states, of, colombia, and, in, 1886, the, country, adopted, its, present, name, republic, of, colombia, two, political, parties, grew, out, of, conflicts, between, the, followers, of, bol, var, and, santander, and, their, political, visions, the, conservatives, and, the, liberals, and, have, since, dominated, colombian, politics, bol, var, s, supporters, who, later, formed, the, nucleus, of, the, conservative, party, sought, strong, centralized, government, alliance, with, the, roman, catholic, church, and, a, limited, franchise, santander, s, followers, forerunners, of, the, liberals, wanted, a, decentralized, government, state, rather, than, church, control, over, education, and, other, civil, matters, and, a, broadened, suffrage, throughout, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, each, party, held, the, presidency, for, roughly, equal, periods, of, time, colombia, maintained, a, tradition, of, civilian, government, and, regular, free, elections, the, military, has, seized, power, three, times, in, colombia, s, history, in, 1830, after, the, dissolution, of, great, colombia, again, in, 1854, by, general, jos, mar, a, melo, and, from, 1953, to, 1957, under, general, gustavo, rojas, pinilla, civilian, rule, was, restored, within, one, year, in, the, first, two, instances, notwithstanding, the, country, s, commitment, to, democratic, institutions, colombia, s, history, has, also, been, characterized, by, widespread, violent, conflict, two, civil, wars, resulted, from, bitter, rivalry, between, the, conservative, and, liberal, parties, the, thousand, days, war, 1899, 1902, cost, an, estimated, 100, 000, lives, and, up, to, 300, 000, people, died, during, la, violencia, of, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, a, bipartisan, confrontation, which, erupted, after, the, assassination, of, liberal, popular, candidate, jorge, eli, cer, gait, n, united, states, activity, to, influence, the, area, especially, the, panama, canal, construction, and, control, led, to, a, military, uprising, in, the, isthmus, department, in, 1903, which, resulted, in, the, separation, and, independence, of, panama, a, military, coup, in, 1953, toppled, the, right, wing, government, of, conservative, laureano, g, mez, and, brought, general, gustavo, rojas, pinilla, to, power, initially, rojas, enjoyed, considerable, popular, support, due, largely, to, his, success, in, reducing, la, violencia, when, he, did, not, restore, democratic, rule, and, occasionally, engaged, in, open, repression, however, he, was, overthrown, by, the, military, in, 1957, with, the, backing, of, both, political, parties, and, a, provisional, government, was, installed, in, july, 1957, former, conservative, president, laureano, g, mez, 1950, 1953, and, former, liberal, president, alberto, lleras, 1945, 1946, 1958, 1962, issued, the, declaration, of, sitges, in, which, they, proposed, a, national, front, whereby, the, liberal, and, conservative, parties, would, govern, jointly, the, presidency, would, be, determined, by, an, alternating, conservative, and, liberal, president, every, 4, years, for, 16, years, the, two, parties, would, have, parity, in, all, other, elective, offices, the, national, front, ended, la, violencia, and, national, front, administrations, attempted, to, institute, far, reaching, social, and, economic, reforms, in, cooperation, with, the, alliance, for, progress, in, particular, the, liberal, president, alberto, lleras, camargo, 1958, 1962, created, the, colombian, institute, for, agrarian, reform, incora, and, carlos, lleras, restrepo, 1966, 1970, further, developed, land, entitlement, in, 1968, and, 1969, alone, the, incora, issued, more, than, 60, 000, land, titles, to, farmers, and, workers, in, the, end, the, contradictions, between, each, successive, liberal, and, conservative, administration, made, the, results, decidedly, mixed, despite, the, progress, in, certain, sectors, many, social, and, political, injustices, continued, the, national, front, system, itself, eventually, began, to, be, seen, as, a, form, of, political, repression, by, dissidents, and, even, many, mainstream, voters, and, many, protesters, were, victimized, during, this, period, especially, after, what, was, later, confirmed, as, the, fraudulent, election, of, conservative, candidate, misael, pastrana, in, 1970, which, resulted, in, the, defeat, of, the, relatively, populist, candidate, and, former, president, dictator, gustavo, rojas, pinilla, the, m, 19, guerrilla, movement, movimiento, 19, de, abril, 19, april, movement, would, eventually, be, founded, in, part, as, a, response, to, this, particular, event, the, farc, was, formed, in, 1964, by, manuel, marulanda, v, lez, and, other, marxist, leninist, supporters, after, a, military, attack, on, the, community, of, marquetalia, although, the, system, established, by, the, sitges, agreement, was, phased, out, by, 1974, the, 1886, colombian, constitution, in, effect, until, 1991, required, that, the, losing, political, party, be, given, adequate, and, equitable, participation, in, the, government, which, according, to, many, observers, and, later, analysis, eventually, resulted, in, some, increase, in, corruption, and, legal, relaxation, the, current, 1991, constitution, does, not, have, that, requirement, but, subsequent, administrations, have, tended, to, include, members, of, opposition, parties, from, 1974, until, 1982, different, presidential, administrations, chose, to, focus, on, ending, the, persistent, insurgencies, that, sought, to, undermine, colombia, s, traditional, political, system, both, groups, claimed, to, represent, the, poor, and, weak, against, the, rich, and, powerful, classes, of, the, country, demanding, the, completion, of, true, land, and, political, reform, from, an, openly, communist, perspective, by, 1974, another, challenge, to, the, state, s, authority, and, legitimacy, had, come, from, 19th, of, april, movement, m, 19, a, mostly, urban, guerrilla, group, founded, in, response, to, an, alleged, electoral, fraud, during, the, final, national, front, election, of, misael, pastrana, borrero, 1970, 1974, and, the, defeat, of, former, dictator, gustavo, rojas, pinilla, initially, the, m, 19, attracted, a, degree, of, attention, and, sympathy, from, mainstream, colombians, that, the, farc, and, national, liberation, army, eln, had, found, largely, elusive, earlier, due, to, extravagant, and, daring, operations, such, as, stealing, a, sword, that, had, belonged, to, colombia, s, independence, hero, simon, bol, var, at, the, same, time, its, larger, profile, soon, made, it, the, focus, of, the, state, s, counterinsurgency, efforts, the, eln, guerrilla, had, been, seriously, crippled, by, military, operations, in, the, region, of, anor, by, 1974, but, it, managed, to, reconstitute, itself, and, escape, destruction, in, part, due, to, the, administration, of, alfonso, l, pez, michelsen, 1974, 1978, allowing, it, to, escape, encirclement, hoping, to, initiate, a, peace, process, with, the, group, by, 1982, the, perceived, passivity, of, the, farc, together, with, the, relative, success, of, the, government, s, efforts, against, the, m, 19, and, eln, enabled, the, administration, of, the, liberal, party, s, julio, c, sar, turbay, 1978, 1982, to, lift, a, state, of, siege, decree, that, had, been, in, effect, on, and, off, for, most, of, the, previous, 30, years, under, the, latest, such, decree, president, turbay, had, implemented, security, policies, that, though, of, some, military, value, against, the, m, 19, in, particular, were, considered, highly, questionable, both, inside, and, outside, colombian, circles, due, to, numerous, accusations, of, military, human, rights, abuses, against, suspects, and, captured, guerrillas, citizen, exhaustion, due, to, the, conflict, s, newfound, intensity, led, to, the, election, of, president, belisario, betancur, 1982, 1986, a, conservative, who, won, 47, of, the, popular, vote, directed, peace, feelers, at, all, the, insurgents, and, negotiated, a, 1984, cease, fire, with, the, farc, and, m, 19, after, a, 1982, release, of, many, guerrillas, imprisoned, during, the, previous, effort, to, overpower, them, the, eln, rejected, entering, any, negotiation, and, continued, to, recover, itself, through, the, use, of, extortions, and, threats, in, particular, against, foreign, oil, companies, of, european, and, u, s, origin, as, these, events, were, developing, the, growing, illegal, drug, trade, and, its, consequences, were, also, increasingly, becoming, a, matter, of, widespread, importance, to, all, participants, in, the, colombian, conflict, guerrillas, and, newly, wealthy, drug, lords, had, mutually, uneven, relations, and, thus, numerous, incidents, occurred, between, them, eventually, the, kidnapping, of, drug, cartel, family, members, by, guerrillas, led, to, the, creation, of, the, 1981, muerte, a, secuestradores, mas, death, squad, death, to, kidnappers, pressure, from, the, u, s, government, and, critical, sectors, of, colombian, society, was, met, with, further, violence, as, the, medell, n, cartel, and, its, hitmen, bribed, or, murdered, numerous, public, officials, politicians, and, others, who, stood, in, its, way, by, supporting, the, implementation, of, extradition, of, colombian, nationals, to, the, u, s, victims, of, cartel, violence, included, justice, minister, rodrigo, lara, whose, assassination, in, 1984, made, the, betancur, administration, begin, to, directly, oppose, the, drug, lords, the, first, negotiated, cease, fire, with, the, m, 19, ended, when, the, guerrillas, resumed, fighting, in, 1985, claiming, that, the, cease, fire, had, not, been, fully, respected, by, official, security, forces, saying, that, several, of, its, members, had, suffered, threats, and, assaults, and, also, questioning, the, government, s, real, willingness, to, implement, any, accords, the, betancur, administration, in, turn, questioned, the, m, 19, s, actions, and, its, commitment, to, the, peace, process, as, it, continued, to, advance, high, profile, negotiations, with, the, farc, which, led, to, the, creation, of, the, patriotic, union, colombia, up, a, legal, and, non, clandestine, political, organization, on, november, 6, 1985, the, m, 19, stormed, the, colombian, palace, of, justice, and, held, the, supreme, court, magistrates, hostage, intending, to, put, president, betancur, on, trial, in, the, ensuing, crossfire, that, followed, the, military, s, reaction, scores, of, people, lost, their, lives, as, did, most, of, the, guerrillas, including, several, high, ranking, operatives, both, sides, blamed, each, other, for, the, outcome, meanwhile, individual, farc, members, initially, joined, the, up, leadership, in, representation, of, the, guerrilla, command, though, most, of, the, guerrilla, s, chiefs, and, militiamen, did, not, demobilize, nor, disarm, as, that, was, not, a, requirement, of, the, process, at, that, point, in, time, tension, soon, significantly, increased, as, both, sides, began, to, accuse, each, other, of, not, respecting, the, cease, fire, political, violence, against, farc, and, up, members, including, presidential, candidate, jaime, pardo, was, blamed, on, drug, lords, and, also, on, members, of, the, security, forces, to, a, much, lesser, degree, on, the, argued, inaction, of, betancur, administration, members, of, the, government, and, security, authorities, increasingly, accused, the, farc, of, continuing, to, recruit, guerrillas, as, well, as, kidnapping, extorting, and, politically, intimidating, voters, even, as, the, up, was, already, participating, in, politics, the, virgilio, barco, 1986, 1990, administration, in, addition, to, continuing, to, handle, the, difficulties, of, the, complex, negotiations, with, the, guerrillas, also, inherited, a, particularly, chaotic, confrontation, against, the, drug, lords, who, were, engaged, in, a, campaign, of, terrorism, and, murder, in, response, to, government, moves, in, favor, of, their, extradition, overseas, the, up, also, suffered, an, increasing, number, of, losses, during, this, term, including, the, assassination, of, presidential, candidate, bernardo, jaramillo, which, stemmed, both, from, private, proto, paramilitary, organizations, increasingly, powerful, drug, lords, and, a, number, of, would, be, paramilitary, sympathizers, within, the, armed, forces, following, administrations, had, to, contend, with, the, guerrillas, paramilitaries, narcotics, traffickers, and, the, violence, and, corruption, that, they, all, perpetuated, both, through, force, and, negotiation, narcoterrorists, assassinated, three, presidential, candidates, before, c, sar, gaviria, was, elected, in, 1990, since, the, death, of, medell, n, cartel, leader, pablo, escobar, in, a, police, shootout, during, december, 1993, indiscriminate, acts, of, violence, associated, with, that, organization, have, abated, as, the, cartels, have, broken, up, into, multiple, smaller, and, often, competing, trafficking, organizations, nevertheless, violence, continues, as, these, drug, organizations, resort, to, violence, as, part, of, their, operations, but, also, to, protest, government, policies, including, extradition, the, m, 19, and, several, smaller, guerrilla, groups, were, successfully, incorporated, into, a, peace, process, as, the, 1980s, ended, and, the, 1990s, began, which, culminated, in, the, elections, for, a, constituent, assembly, of, colombia, that, would, write, a, new, constitution, which, took, effect, in, 1991, the, new, constitution, brought, about, a, considerable, number, of, institutional, and, legal, reforms, based, on, principles, that, the, delegates, considered, as, more, modern, humanist, democratic, and, politically, open, than, those, in, the, 1886, constitution, practical, results, were, mixed, and, mingled, emerged, such, as, the, debate, surrounding, the, constitutional, prohibition, of, extradition, which, later, was, reversed, but, together, with, the, reincorporation, of, some, of, the, guerrilla, groups, to, the, legal, political, framework, the, new, constitution, inaugurated, an, era, that, was, both, a, continuation, and, a, gradual, but, significant, departure, from, what, had, come, before, contacts, with, the, farc, which, had, irregularly, continued, despite, the, generalized, de, facto, interruptions, of, the, ceasefire, and, the, official, 1987, break, from, negotiations, were, temporarily, cut, off, in, 1990, under, the, presidency, of, c, sar, gaviria, 1990, 1994, the, colombian, army, s, assault, on, the, farc, s, casa, verde, sanctuary, at, la, uribe, meta, followed, by, a, farc, offensive, that, sought, to, undermine, the, deliberations, of, the, constitutional, assembly, began, to, highlight, a, significant, break, in, the, uneven, negotiations, carried, over, from, the, previous, decade, president, ernesto, samper, assumed, office, in, august, 1994, however, a, political, crisis, relating, to, large, scale, contributions, from, drug, traffickers, to, samper, s, presidential, campaign, diverted, attention, from, governance, programs, thus, slowing, and, in, many, cases, halting, progress, on, the, nation, s, domestic, reform, agenda, the, military, also, suffered, several, setbacks, in, its, fight, against, the, guerrillas, when, several, of, its, rural, bases, began, to, be, overrun, and, a, record, number, of, soldiers, and, officers, were, taken, prisoner, by, the, farc, which, since, 1982, was, attempting, to, implement, a, more, conventional, style, of, warfare, seeking, to, eventually, defeat, the, military, in, the, field, on, august, 7, 1998, andr, s, pastrana, was, sworn, in, as, the, president, of, colombia, a, member, of, the, conservative, party, pastrana, defeated, liberal, party, candidate, horacio, serpa, in, a, run, off, election, marked, by, high, voter, turnout, and, little, political, unrest, the, new, president, s, program, was, based, on, a, commitment, to, bring, about, a, peaceful, resolution, of, colombia, s, longstanding, civil, conflict, and, to, cooperate, fully, with, the, united, states, to, combat, the, trafficking, of, illegal, drugs, while, early, initiatives, in, the, colombian, peace, process, gave, reason, for, optimism, the, pastrana, administration, also, has, had, to, combat, high, unemployment, and, other, economic, problems, such, as, the, fiscal, deficit, and, the, impact, of, global, financial, instability, on, colombia, during, his, administration, unemployment, has, risen, to, over, 20, additionally, the, growing, severity, of, countrywide, guerrilla, attacks, by, the, farc, and, eln, and, smaller, movements, as, well, as, the, growth, of, drug, production, corruption, and, the, spread, of, even, more, violent, paramilitary, groups, such, as, the, united, self, defense, forces, of, colombia, auc, has, made, it, difficult, to, solve, the, country, s, problems, although, the, farc, and, eln, accepted, participation, in, the, peace, process, they, did, not, make, explicit, commitments, to, end, the, conflict, the, farc, suspended, talks, in, november, 2000, to, protest, what, it, called, paramilitary, terrorism, but, returned, to, the, negotiating, table, in, february, 2001, following, 2, days, of, meetings, between, president, pastrana, and, farc, leader, manuel, marulanda, the, colombian, government, and, eln, in, early, 2001, continued, discussions, aimed, at, opening, a, formal, peace, process, by, 2004, the, security, situation, of, colombia, had, shown, some, measure, of, an, improvement, and, the, economy, while, still, fragile, had, also, shown, some, positive, signs, on, the, other, hand, relatively, little, had, been, accomplished, in, structurally, solving, most, of, the, country, s, other, grave, problems, in, part, due, to, legislative, and, political, conflicts, between, the, administration, and, the, colombian, congress, including, those, over, the, controversial, 2006, project, to, give, president, lvaro, uribe, the, right, to, be, re, elected, and, a, relative, lack, of, freely, allocated, funds, and, credits, in, october, 2006, uribe, was, re, elected, by, a, landslide, some, critical, observers, consider, in, retrospect, that, uribe, s, policies, while, admittedly, reducing, crime, and, guerrilla, activity, were, too, slanted, in, favor, of, a, military, solution, to, colombia, s, internal, war, neglecting, grave, social, and, human, rights, concerns, to, a, certain, extent, they, hoped, that, uribe, s, government, would, make, serious, efforts, towards, improving, the, human, rights, situation, inside, the, country, protecting, civilians, and, reducing, any, abuses, committed, by, the, armed, forces, uribe, s, supporters, in, turn, believed, that, increased, military, action, was, a, necessary, prelude, to, any, serious, negotiation, attempt, with, the, guerrillas, and, that, the, increased, security, situation, would, help, the, government, in, the, long, term, to, focus, more, actively, on, reducing, most, wide, scale, abuses, and, human, rights, violations, on, the, part, of, both, the, armed, groups, and, any, rogue, security, forces, that, might, have, links, to, the, paramilitaries, in, short, these, supporters, maintained, that, the, security, situation, needed, to, be, stabilized, in, favor, of, the, government, before, any, other, social, concerns, could, take, precedence, in, february, 2010, the, constitutional, court, blocked, president, alvaro, uribe, from, seeking, for, a, new, re, election, uribe, left, the, presidency, in, 2010, in, 2010, juan, manuel, santos, was, elected, president, he, was, supported, by, ex, president, uribe, and, he, owed, his, election, mainly, through, having, won, over, former, uribe, supporters, but, two, years, after, winning, the, presidential, election, santos, to, widespread, surprise, began, peace, talks, with, farc, which, took, place, in, havana, re, elected, in, 2014, santos, revived, an, important, infrastructure, program, which, had, been, planned, during, the, uribe, administration, focused, mainly, on, the, provision, of, national, highways, the, program, was,
