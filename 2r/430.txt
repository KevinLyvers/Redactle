the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, was, a, european, conflict, fought, between, 1740, and, 1748, primarily, in, central, europe, the, austrian, netherlands, italy, the, atlantic, ocean, and, mediterranean, sea, related, conflicts, include, king, george, s, war, in, north, america, the, war, of, jenkins, ear, the, first, carnatic, war, and, the, first, and, second, silesian, wars, its, pretext, was, the, right, of, maria, theresa, to, succeed, her, father, emperor, charles, vi, as, ruler, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, france, prussia, and, bavaria, saw, it, as, an, opportunity, to, challenge, habsburg, power, while, maria, theresa, was, backed, by, britain, the, dutch, republic, and, hanover, collectively, known, as, the, pragmatic, allies, as, the, conflict, widened, it, drew, in, other, participants, among, them, spain, sardinia, saxony, sweden, and, russia, prussia, occupied, the, austrian, province, of, silesia, in, 1740, although, austria, and, sardinia, defeated, spanish, attacks, in, northern, italy, by, early, 1748, france, held, most, of, the, austrian, netherlands, but, was, close, to, bankruptcy, due, to, the, cost, of, the, war, and, a, crippling, british, naval, blockade, the, stalemate, led, to, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, which, confirmed, maria, theresa, in, her, titles, but, failed, to, resolve, underlying, tensions, between, the, signatories, many, of, whom, were, unhappy, with, the, terms, france, achieved, minimal, gains, for, vast, expenditure, while, the, spanish, gained, the, duchies, of, parma, piacenza, and, guastalla, prussia, often, considered, the, clearest, winner, acquired, silesia, from, austria, an, outcome, that, undermined, the, long, standing, anglo, austrian, alliance, since, maria, theresa, deeply, resented, britain, s, insistence, she, cede, silesia, to, make, peace, and, made, it, her, main, objective, to, regain, it, at, the, same, time, the, war, demonstrated, that, hanover, then, held, in, personal, union, with, the, british, crown, was, vulnerable, to, prussian, attacks, while, many, british, politicians, felt, they, received, little, benefit, from, the, enormous, subsidies, paid, to, austria, the, result, was, the, realignment, known, as, the, diplomatic, revolution, austria, and, france, ended, the, rivalry, which, had, dominated, european, affairs, for, centuries, while, prussia, allied, with, great, britain, these, changes, set, the, scene, for, the, outbreak, of, the, seven, years, war, in, 1756, the, immediate, cause, of, the, war, was, the, death, in, 1740, of, emperor, charles, vi, 1685, 1740, and, the, inheritance, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, often, collectively, referred, to, as, austria, the, 1703, mutual, pact, of, succession, provided, that, if, the, habsburgs, became, extinct, in, the, male, line, these, possessions, would, go, first, to, maria, josepha, and, maria, amalia, daughters, of, emperor, joseph, i, then, those, of, charles, his, younger, brother, since, salic, law, excluded, women, from, the, inheritance, this, agreement, required, approval, by, the, various, habsburg, territories, and, the, imperial, diet, charles, succeeded, joseph, in, 1711, and, two, years, later, issued, the, pragmatic, sanction, of, 1713, which, confirmed, the, principle, of, female, inheritance, however, it, also, modified, the, 1703, agreement, by, placing, the, rights, of, his, own, children, first, and, after, his, first, child, maria, theresa, was, born, in, 1717, charles, internal, and, external, policy, was, dominated, by, ensuring, her, succession, ahead, of, his, two, nieces, prior, to, their, respective, marriages, to, frederick, augustus, of, saxony, and, charles, albert, of, bavaria, in, 1719, both, nieces, were, obliged, to, formally, renounce, their, rights, to, the, inheritance, charles, assumed, the, rivalry, between, saxony, and, bavaria, would, secure, his, daughter, s, throne, since, neither, would, be, prepared, to, allow, the, other, to, inherit, but, instead, he, gave, his, two, greatest, rivals, a, claim, to, the, habsburg, lands, charles, was, also, seeking, to, ensure, the, succession, of, maria, theresa, not, just, to, her, family, lands, but, the, titles, and, powers, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, although, held, by, a, habsburg, for, over, 300, years, it, was, an, elective, position, and, could, not, be, held, by, a, woman, the, problem, was, exacerbated, by, tensions, within, the, holy, roman, empire, caused, by, dramatic, increases, in, the, size, and, power, of, bavaria, prussia, and, saxony, mirrored, by, the, post, 1683, expansion, of, habsburg, power, into, lands, previously, held, by, the, ottoman, empire, these, were, the, centrifugal, forces, behind, a, war, that, reshaped, the, traditional, european, balance, of, power, the, various, legal, claims, were, largely, pretexts, and, seen, as, such, bavaria, and, saxony, refused, to, be, bound, by, the, decision, of, the, imperial, diet, while, in, 1738, france, agreed, to, back, the, just, claims, of, charles, albert, of, bavaria, despite, previously, accepting, the, pragmatic, sanction, in, 1735, attempts, to, offset, this, involved, austria, in, the, 1733, 1735, war, of, the, polish, succession, and, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1735, 1739, and, it, was, weakened, by, the, losses, incurred, the, situation, was, compounded, by, a, failure, to, prepare, maria, theresa, for, her, new, role, and, many, european, statesmen, were, sceptical, austria, could, survive, the, contest, that, would, follow, charles, death, which, finally, came, about, in, october, 1740, on, land, fighting, focused, on, three, main, theatres, central, europe, italy, and, the, austrian, netherlands, along, with, a, wider, naval, conflict, the, war, itself, can, be, divided, into, three, separate, but, connected, conflicts, the, first, being, the, silesian, wars, between, prussia, and, austria, in, the, second, austria, and, sardinia, defeated, spanish, attacks, in, northern, italy, while, the, third, featured, an, increasingly, global, contest, between, britain, and, france, in, the, end, french, conquest, of, the, austrian, netherlands, gave, them, clear, dominance, on, land, while, britain, s, victories, at, sea, cemented, its, place, as, the, dominant, naval, power, for, much, of, the, 18th, century, french, military, strategy, focused, on, potential, threats, on, its, eastern, and, northern, borders, which, required, a, strong, land, army, its, colonies, were, left, to, fend, for, themselves, or, given, minimal, resources, anticipating, they, would, likely, be, lost, anyway, this, strategy, was, driven, by, a, combination, of, geography, and, the, superiority, of, the, british, navy, which, made, it, difficult, for, the, french, navy, to, provide, significant, supplies, and, support, to, french, colonies, the, expectation, was, military, victory, in, europe, would, compensate, for, any, colonial, losses, in, 1748, france, recovered, possessions, like, louisbourg, in, return, for, withdrawing, from, the, austrian, netherlands, the, british, tried, to, avoid, large, scale, commitments, of, troops, on, the, continent, they, sought, to, offset, the, disadvantage, this, created, in, europe, by, allying, themselves, with, one, or, more, continental, powers, whose, interests, were, antithetical, to, those, of, their, enemies, particularly, france, in, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, the, british, were, allied, with, austria, by, the, time, of, the, seven, years, war, they, were, allied, with, its, enemy, prussia, in, contrast, to, france, once, britain, became, engaged, in, the, war, it, took, advantage, of, the, royal, navy, to, expand, it, into, the, colonies, the, british, pursued, a, dual, strategy, of, naval, blockade, and, bombardment, of, enemy, ports, and, also, utilized, their, ability, to, move, troops, by, sea, to, the, utmost, they, would, harass, enemy, shipping, and, attack, enemy, outposts, frequently, using, colonists, from, nearby, british, colonies, in, the, effort, this, plan, worked, better, in, north, america, than, in, europe, but, set, the, stage, for, the, seven, years, war, frederick, ii, succeeded, his, father, frederick, william, as, king, of, prussia, on, 31, may, 1740, at, the, age, of, 28, although, prussia, had, increased, in, importance, over, the, prior, few, decades, its, disparate, and, scattered, territories, prevented, it, wielding, significant, power, a, reality, frederick, intended, to, change, the, death, of, emperor, charles, vi, on, 20, october, 1740, provided, him, with, an, ideal, opportunity, to, acquire, silesia, but, he, needed, to, do, so, before, augustus, of, saxony, and, poland, could, pre, empt, him, with, a, population, of, 16, million, austria, had, an, authorised, standing, army, of, 157, 000, although, financial, restraints, meant, its, true, size, was, considerably, less, than, that, in, 1740, since, they, had, a, much, greater, area, to, defend, their, army, was, more, of, a, sieve, than, a, shield, against, foreign, invasion, in, contrast, the, prussian, army, was, better, trained, and, led, than, its, opponents, while, its, standing, army, of, 80, 000, was, disproportionately, large, at, around, 4, of, its, 2, 2, million, population, to, add, to, these, advantages, in, april, 1739, frederick, ensured, austria, faced, war, on, two, fronts, when, louis, xv, of, france, agreed, to, attack, from, the, west, while, prussia, did, so, from, the, north, in, early, december, 1740, the, prussian, army, assembled, along, the, river, oder, and, on, 16, december, invaded, silesia, without, a, formal, declaration, of, war, since, austrian, military, resources, were, concentrated, in, hungary, and, italy, they, had, fewer, than, 3, 000, troops, in, silesia, although, this, increased, to, 7, 000, shortly, before, the, invasion, they, held, onto, the, fortresses, of, glogau, breslau, and, brieg, but, abandoned, the, rest, of, the, province, and, withdrew, into, moravia, with, both, sides, taking, up, winter, quarters, in, under, two, weeks, prussia, had, occupied, most, of, the, richest, province, in, the, holy, roman, empire, containing, a, population, of, over, one, million, the, commercial, centre, of, breslau, along, with, mining, weaving, and, dyeing, industries, however, frederick, underestimated, maria, theresa, s, determination, to, reverse, her, loss, while, the, retention, of, austrian, fortresses, in, southern, silesia, meant, a, quick, victory, could, not, be, achieved, early, in, the, year, an, austrian, army, under, von, neipperg, relieved, neisse, and, marched, on, brieg, threatening, to, cut, the, prussians, off, on, 10, april, just, outside, brieg, they, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, mollwitz, frederick, made, serious, mistakes, in, his, first, battle, and, was, so, close, to, defeat, that, his, subordinates, ordered, him, to, avoid, capture, and, leave, the, battlefield, his, deputy, von, schwerin, managed, to, drag, out, a, victory, both, sides, losing, nearly, 25, of, their, strength, on, 5, june, frederick, signed, an, alliance, against, austria, with, france, who, crossed, the, rhine, on, 15, august, a, combined, franco, bavarian, force, now, advanced, along, the, danube, towards, vienna, capturing, linz, on, 14, september, joined, by, a, saxon, army, of, 20, 000, they, advanced, on, prague, from, three, different, points, initially, meeting, little, resistance, before, long, the, austrians, had, an, army, at, t, bor, while, neipperg, was, recalled, from, silesia, to, defend, vienna, apparently, close, to, defeat, on, 21, september, maria, theresa, made, an, emotional, speech, to, the, hungarian, diet, in, pressburg, they, approved, a, lev, e, en, masse, which, ultimately, produced, 22, 000, troops, rather, than, the, promised, 60, 000, but, was, an, assertion, of, loyalty, long, remembered, maria, theresa, was, also, helped, by, deep, divisions, among, her, opponents, and, frederick, s, duplicity, hoping, to, weaken, saxony, on, 9, october, he, signed, the, klein, schnellendorf, agreement, with, neipperg, and, in, what, is, now, considered, a, memorable, act, of, diplomatic, subterfuge, the, austrians, surrendered, neisse, after, a, mock, defence, under, the, prevailing, rules, of, war, this, allowed, them, to, receive, a, pass, to, the, nearest, friendly, territory, and, thus, be, used, against, prussia, s, allies, elsewhere, rather, than, being, taken, prisoner, her, best, general, von, khevenh, ller, incorporated, them, into, an, army, being, assembled, for, a, winter, offensive, to, retake, upper, austria, and, attack, bavaria, while, frederick, completed, his, conquest, of, silesia, a, french, force, under, maurice, de, saxe, took, prague, on, 26, november, 1741, allowing, the, bavarian, elector, charles, albert, to, be, crowned, king, of, bohemia, the, year, ended, with, khevenh, ller, decisively, defeating, a, bigger, franco, bavarian, army, at, sankt, p, lten, and, advancing, up, the, danube, towards, linz, while, a, second, column, under, johann, b, renklau, moved, through, the, tyrol, towards, munich, on, 17, january, von, khevenh, ller, defeated, a, bavarian, army, at, sch, rding, while, seven, days, later, 10, 000, french, soldiers, surrendered, at, linz, on, 12, february, charles, albert, of, bavaria, was, crowned, emperor, charles, vii, the, first, non, habsburg, to, hold, the, position, in, 300, years, although, b, renklau, captured, munich, the, same, day, although, technically, all, allies, prussia, saxony, and, bavaria, had, no, desire, to, see, france, established, in, the, empire, nor, to, see, one, another, gain, relative, ground, maria, theresa, ended, austria, s, secret, truce, with, frederick, first, releasing, the, details, the, austrians, assembled, a, second, army, of, 28, 000, to, retake, prague, under, charles, of, lorraine, news, of, the, secret, truce, badly, damaged, the, relationship, between, frederick, and, his, allies, but, emperor, charles, asked, him, to, relieve, the, pressure, by, invading, moravia, frederick, had, used, the, interval, to, reorganise, his, cavalry, previously, neglected, in, favour, of, the, infantry, and, who, performed, poorly, at, mollwitz, they, would, prove, more, effective, in, the, 1742, campaign, in, december, 1741, von, schwerin, had, captured, olm, tz, frederick, took, glatz, before, moving, onto, gro, seelowitz, in, march, 1742, this, allowed, him, to, threaten, vienna, a, few, prussian, patrols, even, appeared, in, the, suburbs, before, withdrawing, in, early, may, he, took, the, offensive, and, moved, into, north, east, bohemia, by, 16, may, he, had, 10, 000, infantry, at, kuttenberg, and, another, 18, 000, men, under, leopold, of, anhalt, dessau, a, day, s, march, behind, on, the, afternoon, of, 16, may, charles, of, lorraine, s, cavalry, ran, into, leopold, s, rearguard, leopold, recognized, he, was, in, contact, with, the, austrian, main, force, and, so, accelerated, his, march, ahead, to, close, the, gap, with, frederick, at, 2, 00, am, on, 17, may, his, exhausted, troops, stopped, at, the, small, village, of, chotusitz, still, three, hours, from, kutn, hora, fought, later, the, same, day, the, battle, of, chotusitz, was, inconclusive, but, technically, a, prussian, victory, since, the, austrians, withdrew, on, 24, may, french, field, marshal, de, broglie, won, a, minor, action, at, sahay, the, two, victories, left, the, strategic, situation, unchanged, since, charles, was, still, able, to, move, against, prague, while, the, prussian, presence, in, moravia, remained, a, threat, to, vienna, however, habsburg, policy, was, generally, to, avoid, fighting, on, too, many, fronts, at, the, same, time, prussia, was, the, most, dangerous, and, most, difficult, to, defeat, although, recovering, silesia, remained, a, priority, for, decades, maria, theresa, was, willing, to, agree, a, temporary, truce, with, prussia, to, improve, her, position, elsewhere, this, suited, frederick, who, was, short, of, money, and, men, and, also, suspected, france, was, preparing, a, separate, peace, in, june, the, treaty, of, breslau, ended, the, first, silesian, war, prussian, troops, withdrew, from, bohemia, and, austria, recaptured, prague, in, december, at, the, beginning, of, the, year, louis, xv, insisted, broglie, be, given, command, of, the, franco, bavarian, forces, creating, tension, with, the, bavarians, and, their, general, von, seckendorff, with, most, of, his, lands, occupied, by, the, austrians, charles, vii, fled, to, augsburg, from, where, he, initiated, talks, with, vienna, and, london, feeling, he, had, been, abandoned, by, his, french, allies, divided, at, the, top, and, their, troops, weakened, by, disease, the, franco, bavarian, forces, offered, limited, resistance, to, the, austrian, advance, on, 9, may, the, bavarians, were, defeated, outside, simbach, by, charles, of, lorraine, in, mid, june, the, pragmatic, army, arrived, at, aschaffenburg, on, the, north, bank, of, the, river, main, here, they, were, joined, by, george, ii, who, was, attending, the, enthronement, of, a, new, elector, of, mainz, in, wiesbaden, by, late, june, the, allies, were, running, short, of, supplies, and, withdrew, towards, the, nearest, supply, depot, at, hanau, the, road, to, which, ran, through, dettingen, now, a, part, of, karlstein, am, main, where, 23, 000, french, troops, blocked, the, road, despite, a, strong, position, mistakes, made, by, their, commander, gramont, allowed, the, allies, to, win, a, narrow, victory, this, was, the, last, time, a, british, monarch, would, personally, lead, troops, in, battle, while, the, pragmatic, army, were, able, to, continue, their, retreat, they, had, to, abandon, their, wounded, and, although, reinforced, by, charles, of, lorraine, were, unable, to, agree, what, to, do, next, charles, later, described, allied, headquarters, as, a, republic, while, adrien, maurice, de, noailles, told, louis, xv, he, was, heavily, indebted, to, the, irresolutions, of, george, ii, they, ended, by, doing, nothing, and, in, october, took, up, winter, quarters, in, the, netherlands, frederick, had, responded, to, dettingen, by, renewing, his, search, for, allies, and, building, up, his, army, once, again, in, july, the, russian, court, discovered, an, alleged, plot, to, overthrow, empress, elizabeth, and, restore, three, year, old, ivan, vi, with, his, mother, grand, duchess, anna, leopoldovna, as, his, regent, whether, this, amounted, to, anything, more, than, drunken, gossip, is, disputed, one, suggestion, is, that, it, was, a, fabrication, by, frederick, designed, to, remove, anti, prussian, opponents, chiefly, chancellor, bestuzhev, ryumin, anna, bestuzhev, wife, of, his, brother, mikhail, and, her, friend, natalia, lopukhina, confessed, to, the, plot, after, 25, days, of, torture, they, were, publicly, flogged, and, had, their, tongues, removed, before, being, exiled, to, siberia, fredrick, s, supporters, referred, to, it, as, the, botta, conspiracy, alleging, the, involvement, of, austrian, envoy, antoniotto, botta, adorno, when, tsarina, elizabeth, demanded, botta, be, punished, maria, theresa, refused, and, the, episode, poisoned, the, relationship, between, austria, and, russia, frederick, managed, to, divide, his, two, main, opponents, but, alexey, bestuzhev, ryumin, remained, in, place, leaving, the, overall, position, unchanged, on, 13, september, charles, emmanuel, iii, of, sardinia, maria, theresa, and, britain, agreed, the, treaty, of, worms, intended, to, expel, spain, from, italy, in, return, for, sardinian, support, in, lombardy, the, austrians, ceded, all, their, territories, west, of, the, river, ticino, and, lake, maggiore, along, with, lands, south, of, the, po, in, return, charles, emmanuel, renounced, his, claim, to, the, strategic, duchy, of, milan, guaranteed, the, pragmatic, sanction, and, provided, 40, 000, troops, paid, for, by, britain, france, and, spain, responded, with, the, second, pacte, de, famille, in, october, and, louis, xv, began, plans, to, invade, the, austrian, netherlands, the, year, ended, with, saxony, agreeing, a, pact, of, mutual, defence, with, austria, leaving, prussia, isolated, and, facing, a, renewed, offensive, as, maria, theresa, sought, to, regain, silesia, under, the, 1743, treaty, of, fontainebleau, louis, xv, and, his, uncle, philip, v, of, spain, agreed, on, joint, action, against, britain, this, included, a, proposed, invasion, of, britain, aimed, at, restoring, the, exiled, stuarts, and, over, the, winter, 12, 000, french, troops, and, transports, were, assembled, at, dunkirk, in, the, february, 1744, battle, of, toulon, a, combined, franco, spanish, fleet, fought, an, indecisive, action, with, a, british, naval, force, commanded, by, admiral, mathews, although, mathews, prevented, them, exiting, the, mediterranean, and, supporting, the, invasion, attempt, he, was, forced, to, retreat, which, led, to, his, dismissal, success, allowed, spain, to, land, troops, in, northern, italy, and, in, april, they, captured, the, important, port, of, villefranche, sur, mer, then, part, of, savoy, however, storms, sank, or, severely, damaged, many, french, ships, while, most, of, louis, ministers, opposed, what, they, considered, an, expensive, and, futile, diversion, of, resources, the, invasion, was, cancelled, on, 11, march, louis, formally, declared, war, on, britain, and, in, may, a, french, army, invaded, the, austrian, netherlands, as, in, 1744, they, were, greatly, helped, by, divisions, between, the, pragmatic, allies, making, it, very, difficult, to, formulate, a, consistent, strategy, the, british, and, hanoverians, detested, each, other, austrian, resources, were, focused, in, alsace, while, the, dutch, were, reluctant, to, declare, war, on, france, and, unsuccessfully, tried, to, persuade, louis, to, withdraw, the, dutch, however, did, want, to, protect, their, barrier, fortresses, and, isaac, cronstr, m, thus, argued, to, engage, the, french, in, the, open, field, george, wade, supreme, commander, of, the, allied, army, disagreed, he, was, under, strict, orders, of, the, british, government, to, not, risk, losing, his, connection, to, ostend, and, not, to, risk, british, or, hanoverians, troops, becoming, prisoners, of, war, which, also, meant, that, he, refused, to, put, them, on, garrison, duty, the, british, feared, another, jacobite, uprising, and, therefore, wanted, to, be, able, to, send, their, troops, home, in, time, as, a, result, the, french, made, rapid, progress, quickly, capturing, most, of, the, dutch, held, barrier, fortresses, along, the, border, including, menen, and, ypres, when, an, austrian, army, under, prince, charles, of, lorraine, invaded, alsace, in, early, june, louis, went, on, the, defensive, in, the, southern, netherlands, and, travelled, to, metz, to, meet, this, threat, in, early, august, he, fell, dangerously, ill, with, smallpox, a, disease, often, fatal, at, the, time, although, he, later, recovered, this, temporarily, paralysed, the, french, command, system, with, the, bulk, of, the, austrian, army, occupied, in, eastern, france, frederick, launched, the, second, silesian, war, on, 15, august, and, by, the, end, of, the, month, all, 80, 000, of, his, troops, were, in, bohemia, although, maria, theresa, s, main, objective, was, to, regain, silesia, the, speed, of, the, prussian, advance, took, the, austrians, by, surprise, on, 23, august, prince, charles, withdrew, from, alsace, to, defend, bohemia, with, little, interference, from, the, french, due, to, louis, illness, by, mid, september, frederick, had, captured, prague, tabor, budweis, and, frauenberg, he, now, advanced, up, the, river, moldau, hoping, to, catch, the, austrians, between, his, forces, and, the, franco, bavarian, army, he, assumed, was, in, pursuit, however, the, bavarians, contented, themselves, with, re, occupying, munich, while, the, french, settled, down, to, besiege, freiburg, im, breisgau, a, town, of, far, less, importance, to, maria, theresa, than, bohemia, frederick, was, left, dangerously, exposed, a, situation, worsened, in, early, october, when, saxony, joined, the, coalition, against, him, as, an, active, belligerent, under, pressure, from, charles, of, lorraine, and, a, combined, austro, saxon, force, under, count, traun, the, prussians, were, forced, to, retreat, by, the, time, they, entered, silesia, in, late, november, frederick, s, army, was, reduced, to, 36, 000, half, of, whom, then, died, of, dysentery, despite, the, surrender, of, freiburg, and, french, advances, in, the, southern, netherlands, austria, seemed, well, positioned, at, the, end, of, 1744, frederick, s, retreat, damaged, his, reputation, and, weakened, his, army, but, the, most, significant, impact, was, on, franco, prussian, relations, with, louis, accused, of, failing, to, support, prussia, in, italy, an, austrian, attack, on, the, kingdom, of, naples, was, unsuccessful, largely, due, to, the, incompetence, of, their, commanders, in, the, north, arguments, over, strategy, and, spanish, accusations, of, french, cowardice, at, toulon, prevented, them, from, taking, full, advantage, of, their, victories, earlier, in, the, year, this, was, offset, by, similar, divisions, among, their, opponents, charles, emmanuel, was, reluctant, to, see, the, bourbons, expelled, from, italy, leaving, the, habsburgs, as, the, dominant, power, while, his, territorial, ambitions, could, only, be, achieved, at, austrian, expense, as, a, result, neither, side, could, make, significant, progress, in, this, area, frederick, s, position, continued, to, deteriorate, on, 8, january, austria, britain, the, dutch, republic, and, saxony, signed, the, treaty, of, warsaw, which, was, clearly, aimed, at, prussia, this, was, accompanied, by, ominous, signs, of, russian, military, activity, in, livonia, followed, by, the, death, of, emperor, charles, vii, on, 20, january, since, maria, theresa, s, husband, grand, duke, francis, was, the, best, supported, candidate, to, replace, him, this, was, a, major, setback, for, the, franco, prussian, alliance, charles, son, and, heir, maximilian, iii, joseph, made, one, last, effort, to, drive, the, austrians, out, of, bavaria, but, his, demoralised, and, ill, equipped, army, was, out, manoeuvered, by, count, batthy, ny, while, a, franco, bavarian, army, was, defeated, at, pfaffenhofen, on, 15, april, with, most, of, his, electorate, once, again, occupied, on, 22, april, he, signed, the, treaty, of, f, ssen, in, which, he, agreed, to, vote, for, francis, stephen, as, emperor, and, made, peace, with, austria, prussia, was, now, isolated, attempts, by, frederick, to, divide, his, opponents, by, supporting, frederick, augustus, of, saxony, for, emperor, were, unsuccessful, while, neither, britain, or, russia, was, willing, to, mediate, for, him, with, austria, bavaria, s, exit, allowed, france, to, focus, on, the, low, countries, which, saxe, persuaded, louis, xv, provided, the, best, opportunity, of, defeating, britain, whose, financial, backing, was, crucial, to, the, pragmatic, alliance, he, proposed, to, attack, tournai, a, vital, link, in, the, trading, network, for, northern, europe, and, strongest, of, the, dutch, barrier, forts, this, forcing, the, allies, to, fight, on, ground, of, his, own, choosing, on, 11, may, he, won, a, hard, fought, victory, at, fontenoy, a, success, that, established, french, dominance, in, the, netherlands, and, caused, bitter, disputes, between, the, british, and, dutch, on, 4, june, frederick, won, a, major, victory, at, hohenfriedberg, but, despite, this, austria, and, saxony, continued, the, war, prussian, requests, for, french, support, were, ignored, louis, had, been, warned, by, his, ministers, state, finances, were, increasingly, strained, making, it, important, to, focus, their, efforts, one, area, was, the, netherlands, particularly, after, british, troops, were, recalled, to, deal, with, the, jacobite, rising, of, 1745, the, other, was, italy, where, a, franco, spanish, army, under, maillebois, and, infante, philip, defeated, the, sardinians, at, bassignano, on, 27, september, then, captured, alessandria, valenza, and, casale, monferrato, as, a, result, france, made, no, effort, to, block, the, election, of, duke, francis, who, was, proclaimed, emperor, francis, i, on, 13, september, bolstered, by, this, significant, political, victory, maria, theresa, continued, her, attempts, to, regain, silesia, only, to, be, defeated, once, again, at, the, battle, of, soor, on, 30, september, on, 15, december, the, prussians, forced, saxony, out, of, the, war, with, victory, in, the, battle, of, kesselsdorf, leading, to, the, treaty, of, dresden, on, 25th, austria, accepted, frederick, s, ownership, of, silesia, while, saxony, paid, him, an, indemnity, of, one, million, crowns, in, return, prussia, accepted, the, pragmatic, sanction, acknowledged, francis, as, emperor, and, evacuated, saxony, after, 1745, germany, ceased, to, be, an, active, military, theatre, although, frederick, knew, maria, theresa, still, intended, to, regain, silesia, both, sides, needed, a, period, of, peace, in, order, to, re, organise, french, objectives, were, less, clear, for, centuries, the, central, plank, of, its, foreign, policy, was, weakening, the, habsburgs, but, it, began, the, war, due, to, concern, at, british, commercial, growth, post, 1713, since, the, war, in, northern, italy, was, largely, fought, to, support, spanish, aims, this, left, the, netherlands, as, the, only, remaining, theatre, where, france, could, achieve, strategic, victory, another, significant, development, was, the, start, of, the, realignment, of, alliances, that, became, the, diplomatic, revolution, in, 1756, under, the, august, convention, of, hanover, frederick, and, george, ii, mutually, guaranteed, the, borders, of, hanover, and, prussia, to, each, other, and, british, diplomats, tried, to, persuade, austria, to, end, the, second, silesian, war, franco, prussian, relationships, were, marked, by, mutual, distrust, while, maria, theresa, resented, british, attempts, to, persuade, her, to, accept, the, loss, of, silesia, in, central, italy, an, army, of, spaniards, and, neapolitans, was, collected, for, the, purpose, of, conquering, the, duchy, of, milan, in, 1741, the, allied, army, of, 40, 000, spaniards, and, neapolitans, under, the, command, of, the, duke, of, montemar, had, advanced, towards, modena, francesco, iii, d, este, duke, of, modena, had, allied, himself, with, them, but, the, vigilant, austrian, commander, count, otto, ferdinand, von, traun, had, out, marched, them, captured, modena, and, forced, the, duke, to, make, a, separate, peace, the, aggressiveness, of, the, spanish, in, italy, forced, empress, maria, theresa, of, austria, and, king, charles, emmanuel, of, sardinia, into, negotiations, in, early, 1742, these, negotiations, were, held, at, turin, maria, theresa, sent, her, envoy, count, schulenburg, and, king, charles, emmanuel, sent, the, marquis, d, ormea, on, 1, february, 1742, schulenburg, and, ormea, signed, the, convention, of, turin, which, resolved, or, postponed, resolution, many, differences, and, formed, an, alliance, between, the, two, countries, in, 1742, field, marshal, count, traun, held, his, own, with, ease, against, the, spanish, and, neapolitans, on, 19, august, 1742, naples, was, forced, by, the, arrival, of, a, british, naval, squadron, in, naples, own, harbour, to, withdraw, her, 10, 000, troops, from, the, montemar, force, to, provide, for, home, defence, the, spanish, force, under, montemar, was, now, too, weak, to, advance, in, the, po, valley, and, a, second, spanish, army, was, sent, to, italy, via, france, sardinia, had, allied, herself, with, austria, in, the, convention, of, turin, and, at, the, same, time, neither, state, was, at, war, with, france, and, this, led, to, curious, complications, combats, being, fought, in, the, is, re, valley, between, the, troops, of, sardinia, and, of, spain, in, which, the, french, took, no, part, at, the, end, of, 1742, the, duke, of, montemar, was, replaced, as, head, of, the, spanish, forces, in, italy, by, count, gages, in, 1743, the, spanish, on, the, panaro, had, achieved, a, victory, over, traun, at, campo, santo, on, 8, february, 1743, however, the, next, six, months, were, wasted, in, inaction, and, johann, georg, christian, prince, of, lobkowicz, joining, traun, with, reinforcements, from, austria, drove, back, the, spanish, to, rimini, observing, from, venice, rousseau, hailed, the, spanish, retreat, as, the, finest, military, manoeuvre, of, the, whole, century, the, spanish, savoyard, war, in, the, alps, continued, without, much, result, the, only, incident, of, note, being, the, first, battle, of, casteldelfino, 7, 10, october, 1743, when, an, initial, french, offensive, was, defeated, in, 1744, the, italian, war, became, serious, prior, to, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, 1701, 1714, spain, and, austria, had, been, ruled, by, branches, of, the, same, habsburg, royal, house, consequently, the, foreign, policies, of, austria, and, spain, in, regards, to, italy, had, a, symmetry, of, interests, and, these, interests, were, usually, opposed, to, the, interests, of, bourbon, controlled, france, however, since, the, treaty, of, utrecht, and, the, end, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, the, childless, last, habsburg, monarch, charles, ii, had, been, replaced, by, the, bourbon, grandson, of, the, french, king, louis, xiv, philip, of, anjou, who, became, philip, v, in, spain, spain, s, dominance, of, italy, and, italian, territories, subsequently, passed, to, austria, now, the, symmetry, of, foreign, policy, interests, in, regards, to, italy, existed, between, bourbon, france, and, bourbon, spain, with, habsburg, austria, usually, in, opposition, king, charles, emmanuel, iii, of, sardinia, had, followed, the, long, established, foreign, policy, of, savoy, of, opposing, spanish, interference, in, northern, italy, now, in, 1744, savoy, was, faced, with, a, grandiose, military, plan, of, the, combined, spanish, and, french, armies, called, the, gallispan, army, for, conquest, of, northern, italy, however, in, implementing, this, plan, the, gallispan, generals, at, the, front, were, hampered, by, the, orders, of, their, respective, governments, for, example, the, commander, of, the, french, army, in, the, field, the, prince, of, conti, could, not, get, along, with, or, even, reason, with, the, marquis, de, la, mina, the, supreme, commander, of, all, spanish, forces, the, prince, of, conti, felt, that, the, marquis, deferred, blindly, to, all, orders, coming, from, spain, without, any, consideration, of, the, realities, on, the, ground, in, preparation, for, the, military, campaign, the, gallispan, forces, sought, to, cross, the, alps, in, june, 1744, and, regroup, the, army, in, dauphin, uniting, there, with, the, army, on, the, lower, po, the, support, of, genoa, allowed, a, road, into, central, italy, while, the, prince, of, conti, stayed, in, the, north, count, gages, followed, this, road, to, the, south, but, then, the, austrian, commander, prince, lobkowitz, took, the, offensive, and, drove, the, spanish, army, of, the, count, de, gages, further, southward, towards, the, neapolitan, frontier, near, the, small, town, of, velletri, from, june, through, august, 1744, velletri, became, the, scene, of, extensive, military, maneuvering, between, the, french, spanish, army, under, the, command, of, the, count, gages, and, the, austrian, forces, under, the, command, of, prince, lobkowitz, the, king, of, naples, the, future, charles, iii, of, spain, was, increasingly, worried, about, the, austrian, army, operating, so, close, to, his, borders, and, decided, to, assist, the, spaniards, together, a, combined, army, of, french, spanish, and, neapolitans, surprised, the, austrian, army, on, the, night, of, 16, 17, june, 1744, the, austrians, were, routed, from, three, important, hills, around, the, town, of, velletri, during, the, attack, this, battle, is, sometimes, called, the, battle, of, nemi, after, the, small, town, of, nemi, located, nearby, because, of, this, surprise, attack, the, combined, army, was, able, to, take, possession, of, the, town, of, velletri, thus, the, surprise, attack, has, also, been, called, the, first, battle, of, velletri, in, early, august, 1744, the, king, of, naples, paid, a, visit, in, person, to, the, newly, captured, town, of, velletri, hearing, about, the, presence, of, the, king, the, austrians, developed, a, plan, for, a, daring, raid, on, velletri, during, the, predawn, hours, of, 11, august, 1744, about, 6, 000, austrians, under, the, direct, command, of, count, browne, staged, a, surprise, raid, on, the, town, of, velletri, they, were, attempting, to, abduct, the, king, of, naples, during, his, stay, in, the, town, however, after, occupying, velletri, and, searching, the, entire, town, the, austrians, found, no, hint, of, the, king, of, naples, the, king, had, become, aware, of, what, was, happening, and, had, fled, through, a, window, of, the, palace, where, he, was, staying, and, rode, off, half, dressed, on, horseback, out, of, the, town, this, was, the, second, battle, of, velletri, the, failure, of, the, raid, on, velletri, meant, that, the, austrian, march, toward, naples, was, over, the, defeated, austrians, were, ordered, north, where, they, could, be, used, in, the, piedmont, of, northern, italy, to, assist, the, king, of, sardinia, against, the, prince, of, conti, count, de, gages, followed, the, austrians, north, with, a, weak, force, meanwhile, the, king, of, naples, returned, home, the, war, in, the, alps, and, the, apennines, had, already, been, keenly, contested, before, the, prince, of, conti, and, the, gallispan, army, had, come, down, out, of, the, alps, first, the, fort, de, villefranche, and, fort, du, mont, alban, near, nice, had, been, stormed, by, conti, on, 20, april, 1744, after, coming, down, out, of, the, alps, prince, conti, began, his, advance, into, piedmont, on, 5, july, 1744, on, 19, july, 1744, the, gallispan, army, engaged, the, sardinian, army, in, some, desperate, fighting, at, peyre, longue, on, 18, july, 1744, as, a, result, of, the, battle, the, gallispan, army, took, control, of, casteldelfino, in, the, second, battle, of, casteldelfino, conti, then, moved, on, to, demonte, where, on, the, night, of, 8, 9, august, 1744, a, mere, 36, hours, before, the, spanish, army, in, south, of, italy, fought, the, second, battle, of, velletri, the, gallispan, army, took, the, fortress, of, demonte, from, the, sardinians, in, the, battle, of, demonte, the, king, of, sardinia, was, defeated, yet, again, by, conti, in, a, great, battle, at, madonna, dell, olmo, on, 30, september, 1744, near, coni, cuneo, conti, did, not, however, succeed, in, taking, the, huge, fortress, at, coni, and, had, to, retire, into, dauphin, for, his, winter, quarters, thus, the, gallispan, army, never, did, combine, with, the, spanish, army, under, count, of, gages, in, the, south, and, now, the, austro, sardinian, army, lay, between, them, the, campaign, in, italy, in, 1745, was, also, no, mere, war, of, posts, the, convention, of, turin, of, february, 1742, described, above, which, established, a, provisional, relationship, between, austria, and, sardinia, had, caused, some, consternation, in, the, republic, of, genoa, however, when, this, provisional, relationship, was, given, a, more, durable, and, reliable, character, in, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, worms, 1743, signed, on, 13, september, 1743, the, government, of, genoa, became, fearful, this, fear, of, diplomatic, isolation, had, caused, the, genoese, republic, to, abandon, its, neutrality, in, the, war, and, join, the, bourbon, cause, consequently, the, genoese, republic, signed, a, secret, treaty, with, the, bourbon, allies, of, france, spain, and, naples, on, 26, june, 1745, genoa, declared, war, on, sardinia, empress, maria, theresa, was, frustrated, with, the, failure, of, lobkowitz, to, stop, the, advance, of, gages, accordingly, lobkowitz, was, replaced, with, count, schulenburg, a, change, in, the, command, of, the, austrians, encouraged, the, bourbon, allies, to, strike, first, in, the, spring, of, 1745, accordingly, count, de, gages, moved, from, modena, towards, lucca, the, gallispan, army, in, the, alps, under, the, new, command, of, marshal, maillebois, prince, conti, and, marshal, maillebois, had, exchanged, commands, over, the, winter, of, 1744, 1745, advanced, through, the, italian, riviera, to, the, tanaro, in, the, middle, of, july, 1745, the, two, armies, were, at, last, concentrated, between, the, scrivia, and, the, tanaro, together, count, de, gages, s, army, and, the, gallispan, army, composed, an, unusually, large, number, of, 80, 000, men, a, swift, march, on, piacenza, drew, the, austrian, commander, thither, and, in, his, absence, the, allies, fell, upon, and, completely, defeated, the, sardinians, at, bassignano, on, 27, september, 1745, a, victory, which, was, quickly, followed, by, the, capture, of, alessandria, valenza, and, casale, monferrato, jomini, calls, the, concentration, of, forces, which, effected, the, victory, le, plus, remarquable, de, toute, la, guerre, the, complicated, politics, of, italy, however, are, reflected, in, the, fact, that, count, maillebois, was, ultimately, unable, to, turn, his, victory, to, account, indeed, early, in, 1746, austrian, troops, freed, by, the, austrian, peace, with, frederick, ii, of, prussia, passed, through, the, tyrol, into, italy, capturing, genoa, after, a, siege, the, gallispan, winter, quarters, at, asti, italy, were, brusquely, attacked, and, a, french, garrison, of, 6, 000, men, at, asti, was, forced, to, capitulate, at, the, same, time, maximilian, ulysses, browne, with, an, austrian, corps, struck, at, the, allies, on, the, lower, po, and, cut, off, their, communication, with, the, main, body, of, the, gallispan, army, in, piedmont, a, series, of, minor, actions, thus, completely, destroyed, the, great, concentration, of, gallispan, troops, and, the, austrians, reconquered, the, duchy, of, milan, and, took, possession, of, much, of, northern, italy, the, allies, separated, maillebois, covering, liguria, the, spaniards, marching, against, browne, the, latter, was, promptly, and, heavily, reinforced, and, all, that, the, spaniards, could, do, was, to, entrench, themselves, at, piacenza, philip, the, spanish, infante, as, supreme, commander, calling, up, maillebois, to, his, aid, the, french, skilfully, conducted, and, marching, rapidly, joined, forces, once, more, but, their, situation, was, critical, for, only, two, marches, behind, them, the, army, of, the, king, of, sardinia, was, in, pursuit, and, before, them, lay, the, principal, army, of, the, austrians, the, pitched, battle, of, piacenza, on, 16, june, 1746, was, hard, fought, but, ended, in, an, austrian, victory, with, the, spanish, army, heavily, mauled, that, the, army, escaped, at, all, was, in, the, highest, degree, creditable, to, maillebois, and, to, his, son, and, chief, of, staff, under, their, leadership, the, gallispan, army, eluded, both, the, austrians, and, the, sardinians, and, defeated, an, austrian, corps, in, the, battle, of, rottofreddo, on, 12, august, 1746, then, the, austrian, army, made, good, its, retreat, back, to, genoa, although, the, austrian, army, was, a, mere, shadow, of, its, former, self, when, they, returned, to, genoa, the, austrians, were, soon, in, control, of, northern, italy, the, austrians, occupied, the, republic, of, genoa, on, 6, september, 1746, but, they, met, with, no, success, in, their, forays, towards, the, alps, soon, genoa, revolted, and, drove, out, the, austrians, on, 5, 11, december, 1746, as, an, allied, invasion, of, provence, stalled, and, the, french, now, commanded, by, charles, louis, auguste, fouquet, duc, de, belle, isle, took, the, offensive, 1747, genoa, held, out, against, a, second, austrian, siege, as, usual, the, plan, of, campaign, had, been, referred, to, paris, and, madrid, a, picked, corps, of, the, french, army, under, the, chevalier, de, belle, isle, the, younger, brother, of, marshal, belle, isle, was, ordered, to, storm, the, fortified, pass, of, exilles, on, 10, july, 1747, however, the, defending, army, of, the, worms, allies, austria, and, savoy, handed, the, french, army, a, crushing, defeat, at, this, battle, which, became, known, as, the, colle, dell, assietta, at, this, battle, the, chevalier, and, with, him, much, of, the, elite, of, the, french, nobility, were, killed, on, the, barricades, desultory, campaigns, continued, between, the, worms, allies, and, the, french, until, the, conclusion, of, peace, at, aix, la, chapelle, the, dutch, british, and, austrians, withdrew, from, fontenoy, in, good, order, but, tournai, fell, to, french, forces, and, through, a, swift, advance, ghent, oudenarde, bruges, and, dendermonde, soon, followed, by, the, end, of, july, the, french, stood, on, the, threshold, of, dutch, flanders, the, south, western, corner, of, the, dutch, republic, the, french, backed, jacobite, rising, of, august, 1745, forced, the, british, to, transfer, troops, from, flanders, to, deal, with, it, this, prompted, the, french, to, seize, the, strategic, ports, of, ostend, and, nieuwpoort, threatening, britain, s, links, to, mainland, europe, during, 1746, the, french, continued, their, advance, into, the, austrian, netherlands, taking, antwerp, and, then, clearing, dutch, and, austrian, forces, from, the, area, between, brussels, and, the, meuse, after, defeating, the, jacobite, rebellion, at, culloden, in, april, the, british, launched, a, diversionary, raid, on, lorient, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, divert, french, forces, while, the, new, austrian, commander, prince, charles, of, lorraine, was, defeated, by, saxe, at, the, battle, of, rocoux, in, october, the, dutch, republic, itself, was, now, in, danger, in, april, 1747, the, french, began, reducing, the, barrier, fortresses, along, the, border, with, the, austrian, netherlands, and, invaded, dutch, flanders, which, they, swiftly, captured, a, general, anger, and, panic, broke, out, under, the, dutch, population, who, still, remembered, the, french, invasion, of, 1672, and, they, demanded, that, william, iv, should, be, appointed, stadtholder, the, regents, of, zeeland, and, holland, fearing, violence, against, them, soon, appointed, william, stadtholder, the, remaining, provinces, followed, and, by, 10, may, the, second, stadtholderless, period, had, ended, william, was, also, appointed, head, of, all, the, dutch, armed, forces, the, strategic, situation, however, failed, to, change, and, at, lauffeld, on, 2, july, 1747, saxe, won, another, victory, over, a, british, and, dutch, army, under, the, prince, of, waldeck, and, cumberland, the, french, then, besieged, maastricht, and, bergen, op, zoom, which, fell, in, september, although, the, dutch, states, navy, was, in, the, poorest, condition, it, had, ever, been, in, its, positioning, in, the, estuaries, and, rivers, of, zeeland, and, holland, however, prevented, french, incursions, into, those, provinces, the, french, advance, lent, greater, urgency, to, ongoing, peace, talks, at, the, congress, of, breda, which, took, place, to, the, sound, of, french, artillery, firing, on, maastricht, following, their, 1746, alliance, with, austria, an, army, of, 30, 000, russians, marched, from, livonia, to, the, rhine, but, arrived, too, late, to, be, of, use, maastricht, surrendered, on, 7, may, and, on, 18, october, 1748, the, war, ended, with, the, signing, of, the, peace, of, aix, la, chapelle, negotiations, between, britain, and, france, had, been, taking, place, at, breda, since, june, 1746, the, terms, they, agreed, were, then, imposed, on, the, other, parties, at, aix, la, chapelle, despite, their, victories, in, flanders, french, finance, minister, machault, repeatedly, warned, of, the, impending, collapse, of, their, financial, system, the, british, naval, blockade, led, to, the, collapse, of, french, customs, receipts, and, caused, severe, food, shortages, especially, among, the, poor, after, cape, finisterre, in, october, the, french, navy, could, no, longer, protect, their, colonies, or, trade, routes, this, was, followed, in, november, by, a, convention, between, britain, and, russia, in, february, 1748, a, russian, corps, of, 37, 000, arrived, in, the, rhineland, although, the, dutch, city, of, maastricht, surrendered, to, french, forces, in, may, 1748, ending, the, war, was, increasingly, urgent, louis, xv, therefore, agreed, to, return, the, austrian, netherlands, whose, acquisition, had, cost, so, much, few, of, his, countrymen, understood, this, decision, combined, with, the, lack, of, tangible, benefits, for, helping, prussia, it, led, to, the, phrase, as, stupid, as, the, peace, a, commission, to, negotiate, competing, territorial, claims, in, north, america, was, set, up, but, made, very, little, progress, britain, regained, madras, in, return, for, restoring, louisbourg, in, nova, scotia, much, to, the, fury, of, british, colonists, neither, of, the, two, main, protagonists, appeared, to, have, gained, much, for, their, investment, and, both, viewed, the, treaty, as, an, armistice, not, a, peace, in, austria, reactions, were, mixed, maria, theresa, was, determined, to, regain, silesia, and, resented, british, support, for, prussia, s, occupation, on, the, other, hand, the, treaty, confirmed, her, right, to, the, monarchy, while, the, habsburgs, had, survived, a, potentially, disastrous, crisis, regained, the, austrian, netherlands, without, fighting, and, made, only, minor, concessions, in, italy, administrative, and, financial, reforms, made, it, stronger, in, 1750, than, 1740, while, its, strategic, position, was, strengthened, through, installing, habsburg, allies, as, rulers, of, key, territories, in, northwest, germany, the, rhineland, and, northern, italy, of, the, other, combatants, spain, retained, its, predominance, in, spanish, america, and, made, minor, gains, in, northern, italy, gaining, the, duchy, of, parma, and, piacenza, for, infante, philip, with, french, support, prussia, doubled, in, size, with, the, acquisition, of, silesia, but, twice, made, peace, without, informing, their, ally, louis, xv, already, disliked, frederick, and, now, viewed, him, as, untrustworthy, in, the, dutch, republic, the, signing, of, the, peace, terms, the, elevation, of, the, prince, of, orange, and, the, birth, of, his, son, caused, great, joy, but, dissatisfaction, towards, the, ruling, regime, remained, william, iv, had, changed, little, did, not, reckon, with, his, political, opponents, and, like, them, was, accused, of, french, sympathies, many, began, to, think, that, improvements, would, not, be, obtained, unless, they, were, violently, demanded, and, so, riots, arose, the, war, confirmed, the, decline, of, the, dutch, republic, and, the, dismantlement, of, the, barrier, fortresses, marked, the, end, of, its, period, as, a, great, power, combined, with, a, sense, they, received, little, value, for, the, subsidies, paid, to, maria, theresa, britain, moved, to, align, itself, with, prussia, rather, than, austria, in, order, to, protect, hanover, from, french, aggression, these, factors, led, to, the, realignment, known, as, the, 1756, diplomatic, revolution, and, the, 1756, to, 1763, seven, years, war, which, was, even, grander, in, scale, than, its, predecessor, the, war, was, also, conducted, in, north, america, and, india, in, north, america, the, conflict, was, known, in, the, british, colonies, as, king, george, s, war, and, did, not, begin, until, after, formal, war, declarations, of, france, and, britain, reached, the, colonies, in, may, 1744, the, frontiers, between, new, france, and, the, british, colonies, of, new, england, new, york, and, nova, scotia, were, the, site, of, frequent, small, scale, raids, primarily, by, french, colonial, troops, and, their, indian, allies, against, british, targets, although, several, attempts, were, made, by, british, colonists, to, organise, expeditions, against, new, france, the, most, significant, incident, was, the, capture, of, the, french, fortress, of, louisbourg, on, cape, breton, island, le, royale, by, an, expedition, 29, april, 16, june, 1745, of, colonial, militia, organised, by, massachusetts, governor, william, shirley, commanded, by, william, pepperrell, of, maine, then, part, of, massachusetts, and, assisted, by, a, royal, navy, fleet, a, french, expedition, to, recover, louisbourg, in, 1746, failed, due, to, bad, weather, disease, and, the, death, of, its, commander, louisbourg, was, returned, to, france, in, exchange, for, madras, generating, much, anger, among, the, british, colonists, who, felt, they, had, eliminated, a, nest, of, privateers, with, its, capture, the, war, marked, the, beginning, of, a, powerful, struggle, between, britain, and, france, in, india, and, of, european, military, ascendancy, and, political, intervention, in, the, subcontinent, major, hostilities, began, with, the, arrival, of, a, naval, squadron, under, mah, de, la, bourdonnais, carrying, troops, from, france, in, september, 1746, bourdonnais, landed, his, troops, near, madras, and, laid, siege, to, the, port, although, it, was, the, main, british, settlement, in, the, carnatic, madras, was, weakly, fortified, and, had, only, a, small, garrison, reflecting, the, thoroughly, commercial, nature, of, the, european, presence, in, india, hitherto, on, 10, september, only, six, days, after, the, arrival, of, the, french, force, madras, surrendered, the, terms, of, the, surrender, agreed, by, bourdonnais, provided, for, the, settlement, to, be, ransomed, back, for, a, cash, payment, by, the, british, east, india, company, however, this, concession, was, opposed, by, dupleix, the, governor, general, of, the, indian, possessions, of, the, compagnie, des, indes, when, bourdonnais, was, forced, to, leave, india, in, october, after, the, devastation, of, his, squadron, by, a, cyclone, dupleix, reneged, on, the, agreement, the, nawab, of, the, carnatic, anwaruddin, muhammed, khan, intervened, in, support, of, the, british, and, advanced, to, retake, madras, but, despite, vast, superiority, in, numbers, his, army, was, easily, and, bloodily, crushed, by, the, french, in, the, first, demonstration, of, the, gap, in, quality, that, had, opened, up, between, european, and, indian, armies, the, french, now, turned, to, the, remaining, british, settlement, in, the, carnatic, fort, st, david, at, cuddalore, which, was, dangerously, close, to, the, main, french, settlement, of, pondich, ry, the, first, french, force, sent, against, cuddalore, was, surprised, and, defeated, nearby, by, the, forces, of, the, nawab, and, the, british, garrison, in, december, 1746, early, in, 1747, a, second, expedition, laid, siege, to, fort, st, david, but, withdrew, on, the, arrival, of, a, british, naval, squadron, in, march, a, final, attempt, in, june, 1748, avoided, the, fort, and, attacked, the, weakly, fortified, town, of, cuddalore, itself, but, was, routed, by, the, british, garrison, with, the, arrival, of, a, naval, squadron, under, admiral, edward, boscawen, carrying, troops, and, artillery, the, british, went, on, the, offensive, laying, siege, to, pondich, ry, they, enjoyed, a, considerable, superiority, in, numbers, over, the, defenders, but, the, settlement, had, been, heavily, fortified, by, dupleix, and, after, two, months, the, siege, was, abandoned, the, peace, settlement, brought, the, return, of, madras, to, the, british, company, exchanged, for, louisbourg, in, canada, however, the, conflict, between, the, two, companies, continued, by, proxy, during, the, interval, before, the, outbreak, of, the, seven, years, war, with, british, and, french, forces, fighting, on, behalf, of, rival, claimants, to, the, thrones, of, hyderabad, and, the, carnatic, the, naval, operations, of, this, war, were, entangled, with, the, war, of, jenkins, ear, which, broke, out, in, 1739, in, consequence, of, the, long, disputes, between, britain, and, spain, over, their, conflicting, claims, in, america, the, war, was, remarkable, for, the, prominence, of, privateering, on, both, sides, it, was, carried, on, by, the, spaniards, in, the, west, indies, with, great, success, and, actively, at, home, the, french, were, no, less, active, in, all, seas, mah, de, la, bourdonnais, s, attack, on, madras, partook, largely, of, the, nature, of, a, privateering, venture, the, british, retaliated, with, vigour, the, total, number, of, captures, by, french, and, spanish, corsairs, was, in, all, probability, larger, than, the, list, of, british, as, the, french, wit, voltaire, drolly, put, it, upon, hearing, his, government, s, boast, namely, that, more, british, merchants, were, taken, because, there, were, many, more, british, merchant, ships, to, take, but, partly, also, because, the, british, government, had, not, yet, begun, to, enforce, the, use, of, convoy, so, strictly, as, it, did, in, later, times, war, on, spain, was, declared, by, great, britain, on, 23, october, 1739, which, has, become, known, as, the, war, of, jenkins, ear, a, plan, was, laid, for, combined, operations, against, the, spanish, colonies, from, east, and, west, one, force, military, and, naval, was, to, assault, them, from, the, west, indies, under, admiral, edward, vernon, another, to, be, commanded, by, commodore, george, anson, afterwards, lord, anson, was, to, round, cape, horn, and, to, fall, upon, the, pacific, coast, of, latin, america, delays, bad, preparations, dockyard, corruption, and, the, squabbles, of, the, naval, and, military, officers, concerned, caused, the, failure, of, a, hopeful, scheme, on, 21, november, 1739, admiral, vernon, did, however, succeed, in, capturing, the, ill, defended, spanish, harbour, of, porto, bello, in, present, day, panama, when, vernon, had, been, joined, by, sir, chaloner, ogle, with, massive, naval, reinforcements, and, a, strong, body, of, troops, an, attack, was, made, on, cartagena, de, indias, in, what, is, now, colombia, 9, march, 24, april, 1741, the, delay, had, given, the, spanish, under, sebasti, n, de, eslava, and, blas, de, lezo, time, to, prepare, after, two, months, of, skilful, defence, by, the, spanish, the, british, attack, finally, succumbed, to, a, massive, outbreak, of, disease, and, withdrew, having, suffered, a, dreadful, loss, of, lives, and, ships, the, war, in, the, west, indies, after, two, other, unsuccessful, attacks, had, been, made, on, spanish, territory, died, down, and, did, not, revive, until, 1748, the, expedition, under, anson, sailed, late, was, very, ill, provided, and, less, strong, than, had, been, intended, it, consisted, of, six, ships, and, left, britain, on, 18, september, 1740, anson, returned, alone, with, his, flagship, the, centurion, on, 15, june, 1744, the, other, vessels, had, either, failed, to, round, the, horn, or, had, been, lost, but, anson, had, harried, the, coast, of, chile, and, peru, and, had, captured, a, spanish, galleon, of, immense, value, near, the, philippines, completing, a, circumnavigation, of, the, world, his, cruise, was, a, great, feat, of, resolution, and, endurance, after, the, failure, of, the, british, invasions, and, a, spanish, counter, invasion, of, georgia, in, 1742, belligerent, naval, actions, in, the, caribbean, were, left, to, the, privateers, of, both, sides, fearing, great, financial, and, economic, losses, should, a, treasure, fleet, be, captured, the, spanish, reduced, the, risk, by, increasing, the, number, of, convoys, thereby, reducing, their, value, they, also, increased, the, number, of, ports, they, visited, and, reduced, the, predictability, of, their, voyages, in, 1744, a, british, force, of, 300, men, accompanied, by, two, privateers, from, saint, kitts, successfully, captured, the, french, half, of, neighbouring, saint, martin, occupying, it, until, the, 1748, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, in, late, may, 1745, two, french, royal, frigates, of, 36, and, 30, guns, respectively, under, commodore, la, touch, plus, three, privateers, in, retaliation, sailed, from, martinique, to, invade, and, capture, the, british, colony, of, anguilla, but, were, repelled, with, heavy, loss, in, the, battle, of, anguilla, the, last, year, of, the, war, saw, two, significant, actions, in, the, caribbean, a, second, british, assault, on, santiago, de, cuba, which, also, ended, in, failure, and, a, naval, action, which, arose, from, an, accidental, encounter, between, two, convoys, the, action, unfolded, in, a, confused, way, with, each, side, at, once, anxious, to, cover, its, own, trade, and, to, intercept, that, of, the, other, capture, was, rendered, particularly, desirable, for, the, british, by, the, fact, that, the, spanish, homeward, bound, fleet, would, be, laden, with, bullion, from, the, american, mines, the, advantage, lay, with, the, british, when, one, spanish, warship, ran, aground, and, another, was, captured, but, the, british, commander, failed, to, capitalise, and, the, spanish, fleet, took, shelter, in, havana, while, anson, was, pursuing, his, voyage, round, the, world, spain, was, mainly, intent, on, the, italian, policy, of, the, king, a, squadron, was, fitted, out, at, c, diz, to, convey, troops, to, italy, it, was, watched, by, the, british, admiral, nicholas, haddock, when, the, blockading, squadron, was, forced, off, by, want, of, provisions, the, spanish, admiral, don, juan, jos, navarro, put, to, sea, he, was, followed, but, when, the, british, force, came, in, sight, of, him, navarro, had, been, joined, by, a, french, squadron, under, claude, lis, e, de, court, de, la, bruy, re, december, 1741, the, french, admiral, told, haddock, that, he, would, support, the, spaniards, if, they, were, attacked, and, haddock, retired, france, and, great, britain, were, not, yet, openly, at, war, but, both, were, engaged, in, the, struggle, in, germany, great, britain, as, the, ally, of, the, queen, of, hungary, maria, theresa, france, as, the, supporter, of, the, bavarian, claimant, of, the, empire, navarro, and, de, court, went, on, to, toulon, where, they, remained, until, february, 1744, a, british, fleet, watched, them, under, the, command, of, admiral, richard, lestock, until, sir, thomas, mathews, was, sent, out, as, commander, in, chief, and, as, minister, to, the, court, of, turin, sporadic, manifestations, of, hostility, between, the, french, and, british, took, place, in, different, seas, but, avowed, war, did, not, begin, until, the, french, government, issued, its, declaration, of, 30, march, to, which, great, britain, replied, on, 31, march, this, formality, had, been, preceded, by, french, preparations, for, the, invasion, of, england, and, by, the, battle, of, toulon, between, the, british, and, a, franco, spanish, fleet, on, 11, february, a, most, confused, battle, was, fought, in, which, the, van, and, centre, of, the, british, fleet, was, engaged, with, the, spanish, rear, and, centre, of, the, allies, lestock, who, was, on, the, worst, possible, terms, with, his, superior, took, no, part, in, the, action, mathews, fought, with, spirit, but, in, a, disorderly, way, breaking, the, formation, of, his, fleet, and, showing, no, power, of, direction, while, navarro, s, smaller, fleet, retained, cohesion, and, fought, off, the, energetic, but, confused, attacks, of, its, larger, enemy, until, the, arrival, of, the, french, fleet, forced, the, heavily, damaged, british, fleet, to, withdraw, the, spanish, fleet, then, sailed, to, italy, where, it, delivered, a, fresh, army, and, supplies, that, had, a, decisive, impact, upon, the, war, the, mismanagement, of, the, british, fleet, in, the, battle, by, arousing, deep, anger, among, the, people, led, to, a, drastic, reform, of, the, british, navy, the, french, scheme, to, invade, britain, was, arranged, in, combination, with, the, jacobite, leaders, and, soldiers, were, to, be, transported, from, dunkirk, in, february, 1744, a, french, fleet, of, twenty, sail, of, the, line, entered, the, english, channel, under, jacques, aymar, comte, de, roquefeuil, before, the, british, force, under, admiral, john, norris, was, ready, to, oppose, him, but, the, french, force, was, ill, equipped, the, admiral, was, nervous, his, mind, dwelt, on, all, the, misfortunes, which, might, possibly, happen, and, the, weather, was, bad, de, roquefeuil, came, up, almost, as, far, as, the, downs, where, he, learnt, that, sir, john, norris, was, at, hand, with, twenty, five, sail, of, the, line, and, thereupon, precipitately, retreated, the, military, expedition, prepared, at, dunkirk, to, cross, under, cover, of, de, roquefeuil, s, fleet, naturally, did, not, start, the, utter, weakness, of, the, french, at, sea, due, to, long, neglect, of, the, fleet, and, the, bankrupt, state, of, the, treasury, was, shown, during, the, jacobite, rising, of, 1745, when, france, made, no, attempt, to, profit, by, the, distress, of, the, british, government, the, dutch, having, by, this, time, joined, great, britain, made, a, serious, addition, to, the, naval, power, opposed, to, france, though, the, dutch, republic, was, compelled, by, the, necessity, for, maintaining, an, army, in, flanders, to, play, a, very, subordinate, part, at, sea, not, being, stimulated, by, formidable, attack, and, having, immediate, interests, both, at, home, and, in, germany, the, british, government, was, slow, to, make, use, of, its, latest, naval, strength, spain, which, could, do, nothing, of, an, offensive, character, was, almost, neglected, during, 1745, the, new, england, expedition, which, took, louisburg, 30, april, 16, june, was, covered, by, a, british, naval, force, but, little, else, was, accomplished, by, the, naval, efforts, of, any, of, the, belligerents, in, 1746, a, british, combined, naval, and, military, expedition, to, the, coast, of, france, the, first, of, a, long, series, of, similar, ventures, which, in, the, end, were, derided, as, breaking, windows, with, guineas, was, carried, out, during, august, and, october, the, aim, was, the, capture, of, the, french, east, india, company, s, dockyard, at, lorient, but, it, was, not, attained, from, 1747, until, the, close, of, the, war, in, october, 1748, the, naval, policy, of, the, british, government, without, reaching, a, high, level, was, more, energetic, and, coherent, a, closer, watch, was, kept, on, the, french, coast, and, effectual, means, were, taken, to, intercept, communication, between, france, and, her, american, possessions, in, the, spring, information, was, obtained, that, an, important, convoy, for, the, east, and, west, indies, was, to, sail, from, lorient, the, convoy, was, intercepted, by, anson, on, 3, may, and, in, the, first, battle, of, cape, finisterre, british, admiral, george, anson, s, fourteen, ships, of, the, line, wiped, out, the, french, escort, of, six, ships, of, the, line, and, three, armed, indiamen, although, in, the, meantime, the, merchant, ships, escaped, on, 14, october, another, french, convoy, protected, by, a, strong, squadron, was, intercepted, by, a, well, appointed, and, well, directed, squadron, of, superior, numbers, the, squadrons, were, respectively, eight, french, and, fourteen, british, in, the, bay, of, biscay, in, the, second, battle, of, cape, finisterre, which, followed, the, french, admiral, henri, fran, ois, des, herbiers, marquis, de, l, estendu, re, succeeded, in, covering, the, escape, of, most, of, the, merchant, ships, but, hawke, s, british, squadron, took, six, of, his, warships, most, of, the, merchantmen, were, later, intercepted, and, captured, in, the, west, indies, this, disaster, convinced, the, french, government, of, its, helplessness, at, sea, and, it, made, no, further, effort, in, the, east, indies, attacks, on, french, commerce, by, a, british, squadron, under, curtis, barnett, in, 1745, led, to, the, despatch, of, a, french, squadron, commanded, by, mah, de, la, bourdonnais, after, an, inconclusive, clash, off, negapatnam, in, july, 1746, edward, peyton, barnett, s, successor, withdrew, to, bengal, leaving, bourdonnais, unopposed, on, the, coromandel, coast, he, landed, troops, near, madras, and, besieged, the, port, by, land, and, sea, forcing, it, to, surrender, on, 10, september, 1746, in, october, the, french, squadron, was, devastated, by, a, cyclone, losing, four, ships, of, the, line, and, suffering, heavy, damage, to, four, more, and, the, surviving, ships, withdrew, french, land, forces, went, on, to, make, several, attacks, on, the, british, settlement, at, cuddalore, but, the, eventual, replacement, of, the, negligent, peyton, by, thomas, griffin, resulted, in, a, return, to, british, naval, supremacy, which, put, the, french, on, the, defensive, despite, the, appearance, of, another, french, squadron, the, arrival, of, large, scale, british, reinforcements, under, edward, boscawen, who, considered, but, did, not, make, an, attack, on, le, de, france, on, the, way, gave, the, british, overwhelming, dominance, on, land, and, sea, but, the, ensuing, siege, of, pondich, ry, organised, by, boscawen, was, unsuccessful, european, warfare, in, the, early, modern, period, was, characterised, by, the, widespread, adoption, of, firearms, in, combination, with, more, traditional, bladed, weapons, eighteenth, century, european, armies, were, built, around, units, of, massed, infantry, armed, with, smoothbore, flintlock, muskets, and, bayonets, cavalrymen, were, equipped, with, sabres, and, pistols, or, carbines, light, cavalry, were, used, principally, for, reconnaissance, screening, and, tactical, communications, while, heavy, cavalry, were, used, as, tactical, reserves, and, deployed, for, shock, attacks, smoothbore, artillery, provided, fire, support, and, played, the, leading, role, in, siege, warfare, strategic, warfare, in, this, period, centred, around, control, of, key, fortifications, positioned, so, as, to, command, the, surrounding, regions, and, roads, with, lengthy, sieges, a, common, feature, of, armed, conflict, decisive, field, battles, were, relatively, rare, though, they, played, a, larger, part, in, frederick, s, theory, of, warfare, than, was, typical, among, his, contemporary, rivals, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, like, most, european, wars, of, the, eighteenth, century, was, fought, as, a, so, called, cabinet, war, in, which, disciplined, regular, armies, were, equipped, and, supplied, by, the, state, to, conduct, warfare, on, behalf, of, the, sovereign, s, interests, occupied, enemy, territories, were, regularly, taxed, and, extorted, for, funds, but, large, scale, atrocities, against, civilian, populations, were, rare, compared, with, conflicts, in, the, previous, century, military, logistics, was, the, decisive, factor, in, many, wars, as, armies, had, grown, too, large, to, support, themselves, on, prolonged, campaigns, by, foraging, and, plunder, alone, military, supplies, were, stored, in, centralised, magazines, and, distributed, by, baggage, trains, that, were, highly, vulnerable, to, enemy, raids, armies, were, generally, unable, to, sustain, combat, operations, during, winter, and, normally, established, winter, quarters, in, the, cold, season, resuming, their, campaigns, with, the, return, of, spring
