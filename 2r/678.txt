chronology, from, latin, chronologia, from, ancient, greek, chr, nos, time, and, logia, is, the, science, of, arranging, events, in, their, order, of, occurrence, in, time, consider, for, example, the, use, of, a, timeline, or, sequence, of, events, it, is, also, the, determination, of, the, actual, temporal, sequence, of, past, events, chronology, is, a, part, of, periodization, it, is, also, a, part, of, the, discipline, of, history, including, earth, history, the, earth, sciences, and, study, of, the, geologic, time, scale, chronology, is, the, science, of, locating, historical, events, in, time, it, relies, mostly, upon, chronometry, which, is, also, known, as, timekeeping, and, historiography, which, examines, the, writing, of, history, and, the, use, of, historical, methods, radiocarbon, dating, estimates, the, age, of, formerly, living, things, by, measuring, the, proportion, of, carbon, 14, isotope, in, their, carbon, content, dendrochronology, estimates, the, age, of, trees, by, correlation, of, the, various, growth, rings, in, their, wood, to, known, year, by, year, reference, sequences, in, the, region, to, reflect, year, to, year, climatic, variation, dendrochronology, is, used, in, turn, as, a, calibration, reference, for, radiocarbon, dating, curves, the, familiar, terms, calendar, and, era, within, the, meaning, of, a, coherent, system, of, numbered, calendar, years, concern, two, complementary, fundamental, concepts, of, chronology, for, example, during, eight, centuries, the, calendar, belonging, to, the, christian, era, which, era, was, taken, in, use, in, the, 8th, century, by, bede, was, the, julian, calendar, but, after, the, year, 1582, it, was, the, gregorian, calendar, dionysius, exiguus, about, the, year, 500, was, the, founder, of, that, era, which, is, nowadays, the, most, widespread, dating, system, on, earth, an, epoch, is, the, date, year, usually, when, an, era, begins, ab, urbe, condita, is, latin, for, from, the, founding, of, the, city, rome, traditionally, set, in, 753, bc, it, was, used, to, identify, the, roman, year, by, a, few, roman, historians, modern, historians, use, it, much, more, frequently, than, the, romans, themselves, did, the, dominant, method, of, identifying, roman, years, was, to, name, the, two, consuls, who, held, office, that, year, before, the, advent, of, the, modern, critical, edition, of, historical, roman, works, auc, was, indiscriminately, added, to, them, by, earlier, editors, making, it, appear, more, widely, used, than, it, actually, was, it, was, used, systematically, for, the, first, time, only, about, the, year, 400, by, the, iberian, historian, orosius, pope, boniface, iv, in, about, the, year, 600, seems, to, have, been, the, first, who, made, a, connection, between, these, this, era, and, anno, domini, ad, 1, auc, 754, dionysius, exiguus, anno, domini, era, which, contains, only, calendar, years, ad, was, extended, by, bede, to, the, complete, christian, era, which, contains, in, addition, all, calendar, years, bc, but, no, year, zero, ten, centuries, after, bede, the, french, astronomers, philippe, de, la, hire, in, the, year, 1702, and, jacques, cassini, in, the, year, 1740, purely, to, simplify, certain, calculations, put, the, julian, dating, system, proposed, in, the, year, 1583, by, joseph, scaliger, and, with, it, an, astronomical, era, into, use, which, contains, a, leap, year, zero, which, precedes, the, year, 1, ad, while, of, critical, importance, to, the, historian, methods, of, determining, chronology, are, used, in, most, disciplines, of, science, especially, astronomy, geology, paleontology, and, archaeology, in, the, absence, of, written, history, with, its, chronicles, and, king, lists, late, 19th, century, archaeologists, found, that, they, could, develop, relative, chronologies, based, on, pottery, techniques, and, styles, in, the, field, of, egyptology, william, flinders, petrie, pioneered, sequence, dating, to, penetrate, pre, dynastic, neolithic, times, using, groups, of, contemporary, artefacts, deposited, together, at, a, single, time, in, graves, and, working, backwards, methodically, from, the, earliest, historical, phases, of, egypt, this, method, of, dating, is, known, as, seriation, known, wares, discovered, at, strata, in, sometimes, quite, distant, sites, the, product, of, trade, helped, extend, the, network, of, chronologies, some, cultures, have, retained, the, name, applied, to, them, in, reference, to, characteristic, forms, for, lack, of, an, idea, of, what, they, called, themselves, the, beaker, people, in, northern, europe, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, for, example, the, study, of, the, means, of, placing, pottery, and, other, cultural, artifacts, into, some, kind, of, order, proceeds, in, two, phases, classification, and, typology, classification, creates, categories, for, the, purposes, of, description, and, typology, seeks, to, identify, and, analyse, changes, that, allow, artifacts, to, be, placed, into, sequences, laboratory, techniques, developed, particularly, after, mid, 20th, century, helped, constantly, revise, and, refine, the, chronologies, developed, for, specific, cultural, areas, unrelated, dating, methods, help, reinforce, a, chronology, an, axiom, of, corroborative, evidence, ideally, archaeological, materials, used, for, dating, a, site, should, complement, each, other, and, provide, a, means, of, cross, checking, conclusions, drawn, from, just, one, unsupported, technique, are, usually, regarded, as, unreliable, the, fundamental, problem, of, chronology, is, to, synchronize, events, by, synchronizing, an, event, it, becomes, possible, to, relate, it, to, the, current, time, and, to, compare, the, event, to, other, events, among, historians, a, typical, need, is, to, synchronize, the, reigns, of, kings, and, leaders, in, order, to, relate, the, history, of, one, country, or, region, to, that, of, another, for, example, the, chronicon, of, eusebius, 325, a, d, is, one, of, the, major, works, of, historical, synchronism, this, work, has, two, sections, the, first, contains, narrative, chronicles, of, nine, different, kingdoms, chaldean, assyrian, median, lydian, persian, hebrew, greek, peloponnesian, asian, and, roman, the, second, part, is, a, long, table, synchronizing, the, events, from, each, of, the, nine, kingdoms, in, parallel, columns, by, comparing, the, parallel, columns, the, reader, can, determine, which, events, were, contemporaneous, or, how, many, years, separated, two, different, events, to, place, all, the, events, on, the, same, time, scale, eusebius, used, an, anno, mundi, a, m, era, meaning, that, events, were, dated, from, the, supposed, beginning, of, the, world, as, computed, from, the, book, of, genesis, in, the, hebrew, pentateuch, according, to, the, computation, eusebius, used, this, occurred, in, 5199, b, c, the, chronicon, of, eusebius, was, widely, used, in, the, medieval, world, to, establish, the, dates, and, times, of, historical, events, subsequent, chronographers, such, as, george, syncellus, died, circa, 811, analyzed, and, elaborated, on, the, chronicon, by, comparing, with, other, chronologies, the, last, great, chronographer, was, joseph, justus, scaliger, 1540, 1609, who, reconstructed, the, lost, chronicon, and, synchronized, all, of, ancient, history, in, his, two, major, works, de, emendatione, temporum, 1583, and, thesaurus, temporum, 1606, much, of, modern, historical, datings, and, chronology, of, the, ancient, world, ultimately, derives, from, these, two, works, scaliger, invented, the, concept, of, the, julian, day, which, is, still, used, as, the, standard, unified, scale, of, time, for, both, historians, and, astronomers, in, addition, to, the, literary, methods, of, synchronism, used, by, traditional, chronographers, such, as, eusebius, syncellus, and, scaliger, it, is, possible, to, synchronize, events, by, archaeological, or, astronomical, means, for, example, the, eclipse, of, thales, described, in, the, first, book, of, herodotus, can, potentially, be, used, to, date, the, lydian, war, because, the, eclipse, took, place, during, the, middle, of, an, important, battle, in, that, war, likewise, various, eclipses, and, other, astronomical, events, described, in, ancient, records, can, be, used, to, astronomically, synchronize, historical, events, another, method, to, synchronize, events, is, the, use, of, archaeological, findings, such, as, pottery, to, do, sequence, dating, aspects, and, examples, of, non, chronological, story, telling
