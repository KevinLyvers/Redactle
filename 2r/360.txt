the, american, revolution, was, a, rebellion, and, political, movement, in, the, thirteen, colonies, which, peaked, when, colonists, initiated, an, ultimately, successful, war, for, independence, against, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, leaders, of, the, american, revolution, were, colonial, separatist, leaders, who, originally, sought, more, autonomy, as, british, subjects, but, later, assembled, to, support, the, revolutionary, war, which, ended, british, colonial, rule, over, the, colonies, establishing, their, independence, as, the, united, states, of, america, in, july, 1776, discontent, with, colonial, rule, began, shortly, after, the, defeat, of, france, in, the, french, and, indian, war, in, 1763, although, the, colonies, had, fought, and, supported, the, war, parliament, imposed, new, taxes, to, compensate, for, wartime, costs, and, turned, control, of, the, colonies, western, lands, over, to, the, british, officials, in, montreal, representatives, from, several, colonies, convened, the, stamp, act, congress, its, declaration, of, rights, and, grievances, argued, that, taxation, without, representation, violated, their, rights, as, englishmen, in, 1767, tensions, flared, again, following, the, british, parliament, s, passage, of, the, townshend, acts, in, an, effort, to, quell, the, mounting, rebellion, king, george, iii, deployed, troops, to, boston, a, local, confrontation, resulted, in, the, troops, killing, protesters, in, the, boston, massacre, on, march, 5, 1770, in, 1772, anti, tax, demonstrators, in, rhode, island, destroyed, the, royal, navy, customs, schooner, gaspee, on, december, 16, 1773, activists, disguised, as, indians, instigated, the, boston, tea, party, and, dumped, chests, of, tea, owned, by, the, british, east, india, company, into, boston, harbor, london, closed, boston, harbor, and, enacted, a, series, of, punitive, laws, which, effectively, ended, self, government, in, massachusetts, in, late, 1774, 12, of, the, thirteen, colonies, georgia, joined, in, 1775, sent, delegates, to, the, first, continental, congress, in, philadelphia, it, began, coordinating, patriot, resistance, through, underground, networks, of, committees, in, april, 1775, british, forces, attempted, to, disarm, local, militias, around, boston, and, engaged, them, on, june, 14, 1775, the, second, continental, congress, responded, by, authorizing, formation, of, the, continental, army, and, appointing, george, washington, as, its, commander, in, chief, in, august, the, king, proclaimed, massachusetts, to, be, in, a, state, of, open, defiance, and, rebellion, the, continental, army, surrounded, boston, and, the, british, withdrew, by, sea, in, march, 1776, leaving, the, patriots, in, control, in, every, colony, in, july, 1776, the, second, continental, congress, began, to, take, on, the, role, of, governing, a, new, nation, it, passed, the, lee, resolution, for, national, independence, on, july, 2, and, on, july, 4, 1776, adopted, the, declaration, of, independence, which, embodied, the, political, philosophies, of, liberalism, and, republicanism, rejected, monarchy, and, aristocracy, and, famously, proclaimed, that, all, men, are, created, equal, the, fighting, continued, for, five, years, now, known, as, the, revolutionary, war, during, that, time, the, kingdoms, of, france, and, spain, entered, as, allies, of, the, united, states, the, decisive, victory, came, in, the, fall, of, 1781, when, the, combined, american, and, french, armies, captured, an, entire, british, army, in, the, siege, of, yorktown, the, defeat, led, to, the, collapse, of, king, george, s, control, of, parliament, with, a, majority, now, in, favor, of, ending, the, war, on, american, terms, on, september, 3, 1783, the, british, signed, the, treaty, of, paris, giving, the, united, states, nearly, all, the, territory, east, of, the, mississippi, river, and, south, of, the, great, lakes, about, 60, 000, loyalists, migrated, to, other, british, territories, in, canada, and, elsewhere, but, the, great, majority, remained, in, the, united, states, with, its, victory, in, the, american, revolution, the, united, states, became, the, first, constitutional, republic, in, world, history, founded, on, the, consent, of, the, governed, and, the, rule, of, law, from, the, start, of, english, colonization, of, the, americas, the, english, government, pursued, a, policy, of, mercantilism, to, grow, england, s, economic, and, political, power, by, restricting, imports, promoting, exports, regulating, commerce, gaining, access, to, new, natural, resources, and, accumulating, new, precious, metals, as, monetary, reserves, mercantilist, policies, were, a, defining, feature, of, several, english, american, colonies, from, their, inception, the, original, 1606, charter, of, the, virginia, company, regulated, trade, in, what, would, become, the, colony, of, virginia, in, general, the, export, of, raw, materials, to, foreign, lands, was, banned, imports, of, foreign, goods, were, discouraged, and, cabotage, was, restricted, to, english, vessels, these, regulations, were, enforced, by, the, royal, navy, following, the, parliamentarian, victory, in, the, english, civil, war, the, first, mercantilist, legislation, was, passed, in, 1651, the, rump, parliament, passed, the, first, of, the, navigation, acts, intended, to, both, improve, england, s, trade, ties, with, its, colonies, and, to, address, dutch, domination, of, the, trans, atlantic, trade, at, the, time, this, led, to, the, outbreak, of, war, with, the, netherlands, the, following, year, after, the, restoration, the, 1651, act, was, repealed, but, the, cavalier, parliament, passed, a, series, of, even, more, restrictive, navigation, acts, colonial, reactions, to, these, policies, were, mixed, the, acts, prohibited, exports, of, tobacco, and, other, raw, materials, to, non, english, territories, which, prevented, many, planters, from, receiving, higher, prices, for, their, goods, additionally, merchants, were, restricted, from, importing, certain, goods, and, materials, from, other, nations, harming, profits, these, factors, led, to, smuggling, among, colonial, merchants, especially, following, passage, of, the, molasses, act, on, the, other, hand, certain, merchants, and, local, industries, benefitted, from, the, restrictions, on, foreign, competition, the, restrictions, on, foreign, built, ships, also, greatly, benefitted, the, colonial, shipbuilding, industry, particularly, of, the, new, england, colonies, some, argue, that, the, economic, impact, was, minimal, on, the, colonists, but, the, political, friction, which, the, acts, triggered, was, more, serious, as, the, merchants, most, directly, affected, were, also, the, most, politically, active, the, 1660, restoration, of, king, charles, ii, to, the, english, throne, influenced, the, development, of, a, unique, american, character, new, england, had, strong, puritan, heritage, and, had, supported, the, parliamentarian, commonwealth, government, that, was, responsible, for, the, execution, of, his, father, charles, i, massachusetts, did, not, recognize, the, legitimacy, of, charles, ii, s, reign, for, more, than, a, year, after, its, onset, king, philip, s, war, was, fought, from, 1675, to, 1678, between, the, new, england, colonies, and, a, handful, of, indigenous, tribes, it, was, fought, without, military, assistance, from, england, thereby, contributing, to, the, development, of, a, unique, american, identity, separate, from, that, of, the, british, people, charles, then, became, determined, to, bring, the, new, england, colonies, under, a, more, centralized, administration, and, direct, english, control, in, the, 1680s, the, new, england, colonists, fiercely, opposed, his, efforts, and, the, crown, nullified, their, colonial, charters, in, response, charles, successor, james, ii, finalized, these, efforts, in, 1686, establishing, the, consolidated, dominion, of, new, england, which, also, included, the, formerly, separate, colonies, of, new, york, and, new, jersey, edmund, andros, was, appointed, royal, governor, and, tasked, with, governing, the, new, dominion, under, his, direct, rule, colonial, assemblies, and, town, meetings, were, restricted, new, taxes, were, levied, and, rights, were, abridged, dominion, rule, triggered, bitter, resentment, throughout, new, england, new, englanders, were, encouraged, however, by, a, change, of, government, in, england, which, saw, king, james, ii, effectively, abdicate, and, a, populist, uprising, in, boston, overthrew, dominion, rule, on, april, 18, 1689, colonial, governments, reasserted, their, control, after, the, revolt, the, new, monarchs, william, and, mary, granted, new, charters, to, the, individual, new, england, colonies, and, local, democratic, self, government, was, restored, subsequent, british, governments, continued, in, their, efforts, to, tax, certain, goods, however, passing, acts, regulating, the, trade, of, wool, hats, and, molasses, the, molasses, act, of, 1733, was, particularly, egregious, to, the, colonists, as, a, significant, part, of, colonial, trade, relied, on, molasses, the, taxes, severely, damaged, the, new, england, economy, and, resulted, in, a, surge, of, smuggling, bribery, and, intimidation, of, customs, officials, colonial, wars, fought, in, america, were, also, a, source, of, considerable, tension, for, example, new, england, colonial, forces, captured, the, fortress, of, louisbourg, in, acadia, during, king, george, s, war, in, 1745, but, the, british, government, then, ceded, it, back, to, france, in, 1748, in, exchange, for, chennai, in, far, off, india, new, england, colonists, resented, their, losses, of, lives, as, well, as, the, effort, and, expenditure, involved, in, subduing, the, fortress, only, to, have, it, returned, to, their, erstwhile, enemy, who, would, remain, a, threat, to, them, after, the, war, some, writers, begin, their, histories, of, the, american, revolution, with, the, british, coalition, victory, in, the, seven, years, war, in, 1763, viewing, the, french, and, indian, war, as, though, it, were, the, american, theater, of, the, seven, years, war, lawrence, henry, gipson, writes, it, may, be, said, as, truly, that, the, american, revolution, was, an, aftermath, of, the, anglo, french, conflict, in, the, new, world, carried, on, between, 1754, and, 1763, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, redrew, boundaries, of, the, lands, west, of, newly, british, quebec, and, west, of, a, line, running, along, the, crest, of, the, allegheny, mountains, making, them, indigenous, territory, barred, to, colonial, settlement, for, two, years, the, colonists, protested, and, the, boundary, line, was, adjusted, in, a, series, of, treaties, with, indigenous, tribes, in, 1768, the, iroquois, agreed, to, the, treaty, of, fort, stanwix, and, the, cherokee, agreed, to, the, treaty, of, hard, labour, followed, in, 1770, by, the, treaty, of, lochaber, the, treaties, opened, most, of, what, is, present, day, kentucky, and, west, virginia, to, colonial, settlement, the, new, map, was, drawn, up, at, the, treaty, of, fort, stanwix, which, moved, the, line, much, farther, to, the, west, in, 1764, parliament, passed, the, sugar, act, decreasing, the, existing, customs, duties, on, sugar, and, molasses, but, providing, stricter, measures, of, enforcement, and, collection, that, same, year, prime, minister, george, grenville, proposed, direct, taxes, on, the, colonies, to, raise, revenue, but, he, delayed, action, to, see, whether, the, colonies, would, propose, some, way, to, raise, the, revenue, themselves, grenville, asserted, in, 1762, that, the, whole, revenue, of, the, custom, houses, in, america, amounted, to, one, or, two, thousand, pounds, sterling, a, year, and, that, the, english, exchequer, was, paying, between, seven, and, eight, thousand, pounds, a, year, to, collect, adam, smith, wrote, in, the, wealth, of, nations, that, parliament, has, never, hitherto, demanded, of, anything, which, even, approached, to, a, just, proportion, to, what, was, paid, by, their, fellow, subjects, at, home, benjamin, franklin, would, later, testify, in, parliament, in, 1766, to, the, contrary, reporting, that, americans, already, contributed, heavily, to, the, defense, of, the, empire, he, argued, that, local, colonial, governments, had, raised, outfitted, and, paid, 25, 000, soldiers, to, fight, france, in, just, the, french, and, indian, war, alone, as, many, as, britain, itself, sent, and, spent, many, millions, from, american, treasuries, doing, so, the, british, were, however, reacting, to, an, entirely, different, issue, at, the, conclusion, of, the, recent, war, the, crown, had, to, deal, with, approximately, 1, 500, politically, well, connected, british, army, officers, the, decision, was, made, to, keep, them, on, active, duty, with, full, pay, and, they, had, to, be, stationed, somewhere, stationing, a, standing, army, in, great, britain, during, peacetime, was, politically, unacceptable, so, they, determined, to, station, them, in, british, america, and, have, americans, pay, them, through, the, new, tax, the, soldiers, had, no, military, mission, they, were, not, there, to, defend, the, colonies, because, there, was, no, current, threat, to, the, colonies, parliament, passed, the, stamp, act, in, march, 1765, which, imposed, direct, taxes, on, the, colonies, for, the, first, time, all, official, documents, newspapers, almanacs, and, pamphlets, were, required, to, have, the, stamps, even, decks, of, playing, cards, the, colonists, did, not, object, that, the, taxes, were, high, they, were, actually, low, they, objected, to, their, lack, of, representation, in, the, parliament, which, gave, them, no, voice, concerning, legislation, that, affected, them, such, as, the, tax, violating, the, unwritten, english, constitution, this, grievance, was, summarized, in, the, slogan, no, taxation, without, representation, shortly, following, adoption, of, the, stamp, act, the, sons, of, liberty, formed, and, began, using, public, demonstrations, boycotts, and, threats, of, violence, to, ensure, that, the, british, tax, laws, became, unenforceable, in, boston, the, sons, of, liberty, burned, the, records, of, the, vice, admiralty, court, and, looted, the, home, of, chief, justice, thomas, hutchinson, several, legislatures, called, for, united, action, and, nine, colonies, sent, delegates, to, the, stamp, act, congress, in, new, york, city, in, october, moderates, led, by, john, dickinson, drew, up, a, declaration, of, rights, and, grievances, stating, that, the, colonists, were, equal, to, all, other, british, citizens, and, that, taxes, passed, without, representation, violated, their, rights, as, englishmen, and, congress, emphasized, their, determination, by, organizing, a, boycott, on, imports, of, all, british, merchandise, american, spokesmen, such, as, samuel, adams, james, otis, john, hancock, john, dickinson, thomas, paine, and, many, others, rejected, aristocracy, and, propounded, republicanism, as, the, political, philosophy, that, was, best, suited, to, american, conditions, the, parliament, at, westminster, saw, itself, as, the, supreme, lawmaking, authority, throughout, the, empire, and, thus, entitled, to, levy, any, tax, without, colonial, approval, or, even, consultation, they, argued, that, the, colonies, were, legally, british, corporations, subordinate, to, the, british, parliament, parliament, insisted, that, the, colonists, effectively, enjoyed, a, virtual, representation, as, most, british, people, did, since, only, a, small, minority, of, the, british, population, were, eligible, to, elect, representatives, to, parliament, however, americans, such, as, james, otis, maintained, that, there, was, no, one, in, parliament, responsible, specifically, to, any, colonial, constituency, so, they, were, not, virtually, represented, by, anyone, in, parliament, the, rockingham, government, came, to, power, in, july, 1765, and, parliament, debated, whether, to, repeal, the, stamp, tax, or, to, send, an, army, to, enforce, it, benjamin, franklin, appeared, before, them, to, make, the, case, for, repeal, explaining, that, the, colonies, had, spent, heavily, in, manpower, money, and, blood, defending, the, empire, and, that, further, taxes, to, pay, for, those, wars, were, unjust, and, might, bring, about, a, rebellion, parliament, agreed, and, repealed, the, tax, on, february, 21, 1766, but, they, insisted, in, the, declaratory, act, of, march, 1766, that, they, retained, full, power, to, make, laws, for, the, colonies, in, all, cases, whatsoever, the, repeal, nonetheless, caused, widespread, celebrations, in, the, colonies, in, 1767, the, british, parliament, passed, the, townshend, acts, which, placed, duties, on, several, staple, goods, including, paper, glass, and, tea, and, established, a, board, of, customs, in, boston, to, more, rigorously, execute, trade, regulations, parliament, s, goal, was, not, so, much, to, collect, revenue, but, to, assert, its, authority, over, the, colonies, the, new, taxes, were, enacted, on, the, belief, that, americans, only, objected, to, internal, taxes, and, not, to, external, taxes, such, as, custom, duties, however, in, his, widely, read, pamphlet, letters, from, a, farmer, in, pennsylvania, john, dickinson, argued, against, the, constitutionality, of, the, acts, because, their, purpose, was, to, raise, revenue, and, not, to, regulate, trade, colonists, responded, to, the, taxes, by, organizing, new, boycotts, of, british, goods, these, boycotts, were, less, effective, however, as, the, goods, taxed, by, the, townshend, acts, were, widely, used, in, february, 1768, the, assembly, of, massachusetts, bay, colony, issued, a, circular, letter, to, the, other, colonies, urging, them, to, coordinate, resistance, the, governor, dissolved, the, assembly, when, it, refused, to, rescind, the, letter, meanwhile, a, riot, broke, out, in, boston, in, june, 1768, over, the, seizure, of, the, sloop, liberty, owned, by, john, hancock, for, alleged, smuggling, customs, officials, were, forced, to, flee, prompting, the, british, to, deploy, troops, to, boston, a, boston, town, meeting, declared, that, no, obedience, was, due, to, parliamentary, laws, and, called, for, the, convening, of, a, convention, a, convention, assembled, but, only, issued, a, mild, protest, before, dissolving, itself, in, january, 1769, parliament, responded, to, the, unrest, by, reactivating, the, treason, act, 1543, which, called, for, subjects, outside, the, realm, to, face, trials, for, treason, in, england, the, governor, of, massachusetts, was, instructed, to, collect, evidence, of, said, treason, and, the, threat, caused, widespread, outrage, though, it, was, not, carried, out, on, march, 5, 1770, a, large, crowd, gathered, around, a, group, of, british, soldiers, on, a, boston, street, the, crowd, grew, threatening, throwing, snowballs, rocks, and, debris, at, them, one, soldier, was, clubbed, and, fell, there, was, no, order, to, fire, but, the, soldiers, panicked, and, fired, into, the, crowd, they, hit, 11, people, three, civilians, died, of, wounds, at, the, scene, of, the, shooting, and, two, died, shortly, after, the, event, quickly, came, to, be, called, the, boston, massacre, the, soldiers, were, tried, and, acquitted, defended, by, john, adams, but, the, widespread, descriptions, soon, began, to, turn, colonial, sentiment, against, the, british, this, accelerated, the, downward, spiral, in, the, relationship, between, britain, and, the, province, of, massachusetts, a, new, ministry, under, lord, north, came, to, power, in, 1770, and, parliament, repealed, most, of, the, townshend, duties, except, the, tax, on, tea, this, temporarily, resolved, the, crisis, and, the, boycott, of, british, goods, largely, ceased, with, only, the, more, radical, patriots, such, as, samuel, adams, continuing, to, agitate, in, june, 1772, american, patriots, including, john, brown, burned, a, british, warship, that, had, been, vigorously, enforcing, unpopular, trade, regulations, in, what, became, known, as, the, gaspee, affair, the, affair, was, investigated, for, possible, treason, but, no, action, was, taken, in, 1773, private, letters, were, published, in, which, massachusetts, governor, thomas, hutchinson, claimed, that, the, colonists, could, not, enjoy, all, english, liberties, and, in, which, lieutenant, governor, andrew, oliver, called, for, the, direct, payment, of, colonial, officials, which, had, been, paid, by, local, authorities, this, would, have, reduced, the, influence, of, colonial, representatives, over, their, government, the, letters, contents, were, used, as, evidence, of, a, systematic, plot, against, american, rights, and, discredited, hutchinson, in, the, eyes, of, the, people, the, colonial, assembly, petitioned, for, his, recall, benjamin, franklin, postmaster, general, for, the, colonies, acknowledged, that, he, leaked, the, letters, which, led, to, him, being, removed, from, his, position, in, boston, samuel, adams, set, about, creating, new, committees, of, correspondence, which, linked, patriots, in, all, 13, colonies, and, eventually, provided, the, framework, for, a, rebel, government, virginia, the, largest, colony, set, up, its, committee, of, correspondence, in, early, 1773, on, which, patrick, henry, and, thomas, jefferson, served, a, total, of, about, 7, 000, to, 8, 000, patriots, served, on, these, committees, loyalists, were, excluded, the, committees, became, the, leaders, of, the, american, resistance, to, british, actions, and, later, largely, determined, the, war, effort, at, the, state, and, local, level, when, the, first, continental, congress, decided, to, boycott, british, products, the, colonial, and, local, committees, took, charge, examining, merchant, records, and, publishing, the, names, of, merchants, who, attempted, to, defy, the, boycott, by, importing, british, goods, meanwhile, parliament, passed, the, tea, act, lowering, the, price, of, taxed, tea, exported, to, the, colonies, to, help, the, british, east, india, company, undersell, smuggled, untaxed, dutch, tea, special, consignees, were, appointed, to, sell, the, tea, to, bypass, colonial, merchants, the, act, was, opposed, by, those, who, resisted, the, taxes, and, also, by, smugglers, who, stood, to, lose, business, in, every, colony, demonstrators, warned, merchants, not, to, bring, in, tea, that, included, the, hated, new, tax, in, most, instances, the, consignees, were, forced, by, the, americans, to, resign, and, the, tea, was, turned, back, but, massachusetts, governor, hutchinson, refused, to, allow, boston, merchants, to, give, in, to, pressure, a, town, meeting, in, boston, determined, that, the, tea, would, not, be, landed, and, ignored, a, demand, from, the, governor, to, disperse, on, december, 16, 1773, a, group, of, men, led, by, samuel, adams, and, dressed, to, evoke, the, appearance, of, indigenous, people, boarded, the, ships, of, the, east, india, company, and, dumped, 10, 000, worth, of, tea, from, their, holds, approximately, 636, 000, in, 2008, into, boston, harbor, decades, later, this, event, became, known, as, the, boston, tea, party, and, remains, a, significant, part, of, american, patriotic, lore, the, british, government, responded, by, passing, four, laws, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, intolerable, acts, further, darkening, colonial, opinion, towards, england, the, first, was, the, massachusetts, government, act, which, altered, the, massachusetts, charter, and, restricted, town, meetings, the, second, was, the, administration, of, justice, act, which, ordered, that, all, british, soldiers, to, be, tried, were, to, be, arraigned, in, britain, not, in, the, colonies, the, third, was, the, boston, port, act, which, closed, the, port, of, boston, until, the, british, had, been, compensated, for, the, tea, lost, in, the, boston, tea, party, the, fourth, was, the, quartering, act, of, 1774, which, allowed, royal, governors, to, house, british, troops, in, the, homes, of, citizens, without, permission, of, the, owner, in, response, massachusetts, patriots, issued, the, suffolk, resolves, and, formed, an, alternative, shadow, government, known, as, the, provincial, congress, which, began, training, militia, outside, british, occupied, boston, in, september, 1774, the, first, continental, congress, convened, consisting, of, representatives, from, each, colony, to, serve, as, a, vehicle, for, deliberation, and, collective, action, during, secret, debates, conservative, joseph, galloway, proposed, the, creation, of, a, colonial, parliament, that, would, be, able, to, approve, or, disapprove, acts, of, the, british, parliament, but, his, idea, was, tabled, in, a, vote, of, 6, to, 5, and, was, subsequently, removed, from, the, record, congress, called, for, a, boycott, beginning, on, december, 1, 1774, of, all, british, goods, it, was, enforced, by, new, local, committees, authorized, by, the, congress, it, also, began, coordinating, patriot, resistance, by, militias, which, existed, in, every, colony, and, which, had, gained, military, experience, in, the, french, and, indian, war, for, the, first, time, the, patriots, were, armed, and, unified, against, parliament, king, george, declared, massachusetts, to, be, in, a, state, of, rebellion, in, february, 1775, and, the, british, garrison, received, orders, to, seize, the, rebels, weapons, and, arrest, their, leaders, leading, to, the, battles, of, lexington, and, concord, on, april, 19, 1775, the, patriots, assembled, a, militia, 15, 000, strong, and, laid, siege, to, boston, occupied, by, 6500, british, soldiers, the, second, continental, congress, convened, in, philadelphia, on, june, 14, 1775, the, congress, was, divided, on, the, best, course, of, action, they, authorized, formation, of, the, continental, army, and, appointed, george, washington, as, its, commander, in, chief, and, produced, the, olive, branch, petition, in, which, they, attempted, to, come, to, an, accord, with, king, george, the, king, however, issued, a, proclamation, of, rebellion, which, declared, that, the, states, were, in, rebellion, and, the, members, of, congress, were, traitors, the, battle, of, bunker, hill, followed, on, june, 17, 1775, it, was, a, british, victory, but, at, a, great, cost, about, 1, 000, british, casualties, from, a, garrison, of, about, 6, 000, as, compared, to, 500, american, casualties, from, a, much, larger, force, as, benjamin, franklin, wrote, to,

americans, invaded, northeastern, quebec, under, generals, benedict, arnold, and, richard, montgomery, expecting, to, rally, sympathetic, colonists, there, the, attack, was, a, failure, many, americans, were, killed, captured, or, died, of, smallpox, in, march, 1776, aided, by, the, fortification, of, dorchester, heights, with, cannons, recently, captured, at, fort, ticonderoga, the, continental, army, led, by, george, washington, forced, the, british, to, evacuate, boston, the, revolutionaries, now, fully, controlled, all, thirteen, colonies, and, were, ready, to, declare, independence, there, still, were, many, loyalists, but, they, were, no, longer, in, control, anywhere, by, july, 1776, and, all, of, the, royal, officials, had, fled, following, the, battle, of, bunker, hill, in, june, 1775, the, patriots, had, control, of, massachusetts, outside, boston, s, city, limits, and, the, loyalists, suddenly, found, themselves, on, the, defensive, with, no, protection, from, the, british, army, in, each, of, the, thirteen, colonies, american, patriots, overthrew, their, existing, governments, closed, courts, and, drove, out, british, colonial, officials, they, held, elected, conventions, and, established, their, own, legislatures, which, existed, outside, any, legal, parameters, established, by, the, british, new, constitutions, were, drawn, up, in, each, state, to, supersede, royal, charters, they, proclaimed, that, they, were, now, states, no, longer, colonies, on, january, 5, 1776, new, hampshire, ratified, the, first, state, constitution, in, may, 1776, congress, voted, to, suppress, all, forms, of, crown, authority, to, be, replaced, by, locally, created, authority, new, jersey, south, carolina, and, virginia, created, their, constitutions, before, july, 4, rhode, island, and, connecticut, simply, took, their, existing, royal, charters, and, deleted, all, references, to, the, crown, the, new, states, were, all, committed, to, republicanism, with, no, inherited, offices, on, may, 26, 1776, john, adams, wrote, james, sullivan, from, philadelphia, warning, against, extending, the, franchise, too, far, depend, upon, it, sir, it, is, dangerous, to, open, so, fruitful, a, source, of, controversy, and, altercation, as, would, be, opened, by, attempting, to, alter, the, qualifications, of, voters, there, will, be, no, end, of, it, new, claims, will, arise, women, will, demand, a, vote, lads, from, twelve, to, twenty, one, will, think, their, rights, not, enough, attended, to, and, every, man, who, has, not, a, farthing, will, demand, an, equal, voice, with, any, other, in, all, acts, of, state, it, tends, to, confound, and, destroy, all, distinctions, and, prostrate, all, ranks, to, one, common, level, the, resulting, constitutions, in, states, including, those, of, delaware, maryland, massachusetts, new, york, and, virginia, featured, in, pennsylvania, new, jersey, and, new, hampshire, the, resulting, constitutions, embodied, the, radical, provisions, of, pennsylvania, s, constitution, lasted, 14, years, in, 1790, conservatives, gained, power, in, the, state, legislature, called, a, new, constitutional, convention, and, rewrote, the, constitution, the, new, constitution, substantially, reduced, universal, male, suffrage, gave, the, governor, veto, power, and, patronage, appointment, authority, and, added, an, upper, house, with, substantial, wealth, qualifications, to, the, unicameral, legislature, thomas, paine, called, it, a, constitution, unworthy, of, america, in, april, 1776, the, north, carolina, provincial, congress, issued, the, halifax, resolves, explicitly, authorizing, its, delegates, to, vote, for, independence, by, june, nine, provincial, congresses, were, ready, for, independence, pennsylvania, delaware, maryland, and, new, york, followed, richard, henry, lee, was, instructed, by, the, virginia, legislature, to, propose, independence, and, he, did, so, on, june, 7, 1776, on, june, 11, a, committee, was, created, by, the, second, continental, congress, to, draft, a, document, explaining, the, justifications, for, separation, from, britain, after, securing, enough, votes, for, passage, independence, was, voted, for, on, july, 2, gathered, at, pennsylvania, state, house, in, philadelphia, 56, of, the, nation, s, founding, fathers, representing, america, s, thirteen, colonies, unanimously, adopted, and, issued, to, king, george, iii, the, declaration, of, independence, which, was, drafted, largely, by, thomas, jefferson, and, presented, by, the, committee, of, five, which, had, been, charged, with, its, development, the, congress, struck, several, provisions, of, jefferson, s, draft, and, then, adopted, it, unanimously, on, july, 4, the, declaration, embodied, the, political, philosophies, of, liberalism, and, republicanism, rejected, monarchy, and, aristocracy, and, famously, proclaimed, that, all, men, are, created, equal, with, the, issuance, of, the, declaration, of, independence, each, colony, began, operating, as, independent, and, sovereign, states, the, next, step, was, to, form, a, union, to, facilitate, international, relations, and, alliances, on, november, 5, 1777, the, congress, approved, the, articles, of, confederation, and, perpetual, union, and, sent, it, to, each, state, for, ratification, the, congress, immediately, began, operating, under, the, articles, terms, providing, a, structure, of, shared, sovereignty, during, prosecution, of, the, revolutionary, war, and, facilitating, international, relations, and, alliances, the, articles, were, fully, ratified, on, march, 1, 1781, at, that, point, the, continental, congress, was, dissolved, and, a, new, government, of, the, united, states, in, congress, assembled, took, its, place, the, following, day, on, march, 2, 1782, with, samuel, huntington, leading, the, congress, as, presiding, officer, according, to, british, historian, jeremy, black, the, british, had, significant, advantages, including, a, highly, trained, army, the, world, s, largest, navy, and, an, efficient, system, of, public, finance, that, could, easily, fund, the, war, however, they, seriously, misunderstood, the, depth, of, support, for, the, american, patriot, position, misinterpreting, the, situation, as, merely, a, large, scale, riot, the, british, government, believed, that, they, could, overawe, the, americans, by, sending, a, large, military, and, naval, force, convinced, that, the, revolution, was, the, work, of, a, full, few, miscreants, who, had, rallied, an, armed, rabble, to, their, cause, they, expected, that, the, revolutionaries, would, be, intimidated, then, the, vast, majority, of, americans, who, were, loyal, but, cowed, by, the, terroristic, tactics, would, rise, up, kick, out, the, rebels, and, restore, loyal, government, in, each, colony, washington, forced, the, british, out, of, boston, in, the, spring, of, 1776, and, neither, the, british, nor, the, loyalists, controlled, any, significant, areas, the, british, however, were, amassing, forces, at, their, naval, base, at, halifax, nova, scotia, they, returned, in, force, in, july, 1776, landing, in, new, york, and, defeating, washington, s, continental, army, in, august, at, the, battle, of, brooklyn, this, gave, the, british, control, of, new, york, city, and, its, strategic, harbor, following, that, victory, they, requested, a, meeting, with, representatives, from, congress, to, negotiate, an, end, to, hostilities, a, delegation, including, john, adams, and, benjamin, franklin, met, british, admiral, richard, howe, on, staten, island, in, new, york, harbor, on, september, 11, in, what, became, known, as, the, staten, island, peace, conference, howe, demanded, that, the, americans, retract, the, declaration, of, independence, which, they, refused, to, do, and, negotiations, ended, the, british, then, seized, new, york, city, and, nearly, captured, washington, s, army, they, made, the, city, their, main, political, and, military, base, of, operations, holding, it, until, november, 1783, the, city, became, the, destination, for, loyalist, refugees, and, a, focal, point, of, washington, s, intelligence, network, the, british, also, took, new, jersey, pushing, the, continental, army, into, pennsylvania, washington, crossed, the, delaware, river, back, into, new, jersey, in, a, surprise, attack, in, late, december, 1776, and, defeated, the, hessian, and, british, armies, at, trenton, and, princeton, thereby, regaining, control, of, most, of, new, jersey, the, victories, gave, an, important, boost, to, patriots, at, a, time, when, morale, was, flagging, and, they, have, become, iconic, events, of, the, war, in, september, 1777, in, anticipation, of, a, coordinated, attack, by, the, british, army, on, the, revolutionary, capital, of, philadelphia, the, continental, congress, was, forced, to, depart, philadelphia, temporarily, for, baltimore, where, they, continued, deliberations, in, 1777, the, british, sent, burgoyne, s, invasion, force, from, canada, south, to, new, york, to, seal, off, new, england, their, aim, was, to, isolate, new, england, which, the, british, perceived, as, the, primary, source, of, agitation, rather, than, move, north, to, support, burgoyne, the, british, army, in, new, york, city, went, to, philadelphia, in, a, major, case, of, mis, coordination, capturing, it, from, washington, the, invasion, army, under, burgoyne, was, much, too, slow, and, became, trapped, in, northern, new, york, state, it, surrendered, after, the, battles, of, saratoga, in, october, 1777, from, early, october, 1777, until, november, 15, a, siege, distracted, british, troops, at, fort, mifflin, philadelphia, pennsylvania, and, allowed, washington, time, to, preserve, the, continental, army, by, safely, leading, his, troops, to, harsh, winter, quarters, at, valley, forge, on, august, 23, 1775, george, iii, declared, americans, to, be, traitors, to, the, crown, if, they, took, up, arms, against, royal, authority, there, were, thousands, of, british, and, hessian, soldiers, in, american, hands, following, their, surrender, at, the, battles, of, saratoga, lord, germain, took, a, hard, line, but, the, british, generals, on, american, soil, never, held, treason, trials, and, instead, treated, captured, american, soldiers, as, prisoners, of, war, the, dilemma, was, that, tens, of, thousands, of, loyalists, were, under, american, control, and, american, retaliation, would, have, been, easy, the, british, built, much, of, their, strategy, around, using, these, loyalists, the, british, maltreated, the, prisoners, whom, they, held, resulting, in, more, deaths, to, american, prisoners, of, war, than, from, combat, operations, at, the, end, of, the, war, both, sides, released, their, surviving, prisoners, the, capture, of, a, british, army, at, saratoga, encouraged, the, french, to, formally, enter, the, war, in, support, of, congress, and, benjamin, franklin, negotiated, a, permanent, military, alliance, in, early, 1778, france, thus, became, the, first, foreign, nation, to, officially, recognize, the, declaration, of, independence, on, february, 6, 1778, the, united, states, and, france, signed, the, treaty, of, amity, and, commerce, and, the, treaty, of, alliance, william, pitt, spoke, out, in, parliament, urging, britain, to, make, peace, in, america, and, to, unite, with, america, against, france, while, british, politicians, who, had, sympathized, with, colonial, grievances, now, turned, against, the, americans, for, allying, with, britain, s, rival, and, enemy, the, spanish, and, the, dutch, became, allies, of, the, french, in, 1779, and, 1780, respectively, forcing, the, british, to, fight, a, global, war, without, major, allies, and, requiring, it, to, slip, through, a, combined, blockade, of, the, atlantic, britain, began, to, view, the, american, war, for, independence, as, merely, one, front, in, a, wider, war, and, the, british, chose, to, withdraw, troops, from, america, to, reinforce, the, british, colonies, in, the, caribbean, which, were, under, threat, of, spanish, or, french, invasion, british, commander, sir, henry, clinton, evacuated, philadelphia, and, returned, to, new, york, city, general, washington, intercepted, him, in, the, battle, of, monmouth, court, house, the, last, major, battle, fought, in, the, north, after, an, inconclusive, engagement, the, british, retreated, to, new, york, city, the, northern, war, subsequently, became, a, stalemate, as, the, focus, of, attention, shifted, to, the, smaller, southern, theater, the, british, royal, navy, blockaded, ports, and, held, new, york, city, for, the, duration, of, the, war, and, other, cities, for, brief, periods, but, failed, in, their, effort, to, destroy, washington, s, forces, the, british, strategy, now, concentrated, on, a, campaign, in, the, southern, states, with, fewer, regular, troops, at, their, disposal, the, british, commanders, saw, the, southern, strategy, as, a, more, viable, plan, as, they, perceived, the, south, as, strongly, loyalist, with, a, large, population, of, recent, immigrants, and, large, numbers, of, slaves, who, might, be, tempted, to, run, away, from, their, masters, to, join, the, british, and, gain, their, freedom, beginning, in, late, december, 1778, the, british, captured, savannah, and, controlled, the, georgia, coastline, in, 1780, they, launched, a, fresh, invasion, and, took, charleston, a, significant, victory, at, the, battle, of, camden, meant, that, royal, forces, soon, controlled, most, of, georgia, and, south, carolina, the, british, set, up, a, network, of, forts, inland, hoping, that, the, loyalists, would, rally, to, the, flag, not, enough, loyalists, turned, out, however, and, the, british, had, to, fight, their, way, north, into, north, carolina, and, virginia, with, a, severely, weakened, army, behind, them, much, of, the, territory, that, they, had, already, captured, dissolved, into, a, chaotic, guerrilla, war, fought, predominantly, between, bands, of, loyalists, and, american, militia, which, negated, many, of, the, gains, that, the, british, had, previously, made, the, british, army, under, cornwallis, marched, to, yorktown, virginia, where, they, expected, to, be, rescued, by, a, british, fleet, the, fleet, did, arrive, but, so, did, a, larger, french, fleet, the, french, were, victorious, in, the, battle, of, the, chesapeake, and, the, british, fleet, returned, to, new, york, for, reinforcements, leaving, cornwallis, trapped, in, october, 1781, the, british, surrendered, their, second, invading, army, of, the, war, under, a, siege, by, the, combined, french, and, continental, armies, commanded, by, washington, washington, did, not, know, if, or, when, the, british, might, reopen, hostilities, after, yorktown, they, still, had, 26, 000, troops, occupying, new, york, city, charleston, and, savannah, together, with, a, powerful, fleet, the, french, army, and, navy, departed, so, the, americans, were, on, their, own, in, 1782, 83, the, american, treasury, was, empty, and, the, unpaid, soldiers, were, growing, restive, almost, to, the, point, of, mutiny, or, possible, coup, d, etat, washington, dispelled, the, unrest, among, officers, of, the, newburgh, conspiracy, in, 1783, and, congress, subsequently, created, the, promise, of, a, five, years, bonus, for, all, officers, historians, continue, to, debate, whether, the, odds, were, long, or, short, for, american, victory, john, e, ferling, says, that, the, odds, were, so, long, that, the, american, victory, was, almost, a, miracle, on, the, other, hand, joseph, ellis, says, that, the, odds, favored, the, americans, and, asks, whether, there, ever, was, any, realistic, chance, for, the, british, to, win, he, argues, that, this, opportunity, came, only, once, in, the, summer, of, 1776, and, admiral, howe, and, his, brother, general, howe, missed, several, opportunities, to, destroy, the, continental, army, chance, luck, and, even, the, vagaries, of, the, weather, played, crucial, roles, ellis, s, point, is, that, the, strategic, and, tactical, decisions, of, the, howes, were, fatally, flawed, because, they, underestimated, the, challenges, posed, by, the, patriots, ellis, concludes, that, once, the, howe, brothers, failed, the, opportunity, would, never, come, again, for, a, british, victory, support, for, the, conflict, had, never, been, strong, in, britain, where, many, sympathized, with, the, americans, but, now, it, reached, a, new, low, king, george, wanted, to, fight, on, but, his, supporters, lost, control, of, parliament, and, they, launched, no, further, offensives, in, america, on, the, eastern, seaboard, during, negotiations, in, paris, the, american, delegation, discovered, that, france, supported, american, independence, but, no, territorial, gains, hoping, to, confine, the, new, nation, to, the, area, east, of, the, appalachian, mountains, the, americans, opened, direct, secret, negotiations, with, london, cutting, out, the, french, british, prime, minister, lord, shelburne, was, in, charge, of, the, british, negotiations, and, he, saw, a, chance, to, make, the, united, states, a, valuable, economic, partner, facilitating, trade, and, investment, opportunities, the, us, obtained, all, the, land, east, of, the, mississippi, river, including, southern, canada, but, spain, took, control, of, florida, from, the, british, it, gained, fishing, rights, off, canadian, coasts, and, agreed, to, allow, british, merchants, and, loyalists, to, recover, their, property, prime, minister, shelburne, foresaw, highly, profitable, two, way, trade, between, britain, and, the, rapidly, growing, united, states, which, did, come, to, pass, the, blockade, was, lifted, and, american, merchants, were, free, to, trade, with, any, nation, anywhere, in, the, world, the, british, largely, abandoned, their, indigenous, allies, who, were, not, a, party, to, this, treaty, and, did, not, recognize, it, until, they, were, defeated, militarily, by, the, united, states, however, the, british, did, sell, them, munitions, and, maintain, forts, in, american, territory, until, the, jay, treaty, of, 1795, losing, the, war, and, the, thirteen, colonies, was, a, shock, to, britain, the, war, revealed, the, limitations, of, britain, s, fiscal, military, state, when, they, discovered, that, they, suddenly, faced, powerful, enemies, with, no, allies, and, they, were, dependent, on, extended, and, vulnerable, transatlantic, lines, of, communication, the, defeat, heightened, dissension, and, escalated, political, antagonism, to, the, king, s, ministers, the, king, went, so, far, as, to, draft, letters, of, abdication, although, they, were, never, delivered, inside, parliament, the, primary, concern, changed, from, fears, of, an, over, mighty, monarch, to, the, issues, of, representation, parliamentary, reform, and, government, retrenchment, reformers, sought, to, destroy, what, they, saw, as, widespread, institutional, corruption, and, the, result, was, a, crisis, from, 1776, to, 1783, the, crisis, ended, after, 1784, confidence, in, the, british, constitution, was, restored, during, the, administration, of, prime, minister, william, pitt, britain, s, war, against, the, americans, the, french, and, the, spanish, cost, about, 100, million, the, treasury, borrowed, 40, percent, of, the, money, that, it, needed, britain, had, a, sophisticated, financial, system, based, on, the, wealth, of, thousands, of, landowners, who, supported, the, government, together, with, banks, and, financiers, in, london, in, london, the, british, had, relatively, little, difficulty, financing, their, war, keeping, their, suppliers, and, soldiers, paid, and, hiring, tens, of, thousands, of, german, soldiers, in, sharp, contrast, congress, and, the, american, states, had, no, end, of, difficulty, financing, the, war, in, 1775, there, was, at, most, 12, million, dollars, in, gold, in, the, colonies, not, nearly, enough, to, cover, current, transactions, let, alone, finance, a, major, war, the, british, made, the, situation, much, worse, by, imposing, a, tight, blockade, on, every, american, port, which, cut, off, almost, all, trade, one, partial, solution, was, to, rely, on, volunteer, support, from, militiamen, and, donations, from, patriotic, citizens, another, was, to, delay, actual, payments, pay, soldiers, and, suppliers, in, depreciated, currency, and, promise, that, it, would, be, made, good, after, the, war, indeed, the, soldiers, and, officers, were, given, land, grants, in, 1783, to, cover, the, wages, that, they, had, earned, but, had, not, been, paid, during, the, war, the, national, government, did, not, have, a, strong, leader, in, financial, matters, until, 1781, when, robert, morris, was, named, superintendent, of, finance, of, the, united, states, morris, used, a, french, loan, in, 1782, to, set, up, the, private, bank, of, north, america, to, finance, the, war, he, reduced, the, civil, list, saved, money, by, using, competitive, bidding, for, contracts, tightened, accounting, procedures, and, demanded, the, national, government, s, full, share, of, money, and, supplies, from, the, individual, states, congress, used, four, main, methods, to, cover, the, cost, of, the, war, which, cost, about, 66, million, dollars, in, specie, gold, and, silver, congress, made, issues, of, paper, money, known, colloquially, as, continental, dollars, in, 1775, 1780, and, in, 1780, 1781, the, first, issue, amounted, to, 242, million, dollars, this, paper, money, would, supposedly, be, redeemed, for, state, taxes, but, the, holders, were, eventually, paid, off, in, 1791, at, the, rate, of, one, cent, on, the, dollar, by, 1780, the, paper, money, was, so, devalued, that, the, phrase, not, worth, a, continental, became, synonymous, with, worthlessness, the, skyrocketing, inflation, was, a, hardship, on, the, few, people, who, had, fixed, incomes, but, 90, percent, of, the, people, were, farmers, and, were, not, directly, affected, by, it, debtors, benefited, by, paying, off, their, debts, with, depreciated, paper, the, greatest, burden, was, borne, by, the, soldiers, of, the, continental, army, whose, wages, were, usually, paid, late, and, declined, in, value, every, month, weakening, their, morale, and, adding, to, the, hardships, of, their, families, beginning, in, 1777, congress, repeatedly, asked, the, states, to, provide, money, but, the, states, had, no, system, of, taxation, and, were, of, little, help, by, 1780, congress, was, making, requisitions, for, specific, supplies, of, corn, beef, pork, and, other, necessities, an, inefficient, system, which, barely, kept, the, army, alive, starting, in, 1776, the, congress, sought, to, raise, money, by, loans, from, wealthy, individuals, promising, to, redeem, the, bonds, after, the, war, the, bonds, were, redeemed, in, 1791, at, face, value, but, the, scheme, raised, little, money, because, americans, had, little, specie, and, many, of, the, rich, merchants, were, supporters, of, the, crown, the, french, secretly, supplied, the, americans, with, money, gunpowder, and, munitions, to, weaken, great, britain, the, subsidies, continued, when, france, entered, the, war, in, 1778, and, the, french, government, and, paris, bankers, lent, large, sums, to, the, american, war, effort, the, americans, struggled, to, pay, off, the, loans, they, ceased, making, interest, payments, to, france, in, 1785, and, defaulted, on, installments, due, in, 1787, in, 1790, however, they, resumed, regular, payments, on, their, debts, to, the, french, and, settled, their, accounts, with, the, french, government, in, 1795, when, james, swan, an, american, banker, assumed, responsibility, for, the, balance, of, the, debt, in, exchange, for, the, right, to, refinance, it, at, a, profit, the, war, ended, in, 1783, and, was, followed, by, a, period, of, prosperity, the, national, government, was, still, operating, under, the, articles, of, confederation, and, settled, the, issue, of, the, western, territories, which, the, states, ceded, to, congress, american, settlers, moved, rapidly, into, those, areas, with, vermont, kentucky, and, tennessee, becoming, states, in, the, 1790s, however, the, national, government, had, no, money, either, to, pay, the, war, debts, owed, to, european, nations, and, the, private, banks, or, to, pay, americans, who, had, been, given, millions, of, dollars, of, promissory, notes, for, supplies, during, the, war, nationalists, led, by, washington, alexander, hamilton, and, other, veterans, feared, that, the, new, nation, was, too, fragile, to, withstand, an, international, war, or, even, the, repetition, of, internal, revolts, such, as, the, shays, rebellion, of, 1786, in, massachusetts, they, convinced, congress, to, call, the, philadelphia, convention, in, 1787, the, convention, adopted, a, new, constitution, which, provided, for, a, republic, with, a, much, stronger, national, government, in, a, federal, framework, including, an, effective, executive, in, a, check, and, balance, system, with, the, judiciary, and, legislature, the, constitution, was, ratified, in, 1788, after, a, fierce, debate, in, the, states, over, the, proposed, new, government, the, new, administration, under, president, george, washington, took, office, in, new, york, in, march, 1789, james, madison, spearheaded, congressional, legislation, proposing, amendments, to, the, constitution, as, assurances, to, those, cautious, about, federal, power, guaranteeing, many, of, the, inalienable, rights, that, formed, a, foundation, for, the, revolution, rhode, island, was, the, final, state, to, ratify, the, constitution, in, 1790, the, first, ten, amendments, were, ratified, in, 1791, and, became, known, as, the, united, states, bill, of, rights, the, national, debt, fell, into, three, categories, after, the, american, revolution, the, first, was, the, 12, million, owed, to, foreigners, mostly, money, borrowed, from, france, there, was, general, agreement, to, pay, the, foreign, debts, at, full, value, the, national, government, owed, 40, million, and, state, governments, owed, 25, million, to, americans, who, had, sold, food, horses, and, supplies, to, the, patriot, forces, there, were, also, other, debts, which, consisted, of, promissory, notes, issued, during, the, war, to, soldiers, merchants, and, farmers, who, accepted, these, payments, on, the, premise, that, the, new, constitution, would, create, a, government, that, would, pay, these, debts, eventually, the, war, expenses, of, the, individual, states, added, up, to, 114, million, compared, to, 37, million, by, the, central, government, in, 1790, congress, combined, the, remaining, state, debts, with, the, foreign, and, domestic, debts, into, one, national, debt, totaling, 80, million, at, the, recommendation, of, first, secretary, of, the, treasury, alexander, hamilton, everyone, received, face, value, for, wartime, certificates, so, that, the, national, honor, would, be, sustained, and, the, national, credit, established, the, population, of, the, thirteen, states, was, not, homogeneous, in, political, views, and, attitudes, loyalties, and, allegiances, varied, widely, within, regions, and, communities, and, even, within, families, and, sometimes, shifted, during, the, revolution, the, american, enlightenment, was, a, critical, precursor, of, the, american, revolution, chief, among, the, ideas, of, the, american, enlightenment, were, the, concepts, of, natural, law, natural, rights, consent, of, the, governed, individualism, property, rights, self, ownership, self, determination, liberalism, republicanism, and, defense, against, corruption, a, growing, number, of, american, colonists, embraced, these, views, and, fostered, an, intellectual, environment, which, led, to, a, new, sense, of, political, and, social, identity, john, locke, is, often, referred, to, as, the, philosopher, of, the, american, revolution, due, to, his, work, in, the, social, contract, and, natural, rights, theories, that, underpinned, the, revolution, s, political, ideology, locke, s, two, treatises, of, government, published, in, 1689, was, especially, influential, he, argued, that, all, humans, were, created, equally, free, and, governments, therefore, needed, the, consent, of, the, governed, in, late, eighteenth, century, america, belief, was, still, widespread, in, equality, by, creation, and, rights, by, creation, locke, s, ideas, on, liberty, influenced, the, political, thinking, of, english, writers, such, as, john, trenchard, thomas, gordon, and, benjamin, hoadly, whose, political, ideas, in, turn, also, had, a, strong, influence, on, the, american, patriots, his, work, also, inspired, symbols, used, in, the, american, revolution, such, as, the, appeal, to, heaven, found, on, the, pine, tree, flag, which, alludes, to, locke, s, concept, of, the, right, of, revolution, the, theory, of, the, social, contract, influenced, the, belief, among, many, of, the, founders, that, the, right, of, the, people, to, overthrow, their, leaders, should, those, leaders, betray, the, historic, rights, of, englishmen, was, one, of, the, natural, rights, of, man, the, americans, heavily, relied, on, montesquieu, s, analysis, of, the, wisdom, of, the, balanced, british, constitution, mixed, government, in, writing, the, state, and, national, constitutions, the, american, interpretation, of, republicanism, was, inspired, by, the, whig, party, in, great, britain, which, openly, criticized, the, corruption, within, the, british, government, americans, were, increasingly, embracing, republican, values, seeing, britain, as, corrupt, and, hostile, to, american, interests, the, colonists, associated, political, corruption, with, ostentatious, luxury, and, inherited, aristocracy, the, founding, fathers, were, strong, advocates, of, republican, values, particularly, samuel, adams, patrick, henry, john, adams, benjamin, franklin, thomas, jefferson, thomas, paine, george, washington, james, madison, and, alexander, hamilton, which, required, men, to, put, civic, duty, ahead, of, their, personal, desires, men, were, honor, bound, by, civic, obligation, to, be, prepared, and, willing, to, fight, for, the, rights, and, liberties, of, their, countrymen, john, adams, wrote, to, mercy, otis, warren, in, 1776, agreeing, with, some, classical, greek, and, roman, thinkers, public, virtue, cannot, exist, without, private, and, public, virtue, is, the, only, foundation, of, republics, he, continued, there, must, be, a, positive, passion, for, the, public, good, the, public, interest, honour, power, and, glory, established, in, the, minds, of, the, people, or, there, can, be, no, republican, government, nor, any, real, liberty, and, this, public, passion, must, be, superior, to, all, private, passions, men, must, be, ready, they, must, pride, themselves, and, be, happy, to, sacrifice, their, private, pleasures, passions, and, interests, nay, their, private, friendships, and, dearest, connections, when, they, stand, in, competition, with, the, rights, of, society, protestant, churches, that, had, separated, from, the, church, of, england, called, dissenters, were, the, school, of, democracy, in, the, words, of, historian, patricia, bonomi, before, the, revolution, the, southern, colonies, and, three, of, the, new, england, colonies, had, official, established, churches, congregational, in, massachusetts, bay, connecticut, and, new, hampshire, and, the, church, of, england, in, maryland, virginia, north, carolina, south, carolina, and, georgia, the, new, york, new, jersey, pennsylvania, delaware, and, the, colony, of, rhode, island, and, providence, plantations, had, no, officially, established, churches, church, membership, statistics, from, the, period, are, unreliable, and, scarce, but, what, little, data, exists, indicates, that, the, church, of, england, was, not, in, the, majority, not, even, in, the, colonies, where, it, was, the, established, church, and, they, probably, did, not, comprise, even, 30, percent, of, the, population, in, most, localities, with, the, possible, exception, of, virginia, john, witherspoon, who, was, considered, a, new, light, presbyterian, wrote, widely, circulated, sermons, linking, the, american, revolution, to, the, teachings, of, the, bible, throughout, the, colonies, dissenting, protestant, ministers, from, the, congregational, baptist, and, presbyterian, churches, preached, revolutionary, themes, in, their, sermons, while, most, church, of, england, clergymen, preached, loyalty, to, the, king, the, titular, head, of, the, english, state, church, religious, motivation, for, fighting, tyranny, transcended, socioeconomic, lines, the, declaration, of, independence, also, referred, to, the, laws, of, nature, and, of, nature, s, god, as, justification, for, the, americans, separation, from, the, british, monarchy, the, signers, of, the, declaration, professed, their, firm, reliance, on, the, protection, of, divine, providence, and, they, appealed, to, the, supreme, judge, for, the, rectitude, of, our, intentions, historian, bernard, bailyn, argues, that, the, evangelicalism, of, the, era, challenged, traditional, notions, of, natural, hierarchy, by, preaching, that, the, bible, teaches, that, all, men, are, equal, so, that, the, true, value, of, a, man, lies, in, his, moral, behavior, not, in, his, class, kidd, argues, that, religious, disestablishment, belief, in, god, as, the, source, of, human, rights, and, shared, convictions, about, sin, virtue, and, divine, providence, worked, together, to, unite, rationalists, and, evangelicals, and, thus, encouraged, a, large, proportion, of, americans, to, fight, for, independence, from, the, empire, bailyn, on, the, other, hand, denies, that, religion, played, such, a, critical, role, alan, heimert, argues, that, new, light, anti, authoritarianism, was, essential, to, furthering, democracy, in, colonial, american, society, and, set, the, stage, for, a, confrontation, with, british, monarchical, and, aristocratic, rule, john, adams, concluded, in, 1818, the, revolution, was, effected, before, the, war, commenced, the, revolution, was, in, the, minds, and, hearts, of, the, people, this, radical, change, in, the, principles, opinions, sentiments, and, affections, of, the, people, was, the, real, american, revolution, in, the, mid, 20th, century, historian, leonard, woods, labaree, identified, eight, characteristics, of, the, loyalists, that, made, them, essentially, conservative, opposite, to, the, characteristics, of, the, patriots, loyalists, tended, to, feel, that, resistance, to, the, crown, was, morally, wrong, while, the, patriots, thought, that, morality, was, on, their, side, loyalists, were, alienated, when, the, patriots, resorted, to, violence, such, as, burning, houses, and, tarring, and, feathering, loyalists, wanted, to, take, a, centrist, position, and, resisted, the, patriots, demand, to, declare, their, opposition, to, the, crown, many, loyalists, had, maintained, strong, and, long, standing, relations, with, britain, especially, merchants, in, port, cities, such, as, new, york, and, boston, many, loyalists, felt, that, independence, was, bound, to, come, eventually, but, they, were, fearful, that, revolution, might, lead, to, anarchy, tyranny, or, mob, rule, in, contrast, the, prevailing, attitude, among, patriots, was, a, desire, to, seize, the, initiative, labaree, also, wrote, that, loyalists, were, pessimists, who, lacked, the, confidence, in, the, future, displayed, by, the, patriots, historians, in, the, early, 20th, century, such, as, j, franklin, jameson, examined, the, class, composition, of, the, patriot, cause, looking, for, evidence, of, a, class, war, inside, the, revolution, more, recent, historians, have, largely, abandoned, that, interpretation, emphasizing, instead, the, high, level, of, ideological, unity, both, loyalists, and, patriots, were, a, mixed, lot, but, ideological, demands, always, came, first, the, patriots, viewed, independence, as, a, means, to, gain, freedom, from, british, oppression, and, to, reassert, their, basic, rights, most, yeomen, farmers, craftsmen, and, small, merchants, joined, the, patriot, cause, to, demand, more, political, equality, they, were, especially, successful, in, pennsylvania, but, less, so, in, new, england, where, john, adams, attacked, thomas, paine, s, common, sense, for, the, absurd, democratical, notions, that, it, proposed, the, revolution, became, a, personal, issue, for, the, king, fueled, by, his, growing, belief, that, british, leniency, would, be, taken, as, weakness, by, the, americans, he, also, sincerely, believed, that, he, was, defending, britain, s, constitution, against, usurpers, rather, than, opposing, patriots, fighting, for, their, natural, rights, king, george, iii, is, often, accused, of, obstinately, trying, to, keep, great, britain, at, war, with, the, revolutionaries, in, america, despite, the, opinions, of, his, own, ministers, in, the, words, of, the, british, historian, george, otto, trevelyan, the, king, was, determined, never, to, acknowledge, the, independence, of, the, americans, and, to, punish, their, contumacy, by, the, indefinite, prolongation, of, a, war, which, promised, to, be, eternal, the, king, wanted, to, keep, the, rebels, harassed, anxious, and, poor, until, the, day, when, by, a, natural, and, inevitable, process, discontent, and, disappointment, were, converted, into, penitence, and, remorse, later, historians, defend, george, by, saying, in, the, context, of, the, times, no, king, would, willingly, surrender, such, a, large, territory, and, his, conduct, was, far, less, ruthless, than, contemporary, monarchs, in, europe, after, the, surrender, of, a, british, army, at, saratoga, both, parliament, and, the, british, people, were, largely, in, favor, of, the, war, recruitment, ran, at, high, levels, and, although, political, opponents, were, vocal, they, remained, a, small, minority, with, the, setbacks, in, america, lord, north, asked, to, transfer, power, to, lord, chatham, whom, he, thought, more, capable, but, george, refused, to, do, so, he, suggested, instead, that, chatham, serve, as, a, subordinate, minister, in, north, s, administration, but, chatham, refused, he, died, later, in, the, same, year, lord, north, was, allied, to, the, king, s, friends, in, parliament, and, believed, george, iii, had, the, right, to, exercise, powers, in, early, 1778, britain, s, chief, rival, france, signed, a, treaty, of, alliance, with, the, united, states, and, the, confrontation, soon, escalated, from, a, rebellion, to, something, that, has, been, characterized, as, world, war, the, french, fleet, was, able, to, outrun, the, british, naval, blockade, of, the, mediterranean, and, sailed, to, north, america, the, conflict, now, affected, north, america, europe, and, india, the, united, states, and, france, were, joined, by, spain, in, 1779, and, the, dutch, republic, while, britain, had, no, major, allies, of, its, own, except, for, the, loyalist, minority, in, america, and, german, auxiliaries, i, e, hessians, lord, gower, and, lord, weymouth, both, resigned, from, the, government, lord, north, again, requested, that, he, also, be, allowed, to, resign, but, he, stayed, in, office, at, george, iii, s, insistence, opposition, to, the, costly, war, was, increasing, and, in, june, 1780, contributed, to, disturbances, in, london, known, as, the, gordon, riots, as, late, as, the, siege, of, charleston, in, 1780, loyalists, could, still, believe, in, their, eventual, victory, as, british, troops, inflicted, defeats, on, the, continental, forces, at, the, battle, of, camden, and, the, battle, of, guilford, court, house, in, late, 1781, the, news, of, cornwallis, s, surrender, at, the, siege, of, yorktown, reached, london, lord, north, s, parliamentary, support, ebbed, away, and, he, resigned, the, following, year, the, king, drafted, an, abdication, notice, which, was, never, delivered, finally, accepted, the, defeat, in, north, america, and, authorized, peace, negotiations, the, treaties, of, paris, by, which, britain, recognized, the, independence, of, the, united, states, and, returned, florida, to, spain, were, signed, in, 1782, and, 1783, respectively, in, early, 1783, george, iii, privately, conceded, america, is, lost, he, reflected, that, the, northern, colonies, had, developed, into, britain, s, successful, rivals, in, commercial, trade, and, fishing, when, john, adams, was, appointed, american, minister, to, london, in, 1785, george, had, become, resigned, to, the, new, relationship, between, his, country, and, the, former, colonies, he, told, adams, i, was, the, last, to, consent, to, the, separation, but, the, separation, having, been, made, and, having, become, inevitable, i, have, always, said, as, i, say, now, that, i, would, be, the, first, to, meet, the, friendship, of, the, united, states, as, an, independent, power, those, who, fought, for, independence, were, called, revolutionaries, continentals, rebels, patriots, whigs, congress, men, or, americans, during, and, after, the, war, they, included, a, full, range, of, social, and, economic, classes, but, were, unanimous, regarding, the, need, to, defend, the, rights, of, americans, and, uphold, the, principles, of, republicanism, in, rejecting, monarchy, and, aristocracy, while, emphasizing, civic, virtue, by, citizens, the, signers, of, the, declaration, of, independence, were, mostly, with, definite, exceptions, well, educated, of, british, stock, and, of, the, protestant, faith, newspapers, were, strongholds, of, patriotism, although, there, were, a, few, loyalist, papers, and, printed, many, pamphlets, announcements, patriotic, letters, and, pronouncements, according, to, historian, robert, calhoon, 40, to, 45, percent, of, the, white, population, in, the, thirteen, colonies, supported, the, patriots, cause, 15, to, 20, percent, supported, the, loyalists, and, the, remainder, were, neutral, or, kept, a, low, profile, mark, lender, concludes, that, ordinary, people, became, insurgents, against, the, british, because, they, held, a, sense, of, rights, which, the, british, were, violating, rights, that, stressed, local, autonomy, fair, dealing, and, government, by, consent, they, were, highly, sensitive, to, the, issue, of, tyranny, which, they, saw, manifested, in, the, british, response, to, the, boston, tea, party, the, arrival, in, boston, of, the, british, army, heightened, their, sense, of, violated, rights, leading, to, rage, and, demands, for, revenge, they, had, faith, that, god, was, on, their, side, thomas, paine, published, his, pamphlet, common, sense, in, january, 1776, after, the, revolution, had, started, it, was, widely, distributed, and, often, read, aloud, in, taverns, contributing, significantly, to, concurrently, spreading, the, ideas, of, republicanism, and, liberalism, bolstering, enthusiasm, for, separation, from, great, britain, and, encouraging, recruitment, for, the, continental, army, paine, presented, the, revolution, as, the, solution, for, americans, alarmed, by, the, threat, of, tyranny, the, consensus, of, scholars, is, that, about, 15, to, 20, percent, of, the, white, population, remained, loyal, to, the, british, crown, those, who, actively, supported, the, king, were, known, at, the, time, as, loyalists, tories, or, king, s, men, the, loyalists, never, controlled, territory, unless, the, british, army, occupied, it, they, were, typically, older, less, willing, to, break, with, old, loyalties, and, often, connected, to, the, church, of, england, they, included, many, established, merchants, with, strong, business, connections, throughout, the, empire, as, well, as, royal, officials, such, as, thomas, hutchinson, of, boston, there, were, 500, to, 1, 000, black, loyalists, enslaved, african, americans, who, escaped, to, british, lines, and, supported, britain, s, cause, via, several, means, many, of, them, died, from, disease, but, the, survivors, were, evacuated, by, the, british, to, their, remaining, colonies, in, north, america, the, revolution, could, divide, families, such, as, william, franklin, son, of, benjamin, franklin, and, royal, governor, of, the, province, of, new, jersey, who, remained, loyal, to, the, crown, throughout, the, war, he, and, his, father, never, spoke, again, recent, immigrants, who, had, not, been, fully, americanized, were, also, inclined, to, support, the, king, after, the, war, the, great, majority, of, the, half, million, loyalists, remained, in, america, and, resumed, normal, lives, some, became, prominent, american, leaders, such, as, samuel, seabury, approximately, 46, 000, loyalists, relocated, to, canada, others, moved, to, britain, 7, 000, florida, or, the, west, indies, 9, 000, the, exiles, represented, approximately, two, percent, of, the, total, population, of, the, colonies, nearly, all, black, loyalists, left, for, nova, scotia, florida, or, england, where, they, could, remain, free, loyalists, who, left, the, south, in, 1783, took, thousands, of, their, slaves, with, them, as, they, fled, to, the, british, west, indies, a, minority, of, uncertain, size, tried, to, stay, neutral, in, the, war, most, kept, a, low, profile, but, the, quakers, were, the, most, important, group, to, speak, out, for, neutrality, especially, in, pennsylvania, the, quakers, continued, to, do, business, with, the, british, even, after, the, war, began, and, they, were, accused, of, supporting, british, rule, contrivers, and, authors, of, seditious, publications, critical, of, the, revolutionary, cause, most, quakers, remained, neutral, although, a, sizeable, number, nevertheless, participated, to, some, degree, women, contributed, to, the, american, revolution, in, many, ways, and, were, involved, on, both, sides, formal, politics, did, not, include, women, but, ordinary, domestic, behaviors, became, charged, with, political, significance, as, patriot, women, confronted, a, war, which, permeated, all, aspects, of, political, civil, and, domestic, life, they, participated, by, boycotting, british, goods, spying, on, the, british, following, armies, as, they, marched, washing, cooking, and, mending, for, soldiers, delivering, secret, messages, and, even, fighting, disguised, as, men, in, a, few, cases, such, as, deborah, samson, mercy, otis, warren, held, meetings, in, her, house, and, cleverly, attacked, loyalists, with, her, creative, plays, and, histories, many, women, also, acted, as, nurses, and, helpers, tending, to, the, soldiers, wounds, and, buying, and, selling, goods, for, them, some, of, these, camp, followers, even, participated, in, combat, such, as, madam, john, turchin, who, led, her, husband, s, regiment, into, battle, above, all, women, continued, the, agricultural, work, at, home, to, feed, their, families, and, the, armies, they, maintained, their, families, during, their, husbands, absences, and, sometimes, after, their, deaths, american, women, were, integral, to, the, success, of, the, boycott, of, british, goods, as, the, boycotted, items, were, largely, household, articles, such, as, tea, and, cloth, women, had, to, return, to, knitting, goods, and, to, spinning, and, weaving, their, own, cloth, skills, that, had, fallen, into, disuse, in, 1769, the, women, of, boston, produced, 40, 000, skeins, of, yarn, and, 180, women, in, middletown, massachusetts, wove, 20, 522, yards, 18, 765, m, of, cloth, many, women, gathered, food, money, clothes, and, other, supplies, during, the, war, to, help, the, soldiers, a, woman, s, loyalty, to, her, husband, could, become, an, open, political, act, especially, for, women, in, america, committed, to, men, who, remained, loyal, to, the, king, legal, divorce, usually, rare, was, granted, to, patriot, women, whose, husbands, supported, the, king, in, early, 1776, france, set, up, a, major, program, of, aid, to, the, americans, and, the, spanish, secretly, added, funds, each, country, spent, one, million, livres, tournaises, to, buy, munitions, a, dummy, corporation, run, by, pierre, beaumarchais,

expenditures, and, a, weak, taxation, system, pushed, france, toward, bankruptcy, in, 1777, charles, fran, ois, adrien, le, paulmier, chevalier, d, annemours, acting, as, a, secret, agent, for, france, made, sure, general, george, washington, was, privy, to, his, mission, he, followed, congress, around, for, the, next, two, years, reporting, what, he, observed, back, to, france, the, treaty, of, alliance, between, the, french, and, the, americans, followed, in, 1778, which, led, to, more, french, money, mat, riel, and, troops, being, sent, to, the, united, states, spain, did, not, officially, recognize, the, united, states, but, it, was, a, french, ally, and, it, separately, declared, war, on, britain, on, june, 21, 1779, bernardo, de, g, lvez, general, of, the, spanish, forces, in, new, spain, also, served, as, governor, of, louisiana, he, led, an, expedition, of, colonial, troops, to, capture, florida, from, the, british, and, to, keep, open, a, vital, conduit, for, supplies, going, to, the, americans, ethnic, germans, served, on, both, sides, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, as, george, iii, was, also, the, elector, of, hanover, many, supported, the, loyalist, cause, and, served, as, allies, of, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, most, notably, rented, auxiliary, troops, from, german, states, such, as, the, landgraviate, of, hessen, kassel, american, patriots, tended, to, represent, such, troops, as, mercenaries, in, propaganda, against, the, british, crown, even, american, historians, followed, suit, in, spite, of, colonial, era, jurists, drawing, a, distinction, between, auxiliaries, and, mercenaries, with, auxiliaries, serving, their, prince, when, sent, to, the, aid, of, another, prince, and, mercenaries, serving, a, foreign, prince, as, individuals, by, this, distinction, the, troops, which, served, in, the, american, revolution, were, auxiliaries, other, german, individuals, came, to, assist, the, american, revolutionaries, most, notably, friedrich, wilhelm, von, steuben, who, served, as, a, general, in, the, continental, army, and, is, credited, with, professionalizing, that, force, but, most, germans, who, served, were, already, colonists, von, steuben, s, native, prussia, joined, the, league, of, armed, neutrality, and, king, frederick, ii, of, prussia, was, well, appreciated, in, the, united, states, for, his, support, early, in, the, war, he, expressed, interest, in, opening, trade, with, the, united, states, and, bypassing, english, ports, and, allowed, an, american, agent, to, buy, arms, in, prussia, frederick, predicted, american, success, and, promised, to, recognize, the, united, states, and, american, diplomats, once, france, did, the, same, prussia, also, interfered, in, the, recruiting, efforts, of, russia, and, neighboring, german, states, when, they, raised, armies, to, send, to, the, americas, and, frederick, ii, forbade, enlistment, for, the, american, war, within, prussia, all, prussian, roads, were, denied, to, troops, from, anhalt, zerbst, which, delayed, reinforcements, that, howe, had, hoped, to, receive, during, the, winter, of, 1777, 1778, however, when, the, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, 1778, 1779, erupted, frederick, ii, became, much, more, cautious, with, prussian, british, relations, u, s, ships, were, denied, access, to,

patriots, although, political, factors, were, important, as, well, some, tried, to, remain, neutral, seeing, little, value, in, joining, what, they, perceived, to, be, a, white, man, s, war, and, fearing, reprisals, from, whichever, side, they, opposed, the, great, majority, of, indigenous, people, did, not, participate, directly, in, the, war, with, the, notable, exceptions, of, warriors, and, bands, associated, with, four, of, the, iroquois, tribes, in, new, york, and, pennsylvania, which, allied, with, the, british, and, the, oneida, and, tuscarora, tribes, among, the, iroquois, of,

lines, throughout, the, south, causing, dramatic, losses, to, slaveholders, and, disrupting, cultivation, and, harvesting, of, crops, for, instance, south, carolina, was, estimated, to, have, lost, about, 25, 000, slaves, to, flight, migration, or, death, which, amounted, to, a, third, of, its, slave, population, during, the, war, the, british, commanders, attempted, to, weaken, the, patriots, by, issuing, proclamations, of, freedom, to, their, slaves, in, the, november, 1775, document, known, as, dunmore, s, proclamation, virginia, royal, governor, lord, dunmore, recruited, black, men, into, the, british, forces, with, the, promise, of, freedom, protection, for, their, families, and, land, grants, some, men, responded, and, briefly, formed, the, british, ethiopian, regiment, historian, david, brion, davis, explains, the, difficulties, with, a, policy, of, wholesale, arming, of, the, slaves, but, england, greatly, feared, the, effects, of, any, such, move, on, its, own, west, indies, where, americans, had, already, aroused, alarm, over, a, possible, threat, to, incite, slave, insurrections, the, british, elites, also, understood, that, an, all, out, attack, on, one, form, of, property, could, easily, lead, to, an, assault, on, all, boundaries, of, privilege, and, social, order, as, envisioned, by, radical, religious, sects, in, britain, s, seventeenth, century, civil, wars, davis, underscores, the, british, dilemma, britain, when, confronted, by, the, rebellious, american, colonists, hoped, to, exploit, their, fear, of, slave, revolts, while, also, reassuring, the, large, number, of, slave, holding, loyalists, and, wealthy, caribbean, planters, and, merchants, that, their, slave, property, would, be, secure, the, americans, however, accused, the, british, of, encouraging, slave, revolts, with, the, issue, becoming, one, of, the, 27, colonial, grievances, the, existence, of, slavery, in, the, american, colonies, had, attracted, criticism, from, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, as, many, could, not, reconcile, the, existence, of, the, institution, with, the, egalitarian, ideals, espoused, by, leaders, of, the, revolution, british, writer, samuel, johnson, wrote, how, is, it, we, hear, the, loudest, yelps, for, liberty, among, the, drivers, of, the, negroes, in, a, text, opposing, the, grievances, of, the, colonists, referring, to, this, contradiction, english, abolitionist, thomas, day, wrote, in, a, 1776, letter, that, if, there, be, an, object, truly, ridiculous, in, nature, it, is, an, american, patriot, signing, resolutions, of, independency, with, the, one, hand, and, with, the, other, brandishing, a, whip, over, his, affrighted, slaves, thomas, jefferson, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, include, a, section, in, the, declaration, of, independence, which, asserted, that, king, george, iii, had, forced, the, slave, trade, onto, the, colonies, despite, the, turmoil, of, the, period, african, americans, contributed, to, the, foundation, of, an, american, national, identity, during, the, revolution, phyllis, wheatley, an, african, american, poet, popularized, the, image, of, columbia, to, represent, america, the, 1779, philipsburg, proclamation, expanded, the, promise, of, freedom, for, black, men, who, enlisted, in, the, british, military, to, all, the, colonies, in, rebellion, british, forces, gave, transportation, to, 10, 000, slaves, when, they, evacuated, savannah, and, charleston, carrying, through, on, their, promise, they, evacuated, and, resettled, more, than, 3, 000, black, loyalists, from, new, york, to, nova, scotia, upper, canada, and, lower, canada, others, sailed, with, the, british, to, england, or, were, resettled, as, freedmen, in, the, west, indies, of, the, caribbean, but, slaves, carried, to, the, caribbean, under, control, of, loyalist, masters, generally, remained, slaves, until, british, abolition, of, slavery, in, its, colonies, in, 1833, 1838, more, than, 1, 200, of, the, black, loyalists, of, nova, scotia, later, resettled, in, the, british, colony, of, sierra, leone, where, they, became, leaders, of, the, krio, ethnic, group, of, freetown, and, the, later, national, government, many, of, their, descendants, still, live, in, sierra, leone, as, well, as, other, african, countries, after, the, revolution, genuinely, democratic, politics, became, possible, in, the, former, american, colonies, the, rights, of, the, people, were, incorporated, into, state, constitutions, concepts, of, liberty, individual, rights, equality, among, men, and, hostility, toward, corruption, became, incorporated, as, core, values, of, liberal, republicanism, the, greatest, challenge, to, the, old, order, in, europe, was, the, challenge, to, inherited, political, power, and, the, democratic, idea, that, government, rests, on, the, consent, of, the, governed, the, example, of, the, first, successful, revolution, against, a, european, empire, and, the, first, successful, establishment, of, a, republican, form, of, democratically, elected, government, provided, a, model, for, many, other, colonial, peoples, who, realized, that, they, too, could, break, away, and, become, self, governing, nations, with, directly, elected, representative, government, interpretations, vary, concerning, the, effect, of, the, revolution, historians, such, as, bernard, bailyn, gordon, wood, and, edmund, morgan, view, it, as, a, unique, and, radical, event, which, produced, deep, changes, and, had, a, profound, effect, on, world, affairs, such, as, an, increasing, belief, in, the, principles, of, the, enlightenment, these, were, demonstrated, by, a, leadership, and, government, that, espoused, protection, of, natural, rights, and, a, system, of, laws, chosen, by, the, people, john, murrin, by, contrast, argues, that, the, definition, of, the, people, at, that, time, was, mostly, restricted, to, free, men, who, passed, a, property, qualification, gordon, wood, states, edmund, morgan, has, argued, that, in, terms, of, long, term, impact, on, american, society, and, values, the, first, shot, of, the, american, revolution, at, the, battle, of, lexington, and, concord, is, referred, to, as, the, shot, heard, round, the, world, due, to, its, historical, and, global, significance, the, revolutionary, war, victory, not, only, established, the, united, states, as, the, first, modern, constitutional, republic, but, marked, the, transition, from, an, age, of, monarchy, to, a, new, age, of, freedom, by, inspiring, similar, movements, worldwide, the, american, revolution, was, the, first, of, the, atlantic, revolutions, followed, most, notably, by, the, french, revolution, the, haitian, revolution, and, the, latin, american, wars, of, independence, aftershocks, contributed, to, rebellions, in, ireland, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, and, the, netherlands, the, u, s, constitution, drafted, shortly, after, independence, remains, the, world, s, oldest, written, constitution, and, has, been, emulated, by, other, countries, in, some, cases, verbatim, some, historians, and, scholars, argue, that, the, subsequent, wave, of, independence, and, revolutionary, movements, has, contributed, to, the, continued, expansion, of, democratic, government, 144, countries, representing, two, third, of, the, world, s, population, are, full, or, partially, democracies, of, same, form, the, dutch, republic, also, at, war, with, britain, was, the, next, country, after, france, to, sign, a, treaty, with, the, united, states, on, october, 8, 1782, on, april, 3, 1783, ambassador, extraordinary, gustaf, philip, creutz, representing, king, gustav, iii, of, sweden, and, benjamin, franklin, signed, a, treaty, of, amity, and, commerce, with, the, u, s, the, revolution, had, a, strong, immediate, influence, in, great, britain, ireland, the, netherlands, and, france, many, british, and, irish, whigs, in, parliament, spoke, glowingly, in, favor, of, the, american, cause, in, ireland, the, protestant, minority, who, controlled, ireland, demanded, self, rule, under, the, leadership, of, henry, grattan, the, irish, patriot, party, forced, the, reversal, of, mercantilist, prohibitions, against, trade, with, other, british, colonies, the, king, and, his, cabinet, in, london, could, not, risk, another, rebellion, and, so, made, a, series, of, concessions, to, the, patriot, faction, in, dublin, armed, volunteer, units, of, the, protestant, ascendancy, were, set, up, ostensibly, to, protect, against, an, invasion, from, france, as, had, been, in, colonial, america, so, too, in, ireland, now, the, king, no, longer, had, a, monopoly, of, lethal, force, for, many, europeans, such, as, the, marquis, de, lafayette, who, later, were, active, during, the, era, of, the, french, revolution, the, american, case, along, with, the, dutch, revolt, end, of, the, 16th, century, and, the, 17th, century, english, civil, war, was, among, the, examples, of, overthrowing, an, old, regime, the, american, declaration, of, independence, influenced, the, french, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, of, 1789, the, spirit, of, the, declaration, of, independence, led, to, laws, ending, slavery, in, all, the, northern, states, and, the, northwest, territory, with, new, jersey, the, last, in, 1804, states, such, as, new, jersey, and, new, york, adopted, gradual, emancipation, which, kept, some, people, as, slaves, for, more, than, two, decades, longer, during, the, revolution, the, contradiction, between, the, patriots, professed, ideals, of, liberty, and, the, institution, of, slavery, generated, increased, scrutiny, of, the, latter, 235, 105, 106, 186, as, early, as, 1764, the, boston, patriot, leader, james, otis, jr, declared, that, all, men, white, or, black, were, by, the, law, of, nature, born, free, 237, anti, slavery, calls, became, more, common, in, the, early, 1770s, in, 1773, benjamin, rush, the, future, signer, of, the, declaration, of, independence, called, on, advocates, for, american, liberty, to, oppose, slavery, 239, slavery, became, an, issue, that, had, to, be, addressed, as, historian, christopher, l, brown, put, it, slavery, had, never, been, on, the, agenda, in, a, serious, way, before, but, the, revolution, forced, it, to, be, a, public, question, from, there, forward, in, the, late, 1760s, and, early, 1770s, several, colonies, including, massachusetts, and, virginia, attempted, to, restrict, the, slave, trade, but, were, prevented, from, doing, so, by, royally, appointed, governors, 245, in, 1774, as, part, of, a, broader, non, importation, movement, aimed, at, britain, the, continental, congress, called, on, all, the, colonies, to, ban, the, importation, of, slaves, and, the, colonies, passed, acts, doing, so, 245, in, the, first, two, decades, after, the, american, revolution, state, legislatures, and, individuals, took, actions, to, free, slaves, in, part, based, on, revolutionary, ideals, northern, states, passed, new, constitutions, that, contained, language, about, equal, rights, or, specifically, abolished, slavery, some, states, such, as, new, york, and, new, jersey, where, slavery, was, more, widespread, passed, laws, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, to, abolish, slavery, by, a, gradual, method, by, 1804, all, the, northern, states, had, passed, laws, outlawing, slavery, either, immediately, or, over, time, indentured, servitude, temporary, slavery, which, had, been, widespread, in, the, colonies, half, the, population, of, philadelphia, had, once, been, bonded, servants, dropped, dramatically, and, disappeared, by, 1800, no, southern, state, abolished, slavery, but, for, a, period, individual, owners, could, free, their, slaves, by, personal, decision, numerous, slaveholders, who, freed, their, slaves, cited, revolutionary, ideals, in, their, documents, others, freed, slaves, as, a, reward, for, service, records, also, suggest, that, some, slaveholders, were, freeing, their, own, mixed, race, children, born, into, slavery, to, slave, mothers, the, number, of, free, blacks, as, a, proportion, of, the, black, population, in, the, upper, south, increased, from, less, than, 1, percent, to, nearly, 10, percent, between, 1790, and, 1810, as, a, result, of, these, actions, nevertheless, slavery, continued, in, the, south, where, it, became, a, peculiar, institution, setting, the, stage, for, future, sectional, conflict, between, north, and, south, over, the, issue, 186, 187, thousands, of, free, blacks, in, the, northern, states, fought, in, the, state, militias, and, continental, army, in, the, south, both, sides, offered, freedom, to, slaves, who, would, perform, military, service, roughly, 20, 000, slaves, fought, in, the, american, revolution, the, democratic, ideals, of, the, revolution, inspired, changes, in, the, roles, of, women, the, concept, of, republican, motherhood, was, inspired, by, this, period, and, reflects, the, importance, of, revolutionary, republicanism, as, the, dominant, american, ideology, it, assumed, that, a, successful, republic, rested, upon, the, virtue, of, its, citizens, women, were, considered, to, have, the, essential, role, of, instilling, their, children, with, values, conducive, to, a, healthy, republic, during, this, period, the, wife, s, relationship, with, her, husband, also, became, more, liberal, as, love, and, affection, instead, of, obedience, and, subservience, began, to, characterize, the, ideal, marital, relationship, the, traditional, constraints, gave, way, to, more, liberal, conditions, for, women, young, people, had, more, freedom, to, choose, their, spouses, and, more, often, used, birth, control, to, regulate, the, size, of, their, families, society, emphasized, the, role, of, mothers, in, child, rearing, especially, the, patriotic, goal, of, raising, republican, children, rather, than, those, locked, into, aristocratic, value, systems, there, was, more, permissiveness, in, child, rearing, patriot, women, married, to, loyalists, who, left, the, state, could, get, a, divorce, and, obtain, control, of, the, ex, husband, s, property, whatever, gains, they, had, made, however, women, still, found, themselves, subordinated, legally, and, socially, to, their, husbands, disfranchised, and, usually, with, only, the, role, of, mother, open, to, them, but, some, women, earned, livelihoods, as, midwives, and, in, other, roles, in, the, community, not, originally, recognized, as, significant, by, men, abigail, adams, expressed, to, her, husband, the, president, the, desire, of, women, to, have, a, place, in, the, new, republic, i, desire, you, would, remember, the, ladies, and, be, more, generous, and, favourable, to, them, than, your, ancestors, do, not, put, such, unlimited, power, into, the, hands, of, the, husbands, the, revolution, sparked, a, discussion, on, the, rights, of, woman, and, an, environment, favorable, to, women, s, participation, in, politics, briefly, the, possibilities, for, women, s, rights, were, highly, favorable, but, a, backlash, led, to, a, greater, rigidity, that, excluded, women, from, politics, for, more, than, thirty, years, however, the, 1776, new, jersey, state, constitution, gave, the, vote, to, all, inhabitants, who, had, a, certain, level, of, wealth, including, unmarried, women, and, blacks, not, married, women, because, they, could, not, own, property, separately, from, their, husbands, until, in, 1807, when, that, state, legislature, passed, a, bill, interpreting, the, constitution, to, mean, universal, white, male, suffrage, excluding, paupers, tens, of, thousands, of, loyalists, left, the, united, states, following, the, war, philip, ranlet, estimates, 20, 000, while, maya, jasanoff, estimates, as, many, as, 70, 000, some, migrated, to, britain, but, the, great, majority, received, land, and, subsidies, for, resettlement, in, british, colonies, in, north, america, especially, quebec, concentrating, in, the, eastern, townships, prince, edward, island, and, nova, scotia, britain, created, the, colonies, of, upper, canada, ontario, and, new, brunswick, expressly, for, their, benefit, and, the, crown, awarded, land, to, loyalists, as, compensation, for, losses, in, the, united, states, nevertheless, approximately, eighty, five, percent, of, the, loyalists, stayed, in, the, united, states, as, american, citizens, and, some, of, the, exiles, later, returned, to, the, u, s, patrick, henry, spoke, of, the, issue, of, allowing, loyalists, to, return, as, such, shall, we, who, have, laid, the, proud, british, lion, at, our, feet, be, frightened, of, its, whelps, his, actions, helped, secure, return, of, the, loyalists, to, american, soil, the, american, revolution, has, a, central, place, in, the, american, memory, as, the, story, of, the, nation, s, founding, it, is, covered, in, the, schools, memorialized, by, two, national, holidays, washington, s, birthday, in, february, and, independence, day, in, july,
