1349, polish, king, casimir, iii, the, great, adopted, the, title, of, king, of, poland, and, ruthenia, and, the, territory, was, transformed, into, the, ruthenian, voivodeship, latin, palatinatus, russiae, in, 1434, the, principality, of, volhynia, may, have, emerged, as, early, as, the, late, 10th, century, with, vsevolod, a, son, of, vladimir, i, of, kiev, mentioned, as, a, prince, of, the, city, of, volodymyr, igor, yaroslavich, reportedly, briefly, reigned, as, the, prince, of, volodymyr, in, the, 1050s, iaroslav, sviatopolkovich, r, 1100, 1118, was, the, only, prince, in, kievan, rus, to, oppose, vladimir, ii, monomakh, s, reign, on, the, grounds, of, agnatic, seniority, but, after, vladimir, ousted, him, in, 1118, his, monomakhovichi, descendants, established, a, local, dynastic,

vladimirko, volodarovich, s, unification, of, the, principalities, of, zvenyhorod, peremyshl, and, terebovlia, since, the, 1080s, or, 1090s, all, three, had, been, ruled, by, sons, of, prince, rostislav, of, tmutarakan, who, may, or, may, not, also, have, been, a, prince, in, volhynia, and, galicia, c, 1054, 1060, to, 1067, both, volhynia, and, galicia, had, experienced, a, remarkable, economic, development, in, the, 12th, century, due, to, their, commercial, advantages, in, part, this, was, because, land, trade, routes, in, asia, minor, were, severely, disrupted, due, to, the, byzantine, seljuk, wars, 1046, 1243, diverting, numerous, merchants, coming, from, the, east, heading, for, constantinople, via, alexandria, in, egypt, while, others, circumvented, anatolia, via, the, port, of, sudak, sougdaia, in, crimea, the, flourishing, of, the, latter, commercial, hub, soon, attracted, kievan, rus, traders, who, rerouted, some, of, the, would, be, byzantine, goods, occasionally, through, itinerant, jewish, merchants, to, poland, hungary, bohemia, and, germany, via, the, towns, of, volhynia, and, galicia, their, new, status, as, transit, hubs, for, commerce,

volhynia, merged, around, 1198, or, 1199, into, the, principality, of, galicia, volhynia, this, happened, when, the, local, galician, branch, of, the, rostislavichi, clan, died, out, and, roman, mstislavich, of, volhynia, also, took, possession, of, galicia, establishing, a, dynastic, union, galicia, volhynia, was, created, following, the, death, in, 1198, or, 1199, and, without, a, recognized, heir, in, the, paternal, line, of, the, last, prince, of, galicia, vladimir, ii, yaroslavich, roman, acquired, the, principality, of, galicia, and, united, his, lands, into, one, state, he, did, so, upon, the, invitation, of, the, boyars, of, galician, boyars, who, expected, that, roman, would, be, an, absentee, volhynian, prince, ruling, from, afar, so, that, they, could, increase, their, own, power, on, the, contrary, roman, curbed, their, power, expelled, any, boyar, who, opposed, him, and, increased, the, influence, of, the, urban, and, rural, populace, in, roman, s, time, galicia, volhynia, s, principal, cities, were, halych, and, volodymyr, roman, was, allied, with, poland, signed, a, peace, treaty, with, hungary, and, developed, diplomatic, relations, with, the, byzantine, empire, the, grand, prince, of, kiev, rurik, rostislavich, rurik, ii, forged, a, coalition, of, rus, princes, and, attacked, galicia, volhynia, but, roman, defeated, them, and, captured, kiev, in, 1200, however, because, the, old, capital, of, kievan, rus, was, no, longer, a, strong, power, centre, by, that, time, roman, kept, the, prosperous, halych, as, his, capital, and, appointed, subordinates, to, administer, kiev, in, his, name, he, then, mounted, two, successful, campaigns, against, the, cumans, in, 1201, 2, and, 1203, 4, in, 1203, roman, also, extended, his, rule, to, the, principality, of, pereyaslavl, during, his, absence, rurik, ii, retook, and, heavily, sacked, kiev, in, 1203, with, the, help, of, polovtsians, and, chernihivians, in, 1204, roman, recaptured, kiev,

polish, forces, in, the, battle, of, zawichost, 1205, triggering, a, war, of, succession, while, his, dominion, entered, a, period, of, rebellion, and, chaos, that, lasted, almost, 40, years, in, this, time, the, galician, boyars, made, efforts, to, prevent, the, establishment, of, a, hereditary, princely, dynasty, especially, by, roman, s, son, daniel, and, instead, put, all, sorts, of, puppets, on, the, throne, which, they, could, easily, control, thus, weakened, by, war, between, galician, boyars, and, some, appanage, princes, galicia, volhynia, also, became, an, arena, of, rivalry, between, poland, and, hungary, which, intervened, in, the, region, several, times, roman, s, successors, would, mostly, use, halych, galicia, as, the, designation, of, their, combined, kingdom, king, andrew, ii, of, hungary, styled, himself, rex, galici, et, lodomeri, latin, for, king, of, galicia, and, vladimir, a, title, that, was, later, adopted, by, the, house, of, habsburg,

battle, of, the, kalka, river, 1223, against, the, mongols, but, in, 1228, the, boyars, expelled, him, and, transferred, the, principality, of, galicia, to, the, king, of, hungary, it, was, daniel, of, galicia, son, of, roman, who, formed, a, real, union, of, volhynia, and, galicia, daniel, first, established, himself, in, volhynia, after, failing, to, retake, his, father, s, other, throne, in, 1230, 1232, and, 1233, 1235, daniel, succeeded, upon, his, third, attempt, and, conquered, galicia, in, 1238, reunited, galician, and, volhynia, and, ruled, for, a, quarter, century, in, march, 1238, he, defeated, the, teutonic, knights, of, the, order, of, dobrzy, in, the, battle, of, dorohychyn, daniel, captured, kiev, in, 1239, just, before, the, mongols, besieged, conquered, and, sacked, the, city, in, late, 1240, on, 17, august, 1245, daniel, and, his, brother, vasylko, defeated, the, polish, and, hungarian, forces, weakened, by, the, first, mongol, invasion, of, poland, and, the, first, mongol, invasion, of, hungary, in, early, 1241, in, the, battle, of, yaroslav, jaros, aw, taking, full, control, of, galicia, volhynia, the, brothers, also, crushed, their, ally, rostislav, mikhailovich, son, of, the, prince, of, chernigov, daniel, strengthened, his, relations, with, batu, khan, by, traveling, to, his, capital, sarai, and, acknowledging, at, least, nominally, the, supremacy, of, the, mongol, golden, horde, after, meeting, with, batu, khan, in, 1246, daniel, reorganized, his, army, along, mongol, lines, and, equipped, it, with, mongolian, weapons, although, daniel, himself, maintained, the, traditional, attire, of, a, rus, prince, according, to, vernadsky, 1970, daniel, s, alliance, with, the, mongols, was, merely, tactical, he, pursued, a, long, term, strategy, of, resistance, to, the, mongols, on, the, other, hand, magocsi, 2010, argued, that, daniel, submitted, to, the, mongols, citing, the, galician, volhynian, chronicle, which, decried, daniel, is, now, on, his, knees, and, is, called, a, slave, and, called, this, event, the, greatest, disgrace, magocsi, stated, that, although, he, never, acknowledged, it, daniel, was, a, mongol, vassal, who, collected, the, mongol, tribute, and, generally, helped, establishing, mongol, administrative, control, over, eastern, europe, in, cooperation, with, those, rus, princes, who, could, be, made, to, see, the, advantages, of, the, new, pax, mongolica, according, to, magocsi, daniel, s, submission, to, the, mongols, ensured, the, strength, and, prosperity, of, galicia, volhynia, he, did, renew, his, alliances, with, hungary, poland, and, lithuania, making, plans, to, forge, an, anti, mongol, coalition, with, them, to, wage, a, crusade, against, the, khan, although, these, were, never, carried, out, it, would, eventually, lead, to, daniel, s, royal, coronation, by, papal, legate, in, 1253, this, brought, galicia, volhynia, into, the, orbit, of, the, western, european, feudal, order, and, the, roman, catholic, church, in, 1245, pope, innocent, iv, allowed, daniel, to, be, crowned, king, daniel, wanted, more, than, recognition, commenting, bitterly, that, he, expected, an, army, when, he, received, the, crown, although, daniel, promised, to, promote, recognition, of, the, pope, to, his, people, his, realm, continued, to, be, ecclesiastically, independent, from, rome, thus, daniel, was, the, only, member, of, the, rurik, dynasty, to, have, been, crowned, king, daniel, was, crowned, by, the, papal, legate, opizo, de, mezzano, in, dorohochyn, 1253, as, the, first, king, of, ruthenia, rex, russiae, 1253, 1264, in, 1256, daniel, succeeded, in, driving, the, mongols, out, of, volhynia, and, a, year, later, he, defeated, their, attempts, to, capture, the, cities, of, lutsk, and, volodymyr, upon, the, approach, of, a, large, army, under, the, mongolian, general, boroldai, in, 1260, however, daniel, was, forced, to, accept, their, authority, and, to, raze, the, fortifications, he, had, built, against, them, under, daniel, s, reign, the, kingdom, of, galicia, volhynia, was, one, of, the, most, powerful, states, in, east, central, europe, and, it, has, been, described, as, a, golden, age, for, galicia, volhynia, literature, flourished, producing, the, galician, volhynian, chronicle, demographic, growth, was, enhanced, by, immigration, from, the, west, and, the, south, including, germans, and, armenians, commerce, developed, due, to, trade, routes, linking, the, black, sea, with, poland, germany, and, the, baltic, basin, major, cities, which, served, as, important, economic, and, cultural, centers, included, lviv, where, the, royal, seat, would, later, be, moved, by, daniel, s, son, volodymyr, halych, kholm, daniel, s, capital, peremyshl, dorohychyn, and, terebovlya, galicia, volhynia, was, important, enough, that, in, 1252, daniel, was, able, to, marry, his, son, roman, to, gertrude, of, babenberg, heiress, of, the, duchy, of, austria, in, the, vain, hope, of, securing, the, latter, for, his, family, another, son, shvarn, married, a, daughter, of, mindaugas, lithuania, s, first, king, and, briefly, ruled, that, land, from, 1267, to, 1269, at, the, peak, of, its, expansion, the, galician, volhynian, state, contained, not, only, south, western, rus, lands, including, red, ruthenia, and, black, ruthenia, but, also,

a, time, maintained, the, strength, of, the, kingdom, of, galicia, volhynia, unlike, his, father, who, pursued, a, western, political, course, leo, worked, closely, with, the, mongols, in, particular, cultivating, a, close, alliance, with, the, tatar, khan, nogai, together, with, his, mongol, allies, he, invaded, poland, however, although, his, troops, plundered, territory, as, far, west, as, racib, rz, sending, many, captives, and, much, booty, back, to, galicia, leo, did, not, ultimately, gain, much, territory, from, poland, leo, also, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, establish, his, family, s, rule, over, lithuania, soon, after, his, brother, shvarn, ascended, to, the, lithuanian, throne, in, 1267, he, had, the, former, lithuanian, ruler, vai, vilkas, killed, following, shvarn, s, loss, of, the, throne, in, 1269, leo, entered, into, conflict, with, lithuania, from, 1274, to, 1276, he, fought, a, war, with, the, new, lithuanian, ruler, traidenis, but, was, defeated, and, lithuania, annexed, the, territory, of, black, ruthenia, with, its, city, navahrudak, in, 1279, leo, allied, himself, with, king, wenceslaus, ii, of, bohemia, and, invaded, poland, although, his, attempt, to, capture, krak, w, in, 1280, ended, in, failure, that, same, year, leo, defeated, hungary, and, annexed, part, of, transcarpathia, including, the, city, of, mukachevo, in, 1292, he, defeated, fragmented, poland, and, added, lublin, with, surrounding, areas, to, the, territory, of, his, kingdom, after, leo, s, death, in, 1301, a, period, of, decline, ensued, leo, was, succeeded, by, his, son, yuri, i, who, ruled, for, only, seven, years, although, his, reign, was, largely, peaceful, and, the, galicia, volhynia, flourished, economically, yuri, i, lost, lublin, to, the, poles, in, 1302, from, 1308, to, 1323, galicia, volhynia, was, jointly, ruled, by, yuri, i, s, sons, andrew, and, leo, ii, who, proclaimed, themselves, to, be, the, kings, of, galicia, volhynia, the, brothers, forged, alliances, with, king, w, adys, aw, i, of, poland, and, the, teutonic, order, against, the, lithuanians, and, the, mongols, but, the, kingdom, was, still, tributary, to, the, mongols, and, joined, the, mongol, military, expeditions, of, uzbeg, khan, and, his, successor, janibeg, khan, the, brothers, died, together, in, 1323, in, battle, fighting, against, the, mongols, and, left, no, heirs, after, the, extinction, of, the, rurikid, dynasty, in, galicia, volhynia, in, 1323, volhynia, passed, into, the, control, of, the, lithuanian, prince, liubartas, while, the,

assumed, the, name, yuri, ii, his, encouragement, of, foreign, colonization, led, to, conflicts, with, the, boyars, who, then, poisoned, him, in, 1340, and, offered, the, throne, to, liubartas, within, the, same, year, casimir, iii, of, poland, attacked, lviv, in, winter, 1341, tatars, ruthenians, led, by, detko, and, lithuanians, led, by, liubartas, were, able, to, defeat, the, poles,

a, successful, invasion, capturing, and, annexing, galicia, in, 1349, the, romanovichi, branch, of, the, rurikid, dynasty, of, daniel, of, galicia, attempted, to, gain, support, from, pope, benedict, xii, and, broader, european, powers, for, an, alliance, against, the, mongols, but, ultimately, proved, unable, to, compete, with, the, rising, powers, of, the, centralised, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, the, kingdom, of, poland, only, in, 1349, after, the, occupation, of, galicia, volhynia, by, an, allied, polish, hungarian, force, was, galicia, volhynia, finally, conquered, and, incorporated, into, poland, this, ended, the, vassalage, of, galicia, volhynia, to, the, golden, horde, from, 1340, to, 1392, the, civil, war, in, the, region, transitioned, into, a, power, struggle, between, lithuania, poland, and, hungary, the, first, stage, of, conflict, led, to, the, signing, of, a, treaty, in, 1344, that, secured, the, principality, of, peremyshl, for, the, crown, of, poland, while, the, rest, of, the, territory, belonged, to, a, member, of, the, gediminid, dynasty, of, liubartas, eventually, by, the, mid, 14th, century, the, kingdom, of, poland, and, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, divided, up, the, region, between, them, king, casimir, iii, took, galicia, and, western, volhynia, while, the, sister, state, of, eastern, volhynia, together, with, kiev, came, under,
