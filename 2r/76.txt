a, cradle, of, civilization, is, a, location, and, a, culture, where, civilization, was, developed, independent, of, other, civilizations, in, other, locations, a, civilization, is, any, complex, society, characterized, by, the, development, of, the, state, social, stratification, urbanization, and, symbolic, systems, of, communication, beyond, signed, or, spoken, languages, namely, writing, systems, and, graphic, arts, scholars, generally, acknowledge, seven, cradles, of, civilization, mesopotamia, egypt, india, china, and, iran, are, believed, to, be, the, earliest, in, afro, eurasia, previously, called, the, old, world, while, in, the, americas, previously, called, the, new, world, the, caral, supe, civilization, of, ancient, peru, is, believed, to, be, the, earliest, in, south, america, and, the, olmec, civilization, of, ancient, mexico, is, believed, to, be, the, earliest, in, north, america, all, of, the, cradles, of, civilization, depended, upon, agriculture, for, sustenance, except, for, possibly, the, caral, supe, civilization, which, may, have, depended, initially, on, marine, resources, all, depended, upon, farmers, producing, an, agricultural, surplus, to, support, the, centralized, government, political, leaders, religious, leaders, and, public, works, of, the, urban, centres, of, the, early, civilizations, less, formally, a, derived, form, of, the, term, cradle, of, civilization, is, often, used, to, refer, to, specific, ancient, civilizations, when, they, are, seen, as, the, backbone, for, a, modern, society, s, history, a, prominent, example, of, such, usage, is, with, regard, to, greece, or, rome, both, of, which, have, been, called, the, cradle, of, western, civilization, for, their, social, political, and, cultural, influence, which, culminated, in, the, establishment, of, the, roman, empire, the, earliest, signs, of, a, process, leading, to, sedentary, culture, can, be, seen, in, the, levant, to, as, early, as, 12, 000, bc, when, the, natufian, culture, became, sedentary, it, evolved, into, an, agricultural, society, by, 10, 000, bc, the, importance, of, water, to, safeguard, an, abundant, and, stable, food, supply, due, to, favourable, conditions, for, hunting, fishing, and, gathering, resources, including, cereals, provided, an, initial, wide, spectrum, economy, that, triggered, the, creation, of, permanent, villages, the, earliest, proto, urban, settlements, with, several, thousand, inhabitants, emerged, in, the, neolithic, which, began, in, western, asia, in, 10, 000, bc, the, first, cities, to, house, several, tens, of, thousands, were, uruk, ur, kish, and, eridu, in, mesopotamia, followed, by, susa, in, elam, and, memphis, in, egypt, all, by, the, 31st, century, bc, see, historical, urban, community, sizes, historic, times, are, marked, apart, from, prehistoric, times, when, records, of, the, past, begin, to, be, kept, for, the, benefit, of, future, generations, in, written, or, oral, form, if, the, rise, of, civilization, is, taken, to, coincide, with, the, development, of, writing, out, of, proto, writing, then, the, near, eastern, chalcolithic, the, transitional, period, between, the, neolithic, and, the, bronze, age, during, the, 4th, millennium, bc, and, the, development, of, proto, writing, in, harappa, in, the, indus, valley, of, south, asia, around, 3, 300, bc, are, the, earliest, instances, followed, by, chinese, proto, writing, evolving, into, the, oracle, bone, script, and, again, by, the, emergence, of, mesoamerican, writing, systems, from, about, 900, bc, in, the, absence, of, written, documents, most, aspects, of, the, rise, of, early, civilizations, are, contained, in, archaeological, assessments, that, document, the, development, of, formal, institutions, and, the, material, culture, a, civilized, way, of, life, is, ultimately, linked, to, conditions, coming, almost, exclusively, from, intensive, agriculture, gordon, childe, defined, the, development, of, civilization, as, the, result, of, two, successive, revolutions, the, neolithic, revolution, of, western, asia, triggering, the, development, of, settled, communities, and, the, urban, revolution, which, also, first, emerged, in, western, asia, which, enhanced, tendencies, towards, dense, settlements, specialized, occupational, groups, social, classes, exploitation, of, surpluses, monumental, public, buildings, and, writing, few, of, those, conditions, however, are, unchallenged, by, the, records, dense, cities, were, not, attested, in, egypt, s, old, kingdom, unlike, mesopotamia, and, cities, had, a, dispersed, population, in, the, maya, area, the, incas, lacked, writing, although, they, could, keep, records, with, quipus, which, might, also, have, had, literary, uses, and, often, monumental, architecture, preceded, any, indication, of, village, settlement, for, instance, in, present, day, louisiana, researchers, have, determined, that, cultures, that, were, primarily, nomadic, organized, over, generations, to, build, earthwork, mounds, at, seasonal, settlements, as, early, as, 3400, bc, rather, than, a, succession, of, events, and, preconditions, the, rise, of, civilization, could, equally, be, hypothesized, as, an, accelerated, process, that, started, with, incipient, agriculture, and, culminated, in, the, oriental, bronze, age, scholars, once, thought, that, civilization, began, in, the, fertile, crescent, and, spread, out, from, there, by, influence, scholars, now, believe, that, civilizations, arose, independently, at, several, locations, in, both, hemispheres, they, have, observed, that, sociocultural, developments, occurred, along, different, timeframes, sedentary, and, nomadic, communities, continued, to, interact, considerably, they, were, not, strictly, divided, among, widely, different, cultural, groups, the, concept, of, a, cradle, of, civilization, has, a, focus, where, the, inhabitants, came, to, build, cities, to, create, writing, systems, to, experiment, in, techniques, for, making, pottery, and, using, metals, to, domesticate, animals, and, to, develop, complex, social, structures, involving, class, systems, today, scholarship, identifies, seven, areas, where, civilization, emerged, independently, the, fertile, crescent, including, mesopotamia, and, the, levant, the, nile, valley, the, indo, gangetic, plain, the, north, china, plain, the, andean, coast, the, mesoamerican, gulf, coast, the, carpathian, mountains, the, fertile, crescent, comprises, a, crescent, shaped, region, of, elevated, terrain, in, west, asia, encompassing, regions, of, modern, day, egypt, israel, the, palestinian, territories, lebanon, syria, jordan, turkey, and, iraq, extending, to, the, zagros, mountains, in, iran, it, stands, as, one, of, the, earliest, regions, globally, where, agricultural, practices, emerged, marking, the, advent, of, sedentary, farming, communities, by, 10, 200, bc, fully, developed, neolithic, cultures, characterized, by, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, a, ppna, and, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, 7600, 6000, bc, phases, emerged, within, the, fertile, crescent, these, cultures, diffused, eastward, into, south, asia, and, westward, into, europe, and, north, africa, among, the, notable, ppna, settlements, is, jericho, located, in, the, jordan, valley, believed, to, be, the, world, s, earliest, established, city, with, initial, settlement, dating, back, to, around, 9600, bc, and, fortification, occurring, around, 6800, bc, current, theories, and, findings, identify, the, fertile, crescent, as, the, first, and, oldest, cradle, of, civilization, examples, of, sites, in, this, area, are, the, early, neolithic, site, of, g, bekli, tepe, 9500, 8000, bc, and, atalh, y, k, 7500, 5700, bc, in, mesopotamia, a, region, encompassing, modern, iraq, and, bordering, regions, of, southeast, turkey, northeast, syria, and, northwest, iran, the, convergence, of, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, produced, rich, fertile, soil, and, a, supply, of, water, for, irrigation, neolithic, cultures, emerged, in, the, region, from, 8000, bc, onwards, the, civilizations, that, emerged, around, these, rivers, are, the, earliest, known, non, nomadic, agrarian, societies, it, is, because, of, this, that, the, fertile, crescent, region, and, mesopotamia, in, particular, are, often, referred, to, as, the, cradle, of, civilization, the, period, known, as, the, ubaid, period, c, 6500, 3800, bc, is, the, earliest, known, period, on, the, alluvial, plain, although, it, is, likely, earlier, periods, exist, obscured, under, the, alluvium, it, was, during, the, ubaid, period, that, the, movement, toward, urbanization, began, agriculture, and, animal, husbandry, were, widely, practiced, in, sedentary, communities, particularly, in, northern, mesopotamia, later, assyria, and, intensive, irrigated, hydraulic, agriculture, began, to, be, practiced, in, the, south, around, 6000, bc, neolithic, settlements, began, to, appear, all, over, egypt, studies, based, on, morphological, genetic, and, archaeological, data, have, attributed, these, settlements, to, migrants, from, the, fertile, crescent, in, the, near, east, arriving, in, egypt, and, north, africa, during, the, egyptian, and, north, african, neolithic, revolution, and, bringing, agriculture, to, the, region, tell, el, oueili, is, the, oldest, sumerian, site, settled, during, this, period, around, 5400, bc, and, the, city, of, ur, also, first, dates, to, the, end, of, this, period, in, the, south, the, ubaid, period, lasted, from, around, 6500, to, 3800, bc, sumerian, civilization, coalesced, in, the, subsequent, uruk, period, 4000, 3100, bc, named, after, the, sumerian, city, of, uruk, this, period, saw, the, emergence, of, urban, life, in, mesopotamia, and, during, its, later, phase, the, gradual, emergence, of, the, cuneiform, script, proto, writing, in, the, region, dates, to, around, 3800, bc, with, the, earliest, texts, dating, to, 3300, bc, early, cuneiform, writing, emerged, in, 3000, bc, it, was, also, during, this, period, that, pottery, painting, declined, as, copper, started, to, become, popular, along, with, cylinder, seals, sumerian, cities, during, the, uruk, period, were, probably, theocratic, and, were, most, likely, headed, by, a, priest, king, ensi, assisted, by, a, council, of, elders, including, both, men, and, women, it, is, quite, possible, that, the, later, sumerian, pantheon, was, modeled, upon, this, political, structure, the, jemdet, nasr, period, which, is, generally, dated, from, 3100, to, 2900, bc, and, succeeds, the, uruk, period, is, known, as, one, of, the, formative, stages, in, the, development, of, the, cuneiform, script, the, oldest, clay, tablets, come, from, uruk, and, date, to, the, late, fourth, millennium, bc, slightly, earlier, than, the, jemdet, nasr, period, by, the, time, of, the, jemdet, nasr, period, the, script, had, already, undergone, a, number, of, significant, changes, it, originally, consisted, of, pictographs, but, by, the, time, of, the, jemdet, nasr, period, it, was, already, adopting, simpler, and, more, abstract, designs, it, is, also, during, this, period, that, the, script, acquired, its, iconic, wedge, shaped, appearance, uruk, trade, networks, started, to, expand, to, other, parts, of, mesopotamia, and, as, far, as, north, caucasus, and, strong, signs, of, governmental, organization, and, social, stratification, began, to, emerge, leading, to, the, early, dynastic, period, c, 2900, bc, after, the, early, dynastic, period, began, there, was, a, shift, in, control, of, the, city, states, from, the, temple, establishment, headed, by, council, of, elders, led, by, a, priestly, en, a, male, figure, when, it, was, a, temple, for, a, goddess, or, a, female, figure, when, headed, by, a, male, god, towards, a, more, secular, lugal, lu, man, gal, great, the, lugals, included, such, legendary, patriarchal, figures, as, enmerkar, lugalbanda, and, gilgamesh, who, supposedly, reigned, shortly, before, the, historic, record, opens, around, 2700, bc, when, syllabic, writing, started, to, develop, from, the, early, pictograms, the, center, of, sumerian, culture, remained, in, southern, mesopotamia, even, though, rulers, soon, began, expanding, into, neighboring, areas, neighboring, semitic, groups, including, the, akkadian, speaking, semites, assyrians, babylonians, who, lived, alongside, the, sumerians, in, mesopotamia, adopted, much, of, sumerian, culture, for, their, own, the, earliest, ziggurats, began, near, the, end, of, the, early, dynastic, period, although, architectural, precursors, in, the, form, of, raised, platforms, date, back, to, the, ubaid, period, the, sumerian, king, list, dates, to, the, early, second, millennium, bc, it, consists, of, a, succession, of, royal, dynasties, from, different, sumerian, cities, ranging, back, into, the, early, dynastic, period, each, dynasty, rises, to, prominence, and, dominates, the, region, only, to, be, replaced, by, the, next, the, document, was, used, by, later, mesopotamian, kings, to, legitimize, their, rule, while, some, of, the, information, in, the, list, can, be, checked, against, other, texts, such, as, economic, documents, much, of, it, is, probably, purely, fictional, and, its, use, as, a, historical, document, is, limited, eannatum, the, sumerian, king, of, lagash, established, the, first, verifiable, empire, in, history, in, 2500, bc, the, neighboring, elam, in, modern, iran, was, also, part, of, the, early, urbanization, during, the, chalcolithic, period, elamite, states, were, among, the, leading, political, forces, of, the, ancient, near, east, the, emergence, of, elamite, written, records, from, around, 3000, bc, also, parallels, sumerian, history, where, slightly, earlier, records, have, been, found, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, there, developed, a, very, intimate, cultural, symbiosis, between, the, sumerians, and, the, akkadians, akkadian, gradually, replaced, sumerian, as, a, spoken, language, somewhere, between, the, 3rd, and, the, 2nd, millennia, bc, the, semitic, speaking, akkadian, empire, emerged, around, 2350, bc, under, sargon, the, great, the, akkadian, empire, reached, its, political, peak, between, the, 24th, and, 22nd, centuries, bc, under, sargon, and, his, successors, the, akkadian, language, was, briefly, imposed, on, neighboring, conquered, states, such, as, elam, and, gutium, after, the, fall, of, the, akkadian, empire, and, the, overthrow, of, the, gutians, there, was, a, brief, reassertion, of, sumerian, dominance, in, mesopotamia, under, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, after, the, final, collapse, of, sumerian, hegemony, in, mesopotamia, around, 2004, bc, the, semitic, akkadian, people, of, mesopotamia, eventually, coalesced, into, two, major, akkadian, speaking, nations, assyria, in, the, north, whose, earliest, kings, date, to, the, 25th, century, bc, and, a, few, centuries, later, babylonia, in, the, south, both, of, which, assyria, in, particular, would, go, on, to, form, powerful, empires, between, the, 20th, and, 6th, centuries, bc, the, sumerians, were, eventually, absorbed, into, the, semitic, assyrian, babylonian, population, the, developed, neolithic, cultures, belonging, to, the, phases, pre, pottery, neolithic, a, 10, 200, bc, and, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, 7600, 6000, bc, appeared, in, the, fertile, crescent, and, from, there, spread, eastwards, and, westwards, contemporaneously, a, grain, grinding, culture, using, the, earliest, type, of, sickle, blades, had, replaced, the, culture, of, hunters, fishers, and, gathering, people, using, stone, tools, along, the, nile, geological, evidence, and, computer, climate, modeling, studies, also, suggest, that, natural, climate, changes, around, 8000, bc, began, to, desiccate, the, extensive, pastoral, lands, of, northern, africa, eventually, forming, the, sahara, continued, desiccation, forced, the, early, ancestors, of, the, egyptians, to, settle, around, the, nile, more, permanently, and, to, adopt, a, more, sedentary, lifestyle, the, oldest, fully, developed, neolithic, culture, in, egypt, is, fayum, a, culture, that, began, around, 5500, bc, by, about, 5500, bc, small, tribes, living, in, the, nile, valley, had, developed, into, a, series, of, inter, related, cultures, as, far, south, as, sudan, demonstrating, firm, control, of, agriculture, and, animal, husbandry, and, identifiable, by, their, pottery, and, personal, items, such, as, combs, bracelets, and, beads, the, largest, of, these, early, cultures, in, northern, upper, egypt, was, the, badari, which, probably, originated, in, the, western, desert, it, was, known, for, its, high, quality, ceramics, stone, tools, and, use, of, copper, the, oldest, known, domesticated, bovine, in, africa, are, from, fayum, dating, to, around, 4400, bc, the, badari, cultures, was, followed, by, the, naqada, culture, which, brought, a, number, of, technological, improvements, as, early, as, the, first, naqada, period, amratia, egyptians, imported, obsidian, from, ethiopia, used, to, shape, blades, and, other, objects, from, flakes, by, 3300, bc, just, before, the, first, egyptian, dynasty, egypt, was, divided, into, two, kingdoms, known, as, upper, egypt, to, the, south, and, lower, egypt, to, the, north, egyptian, civilization, begins, during, the, second, phase, of, the, naqada, culture, known, as, the, gerzeh, period, around, 3500, bc, and, coalesces, with, the, unification, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, around, 3150, bc, farming, produced, the, vast, majority, of, food, with, increased, food, supplies, the, populace, adopted, a, much, more, sedentary, lifestyle, and, the, larger, settlements, grew, to, cities, of, about, 5, 000, residents, it, was, in, this, time, that, the, city, dwellers, started, using, mud, brick, to, build, their, cities, and, the, use, of, the, arch, and, recessed, walls, for, decorative, effect, became, popular, copper, instead, of, stone, was, increasingly, used, to, make, tools, and, weaponry, symbols, on, gerzean, pottery, also, resemble, nascent, egyptian, hieroglyphs, early, evidence, also, exists, of, contact, with, the, near, east, particularly, canaan, and, the, byblos, coast, during, this, time, concurrent, with, these, cultural, advances, a, process, of, unification, of, the, societies, and, towns, of, the, upper, nile, river, or, upper, egypt, occurred, at, the, same, time, the, societies, of, the, nile, delta, or, lower, egypt, also, underwent, a, unification, process, during, his, reign, in, upper, egypt, king, narmer, defeated, his, enemies, on, the, delta, and, merged, both, the, kingdom, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, under, his, single, rule, the, early, dynastic, period, of, egypt, immediately, followed, the, unification, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, it, is, generally, taken, to, include, the, first, and, second, dynasties, lasting, from, the, naqada, iii, archaeological, period, until, about, the, beginning, of, the, old, kingdom, c, 2686, bc, with, the, first, dynasty, the, capital, moved, from, thinis, to, memphis, with, a, unified, egypt, ruled, by, a, god, king, the, hallmarks, of, ancient, egyptian, civilization, such, as, art, architecture, and, many, aspects, of, religion, took, shape, during, the, early, dynastic, period, the, strong, institution, of, kingship, developed, by, the, pharaohs, served, to, legitimize, state, control, over, the, land, labor, and, resources, that, were, essential, to, the, survival, and, growth, of, ancient, egyptian, civilization, major, advances, in, architecture, art, and, technology, were, made, during, the, subsequent, old, kingdom, fueled, by, the, increased, agricultural, productivity, and, resulting, population, made, possible, by, a, well, developed, central, administration, some, of, ancient, egypt, s, crowning, achievements, the, giza, pyramids, and, great, sphinx, were, constructed, during, the, old, kingdom, under, the, direction, of, the, vizier, state, officials, collected, taxes, coordinated, irrigation, projects, to, improve, crop, yield, drafted, peasants, to, work, on, construction, projects, and, established, a, justice, system, to, maintain, peace, and, order, along, with, the, rising, importance, of, a, central, administration, there, arose, a, new, class, of, educated, scribes, and, officials, who, were, granted, estates, by, the, pharaoh, in, payment, for, their, services, pharaohs, also, made, land, grants, to, their, mortuary, cults, and, local, temples, to, ensure, that, these, institutions, had, the, resources, to, worship, the, pharaoh, after, his, death, scholars, believe, that, five, centuries, of, these, practices, slowly, eroded, the, economic, power, of, the, pharaoh, and, that, the, economy, could, no, longer, afford, to, support, a, large, centralized, administration, as, the, power, of, the, pharaoh, diminished, regional, governors, called, nomarchs, began, to, challenge, the, supremacy, of, the, pharaoh, this, coupled, with, severe, droughts, between, 2200, and, 2150, bc, is, assumed, to, have, caused, the, country, to, enter, the, 140, year, period, of, famine, and, strife, known, as, the, first, intermediate, period, one, of, the, earliest, neolithic, sites, in, the, indian, subcontinent, is, bhirrana, along, the, ancient, ghaggar, hakra, riverine, system, in, the, present, day, state, of, haryana, in, india, dating, to, around, 7600, bc, other, early, sites, include, lahuradewa, in, the, middle, ganges, region, and, jhusi, near, the, confluence, of, ganges, and, yamuna, rivers, both, dating, to, around, 7000, bc, the, aceramic, neolithic, at, mehrgarh, in, present, day, pakistan, lasts, from, 7000, to, 5500, bc, with, the, ceramic, neolithic, at, mehrgarh, lasting, up, to, 3300, bc, blending, into, the, early, bronze, age, mehrgarh, is, one, of, the, earliest, sites, with, evidence, of, farming, and, herding, in, the, indian, subcontinent, it, is, likely, that, the, culture, centered, around, mehrgarh, migrated, into, the, indus, valley, in, present, day, pakistan, and, became, the, indus, valley, civilisation, the, earliest, fortified, town, in, the, region, is, found, at, rehman, dheri, dated, 4000, bc, in, khyber, pakhtunkhwa, close, to, river, zhob, valley, in, present, day, pakistan, other, fortified, towns, found, to, date, are, at, amri, 3600, 3300, bc, kot, diji, in, sindh, and, at, kalibangan, 3000, bc, at, the, hakra, river, the, indus, valley, civilization, starts, around, 3300, bc, with, what, is, referred, to, as, the, early, harappan, phase, 3300, 2600, bc, although, at, the, start, this, was, still, a, village, based, culture, leaving, mostly, pottery, for, archaeologists, the, earliest, examples, of, the, indus, script, date, to, this, period, as, well, as, the, emergence, of, citadels, representing, centralised, authority, and, an, increasingly, urban, quality, of, life, trade, networks, linked, this, culture, with, related, regional, cultures, and, distant, sources, of, raw, materials, including, lapis, lazuli, and, other, materials, for, bead, making, by, around, 2600, bc, villagers, had, domesticated, numerous, crops, including, peas, sesame, seeds, dates, and, cotton, as, well, as, animals, including, the, water, buffalo, 2600, to, 1900, bc, marks, the, mature, harappan, phase, during, which, early, harappan, communities, turned, into, large, urban, centers, including, harappa, dholavira, mohenjo, daro, lothal, rupar, and, rakhigarhi, and, more, than, 1, 000, towns, and, villages, often, of, relatively, small, size, mature, harappans, evolved, new, techniques, in, metallurgy, and, produced, copper, bronze, lead, and, tin, and, displayed, advanced, levels, of, engineering, as, seen, in, harappa, mohenjo, daro, and, the, recently, partially, excavated, rakhigarhi, this, urban, plan, included, the, world, s, first, known, urban, sanitation, systems, see, hydraulic, engineering, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, within, the, city, individual, homes, or, groups, of, homes, obtained, water, from, wells, from, a, room, that, appears, to, have, been, set, aside, for, bathing, waste, water, was, directed, to, covered, drains, which, lined, the, major, streets, houses, opened, only, to, inner, courtyards, and, smaller, lanes, the, housebuilding, in, some, villages, in, the, region, still, resembles, in, some, respects, the, housebuilding, of, the, harappans, the, advanced, architecture, of, the, harappans, is, shown, by, their, impressive, dockyards, granaries, warehouses, brick, platforms, and, protective, walls, the, massive, walls, of, indus, cities, most, likely, protected, the, harappans, from, floods, and, may, have, dissuaded, military, conflicts, the, people, of, the, indus, civilization, achieved, great, accuracy, in, measuring, length, mass, and, time, they, were, among, the, first, to, develop, a, system, of, uniform, weights, and, measures, a, comparison, of, available, objects, indicates, large, scale, variation, across, the, indus, territories, their, smallest, division, which, is, marked, on, an, ivory, scale, found, in, lothal, in, gujarat, was, approximately, 1, 704, mm, the, smallest, division, ever, recorded, on, a, scale, of, the, bronze, age, harappan, engineers, followed, the, decimal, division, of, measurement, for, all, practical, purposes, including, the, measurement, of, mass, as, revealed, by, their, hexahedron, weights, these, chert, weights, were, in, a, ratio, of, 5, 2, 1, with, weights, of, 0, 05, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and, 500, units, with, each, unit, weighing, approximately, 28, grams, similar, to, the, english, imperial, ounce, or, greek, uncia, and, smaller, objects, were, weighed, in, similar, ratios, with, the, units, of, 0, 871, however, as, in, other, cultures, actual, weights, were, not, uniform, throughout, the, area, the, weights, and, measures, later, used, in, kautilya, s, arthashastra, 4th, century, bc, are, the, same, as, those, used, in, lothal, around, 1800, bc, signs, of, a, gradual, decline, began, to, emerge, and, by, around, 1700, bc, most, of, the, cities, had, been, abandoned, suggested, contributory, causes, for, the, localisation, of, the, ivc, include, changes, in, the, course, of, the, river, and, climate, change, that, is, also, signalled, for, the, neighbouring, areas, of, the, middle, east, as, of, 2016, many, scholars, believe, that, drought, led, to, a, decline, in, trade, with, egypt, and, mesopotamia, contributing, to, the, collapse, of, the, indus, civilization, the, ghaggar, hakra, system, was, rain, fed, and, water, supply, depended, on, the, monsoons, the, indus, valley, climate, grew, significantly, cooler, and, drier, from, about, 1800, bc, linked, to, a, general, weakening, of, the, monsoon, at, that, time, the, indian, monsoon, declined, and, aridity, increased, with, the, ghaggar, hakra, retracting, its, reach, towards, the, foothills, of, the, himalaya, leading, to, erratic, and, less, extensive, floods, that, made, inundation, agriculture, less, sustainable, aridification, reduced, the, water, supply, enough, to, cause, the, civilization, s, demise, and, to, scatter, its, population, eastward, as, the, monsoons, kept, shifting, south, the, floods, grew, too, erratic, for, sustainable, agricultural, activities, the, residents, then, migrated, away, into, smaller, communities, however, trade, with, the, old, cities, did, not, flourish, the, small, surplus, produced, in, these, small, communities, did, not, allow, development, of, trade, and, the, cities, died, out, the, indo, aryan, people, migrated, into, the, indus, river, valley, during, this, period, and, began, the, vedic, age, of, india, the, indus, valley, civilization, did, not, disappear, suddenly, and, many, elements, of, the, civilization, continued, in, later, indian, subcontinent, and, vedic, cultures, drawing, on, archaeology, geology, and, anthropology, modern, scholars, do, not, see, the, origins, of, the, chinese, civilization, or, history, as, a, linear, story, but, rather, the, history, of, the, interactions, of, different, and, distinct, cultures, and, ethnic, groups, that, influenced, each, other, s, development, the, specific, cultural, regions, that, developed, chinese, civilization, were, the, yellow, river, civilization, the, yangtze, civilization, and, liao, civilization, early, evidence, for, chinese, millet, agriculture, is, dated, to, around, 7000, bc, with, the, earliest, evidence, of, cultivated, rice, found, at, chengtoushan, near, the, yangtze, river, dated, to, 6500, bc, chengtoushan, may, also, be, the, site, of, the, first, walled, city, in, china, by, the, beginning, of, the, neolithic, revolution, the, yellow, river, valley, began, to, establish, itself, as, a, center, of, the, peiligang, culture, which, flourished, from, 7000, to, 5000, bc, with, evidence, of, agriculture, constructed, buildings, pottery, and, burial, of, the, dead, with, agriculture, came, increased, population, the, ability, to, store, and, redistribute, crops, and, the, potential, to, support, specialist, craftsmen, and, administrators, its, most, prominent, site, is, jiahu, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, jiahu, symbols, 6600, bc, are, the, earliest, form, of, proto, writing, in, china, however, it, is, likely, that, they, should, not, be, understood, as, writing, itself, but, as, features, of, a, lengthy, period, of, sign, use, which, led, eventually, to, a, fully, fledged, system, of, writing, archaeologists, believe, that, the, peiligang, culture, was, egalitarian, with, little, political, organization, it, eventually, evolved, into, the, yangshao, culture, 5000, 3000, bc, and, their, stone, tools, were, polished, and, highly, specialized, they, may, also, have, practiced, an, early, form, of, silkworm, cultivation, the, main, food, of, the, yangshao, people, was, millet, with, some, sites, using, foxtail, millet, and, others, broom, corn, millet, though, some, evidence, of, rice, has, been, found, the, exact, nature, of, yangshao, agriculture, small, scale, slash, and, burn, cultivation, versus, intensive, agriculture, in, permanent, fields, is, currently, a, matter, of, debate, once, the, soil, was, exhausted, residents, picked, up, their, belongings, moved, to, new, lands, and, constructed, new, villages, however, middle, yangshao, settlements, such, as, jiangzhi, contain, raised, floor, buildings, that, may, have, been, used, for, the, storage, of, surplus, grains, grinding, stones, for, making, flour, were, also, found, later, yangshao, culture, was, superseded, by, the, longshan, culture, which, was, also, centered, on, the, yellow, river, from, about, 3000, to, 1900, bc, its, most, prominent, site, being, taosi, the, population, expanded, dramatically, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, with, many, settlements, having, rammed, earth, walls, it, decreased, in, most, areas, around, 2000, bc, until, the, central, area, evolved, into, the, bronze, age, erlitou, culture, the, earliest, bronze, artifacts, have, been, found, in, the, majiayao, culture, site, 3100, 2700, bc, chinese, civilization, begins, during, the, second, phase, of, the, erlitou, period, 1900, 1500, bc, with, erlitou, considered, the, first, state, level, society, of, east, asia, there, is, considerable, debate, whether, erlitou, sites, correlate, to, the, semi, legendary, xia, dynasty, the, xia, dynasty, 2070, 1600, bc, is, the, first, dynasty, to, be, described, in, ancient, chinese, historical, records, such, as, the, bamboo, annals, first, published, more, than, a, millennium, later, during, the, western, zhou, period, although, xia, is, an, important, element, in, chinese, historiography, there, is, to, date, no, contemporary, written, evidence, to, corroborate, the, dynasty, erlitou, saw, an, increase, in, bronze, metallurgy, and, urbanization, and, was, a, rapidly, growing, regional, center, with, palatial, complexes, that, provide, evidence, for, social, stratification, the, erlitou, civilization, is, divided, into, four, phases, each, of, roughly, 50, years, during, phase, i, covering, 100, hectares, 250, acres, erlitou, was, a, rapidly, growing, regional, center, with, estimated, population, of, several, thousand, but, not, yet, an, urban, civilization, or, capital, urbanization, began, in, phase, ii, expanding, to, 300, ha, 740, acres, with, a, population, around, 11, 000, a, palace, area, of, 12, ha, 30, acres, was, demarcated, by, four, roads, it, contained, the, 150x50, m, palace, 3, composed, of, three, courtyards, along, a, 150, meter, axis, and, palace, 5, a, bronze, foundry, was, established, to, the, south, of, the, palatial, complex, that, was, controlled, by, the, elite, who, lived, in, palaces, the, city, reached, its, peak, in, phase, iii, and, may, have, had, a, population, of, around, 24, 000, the, palatial, complex, was, surrounded, by, a, two, meter, thick, rammed, earth, wall, and, palaces, 1, 7, 8, 9, were, built, the, earthwork, volume, of, rammed, earth, for, the, base, of, largest, palace, 1, is, 20, 000, m, at, least, palaces, 3, and, 5, were, abandoned, and, replaced, by, 4, 200, square, meter, 45, 000, sq, ft, palace, 2, and, palace, 4, in, phase, iv, the, population, decreased, to, around, 20, 000, but, building, continued, palace, 6, was, built, as, an, extension, of, palace, 2, and, palaces, 10, and, 11, were, built, phase, iv, overlaps, with, the, lower, phase, of, the, erligang, culture, 1600, 1450, bc, around, 1600, to, 1560, bc, about, 6, km, northeast, of, erlitou, a, culturally, erligang, walled, city, was, built, at, yanshi, which, coincides, with, an, increase, in, production, of, arrowheads, at, erlitou, this, situation, might, indicate, that, the, yanshi, city, was, competing, for, power, and, dominance, with, erlitou, production, of, bronzes, and, other, elite, goods, ceased, at, the, end, of, phase, iv, at, the, same, time, as, the, erligang, city, of, zhengzhou, was, established, 85, km, 53, mi, to, the, east, there, is, no, evidence, of, destruction, by, fire, or, war, but, during, the, upper, erligang, phase, 1450, 1300, bc, all, the, palaces, were, abandoned, and, erlitou, was, reduced, to, a, village, of, 30, ha, 74, acres, the, earliest, traditional, chinese, dynasty, for, which, there, is, both, archeological, and, written, evidence, is, the, shang, dynasty, 1600, 1046, bc, shang, sites, have, yielded, the, earliest, known, body, of, chinese, writing, the, oracle, bone, script, mostly, divinations, inscribed, on, bones, these, inscriptions, provide, critical, insight, into, many, topics, from, the, politics, economy, and, religious, practices, to, the, art, and, medicine, of, this, early, stage, of, chinese, civilization, some, historians, argue, that, erlitou, should, be, considered, an, early, phase, of, the, shang, dynasty, the, u, s, national, gallery, of, art, defines, the, chinese, bronze, age, as, the, period, between, about, 2000, and, 771, bc, a, period, that, begins, with, the, erlitou, culture, and, ends, abruptly, with, the, disintegration, of, western, zhou, rule, the, sanxingdui, culture, is, another, chinese, bronze, age, society, contemporaneous, to, the, shang, dynasty, however, they, developed, a, different, method, of, bronze, making, from, the, shang, the, earliest, archaeological, artifacts, in, iran, were, found, in, the, kashafrud, and, ganj, par, sites, that, are, thought, to, date, back, to, 10, 000, years, ago, in, the, middle, paleolithic, mousterian, stone, tools, made, by, neanderthals, have, also, been, found, there, are, more, cultural, remains, of, neanderthals, dating, back, to, the, middle, paleolithic, period, which, mainly, have, been, found, in, the, zagros, region, and, fewer, in, central, iran, at, sites, such, as, kobeh, kunji, bisitun, cave, tamtama, warwasi, and, yafteh, cave, in, 1949, a, neanderthal, radius, was, discovered, by, carleton, s, coon, in, bisitun, cave, evidence, for, upper, paleolithic, and, epipaleolithic, periods, are, known, mainly, from, the, zagros, mountains, in, the, caves, of, kermanshah, and, khorramabad, and, a, few, number, of, sites, in, piranshahr, and, alborz, and, central, iran, during, this, time, people, began, creating, rock, art, early, agricultural, communities, such, as, chogha, golan, in, 10, 000, bc, along, with, settlements, such, as, chogha, bonut, the, earliest, village, in, elam, in, 8000, bc, began, to, flourish, in, and, around, the, zagros, mountains, region, in, western, iran, around, about, the, same, time, the, earliest, known, clay, vessels, and, modelled, human, and, animal, terracotta, figurines, were, produced, at, ganj, dareh, also, in, western, iran, there, are, also, 10, 000, year, old, human, and, animal, figurines, from, tepe, sarab, in, kermanshah, province, among, many, other, ancient, artefacts, the, south, western, part, of, iran, was, part, of, the, fertile, crescent, where, most, of, humanity, s, first, major, crops, were, grown, in, villages, such, as, susa, where, a, settlement, was, first, founded, possibly, as, early, as, 4395, cal, bc, 46, 47, and, settlements, such, as, chogha, mish, dating, back, to, 6800, bc, now, on, display, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, and, ruins, of, 7000, year, old, settlements, such, as, tepe, sialk, are, further, testament, to, that, the, two, main, neolithic, iranian, settlements, were, ganj, dareh, and, the, hypothetical, zayandeh, river, culture, parts, of, what, is, modern, day, northwestern, iran, was, part, of, the, kura, araxes, culture, circa, 3400, bc, ca, 2000, bc, that, stretched, up, into, the, neighbouring, regions, of, the, caucasus, and, anatolia, susa, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, settlements, of, iran, and, the, world, based, on, c14, dating, the, time, of, the, foundation, of, the, city, is, as, early, as, 4395, bc, 45, 46, a, time, right, after, the, establishment, of, the, ancient, sumerian, city, of, uruk, in, 4500, bc, the, general, perception, among, archaeologists, is, that, susa, was, an, extension, of, the, sumerian, city, state, of, uruk, hence, incorporating, many, aspects, of, mesopotamian, culture, in, its, later, history, susa, became, the, capital, of, elam, which, emerged, as, a, state, founded, 4000, bc, 45, 46, there, are, also, dozens, of, prehistoric, sites, across, the, iranian, plateau, pointing, to, the, existence, of, ancient, cultures, and, urban, settlements, in, the, fourth, millennium, bc, one, of, the, earliest, civilizations, on, the, iranian, plateau, was, the, jiroft, culture, in, southeastern, iran, in, the, province, of, kerman, it, is, one, of, the, most, artefact, rich, archaeological, sites, in, the, middle, east, archaeological, excavations, in, jiroft, led, to, the, discovery, of, several, objects, belonging, to, the, 4th, millennium, bc, there, is, a, large, quantity, of, objects, decorated, with, highly, distinctive, engravings, of, animals, mythological, figures, and, architectural, motifs, the, objects, and, their, iconography, are, considered, unique, many, are, made, from, chlorite, a, grey, green, soft, stone, others, are, in, copper, bronze, terracotta, and, even, lapis, lazuli, recent, excavations, at, the, sites, have, produced, the, world, s, earliest, inscription, which, pre, dates, mesopotamian, inscriptions, there, are, records, of, numerous, other, ancient, civilizations, on, the, iranian, plateau, before, the, emergence, of, iranian, peoples, during, the, early, iron, age, the, early, bronze, age, saw, the, rise, of, urbanization, into, organized, city, states, and, the, invention, of, writing, the, uruk, period, in, the, near, east, while, bronze, age, elam, made, use, of, writing, from, an, early, time, the, proto, elamite, script, remains, undeciphered, the, earliest, evidence, of, agriculture, in, the, andean, region, dates, to, around, 9000, bc, in, ecuador, at, sites, of, the, las, vegas, culture, the, bottle, gourd, may, have, been, the, first, plant, cultivated, the, oldest, evidence, of, canal, irrigation, in, south, america, dates, to, 4700, to, 2500, bc, in, the, za, a, valley, of, northern, peru, the, earliest, urban, settlements, of, the, andes, as, well, as, north, and, south, america, are, dated, to, 3500, bc, at, huaricanga, in, the, fortaleza, area, and, sechin, bajo, near, the, sechin, river, both, sites, are, in, peru, the, caral, supe, or, norte, chico, civilization, is, understood, to, have, emerged, around, 3200, bc, as, it, is, at, that, point, that, large, scale, human, settlement, and, communal, construction, across, multiple, sites, becomes, clearly, apparent, in, the, early, 21st, century, peruvian, archaeologist, ruth, shady, established, caral, supe, as, the, oldest, known, civilization, in, the, americas, the, civilization, flourished, near, the, pacific, coast, in, the, valleys, of, three, small, rivers, the, fortaleza, the, pativilca, and, the, supe, these, river, valleys, each, have, large, clusters, of, sites, further, south, there, are, several, associated, sites, along, the, huaura, river, notable, settlements, include, the, cities, of, caral, the, largest, and, most, complex, preceramic, site, and, aspero, norte, chico, is, distinguished, by, its, density, of, large, sites, with, immense, architecture, haas, argues, that, the, density, of, sites, in, such, a, small, area, is, globally, unique, for, a, nascent, civilization, during, the, third, millennium, bc, norte, chico, may, have, been, the, most, densely, populated, area, of, the, world, excepting, possibly, northern, china, the, supe, pativilca, fortaleza, and, huaura, river, valleys, each, have, several, related, sites, norte, chico, is, unusual, in, that, it, completely, lacked, ceramics, and, apparently, had, almost, no, visual, art, nevertheless, the, civilization, exhibited, impressive, architectural, feats, including, large, earthwork, platform, mounds, and, sunken, circular, plazas, and, an, advanced, textile, industry, the, platform, mounds, as, well, as, large, stone, warehouses, provide, evidence, for, a, stratified, society, and, a, centralized, authority, necessary, to, distribute, resources, such, as, cotton, however, there, is, no, evidence, of, warfare, or, defensive, structures, during, this, period, originally, it, was, theorized, that, unlike, other, early, civilizations, norte, chico, developed, by, relying, on, maritime, food, sources, in, place, of, a, staple, cereal, this, hypothesis, the, maritime, foundation, of, andean, civilization, is, still, hotly, debated, however, most, researches, now, agree, that, agriculture, played, a, central, role, in, the, civilization, s, development, while, still, acknowledging, a, strong, supplemental, reliance, on, maritime, proteins, the, norte, chico, chiefdoms, were, almost, certainly, theocratic, though, not, brutally, so, according, to, mann, construction, areas, show, possible, evidence, of, feasting, which, would, have, included, music, and, likely, alcohol, suggesting, an, elite, able, to, both, mobilize, and, reward, the, population, the, degree, of, centralized, authority, is, difficult, to, ascertain, but, architectural, construction, patterns, are, indicative, of, an, elite, that, at, least, in, certain, places, at, certain, times, wielded, considerable, power, while, some, of, the, monumental, architecture, was, constructed, incrementally, other, buildings, such, as, the, two, main, platform, mounds, at, caral, appear, to, have, been, constructed, in, one, or, two, intense, construction, phases, as, further, evidence, of, centralized, control, haas, points, to, remains, of, large, stone, warehouses, found, at, upaca, on, the, pativilca, as, emblematic, of, authorities, able, to, control, vital, resources, such, as, cotton, economic, authority, would, have, rested, on, the, control, of, cotton, and, edible, plants, and, associated, trade, relationships, with, power, centered, on, the, inland, sites, haas, tentatively, suggests, that, the, scope, of, this, economic, power, base, may, have, extended, widely, there, are, only, two, confirmed, shore, sites, in, the, norte, chico, aspero, and, bandurria, and, possibly, two, more, but, cotton, fishing, nets, and, domesticated, plants, have, been, found, up, and, down, the, peruvian, coast, it, is, possible, that, the, major, inland, centers, of, norte, chico, were, at, the, center, of, a, broad, regional, trade, network, centered, on, these, resources, discover, magazine, citing, shady, suggests, a, rich, and, varied, trade, life, exported, its, own, products, and, those, of, aspero, to, distant, communities, in, exchange, for, exotic, imports, spondylus, shells, from, the, coast, of, ecuador, rich, dyes, from, the, andean, highlands, hallucinogenic, snuff, from, the, amazon, given, the, still, limited, extent, of, norte, chico, research, such, claims, should, be, treated, circumspectly, other, reports, on, shady, s, work, indicate, caral, traded, with, communities, in, the, andes, and, in, the, jungles, of, the, amazon, basin, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, andes, leaders, ideological, power, was, based, on, apparent, access, to, deities, and, the, supernatural, evidence, regarding, norte, chico, religion, is, limited, an, image, of, the, staff, god, a, leering, figure, with, a, hood, and, fangs, has, been, found, on, a, gourd, dated, to, 2250, bc, the, staff, god, is, a, major, deity, of, later, andean, cultures, and, winifred, creamer, suggests, the, find, points, to, worship, of, common, symbols, of, gods, as, with, much, other, research, at, norte, chico, the, nature, and, significance, of, the, find, has, been, disputed, by, other, researchers, the, act, of, architectural, construction, and, maintenance, may, also, have, been, a, spiritual, or, religious, experience, a, process, of, communal, exaltation, and, ceremony, shady, has, called, caral, the, sacred, city, la, ciudad, sagrada, socio, economic, and, political, focus, was, on, the, temples, which, were, periodically, remodeled, with, major, burnt, offerings, associated, with, the, remodeling, bundles, of, strings, uncovered, at, norte, chico, sites, have, been, identified, as, quipu, a, type, of, pre, writing, recording, device, quipu, are, thought, to, encode, numeric, information, but, some, have, conjectured, that, quipu, have, been, used, to, encode, other, forms, of, data, possibly, including, literary, or, musical, applications, however, the, exact, use, of, quipu, by, the, norte, chico, and, later, andean, cultures, has, been, widely, debated, the, presence, of, quipu, and, the, commonality, of, religious, symbols, suggests, a, cultural, link, between, norte, chico, and, later, andean, cultures, circa, 1800, bc, the, norte, chico, civilization, began, to, decline, with, more, powerful, centers, appearing, to, the, south, and, north, along, the, coast, and, to, the, east, inside, the, belt, of, the, andes, pottery, eventually, developed, in, the, amazon, basin, and, spread, to, the, andean, culture, region, around, 2000, bc, the, next, major, civilization, to, arise, in, the, andes, would, be, the, chav, n, culture, at, chav, n, de, huantar, located, in, the, andean, highlands, of, the, present, day, ancash, region, it, is, believed, to, have, been, built, around, 900, bc, and, was, the, religious, and, political, center, of, the, chav, n, people, maize, is, believed, to, have, been, first, domesticated, in, southern, mexico, about, 7000, bc, the, coxcatlan, caves, in, the, valley, of, tehuac, n, provide, evidence, for, agriculture, in, components, dated, between, 5000, and, 3400, bc, similarly, sites, such, as, sipacate, in, guatemala, provide, maize, pollen, samples, dating, to, 3500, bc, around, 1900, bc, the, mokaya, domesticated, one, of, the, dozen, species, of, cacao, a, mokaya, archaeological, site, provides, evidence, of, cacao, beverages, dating, to, this, time, the, mokaya, are, also, thought, to, have, been, among, the, first, cultures, in, mesoamerica, to, develop, a, hierarchical, society, what, would, become, the, olmec, civilization, had, its, roots, in, early, farming, cultures, of, tabasco, which, began, around, 5100, to, 4600, bc, the, emergence, of, the, olmec, civilization, has, traditionally, been, dated, to, around, 1600, to, 1500, bc, olmec, features, first, emerged, in, the, city, of, san, lorenzo, tenochtitl, n, fully, coalescing, around, 1400, bc, the, rise, of, civilization, was, assisted, by, the, local, ecology, of, well, watered, alluvial, soil, as, well, as, by, the, transportation, network, provided, by, the, coatzacoalcos, river, basin, this, environment, encouraged, a, densely, concentrated, population, which, in, turn, triggered, the, rise, of, an, elite, class, and, an, associated, demand, for, the, production, of, the, symbolic, and, sophisticated, luxury, artifacts, that, define, olmec, culture, many, of, these, luxury, artifacts, were, made, from, materials, such, as, jade, obsidian, and, magnetite, which, came, from, distant, locations, and, suggest, that, early, olmec, elites, had, access, to, an, extensive, trading, network, in, mesoamerica, the, aspect, of, olmec, culture, perhaps, most, familiar, today, is, their, artwork, particularly, the, olmec, colossal, heads, san, lorenzo, was, situated, in, the, midst, of, a, large, agricultural, area, san, lorenzo, seems, to, have, been, largely, a, ceremonial, site, a, town, without, city, walls, centered, in, the, midst, of, a, widespread, medium, to, large, agricultural, population, the, ceremonial, center, and, attendant, buildings, could, have, housed, 5, 500, while, the, entire, area, including, hinterlands, could, have, reached, 13, 000, it, is, thought, that, while, san, lorenzo, controlled, much, or, all, of, the, coatzacoalcos, basin, areas, to, the, east, such, as, the, area, where, la, venta, would, rise, to, prominence, and, north, northwest, such, as, the, tuxtla, mountains, were, home, to, independent, polities, san, lorenzo, was, all, but, abandoned, around, 900, bc, at, about, the, same, time, that, la, venta, rose, to, prominence, a, wholesale, destruction, of, many, san, lorenzo, monuments, also, occurred, circa, 950, bc, which, may, indicate, an, internal, uprising, or, less, likely, an, invasion, the, latest, thinking, however, is, that, environmental, changes, may, have, been, responsible, for, this, shift, in, olmec, centers, with, certain, important, rivers, changing, course, la, venta, became, the, cultural, capital, of, the, olmec, concentration, in, the, region, until, its, abandonment, around, 400, bc, constructing, monumental, architectural, achievements, such, as, the, great, pyramid, of, la, venta, it, contained, a, concentration, of, power, as, reflected, by, the, sheer, enormity, of, the, architecture, and, the, extreme, value, of, the, artifacts, uncovered, la, venta, is, perhaps, the, largest, olmec, city, and, it, was, controlled, and, expanded, by, an, extremely, complex, hierarchical, system, with, a, king, as, the, ruler, and, the, elites, below, him, priests, had, power, and, influence, over, life, and, death, and, likely, great, political, sway, as, well, unfortunately, not, much, is, known, about, the, political, or, social, structure, of, the, olmec, though, new, dating, techniques, might, at, some, point, reveal, more, information, about, this, elusive, culture, it, is, possible, that, the, signs, of, status, exist, in, the, artifacts, recovered, at, the, site, such, as, depictions, of, feathered, headdresses, or, of, individuals, wearing, a, mirror, on, their, chest, or, forehead, high, status, objects, were, a, significant, source, of, power, in, the, la, venta, polity, political, power, economic, power, and, ideological, power, they, were, tools, used, by, the, elite, to, enhance, and, maintain, rights, to, rulership, it, has, been, estimated, that, la, venta, would, need, to, be, supported, by, a, population, of, at, least, 18, 000, people, during, its, principal, occupation, to, add, to, the, mystique, of, la, venta, the, alluvial, soil, did, not, preserve, skeletal, remains, so, it, is, difficult, to, observe, differences, in, burials, however, colossal, heads, provide, proof, that, the, elite, had, some, control, over, the, lower, classes, as, their, construction, would, have, been, extremely, labor, intensive, other, features, similarly, indicate, that, many, laborers, were, involved, in, addition, excavations, over, the, years, have, discovered, that, different, parts, of, the, site, were, likely, reserved, for, elites, and, other, parts, for, non, elites, this, segregation, of, the, city, indicates, that, there, must, have, been, social, classes, and, therefore, social, inequality, the, exact, cause, of, the, decline, of, the, olmec, culture, is, uncertain, between, 400, and, 350, bc, the, population, in, the, eastern, half, of, the, olmec, heartland, dropped, precipitously, this, depopulation, was, probably, the, result, of, serious, environmental, changes, that, rendered, the, region, unsuited, for, large, groups, of, farmers, in, particular, changes, to, the, riverine, environment, that, the, olmec, depended, upon, for, agriculture, hunting, and, gathering, and, transportation, these, changes, may, have, been, triggered, by, tectonic, upheavals, or, subsidence, or, the, silting, up, of, rivers, due, to, agricultural, practices, within, a, few, hundred, years, of, the, abandonment, of, the, last, olmec, cities, successor, cultures, became, firmly, established, the, tres, zapotes, site, on, the, western, edge, of, the, olmec, heartland, continued, to, be, occupied, well, past, 400, bc, but, without, the, hallmarks, of, the, olmec, culture, this, post, olmec, culture, often, labeled, epi, olmec, has, features, similar, to, those, found, at, izapa, some, 550, km, 330, miles, to, the, southeast, the, olmecs, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, mother, culture, of, mesoamerica, as, they, were, the, first, mesoamerican, civilization, and, laid, many, of, the, foundations, for, the, civilizations, that, followed, however, the, causes, and, degree, of, olmec, influences, on, mesoamerican, cultures, has, been, a, subject, of, debate, over, many, decades, practices, introduced, by, the, olmec, include, ritual, bloodletting, and, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, hallmarks, of, subsequent, mesoamerican, societies, such, as, the, maya, and, aztec, although, the, mesoamerican, writing, system, would, fully, develop, later, early, olmec, ceramics, show, representations, that, may, be, interpreted, as, codices, the, origins, of, western, civilization, can, be, traced, back, to, the, ancient, mediterranean, world, there, is, academic, consensus, that, although, ancient, greece, developed, in, contact, with, much, older, civilizations, around, the, mediterranean, it, was, a, major, culture, that, provided, the, foundation, of, modern, western, culture, philosophy, democracy, art, science, aesthetics, theatre, as, well, as, building, designs, and, proportions, and, architecture, along, with, greece, ancient, rome, has, sometimes, been, described, as, a, birthplace, or, as, the, cradle, of, western, civilization, because, of, the, role, the, city, had, in, politics, republicanism, law, architecture, warfare, and, western, christianity, western, civilization, is, also, closely, associated, with, christianity, the, predominant, religion, in, the, west, which, has, its, origins, in, judaism, the, ethnic, religion, of, the, jewish, people, and, greco, roman, philosophy, christianity, emerged, as, a, sect, within, judaism, and, inherited, many, of, its, foundational, beliefs, scriptures, and, ethical, principles, from, jewish, tradition, christian, ethics, influenced, by, its, jewish, roots, has, significantly, influenced, the, foundational, principles, of, western, societies, the, blending, of, greco, roman, and, judeo, christian, traditions, in, shaping, western, civilization, has, led, scholars, to, describe, it, as, emerging, from, the, legacies, of, athens, and, jerusalem, or, athens, jerusalem, and, rome, the, phrase, cradle, of, civilization, plays, a, certain, role, in, national, mysticism, it, has, been, used, in, eastern, as, well, as, western, cultures, for, instance, in, indian, nationalism, in, search, of, the, cradle, of, civilization, 1995, and, taiwanese, nationalism, taiwan, the, cradle, of, civilization, 2002, the, terms, also, appear, in, esoteric, pseudohistory, such, as, the, urantia, book, claiming, the, title, for, the, second, eden, or, the, pseudoarchaeology, related, to, megalithic, britain, civilization, one, 2004, ancient, britain, the, cradle, of, civilization, 1921, the, following, timeline, shows, a, timeline, of, cultures, with, the, approximate, dates, of, the, emergence, of,
