19th, century, the, dutch, fought, many, wars, against, indigenous, rulers, and, peoples, which, caused, hundreds, of, thousands, of, deaths, dutch, rule, reached, its, greatest, territorial, extent, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, the, occupation, of, western, new, guinea, the, dutch, east, indies, was, one, of, the, most, valuable, colonies, under, european, rule, though, its, profits, depended, on, exploitative, labor, the, colony, contributed, to, dutch, global, prominence, in, spice, and, cash, crop, trade, in, the, 19th, century, and, coal, and, oil, exploration, in, the, 20th, century, the, colonial, social, order, was, rigidly, racial, with, the, dutch, elite, living, separately, from, but, linked, to, their, native, subjects, the, term, indonesia, was, used, for, the, geographical, location, after, 1880, in, the, early, 20th, century, local, intellectuals, conceived, indonesia, as, a, nation, state, setting, the, stage, for, an, independence, movement, japan, s, world, war, ii, occupation, dismantled, much, of, the, dutch, colonial, state, and, economy, following, the, japanese, surrender, on, 15, august, 1945, indonesian, nationalist, leaders, sukarno, and, hatta, declared, independence, instigating, the, indonesian, national, revolution, the, dutch, aiming, to, re, establish, control, of, the, archipelago, responded, by, deploying, roughly, 220, 000, troops, which, fought, the, indonesian, nationalists, in, attrition, warfare, the, united, states, threatened, to, terminate, financial, aid, for, the, netherlands, under, the, marshall, plan, if, they, did, not, agree, to, transfer, sovereignty, to, indonesia, leading, to, dutch, recognition, of, indonesian, sovereignty, at, the, 1949, dutch, indonesian, round, table, conference, indonesia, became, one, of, the, leading, nations, of, the, asian, independence, movement, after, world, war, ii, during, the, revolution, and, after, indonesian, independence, almost, all, dutch, citizens, repatriated, to, the, netherlands, in, 1962, the, dutch, turned, over, their, last, possession, in, southeast, asia, dutch, new, guinea, western, new, guinea, to, indonesia, under, the, provisions, of, the, new, york, agreement, at, that, point, the, entirety, of, the, colony, ceased, to, exist, the, word, indies, comes, from, latin, indus, names, for, india, the, original, name, dutch, indies, dutch, nederlandsch, indi, was, translated, by, the, english, as, the, dutch, east, indies, to, keep, it, distinct, from, the, dutch, west, indies, the, name, dutch, indies, is, recorded, in, the, dutch, east, india, company, s, documents, of, the, early, 1620s, scholars, writing, in, english, use, the, terms, indi, indies, the, dutch, east, indies, the, netherlands, indies, and, colonial, indonesia, interchangeably, at, the, time, when, europeans, arrived, the, indonesian, archipelago, supported, various, states, including, commercially, oriented, coastal, trading, states, and, inland, agrarian, states, the, most, important, were, srivijaya, and, majapahit, since, centuries, bce, the, islands, were, part, of, migratory, and, commercial, exchange, within, southeast, asia, india, arabian, peninsula, and, east, africa, from, classical, antiquity, onwards, the, archipelago, was, also, a, major, part, of, the, global, spice, trade, for, centuries, hindu, buddhist, civilizations, were, dominant, however, increasing, trade, links, instigated, the, spread, of, islam, by, the, 16th, century, a, large, part, of, the, archipelago, was, ruled, under, islamic, kingdoms, except, bali, that, retained, a, hindu, majority, sultanates, city, states, local, kingdoms, and, tribes, were, all, connected, through, trade, creating, a, mixed, hindu, buddhist, islamic, culture, and, malay, as, a, lingua, franca, throughout, the, region, the, islands, were, known, to, the, europeans, and, were, sporadically, visited, by, expeditions, such, as, that, of, italians, marco, polo, in, 1292, and, odoric, of, pordenone, in, 1321, the, first, europeans, to, establish, themselves, in, indonesia, were, the, portuguese, in, 1512, who, established, a, network, of, trading, posts, and, fortresses, throughout, the, region, including, at, the, spice, islands, of, the, maluku, islands, in, 1580, portugal, formed, a, union, with, spain, and, therewith, entered, the, war, with, the, dutch, republic, following, disruption, of, dutch, access, to, spices, the, first, dutch, expedition, set, sail, to, reach, the, east, indies, in, 1595, to, access, spices, directly, from, asia, after, many, skirmishes, and, hardships, only, one, third, of, the, original, crew, made, it, back, to, holland, and, other, dutch, expeditions, soon, followed, recognising, the, potential, of, the, east, indies, trade, the, dutch, government, amalgamated, the, competing, companies, into, the, united, east, india, company, vereenigde, oost, indische, compagnie, or, voc, in, march, 1602, the, voc, was, granted, a, charter, to, wage, war, build, fortresses, and, make, treaties, across, asia, a, capital, was, established, in, batavia, now, jakarta, which, became, the, center, of, the, voc, s, asian, trading, network, to, their, original, monopolies, on, nutmeg, peppers, cloves, and, cinnamon, the, company, and, later, colonial, administrations, introduced, non, indigenous, cash, crops, like, coffee, tea, cacao, tobacco, rubber, sugar, and, opium, and, safeguarded, their, commercial, interests, by, taking, over, surrounding, territory, smuggling, the, ongoing, expense, of, war, corruption, and, mismanagement, led, to, bankruptcy, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, company, was, formally, dissolved, in, 1800, and, its, colonial, possessions, in, the, indonesian, archipelago, including, much, of, java, parts, of, sumatra, much, of, maluku, and, the, hinterlands, of, ports, such, as, makasar, manado, and, kupang, were, nationalized, under, the, dutch, republic, as, the, dutch, east, indies, when, the, voc, arrived, in, the, indonesian, archipelago, they, started, to, use, and, expand, upon, the, then, existing, indigenous, system, of, slavery, in, certain, places, slaves, were, used, on, plantations, such, as, on, the, maluku, islands, namely, the, banda, islands, where, most, of, the, local, population, had, been, deported, or, exterminated, by, the, voc, to, be, replaced, with, slaves, dutch, slaves, worked, in, agriculture, manufacturing, and, services, but, most, were, used, as, domestic, servants, including, housemaids, and, houseboys, cooks, seamstresses, musicians, and, concubines, slaves, could, be, acquired, through, trade, at, indigenous, slave, markets, or, captured, on, raids, in, certain, cases, the, voc, stirred, up, ethnic, tensions, between, rivalling, populations, in, the, hope, they, could, cheaply, buy, war, captives, at, slave, markets, after, the, conflict, slaves, were, transported, from, islands, in, indonesia, itself, or, from, other, countries, such, as, india, and, china, estimates, of, the, scale, of, the, slave, trade, in, the, dutch, east, indies, are, scant, but, it, is, suggested, that, around, 1, million, slaves, were, active, during, its, peak, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, punishments, for, slaves, could, be, extremely, harsh, for, instance, runaway, slaves, and, their, accomplices, could, be, subject, to, whipping, chain, gangs, or, death, other, punishments, included, the, cutting, of, hands, ears, breasts, and, noses, forms, of, scaphism, being, burned, alive, and, the, breaking, wheel, in, theory, slave, masters, did, not, have, free, rein, to, punish, their, own, slaves, as, they, wished, punishments, of, slaves, had, to, be, decided, in, court, and, certain, punishments, could, only, be, applied, when, the, slave, was, found, guilty, in, an, official, court, case, in, reality, however, abuse, of, slaves, by, their, masters, was, rampant, and, often, went, unpunished, beatings, and, whippings, were, a, commonplace, punishment, for, disobedient, slaves, rape, of, female, slaves, by, their, masters, was, a, common, occurrence, as, well, as, these, women, and, girls, were, obliged, to, provide, sexual, services, for, their, masters, refusing, to, do, so, could, result, in, severe, physical, punishment, slavery, and, its, excesses, did, not, end, with, the, bankruptcy, of, the, voc, in, 1798, but, continued, under, dutch, state, rule, due, to, growing, international, criticism, slavery, was, eventually, abolished, in, the, dutch, east, indies, in, 1860, in, reality, this, was, mostly, limited, to, the, slaves, present, on, java, and, madura, whose, masters, were, financially, compensated, for, the, loss, of, their, workforce, however, on, many, other, islands, where, slave, masters, were, more, often, indigenous, rulers, little, changed, the, main, reason, for, this, was, financial, as, the, dutch, state, at, that, time, did, not, want, to, spend, the, money, necessary, to, free, the, slaves, on, the, more, distant, islands, another, reason, was, to, appease, local, rulers, and, to, prevent, political, turmoil, due, to, the, lax, policy, of, the, dutch, state, slavery, persisted, in, parts, of, the, dutch, east, indies, well, into, the, 20th, century, from, the, arrival, of, the, first, dutch, ships, in, the, late, 16th, century, to, the, declaration, of, independence, in, 1945, dutch, control, over, the, indonesian, archipelago, was, always, tenuous, although, java, was, dominated, by, the, dutch, many, areas, remained, independent, throughout, much, of, this, time, including, aceh, bali, lombok, and, borneo, there, were, numerous, wars, and, disturbances, across, the, archipelago, as, various, indigenous, groups, resisted, efforts, to, establish, dutch, hegemony, which, weakened, dutch, control, and, tied, up, its, military, forces, piracy, remained, a, problem, until, the, mid, 19th, century, finally, in, the, early, 20th, century, imperial, dominance, was, extended, across, what, was, to, become, the, territory, of, modern, day, indonesia, in, 1806, with, the, netherlands, under, imperial, french, domination, emperor, napoleon, i, appointed, his, brother, louis, bonaparte, to, the, dutch, throne, which, led, to, the, 1808, appointment, of, marshal, herman, willem, daendels, as, governor, general, of, the, dutch, east, indies, in, 1811, daendels, was, replaced, by, governor, general, jan, willem, janssens, but, shortly, after, his, arrival, british, forces, occupied, several, dutch, east, indies, ports, including, the, spice, islands, in, 1810, and, java, the, following, year, leading, to, sir, thomas, stamford, raffles, becoming, lieutenant, governor, following, napoleon, s, defeat, at, the, 1815, battle, of, waterloo, and, the, congress, of, vienna, independent, dutch, control, was, restored, in, 1816, on, the, basis, of, the, anglo, dutch, treaty, of, 1814, the, commissioners, general, of, the, dutch, east, indies, reformed, the, public, finances, of, the, colony, and, drew, up, a, new, regeringsreglement, that, would, define, the, government, of, the, colony, for, a, century, under, the, 1824, anglo, dutch, treaty, the, dutch, secured, the, kepaksian, pernong, sekala, brak, and, british, settlements, such, as, bengkulu, both, in, sumatra, and, the, british, secured, the, dutch, settlement, of, singapore, as, well, as, dutch, possessions, in, the, malay, peninsula, malaya, and, dutch, india, the, resulting, borders, between, former, british, and, dutch, possessions, remain, today, between, modern, malaysia, and, indonesia, since, the, establishment, of, the, voc, in, the, 17th, century, the, expansion, of, dutch, territory, had, been, a, business, matter, graaf, van, den, bosch, s, governor, generalship, 1830, 1835, confirmed, profitability, as, the, foundation, of, official, policy, restricting, its, attention, to, java, sumatra, and, bangka, however, from, about, 1840, dutch, national, expansionism, saw, them, wage, a, series, of, wars, to, enlarge, and, consolidate, their, possessions, in, the, outer, islands, motivations, included, the, protection, of, areas, already, held, the, intervention, of, dutch, officials, ambitious, for, glory, or, promotion, and, the, aim, to, establish, dutch, claims, throughout, the, archipelago, to, prevent, intervention, from, other, western, powers, during, the, european, push, for, colonial, possessions, as, exploitation, of, indonesian, resources, expanded, off, java, most, of, the, outer, islands, came, under, direct, dutch, government, control, or, influence, the, dutch, subjugated, the, minangkabau, of, sumatra, in, the, padri, war, 1821, 38, and, the, java, war, 1825, 30, ended, significant, javanese, resistance, the, banjarmasin, war, 1859, 1863, in, southeast, kalimantan, resulted, in, the, defeat, of, the, sultan, after, failed, expeditions, to, conquer, bali, in, 1846, and, 1848, an, 1849, intervention, brought, northern, bali, under, dutch, control, the, most, prolonged, military, expedition, was, the, aceh, war, in, which, a, dutch, invasion, in, 1873, was, met, with, indigenous, guerrilla, resistance, and, ended, with, an, acehnese, surrender, in, 1912, disturbances, continued, to, break, out, on, both, java, and, sumatra, during, the, remainder, of, the, 19th, century, this, included, the, banten, peasant, s, revolt, in, the, aftermath, of, the, tremendous, eruption, of, krakatoa, in, 1883, however, the, island, of, lombok, came, under, dutch, control, in, 1894, and, batak, resistance, in, northern, sumatra, was, quashed, in, 1895, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, balance, of, military, power, shifted, towards, the, industrialising, dutch, and, against, pre, industrial, independent, indigenous, indonesian, polities, as, the, technology, gap, widened, military, leaders, and, dutch, politicians, believed, they, had, a, moral, duty, to, free, the, native, indonesian, peoples, from, indigenous, rulers, who, were, considered, oppressive, backward, or, disrespectful, of, international, law, although, indonesian, rebellions, broke, out, direct, colonial, rule, was, extended, throughout, the, rest, of, the, archipelago, from, 1901, to, 1910, and, control, taken, from, the, remaining, independent, local, rulers, southwestern, sulawesi, was, occupied, in, 1905, 06, the, island, of, bali, was, subjugated, with, military, conquests, in, 1906, and, 1908, as, were, the, remaining, independent, kingdoms, in, maluku, sumatra, kalimantan, and, nusa, tenggara, other, rulers, including, the, sultans, of, tidore, in, maluku, pontianak, kalimantan, and, palembang, in, sumatra, requested, dutch, protection, from, independent, neighbours, thereby, avoiding, dutch, military, conquest, and, were, able, to, negotiate, better, conditions, under, colonial, rule, the, bird, s, head, peninsula, western, new, guinea, was, brought, under, dutch, administration, in, 1920, this, final, territorial, range, would, form, the, territory, of, the, republic, of, indonesia, the, colonial, wars, in, the, dutch, east, indies, exacted, a, heavy, toll, on, the, indonesian, population, with, around, 3, to, 4, million, deaths, including, both, direct, war, casualties, and, indirect, victims, of, war, due, to, famine, and, disease, due, to, the, high, monetary, costs, of, several, dutch, conquests, in, the, 19th, century, the, cultivation, system, cultuurstelsel, was, implemented, in, 1830, under, this, system, it, was, stipulated, that, indonesian, farmers, had, to, use, 20, of, their, farmland, for, the, cultivation, of, cash, crops, for, export, such, as, indigo, coffee, and, sugar, through, this, system, considerable, profits, were, made, the, net, profit, for, the, dutch, treasury, is, estimated, at, 4, of, the, dutch, gdp, at, the, time, and, around, 50, of, total, state, revenue, the, system, proved, disastrous, for, the, local, population, at, its, height, over, 1, million, farmers, worked, under, the, cultuurstelsel, and, the, extreme, incentive, for, profit, resulted, in, widespread, abuses, farmers, were, often, forced, to, either, use, more, than, 20, of, their, farmland, or, the, most, fertile, land, for, cultivation, of, cash, crops, the, system, led, to, an, increase, in, famine, and, disease, among, javanese, peasants, in, the, 1840s, according, to, one, estimate, the, mortality, rates, increased, by, as, much, as, 30, during, this, period, due, to, widespread, criticism, of, the, system, it, was, abolished, in, 1870, according, to, one, study, the, mortality, rate, in, java, would, have, been, 10, 20, higher, by, the, late, 1870s, if, the, cultivation, system, had, not, been, abolished, the, introduction, of, trucks, railways, telegraph, systems, and, more, coordinated, distribution, systems, all, contributed, to, famine, elimination, in, java, which, had, historically, been, common, java, experienced, rapid, population, growth, during, the, 19th, century, and, there, were, no, significant, famines, in, java, after, the, 1840s, another, source, of, profit, were, the, so, called, coolies, a, name, for, low, wage, indentured, laborers, after, the, abolition, of, the, cultivation, system, in, 1870, the, economy, shifted, to, private, companies, such, as, the, deli, company, which, was, founded, on, sumatra, in, 1869, large, scale, plantations, were, built, to, grow, cash, crops, and, javanese, chinese, malay, batak, and, indian, people, were, shipped, to, the, plantations, in, sumatra, and, java, to, perform, harsh, labor, it, is, estimated, that, over, 500, 000, coolies, were, transported, to, sumatra, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, the, precise, death, rate, among, coolie, laborers, is, hard, to, estimate, due, to, scarce, or, unreliable, records, but, has, been, estimated, to, be, as, high, as, 25, in, certain, places, with, a, possible, death, toll, of, many, tens, of, thousands, while, coolies, were, often, paid, laborers, who, worked, out, of, free, will, in, practice, their, circumstances, often, involved, forced, labor, and, more, closely, resembled, slavery, they, were, often, misled, when, signing, work, contracts, or, even, forced, to, sign, contracts, others, were, kidnapped, or, forced, to, work, due, to, debts, or, were, criminals, sentenced, to, forced, labour, by, the, colonial, justice, system, the, coolie, ordinances, poenale, sanctie, of, 1880, which, allowed, the, plantation, owners, to, serve, as, judge, jury, and, executioner, resulted, in, widespread, atrocities, it, included, a, penal, sanction, which, allowed, owners, to, physically, punish, their, coolies, as, they, saw, fit, punishments, that, were, used, against, coolies, included, whippings, or, beatings, after, which, the, open, wounds, were, rubbed, with, salt, other, punishments, used, were, electrocution, crucifixion, and, suspending, coolies, by, their, toes, or, thumbs, until, they, broke, medical, care, for, the, coolies, was, scarce, and, often, aimed, at, healing, punished, coolies, so, they, could, return, to, work, or, be, tortured, more, extensively, rape, of, adult, female, coolies, as, well, as, their, children, was, also, common, the, coolie, system, was, heavily, criticized, especially, after, 1900, with, the, rise, of, the, so, called, ethical, politics, a, critical, pamphlet, named, de, miljoenen, uit, deli, was, published, by, j, van, den, brand, the, document, described, abuses, committed, against, coolies, including, the, torture, and, sexual, abuse, of, a, 15, year, old, female, coolie, who, had, rejected, sexual, advances, of, a, dutch, plantation, overseer, the, penal, sanction, was, eventually, abolished, in, 1931, and, the, coolie, ordinances, ended, in, the, early, 1940s, during, earlier, stages, of, colonization, female, indigenous, sex, slaves, were, bought, by, dutch, colonials, but, this, practice, was, cut, short, after, 1860, with, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, late, 19th, century, increasing, numbers, of, dutch, immigrants, arrived, in, colonial, indonesia, leading, to, a, shortage, of, available, women, as, most, immigrants, were, men, the, dutch, then, bought, the, njai, who, were, indigenous, women, who, officially, served, as, maids, but, were, often, also, used, as, concubines, while, officially, contract, workers, these, women, enjoyed, few, rights, they, could, be, bought, and, sold, together, with, the, house, they, worked, in, as, so, called, indigenous, furniture, inlands, meubel, njai, were, also, not, allowed, custody, of, the, children, they, had, with, their, dutch, masters, and, when, they, were, fired, their, children, would, be, taken, away, by, the, 1910s, the, number, of, njai, had, decreased, although, prostitution, had, become, more, prevalent, the, practice, had, not, died, out, however, by, the, time, the, empire, of, japan, invaded, and, occupied, the, indies, during, the, occupation, the, njai, and, their, mixed, race, children, were, forcefully, separated, from, european, men, who, were, put, into, internment, camps, after, sukarno, proclaimed, an, independent, indonesia, the, njai, were, forced, to, choose, between, going, with, their, partners, to, europe, or, staying, in, indonesia, the, netherlands, capitulated, their, european, territory, to, germany, on, may, 14, 1940, the, royal, family, fled, to, exile, in, britain, germany, and, japan, were, axis, allies, on, 27, september, 1940, germany, hungary, italy, and, japan, signed, a, treaty, outlining, spheres, of, influence, the, dutch, east, indies, fell, into, japan, s, sphere, the, netherlands, britain, and, the, united, states, tried, to, defend, the, colony, from, the, japanese, forces, as, they, moved, south, in, late, 1941, in, search, of, dutch, oil, on, 10, january, 1942, during, the, dutch, east, indies, campaign, japanese, forces, invaded, the, dutch, east, indies, as, part, of, the, pacific, war, the, rubber, plantations, and, oil, fields, of, the, dutch, east, indies, were, considered, crucial, for, the, japanese, war, effort, allied, forces, were, quickly, overwhelmed, by, the, japanese, and, on, 8, march, 1942, the, royal, dutch, east, indies, army, surrendered, in, java, fuelled, by, the, japanese, light, of, asia, war, propaganda, and, the, indonesian, national, awakening, a, vast, majority, of, the, indigenous, dutch, east, indies, population, first, welcomed, the, japanese, as, liberators, from, the, colonial, dutch, empire, but, this, sentiment, quickly, changed, as, the, occupation, turned, out, to, be, far, more, oppressive, and, ruinous, than, the, dutch, colonial, government, the, japanese, occupation, during, world, war, ii, brought, about, the, fall, of, the, colonial, state, in, indonesia, as, the, japanese, removed, as, much, of, the, dutch, government, structure, as, they, could, replacing, it, with, their, own, regime, although, the, top, positions, were, held, by, the, japanese, the, internment, of, all, dutch, citizens, meant, that, indonesians, filled, many, leadership, and, administrative, positions, in, contrast, to, dutch, repression, of, indonesian, nationalism, the, japanese, allowed, indigenous, leaders, to, forge, links, among, the, masses, and, they, trained, and, armed, the, younger, generations, according, to, a, un, report, four, million, people, died, in, indonesia, as, a, result, of, the, japanese, occupation, following, the, japanese, surrender, in, august, 1945, nationalist, leaders, sukarno, and, mohammad, hatta, declared, indonesian, independence, a, four, and, a, half, year, struggle, followed, as, the, dutch, tried, to, re, establish, their, colony, although, dutch, forces, re, occupied, most, of, indonesia, s, territory, a, guerrilla, struggle, ensued, and, the, majority, of, indonesians, and, ultimately, international, opinion, favoured, indonesian, independence, the, netherlands, committed, war, crimes, summary, and, arbitrary, killings, of, indonesian, villagers, and, farmers, torture, of, indonesian, prisoners, and, execution, of, prisoners, ad, van, liempt, documented, the, mass, murder, of, 364, indonesians, by, dutch,

independence, movement, during, the, later, phases, of, the, bersiap, also, targeted, dutch, and, eurasian, civilians, particularly, under, the, direction, of, sutomo, who, personally, supervised, the, summary, executions, of, hundreds, of, civilians, after, the, political, situation, in, indonesia, devolved, into, a, deadlock, the, new, dutch, government, led, by, louis, beel, of, the,

and, other, europeans, to, the, colony, where, they, worked, in, either, the, government, or, private, sectors, by, 1930, there, were, more, than, 240, 000, people, with, european, legal, status, in, the, colony, making, up, less, than, 0, 5, of, the, total, population, almost, 75, of, these, europeans, were, in, fact, native, eurasians, known, as, indo, europeans, the, dutch, colonialists, formed, a, privileged, upper, social, class, of, soldiers, administrators, managers, teachers, and, pioneers, they, lived, together, with, the, natives, but, at, the, top, of, a, rigid, social, and, racial, caste, system, the, dutch, east, indies, had, two, legal, classes, of, citizens, european, and, indigenous, a, third, class, foreign, easterners, was, added, in, 1920, in, 1901, the, dutch, adopted, what, they, called, the, ethical, policy, under, which, the, colonial, government, had, a, duty, to, further, the, welfare, of, the, indonesian, people, in, health, and, education, other, new, measures, under, the, policy, included, irrigation, programs, transmigration, communications, flood, mitigation, industrialisation, and, protection, of, native, industry, industrialisation, did, not, significantly, affect, the, majority, of, indonesians, and, indonesia, remained, an, agricultural, colony, by, 1930, there, were, 17, cities, with, populations, over, 50, 000, and, their, combined, populations, numbered, 1, 87, million, of, the, colony, s, 60, million, the, dutch, school, system, was, extended, to, indonesians, with, the, most, prestigious, schools, admitting, dutch, children, and, those, of, the, indonesian, upper, class, a, second, tier, of, schooling, was, based, on, ethnicity, with, separate, schools, for, indonesians, arabs, and, chinese, being, taught, in, dutch, and, with, a, dutch, curriculum, ordinary, indonesians, were, educated, in, malay, in, roman, alphabet, with, link, schools, preparing, bright, indonesian, students, for, entry, into, the, dutch, language, schools, vocational, schools, and, programs, were, set, up, by, the, indies, government, to, train, indigenous, indonesians, for, specific, roles, in, the, colonial, economy, chinese, and, arabs, officially, termed, foreign, orientals, could, not, enrol, in, either, the, vocational, schools, or, primary, schools, graduates, of, dutch, schools, opened, their, own, schools, modelled, on, the, dutch, school, system, as, did, christian, missionaries, theosophical, societies, and, indonesian, cultural, associations, this, proliferation, of, schools, was, further, boosted, by, new, muslim, schools, in, the, western, mould, that, also, offered, secular, subjects, according, to, the, 1930, census, 6, of, indonesians, were, literate, however, this, figure, recognised, only, graduates, from, western, schools, and, those, who, could, read, and, write, in, a, language, in, the, roman, alphabet, it, did, not, include, graduates, of, non, western, schools, or, those, who, could, read, but, not, write, arabic, malay, or, dutch, or, those, who, could, write, in, non, roman, alphabets, such, as, batak, javanese, chinese, or, arabic, some, higher, education, institutions, were, also, established, in, 1898, the, dutch, east, indies, government, established, a, school, to, train, medical, doctors, named, school, tot, opleiding, van, inlandsche, artsen, stovia, many, stovia, graduates, later, played, important, roles, in, indonesia, s, national, movement, toward, independence, as, well, in, developing, medical, education, in, indonesia, such, as, dr, wahidin, soedirohoesodo, who, established, the, budi, utomo, political, society, de, technische, hogeschool, te, bandung, was, established, in, 1920, by, the, dutch, colonial, administration, to, meet, the, needs, of, technical, resources, at, its, colony, one, technische, hogeschool, graduate, was, sukarno, whom, later, would, lead, the, indonesian, national, revolution, in, 1924, the, colonial, government, again, decided, to, open, a, new, tertiary, level, educational, facility, the, rechts, hogeschool, rhs, to, train, civilian, officers, and, servants, in, 1927, stovia, s, status, was, changed, to, that, of, a, full, tertiary, level, institution, and, its, name, was, changed, to, geneeskundige, hogeschool, ghs, the, ghs, occupied, the, same, main, building, and, used, the, same, teaching, hospital, as, the, current, faculty, of, medicine, of, university, of, indonesia, the, old, links, between, the, netherlands, and, indonesia, are, still, clearly, visible, in, such, technological, areas, as, irrigation, design, to, this, day, the, ideas, of, dutch, colonial, irrigation, engineers, continue, to, exert, a, strong, influence, over, indonesian, design, practices, moreover, the, two, highest, internationally, ranking, universities, of, indonesia, the, university, of, indonesia, established, in, 1898, and, the, bandung, institute, of, technology, established, in, 1920, were, both, founded, during, the, colonial, era, education, reforms, and, modest, political, reform, resulted, in, a, small, elite, of, highly, educated, indigenous, indonesians, who, promoted, the, idea, of, an, independent, and, unified, indonesia, that, would, bring, together, disparate, indigenous, groups, of, the, dutch, east, indies, a, period, termed, the, indonesian, national, revival, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, saw, the, nationalist, movement, develop, strongly, but, also, face, dutch, oppression, the, economic, history, of, the, colony, was, closely, related, to, the, economic, health, of, the, netherlands, despite, increasing, returns, from, the, dutch, system, of, land, tax, dutch, finances, had, been, severely, affected, by, the, cost, of, the, java, war, and, the, padri, war, and, the, dutch, loss, of, belgium, in, 1830, brought, the, netherlands, to, the, brink, of, bankruptcy, in, 1830, a, new, governor, general, johannes, van, den, bosch, was, appointed, to, exploit, the, indies, through, dutch, appropriation, of, its, resources, with, the, dutch, achieving, political, domination, throughout, java, for, the, first, time, in, 1830, it, was, possible, to, introduce, an, agricultural, policy, of, government, controlled, forced, cultivation, termed, cultuurstelsel, cultivation, system, in, dutch, and, tanam, paksa, forced, plantation, in, indonesia, farmers, were, required, to, deliver, as, a, form, of, tax, fixed, amounts, of, specified, crops, such, as, sugar, or, coffee, much, of, java, became, a, dutch, plantation, and, revenue, rose, continually, through, the, 19th, century, which, was, reinvested, into, the, netherlands, to, save, it, from, bankruptcy, between, 1830, and, 1870, 840, million, guilder, 8, billion, in, 2018, were, taken, from, the, east, indies, on, average, making, a, third, of, the, annual, dutch, government, budget, the, cultivation, system, however, brought, much, economic, hardship, to, javanese, peasants, who, suffered, famine, and, epidemics, in, the, 1840s, critical, public, opinion, in, the, netherlands, led, to, much, of, the, cultivation, system, s, excesses, being, eliminated, under, the, agrarian, reforms, of, the, liberal, period, according, to, one, study, the, mortality, rate, in, java, would, have, been, 10, 20, higher, by, the, late, 1870s, if, the, system, of, forced, labor, had, not, been, abolished, dutch, private, capital, flowed, in, after, 1850, especially, in, tin, mining, and, plantation, estate, agriculture, the, martavious, company, s, tin, mines, off, the, eastern, sumatra, coast, was, financed, by, a, syndicate, of, dutch, entrepreneurs, including, the, younger, brother, of, king, william, iii, mining, began, in, 1860, in, 1863, jacob, nienhuys, obtained, a, concession, from, the, sultanate, of, deli, east, sumatra, for, a, large, tobacco, estate, deli, company, from, 1870, the, indies, were, opened, up, to, private, enterprise, due, to, the, exploitation, of, chinese, migrant, labourers, or, coolies, dutch, businessmen, were, able, to, set, up, large, profitable, plantations, sugar, production, doubled, between, 1870, and, 1885, new, crops, such, as, tea, and, cinchona, flourished, and, rubber, was, introduced, leading, to, dramatic, increases, in, dutch, profits, changes, were, not, limited, to, java, or, agriculture, oil, from, sumatra, and, kalimantan, became, a, valuable, resource, for, industrialising, europe, dutch, commercial, interests, expanded, off, java, to, the, outer, islands, with, increasingly, more, territory, coming, under, direct, dutch, control, or, dominance, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, however, the, resulting, scarcity, of, land, for, rice, production, combined, with, dramatically, increasing, populations, especially, in, java, led, to, further, hardships, the, colonial, exploitation, of, indonesia, s, population, and, wealth, contributed, to, the, industrialisation, of, the, netherlands, while, simultaneously, laying, the, foundation, for, the, industrialisation, of, indonesia, the, dutch, introduced, coffee, tea, cacao, tobacco, and, rubber, and, large, expanses, of, java, became, plantations, cultivated, by, javanese, peasants, collected, by, chinese, intermediaries, and, sold, on, overseas, markets, by, european, merchants, in, the, late, 19th, century, economic, growth, was, based, on, heavy, world, demand, for, tea, coffee, and, cinchona, the, government, invested, heavily, in, a, railroad, network, 240, km, or, 150, mi, long, in, 1873, 1, 900, km, or, 1, 200, mi, in, 1900, as, well, as, telegraph, lines, and, entrepreneurs, opened, banks, shops, and, newspapers, the, dutch, east, indies, produced, most, of, the, world, s, supply, of, quinine, and, pepper, over, a, third, of, its, rubber, a, quarter, of, its, coconut, products, and, a, fifth, of, its, tea, sugar, coffee, and, oil, the, profit, from, the, dutch, east, indies, made, the, netherlands, one, of, the, world, s, most, significant, colonial, powers, the, koninklijke, paketvaart, maatschappij, shipping, line, supported, the, unification, of, the, colonial, economy, and, brought, inter, island, shipping, through, to, batavia, rather, than, through, singapore, thus, focusing, more, economic, activity, on, java, the, worldwide, recession, of, the, late, 1880s, and, early, 1890s, saw, the, commodity, prices, on, which, the, colony, depended, collapse, journalists, and, civil, servants, observed, that, the, majority, of, the, indies, population, were, no, better, off, than, under, the, previous, regulated, cultivation, system, economy, and, tens, of, thousands, starved, commodity, prices, recovered, from, the, recession,

exposed, to, indonesian, cuisine, and, as, a, result, they, developed, a, taste, for, native, tropical, spices, and, dishes, a, notable, dutch, east, indies, colonial, dish, is, rijsttafel, a, rice, table, consisting, of, 7, to, 40, popular, dishes, from, across, the, colony, more, an, extravagant, banquet, than, a, dish, the, dutch, colonials, introduced, the, rice, table, not, only, so, they, could, enjoy, a, wide, array, of, dishes, at, a, single, setting, but, also, to, impress, visitors, with, the, exotic, abundance, of, their, colony, throughout, the, colonial, period, the, dutch, introduced, european, dishes, such, as, bread, cheese, barbecued, steak, and, pancake, as, the, producer, of, cash, crops, coffee, and, tea, were, also, popular, in, the, colonial, east, indies,

of, upperclass, elite, of, dutch, east, indies, society, this, led, to, the, adoption, and, fusion, of, european, cuisine, into, indonesian, cuisine, some, dishes, which, were, created, during, the, colonial, era, are, dutch, influenced, they, include, selat, solo, solo, salad, bistik, jawa, javanese, beef, steak, semur, from, dutch, smoor, sayur, kacang, merah, brenebon, and, sop, buntut, cakes,

kaasstengels, cheese, cookies, kue, cubit, commonly, found, in, front, of, schools, and, marketplaces, are, believed, to, be, derived, from, poffertjes, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, arrivals, of, european, powers, in, indonesia, introduced, masonry, construction, to, indonesia, where, previously, timber, and, its, by, products, had, been, almost, exclusively, used, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, batavia, was, a, fortified, brick, and, masonry, city, for, almost, two, centuries, the, colonialists, did, little, to, adapt, their, european, architectural, habits, to, the, tropical, climate, they, built, row, houses, which, were, poorly, ventilated, with, small, windows, which, was, thought, as, protection, against, tropical, diseases, coming, from, tropical, air, years, later, the, dutch, had, learnt, to, adapt, their, architectural, styles, with, local, building, features, long, eaves, verandahs, porticos, large, windows, and, ventilation, openings, and, the, 18th, century, dutch, indies, country, houses, was, one, of, the, first, colonial, buildings, to, incorporate, indonesian, architectural, elements, and, adapt, to, the, climate, then, known, as, indies, style, from, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, significant, improvements, to, technology, communications, and, transportation, brought, new, wealth, to, java, modernistic, buildings, including, train, stations, business, hotels, factories, and, office, blocks, hospitals, and, education, institutions, were, influenced, by, international, styles, the, early, 20th, century, trend, was, for, modernist, influences, such, as, art, deco, being, expressed, in, essentially, european, buildings, with, indonesian, trim, practical, responses, to, the, environment, carried, over, from, the, earlier, indies, style, included, overhanging, eaves, larger, windows, and, ventilation, in, the, walls, which, gave, birth, to, the, new, indies, style, the, largest, stock, of, colonial, era, buildings, are, in, the, large, cities, of, java, such, as, bandung, jakarta, semarang, and, surabaya, notable, architects, and, planners, include, albert, aalbers, thomas, karsten, henri, maclaine, pont, j, gerber, and, c, p, w, schoemaker, in, the, first, three, decades, of, the, 20th, century, the, department, of, public, works, funded, major, public, buildings, and, introduced, a, town, planning, program, under, which, the, main, towns, and, cities, in, java, and, sumatra, were, rebuilt, and, extended, a, lack, of, development, in, the, great, depression, the, turmoil, of, the, second, world, war, and, the, indonesia, s, independence, struggle, of, the, 1940s, and, economic, stagnation, during, the, politically, turbulent, 1950s, and, 1960s, meant, that, much, colonial, architecture, has, been, preserved, through, to, recent, decades, colonial, homes, were, almost, always, the, preserve, of, the, wealthy, dutch, indonesian, and, chinese, elites, however, the, styles, were, often, rich, and, creative, combinations, of, two, cultures, so, much, so, that, the, homes, remain, sought, after, into, the, 21st, century, native, architecture, was, influenced, by, the, introduction, of, european, styles, and, western, elements, remain, an, influence, on, indonesia, s, contemporary, built, environment, within, the, colony, of, the, dutch, east, indies, fashion, played, an, important, role, to, define, ones, status, and, social, class, the, european, colonials, wore, european, fashion, straight, out, of, the, netherlands, or, even, paris, while, the, natives, wore, their, traditional, clothing, that, is, distinct, in, every, region, as, the, years, progressed, and, dutch, influence, became, stronger, many, natives, began, mixing, european, styles, within, their, traditional, clothing, high, ranking, natives, within, the, colony, as, well, as, nobility, would, wear, european, style, suits, with, their, batik, sarongs, for, special, occasions, and, even, for, everyday, use, increasingly, native, indonesians, began, to, dress, more, european, this, came, with, the, idea, that, those, who, wore, european, clothing, were, more, progressive, and, open, towards, a, european, society, and, the, etiquette, that, came, with, it, more, and, more, the, european, influence, was, gaining, precedence, within, native, indonesians, this, probably, stems, from, the, fact, that, many, natives, were, treated, better, if, they, wore, european, clothing, their, european, counterparts, acknowledged, them, and, that, in, turn, was, most, likely, a, catalyst, for, adoption, western, clothing, into, traditional, indonesian, clothing, the, fashion, influences, between, colonials, and, natives, were, a, reciprocal, phenomenon, just, as, the, europeans, influenced, the, natives, the, natives, too, influenced, the, european, colonials, for, example, the, thick, european, fabrics, was, considered, too, hot, to, wear, in, tropical, climate, thus, the, light, clothing, of, thin, kebaya, fabrics, and, the, comfortable, and, easy, to, wear, batik, sarong, were, considered, quite, suitable, for, everyday, clothing, in, hot, and, humid, climate, of, the, east, indies, though, the, dutch, typically, wore, european, clothes, for, more, formal, occasions, later, on, in, the, history, of, the, dutch, east, indies, as, a, new, wave, of, europeans, were, brought, into, the, colony, many, adopted, indonesian, styles, and, many, even, went, so, far, as, to, wear, traditional, javanese, kebaya, at, home, kebaya, and, batik, sarong, became, increasingly, popular, among, the, resident, dutch, over, time, though, the, dutch, distinguished, their, own, with, expensive, fabrics, and, european, patterns, batik, was, also, a, big, influence, for, the, dutch, the, technique, was, so, fascinating, to, them, that, they, brought, it, to, their, colonies, in, africa, where, it, was, adopted, with, african, patterns, football, experienced, significant, growth, in, the, dutch, east, indies, starting, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 19th, century, with, the, emergence, of, the, first, football, clubs, on, java, the, existence, of, city, championships, was, initially, documented, in, the, early, 1900s, coinciding, with, the, establishment, of, local, and, regional, football, federations, however, many, of, these, federations, were, short, lived, often, dissolving, shortly, after, their, formation, notably, the, dutch, east, indies, national, football, team, participated, in, the, 1938, world, cup, in, france, making, them, the, first, asian, country, to, participate, in, a, fifa, world, cup, however, their, journey, was, cut, short, in, the, first, round, as, they, suffered, a, 0, 6, defeat, against, the, hungary, national, football, team, at, v, lodrome, municipal, stadium, reims, france, when, the, dutch, royal, family, was, established, in, 1815, much, of, its, wealth, came, from, colonial, trade, universities, such, as, the, royal, leiden, university, founded, in, the, 16th, century, have, developed, into, leading, knowledge, centres, about, southeast, asian, and, indonesian, studies, leiden, university, has, produced, academics, such, as, colonial, adviser, christiaan, snouck, hurgronje, who, specialised, in, native, oriental, indonesian, affairs, and, it, still, has, academics, who, specialise, in, indonesian, languages, and, cultures, leiden, university, and, in, particular, kitlv, are, educational, and, scientific, institutions, that, to, this, day, share, both, an, intellectual, and, historical, interest, in, indonesian, studies, other, scientific, institutions, in, the, netherlands, include, the, amsterdam, tropenmuseum, an, anthropological, museum, with, massive, collections, of, indonesian, art, culture, ethnography, and, anthropology, the, traditions, of, the, knil, are, maintained, by, the, regiment, van, heutsz, of, the, modern, royal, netherlands, army, and, the, dedicated, bronbeek, museum, a, former, home, for, retired, knil, soldiers, exists, in, arnhem, to, this, day, many, surviving, colonial, families, and, their, descendants, who, moved, back, to, the, netherlands, after, independence, tended, to, look, back, on, the, colonial, era, with, a, sense, of, the, power, and, prestige, they, had, in, the, colony, with, such, items, as, the, 1970s, book, tempo, doeloe, old, times, by, author, rob, nieuwenhuys, and, other, books, and, materials, that, became, quite, common, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, moreover, since, the, 18th, century, dutch, literature, has, a, large, number, of, established, authors, such, as, louis, couperus, the, writer, of, the, hidden, force, taking, the, colonial, era, as, an, important, source, of, inspiration, in, fact, one, of, the, great, masterpieces, of, dutch, literature, is, the, book, max, havelaar, written, by, multatuli, in, 1860, as, criticism, of, exploitative, dutch, policies, in, java, the,
