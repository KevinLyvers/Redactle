babylonia, b, b, l, o, n, i, akkadian, m, t, akkad, was, an, ancient, akkadian, speaking, state, and, cultural, area, based, in, the, city, of, babylon, in, central, southern, mesopotamia, present, day, iraq, and, parts, of, syria, and, iran, it, emerged, as, an, akkadian, populated, but, amorite, ruled, state, c, 1894, bc, during, the, reign, of, hammurabi, and, afterwards, babylonia, was, retrospectively, called, the, country, of, akkad, m, t, akkad, in, akkadian, a, deliberate, archaism, in, reference, to, the, previous, glory, of, the, akkadian, empire, it, was, often, involved, in, rivalry, with, the, older, ethno, linguistically, related, state, of, assyria, in, the, north, of, mesopotamia, and, elam, to, the, east, in, ancient, iran, babylonia, briefly, became, the, major, power, in, the, region, after, hammurabi, fl, c, 1792, 1752, bc, middle, chronology, or, c, 1696, 1654, bc, short, chronology, created, a, short, lived, empire, succeeding, the, earlier, akkadian, empire, third, dynasty, of, ur, and, old, assyrian, empire, the, babylonian, empire, rapidly, fell, apart, after, the, death, of, hammurabi, and, reverted, to, a, small, kingdom, centered, around, the, city, of, babylon, like, assyria, the, babylonian, state, retained, the, written, akkadian, language, the, language, of, its, native, populace, for, official, use, despite, its, northwest, semitic, speaking, amorite, founders, and, kassite, successors, who, spoke, a, language, isolate, not, being, native, mesopotamians, it, retained, the, sumerian, language, for, religious, use, as, did, assyria, which, also, shared, the, same, mesopotamian, religion, as, babylonia, but, already, by, the, time, babylon, was, founded, this, was, no, longer, a, spoken, language, having, been, wholly, subsumed, by, akkadian, the, earlier, akkadian, and, sumerian, traditions, played, a, major, role, in, the, descendant, babylonian, and, assyrian, culture, and, the, region, would, remain, an, important, cultural, center, even, under, its, protracted, periods, of, outside, rule, mesopotamia, had, already, enjoyed, a, long, history, before, the, emergence, of, babylon, with, sumerian, civilization, emerging, in, the, region, c, 5400, bc, and, the, akkadian, speakers, who, would, go, on, to, form, akkad, assyria, and, babylonia, appearing, somewhere, between, the, 35th, and, 30th, century, bc, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, an, intimate, cultural, symbiosis, occurred, between, sumerian, and, akkadian, speakers, which, included, widespread, bilingualism, the, influence, of, sumerian, on, akkadian, and, vice, versa, is, evident, in, all, areas, from, lexical, borrowing, on, a, massive, scale, to, syntactic, morphological, and, phonological, convergence, this, has, prompted, scholars, to, refer, to, sumerian, and, akkadian, in, the, third, millennium, as, a, sprachbund, akkadian, gradually, replaced, sumerian, as, the, spoken, language, of, mesopotamia, somewhere, around, the, turn, of, the, third, and, the, second, millennium, bc, the, precise, timeframe, being, a, matter, of, debate, from, c, 5400, bc, until, the, rise, of, the, akkadian, empire, in, the, 24th, century, bc, mesopotamia, had, been, dominated, by, largely, sumerian, cities, and, city, states, such, as, ur, lagash, uruk, kish, isin, larsa, adab, eridu, gasur, assur, hamazi, akshak, arbela, and, umma, although, semitic, akkadian, names, began, to, appear, on, the, king, lists, of, some, of, these, states, such, as, eshnunna, and, assyria, between, the, 29th, and, 25th, centuries, bc, traditionally, the, major, religious, center, of, all, mesopotamia, was, the, city, of, nippur, where, the, god, enlil, was, supreme, and, it, would, remain, so, until, replaced, by, babylon, during, the, reign, of, hammurabi, in, the, mid, 18th, century, bc, the, akkadian, empire, 2334, 2154, bc, saw, the, akkadian, semites, and, sumerians, of, mesopotamia, unite, under, one, rule, and, the, akkadians, fully, attain, ascendancy, over, the, sumerians, and, indeed, come, to, dominate, much, of, the, ancient, near, east, the, empire, eventually, disintegrated, due, to, economic, decline, climate, change, and, civil, war, followed, by, attacks, by, the, language, isolate, speaking, gutians, from, the, zagros, mountains, to, the, northeast, sumer, rose, up, again, with, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, neo, sumerian, empire, in, the, late, 22nd, century, bc, and, ejected, the, gutians, from, southern, mesopotamia, in, 2161, bc, as, suggested, by, surviving, tablets, and, astronomy, simulations, they, also, seem, to, have, gained, ascendancy, over, much, of, the, territory, of, the, akkadian, speaking, kings, of, assyria, in, northern, mesopotamia, for, a, time, followed, by, the, collapse, of, the, sumerian, ur, iii, dynasty, at, the, hands, of, the, elamites, in, 2002, bc, the, amorites, westerners, a, foreign, northwest, semitic, speaking, people, began, to, migrate, into, southern, mesopotamia, from, the, northern, levant, gradually, gaining, control, over, most, of, southern, mesopotamia, where, they, formed, a, series, of, small, kingdoms, while, the, assyrians, reasserted, their, independence, in, the, north, the, states, of, the, south, were, unable, to, stem, the, amorite, advance, and, for, a, time, may, have, relied, on, their, fellow, akkadians, in, assyria, for, protection, king, ilu, shuma, c, 2008, 1975, bc, of, the, old, assyrian, period, 2025, 1750, bc, in, a, known, inscription, describes, his, exploits, to, the, south, as, follows, the, freedom, of, the, akkadians, and, their, children, i, established, i, purified, their, copper, i, established, their, freedom, from, the, border, of, the, marshes, and, ur, and, nippur, awal, and, kish, der, of, the, goddess, ishtar, as, far, as, the, city, of, ashur, past, scholars, originally, extrapolated, from, this, text, that, it, means, he, defeated, the, invading, amorites, to, the, south, and, elamites, to, the, east, but, there, is, no, explicit, record, of, that, and, some, scholars, believe, the, assyrian, kings, were, merely, giving, preferential, trade, agreements, to, the, south, these, policies, whether, military, economic, or, both, were, continued, by, his, successors, erishum, i, and, ikunum, however, when, sargon, i, 1920, 1881, bc, succeeded, as, king, in, assyria, in, 1920, bc, he, eventually, withdrew, assyria, from, the, region, preferring, to, concentrate, on, continuing, the, vigorous, expansion, of, assyrian, colonies, in, anatolia, at, the, expense, of, the, hurrians, and, hattians, and, the, amorite, inhabited, levant, and, eventually, southern, mesopotamia, fell, to, the, amorites, during, the, first, centuries, of, what, is, called, the, amorite, period, the, most, powerful, city, states, in, the, south, were, isin, eshnunna, and, larsa, together, with, assyria, in, the, north, around, 1894, bc, an, amorite, chieftain, named, sumu, abum, appropriated, a, tract, of, land, which, included, the, then, relatively, small, city, of, babylon, from, the, neighbouring, minor, city, state, of, kazallu, of, which, it, had, initially, been, a, territory, turning, his, newly, acquired, lands, into, a, state, in, its, own, right, his, reign, was, concerned, with, establishing, statehood, amongst, a, sea, of, other, minor, city, states, and, kingdoms, in, the, region, however, sumu, abum, appears, never, to, have, bothered, to, give, himself, the, title, of, king, of, babylon, suggesting, that, babylon, itself, was, still, only, a, minor, town, or, city, and, not, worthy, of, kingship, he, was, followed, by, sumu, la, el, sabium, and, apil, sin, each, of, whom, ruled, in, the, same, vague, manner, as, sumu, abum, with, no, reference, to, kingship, of, babylon, itself, being, made, in, any, written, records, of, the, time, sin, muballit, was, the, first, of, these, amorite, rulers, to, be, regarded, officially, as, a, king, of, babylon, and, then, on, only, one, single, clay, tablet, under, these, kings, babylonia, remained, a, small, nation, which, controlled, very, little, territory, and, was, overshadowed, by, neighbouring, kingdoms, that, were, both, older, larger, and, more, powerful, such, as, isin, larsa, assyria, to, the, north, and, elam, to, the, east, in, ancient, iran, the, elamites, occupied, huge, swathes, of, southern, mesopotamia, and, the, early, amorite, rulers, were, largely, held, in, vassalage, to, elam, babylon, remained, a, minor, town, in, a, small, state, until, the, reign, of, its, sixth, amorite, ruler, hammurabi, during, 1792, 1750, bc, or, c, 1728, 1686, bc, in, the, short, chronology, he, conducted, major, building, work, in, babylon, expanding, it, from, a, small, town, into, a, great, city, worthy, of, kingship, a, very, efficient, ruler, he, established, a, bureaucracy, with, taxation, and, centralized, government, hammurabi, freed, babylon, from, elamite, dominance, and, indeed, drove, the, elamites, from, southern, mesopotamia, entirely, invading, elam, itself, he, then, systematically, conquered, southern, mesopotamia, including, the, cities, of, isin, larsa, eshnunna, kish, lagash, nippur, borsippa, ur, uruk, umma, adab, sippar, rapiqum, and, eridu, his, conquests, gave, the, region, stability, after, turbulent, times, and, coalesced, the, patchwork, of, small, states, into, a, single, nation, it, is, only, from, the, time, of, hammurabi, that, southern, mesopotamia, acquired, the, name, babylonia, hammurabi, turned, his, disciplined, armies, eastwards, and, invaded, the, region, which, a, thousand, years, later, became, iran, conquering, elam, gutium, lullubi, turukku, and, kassites, to, the, west, he, conquered, the, amorite, states, of, the, levant, modern, syria, and, jordan, including, the, powerful, kingdoms, of, mari, and, yamhad, hammurabi, then, entered, into, a, protracted, war, with, the, old, assyrian, empire, for, control, of, mesopotamia, and, dominance, of, the, near, east, assyria, had, extended, control, over, much, of, the, hurrian, and, hattian, parts, of, southeast, anatolia, from, the, 21st, century, bc, and, from, the, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, bc, had, asserted, itself, over, the, northeast, levant, and, central, mesopotamia, after, a, protracted, struggle, over, decades, with, the, powerful, assyrian, kings, shamshi, adad, i, and, ishme, dagan, i, hammurabi, forced, their, successor, mut, ashkur, to, pay, tribute, to, babylon, c, 1751, bc, giving, babylonia, control, over, assyria, s, centuries, old, hattian, and, hurrian, colonies, in, anatolia, one, of, hammurabi, s, most, important, and, lasting, works, was, the, compilation, of, the, babylonian, law, code, which, improved, the, much, earlier, codes, of, sumer, akkad, and, assyria, this, was, made, by, order, of, hammurabi, after, the, expulsion, of, the, elamites, and, the, settlement, of, his, kingdom, in, 1901, a, copy, of, the, code, of, hammurabi, was, discovered, on, a, stele, by, jacques, de, morgan, and, jean, vincent, scheil, at, susa, in, elam, where, it, had, later, been, taken, as, plunder, that, copy, is, now, in, the, louvre, from, before, 3000, bc, until, the, reign, of, hammurabi, the, major, cultural, and, religious, center, of, southern, mesopotamia, had, been, the, ancient, city, of, nippur, where, the, god, enlil, was, supreme, hammurabi, transferred, this, dominance, to, babylon, making, marduk, supreme, in, the, pantheon, of, southern, mesopotamia, with, the, god, ashur, and, to, some, degree, ishtar, remaining, the, long, dominant, deity, in, northern, mesopotamian, assyria, the, city, of, babylon, became, known, as, a, holy, city, where, any, legitimate, ruler, of, southern, mesopotamia, had, to, be, crowned, and, the, city, was, also, revered, by, assyria, for, these, religious, reasons, hammurabi, turned, what, had, previously, been, a, minor, administrative, town, into, a, large, powerful, and, influential, city, extended, its, rule, over, the, entirety, of, southern, mesopotamia, and, erected, a, number, of, buildings, the, amorite, ruled, babylonians, like, their, predecessor, states, engaged, in, regular, trade, with, the, amorite, and, canaanite, city, states, to, the, west, with, babylonian, officials, or, troops, sometimes, passing, to, the, levant, and, canaan, and, amorite, merchants, operating, freely, throughout, mesopotamia, the, babylonian, monarchy, s, western, connections, remained, strong, for, quite, some, time, ammi, ditana, great, grandson, of, hammurabi, still, titled, himself, king, of, the, land, of, the, amorites, ammi, ditana, s, father, and, son, also, bore, amorite, names, abi, eshuh, and, ammi, saduqa, southern, mesopotamia, had, no, natural, defensible, boundaries, making, it, vulnerable, to, attack, after, the, death, of, hammurabi, his, empire, began, to, disintegrate, rapidly, under, his, successor, samsu, iluna, 1749, 1712, bc, the, far, south, of, mesopotamia, was, lost, to, a, native, akkadian, speaking, king, ilum, ma, ili, who, ejected, the, amorite, ruled, babylonians, the, south, became, the, native, sealand, dynasty, remaining, free, of, babylon, for, the, next, 272, years, both, the, babylonians, and, their, amorite, rulers, were, driven, from, assyria, to, the, north, by, an, assyrian, akkadian, governor, named, puzur, sin, c, 1740, bc, who, regarded, king, mut, ashkur, as, both, a, foreign, amorite, and, a, former, lackey, of, babylon, after, six, years, of, civil, war, in, assyria, a, native, king, named, adasi, seized, power, c, 1735, bc, and, went, on, to, appropriate, former, babylonian, and, amorite, territory, in, central, mesopotamia, as, did, his, successor, bel, bani, amorite, rule, survived, in, a, much, reduced, babylon, samshu, iluna, s, successor, abi, eshuh, made, a, vain, attempt, to, recapture, the, sealand, dynasty, for, babylon, but, met, defeat, at, the, hands, of, king, damqi, ilishu, ii, by, the, end, of, his, reign, babylonia, had, shrunk, to, the, small, and, relatively, weak, nation, it, had, been, upon, its, foundation, although, the, city, itself, was, far, larger, and, opulent, than, the, small, town, it, had, been, prior, to, the, rise, of, hammurabi, he, was, followed, by, ammi, ditana, and, then, ammi, saduqa, both, of, whom, were, in, too, weak, a, position, to, make, any, attempt, to, regain, the, many, territories, lost, after, the, death, of, hammurabi, contenting, themselves, with, peaceful, building, projects, in, babylon, itself, samsu, ditana, was, to, be, the, last, amorite, ruler, of, babylon, early, in, his, reign, he, came, under, pressure, from, the, kassites, a, people, speaking, an, apparent, language, isolate, originating, in, the, mountains, of, what, is, today, northwest, iran, babylon, was, then, attacked, by, the, indo, european, speaking, anatolia, based, hittites, in, 1595, bc, shamshu, ditana, was, overthrown, following, the, sack, of, babylon, by, the, hittite, king, mursili, i, the, hittites, did, not, remain, for, long, but, the, destruction, wrought, by, them, finally, enabled, their, kassite, allies, to, gain, control, the, date, of, the, sack, of, babylon, by, the, hittites, under, king, mursili, i, is, considered, crucial, to, the, various, calculations, of, the, early, chronology, of, the, ancient, near, east, as, it, is, taken, as, a, fixed, point, in, the, discussion, suggestions, for, its, precise, date, vary, by, as, much, as, 230, years, corresponding, to, the, uncertainty, regarding, the, length, of, the, dark, age, of, the, much, later, late, bronze, age, collapse, resulting, in, the, shift, of, the, entire, bronze, age, chronology, of, mesopotamia, with, regard, to, the, egyptian, chronology, possible, dates, for, the, sack, of, babylon, are, mursili, i, the, hittite, king, first, conquered, aleppo, capital, of, yamhad, kingdom, to, avenge, the, death, of, his, father, but, his, main, geopolitical, target, was, babylon, the, mesopotamian, chronicle, 40, written, after, 1500, bc, mentions, briefly, the, sack, of, babylon, as, during, the, time, of, samsu, ditana, the, hittites, marched, on, akkad, more, details, can, be, found, in, another, source, the, telepinu, proclamation, a, hittite, text, from, around, 1520, bc, which, states, and, then, he, marched, to, aleppo, and, he, destroyed, aleppo, and, brought, captives, and, possessions, of, aleppo, to, attu, a, then, however, he, marched, to, babylon, and, he, destroyed, babylon, and, he, defeated, the, hurrian, troops, and, he, brought, captives, and, possessions, of, babylon, to, attu, a, the, movement, of, mursili, s, troops, was, around, 800, km, from, the, conquered, aleppo, to, reach, the, euphrates, located, to, the, east, skirting, around, assyria, and, then, to, the, south, along, the, course, of, the, river, to, reach, finally, babylon, his, conquest, of, babylon, brought, to, an, end, the, dynasty, of, hammurabi, and, although, the, hittite, text, telipinu, proclamation, does, not, mention, samsu, ditana, and, the, babylonian, chronicle, 20, does, not, mention, a, specific, hittite, king, either, trevor, bryce, concludes, that, there, is, no, doubt, that, both, sources, refer, to, mursili, i, and, samsu, ditana, the, hittites, when, sacking, babylon, removed, the, images, of, the, gods, marduk, and, his, consort, zarpanitu, from, the, esagil, temple, and, they, took, them, to, their, kingdom, the, later, inscription, of, agum, kakrime, the, kassite, king, claims, he, returned, the, images, and, another, later, text, the, marduk, prophesy, written, long, after, the, events, mentions, that, the, image, of, marduk, was, in, exile, around, twenty, four, years, after, the, conquest, mursili, i, did, not, attempt, to, convert, the, whole, region, he, had, occupied, from, aleppo, to, babylon, as, a, part, of, his, kingdom, he, instead, made, an, alliance, with, the, kassites, and, then, a, kassite, dynasty, was, established, in, babylonia, the, kassite, dynasty, was, founded, by, gandash, of, mari, the, kassites, like, the, amorite, rulers, who, had, preceded, them, were, not, originally, native, to, mesopotamia, rather, they, had, first, appeared, in, the, zagros, mountains, of, what, is, today, northwestern, iran, the, ethnic, affiliation, of, the, kassites, is, unclear, still, their, language, was, not, semitic, or, indo, european, and, is, thought, to, have, been, either, a, language, isolate, or, possibly, related, to, the, hurro, urartian, language, family, of, anatolia, although, the, evidence, for, its, genetic, affiliation, is, meager, due, to, the, scarcity, of, extant, texts, that, said, several, kassite, leaders, may, have, borne, indo, european, names, and, they, may, have, had, an, indo, european, elite, similar, to, the, mitanni, elite, that, later, ruled, over, the, hurrians, of, central, and, eastern, anatolia, while, others, had, semitic, names, the, kassites, renamed, babylon, kardunia, and, their, rule, lasted, for, 576, years, the, longest, dynasty, in, babylonian, history, this, new, foreign, dominion, offers, a, striking, analogy, to, the, roughly, contemporary, rule, of, the, semitic, hyksos, in, ancient, egypt, most, divine, attributes, ascribed, to, the, amorite, kings, of, babylonia, disappeared, at, this, time, the, title, god, was, never, given, to, a, kassite, sovereign, babylon, continued, to, be, the, capital, of, the, kingdom, and, one, of, the, holy, cities, of, western, asia, where, the, priests, of, the, ancient, mesopotamian, religion, were, all, powerful, and, the, only, place, where, the, right, to, inheritance, of, the, short, lived, old, babylonian, empire, could, be, conferred, babylonia, experienced, short, periods, of, relative, power, but, in, general, proved, to, be, relatively, weak, under, the, long, rule, of, the, kassites, and, spent, long, periods, under, assyrian, and, elamite, domination, and, interference, it, is, not, clear, precisely, when, kassite, rule, of, babylon, began, but, the, indo, european, hittites, from, anatolia, did, not, remain, in, babylonia, for, long, after, the, sacking, of, the, city, and, it, is, likely, the, kassites, moved, in, soon, afterwards, agum, ii, took, the, throne, for, the, kassites, in, 1595, bc, and, ruled, a, state, that, extended, from, iran, to, the, middle, euphrates, the, new, king, retained, peaceful, relations, with, erishum, iii, the, native, mesopotamian, king, of, assyria, but, successfully, went, to, war, with, the, hittite, empire, and, twenty, four, years, after, the, hittites, took, the, sacred, statue, of, marduk, he, recovered, it, and, declared, the, god, equal, to, the, kassite, deity, shuqamuna, burnaburiash, i, succeeded, him, and, drew, up, a, peace, treaty, with, the, assyrian, king, puzur, ashur, iii, and, had, a, largely, uneventful, reign, as, did, his, successor, kashtiliash, iii, the, sealand, dynasty, of, southern, mesopotamia, remained, independent, of, babylonia, and, like, assyria, was, in, native, akkadian, speaking, hands, ulamburiash, managed, to, attack, it, and, conquered, parts, of, the, land, from, ea, gamil, a, king, with, a, distinctly, sumerian, name, around, 1450, bc, whereupon, ea, gamil, fled, to, his, allies, in, elam, the, sealand, dynasty, region, still, remained, independent, and, the, kassite, king, seems, to, have, been, unable, to, finally, conquer, it, ulamburiash, began, making, treaties, with, ancient, egypt, which, then, was, ruling, southern, canaan, and, assyria, to, the, north, agum, iii, also, campaigned, against, the, sealand, dynasty, finally, wholly, conquering, the, far, south, of, mesopotamia, for, babylon, destroying, its, capital, dur, enlil, in, the, process, from, there, agum, iii, extended, farther, south, still, invading, what, was, many, centuries, later, to, be, called, the, arabian, peninsula, or, arabia, and, conquering, the, pre, arab, state, of, dilmun, in, modern, bahrain, karaindash, built, a, bas, relief, temple, in, uruk, and, kurigalzu, i, 1415, 1390, bc, built, a, new, capital, dur, kurigalzu, named, after, himself, transferring, administrative, rule, from, babylon, both, of, these, kings, continued, to, struggle, unsuccessfully, against, the, sealand, dynasty, karaindash, also, strengthened, diplomatic, ties, with, the, assyrian, king, ashur, bel, nisheshu, and, the, egyptian, pharaoh, thutmose, iii, and, protected, babylonian, borders, with, elam, kada, man, arbe, i, succeeded, karaindash, and, briefly, invaded, elam, before, being, eventually, defeated, and, ejected, by, its, king, tepti, ahar, he, then, had, to, contend, with, the, suteans, ancient, semitic, speaking, peoples, from, the, southeastern, levant, who, invaded, babylonia, and, sacked, uruk, he, describes, having, annihilated, their, extensive, forces, then, constructed, fortresses, in, a, mountain, region, called, i, i, in, the, desert, to, the, west, modern, syria, as, security, outposts, and, he, dug, wells, and, settled, people, on, fertile, lands, to, strengthen, the, guard, kurigalzu, i, succeeded, the, throne, and, soon, came, into, conflict, with, elam, to, the, east, when, ur, batila, the, successor, of, tepti, ahar, took, the, throne, of, elam, he, began, raiding, the, babylonia, taunting, kurigalzu, to, do, battle, with, him, at, d, r, ulgi, kurigalzu, launched, a, campaign, which, resulted, in, the, abject, defeat, and, capture, of, ur, batila, who, appears, in, no, other, inscriptions, he, went, on, to, conquer, the, eastern, lands, of, elam, this, took, his, army, to, the, elamite, capital, the, city, of, susa, which, was, sacked, after, this, a, puppet, ruler, was, placed, on, the, elamite, throne, subject, to, babylonia, kurigalzu, i, maintained, friendly,

enlil, kudurri, usur, from, retaking, babylonia, which, apart, from, its, northern, reaches, had, mostly, shrugged, off, assyrian, domination, during, a, short, period, of, civil, war, in, the, assyrian, empire, in, the, years, after, the, death, of, tukulti, ninurta, meli, shipak, ii, 1188, 1172, bc, seems, to, have, had, a, peaceful, reign, despite, not, being, able, to, regain, northern,

isin, with, the, first, native, akkadian, speaking, south, mesopotamian, dynasty, to, rule, babylonia, with, marduk, kabit, ahheshu, becoming, only, the, second, native, mesopotamian, to, sit, on, the, throne, of, babylon, after, the, assyrian, king, tukulti, ninurta, i, his, dynasty, was, to, remain, in, power, for, some, 125, years, the, new, king, successfully, drove, out, the, elamites, and, prevented, any, possible, kassite, revival, later, in, his, reign, he, went, to, war, with, assyria, and, had, some, initial, success, briefly, capturing, the, south, assyrian, city, of,

took, the, throne, in, 1127, bc, and, also, attempted, an, invasion, of, assyria, his, armies, seem, to, have, skirted, through, eastern, aramea, modern, syria, and, then, made, an, attempt, to, attack, the, assyrian, city, of, arbela, modern, erbil, from, the, west, however, this, bold, move, met, with, defeat, at, the, hands, of, ashur, resh, ishi, i, who, then, forced, a, treaty, in, his, favour, upon, the, babylonian, king, nebuchadnezzar, i, 1124, 1103, bc, was, the, most, famous, ruler, of, this, dynasty, he, fought, and, defeated, the, elamites, and, drove, them, from, babylonian,

them, marduk, nadin, ahhe, 1098, 1081, bc, also, went, to, war, with, assyria, some, initial, success, in, these, conflicts, gave, way, to, a, catastrophic, defeat, at, the, hands, of, the, powerful, assyrian, king, tiglath, pileser, i, 1115, 1076, bc, who, annexed, huge, swathes, of, babylonian, territory, thus, further, expanding, the, assyrian, empire, following, this, a, terrible, famine,

treaty, with, ashur, bel, kala, 1075, 1056, bc, of, assyria, however, his, successor, kada, man, buria, was, not, so, friendly, to, assyria, prompting, the, assyrian, king, to, invade, babylonia, and, depose, him, placing, adad, apla, iddina, on, the, throne, as, his, vassal, assyrian, domination, continued, until, c, 1050, bc, with, marduk, ahhe, eriba, and, marduk, zer, x, regarded, as, vassals, of, assyria, after, 1050, bc, the, middle, assyrian, empire, descended, into, a, period, of, civil, war, followed, by, constant, warfare, with, the, arameans, phrygians, neo, hittite, states, and, hurrians, allowing, babylonia, to, once, more, largely, free, itself, from, the, assyrian, yoke, for, a, few, decades, however, east, semitic, speaking, babylonia, soon, began, to, suffer, further, repeated, incursions, from, west, semitic, nomadic, peoples, migrating, from, the, levant, during, the, bronze, age, collapse, and, during, the, 11th, century, bc, large, swathes, of, the, babylonian,

suteans, in, the, western, deserts, with, the, weak, babylonian, kings, being, unable, to, stem, these, migrations, the, ruling, babylonian, dynasty, of, nabu, shum, libur, was, deposed, by, marauding, arameans, in, 1026, bc, and, the, heart, of, babylonia, including, the, capital, city, itself, descended, into, anarchic, state, and, no, king, was, to, rule, babylon, for, over, 20, years, however, in, southern, mesopotamia, a, region, corresponding, with, the, old, dynasty, of, the, sealand, dynasty, v, 1025, 1004, bc, arose, this, was, ruled, by, simbar, shipak, leader, of, a, kassite, clan, and, was, in, effect, a, separate, state, from, babylon, the, state, of, anarchy, allowed, the, assyrian, ruler, ashur, nirari, iv, 1019, 1013, bc, the, opportunity, to, attack, babylonia, in, 1018, bc, and, he, invaded, and, captured, the, babylonian, city, of, atlila, and, some, south, central, regions, of, mesopotamia, for, assyria, the, south, mesopotamian, dynasty, was, replaced, by, another, kassite, dynasty, dynasty, vi, 1003, 984, bc, which, also, seems, to, have, regained, control, over, babylon, itself, the, elamites, deposed, this, brief, kassite, revival, with, king, mar, biti, apla, usur, founding, dynasty, vii, 984, 977, bc, however, this, dynasty, too, fell, when, the, arameans, once, more, ravaged, babylon, babylonian, rule, was, restored, by, nab,

areas, of, babylonia, now, under, firm, aramean, and, sutean, control, babylonian, rulers, were, often, forced, to, bow, to, pressure, from, assyria, and, elam, both, of, which, had, appropriated, babylonian, territory, babylonia, remained, in, a, state, of, chaos, as, the, 10th, century, bc, drew, to, a, close, a, further, migration, of, nomads, from, the, levant, occurred, in, the, early, 9th, century, bc, with, the, arrival, of, the, chaldeans, another, nomadic, northwest, semitic, speaking, people, described, in, assyrian, annals, as, the, kaldu, the, chaldeans, settled, in, the, far, southeast, of, babylonia, joining, the, already, long, extant, arameans, and, suteans, by, 850, bc, the, migrant, chaldeans, had, established, a, small, territory, in, the, extreme, southeast, of, mesopotamia, from, 911, bc, with, the, founding, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 605, bc, by, adad, nirari, ii, babylon, found, itself, once, again, under, the, domination, and, rule, of, its, fellow, mesopotamian, state, for, the, next, three, centuries, adad, nirari, ii, twice, attacked, and, defeated, shamash, mudammiq, of, babylonia, annexing, a, large, area, of, land, north, of, the, diyala, river, and, the, towns, of, h, t, and, zanqu, in, mid, mesopotamia, he, made, further, gains, over, babylonia, under, nabu, shuma, ukin, i, later, in, his, reign, tukulti, ninurta, ii, and, ashurnasirpal, ii, also, forced, babylonia, into, vassalage, and, shalmaneser, iii, 859, 824, bc, sacked, babylon, itself, slew, king, nabu, apla, iddina, subjugated, the, aramean, sutean, and, chaldean, tribes, settled, within, babylonia, and, installed, marduk, zakir, shumi, i, 855, 819, bc, followed, by, marduk, balassu, iqbi, 819, 813, bc, as, his, vassals, it, was, during, the, late, 850, s, bc, in, the, annals, of, shalmaneser, iii, that, the, chaldeans, and, arabs, dwelling, in, some, northern, regions, of, the, arabian, peninsula, are, first, mentioned, in, the, pages, of, written, recorded, history, upon, the, death, of, shalmaneser, ii, baba, aha, iddina, was, reduced, to, vassalage, by, the, assyrian, queen, shammuramat, known, as, semiramis, to, the, persians, armenians, and, greeks, acting, as, regent, to, his, successor, adad, nirari, iii, who, was, merely, a, boy, adad, nirari, iii, eventually, killed, baba, aha, iddina, and, ruled, there, directly, until, 800, bc, until, ninurta, apla, x, was, crowned, however, he, too, was, subjugated, by, adad, nirari, iii, the, next, assyrian, king, shamshi, adad, v, then, made, a, vassal, of, marduk, bel, zeri, babylonia, briefly, fell, to, another, foreign, ruler, when, marduk, apla, usur, ascended, the, throne, in, 780, bc, taking, advantage, of, a, period, of, civil, war, in, assyria, he, was, a, member, of, the, chaldean, tribe, who, had, a, century, or, so, earlier, settled, in, a, small, region, in, the, far, southeastern, corner, of, mesopotamia, bordering, the, persian, gulf, and,

throughout, the, land, the, babylonian, king, nabonassar, overthrew, the, chaldean, usurpers, in, 748, bc, and, successfully, stabilised, babylonia, remaining, untroubled, by, ashur, nirari, v, of,

babylon, directly, as, its, king, instead, of, allowing, babylonian, kings, to, remain, as, vassals, of, assyria, as, his, predecessors, had, done, for, two, hundred, years, it, was, during, this, period, that, eastern, aramaic, was, introduced, by, the, assyrians, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, and, the, still, spoken, by, assyrians, and, mandeans, mesopotamian, aramaic, began, to, slowly, overlay, and, supplant, akkadian, as, the, spoken, language, of, the, general, populace, of, both, assyria, and, babylonia, the, assyrian, king, shalmaneser, v, was,

the, infuriated, assyrian, king, sennacherib, to, invade, and, subjugate, elam, and, to, sack, babylon, laying, waste, to, the, region, and, largely, destroying, the, city, while, praying, to, the,

from, cyprus, to, persia, and, the, caspian, sea, he, installed, his, eldest, son, shamash, shum, ukin, as, a, subject, king, in, babylon, and, his, youngest, the, highly, educated, ashurbanipal, 669, 627, bc, in, the, more, senior, position, as, king, of, assyria, and, overlord, of, shamash, shum, ukin, despite, being, an, assyrian, himself, shamash, shum, ukin, after, decades, subject, to, his, brother, ashurbanipal, declared, that, the, city, of, babylon, and, not, the, assyrian, city, of, nineveh, should, be, the, seat, of, the, immense, empire, he, raised, a, major, revolt, against, his, brother, ashurbanipal, he, led, a, powerful, coalition, of, peoples, also, resentful, of, assyrian, subjugation, and, rule, including, elam, the, persians, medes, the, babylonians, chaldeans, and, suteans, of, southern, mesopotamia, the, arameans, of, the, levant, and, southwest, mesopotamia, the, arabs, and, dilmunites, of, the, arabian, peninsula, and, the, canaanites, phoenicians, after, a, bitter, struggle, babylon, was, sacked, and, its, allies, vanquished, shamash, shum, ukim, being, killed, in, the, process, elam, was, destroyed, once, and, for, all, and, the, babylonians, persians, chaldeans, arabs, medes, elamites, arameans, suteans, and, canaanites, were, violently, subjugated, with, assyrian, troops, exacting, savage, revenge, on, the, rebelling, peoples, an, assyrian, governor, named, kandalanu, was, placed, on, the, throne, to, rule, on, behalf, of, the, assyrian, king, upon, ashurbanipal, s, death, in, 627, bc, his, son, ashur, etil, ilani, 627, 623, bc, became, ruler, of, babylon, and, assyria, however, assyria, soon, descended, into, a, series, of, brutal, internal, civil, wars, which, were, to, cause, its, downfall, ashur, etil, ilani, was, deposed, by, one, of, his, own, generals, named, sin, shumu, lishir, in, 623, bc, who, also, set, himself, up, as, king, in, babylon, after, only, one, year, on, the, throne, amidst, continual, civil, war, sinsharishkun, 622, 612, bc, ousted, him, as, ruler, of, assyria, and, babylonia, in, 622, bc, however, he, too, was, beset, by, constant, unremitting, civil, war, in, the, assyrian, heartland, babylonia, took, advantage, of, this, and, rebelled, under, nabopolassar, a, previously, unknown, malka, chieftain, of, the, chaldeans, who, had, settled, in, southeastern, mesopotamia, by, c, 850, bc, it, was, during, the, reign, of, sin, shar, ishkun, that, assyria, s, vast, empire, began, to, unravel, and, many, of, its, former, subject, peoples, ceased, to, pay, tribute, most, significantly, for, the, assyrians, the, babylonians, chaldeans, medes, persians, scythians, arameans, and, cimmerians, in, 620, bc, nabopolassar, seized, control, over, much, of, babylonia, with, the, support, of, most, of, the, inhabitants, with, only, the, city, of, nippur, and, some, northern, regions, showing, any, loyalty, to, the, beleaguered, assyrian, king, nabopolassar, was, unable, to, utterly, secure, babylonia, and, for, the, next, four, years, he, was, forced, to, contend, with, an, occupying, assyrian, army, encamped, in, babylonia, trying, to, unseat, him, however, the, assyrian, king, sin, shar, ishkun, was, plagued, by, constant, revolts, among, his, people, in, nineveh, and, was, thus, prevented, from, ejecting, nabopolassar, the, stalemate, ended, in, 615, bc, when, nabopolassar, entered, the, babylonians, and, chaldeans, into, alliance, with, cyaxares, an, erstwhile, vassal, of, assyria, and, king, of, the, iranian, peoples, the, medes, persians, sagartians, and, parthians, cyaxares, had, also, taken, advantage, of, the, assyrian, destruction, of, the, formerly, regionally, dominant, pre, iranian, elamite, and, mannean, nations, and, the, subsequent, anarchy, in, assyria, to, free, the, iranic, peoples, from, three, centuries, of, the, assyrian, yoke, and, regional, elamite, domination, the, scythians, from, north, of, the, caucasus, and, the, cimmerians, from, the, black, sea, who, had, both, also, been, subjugated, by, assyria, joined, the, alliance, as, did, regional, aramean, tribes, in, 615, bc, while, the, assyrian, king, was, fully, occupied, fighting, rebels, in, both, babylonia, and, assyria, itself, cyaxares, launched, a, surprise, attack, on, the, assyrian, heartlands, sacking, the, cities, of, kalhu, the, biblical, calah, nimrud, and, arrapkha, modern, kirkuk, nabopolassar, was, still, pinned, down, in, southern, mesopotamia, and, thus, not, involved, in, this, breakthrough, from, this, point, on, the, coalition, of, babylonians, chaldeans, medes, persians, scythians, cimmerians, and, sagartians, fought, in, unison, against, a, civil, war, ravaged, assyria, major, assyrian, cities, such, as, ashur, arbela, modern, irbil, guzana, dur, sharrukin, modern, khorsabad, imgur, enlil, nibarti, ashur, gasur, kanesh, kar, ashurnasipal, and, tushhan, fell, to, the, alliance, during, 614, bc, sin, shar, ishkun, somehow, managed, to, rally, against, the, odds, during, 613, bc, and, drove, back, the, combined, forces, ranged, against, him, however, the, alliance, launched, a, renewed, combined, attack, the, following, year, and, after, five, years, of, fierce, fighting, nineveh, was, sacked, in, late, 612, bc, after, a, prolonged, siege, in, which, sin, shar, ishkun, was, killed, defending, his, capital, house, to, house, fighting, continued, in, nineveh, and, an, assyrian, general, and, member, of, the, royal, household, took, the, throne, as, ashur, uballit, ii, 612, 605, bc, he, was, offered, the, chance, of, accepting, a, position, of, vassalage, by, the, leaders, of, the, alliance, according, to, the, babylonian, chronicle, however, he, refused, and, managed, to, successfully, fight, his, way, out, of, nineveh, and, to, the, northern, assyrian, city, of, harran, in, upper, mesopotamia, where, he, founded, a, new, capital, the, fighting, continued, as, the, assyrian, king, held, out, against, the, alliance, until, 607, bc, when, he, was, eventually, ejected, by, the, medes, babylonians, scythians, and, their, allies, and, prevented, in, an, attempt, to, regain, the, city, the, same, year, the, egyptian, pharaoh, necho, ii, whose, dynasty, had, been, installed, as, vassals, of, assyria, in, 671, bc, belatedly, tried, to, aid, egypt, s, former, assyrian, masters, possibly, out, of, fear, that, egypt, would, be, next, to, succumb, to, the, new, powers, without, assyria, to, protect, them, having, already, been, ravaged, by, the, scythians, the, assyrians, fought, on, with, egyptian, aid, until, what, was, probably, a, final, decisive, victory, was, achieved, against, them, at, carchemish, in, northwestern, assyria, in, 605, bc, the, seat, of, empire, was, thus, transferred, to, babylonia, for, the, first, time, since, hammurabi, over, a, thousand, years, before, nabopolassar, was, followed, by, his, son, nebuchadnezzar, ii, 605, 562, bc, whose, reign, of, 43, years, made, babylon, once, more, the, ruler, of, much, of, the, civilized, world, taking, over, portions, of, the, former, assyrian, empire, with, the, eastern, and, northeastern, portion, being, taken, by, the, medes, and, the, far, north, by, the, scythians, nebuchadnezzar, ii, may, have, also, had, to, contend, with, remnants, of, the, assyrian, resistance, some, sections, of, the, assyrian, army, and, administration, may, have, still, continued, in, and, around, dur, katlimmu, in, northwest, assyria, for, a, time, however, by, 599, bc, assyrian, imperial, records, from, this, region, also, fell, silent, the, fate, of, ashur, uballit, ii, remains, unknown, and, he, may, have, been, killed, attempting, to, regain, harran, at, carchemish, or, continued, to, fight, on, eventually, disappearing, into, obscurity, the, scythians, and, cimmerians, erstwhile, allies, of, babylonia, under, nabopolassar, now, became, a, threat, and, nebuchadnezzar, ii, was, forced, to, march, into, anatolia, and, rout, their, forces, ending, the, northern, threat, to, his, empire, the, egyptians, attempted, to, remain, in, the, near, east, possibly, in, an, effort, to, aid, in, restoring, assyria, as, a, secure, buffer, against, babylonia, and, the, medes, and, persians, or, to, carve, out, an, empire, of, their, own, nebuchadnezzar, ii, campaigned, against, the, egyptians, and, drove, them, back, over, the, sinai, however, an, attempt, to, take, egypt, itself, as, his, assyrian, predecessors, had, succeeded, in, doing, failed, mainly, due, to, a, series, of, rebellions, from, the, israelites, of, judah, and, the, former, kingdom, of, ephraim, the, phoenicians, of, caanan, and, the, arameans, of, the, levant, the, babylonian, king, crushed, these, rebellions, deposed, jehoiakim, the, king, of, judah, and, deported, a, sizeable, part, of, the, population, to, babylonia, cities, like, tyre, sidon, and, damascus, were, also, subjugated, the, arabs, and, other, south, arabian, peoples, who, dwelt, in, the, deserts, to, the, south, of, the, borders, of, mesopotamia, were, then, also, subjugated, in, 567, bc, he, went, to, war, with, pharaoh, amasis, and, briefly, invaded, egypt, itself, after, securing, his, empire, which, included, marrying, a, median, princess, he, devoted, himself, to, maintaining, the, empire, and, conducting, numerous, impressive, building, projects, in, babylon, he, is, credited, with, building, the, fabled, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, amel, marduk, succeeded, to, the, throne, and, reigned, for, only, two, years, little, contemporary, record, of, his, rule, survives, though, berosus, later, stated, that, he, was, deposed, and, murdered, in, 560, bc, by, his, successor, neriglissar, for, conducting, himself, in, an, improper, manner, neriglissar, 560, 556, bc, also, had, a, short, reign, he, was, the, son, in, law, of, nebuchadnezzar, ii, and, it, is, unclear, if, he, was, a, chaldean, or, native, babylonian, who, married, into, the, dynasty, he, campaigned, in, aram, and, phoenicia, successfully, maintaining, babylonian, rule, in, these, regions, neriglissar, died, young, however, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, labashi, marduk, 556, bc, who, was, still, a, boy, he, was, deposed, and, killed, during, the, same, year, in, a, palace, conspiracy, of, the, reign, of, the, last, babylonian, king, nabonidus, nabu, na, id, 556, 539, bc, who, is, the, son, of, the, assyrian, priestess, adda, guppi, and, who, managed, to, kill, the, last, chaldean, king, labashi, marduk, and, took, the, reign, there, is, a, fair, amount, of, information, available, nabonidus, hence, his, son, the, regent, belshazzar, was, at, least, from, the, mother, s, side, neither, chaldean, nor, babylonian, but, ironically, assyrian, hailing, from, its, final, capital, of, harran, kharranu, his, father, s, origins, remain, unknown, information, regarding, nabonidus, is, chiefly, derived, from, a, chronological, tablet, containing, the, annals, of, nabonidus, supplemented, by, another, inscription, of, nabonidus, where, he, recounts, his, restoration, of, the, temple, of, the, moon, god, sin, at, harran, as, well, as, by, a, proclamation, of, cyrus, issued, shortly, after, his, formal, recognition, as, king, of, babylonia, a, number, of, factors, arose, which, would, ultimately, lead, to, the, fall, of, babylon, the, population, of, babylonia, became, restive, and, increasingly, disaffected, under, nabonidus, he, excited, a, strong, feeling, against, himself, by, attempting, to, centralize, the, polytheistic, religion, of, babylonia, in, the, temple, of, marduk, at, babylon, and, while, he, had, thus, alienated, the, local, priesthoods, the, military, party, also, despised, him, on, account, of, his, antiquarian, tastes, he, seemed, to, have, left, the, defense, of, his, kingdom, to, his, son, belshazzar, a, capable, soldier, but, poor, diplomat, who, alienated, the, political, elite, occupying, himself, with, the, more, congenial, work, of, excavating, the, foundation, records, of, the, temples, and, determining, the, dates, of, their, builders, he, also, spent, time, outside, babylonia, rebuilding, temples, in, the, assyrian, city, of, harran, and, also, among, his, arab, subjects, in, the, deserts, to, the, south, of, mesopotamia, nabonidus, and, belshazzar, s, assyrian, heritage, is, also, likely, to, have, added, to, this, resentment, in, addition, mesopotamian, military, might, had, usually, been, concentrated, in, the, martial, state, of, assyria, babylonia, had, always, been, more, vulnerable, to, conquest, and, invasion, than, its, northern, neighbour, and, without, the, might, of, assyria, to, keep, foreign, powers, in, check, and, mesopotamia, dominant, babylonia, was, ultimately, exposed, it, was, in, the, sixth, year, of, nabonidus, 549, bc, that, cyrus, the, great, the, achaemenid, persian, king, of, anshan, in, elam, revolted, against, his, suzerain, astyages, king, of, the, manda, or, medes, at, ecbatana, astyages, army, betrayed, him, to, his, enemy, and, cyrus, established, himself, at, ecbatana, thus, putting, an, end, to, the, empire, of, the, medes, and, making, the, persian, faction, dominant, among, the, iranic, peoples, three, years, later, cyrus, had, become, king, of, all, persia, and, was, engaged, in, a, campaign, to, put, down, a, revolt, among, the, assyrians, meanwhile, nabonidus, had, established, a, camp, in, the, desert, of, his, colony, of, arabia, near, the, southern, frontier, of, his, kingdom, leaving, his, son, belshazzar, belsharutsur, in, command, of, the, army, in, 539, bc, cyrus, invaded, babylonia, a, battle, was, fought, at, opis, in, the, month, of, june, where, the, babylonians, were, defeated, and, immediately, afterwards, sippar, surrendered, to, the, invader, nabonidus, fled, to, babylon, where, he, was, pursued, by, gobryas, and, on, the, 16th, day, of, tammuz, two, days, after, the, capture, of, sippar, the, soldiers, of, cyrus, entered, babylon, without, fighting, nabonidus, was, dragged, from, his, hiding, place, where, the, services, continued, without, interruption, cyrus, did, not, arrive, until, the, 3rd, of, marchesvan, october, gobryas, having, acted, for, him, in, his, absence, gobryas, was, now, made, governor, of, the, province, of, babylon, and, a, few, days, afterwards, belshazzar, the, son, of, nabonidus, died, in, battle, a, public, mourning, followed, lasting, six, days, and, cyrus, son, cambyses, accompanied, the, corpse, to, the, tomb, one, of, the, first, acts, of, cyrus, accordingly, was, to, allow, the, jewish, exiles, to, return, to, their, own, homes, carrying, with, them, their, sacred, temple, vessels, the, permission, to, do, so, was, embodied, in, a, proclamation, whereby, the, conqueror, endeavored, to, justify, his, claim, to, the, babylonian, throne, cyrus, now, claimed, to, be, the, legitimate, successor, of, the, ancient, babylonian, kings, and, the, avenger, of, bel, marduk, who, was, assumed, to, be, wrathful, at, the, impiety, of, nabonidus, in, removing, the, images, of, the, local, gods, from, their, ancestral, shrines, to, his, capital, babylon, the, chaldean, tribe, had, lost, control, of, babylonia, decades, before, the, end, of, the, era, that, sometimes, bears, their, name, and, they, appear, to, have, blended, into, the, general, populace, of, babylonia, even, before, this, for, example, nabopolassar, nebuchadnezzar, ii, and, their, successors, always, referred, to, themselves, as, shar, akkad, and, never, as, shar, kaldu, on, inscriptions, and, during, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, the, term, chaldean, ceased, to, refer, to, a, race, of, people, and, instead, specifically, to, a, social, class, of, priests, educated, in, classical, babylonian, literature, particularly, astronomy, and, astrology, by, the, mid, seleucid, empire, 312, 150, bc, period, this, term, too, had, fallen, from, use, babylonia, was, absorbed, into, the, achaemenid, empire, in, 539, bce, becoming, the, satrapy, of, babirush, old, persian, romanized, b, biru, a, year, before, cyrus, death, in, 529, bce, he, elevated, his, son, cambyses, ii, in, the, government, making, him, king, of, babylon, he, reserved, for, himself, the, fuller, title, of, king, of, the, other, provinces, of, the, empire, it, was, only, when, darius, i, acquired, the, persian, throne, and, ruled, it, as, a, representative, of, the, zoroastrian, religion, that, the, old, tradition, was, broken, and, the, claim, of, babylon, to, confer, legitimacy, on, the, rulers, of, west, asia, ceased, to, be, acknowledged, immediately, after, darius, seized, persia, babylonia, briefly, recovered, its, independence, under, a, native, ruler, nidinta, bel, who, took, the, name, of, nebuchadnezzar, iii, and, reigned, from, october, 522, bc, to, august, 520, bc, when, darius, took, the, city, by, storm, during, this, period, assyria, to, the, north, also, rebelled, a, few, years, later, probably, 514, bc, babylon, again, revolted, under, the, urartian, king, nebuchadnezzar, iv, on, this, occasion, after, its, capture, by, the, persians, the, walls, were, partly, destroyed, the, esagila, the, great, temple, of, marduk, however, still, continued, to, be, kept, in, repair, and, to, be, a, center, of, babylonian, religious, feelings, alexander, the, great, conquered, babylon, in, 333, bce, for, the, greeks, and, died, there, in, 323, bce, babylonia, and, assyria, then, became, part, of, the, greek, seleucid, empire, it, has, long, been, maintained, that, the, foundation, of, seleucia, diverted, the, population, to, the, new, capital, of, lower, mesopotamia, and, that, the, ruins, of, the, old, city, became, a, quarry, for, the, builders, of, the, new, seat, of, government, but, the, recent, publication, of, the, babylonian, chronicles, has, shown, that, urban, life, was, still, very, much, the, same, well, into, the, parthian, empire, 150, bce, to, 226, ce, the, parthian, king, mithridates, conquered, the, region, into, the, parthian, empire, in, 150, bc, and, the, region, became, something, of, a, battleground, between, greeks, and, parthians, there, was, a, brief, interlude, of, roman, conquest, the, provinces, of, assyria, and, mesopotamia, 116, 118, ad, under, trajan, after, which, the, parthians, reasserted, control, the, satrapy, of, babylonia, was, absorbed, into, as, rist, n, middle, persian, for, the, land, of, assyria, in, the, sasanian, empire, which, began, in, 226, ce, and, by, this, time, east, syriac, rite, christianity, which, emerged, in, assyria, and, upper, mesopotamia, the, first, century, had, become, the, dominant, religion, among, the, assyrian, people, who, had, never, adopted, the, zoroastrianism, or, hellenistic, religion, or, the, languages, of, their, rulers, apart, from, the, small, 2nd, century, bc, to, 3rd, century, independent, neo, assyrian, states, of, adiabene, osroene, assur, beth, garmai, beth, nuhadra, and, hatra, in, the, north, mesopotamia, remained, under, largely, persian, control, until, the, arab, muslim, conquest, of, persia, in, the, seventh, century, ad, as, rist, n, was, dissolved, as, a, geopolitical, entity, in, 637, and, the, native, eastern, aramaic, speaking, and, largely, christian, populace, of, southern, and, central, mesopotamia, with, the, exception, of, the, mandeans, gradually, underwent, arabization, and, islamization, in, contrast, to, northern, mesopotamia, where, an, assyrian, continuity, endures, to, the, present, day, bronze, age, to, early, iron, age, mesopotamian, culture, is, sometimes, summarized, as, assyro, babylonian, because, of, the, close, ethnic, linguistic, and, cultural, interdependence, of, the, two, political, centers, the, term, babylonia, especially, in, writings, from, around, the, early, 20th, century, was, formerly, used, to, also, include, southern, mesopotamia, s, earliest, pre, babylonian, history, and, not, only, in, reference, to, the, later, city, state, of, babylon, proper, this, geographic, usage, of, the, name, babylonia, has, generally, been, replaced, by, the, more, accurate, term, sumer, or, sumero, akkadian, in, more, recent, writing, referring, to, the, pre, assyro, babylonian, mesopotamian, civilization, in, babylonia, an, abundance, of, clay, and, lack, of, stone, led, to, greater, use, of, mudbrick, babylonian, sumerian, and, assyrian, temples, were, massive, structures, of, crude, brick, which, were, supported, by, buttresses, the, rain, being, carried, off, by, drains, one, such, drain, at, ur, was, made, of, lead, the, use, of, brick, led, to, the, early, development, of, the, pilaster, and, column, and, of, frescoes, and, enameled, tiles, the, walls, were, brilliantly, coloured, and, sometimes, plated, with, zinc, or, gold, as, well, as, with, tiles, painted, terracotta, cones, for, torches, were, also, embedded, in, the, plaster, in, babylonia, in, place, of, the, relief, there, was, greater, use, of, three, dimensional, figures, the, earliest, examples, being, the, statues, of, gudea, that, are, realistic, if, somewhat, clumsy, the, paucity, of, stone, in, babylonia, made, every, pebble, precious, and, led, to, a, high, perfection, in, the, art, of, gem, cutting, tablets, dating, back, to, the, old, babylonian, period, document, the, application, of, mathematics, to, the, variation, in, the, length, of, daylight, over, a, solar, year, centuries, of, babylonian, observations, of, celestial, phenomena, are, recorded, in, the, series, of, cuneiform, script, tablets, known, as, the, en, ma, anu, enlil, the, oldest, significant, astronomical, text, that, we, possess, is, tablet, 63, of, en, ma, anu, enlil, the, venus, tablet, of, ammi, saduqa, which, lists, the, first, and, last, visible, risings, of, venus, over, a, period, of, about, 21, years, and, is, the, earliest, evidence, that, the, phenomena, of, a, planet, were, recognized, as, periodic, the, oldest, rectangular, astrolabe, dates, back, to, babylonia, c, 1100, bc, the, mul,

water, clock, gnomon, shadows, and, intercalations, the, babylonian, gu, text, arranges, stars, in, strings, that, lie, along, declination, circles, and, thus, measure, right, ascensions, or, time, intervals, and, also, employs, the, stars, of, the, zenith, which, are, also, separated, by, given, right, ascensional, differences, medical, diagnosis, and, prognosis, we, find, in, a, whole, constellation, of, disciplines, there, was, a, real, common, ground, among, these, forms, of, knowledge, an, approach, involving, analysis, of, particular, cases, constructed, only, through, traces, symptoms, hints, in, short, we, can, speak, about, a, symptomatic, or, divinatory, paradigm, which, could, be, oriented, toward, past, present, or, future, depending, on, the, form, of, knowledge, called, upon, toward, future, that, was, the, medical, science, of, symptoms, with, its, double, character, diagnostic, explaining, past, and, present, and, prognostic, suggesting, likely, future, the, oldest, babylonian, i, e, akkadian, texts, on, medicine, date, back, to, the, first, babylonian, dynasty, in, the, first, half, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, although, the, earliest, medical, prescriptions, appear, in, sumerian, during, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, period, the, most, extensive, babylonian, medical, text, however, is, the, diagnostic, handbook, written, by, the, umm, n, or, chief, scholar, esagil, kin, apli, of, borsippa, during, the, reign, of, the, babylonian, king, adad, apla, iddina, 1069, 1046, bc, along, with, contemporary, ancient, egyptian, medicine, the, babylonians, introduced, the, concepts, of, diagnosis, prognosis, physical, examination, and, prescriptions, in, addition, the, diagnostic, handbook, introduced, the, methods, of, therapy, and, aetiology, and, the, use, of, empiricism, logic, and, rationality, in, diagnosis, prognosis, and, therapy, the, text, contains, a, list, of, medical, symptoms, and, often, detailed, empirical, observations, along, with, logical, rules, used, in, combining, observed, symptoms, on, the, body, of, a, patient, with, its, diagnosis, and, prognosis, the, symptoms, and, diseases, of, a, patient, were, treated, through, therapeutic, means, such, as, bandages, creams, and, pills, if, a, patient, could, not, be, cured, physically, the, babylonian, physicians, often, relied, on, exorcism, to, cleanse, the, patient, from, any, curses, esagil, kin, apli, s, diagnostic, handbook, was, based, on, a, logical, set, of, axioms, and, assumptions, including, the, modern, view, that, through, the, examination, and, inspection, of, the, symptoms, of, a, patient, it, is, possible, to, determine, the, patient, s, disease, its, aetiology, and, future, development, and, the, chances, of, the, patient, s, recovery, esagil, kin, apli, discovered, a, variety, of, illnesses, and, diseases, and, described, their, symptoms, in, his, diagnostic, handbook, these, include, the, symptoms, for, many, varieties, of, epilepsy, and, related, ailments, along, with, their, diagnosis, and, prognosis, later, babylonian, medicine, resembles, early, greek, medicine, in, many, ways, in, particular, the, early, treatises, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, show, the, influence, of, late, babylonian, medicine, in, terms, of, both, content, and, form, there, were, libraries, in, most, towns, and, temples, an, old, sumerian, proverb, averred, that, he, who, would, excel, in, the, school, of, the, scribes, must, rise, with, the, dawn, women, as, well, as, men, learned, to, read, and, write, and, in, semitic, times, this, involved, knowledge, of, the, extinct, sumerian, language, and, a, complicated, and, extensive, syllabary, a, considerable, amount, of, babylonian, literature, was, translated, from, sumerian, originals, and, the, language, of, religion, and, law, long, continued, to, be, written, in, the, old, agglutinative, language, of, sumer, vocabularies, grammars, and, interlinear, translations, were, compiled, for, the, use, of, students, as, well, as, commentaries, on, the, older, texts, and, explanations, of, obscure, words, and, phrases, the, characters, of, the, syllabary, were, all, arranged, and, named, and, elaborate, lists, of, them, were, drawn, up, there, are, many, babylonian, literary, works, whose, titles, have, come, down, to, us, one, of, the, most, famous, of, these, was, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, in, twelve, books, translated, from, the, original, sumerian, by, a, certain, sin, liqi, unninni, and, arranged, upon, an, astronomical, principle, each, division, contains, the, story, of, a, single, adventure, in, the, career, of, gilgamesh, the, whole, story, is, a, composite, product, and, it, is, probable, that, some, of, the, stories, are, artificially, attached, to, the, central, figure, the, brief, resurgence, of, babylonian, culture, in, the, 7th, to, 6th, centuries, bc, was, accompanied, by, a, number, of, important, cultural, developments, among, the, sciences, astronomy, and, astrology, still, occupied, a, conspicuous, place, in, babylonian, society, astronomy, was, of, old, standing, in, babylonia, the, zodiac, was, a, babylonian, invention, of, great, antiquity, and, eclipses, of, the, sun, and, moon, could, be, foretold, there, are, dozens, of, cuneiform, records, of, original, mesopotamian, eclipse, observations, babylonian, astronomy, was, the, basis, for, much, of, what, was, done, in, ancient, greek, astronomy, in, classical, in, sasanian, byzantine, and, syrian, astronomy, astronomy, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, and, in, central, asian, and, western, european, astronomy, neo, babylonian, astronomy, can, thus, be, considered, the, direct, predecessor, of, much, of, ancient, greek, mathematics, and, astronomy, which, in, turn, is, the, historical, predecessor, of, the, european, western, scientific, revolution, during, the, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bc, babylonian, astronomers, developed, a, new, approach, to, astronomy, they, began, studying, philosophy, dealing, with, the, ideal, nature, of, the, early, universe, and, began, employing, an, internal, logic, within, their, predictive, planetary, systems, this, was, an, important, contribution, to, astronomy, and, the, philosophy, of, science, and, some, scholars, have, thus, referred, to, this, new, approach, as, the, first, scientific, revolution, this, new, approach, to, astronomy, was, adopted, and, further, developed, in, greek, and, hellenistic, astronomy, in, seleucid, and, parthian, times, the, astronomical, reports, were, of, a, thoroughly, scientific, character, how, much, earlier, their, advanced, knowledge, and, methods, were, developed, is, uncertain, the, babylonian, development, of, methods, for, predicting, the, motions, of, the, planets, is, considered, to, be, a, major, episode, in, the, history, of, astronomy, the, only, babylonian, astronomer, known, to, have, supported, a, heliocentric, model, of, planetary, motion, was, seleucus, of, seleucia, b, 190, bc, seleucus, is, known, from, the, writings, of, plutarch, he, supported, the, heliocentric, theory, where, the, earth, rotated, around, its, own, axis, which, in, turn, revolved, around, the, sun, according, to, plutarch, seleucus, even, proved, the, heliocentric, system, but, it, is, not, known, what, arguments, he, used, babylonian, mathematical, texts, are, plentiful, and, well, edited, in, respect, of, time, they, fall, in, two, distinct, groups, one, from, the, first, babylonian, dynasty, period, 1830, 1531, bc, the, other, mainly, seleucid, from, the, last, three, or, four, centuries, bc, in, respect, of, content, there, is, scarcely, any, difference, between, the, two, groups, of, texts, thus, babylonian, mathematics, remained, stale, in, character, and, content, with, very, little, progress, or, innovation, for, nearly, two, millennia, the, babylonian, system, of, mathematics, was, sexagesimal, or, a, base, 60, numeral, system, from, this, we, derive, the, modern, day, usage, of, 60, seconds, in, a, minute, 60, minutes, in, an, hour, and, 360, 60, 6, degrees, in, a, circle, the, babylonians, were, able, to, make, great, advances, in, mathematics, for, two, reasons, first, the, number, 60, has, many, divisors, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and, 30, making, calculations, easier, additionally, unlike, the, egyptians, and, romans, the, babylonians, had, a, true, place, value, system, where, digits, written, in, the, left, column, represented, larger, values, much, as, in, our, base, ten, system, 734, 7, 100, 3, 10, 4, 1, among, the, babylonians, mathematical, accomplishments, were, the, determination, of, the, square, root, of, two, correctly, to, seven, places, ybc, 7289, they, also, demonstrated, knowledge, of, the, pythagorean, theorem, well, before, pythagoras, as, evidenced, by, this, tablet, translated, by, dennis, ramsey, and, dating, to, c, 1900, bc, 4, is, the, length, and, 5, is, the, diagonal, what, is, the, breadth, its, size, is, not, known, 4, times, 4, is, 16, and, 5, times, 5, is, 25, you, take, 16, from, 25, and, there, remains, 9, what, times, what, shall, i, take, in, order, to, get, 9, 3, times, 3, is, 9, 3, is, the, breadth, the, ner, of, 600, and, the, sar, of, 3600, were, formed, from, the, unit, of, 60, corresponding, with, a, degree, of, the, equator, tablets, of, squares, and, cubes, calculated, from, 1, to, 60, have, been, found, at, senkera, and, a, people, acquainted, with, the, sun, dial, the, clepsydra, the, lever, and, the, pulley, must, have, had, no, mean, knowledge, of, mechanics, a, crystal, lens, turned, on, the, lathe, was, discovered, by, austen, henry, layard, at, nimrud, along, with, glass, vases, bearing, the, name, of, sargon, this, could, explain, the, excessive, minuteness, of, some, of, the, writing, on, the, assyrian, tablets, and, a, lens, may, also, have, been, used, in, the, observation, of, the, heavens, the, babylonians, might, have, been, familiar, with, the, general, rules, for, measuring, the, areas, they, measured, the, circumference, of, a, circle, as, three, times, the, diameter, and, the, area, as, one, twelfth, the, square, of, the, circumference, which, would, be, correct, if, were, estimated, as, 3, the, volume, of, a, cylinder, was, taken, as, the, product, of, the, base, and, the, height, however, the, volume, of, the, frustum, of, a, cone, or, a, square, pyramid, was, incorrectly, taken, as, the, product, of, the, height, and, half, the, sum, of, the, bases, also, there, was, a, recent, discovery, in, which, a, tablet, used, as, 3, and, 1, 8, the, babylonians, are, also, known, for, the, babylonian, mile, which, was, a, measure, of, distance, equal, to, about, 11, kilometres, 7, mi, today, this, measurement, for, distances, eventually, was, converted, to, a, time, mile, used, for, measuring, the, travel, of, the, sun, therefore, representing, time, eves, chapter, 2, the, babylonians, used, also, space, time, graphs, to, calculate, the, velocity, of, jupiter, this, is, an, idea, that, is, considered, highly, modern, traced, to, the, 14th, century, england, and, france, and, anticipating, integral, calculus, the, origins, of, babylonian, philosophy, can, be, traced, back, to, early, mesopotamian, wisdom, literature, which, embodied, certain, philosophies, of, life, particularly, ethics, in, the, forms, of, dialectic, dialogs, epic, poetry, folklore, hymns, lyrics, prose, and, proverbs, babylonian, reasoning, and, rationality, developed, beyond, empirical, observation, it, is, possible, that, babylonian, philosophy, had, an, influence, on, greek, philosophy, particularly, hellenistic, philosophy, the, babylonian, text, dialogue, of, pessimism, contains, similarities, to, the, agonistic, thought, of, the, sophists, the, heraclitean, doctrine, of, contrasts, and, the, dialogs, of, plato, as, well, as, a, precursor, to, the, maieutic, socratic, method, of, socrates, the, milesian, philosopher, thales, is, also, known, to, have, studied, philosophy, in, mesopotamia, according, to, the, assyriologist, marc, van, de, mieroop, babylonian, philosophy, was, a, highly, developed, system, of, thought, with, a, unique, approach, to, knowledge, and, a, focus, on, writing, lexicography, divination, and, law, it, was, also, a, bilingual, intellectual, culture, based, on, sumerian, and, akkadian, babylonia, and, particularly, its, capital, city, babylon, has, long, held, a, place, in, the, abrahamic, religions, as, a, symbol, of, excess, and, dissolute, power, many, references, are, made, to, babylon, in, the, bible, both, literally, historical, and, allegorically, the, mentions, in, the, tanakh, tend, to, be, historical, or, prophetic, while, new, testament, apocalyptic, references, to, the, whore, of, babylon, are, more, likely, figurative, or, cryptic, references, possibly, to, pagan, rome, or, some, other, archetype, the, legendary, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, and, the, tower, of, babel, are, seen, as, symbols, of, luxurious, and, arrogant, power, respectively, early, christians, sometimes, referred, to, rome, as, babylon, for, instance, the, writer, of, the, first, epistle, of, peter, concludes, his, letter, with, this, advice, she, who, is, in, babylon, chosen, together, with, you, sends, you, her, greetings, and, so, does, my, son, mark, 1, peter, 5, 13, revelation, 14, 8, says, a, second, angel, followed, and, said, fallen, fallen, is, babylon, the, great, which, made, all, the, nations, drink, the, maddening, wine, of, her, adulteries, other, examples, can, be, found, in, revelation, 16, 19, and, revelation, 18, 2, babylon, is, mentioned, in, the, quran, in, verse, 102, of, chapter, 2, of, surah, baqarah, the, cow, they, instead, followed, the, magic, promoted, by, the, devils, during, the, reign, of, solomon, never, did, solomon, disbelieve, rather, the, devils, disbelieved, they, taught, magic, to, the, people, along, with, what, had, been, revealed, to, the, two, angels, h, r, t, and, m, r, t, in, babylon, the, two, angels, never, taught, anyone, without, saying, we, are, only, a, test, for, you, so, do, not, abandon, your, faith, yet, people, learned, magic, that, caused, a, rift, even, between, husband, and, wife, although, their, magic, could, not, harm, anyone, except, by, allah, s, will, they, learned, what, harmed, them, and, did, not, benefit, them, although, they, already, knew, that, whoever, buys, into, magic, would, have, no, share, in, the, hereafter, miserable, indeed, was, the, price, for, which, they, sold, their, souls, if, only, they, knew
