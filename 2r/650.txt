the, history, of, communication, technologies, media, and, appropriate, inscription, tools, have, evolved, in, tandem, with, shifts, in, political, and, economic, systems, and, by, extension, systems, of, power, communication, can, range, from, very, subtle, processes, of, exchange, to, full, conversations, and, mass, communication, the, history, of, communication, itself, can, be, traced, back, since, the, origin, of, speech, circa, 100, 000, bce, the, use, of, technology, in, communication, may, be, considered, since, the, first, use, of, symbols, about, 30, 000, years, bce, among, the, symbols, used, there, are, cave, paintings, petroglyphs, pictograms, and, ideograms, writing, was, a, major, innovation, as, well, as, printing, technology, and, more, recently, telecommunications, and, the, internet, human, communication, was, initiated, with, the, origin, of, speech, approximately, 100, 000, bce, symbols, were, developed, about, 30, 000, years, ago, the, imperfection, of, speech, allowed, easier, dissemination, of, ideas, and, eventually, resulted, in, the, creation, of, new, forms, of, communication, improving, both, the, range, at, which, people, could, communicate, and, the, longevity, of, the, information, all, of, those, inventions, were, based, on, the, key, concept, of, the, symbol, the, oldest, known, symbols, created, for, communication, were, cave, paintings, a, form, of, rock, art, dating, to, the, upper, paleolithic, age, the, oldest, known, cave, painting, is, located, within, chauvet, cave, dated, to, around, 30, 000, bce, these, paintings, contained, increasing, amounts, of, information, people, may, have, created, the, first, calendar, as, far, back, as, 15, 000, years, ago, the, connection, between, drawing, and, writing, is, further, shown, by, linguistics, in, ancient, egypt, and, ancient, greece, the, concepts, and, words, of, drawing, and, writing, were, the, same, egyptian, s, sh, greek, graphein, the, next, advancement, in, the, history, of, communications, came, with, the, production, of, petroglyphs, carvings, into, a, rock, surface, it, took, about, 20, 000, years, for, homo, sapiens, to, move, from, the, first, cave, paintings, to, the, first, petroglyphs, dated, to, approximately, the, neolithic, and, late, upper, paleolithic, boundary, about, 10, 000, to, 12, 000, years, ago, the, petroglyphs, of, the, hawaiian, islands, were, associated, with, several, kinds, of, symbolism, myths, legends, and, art, it, is, possible, that, homo, sapiens, humans, of, that, time, used, some, other, forms, of, communication, often, for, mnemonic, purposes, specially, arranged, stones, symbols, carved, in, wood, or, earth, quipu, like, rocks, tattoos, but, little, other, than, the, most, durable, carved, stones, has, survived, to, modern, times, and, we, can, only, speculate, about, their, existence, based, on, our, observation, of, still, existing, hunter, gatherer, cultures, such, as, those, of, africa, or, oceania, a, pictogram, pictograph, is, a, symbol, representing, a, concept, object, activity, place, or, event, by, illustration, pictography, is, a, form, of, proto, writing, whereby, ideas, are, transmitted, through, drawing, pictographs, were, the, next, step, in, the, evolution, of, communication, the, most, important, difference, between, petroglyphs, and, pictograms, is, that, petroglyphs, are, simply, showing, an, event, but, pictograms, are, telling, a, story, about, the, event, thus, they, can, for, example, be, ordered, chronologically, pictograms, were, used, by, various, ancient, cultures, all, over, the, world, since, around, 9000, bce, when, tokens, marked, with, simple, pictures, began, to, be, used, to, label, basic, farm, produce, and, become, increasingly, popular, around, 6000, 5000, bce, another, example, of, this, is, how, the, people, of, the, netherlands, used, pictograms, to, portray, what, was, going, on, at, the, time, they, were, the, basis, of, cuneiform, and, hieroglyphs, and, began, to, develop, into, logographic, writing, systems, around, 5000, bce, pictograms, in, turn, evolved, into, ideograms, graphical, symbols, that, represent, an, idea, their, ancestors, the, pictograms, could, represent, only, something, resembling, their, form, therefore, a, pictogram, of, a, circle, could, represent, a, sun, but, not, concepts, like, heat, light, day, or, great, god, of, the, sun, ideograms, on, the, other, hand, could, convey, more, abstract, concepts, because, some, ideas, are, universal, many, different, cultures, developed, similar, ideograms, for, example, an, eye, with, a, tear, means, sadness, in, native, american, ideograms, in, california, as, it, does, for, the, aztecs, the, early, chinese, and, the, egyptians, ideograms, were, precursors, of, logographic, writing, systems, the, oldest, known, forms, of, writing, were, primarily, logographic, in, nature, based, on, pictographic, and, ideographic, elements, most, writing, systems, can, be, broadly, divided, into, three, categories, logographic, syllabic, and, alphabetic, or, segmental, however, all, three, may, be, found, in, any, given, writing, system, in, varying, proportions, often, making, it, difficult, to, categorize, a, system, uniquely, the, invention, of, the, first, writing, systems, is, roughly, contemporary, with, the, beginning, of, the, bronze, age, in, the, late, neolithic, of, the, late, 5th, millennium, bce, the, first, writing, system, is, generally, believed, to, have, been, invented, in, prehistoric, sumer, and, developed, by, the, late, 4th, millennium, bce, into, cuneiform, egyptian, hieroglyphs, and, the, undeciphered, proto, elamite, writing, system, and, indus, valley, script, also, date, to, this, era, though, a, few, scholars, have, questioned, the, indus, valley, script, s, status, as, a, writing, system, the, original, sumerian, writing, system, was, derived, from, a, system, of, clay, tokens, used, to, represent, commodities, by, the, end, of, the, 4th, millennium, bce, this, had, evolved, into, a, method, of, keeping, accounts, using, a, round, shaped, stylus, impressed, into, soft, clay, at, different, angles, for, recording, numbers, this, was, gradually, augmented, with, pictographic, writing, using, a, sharp, stylus, to, indicate, what, was, being, counted, round, stylus, and, sharp, stylus, writing, was, gradually, replaced, about, 2700, 2000, bc, by, writing, using, a, wedge, shaped, stylus, hence, the, term, cuneiform, at, first, only, for, logograms, but, developed, to, include, phonetic, elements, by, 2800, bce, about, 2600, bce, cuneiform, began, to, represent, syllables, of, spoken, sumerian, language, finally, cuneiform, writing, became, general, purpose, writing, system, for, logograms, syllables, and, numbers, by, the, 26th, century, bce, this, script, had, been, adapted, to, another, mesopotamian, language, akkadian, and, from, that, to, others, such, as, hurrian, and, hittite, scripts, similar, in, appearance, to, this, writing, system, include, those, for, ugaritic, and, old, persian, the, chinese, script, may, have, originated, independently, of, the, middle, eastern, scripts, around, the, 16th, century, bce, early, shang, dynasty, out, of, a, late, neolithic, chinese, system, of, proto, writing, dating, back, to, c, 6000, bce, the, inspiration, of, chinese, script, originally, came, from, bird, and, animal, tracks, and, how, they, could, they, are, so, distinct, the, pre, columbian, writing, systems, of, the, americas, including, olmec, and, mayan, are, also, generally, believed, to, have, had, independent, origins, the, first, pure, alphabets, properly, abjads, mapping, single, symbols, to, single, phonemes, but, not, necessarily, each, phoneme, to, a, symbol, emerged, around, 2000, bce, in, ancient, egypt, but, by, then, alphabetic, principles, had, already, been, incorporated, into, egyptian, hieroglyphs, for, a, millennium, see, middle, bronze, age, alphabets, for, example, the, letter, f, is, a, phonetic, variant, of, the, first, letter, of, the, hebrew, word, vav, meaning, nail, by, 2700, bce, egyptian, writing, had, a, set, of, some, 22, hieroglyphs, to, represent, syllables, that, begin, with, a, single, consonant, of, their, language, plus, a, vowel, or, no, vowel, to, be, supplied, by, the, native, speaker, these, glyphs, were, used, as, pronunciation, guides, for, logograms, to, write, grammatical, inflections, and, later, to, transcribe, loan, words, and, foreign, names, however, although, seemingly, alphabetic, in, nature, the, original, egyptian, uniliterals, were, not, a, system, and, were, never, used, by, themselves, to, encode, egyptian, speech, in, the, middle, bronze, age, an, apparently, alphabetic, system, is, thought, by, some, to, have, been, developed, in, central, egypt, around, 1700, bce, for, or, by, semitic, workers, but, we, cannot, read, these, early, writings, and, their, exact, nature, remains, open, to, interpretation, over, the, next, five, centuries, this, semitic, alphabet, really, a, syllabary, like, phoenician, writing, seems, to, have, spread, north, all, subsequent, alphabets, around, the, world, with, the, sole, exception, of, korean, hangul, have, either, descended, from, it, or, been, inspired, by, one, of, its, descendants, scholars, agree, that, there, is, a, relationship, between, the, west, semitic, alphabet, and, the, creation, of, the, greek, alphabet, there, is, debate, between, scholars, regarding, the, earliest, uses, of, the, greek, alphabet, because, of, the, changes, that, were, made, to, create, the, greek, alphabet, the, greek, alphabet, had, the, following, characteristics, scholars, believe, that, at, one, point, in, time, early, greek, scripts, were, very, close, to, the, west, semitic, alphabet, over, time, the, changes, that, were, made, to, the, greek, alphabet, were, introduced, as, a, result, of, the, need, for, the, greeks, to, find, a, better, way, to, express, their, spoken, language, in, a, more, accurate, way, verbal, communication, is, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, human, communication, the, oral, tradition, of, storytelling, has, dated, back, to, various, times, in, history, the, development, of, communication, in, its, oral, form, can, be, based, on, certain, historical, periods, the, complexity, of, oral, communication, has, always, been, reflective, based, on, the, circumstance, of, the, time, period, verbal, communication, was, never, bound, to, one, specific, area, instead, it, had, and, continues, to, be, a, globally, shared, tradition, of, communication, people, communicated, through, song, poems, and, chants, as, some, examples, people, would, gather, in, groups, and, pass, down, stories, myths, and, history, oral, poets, from, indo, european, regions, were, known, as, weavers, of, words, for, their, mastery, over, the, spoken, word, and, ability, to, tell, stories, nomadic, people, also, had, oral, traditions, that, they, used, to, tell, stories, of, the, history, of, their, people, to, pass, them, on, to, the, next, generation, nomadic, tribes, have, been, the, torch, bearers, of, oral, storytelling, nomads, of, arabia, are, one, example, of, the, many, nomadic, tribes, that, have, continued, through, history, to, use, oral, storytelling, as, a, tool, to, tell, their, histories, and, the, story, of, their, people, due, to, the, nature, of, nomadic, life, these, individuals, were, often, left, without, architecture, and, possessions, to, call, their, own, and, often, left, little, to, no, traces, of, themselves, the, richness, of, the, nomadic, life, and, culture, is, preserved, by, early, muslim, scholars, who, collect, the, poems, and, stories, that, are, handed, down, from, generation, to, generation, poems, created, by, these, arabic, nomads, are, passed, down, by, specialists, known, as, sha, ir, these, individuals, spread, the, stories, and, histories, of, these, nomadic, tribes, and, often, in, times, of, war, would, strengthen, morale, within, members, of, given, tribes, through, these, stories, another, example, of, this, nomadic, lifestyle, where, the, people, had, no, possessions, but, only, passed, on, stories, were, the, waldensians, who, passed, along, the, word, of, god, to, anyone, who, would, listen, in, its, natural, form, oral, communication, was, and, has, continued, to, be, one, of, the, best, ways, for, humans, to, spread, their, message, history, and, traditions, to, the, world, the, history, of, telecommunication, the, transmission, of, signals, over, a, distance, for, communication, began, thousands, of, years, ago, with, the, use, of, smoke, signals, and, drums, in, africa, america, and, parts, of, asia, in, the, 1790s, the, first, fixed, semaphore, systems, emerged, in, europe, however, it, was, not, until, the, 1830s, that, electrical, telecommunication, systems, started, to, appear
