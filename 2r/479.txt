against, batista, escalated, the, rebel, forces, transformed, from, crude, guerrilla, fighters, into, a, cohesive, fighting, force, that, could, confront, batista, s, army, in, military, engagements, by, the, time, the, rebels, were, able, to, oust, batista, the, revolution, was, being, driven, by, a, coalition, between, the, popular, socialist, party, the, 26th, of, july, movement, and, the, revolutionary, directorate, of, 13, march, the, rebels, led, by, the, 26th, of, july, movement, finally, toppled, batista, on, 31, december, 1958, after, which, he, fled, the, country, batista, s, government, was, dismantled, as, castro, became, the, most, prominent, leader, of, the, revolutionary, forces, soon, thereafter, the, 26th, of, july, movement, established, itself, as, the, de, facto, government, although, castro, was, immensely, popular, in, the, period, immediately, following, batista, s, ouster, he, quickly, consolidated, power, leading, to, domestic, and, international, tensions, 26, july, 1953, is, celebrated, in, cuba, as, d, a, de, la, revoluci, n, from, spanish, day, of, the, revolution, the, 26th, of, july, movement, later, reformed, along, marxist, leninist, lines, becoming, the, communist, party, of, cuba, in, october, 1965, the, cuban, revolution, had, powerful, and, profound, domestic, and, international, repercussions, in, particular, it, shipwrecked, cuba, united, states, relations, although, efforts, to, improve, them, such, as, the, cuban, thaw, gained, momentum, during, the, 2010s, and, have, continued, through, the, 2020s, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, revolution, castro, s, government, began, a, program, of, nationalization, centralization, of, the, press, and, political, consolidation, that, transformed, cuba, s, economy, and, civil, society, angering, sectors, of, the, cuban, population, and, the, american, government, in, the, aftermath, of, the, revolution, castro, s, authoritarianism, in, conjunction, with, the, struggling, economy, lead, to, the, cuban, exodus, as, citizens, fled, the, island, with, the, majority, arriving, in, the, united, states, the, revolution, also, heralded, an, era, of, cuban, intervention, in, foreign, conflicts, in, africa, latin, america, southeast, asia, and, the, middle, east, several, rebellions, occurred, between, 1959, and, 1965, mainly, in, the, escambray, mountains, which, were, suppressed, by, the, revolutionary, government, the, republic, of, cuba, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, was, largely, characterized, by, a, deeply, ingrained, tradition, of, corruption, where, political, participation, resulted, in, opportunities, for, elites, to, engage, in, wealth, accumulation, cuba, s, first, presidential, period, under, don, tom, s, estrada, palma, from, 1902, to, 1906, was, considered, to, uphold, the, best, standards, of, administrative, integrity, in, the, history, of, the, republic, of, cuba, however, a, united, states, intervention, in, 1906, resulted, in, charles, edward, magoon, an, american, diplomat, taking, over, the, government, until, 1909, although, magoon, s, government, did, not, condone, corrupt, practices, there, is, debate, as, to, how, much, was, done, to, stop, what, was, widespread, especially, with, the, surge, of, american, money, coming, into, the, small, country, hugh, thomas, suggests, that, while, magoon, disapproved, of, corrupt, practices, corruption, still, persisted, under, his, administration, and, he, undermined, the, autonomy, of, the, judiciary, and, their, court, decisions, on, 29, january, 1909, the, sovereign, government, of, cuba, was, restored, and, jos, miguel, g, mez, became, president, no, explicit, evidence, of, magoon, s, corruption, ever, surfaced, but, his, parting, gesture, of, issuing, lucrative, cuban, contracts, to, u, s, firms, was, a, continued, point, of, contention, cuba, s, subsequent, president, jos, miguel, g, mez, was, the, first, to, become, involved, in, pervasive, corruption, and, government, corruption, scandals, these, scandals, involved, bribes, that, were, allegedly, paid, to, cuban, officials, and, legislators, under, a, contract, to, search, the, havana, harbour, as, well, as, the, payment, of, fees, to, government, associates, and, high, level, officials, g, mez, s, successor, mario, garc, a, menocal, wanted, to, put, an, end, to, the, corruption, scandals, and, claimed, to, be, committed, to, administrative, integrity, as, he, ran, on, a, slogan, of, honesty, peace, and, work, despite, his, intentions, corruption, actually, intensified, under, his, government, from, 1913, to, 1921, instances, of, fraud, became, more, common, while, private, actors, and, contractors, frequently, colluded, with, public, officials, and, legislators, charles, edward, chapman, attributes, the, increase, of, corruption, to, the, sugar, boom, that, occurred, in, cuba, under, the, menocal, administration, furthermore, the, advent, of, world, war, one, enabled, the, cuban, government, to, manipulate, sugar, prices, the, sales, of, exports, and, import, permits, while, in, office, garc, a, menocal, hosted, his, college, fraternity, in, the, 1920, delta, kappa, epsilon, national, convention, the, first, international, fraternity, conference, outside, the, us, which, took, place, in, cuba, he, was, responsible, for, creating, the, cuban, peso, until, his, presidency, cuba, used, both, the, spanish, real, and, us, dollar, president, menocal, left, the, cuban, national, treasury, in, overdraft, and, therefore, in, precarious, financial, situation, menocal, supposedly, spent, 800, million, during, his, 8, years, in, office, and, left, a, floating, debt, of, 40, million, alfredo, zayas, succeeded, menocal, from, 1921, to, 1925, and, engaged, in, what, calixto, mas, refers, to, as, the, maximum, expression, of, administrative, corruption, both, petty, and, grand, corruption, spread, to, nearly, all, aspects, of, public, life, and, the, cuban, administration, became, largely, characterized, by, nepotism, as, zayas, relied, on, friends, and, relatives, to, illegally, gain, greater, access, to, wealth, gerardo, machado, succeeded, zayas, from, 1925, to, 1933, and, entered, the, presidency, with, widespread, popularity, and, support, from, the, major, political, parties, however, his, support, declined, over, time, due, to, zayas, previous, policies, gerardo, machado, aimed, to, diminish, corruption, and, improve, the, public, sector, s, performance, under, his, successive, administration, from, 1925, to, 1933, while, he, was, successfully, able, to, reduce, the, amounts, of, low, level, and, petty, corruption, grand, corruption, still, largely, persisted, machado, embarked, on, development, projects, that, enabled, the, persistence, of, grand, corruption, through, inflated, costs, and, the, creation, of, large, margins, that, enabled, public, officials, to, appropriate, money, illegally, under, his, government, opportunities, for, corruption, became, concentrated, into, fewer, hands, with, centralized, government, purchasing, procedures, and, the, collection, of, bribes, among, a, smaller, number, of, bureaucrats, and, administrators, through, the, development, of, real, estate, infrastructures, and, the, growth, of, cuba, s, tourism, industry, machado, s, administration, was, able, to, use, insider, information, to, profit, from, private, sector, business, deals, many, people, objected, to, his, running, again, for, re, election, in, 1928, as, his, victory, violated, his, promise, to, serve, for, only, one, term, as, protests, and, rebellions, became, more, strident, his, administration, curtailed, free, speech, and, used, repressive, police, tactics, against, opponents, machado, unleashed, a, wave, of, violence, against, his, critics, and, there, were, numerous, murders, and, assassinations, committed, by, the, police, and, army, under, machado, s, administration, the, extent, of, his, involvement, in, these, is, disputed, but, in, the, end, machado, is, described, as, a, dictator, in, may, 1933, machado, was, forced, out, as, newly, appointed, us, ambassador, sumner, welles, arrived, in, cuba, and, initiated, negotiation, with, the, opposition, groups, for, a, government, to, succeed, machado, s, a, provisional, government, headed, by, carlos, manuel, de, c, spedes, y, quesada, son, of, cuban, independence, hero, carlos, manuel, de, c, spedes, and, including, members, of, the, abc, was, brokered, it, took, power, in, august, 1933, amidst, a, general, strike, in, havana, carlos, manuel, de, c, spedes, y, quesada, subsequently, was, offered, the, position, of, president, by, ambassador, sumner, welles, he, took, office, on, 13, august, 1933, and, welles, proposed, that, general, elections, may, be, held, approximately, 3, months, from, now, so, that, cuba, may, once, more, have, a, constitutional, government, in, the, real, sense, of, the, word, c, spedes, agreed, and, declared, that, a, general, election, would, be, held, on, 24, february, 1934, for, a, new, presidential, term, to, begin, on, 20, may, 1934, however, on, 4, 5, september, 1933, the, sergeants, revolt, took, place, while, c, spedes, was, in, matanzas, and, santa, clara, after, a, hurricane, had, ravaged, those, regions, the, junta, of, officers, led, by, sergeant, fulgencio, batista, and, students, proclaimed, that, it, had, taken, power, in, order, to, fulfill, the, aims, of, the, revolution, it, briefly, described, a, program, which, included, economic, restructuring, punishment, of, wrongdoers, recognition, of, public, debts, creation, of, courts, political, reorganization, and, any, other, actions, necessary, to, construct, a, new, cuba, based, on, justice, and, democracy, only, five, days, after, the, coup, batista, and, the, student, directory, promoted, ram, n, grau, to, the, role, of, president, the, ensuing, one, hundred, days, government, issued, a, number, of, reformist, declarations, but, never, gained, diplomatic, recognition, from, the, us, it, was, overthrown, in, january, 1934, under, pressure, from, batista, and, the, us, ambassador, grau, was, replaced, by, carlos, mendieta, and, within, five, days, the, u, s, recognized, cuba, s, new, government, the, corruption, was, not, curtailed, under, mendieta, and, he, resigned, in, 1935, after, unrest, continued, and, their, followed, a, number, of, interim, and, weak, presidents, under, the, guidance, of, batista, and, the, us, batista, supported, by, the, democratic, socialist, coalition, which, included, julio, antonio, mella, s, communist, party, defeated, grau, in, the, first, presidential, election, under, the, new, cuban, constitution, in, the, 1940, election, and, served, a, four, year, term, as, president, of, cuba, batista, was, endorsed, by, the, original, communist, party, of, cuba, later, known, as, the, popular, socialist, party, which, at, the, time, had, little, significance, and, no, probability, of, an, electoral, victory, this, support, was, primarily, due, to, batista, s, labor, laws, and, his, support, for, labor, unions, with, which, the, communists, had, close, ties, in, fact, communists, attacked, the, anti, batista, opposition, saying, grau, and, others, were, fascists, and, reactionaries, senator, eduardo, chib, s, dedicated, himself, to, exposing, corruption, in, the, cuban, government, and, formed, the, partido, ortodoxo, in, 1947, to, further, this, aim, argote, freyre, points, out, that, cuba, s, population, under, the, republic, had, a, high, tolerance, for, corruption, furthermore, cubans, knew, and, criticized, who, was, corrupt, but, admired, them, for, their, ability, to, act, as, criminals, with, impunity, corrupt, officials, went, beyond, members, of, congress, to, also, include, military, officials, who, granted, favours, to, residents, and, accepted, bribes, the, establishment, of, an, illegal, gambling, network, within, the, military, enabled, army, personnel, such, as, lieutenant, colonel, pedraza, and, major, marin, to, engage, in, extensive, illegal, gambling, activities, mauricio, augusto, font, and, alfonso, quiroz, authors, of, the, cuban, republic, and, jos, mart, say, that, corruption, pervaded, in, public, life, under, the, administrations, of, presidents, ram, n, grau, and, carlos, pr, o, socarr, s, pr, o, was, reported, to, have, stolen, over, 90, million, in, public, funds, which, was, equivalent, to, one, fourth, of, the, annual, national, budget, prior, to, the, communist, revolution, cuba, was, ruled, under, the, elected, government, of, fulgencio, batista, from, 1940, to, 1944, throughout, this, time, period, batista, s, support, base, consisted, mainly, of, corrupt, politicians, and, military, officials, batista, himself, was, able, to, heavily, profit, from, the, regime, before, coming, into, power, through, inflated, government, contracts, and, gambling, proceeds, in, 1942, the, british, foreign, office, reported, that, the, u, s, state, department, was, very, worried, about, corruption, under, president, fulgencio, batista, describing, the, problem, as, endemic, and, exceeding, anything, which, had, gone, on, previously, british, diplomats, believed, that, corruption, was, rooted, within, cuba, s, most, powerful, institutions, with, the, highest, individuals, in, government, and, military, being, heavily, involved, in, gambling, and, the, drug, trade, in, terms, of, civil, society, eduardo, saenz, rovner, writes, that, corruption, within, the, police, and, government, enabled, the, expansion, of, criminal, organizations, in, cuba, batista, refused, u, s, president, franklin, roosevelt, s, offer, to, send, experts, to, help, reform, the, cuban, civil, service, batista, didn, t, run, in, the, 1944, election, and, partido, aut, ntico, party, member, ram, n, grau, was, elected, president, and, oversaw, extensive, corruption, during, his, administration, he, had, carlos, pr, o, socarr, s, serve, turns, as, minister, of, public, works, minister, of, labor, and, prime, minister, on, the, next, election, 1, july, 1948, prio, was, elected, president, of, cuba, as, a, member, of, the, partido, aut, ntico, which, presided, over, corruption, and, irresponsible, government, of, this, period, pr, o, was, assisted, by, chief, of, the, armed, forces, general, genobebo, p, rez, d, mera, and, colonel, jos, luis, chinea, cardenas, who, had, previously, been, in, charge, of, the, province, of, santa, clara, the, eight, years, under, grau, and, pr, o, were, marked, by, violence, among, political, factions, and, reports, of, theft, and, self, enrichment, in, the, government, ranks, the, pr, o, administration, increasingly, came, to, be, perceived, by, the, public, as, ineffectual, in, the, face, of, violence, and, corruption, much, as, the, grau, administration, before, it, with, elections, scheduled, for, the, middle, of, 1952, rumors, surfaced, of, a, planned, military, coup, by, long, shot, presidential, contender, fulgencio, batista, pr, o, seeing, no, constitutional, basis, to, act, did, not, do, so, the, rumors, proved, to, be, true, on, 10, march, 1952, batista, and, his, collaborators, seized, military, and, police, commands, throughout, the, country, and, occupied, major, radio, and, tv, stations, batista, assumed, power, when, pr, o, failing, to, mount, a, resistance, boarded, a, plane, and, went, into, exile, batista, after, his, military, coup, against, pr, o, socarras, again, took, power, and, ruled, until, 1959, under, his, rule, batista, led, a, corrupt, dictatorship, that, involved, close, links, with, organized, crime, organizations, and, the, reduction, of, civil, freedoms, of, cubans, this, period, resulted, in, batista, engaging, in, more, sophisticated, practices, of, corruption, at, both, the, administrative, and, civil, society, levels, batista, and, his, administration, engaged, in, profiteering, from, the, lottery, as, well, as, illegal, gambling, corruption, further, flourished, in, civil, society, through, increasing, amounts, of, police, corruption, censorship, of, the, press, as, well, as, media, and, creating, anti, communist, campaigns, that, suppressed, opposition, with, violence, torture, and, public, executions, the, former, culture, of, toleration, and, acceptance, towards, corruption, also, dissolved, with, the, dictatorship, of, batista, for, instance, one, citizen, wrote, that, however, corrupt, grau, and, pr, o, were, we, elected, them, and, therefore, allowed, them, to, steal, from, us, batista, robs, us, without, our, permission, corruption, under, batista, further, expanded, into, the, economic, sector, with, alliances, that, he, forged, with, foreign, investors, and, the, prevalence, of, illegal, casinos, and, criminal, organizations, in, the, country, s, capital, of, havana, in, the, decades, following, the, united, states, invasion, of, cuba, in, 1898, and, formal, independence, from, the, u, s, on, 20, may, 1902, cuba, experienced, a, period, of, significant, instability, enduring, a, number, of, revolts, coups, and, a, period, of, u, s, military, occupation, fulgencio, batista, a, former, soldier, who, had, served, as, the, elected, president, of, cuba, from, 1940, to, 1944, became, president, for, the, second, time, in, 1952, after, seizing, power, in, a, military, coup, and, canceling, the, 1952, elections, although, batista, had, been, relatively, progressive, during, his, first, term, in, the, 1950s, he, proved, far, more, dictatorial, and, indifferent, to, popular, concerns, while, cuba, remained, plagued, by, high, unemployment, and, limited, water, infrastructure, batista, antagonized, the, population, by, forming, lucrative, links, to, organized, crime, and, allowing, american, companies, to, dominate, the, cuban, economy, especially, sugar, cane, plantations, and, other, local, resources, although, the, us, armed, and, politically, supported, the, batista, dictatorship, later, us, president, john, f, kennedy, recognized, its, corruption, and, the, justifiability, of, removing, it, during, his, first, term, as, president, batista, was, supported, by, the, original, communist, party, of, cuba, later, known, as, the, popular, socialist, party, but, during, his, second, term, he, became, strongly, anti, communist, in, the, months, following, the, march, 1952, coup, fidel, castro, then, a, young, lawyer, and, activist, petitioned, for, the, overthrow, of, batista, whom, he, accused, of, corruption, and, tyranny, however, castro, s, constitutional, arguments, were, rejected, by, the, cuban, courts, after, deciding, that, the, cuban, regime, could, not, be, replaced, through, legal, means, castro, resolved, to, launch, an, armed, revolution, to, this, end, he, and, his, brother, ra, l, founded, a, paramilitary, organization, known, as, the, movement, stockpiling, weapons, and, recruiting, around, 1, 200, followers, from, havana, s, disgruntled, working, class, by, the, end, of, 1952, striking, their, first, blow, against, the, batista, government, fidel, and, ra, l, castro, gathered, 70, fighters, and, planned, a, multi, pronged, attack, on, several, military, installations, on, 26, july, 1953, the, rebels, attacked, the, moncada, barracks, in, santiago, and, the, barracks, in, bayamo, only, to, be, decisively, defeated, by, the, far, more, numerous, government, soldiers, it, was, hoped, that, the, staged, attack, would, spark, a, nationwide, revolt, against, batista, s, government, after, an, hour, of, fighting, most, of, the, rebels, and, their, leader, fled, to, the, mountains, the, exact, number, of, rebels, killed, in, the, battle, is, debatable, however, in, his, autobiography, fidel, castro, claimed, that, nine, were, killed, in, the, fighting, and, an, additional, 56, were, executed, after, being, captured, by, the, batista, government, due, to, the, government, s, large, number, of, men, hunt, revised, the, number, to, be, around, 60, members, taking, the, opportunity, to, flee, to, the, mountains, along, with, castro, among, the, dead, was, abel, santamar, a, castro, s, second, in, command, who, was, imprisoned, tortured, and, executed, on, the, same, day, as, the, attack, numerous, key, movement, revolutionaries, including, the, castro, brothers, were, captured, shortly, afterwards, in, a, highly, political, trial, fidel, spoke, for, nearly, four, hours, in, his, defense, ending, with, the, words, condemn, me, it, does, not, matter, history, will, absolve, me, castro, s, defense, was, based, on, nationalism, the, representation, and, beneficial, programs, for, the, non, elite, cubans, and, his, patriotism, and, justice, for, the, cuban, community, fidel, was, sentenced, to, 15, years, in, the, presidio, modelo, prison, located, on, isla, de, pinos, while, ra, l, was, sentenced, to, 13, years, however, in, 1955, under, broad, political, pressure, the, batista, government, freed, all, political, prisoners, in, cuba, including, the, moncada, attackers, fidel, s, jesuit, childhood, teachers, succeeded, in, persuading, batista, to, include, fidel, and, ra, l, in, the, release, soon, the, castro, brothers, joined, with, other, exiles, in, mexico, to, prepare, for, the, overthrow, of, batista, receiving, training, from, alberto, bayo, a, leader, of, republican, forces, in, the, spanish, civil, war, in, june, 1955, fidel, met, the, argentine, revolutionary, ernesto, che, guevara, who, joined, his, cause, ra, l, and, fidel, s, chief, advisor, ernesto, aided, the, initiation, of, batista, s, amnesty, the, revolutionaries, named, themselves, the, 26th, of, july, movement, in, reference, to, the, date, of, their, attack, on, the, moncada, barracks, in, 1953, by, late, 1955, student, riots, and, demonstrations, became, more, common, and, unemployment, became, problematic, as, new, graduates, could, not, find, jobs, these, protests, were, dealt, with, increasing, repression, all, young, people, were, seen, as, possible, revolutionaries, due, to, its, continued, opposition, to, the, cuban, government, and, much, protest, activity, taking, place, on, its, campus, the, university, of, havana, was, temporarily, closed, on, 30, november, 1956, it, did, not, reopen, until, 1959, under, the, first, revolutionary, government, while, the, castro, brothers, and, the, other, 26, july, movement, guerrillas, were, training, in, mexico, and, preparing, for, their, amphibious, deployment, to, cuba, another, revolutionary, group, followed, the, example, of, the, moncada, barracks, assault, on, 29, april, 1956, at, 12, 50, pm, during, sunday, mass, an, independent, guerrilla, group, of, around, 100, rebels, led, by, reynol, garc, a, attacked, the, domingo, goicuria, army, barracks, in, matanzas, province, the, attack, was, repelled, with, ten, rebels, and, three, soldiers, killed, in, the, fighting, and, one, rebel, summarily, executed, by, the, garrison, commander, pilar, garc, a, florida, international, university, historian, miguel, a, bretos, was, in, the, nearby, cathedral, when, the, firefight, began, he, writes, that, day, the,

ernesto, che, guevara, and, camilo, cienfuegos, even, though, the, yacht, was, only, designed, to, accommodate, 12, people, with, a, maximum, of, 25, on, 2, december, it, landed, in, playa, las, coloradas, in, the, municipality, of, niquero, arriving, two, days, later, than, planned, because, the, boat, was, heavily, loaded, unlike, during, the, practice, sailing, runs, this, dashed, any, hopes, for, a, coordinated, attack, with, the, llano, wing, of, the, movement, after, arriving, and, exiting, the, ship, the, band, of, rebels, began, to, make, their, way, into, the, sierra, maestra,

cia, connected, frank, sturgis, who, offered, to, train, castro, s, troops, in, guerrilla, warfare, castro, accepted, the, offer, but, he, also, had, an, immediate, need, for, guns, and, ammunition, so, sturgis, became, a, gunrunner, sturgis, purchased, boatloads, of, weapons, and, ammunition, from, cia, weapons, expert, samuel, cummings, international, armament, corporation, in, alexandria,

to, castro, s, main, forces, by, protecting, supply, lines, and, by, sharing, intelligence, ultimately, the, mountains, came, under, castro, s, control, in, addition, to, armed, resistance, the, rebels, sought, to, use, propaganda, to, their, advantage, a, pirate, radio, station, called, radio, rebelde, rebel, radio, was, set, up, in, february, 1958, allowing, castro, and, his, forces, to, broadcast, their, message, nationwide, within, enemy, territory, castro, s, affiliation, with, the, new, york, times, journalist, herbert, matthews, created, a, front, page, worthy, report, on, anti, communist, propaganda, the, radio, broadcasts, were, made, possible, by, carlos, franqui, a, previous, acquaintance, of, castro, who, subsequently, became, a, cuban, exile, in, puerto, rico, during, this, time, castro, s, forces, remained, quite, small, in, numbers, sometimes, fewer, than, 200, men, while, the, cuban, military, and, police, force, had, a, manpower, of, around, 37, 000, even, so, nearly, every, time, the, cuban, military, fought, against, the, revolutionaries, the, army, was, forced, to, retreat, an, arms, embargo, imposed, on, the, cuban, government, by, the, united, states, on, 14, march, 1958, contributed, significantly, to, the, weakness, of, batista, s, forces, the, cuban, air, force, rapidly, deteriorated, it, could, not, repair, its, airplanes, without, importing, parts, from, the, united, states, batista, finally, responded, to, castro, s, efforts, with, an, attack, on, the, mountains, called, operation, verano, summer, known, to, the, rebels, as, la, ofensiva, the, army, sent, some, 12, 000, soldiers, half, of, them, untrained, recruits, into, the, mountains, in, a, series, of, small, skirmishes, castro, s, determined, guerrillas, defeated, the, cuban, army, in, the, battle, of, la, plata, which, lasted, from, 11, to, 21, july, 1958, castro, s, forces, defeated, a, 500, man, battalion, capturing, 240, men, while, losing, just, three, of, their, own, however, the, tide, nearly, turned, on, 29, july, 1958, when, batista, s, troops, almost, destroyed, castro, s, small, army, of, some, 300, men, at, the, battle, of, las, mercedes, with, his, forces, pinned, down, by, superior, numbers, castro, asked, for, and, received, a, temporary, cease, fire, on, 1, august, over, the, next, seven, days, while, fruitless, negotiations, took, place, castro, s, forces, gradually, escaped, from, the, trap, by, 8, august, castro, s, entire, army, had, escaped, back, into, the, mountains, and, operation, verano, had, effectively, ended, in, failure, for, the, batista, government, the, battle, of, las, mercedes, 29, july, 8, august, 1958, was, the, last, battle, of, operation, verano, the, battle, was, a, trap, designed, by, cuban, general, eulogio, cantillo, to, lure, fidel, castro, s, guerrillas, into, a, place, where, they, could, be, surrounded, and, destroyed, the, battle, ended, with, a, cease, fire, which, castro, proposed, and, which, cantillo, accepted, during, the, cease, fire, castro, s, forces, escaped, back, into, the, mountains, the, battle, though, technically, a, victory, for, the, cuban, army, left, the, army, dispirited, and, demoralized, castro, viewed, the, result, as, a, victory, and, soon, launched, his, own, offensive, battalion, 17, began, its, pull, back, on, 29, july, 1958, castro, sent, a, column, of, men, under, ren, ramos, latour, to, ambush, the, retreating, soldiers, they, attacked, the, advance, guard, and, killed, some, 30, soldiers, but, then, came, under, attack, from, previously, undetected, cuban, forces, latour, called, for, help, and, castro, came, to, the, battle, scene, with, his, own, column, of, men, castro, s, column, also, came, under, fire, from, another, group, of, cuban, soldiers, that, had, secretly, advanced, up, the, road, from, the, estrada, palma, sugar, mill, as, the, battle, heated, up, general, cantillo, called, up, more, forces, from, nearby, towns, and, some, 1, 500, troops, started, heading, towards, the, fighting, however, this, force, was, halted, by, a, column, under, che, guevara, s, command, while, some, critics, accuse, che, for, not, coming, to, the, aid, of, latour, major, bockman, argues, that, che, s, move, here, was, the, correct, thing, to, do, indeed, he, called, che, s, tactical, appreciation, of, the, battle, brilliant, by, the, end, of, july, castro, s, troops, were, fully, engaged, and, in, danger, of, being, wiped, out, by, the, vastly, superior, numbers, of, the, cuban, army, he, had, lost, 70, men, including, ren, latour, and, both, he, and, the, remains, of, latour, s, column, were, surrounded, the, next, day, castro, requested, a, cease, fire, with, general, cantillo, even, offering, to, negotiate, an, end, to, the, war, this, offer, was, accepted, by, general, cantillo, for, reasons, that, remain, unclear, batista, sent, a, personal, representative, to, negotiate, with, castro, on, 2, august, the, negotiations, yielded, no, result, but, during, the, next, six, nights, castro, s, troops, managed, to, slip, away, unnoticed, on, 8, august, when, the, cuban, army, resumed, its, attack, they, found, no, one, to, fight, castro, s, remaining, forces, had, escaped, back, into, the, mountains, and, operation, verano, had, effectively, ended, in, failure, for, the, batista, government, in, december, 1958, fidel, castro, ordered, his, revolutionary, army, to, go, on, the, offensive, against, batista, s, army, while, castro, led, one, force, against, guisa, mas, and, other, towns, another, major, offensive, was, directed, at, the, capture, of, the, city, of, santa, clara, the, capital, of, what, was, then, las, villas, province, three, columns, were, sent, against, santa, clara, under, the, command, of, che, guevara, jaime, vega, and, camilo, cienfuegos, vega, s, column, was, caught, in, an, ambush, and, completely, destroyed, guevara, s, column, took, up, positions, around, santa, clara, near, fomento, cienfuegos, s, column, directly, attacked, a, local, army, garrison, at, yaguajay, initially, numbering, just, 60, men, out, of, castro, s, hardened, core, of, 230, cienfuegos, s, group, had, gained, many, recruits, as, it, crossed, the, countryside, towards, santa, clara, eventually, reaching, an, estimated, strength, of, 450, to, 500, fighters, the, garrison, consisted, of, some, 250, men, under, the, command, of, a, cuban, captain, of, chinese, ancestry, alfredo, abon, lee, the, attack, seems, to, have, started, around, 19, december, convinced, that, reinforcements, would, be, sent, from, santa, clara, lee, put, up, a, determined, defense, of, his, post, the, guerrillas, repeatedly, attempted, to, overpower, lee, and, his, men, but, failed, each, time, by, 26, december, camilo, cienfuegos, had, become, quite, frustrated, it, seemed, that, lee, could, not, be, overpowered, nor, could, he, be, convinced, to, surrender, in, desperation, cienfuegos, tried, using, a, homemade, tank, against, lee, s, position, the, tank, was, actually, a, large, tractor, encased, in, iron, plates, with, attached, makeshift, flamethrowers, on, top, it, too, proved, unsuccessful, finally, on, 30, december, lee, ran, out, of, ammunition, and, was, forced, to, surrender, his, force, to, the, guerrillas, the, surrender, of, the, garrison, was, a, major, blow, to, the, defenders, of, the, provincial, capital, of, santa, clara, the, next, day, the, combined, forces, of, cienfuegos, guevara, and, local, revolutionaries,

president, as, urrutia, s, participation, in, the, legislative, process, declined, other, unresolved, disputes, between, the, two, leaders, continued, to, fester, his, belief, in, the, restoration, of, elections, was, rejected, by, castro, who, felt, that, they, would, usher, in, a, return, to, the, old, discredited, system, of, corrupt, parties, and, fraudulent, balloting, that, had, marked, the, batista, era, urrutia, was, then, accused, by, the, avance, newspaper, of, buying, a, luxury, villa, which, was, portrayed, as, a, frivolous, betrayal, of, the, revolution, and, led, to, an, outcry, from, the, general, public, he, denied, the, allegation, issuing, a, writ, against, the, newspaper, in, response, the, story, further, increased, tensions, between, the, various, factions, in, the, government, though, urrutia, asserted, publicly, that, he, had, absolutely, no, disagreements, with, fidel, castro, urrutia, attempted, to, distance, the, cuban, government, including, castro, from, the, growing, influence, of, the, communists, within, the, administration, making, a, series, of, critical, public, comments, against, the, latter, group, whilst, castro, had, not, openly, declared, any, affiliation, with, the, cuban, communists, urrutia, had, been, a, declared, anti, communist, since, they, had, refused, to, support, the, insurrection, against, batista, stating, in, an, interview, if, the, cuban, people, had, heeded, those, words, we, would, still, have, batista, with, us, and, all, those, other, war, criminals, who, are, now, running, away, the, cuban, revolution, was, a, crucial, turning, point, in, u, s, cuban, relations, although, the, united, states, government, was, initially, willing, to, recognize, castro, s, new, government, it, soon, came, to, fear, that, communist, insurgencies, would, spread, through, the, nations, of, latin, america, as, they, had, in, southeast, asia, meanwhile, castro, s, government, resented, the, americans, for, providing, aid, to, batista, s, government, during, the, revolution, after, the, revolutionary, government, nationalized, all, u, s, property, in, cuba, in, august, 1960, the, american, eisenhower, administration, froze, all, cuban, assets, on, american, soil, severed, diplomatic, ties, and, tightened, its, embargo, of, cuba, the, key, west, havana, ferry, shut, down, in, 1961, the, u, s, government, launched, the, bay, of, pigs, invasion, in, which, brigade, 2506, a, cia, trained, force, of, 1, 500, soldiers, mostly, cuban, exiles, landed, on, a, mission, to, oust, castro, the, attempt, to, overthrow, castro, failed, with, the, invasion, being, repulsed, by, the, cuban, military, the, u, s, embargo, against, cuba, is, still, in, force, as, of, 2020, although, it, underwent, a, partial, loosening, during, the, obama, administration, only, to, be, strengthened, in, 2017, under, trump, the, u, s, began, efforts, to, normalize, relations, with, cuba, in, the, mid, 2010s, and, formally, reopened, its, embassy, in, havana, after, over, half, a, century, in, august, 2015, the, trump, administration, reversed, much, of, the, cuban, thaw, by, severely, restricting, travel, by, us, citizens, to, cuba, and, tightening, the, us, government, s, embargo, against, the, country, i, believe, that, there, is, no, country, in, the, world, including, the, african, regions, including, any, and, all, the, countries, under, colonial, domination, where, economic, colonization, humiliation, and, exploitation, were, worse, than, in, cuba, in, part, owing, to, my, country, s, policies, during, the, batista, regime, i, believe, that, we, created, built, and, manufactured, the, castro, movement, out, of, whole, cloth, and, without, realizing, it, i, believe, that, the, accumulation, of, these, mistakes, has, jeopardized, all, of, latin, america, the, great, aim, of, the, alliance, for, progress, is, to, reverse, this, unfortunate, policy, this, is, one, of, the, most, if, not, the, most, important, problems, in, america, foreign, policy, i, can, assure, you, that, i, have, understood, the, cubans, i, approved, the, proclamation, which, fidel, castro, made, in, the, sierra, maestra, when, he, justifiably, called, for, justice, and, especially, yearned, to, rid, cuba, of, corruption, i, will, go, even, further, to, some, extent, it, is, as, though, batista, was, the, incarnation, of, a, number, of, sins, on, the, part, of, the, united, states, now, we, shall, have, to, pay, for, those, sins, in, the, matter, of, the, batista, regime, i, am, in, agreement, with, the, first, cuban, revolutionaries, following, the, american, embargo, the, soviet, union, became, cuba, s, main, ally, the, soviet, union, did, not, initially, want, anything, to, do, with, cuba, or, latin, america, until, the, united, states, had, taken, an, interest, in, dismantling, castro, s, communist, government, at, first, many, people, in, the, soviet, union, did, not, know, anything, about, cuba, and, those, that, did, saw, castro, as, a, troublemaker, and, the, cuba, revolution, as, one, big, heresy, there, were, three, big, reasons, why, the, soviet, union, changed, their, attitudes, and, finally, took, interest, in, the, island, country, first, was, the, success, of, the, cuban, revolution, to, which, moscow, responded, with, great, interest, as, they, understood, that, if, a, communist, revolution, was, successful, for, cuba, it, could, be, successful, elsewhere, in, latin, america, so, from, then, on, the, soviets, began, looking, into, foreign, affairs, in, latin, america, second, after, learning, about, the, united, states, aggressive, plan, to, deploy, another, guatemala, scenario, in, cuba, the, soviet, opinion, quickly, changed, feet, third, soviet, leaders, saw, the, cuban, revolution, as, first, and, foremost, an, anti, north, american, revolution, which, of, course, whet, their, appetite, as, this, was, during, the, height, of, the, cold, war, and, the, soviet, us, battle, for, global, dominance, was, at, its, apex, the, soviets, attitude, of, optimism, changed, to, one, of, concern, for, the, safety, of, cuba, after, it, was, excluded, from, the, inter, american, system, at, the, conference, held, at, punta, del, este, in, january, 1962, by, the, organization, of, american, states, this, coupled, with, the, threat, of, a, united, states, invasion, of, the, island, was, really, the, turning, point, for, soviet, concern, the, idea, was, that, should, cuba, be, defeated, by, the, united, states, it, would, mean, defeat, for, the, soviet, union, and, for, marxism, leninism, if, cuba, were, to, fall, other, latin, american, countries, would, reject, us, claiming, that, for, all, our, might, the, soviet, union, had, not, been, able, to, do, anything, for, cuba, except, to, make, empty, protests, to, the, united, nations, wrote, khrushchev, the, soviet, attitude, towards, cuba, changed, to, concern, for, the, safety, of, the, island, nation, because, of, increased, us, tensions, and, threats, of, invasion, making, the, soviet, cuban, relationship, superficial, insofar, as, it, only, cared, about, denying, the, us, power, in, the, region, and, maintaining, soviet, supremacy, all, of, these, events, led, to, the, two, countries, quickly, developing, close, military, and, intelligence, ties, which, culminated, in, the, stationing, of, soviet, nuclear, weapons, in, cuba, in, 1962, an, act, which, triggered, the, cuban, missile, crisis, in, october, 1962, the, aftermath, of, the, cuban, missile, crisis, saw, international, embarrassment, for, both, the, us, and, the, soviet, union, and, many, countries, including, soviet, countries, were, quick, to, criticize, moscow, s, handling, of, the, situation, in, a, letter, that, khrushchev, writes, to, castro, in, january, of, the, following, year, 1963, after, the, end, of, conflict, he, talks, about, wanting, to, discuss, the, issues, in, the, two, countries, relations, he, writes, attacking, voices, from, other, countries, including, socialist, ones, blaming, the, ussr, of, being, opportunistic, and, self, serving, he, explained, the, decision, to, withdraw, missiles, from, cuba, stressing, the, possibility, of, advancing, communism, through, peaceful, means, khrushchev, underlined, the, importance, of, guaranteeing, against, an, american, attack, on, cuba, and, urged, havana, to, focus, on, economic, cultural, and, technological, development, to, become, a, shining, beacon, of, socialism, in, latin, america, in, closing, he, invites, fidel, castro, to, visit, moscow, and, discuss, the, preparations, for, such, a, trip, the, following, two, decades, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, were, somewhat, of, an, enigma, in, the, sense, that, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, were, filled, with, the, most, prosperity, in, cuba, s, history, yet, the, revolutionary, government, hit, full, stride, in, achieving, its, most, organized, form, and, it, adopted, and, enacted, several, brutal, features, of, socialist, regimes, from, the, eastern, bloc, despite, this, it, seems, to, be, a, time, of, prosperity, in, 1972, cuba, joined, comecon, officially, joining, their, trade, with, the, soviet, union, s, socialist, trade, bloc, that, along, with, increased, soviet, subsidies, better, trade, terms, and, better, more, practical, domestic, policy, led, to, several, years, of, prosperous, growth, this, period, also, sees, cuba, strengthening, its, foreign, policy, with, other, communistic, anti, us, imperial, countries, like, nicaragua, this, period, is, marked, as, the, sovietization, of, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, cuba, maintained, close, links, to, the, soviets, until, the, soviet, union, s, collapse, in, 1991, the, end, of, soviet, economic, aid, and, the, loss, of, its, trade, partners, in, the, eastern, bloc, led, to, an, economic, crisis, and, period, of, shortages, known, as, the, special, period, in, cuba, current, day, relations, with, russia, formerly, the, soviet, union, ended, in, 2002, after, the, russian, federation, closed, an, intelligence, base, in, cuba, over, budgetary, concerns, however, in, the, last, decade, relations, have, increased, in, recent, years, after, russia, faced, international, backlash, from, the, west, over, the, situation, in, ukraine, in, 2014, in, retaliation, for, nato, expansion, towards, the, east, russia, has, sought, to, create, these, same, agreements, in, latin, america, russia, has, specifically, sought, greater, ties, with, cuba, nicaragua, venezuela, brazil, and, mexico, currently, these, countries, maintain, close, economic, ties, with, the, united, states, in, 2012, putin, decided, that, russia, focus, its, military, power, in, cuba, like, it, had, in, the, past, putin, is, quoted, saying, our, goal, is, to, expand, russia, s, presence, on, the, global, arms, and, military, equipment, market, this, means, expanding, the, number, of, countries, we, sell, to, and, expanding, the, range, of, goods, and, services, we, offer, the, greatest, threat, presented, by, castro, s, cuba, is, as, an, example, to, other, latin, american, states, which, are, beset, by, poverty, corruption, feudalism, and, plutocratic, exploitation, his, influence, in, latin, america, might, be, overwhelming, and, irresistible, if, with, soviet, help, he, could, establish, in, cuba, a, communist, utopia, walter, lippmann, newsweek, 27, april, 1964, castro, s, victory, and, post, revolutionary, foreign, policy, had, global, repercussions, as, influenced, by, the, expansion, of, the, soviet, union, into, eastern, europe, after, the, 1917, october, revolution, in, line, with, his, call, for, revolution, in, latin, america, and, beyond, against, imperial, powers, laid, out, in, his, declarations, of, havana, castro, immediately, sought, to, export, his, revolution, to, other, countries, in, the, caribbean, and, beyond, sending, weapons, to, algerian, rebels, as, early, as, 1960, in, the, following, decades, cuba, became, heavily, involved, in, supporting, communist, insurgencies, and, independence, movements, in, many, developing, countries, sending, military, aid, to, insurgents, in, ghana, nicaragua, north, yemen, and, angola, among, others, castro, s, intervention, in, the, angolan, civil, war, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, was, particularly, significant, involving, as, many, as, 60, 000, cuban, soldiers, at, the, time, of, the, revolution, various, sectors, of, society, supported, the, revolutionary, movement, from, communists, to, business, leaders, and, the, catholic, church, the, beliefs, of, fidel, castro, during, the, revolution, have, been, the, subject, of, much, historical, debate, fidel, castro, was, openly, ambiguous, about, his, beliefs, at, the, time, some, orthodox, historians, argue, castro, was, a, communist, from, the, beginning, with, a, long, term, plan, however, others, have, argued, he, had, no, strong, ideological, loyalties, leslie, dewart, has, stated, that, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, castro, was, ever, a, communist, agent, levine, and, papasotiriou, believe, castro, believed, in, little, outside, of, a, distaste, for, american, imperialism, as, evidence, for, his, lack, of, communist, leanings, they, note, his, friendly, relations, with, the, united, states, shortly, after, the, revolution, and, him, not, joining, the, cuban, communist, party, during, the, beginning, of, his, land, reforms, at, the, time, of, the, revolution, the, 26th, of, july, movement, involved, people, of, various, political, persuasions, but, most, were, in, agreement, and, desired, the, reinstatement, of, the, 1940, constitution, of, cuba, and, supported, the, ideals, of, jose, marti, che, guevara, commented, to, jorge, masetti, in, an, interview, during, the, revolution, that, fidel, isn, t, a, communist, also, stating, politically, you, can, define, fidel, and, his, movement, as, revolutionary, nationalist, of, course, he, is, anti, american, in, the, sense, that, americans, are, anti, revolutionaries, the, importance, of, women, s, contributions, to, the, cuban, revolution, is, reflected, in, the, very, accomplishments, that, allowed, the, revolution, to, be, successful, from, the, participation, in, the, moncada, barracks, to, the, mariana, grajales, all, women, s,
