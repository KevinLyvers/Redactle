military, history, is, the, study, of, armed, conflict, in, the, history, of, humanity, and, its, impact, on, the, societies, cultures, and, economies, thereof, as, well, as, the, resulting, changes, to, local, and, international, relationships, professional, historians, normally, focus, on, military, affairs, that, had, a, major, impact, on, the, societies, involved, as, well, as, the, aftermath, of, conflicts, while, amateur, historians, and, hobbyists, often, take, a, larger, interest, in, the, details, of, battles, equipment, and, uniforms, in, use, the, essential, subjects, of, military, history, study, are, the, causes, of, war, the, social, and, cultural, foundations, military, doctrine, on, each, side, the, logistics, leadership, technology, strategy, and, tactics, used, and, how, these, changed, over, time, on, the, other, hand, just, war, theory, explores, the, moral, dimensions, of, warfare, and, to, better, limit, the, destructive, reality, caused, by, war, seeks, to, establish, a, doctrine, of, military, ethics, as, an, applied, field, military, history, has, been, studied, at, academies, and, service, schools, because, the, military, command, seeks, to, not, repeat, past, mistakes, and, improve, upon, its, current, performance, by, instilling, an, ability, in, commanders, to, perceive, historical, parallels, during, a, battle, so, as, to, capitalize, on, the, lessons, learned, from, the, past, when, certifying, military, history, instructors, the, combat, studies, institute, deemphasizes, rote, detail, memorization, and, focuses, on, themes, and, context, in, relation, to, current, and, future, conflict, using, the, motto, past, is, prologue, the, discipline, of, military, history, is, dynamic, changing, with, development, as, much, of, the, subject, area, as, the, societies, and, organisations, that, make, use, of, it, the, dynamic, nature, of, the, discipline, of, military, history, is, largely, due, to, the, rapid, change, of, military, forces, and, the, art, and, science, of, managing, them, as, well, as, the, frenetic, pace, of, technological, development, that, had, taken, place, during, the, period, known, as, the, industrial, revolution, and, more, recently, in, the, nuclear, and, information, ages, an, important, recent, concept, is, the, revolution, in, military, affairs, rma, which, attempts, to, explain, how, warfare, has, been, shaped, by, emerging, technologies, such, as, gunpowder, it, highlights, the, short, outbursts, of, rapid, change, followed, by, periods, of, relative, stability, in, terms, of, the, history, profession, in, major, countries, military, history, is, an, orphan, despite, its, enormous, popularity, with, the, general, public, william, h, mcneill, points, out, in, recent, decades, university, level, courses, in, military, history, remain, popular, often, they, use, films, to, humanize, the, combat, experience, for, example, eugene, p, a, scleh, history, professor, at, the, university, of, maine, has, explored, the, advantages, and, problems, of, teaching, a, course, of, modern, war, and, its, images, entirely, through, films, students, said, they, found, the, documentaries, more, valuable, than, the, dramas, however, military, historians, are, frustrated, by, their, marginal, status, in, major, history, departments, academic, historians, concerned, with, military, topics, have, their, own, scholarly, organization, society, for, military, history, since, 1937, it, has, published, the, journal, of, military, history, its, four, issues, a, year, include, scholarly, articles, reviews, of, new, books, and, a, bibliography, of, new, publications, and, dissertations, the, society, has, 2300, members, holds, an, annual, convention, and, gives, out, prizes, for, the, best, scholarship, historiography, is, the, study, of, the, history, and, method, of, the, discipline, of, history, or, the, study, of, a, specialised, topic, in, this, case, military, history, with, an, eye, to, gaining, an, accurate, assessment, of, conflicts, using, all, available, sources, for, this, reason, military, history, is, periodised, creating, overlaying, boundaries, of, study, and, analysis, in, which, descriptions, of, battles, by, leaders, may, be, unreliable, due, to, the, inclination, to, minimize, mention, of, failure, and, exaggerate, success, military, historians, use, historiographical, analysis, in, an, effort, to, allow, an, unbiased, contemporary, view, of, records, one, military, historian, jeremy, black, outlined, problems, 21st, century, military, historians, face, as, an, inheritance, of, their, predecessors, eurocentricity, a, technological, bias, a, focus, on, leading, military, powers, and, dominant, military, systems, the, separation, of, land, from, sea, and, recently, air, conflicts, the, focus, on, state, to, state, conflict, a, lack, of, focus, on, political, tasking, in, how, forces, are, used, if, these, challenges, were, not, sufficient, for, military, historians, the, limits, of, method, are, complicated, by, the, lack, of, records, either, destroyed, or, never, recorded, due, to, their, value, as, a, military, secret, scholars, still, do, not, know, the, exact, nature, of, greek, fire, for, instance, researching, operation, enduring, freedom, and, operation, iraqi, freedom, for, example, have, presented, unique, challenges, to, historians, due, to, records, that, were, destroyed, to, protect, classified, military, information, among, other, reasons, historians, use, their, knowledge, of, government, regulation, and, military, organization, and, employing, a, targeted, and, systematic, research, strategy, to, piece, together, war, histories, despite, these, limits, wars, are, some, of, the, most, studied, and, detailed, periods, of, human, history, military, historians, have, often, compared, organization, tactical, and, strategic, ideas, leadership, and, national, support, of, the, militaries, of, different, nations, in, the, early, 1980s, historian, jeffrey, kimball, studied, the, influence, of, a, historian, s, political, position, on, current, events, on, interpretive, disagreement, regarding, the, causes, of, 20th, century, wars, he, surveyed, the, ideological, preferences, of, 109, active, diplomatic, historians, in, the, united, states, as, well, as, 54, active, military, historians, he, finds, that, their, current, political, views, are, moderately, correlated, with, their, historiographical, interpretations, a, clear, position, on, the, left, right, continuum, regarding, capitalism, was, apparent, in, most, cases, all, groups, agreed, with, the, proposition, historically, americans, have, tended, to, view, questions, of, their, national, security, in, terms, of, such, extremes, as, good, vs, evil, though, the, socialists, were, split, the, other, groups, agreed, that, miscalculation, and, or, misunderstanding, of, the, situation, had, caused, u, s, interventionism, kimball, reports, that, people, interested, in, military, history, from, all, periods, of, time, and, all, subtopics, are, increasingly, turning, to, the, internet, for, many, more, resources, than, are, typically, available, in, nearby, libraries, since, 1993, one, of, the, most, popular, sites, with, over, 4000, members, subscriptions, are, free, has, been, h, war,

they, are, often, organized, from, a, national, point, of, view, where, a, museum, in, a, particular, country, will, have, displays, organized, around, conflicts, in, which, that, country, has, taken, part, they, typically, take, a, broad, view, of, warfare, s, role, in, the, nation, s, history, they, typically, include, displays, of, weapons, and, other, military, equipment, uniforms, wartime, propaganda, and, exhibits, on, civilian, life, during, wartime, and, decorations, among, others, a, military, museum, may, be, dedicated, to, a, particular, or, area, such, as, the, imperial, war,

whether, the, goal, of, providing, diverse, representations, of, war, in, terms, of, positive, and, negative, aspects, of, warfare, war, is, seldom, presented, as, a, good, thing, but, soldiers, are, heavily, praised, david, lowenthal, has, observed, that, in, today, s, museums, nothing, seems, too, horrendous, to, commemorate, yet, as, andrew, whitmarsh, notes, museums, frequently, portray, a, sanitised, version, of, warfare, the, actual, bomber, that, dropped, the, atomic, bomb, on, japan, became, the, focus, of, an, angry, national, controversy, with, veterans, attacking, curators, and, historians, when, the, smithsonian, institution, planned, to, put, its, fuselage, on, public, display, in, 1995, the, uproar, led, to, cancellation, of, the, exhibit, the, documentation, of, military, history, begins, with, the, confrontation, between, sumer, current, iraq, and, elam, current, iran, c, 2700, bc, near, the, modern, basra, other, prominent, records, in, military, history, are, the, trojan, war, in, homer, s, iliad, though, its, historicity, has, been, challenged, the, histories, by, herodotus, 484, 425, bc, who, is, often, called, the, father, of, history, next, was, thucydides, whose, impartiality, despite, being, an, athenian, allowed, him, to, take, advantage, of, his, exile, to, research, the, war, from, different, perspectives, by, carefully, examining, documents, and, interviewing, eyewitnesses, an, approach, centered, on, the, analysis, of, a, leader, was, taken, by, xenophon, 430, 355, bc, in, anabasis, recording, the, expedition, of, cyrus, the, younger, into, anatolia, the, memoirs, of, the, roman, julius, caesar, 100, 44, bc, enable, a, comparative, approach, for, campaigns, such, as, commentarii, de, bello, gallico, and, commentarii, de, bello, civili, the, nature, of, warfare, never, changes, only, its, superficial, manifestations, joshua, and, david, hector, and, achilles, would, recognize, the, combat, that, our, soldiers, and, marines, have, waged, in, the, alleys, of, somalia, and, iraq, the, uniforms, evolve, bronze, gives, way, to, titanium, arrows, may, be, replaced, by, laser, guided, bombs, but, the, heart, of, the, matter, is, still, killing, your, enemies, until, any, survivors, surrender, and, do, your, will, new, weapons, development, can, dramatically, alter, the, face, of, war, the, cost, of, warfare, the, preparations, and, the, training, of, soldiers, and, leaders, a, rule, of, thumb, is, that, if, your, enemy, has, a, potentially, war, winning, weapon, you, have, to, either, match, it, or, neutralize, it, chariots, originated, around, 2000, bc, the, chariot, was, an, effective, fast, weapon, while, one, man, controlled, the, maneuvering, of, the, chariot, a, second, bowman, could, shoot, arrows, at, enemy, soldiers, these, became, crucial, to, the, maintenance, of, several, governments, including, the, new, egyptian, kingdom, and, the, shang, dynasty, and, the, nation, states, of, the, early, to, middle, zhou, dynasty, some, of, the, military, unit, types, and, technologies, which, were, developed, in, the, ancient, world, are, for, settled, agrarian, civilizations, the, infantry, became, the, core, of, military, action, the, infantry, started, as, opposing, armed, groups, of, soldiers, underneath, commanders, the, greeks, and, early, romans, used, rigid, heavily, armed, phalanxes, the, macedonians, and, hellenistic, states, would, adopt, phalanx, formations, with, sarissa, pikemen, the, romans, would, later, adopt, more, flexible, maniples, from, their, neighbors, which, made, them, extremely, successful, in, the, field, of, battle, the, kingdoms, of, the, warring, states, in, east, asia, also, adopted, infantry, combat, a, transition, from, chariot, warfare, from, centuries, earlier, archers, were, a, major, component, of, many, ancient, armies, notably, those, of, the, persians, scythians, egyptians, nubians, indians, chinese, koreans, and, japanese, cavalry, became, an, important, tool, in, the, sicilian, expedition, led, by, athens, in, an, attempt, to, subdue, syracuse, the, well, trained, syracusan, cavalry, became, crucial, to, the, success, of, the, syracusans, macedonian, alexander, the, great, effectively, deployed, his, cavalry, forces, to, secure, victories, in, battles, such, as, the, battle, of, cannae, of, the, second, punic, war, and, the, battle, of, carrhae, of, the, roman, persian, wars, the, importance, of, the, cavalry, would, be, repeated, there, were, also, horse, archers, who, had, the, ability, to, shoot, on, horseback, the, parthians, scythians, mongols, and, other, various, steppe, people, were, especially, fearsome, with, this, tactic, by, the, 3rd, 4th, century, ad, heavily, armored, cavalry, became, widely, adopted, by, the, parthians, sasanians, byzantines, eastern, han, dynasty, and, three, kingdoms, etc, the, early, indo, iranians, developed, the, use, of, chariots, in, warfare, the, scythed, chariot, was, later, invented, in, india, and, soon, adopted, by, the, persians, war, elephants, were, sometimes, deployed, for, fighting, in, ancient, warfare, they, were, first, used, in, india, and, later, adopted, by, the, persians, war, elephants, were, also, used, in, the, battle, of, the, hydaspes, river, and, by, hannibal, in, the, second, punic, war, against, the, romans, one, of, the, most, important, military, transactions, of, the, ancient, world, was, chandragupta, maurya, s, gift, of, 500, elephants, to, seleucus, i, nicator, naval, warfare, was, often, crucial, to, military, success, early, navies, used, sailing, ships, without, cannons, often, the, goal, was, to, ram, the, enemy, ships, and, cause, them, to, sink, there, was, human, oar, power, often, using, slaves, built, up, to, ramming, speed, galleys, were, used, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, by, the, cretans, the, greeks, later, advanced, these, ships, in, 1210, bc, the, first, recorded, naval, battle, was, fought, between, suppiluliuma, ii, king, of, the, hittites, and, cyprus, which, was, defeated, in, the, greco, persian, wars, the, navy, became, of, increasing, importance, triremes, were, involved, in, more, complicated, sea, land, operations, themistocles, helped, to, build, up, a, stronger, greek, navy, composed, of, 310, ships, and, defeated, the, persians, at, the, battle, of, salamis, ending, the, persian, invasion, of, greece, in, the, first, punic, war, the, war, between, carthage, and, rome, started, with, an, advantage, to, carthage, because, of, their, naval, experience, a, roman, fleet, was, built, in, 261, bc, with, the, addition, of, the, corvus, that, allowed, roman, soldiers, to, board, enemy, ships, the, bridge, would, prove, effective, at, the, battle, of, mylae, resulting, in, a, roman, victory, the, vikings, in, the, 8th, century, ad, invented, a, ship, propelled, by, oars, with, a, dragon, decorating, the, prow, hence, called, the, drakkar, the, 12th, century, ad, song, dynasty, invented, ships, with, watertight, bulkhead, compartments, while, the, 2nd, century, bc, han, dynasty, invented, rudders, and, sculled, oars, for, their, warships, fortifications, are, important, in, warfare, early, hill, forts, were, used, to, protect, inhabitants, in, the, iron, age, they, were, primitive, forts, surrounded, by, ditches, filled, with, water, forts, were, then, built, out, of, mud, bricks, stones, wood, and, other, available, materials, romans, used, rectangular, fortresses, built, out, of, wood, and, stone, as, long, as, there, have, been, fortifications, there, have, been, contraptions, to, break, in, dating, back, to, the, times, of, romans, and, earlier, siege, warfare, is, often, necessary, to, capture, forts, some, of, the, military, unit, types, and, technologies, which, were, used, in, the, medieval, period, are, bows, and, arrows, were, often, used, by, combatants, egyptians, shot, arrows, from, chariots, effectively, the, crossbow, was, developed, around, 500, bc, in, china, and, was, used, heavily, in, the, middle, ages, the, english, welsh, longbow, from, the, 12th, century, also, became, important, in, the, middle, ages, it, helped, to, give, the, english, a, large, early, advantage, in, the, hundred, years, war, even, though, the, english, were, eventually, defeated, the, battle, of, cr, cy, and, the, battle, of, agincourt, are, excellent, examples, of, how, to, destroy, an, enemy, using, a, longbow, it, dominated, battlefields, for, over, a, century, there, is, evidence, for, gunpowder, evolving, slowly, from, formulations, by, chinese, alchemists, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, at, first, as, experiments, for, life, force, and, metal, transmutation, and, later, experiments, as, pyrotechnics, and, incendiaries, by, the, 10th, century, the, developments, in, gunpowder, led, to, many, new, weapons, that, were, improved, over, time, the, chinese, used, incendiary, devices, based, on, this, in, siege, warfare, against, the, mongols, starting, in, the, mid, 13th, century, pots, with, wicks, of, flax, or, cotton, were, used, containing, a, combination, of, sulfur, saltpeter, potassium, nitrate, aconitine, oil, resin, ground, charcoal, and, wax, joseph, needham, argued, the, chinese, were, able, to, destroy, buildings, and, walls, using, such, devices, such, experimentation, was, not, present, in, western, europe, where, the, combination, of, saltpeter, sulfur, and, charcoal, were, used, exclusively, for, explosives, and, as, a, propellant, in, firearms, what, the, chinese, often, referred, to, as, the, fire, drug, arrived, in, europe, fully, fleshed, out, as, gunpowder, cannons, were, first, used, in, europe, in, the, early, 14th, century, and, played, a, vital, role, in, the, hundred, years, war, the, first, cannons, were, simply, welded, metal, bars, in, the, form, of, a, cylinder, and, the, first, cannonballs, were, made, of, stone, by, 1346, at, the, battle, of, cr, cy, the, cannon, had, been, used, at, the, battle, of, agincourt, they, would, be, used, again, the, first, infantry, firearms, from, fire, lances, to, hand, cannons, were, held, in, one, hand, while, the, explosive, charge, was, ignited, by, a, lit, match, or, hot, coal, held, in, the, other, hand, in, the, mid, 15th, century, came, the, matchlock, allowing, the, gun, to, be, aimed, and, fired, while, held, steady, with, both, hands, as, used, in, the, arquebus, starting, about, 1500, clever, but, complicated, firing, mechanisms, were, invented, to, generate, sparks, to, ignite, the, powder, instead, of, a, lit, match, starting, with, the, wheel, lock, snaplock, snaphance, and, finally, the, flintlock, mechanism, which, was, simple, and, reliable, becoming, standard, with, the, musket, by, the, early, 17th, century, at, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, the, first, european, fire, ships, were, used, ships, were, filled, with, flammable, materials, set, on, fire, and, sent, to, enemy, lines, this, tactic, was, successfully, used, by, francis, drake, to, scatter, the, spanish, armada, at, the, battle, of, gravelines, and, would, later, be, used, by, the, chinese, russians, greeks, and, several, other, countries, in, naval, battles, naval, mines, were, invented, in, the, 17th, century, though, they, were, not, used, in, great, numbers, until, the, american, civil, war, they, were, used, heavily, in, the, first, and, second, world, wars, air, deployed, naval, mines, were, used, to, mine, the, north, vietnamese, port, of, haiphong, during, the, vietnam, war, the, iraqi, navy, of, saddam, hussein, used, naval, mines, extensively, during, the, tanker, war, as, part, of, the, iran, iraq, war, the, first, navigable, submarine, was, built, in, 1624, by, cornelius, drebbel, it, could, cruise, at, a, depth, of, 15, feet, 5, m, however, the, first, military, submarine, was, constructed, in, 1885, by, isaac, peral, the, turtle, was, developed, by, david, bushnell, during, the, american, revolution, robert, fulton, then, improved, the, submarine, design, by, creating, the, nautilus, the, howitzer, a, type, of, field, artillery, was, developed, in, the, 17th, century, to, fire, high, trajectory, explosive, shells, at, targets, that, could, not, be, reached, by, flat, trajectory, projectiles, organizational, changes, resulting, in, better, training, and, intercommunication, made, the, concept, combined, arms, possible, allowing, the, use, of, infantry, cavalry, and, artillery, in, a, coordinated, way, bayonets, also, became, of, wide, usage, to, infantry, soldiers, bayonet, is, named, after, bayonne, france, where, it, was, first, manufactured, in, the, 16th, century, it, is, used, often, in, infantry, charges, to, fight, in, hand, to, hand, combat, general, jean, martinet, introduced, the, bayonet, to, the, french, army, they, were, used, heavily, in, the, american, civil, war, and, continued, to, be, used, in, modern, wars, like, the, invasion, of, iraq, balloons, were, first, used, in, warfare, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, it, was, first, introduced, in, paris, of, 1783, the, first, balloon, traveled, over, 5, miles, 8, km, previously, military, scouts, could, only, see, from, high, points, on, the, ground, or, from, the, mast, of, a, ship, now, they, could, be, high, in, the, sky, signalling, to, troops, on, the, ground, this, made, it, much, more, difficult, for, troop, movements, to, go, unobserved, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, iron, cased, artillery, rockets, were, successfully, used, militarily, in, india, against, the, british, by, tipu, sultan, of, the, kingdom, of, mysore, during, the, anglo, mysore, wars, rockets, were, generally, inaccurate, at, that, time, though, william, hale, in, 1844, was, able, to, develop, a, better, rocket, the, new, rocket, no, longer, needed, the, rocket, stick, and, had, a, higher, accuracy, in, the, 1860s, there, were, a, series, of, advancements, in, rifles, the, first, repeating, rifle, was, designed, in, 1860, by, a, company, bought, out, by, winchester, which, made, new, and, improved, versions, springfield, rifles, arrived, in, the, mid, 19th, century, also, machine, guns, arrived, in, the, late, 19th, century, automatic, rifles, and, light, machine, guns, first, arrived, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, later, part, of, the, 19th, century, the, self, propelled, torpedo, was, developed, the, hnoms, rap, was, the, world, s, first, torpedo, boat, the, fire, lance, the, predecessor, of, the, gun, was, invented, in, china, between, the, tenth, and, eleventh, century, the, barrel, was, originally, designed, out, of, bamboo, shoots, later, with, metal, joseph, needham, notes, all, the, long, preparations, and, tentative, experiments, were, made, in, china, and, everything, came, to, islam, and, the, west, fully, fledged, whether, it, was, the, fire, lance, or, the, explosive, bomb, the, rocket, or, the, metal, barrel, handgun, and, bombard, by, the, 1320s, europe, had, guns, but, scholars, state, that, the, exact, time, and, method, of, migration, from, china, remains, a, mystery, evidence, of, firearms, is, found, in, iran, and, central, asia, in, the, late, fourteenth, century, it, was, not, until, roughly, 1442, that, guns, were, referenced, in, india, reliable, references, to, guns, in, russia, begins, around, 1382, an, illustration, of, a, pot, shaped, gun, found, in, the, holkham, hall, milemete, manuscript, dated, to, 1326, shows, earliest, advent, of, firearms, in, european, history, the, illustration, shows, an, arrow, set, in, the, pot, shaped, gun, pointed, directly, at, a, structure, archaeological, evidence, of, such, gun, arrows, were, discovered, in, eltz, castle, dated, by, relation, to, a, historical, event, a, feud, with, the, archbishop, of, trier, in, 1331, 36, leading, to, a, siege, seem, to, confirm, again, that, this, was, at, least, one, of, the, types, of, guns, like, the, milemete, used, in, these, very, early, examples, according, to, peter, fraser, purton, the, best, evidence, of, the, earliest, gun, in, europe, is, the, loshult, gun, dated, to, the, fourteenth, century, discovered, in, 1861, the, loshult, was, made, of, bronze, measured, 11, 8, inches, in, length, a, replica, of, the, loshult, was, created, using, similar, gunpowder, compounds, with, present, day, materials, to, determine, the, effectiveness, of, the, weapon, the, gunpowder, research, group, who, designed, the, recreation, found, that, at, high, elevations, the, loshult, could, fire, as, far, as, 1300, meters, though, inaccurate, missing, targets, further, than, 200, meters, the, loshult, could, fire, a, range, of, projectiles, such, as, arrows, and, shot, it, was, determined, that, the, loshult, could, be, effectively, fired, at, ranks, of, soldiers, and, structures, written, works, from, the, cabinet, des, titres, of, the, imperial, library, of, paris, has, found, evidence, of, canons, in, france, in, 1338, the, works, illustrate, canons, being, used, on, board, ships, at, the, rouen, during, that, time, an, iron, fire, arm, which, was, provided, with, forty, eight, bolts, made, of, iron, and, freather, also, one, pound, of, saltpetre, and, half, a, pound, of, sulphur, to, make, the, powder, propel, arrows, researchers, have, been, unable, to, determine, the, sizes, of, these, cannons, and, others, outside, the, artifacts, recovered, sir, henry, brackenbury, was, able, to, surmise, the, approximate, size, of, these, cannons, by, comparing, receipts, for, both, the, firearms, and, the, corresponding, amounts, of, gunpowder, purchased, the, receipts, show, a, transaction, for, 25, livres, for, 5, canons, brackenbury, was, able, to, deduce, when, comparing, the, costs, of, the, cannons, and, the, gunpowder, apportioned, that, they, each, iron, cannon, weighed, approximately, 25, lbs, while, the, brass, cannons, weighed, roughly, 22, lbs, philip, the, bold, 1363, 1404, is, credited, with, creating, the, most, effective, artillery, power, in, europe, in, the, late, fourteenth, century, effectively, creating, the, burgundian, estate, philip, s, development, of, a, large, artillery, army, made, the, small, country, a, reputable, force, against, larger, empires, such, as, england, and, france, philip, had, achieved, this, by, establishing, a, large, scale, artillery, manufacturing, economy, in, burgundy, philip, used, his, new, cache, of, artillery, to, help, the, french, capture, an, english, held, fortress, of, odruik, the, artillery, used, to, take, odruik, used, cannonballs, measuring, to, about, 450, pounds, large, artillery, was, a, major, contributing, factor, to, the, fall, of, constantinople, at, the, hands, of, mehmed, the, conqueror, 1432, 1481, having, resigned, his, position, as, ruler, due, to, youth, and, inexperience, in, 1446, mehmed, moved, to, the, ottoman, capital, of, manisa, after, his, uncle, murad, ii, died, in, 1451, mehmed, once, again, became, sultan, he, turned, his, attention, to, claiming, the, byzantine, capital, constantinople, mehmed, like, philip, started, mass, producing, cannons, by, enticing, craftsmen, to, his, cause, with, money, and, freedom, for, 55, days, constantinople, was, bombarded, with, artillery, fire, throwing, cannonballs, as, large, as, 800, lbs, at, its, walls, on, may, 29, 1453, constantinople, fell, into, ottoman, control, as, guns, and, artillery, became, more, advanced, and, prevalent, so, to, did, the, tactics, by, which, they, were, implemented, according, to, historian, michael, roberts, a, military, revolution, began, with, the, broad, adoption, of, firearms, and, artillery, by, late, sixteenth, century, european, armies, infantry, with, firearms, replaced, cavalry, empires, adapted, their, strongholds, to, withstand, artillery, fire, eventually, drilling, strategies, and, battlefield, tactics, were, adapted, for, the, evolution, in, firearms, use, in, japan, at, the, same, time, during, the, sixteenth, century, this, military, evolution, was, also, taking, hold, these, changes, included, a, universal, adoption, of, firearms, tactical, developments, for, effective, use, logistical, restructuring, within, the, military, itself, and, the, emergence, of, centralized, and, political, and, institutional, relationships, indicative, of, the, early, modern, order, tactically, beginning, with, oda, nobunaga, the, technique, known, as, volleying, or, countermarch, drills, were, implemented, volley, fire, is, an, organized, implementation, of, firearms, where, infantry, are, structured, in, ranks, the, ranks, will, alternate, between, loading, and, firing, positions, allowing, more, consistent, rates, of, fire, and, preventing, enemies, from, taking, over, a, position, while, members, reload, historical, evidence, shows, that, oda, nobunaga, implemented, his, volley, technique, successfully, in, 1575, twenty, years, before, evidence, of, such, a, technique, is, shown, in, europe, the, first, indications, of, the, countermarch, technique, in, europe, was, by, lord, william, louis, of, nassau, 1538, 1574, in, the, mid, 1590s, korea, also, seemed, to, be, adapting, the, volley, technique, earlier, than, even, the, japanese, koreans, seem, to, have, employed, some, kind, of, volley, principle, with, guns, by, 1447, when, the, korean, king, sejong, the, great, instructed, his, gunners, to, shoot, their, fire, barrels, in, squads, of, five, taking, turns, firing, and, loading, this, was, on, display, during, what, kenneth, swope, called, the, first, great, east, asian, war, when, japan, was, trying, to, take, control, and, subjugate, korea, toyotomi, hideyoshi, 1537, 1598, made, a, failed, invasion, of, korea, which, lasted, six, years, eventually, pushed, back, by, the, koreans, with, the, aid, of, ming, china, japan, using, overwhelming, firepower, had, many, early, victories, on, the, korean, peninsulas, though, the, koreans, had, similar, manpower, the, curtain, of, arrows, thrown, up, by, defenders, was, wiped, out, by, gunfire, after, the, japanese, were, finally, pushed, back, in, 1598, sweeping, military, reforms, took, place, in, korea, largely, based, on, updating, and, implementing, the, volley, technique, with, firearms, it, was, qi, jiguang, a, ming, chinese, general, that, provided, the, original, treatise, disseminated, to, koreans, that, aided, in, this, venture, in, these, manuals, qi, gave, detailed, instructions, in, the, use, of, small, group, tactics, psychological, warfare, and, other, modern, techniques, qi, emphasized, repetitive, drilling, dividing, men, into, smaller, groups, separating, the, strong, from, weak, qi, s, ethos, was, one, of, synthesizing, smaller, groups, trained, in, various, tactical, formations, into, larger, companies, battalions, and, armies, by, doing, this, they, could, operate, as, eyes, hands, and, feet, aiding, to, overall, unit, cohesion, at, the, start, of, the, world, wars, various, nations, had, developed, weapons, that, were, a, surprise, to, their, adversaries, leading, to, a, need, to, learn, from, this, and, alter, how, to, combat, them, flame, throwers, were, first, used, in, the, first, world, war, the, french, were, the, first, to, introduce, the, armored, car, in, 1902, then, in, 1918, the, british, produced, the, first, armored, troop, carrier, many, early, tanks, were, proof, of, concept, but, impractical, until, further, development, in, world, war, i, the, british, and, french, held, a, crucial, advantage, due, to, their, superiority, in, tanks, the, germans, had, only, a, few, dozen, a, 7, v, tanks, as, well, as, 170, captured, tanks, the, british, and, french, both, had, several, hundred, each, the, french, tanks, included, the, 13, ton, schneider, ca1, with, a, 75, mm, gun, and, the, british, had, the, mark, iv, and, mark, v, tanks, on, december, 17, 1903, the, wright, brothers, performed, the, first, controlled, powered, heavier, than, air, flight, it, went, 39, meters, 120, ft, in, 1907, the, first, helicopter, flew, but, it, wasn, t, practical, for, usage, aviation, became, important, in, world, war, i, in, which, several, aces, gained, fame, in, 1911, an, aircraft, took, off, from, a, warship, for, the, first, time, landings, on, a, cruiser, were, another, matter, this, led, to, the, development, of, an, aircraft, carrier, with, a, decent, unobstructed, flight, deck, chemical, warfare, exploded, into, the, public, consciousness, in, world, war, i, but, may, have, been, used, in, earlier, wars, without, as, much, human, attention, the, germans, used, gas, filled, shells, at, the, battle, of, bolimov, on, january, 3, 1915, these, were, not, lethal, however, in, april, 1915, the, germans, developed, a, chlorine, gas, that, was, highly, lethal, and, used, it, to, moderate, effect, at, the, second, battle, of, ypres, gas, masks, were, invented, in, matter, of, weeks, and, poison, gas, proved, ineffective, at, winning, battles, it, was, made, illegal, by, all, nations, in, the, 1920s, world, war, ii, gave, rise, to, even, more, technology, the, worth, of, aircraft, grew, from, mostly, reconnaissance, to, strategic, bombing, and, more, the, worth, of, the, aircraft, carrier, was, proved, in, the, battles, between, the, united, states, and, japan, like, the, battle, of, midway, radar, was, independently, invented, by, the, allies, and, axis, powers, it, used, radio, waves, to, detect, objects, molotov, cocktails, were, invented, by, general, franco, in, the, spanish, civil, war, directing, the, nationalists, to, use, them, against, soviet, tanks, in, the, assault, on, toledo, the, atomic, bomb, was, developed, by, the, manhattan, project, and, dropped, on, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, in, 1945, quickly, and, controversially, ending, world, war, ii, during, the, cold, war, the, main, powers, engaged, in, a, nuclear, arms, race, which, comprised, the, making, of, atomic, bombs, hydrogen, bombs, and, more, advanced, nuclear, bombs, in, the, space, race, both, nations, attempted, to, launch, human, beings, into, space, to, the, moon, and, send, satellites, other, technological, advances, were, centered, on, intelligence, like, the, spy, satellite, and, missiles, ballistic, missiles, cruise, missiles, the, nuclear, submarine, was, invented, in, 1955, this, meant, submarines, no, longer, needed, to, surface, as, often, and, could, run, more, quietly, they, evolved, into, underwater, missile, platforms, prehistoric, warfare, refers, to, war, that, occurred, between, societies, without, recorded, history, the, tollense, valley, battlefield, is, the, oldest, evidence, of, a, large, scale, battle, in, europe, more, than, 4, 000, warriors, fought, in, a, battle, on, the, site, in, the, 13th, century, bc, much, of, what, we, know, of, ancient, history, is, the, history, of, militaries, their, conquests, their, movements, and, their, technological, innovations, there, are, many, reasons, for, this, kingdoms, and, empires, the, central, units, of, control, in, the, ancient, world, could, only, be, maintained, through, military, force, due, to, limited, agricultural, ability, there, were, relatively, few, areas, that, could, support, large, communities, therefore, fighting, was, common, the, umma, lagash, war, was, one, of, the, first, wars, in, recorded, history, fought, between, the, sumerian, city, states, of, lagash, and, umma, the, border, conflict, over, the, fertile, guedena, region, lasted, for, several, generations, weapons, and, armor, designed, to, be, sturdy, tended, to, last, longer, than, other, artifacts, and, thus, a, great, deal, of, surviving, artifacts, recovered, tend, to, fall, in, this, category, as, they, are, more, likely, to, survive, weapons, and, armor, were, also, mass, produced, to, a, scale, that, makes, them, quite, plentiful, throughout, history, and, thus, more, likely, to, be, found, in, archaeological, digs, such, items, were, also, considered, signs, of, prosperity, or, virtue, and, thus, were, likely, to, be, placed, in, tombs, and, monuments, to, prominent, warriors, and, writing, when, it, existed, was, often, used, for, kings, to, boast, of, military, conquests, or, victories, writing, when, used, by, the, common, man, also, tended, to, record, such, events, as, major, battles, and, conquests, constituted, major, events, that, many, would, have, considered, worthy, of, recording, either, in, an, epic, such, as, the, homeric, writings, pertaining, to, the, trojan, war, or, even, personal, writings, indeed, the, earliest, stories, center, on, warfare, as, war, was, both, a, common, and, dramatic, aspect, of, life, the, witnessing, of, a, major, battle, involving, many, thousands, of, soldiers, would, be, quite, a, spectacle, even, today, and, thus, considered, worthy, both, of, being, recorded, in, song, and, art, but, also, in, realistic, histories, as, well, as, being, a, central, element, in, a, fictional, work, lastly, as, nation, states, evolved, and, empires, grew, the, increased, need, for, order, and, efficiency, lead, to, an, increase, in, the, number, of, records, and, writings, officials, and, armies, would, have, good, reason, for, keeping, detailed, records, and, accounts, involving, any, and, all, things, concerning, a, matter, such, as, warfare, that, in, the, words, of, sun, tzu, was, a, matter, of, vital, importance, to, the, state, for, all, these, reasons, military, history, comprises, a, large, part, of, ancient, history, notable, militaries, in, the, ancient, world, included, the, egyptians, assyrians, babylonians, persians, ancient, greeks, notably, the, spartans, and, macedonians, kushites, indians, notably, the, magadhas, gangaridais, gandharas, and, cholas, early, imperial, chinese, notably, the, qin, and, han, dynasties, xiongnu, confederation, ancient, romans, and, carthaginians, the, fertile, crescent, of, mesopotamia, was, the, center, of, several, prehistoric, conquests, mesopotamia, was, conquered, by, the, sumerians, akkadians, babylonians, assyrians, and, persians, iranians, were, the, first, nation, to, introduce, cavalry, into, their, army, egypt, began, growing, as, an, ancient, power, but, eventually, fell, to, the, libyans, nubians, assyrians, persians, greeks, romans, byzantines, and, arabs, the, earliest, recorded, battle, in, india, was, the, battle, of, the, ten, kings, the, indian, epics, mahabharata, and, ramayana, are, centered, on, conflicts, and, refer, to, military, formations, theories, of, warfare, and, esoteric, weaponry, chanakya, s, arthashastra, contains, a, detailed, study, on, ancient, warfare, including, topics, on, espionage, and, war, elephants, alexander, the, great, invaded, northwestern, india, and, defeated, king, porus, in, the, battle, of, the, hydaspes, river, the, same, region, was, soon, re, conquered, by, chandragupta, maurya, after, defeating, the, macedonians, and, seleucids, he, also, went, on, to, conquer, the, nanda, empire, and, unify, northern, india, most, of, southern, asia, was, unified, under, his, grandson, ashoka, the, great, after, the, kalinga, war, though, the, empire, collapsed, not, long, after, his, reign, in, china, the, shang, dynasty, and, zhou, dynasty, had, risen, and, collapsed, this, led, to, a, warring, states, period, in, which, several, states, continued, to, fight, with, each, other, over, territory, philosopher, strategists, such, as, confucius, and, sun, tzu, wrote, various, manuscripts, on, ancient, warfare, as, well, as, international, diplomacy, the, warring, states, era, philosopher, mozi, micius, and, his, mohist, followers, invented, various, siege, weapons, and, siegecraft, including, the, cloud, ladder, a, four, wheeled, extendable, ramp, to, scale, fortified, walls, during, a, siege, of, an, enemy, city, the, warring, states, were, first, unified, by, qin, shi, huang, after, a, series, of, military,

constantly, fighting, for, power, after, a, series, of, battles, the, hawaiian, islands, were, united, for, the, first, time, under, a, single, ruler, who, would, become, known, as, kamehameha, i, after, gunpowder, weapons, were, first, developed, in, song, dynasty, china, see, also, technology, of, the, song, dynasty, the, technology, later, spread, west, to, the, ottoman, empire, from, where, it, spread, to, the, safavid, empire, of, persia, and, the, mughal, empire, of, india, the, arquebus, was, later, adopted, by, european, armies, during, the, italian, wars, of, the, early, 16th, century, this, all, brought, an, end, to, the, dominance, of, armored, cavalry, on, the, battlefield, the, simultaneous, decline, of, the, feudal, system, and, the, absorption, of, the, medieval, city, states, into, larger, states, allowed, the, creation, of, professional, standing, armies, to, replace, the, feudal, levies, and, mercenaries, that, had, been, the, standard, military, component, of, the, middle, ages, in, africa, ahmad, ibn, ibrihim, al, ghazi, was, the, first, african, commander, to, use, gunpowder, on, the, continent, in, the, ethiopian, adal, war, that, lasted, for, fourteen, years, 1529, 1543, the, period, spanning, between, the, 1648, peace, of, westphalia, and, the, 1789, french, revolution, is, also, known, as, kabinettskriege, princes, warfare, as, wars, were, mainly, carried, out, by, imperial, or, monarchics, states, decided, by, cabinets, and, limited, in, scope, and, in, their, aims, they, also, involved, quickly, shifting, alliances, and, mainly, used, mercenaries, over, the, course, of, the, 18th, 19th, centuries, all, military, arms, and, services, underwent, significant, developments, that, included, a, more, mobile, field, artillery, the, transition, from, use, of, battalion, infantry, drill, in, close, order, to, open, order, formations, and, the, transfer, of, emphasis, from, the, use, of, bayonets, to, the, rifle, that, replaced, the, musket, and, virtual, replacement, of, all, types, of, cavalry, with, the, universal, dragoons, or, mounted, infantry, the, military, revolution, is, a, conceptual, schema, for, explaining, the, transformation, of, european, military, strategy, tactics, and, technology, in, the, early, modern, period, the, argument, is, that, dramatic, advances, in, technology, government, finance, and, public, administration, transformed, and, modernized, european, armies, tactics, and, logistics, since, warfare, was, so, central, to, the, european, state, the, transformation, had, a, major, impact, on, modernizing, government, bureaucracies, taxation, and, the, national, economy, the, concept, was, introduced, by, michael, roberts, in, the, 1950s, as, he, focused, on, sweden, 1560, 1660, roberts, emphasized, the, introduction, of, muskets, that, could, not, be, aimed, at, small, targets, but, could, be, very, effective, when, fired, in, volleys, by, three, ranks, of, infantry, soldiers, with, one, firing, while, the, other, two, ranks, reloaded, all, three, ranks, march, forward, to, demolish, the, enemy, the, infantry, now, had, the, firepower, that, had, been, reserved, to, the, artillery, and, had, mobility, that, could, rapidly, advance, in, the, battlefield, which, the, artillery, lacked, the, infantry, thereby, surpassed, the, artillery, in, tactical, maneuvering, on, the, battlefield, roberts, linked, these, advances, with, larger, historical, consequences, arguing, that, innovations, in, tactics, drill, and, doctrine, by, the, dutch, and, swedes, 1560, 1660, led, to, a, need, for, more, and, better, trained, troops, and, thus, for, permanent, forces, standing, armies, armies, grew, much, larger, and, more, expensive, these, changes, in, turn, had, major, political, consequences, in, the, level, of, administrative, support, and, the, supply, of, money, men, and, provisions, producing, new, financial, demands, and, the, creation, of, new, governmental, institutions, thus, argued, roberts, the, modern, art, of, war, made, possible, and, necessary, the, creation, of, the, modern, state, in, the, 1990s, the, concept, was, modified, and, extended, by, geoffrey, parker, who, argued, that, developments, in, fortification, and, siege, warfare, caused, the, revolution, the, concept, of, a, military, revolution, based, upon, technology, has, given, way, to, models, based, more, on, a, slow, evolution, in, which, technology, plays, a, minor, role, to, organization, command, and, control, logistics, and, in, general, non, material, improvements, the, revolutionary, nature, of, these, changes, was, only, visible, after, a, long, evolution, that, handed, europe, a, predominant, place, in, warfare, a, place, that, the, industrial, revolution, would, confirm, the, concept, of, a, military, revolution, in, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, has, received, a, mixed, reception, among, historians, noted, military, historians, michael, duffy, and, jeremy, black, have, strongly, criticised, it, as, misleading, exaggerated, and, simplistic, as, weapons, particularly, small, arms, became, easier, to, use, countries, began, to, abandon, a, complete, reliance, on, professional, soldiers, in, favor, of, conscription, technological, advances, became, increasingly, important, while, the, armies, of, the, previous, period, had, usually, had, similar, weapons, the, industrial, age, saw, encounters, such, as, the, battle, of, sadowa, in, which, possession, of, a, more, advanced, technology, played, a, decisive, role, in, the, outcome, conscription, was, employed, in, industrial, warfare, to, increase, the, number, of, military, personnel, that, were, available, for, combat, conscription, was, notably, used, by, napoleon, bonaparte, and, the, major, parties, during, the, two, world, wars, total, war, was, used, in, industrial, warfare, the, objective, being, to, prevent, the, opposing, nation, to, engage, in, war, napoleon, was, the, innovator, william, tecumseh, sherman, s, march, to, the, sea, and, philip, sheridan, s, burning, of, the, shenandoah, valley, during, the, american, civil, war, were, examples, on, the, largest, scale, the, strategic, bombing, of, enemy, cities, and, industrial, factories, during, world, war, ii, was, total, warfare, since, the, 1940s, preparation, for, a, major, war, has, been, based, on, technological, arms, races, involving, all, sorts, of, new, weapons, systems, such, as, nuclear, and, biological, as, well, as, computerized, control, systems, and, the, opening, of, new, venues, such, as, seen, in, the, space, race, involving, the, united, states, the, soviet, union, and, more, recently, china, modern, war, also, saw, the, improvement, of, armored, tank, technology, while, tanks, were, present, in, the, first, world, war, and, the, second, world, war, armored, warfare, technology, came, to, a, head, with, the, start, of, the, cold, war, many, of, the, technologies, commonly, seen, on, main, battle, tanks, today, such, as, composite, armor, high, caliber, cannons, and, advanced, targeting, systems, would, be, developed, during, this, time, a, distinctive, feature, since, 1945, is, the, absence, of, wars, between, major, powers, indeed, the, near, absence, of, any, traditional, wars, between, established, countries, the, major, exceptions, were, the, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1971, the, iran, iraq, war, 1980, 1988, and, the, gulf, war, of, 1990, 91, instead, actual, fighting, has, largely, been, a, matter, of, civil, wars, and, insurgencies, the, most, recent, example, of, a, war, between, two, nation, states, would, be, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine
