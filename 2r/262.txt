the, yuan, dynasty, the, golden, horde, lost, touch, with, mongolia, and, china, while, the, two, main, parts, of, the, chagatai, khanate, were, defeated, by, timur, tamerlane, 1336, 1405, who, founded, the, timurid, empire, however, remnants, of, the, chagatai, khanate, survived, the, last, chagataid, state, to, survive, was, the, yarkent, khanate, until, its, defeat, by, the, oirat,

khanates, such, as, the, khanate, of, bukhara, and, the, kazakh, khanate, lasted, even, longer, the, number, of, troops, mustered, by, the, mongols, is, the, subject, of, some, scholarly, debate, but, was, at, least, 105, 000, in, 1206, the, mongol, military, organization, was, simple, but, effective, based, on, the, decimal, system, the, army, was, built, up, from, squads, of, ten, men, each, arbans, 10, people, zuuns, 100, mingghans, 1000, and, tumens, 10, 000, the, mongols, were, most, famous, for, their, horse, archers, but, troops, armed, with, lances, were, equally, skilled, and, the, mongols, recruited, other, military, specialists, from, the, lands, they, conquered, with, experienced, chinese, engineers, and, a, bombardier, corps, which, was, expert, at, building, trebuchets, catapults, and, other, machines, the, mongols, could, lay, siege, to, fortified, positions, sometimes, building, machinery, on, the, spot, using, available, local, resources, forces, under, the, command, of, the, mongol, empire, were, trained, organized, and, equipped, for, mobility, and, speed, mongol, soldiers, were, more, lightly, armored, than, many, of, the, armies, they, faced, but, were, able, to, make, up, for, it, with, maneuverability, each, mongol, warrior, would, usually, travel, with, multiple, horses, allowing, him, to, quickly, switch, to, a, fresh, mount, as, needed, in, addition, soldiers, of, the, mongol, army, functioned, independently, of, supply, lines, considerably, speeding, up, army, movement, skillful, use, of, couriers, enabled, the, leaders, of, these, armies, to, maintain, contact, with, each, other, discipline, was, inculcated, during, a, nerge, traditional, hunt, as, reported, by, juvayni, these, hunts, were, distinctive, from, hunts, in, other, cultures, being, the, equivalent, to, small, unit, actions, mongol, forces, would, spread, out, in, a, line, surround, an, entire, region, and, then, drive, all, of, the, game, within, that, area, together, the, goal, was, to, let, none, of, the, animals, escape, and, to, slaughter, them, all, another, advantage, of, the, mongols, was, their, ability, to, traverse, large, distances, even, in, unusually, cold, winters, for, instance, frozen, rivers, led, them, like, highways, to, large, urban, centers, on, their, banks, the, mongols, were, adept, at, river, work, crossing, the, river, saj,

rarely, used, naval, power, in, the, 1260s, and, 1270s, they, used, seapower, while, conquering, the, song, dynasty, of, china, though, their, attempts, to, mount, seaborne, campaigns, against, japan, were, unsuccessful, around, the, eastern, mediterranean, their, campaigns, were, almost, exclusively, land, based, with, the, seas, controlled, by, the, crusader, and, mamluk, forces, all, military, campaigns, were, preceded, by, careful, planning, reconnaissance, and, the, gathering, of, sensitive, information, relating, to, enemy, territories, and, forces, the, success, organization, and, mobility, of, the, mongol, armies, permitted, them, to, fight, on, several, fronts, at, once, all, adult, males, up, to, the, age, of, 60, were, eligible, for, conscription, into, the, army, a, source, of, honor, in, their, tribal, warrior, tradition, the, mongol, empire, was, governed, by, a, code, of, law, devised, by, genghis, called, yassa, meaning, order, or, decree, a, particular, canon, of, this, code, was, that, those, of, rank, shared, much, the, same, hardship, as, the, common, man, it, also, imposed, severe, penalties, e, g, the, death, penalty, if, one, mounted, soldier, following, another, did, not, pick, up, something, dropped, from, the, mount, in, front, penalties, were, also, decreed, for, rape, and, to, some, extent, for, murder, any, resistance, to, mongol, rule, was, met, with, massive, collective, punishment, cities, were, destroyed, and, their, inhabitants, slaughtered, if, they, defied, mongol, orders, under, yassa, chiefs, and, generals, were, selected, based, on, merit, the, empire, was, governed, by, a, non, democratic, parliamentary, style, central, assembly, called, kurultai, in, which, the, mongol, chiefs, met, with, the, great, khan, to, discuss, domestic, and, foreign, policies, kurultais, were, also, convened, for, the, selection, of, each, new, great, khan, the, mongols, imported, central, asian, muslims, to, serve, as, administrators, in, china, and, sent, han, chinese, and, khitans, from, china, to, serve, as, administrators, over, the, muslim, population, in, bukhara, in, central, asia, thus, using, foreigners, to, curtail, the, power, of, the, local, peoples, of, both, lands, at, the, time, of, genghis, khan, virtually, every, religion, had, found, mongol, converts, from, buddhism, to, christianity, from, manichaeism, to, islam, to, avoid, strife, genghis, khan, set, up, an, institution, that, ensured, complete, religious, freedom, though, he, himself, was, a, shamanist, under, his, administration, all, religious, leaders, were, exempt, from, taxation, and, from, public, service, initially, there, were, few, formal, places, of, worship, because, of, the, nomadic, lifestyle, however, under, gedei, 1186, 1241, several, building, projects, were, undertaken, in, the, mongol, capital, along, with, palaces, gedei, built, houses, of, worship, for, the, buddhist, muslim, christian, and, taoist, followers, the, dominant, religions, at, that, time, were, tengrism, and, buddhism, although, gedei, s, wife, was, a, nestorian, christian, eventually, each, of, the, successor, states, adopted, the,

sent, them, far, afield, in, an, ortoq, merchant, partner, arrangement, in, mongol, times, the, contractual, features, of, a, mongol, ortoq, partnership, closely, resembled, that, of, qirad, and,

the, characters, of, the, old, uyghur, which, is, still, used, in, mongolia, today, some, of, the, other, long, term, consequences, of, the, mongol, empire, include, n, this, region, nomadism, really, did, attempt, and, really, did, to, a, very, considerable, degree, succeed, in, its, attempt, to, stamp, a, settled, civilized, system, out, of, existence, when, jengis, khan, first, invaded, china, we, are, told, that, there, was, a, serious, discussion, among, the, mongol, chiefs, whether, all, the, towns, and, settled, populations, should, not, be, destroyed, to, these, simple, practitioners, of, the, open, air, life, the, settled, populations, seemed, corrupt, crowded, vicious, effeminate, dangerous, and, incomprehensible, a, detestable, human, efflorescence, upon, what, would, otherwise, have, been, good, pasture, they, had, no, use, whatever, for, the, towns, but, it, was, only, under, hulagu, in, mesopotamia, that, these, ideas, seem, to, have, been, embodied, in, a, deliberate, policy, the, mongols, here, did, not, only, burn, and, massacre, they, destroyed, the, irrigation, system, that, had, endured, for, at, least, eight, thousand, years, and, with, that, the, mother, civilization, of, all, the, western, world, came, to, an, end
