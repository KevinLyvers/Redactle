heraldry, is, a, discipline, relating, to, the, design, display, and, study, of, armorial, bearings, known, as, armory, as, well, as, related, disciplines, such, as, vexillology, together, with, the, study, of, ceremony, rank, and, pedigree, armory, the, best, known, branch, of, heraldry, concerns, the, design, and, transmission, of, the, heraldic, achievement, the, achievement, or, armorial, bearings, usually, includes, a, coat, of, arms, on, a, shield, helmet, and, crest, together, with, any, accompanying, devices, such, as, supporters, badges, heraldic, banners, and, mottoes, although, the, use, of, various, devices, to, signify, individuals, and, groups, goes, back, to, antiquity, both, the, form, and, use, of, such, devices, varied, widely, as, the, concept, of, regular, hereditary, designs, constituting, the, distinguishing, feature, of, heraldry, did, not, develop, until, the, high, middle, ages, it, is, often, claimed, that, the, use, of, helmets, with, face, guards, during, this, period, made, it, difficult, to, recognize, one, s, commanders, in, the, field, when, large, armies, gathered, together, for, extended, periods, necessitating, the, development, of, heraldry, as, a, symbolic, language, but, there, is, little, support, for, this, view, the, perceived, beauty, and, pageantry, of, heraldic, designs, allowed, them, to, survive, the, gradual, abandonment, of, armour, on, the, battlefield, during, the, seventeenth, century, heraldry, has, been, described, poetically, as, the, handmaid, of, history, the, shorthand, of, history, and, the, floral, border, in, the, garden, of, history, in, modern, times, individuals, public, and, private, organizations, corporations, cities, towns, regions, and, other, entities, use, heraldry, and, its, conventions, to, symbolize, their, heritage, achievements, and, aspirations, various, symbols, have, been, used, to, represent, individuals, or, groups, for, thousands, of, years, the, earliest, representations, of, distinct, persons, and, regions, in, egyptian, art, show, the, use, of, standards, topped, with, the, images, or, symbols, of, various, gods, and, the, names, of, kings, appear, upon, emblems, known, as, serekhs, representing, the, king, s, palace, and, usually, topped, with, a, falcon, representing, the, god, horus, of, whom, the, king, was, regarded, as, the, earthly, incarnation, similar, emblems, and, devices, are, found, in, ancient, mesopotamian, art, of, the, same, period, and, the, precursors, of, heraldic, beasts, such, as, the, griffin, can, also, be, found, in, the, bible, the, book, of, numbers, refers, to, the, standards, and, ensigns, of, the, children, of, israel, who, were, commanded, to, gather, beneath, these, emblems, and, declare, their, pedigrees, the, greek, and, latin, writers, frequently, describe, the, shields, and, symbols, of, various, heroes, and, units, of, the, roman, army, were, sometimes, identified, by, distinctive, markings, on, their, shields, at, least, one, pre, historic, european, object, the, nebra, sky, disc, is, also, thought, to, serve, as, a, heraldic, precursor, until, the, nineteenth, century, it, was, common, for, heraldic, writers, to, cite, examples, such, as, these, and, metaphorical, symbols, such, as, the, lion, of, judah, or, eagle, of, the, caesars, as, evidence, of, the, antiquity, of, heraldry, itself, and, to, infer, therefrom, that, the, great, figures, of, ancient, history, bore, arms, representing, their, noble, status, and, descent, the, book, of, saint, albans, compiled, in, 1486, declares, that, christ, himself, was, a, gentleman, of, coat, armour, these, claims, are, now, regarded, as, the, fantasy, of, medieval, heralds, as, there, is, no, evidence, of, a, distinctive, symbolic, language, akin, to, that, of, heraldry, during, this, early, period, nor, do, many, of, the, shields, described, in, antiquity, bear, a, close, resemblance, to, those, of, medieval, heraldry, nor, is, there, any, evidence, that, specific, symbols, or, designs, were, passed, down, from, one, generation, to, the, next, representing, a, particular, person, or, line, of, descent, the, medieval, heralds, also, devised, arms, for, various, knights, and, lords, from, history, and, literature, notable, examples, include, the, toads, attributed, to, pharamond, the, cross, and, martlets, of, edward, the, confessor, and, the, various, arms, attributed, to, the, nine, worthies, and, the, knights, of, the, round, table, these, too, are, readily, dismissed, as, fanciful, inventions, rather, than, evidence, of, the, antiquity, of, heraldry, the, development, of, the, modern, heraldic, language, cannot, be, attributed, to, a, single, individual, time, or, place, although, certain, designs, that, are, now, considered, heraldic, were, evidently, in, use, during, the, eleventh, century, most, accounts, and, depictions, of, shields, up, to, the, beginning, of, the, twelfth, century, contain, little, or, no, evidence, of, their, heraldic, character, for, example, the, bayeux, tapestry, illustrating, the, norman, invasion, of, england, in, 1066, and, probably, commissioned, about, 1077, when, the, cathedral, of, bayeux, was, rebuilt, depicts, a, number, of, shields, of, various, shapes, and, designs, many, of, which, are, plain, while, others, are, decorated, with, dragons, crosses, or, other, typically, heraldic, figures, yet, no, individual, is, depicted, twice, bearing, the, same, arms, nor, are, any, of, the, descendants, of, the, various, persons, depicted, known, to, have, borne, devices, resembling, those, in, the, tapestry, similarly, an, account, of, the, french, knights, at, the, court, of, the, byzantine, emperor, alexius, i, at, the, beginning, of, the, twelfth, century, describes, their, shields, of, polished, metal, devoid, of, heraldic, design, a, spanish, manuscript, from, 1109, describes, both, plain, and, decorated, shields, none, of, which, appears, to, have, been, heraldic, the, abbey, of, st, denis, contained, a, window, commemorating, the, knights, who, embarked, on, the, second, crusade, in, 1147, and, was, probably, made, soon, after, the, event, but, montfaucon, s, illustration, of, the, window, before, it, was, destroyed, shows, no, heraldic, design, on, any, of, the, shields, in, england, from, the, time, of, the, norman, conquest, official, documents, had, to, be, sealed, beginning, in, the, twelfth, century, seals, assumed, a, distinctly, heraldic, character, a, number, of, seals, dating, from, between, 1135, and, 1155, appear, to, show, the, adoption, of, heraldic, devices, in, england, france, germany, spain, and, italy, a, notable, example, of, an, early, armorial, seal, is, attached, to, a, charter, granted, by, philip, i, count, of, flanders, in, 1164, seals, from, the, latter, part, of, the, eleventh, and, early, twelfth, centuries, show, no, evidence, of, heraldic, symbolism, but, by, the, end, of, the, twelfth, century, seals, are, uniformly, heraldic, in, nature, one, of, the, earliest, known, examples, of, armory, as, it, subsequently, came, to, be, practiced, can, be, seen, on, the, tomb, of, geoffrey, plantagenet, count, of, anjou, who, died, in, 1151, an, enamel, probably, commissioned, by, geoffrey, s, widow, between, 1155, and, 1160, depicts, him, carrying, a, blue, shield, decorated, with, six, golden, lions, rampant, he, wears, a, blue, helmet, adorned, with, another, lion, and, his, cloak, is, lined, in, vair, a, medieval, chronicle, states, that, geoffrey, was, given, a, shield, of, this, description, when, he, was, knighted, by, his, father, in, law, henry, i, in, 1128, but, this, account, probably, dates, to, about, 1175, the, earlier, heraldic, writers, attributed, the, lions, of, england, to, william, the, conqueror, but, the, earliest, evidence, of, the, association, of, lions, with, the, english, crown, is, a, seal, bearing, two, lions, passant, used, by, the, future, king, john, during, the, lifetime, of, his, father, henry, ii, who, died, in, 1189, since, henry, was, the, son, of, geoffrey, plantagenet, it, seems, reasonable, to, suppose, that, the, adoption, of, lions, as, an, heraldic, emblem, by, henry, or, his, sons, might, have, been, inspired, by, geoffrey, s, shield, john, s, elder, brother, richard, the, lionheart, who, succeeded, his, father, on, the, throne, is, believed, to, have, been, the, first, to, have, borne, the, arms, of, three, lions, passant, guardant, still, the, arms, of, england, having, earlier, used, two, lions, rampant, combatant, which, arms, may, also, have, belonged, to, his, father, richard, is, also, credited, with, having, originated, the, english, crest, of, a, lion, statant, now, statant, guardant, the, origins, of, heraldry, are, sometimes, associated, with, the, crusades, a, series, of, military, campaigns, undertaken, by, christian, armies, from, 1096, to, 1487, with, the, goal, of, reconquering, jerusalem, and, other, former, byzantine, territories, captured, by, muslim, forces, during, the, seventh, century, while, there, is, no, evidence, that, heraldic, art, originated, in, the, course, of, the, crusades, there, is, no, reason, to, doubt, that, the, gathering, of, large, armies, drawn, from, across, europe, for, a, united, cause, would, have, encouraged, the, adoption, of, armorial, bearings, as, a, means, of, identifying, one, s, commanders, in, the, field, or, that, it, helped, disseminate, the, principles, of, armory, across, europe, at, least, two, distinctive, features, of, heraldry, are, generally, accepted, as, products, of, the, crusaders, the, surcoat, an, outer, garment, worn, over, the, armor, to, protect, the, wearer, from, the, heat, of, the, sun, was, often, decorated, with, the, same, devices, that, appeared, on, a, knight, s, shield, it, is, from, this, garment, that, the, phrase, coat, of, arms, is, derived, also, the, lambrequin, or, mantling, that, depends, from, the, helmet, and, frames, the, shield, in, modern, heraldry, began, as, a, practical, covering, for, the, helmet, and, the, back, of, the, neck, during, the, crusades, serving, much, the, same, function, as, the, surcoat, its, slashed, or, scalloped, edge, today, rendered, as, billowing, flourishes, is, thought, to, have, originated, from, hard, wearing, in, the, field, or, as, a, means, of, deadening, a, sword, blow, and, perhaps, entangling, the, attacker, s, weapon, the, spread, of, armorial, bearings, across, europe, gave, rise, to, a, new, occupation, the, herald, originally, a, type, of, messenger, employed, by, noblemen, assumed, the, responsibility, of, learning, and, knowing, the, rank, pedigree, and, heraldic, devices, of, various, knights, and, lords, as, well, as, the, rules, governing, the, design, and, description, or, blazoning, of, arms, and, the, precedence, of, their, bearers, as, early, as, the, late, thirteenth, century, certain, heralds, in, the, employ, of, monarchs, were, given, the, title, king, of, heralds, which, eventually, became, king, of, arms, in, the, earliest, period, arms, were, assumed, by, their, bearers, without, any, need, for, heraldic, authority, however, by, the, middle, of, the, fourteenth, century, the, principle, that, only, a, single, individual, was, entitled, to, bear, a, particular, coat, of, arms, was, generally, accepted, and, disputes, over, the, ownership, of, arms, seems, to, have, led, to, gradual, establishment, of, heraldic, authorities, to, regulate, their, use, the, earliest, known, work, of, heraldic, jurisprudence, de, insigniis, et, armis, was, written, about, 1350, by, bartolus, de, saxoferrato, a, professor, of, law, at, the, university, of, padua, the, most, celebrated, armorial, dispute, in, english, heraldry, is, that, of, scrope, v, grosvenor, 1390, in, which, two, different, men, claimed, the, right, to, bear, azure, a, bend, or, the, continued, proliferation, of, arms, and, the, number, of, disputes, arising, from, different, men, assuming, the, same, arms, led, henry, v, to, issue, a, proclamation, in, 1419, forbidding, all, those, who, had, not, borne, arms, at, the, battle, of, agincourt, from, assuming, arms, except, by, inheritance, or, a, grant, from, the, crown, beginning, in, the, reign, of, henry, viii, of, england, the, english, kings, of, arms, were, commanded, to, make, visitations, in, which, they, traveled, about, the, country, recording, arms, borne, under, proper, authority, and, requiring, those, who, bore, arms, without, authority, either, to, obtain, authority, for, them, or, cease, their, use, arms, borne, improperly, were, to, be, taken, down, and, defaced, the, first, such, visitation, began, in, 1530, and, the, last, was, carried, out, in, 1700, although, no, new, commissions, to, carry, out, visitations, were, made, after, the, accession, of, william, iii, in, 1689, there, is, little, evidence, that, scottish, heralds, ever, went, on, visitations, in, 1484, during, the, reign, of, richard, iii, the, various, heralds, employed, by, the, crown, were, incorporated, into, england, s, college, of, arms, through, which, all, new, grants, of, arms, would, eventually, be, issued, the, college, currently, consists, of, three, kings, of, arms, assisted, by, six, heralds, and, four, pursuivants, or, junior, officers, of, arms, all, under, the, authority, of, the, earl, marshal, but, all, of, the, arms, granted, by, the, college, are, granted, by, the, authority, of, the, crown, in, scotland, court, of, the, lord, lyon, king, of, arms, oversees, the, heraldry, and, holds, court, sessions, which, are, an, official, part, of, scotland, s, court, system, similar, bodies, regulate, the, granting, of, arms, in, other, monarchies, and, several, members, of, the, commonwealth, of, nations, but, in, most, other, countries, there, is, no, heraldic, authority, and, no, law, preventing, anyone, from, assuming, whatever, arms, they, please, provided, that, they, do, not, infringe, upon, the, arms, of, another, although, heraldry, originated, from, military, necessity, it, soon, found, itself, at, home, in, the, pageantry, of, the, medieval, tournament, the, opportunity, for, knights, and, lords, to, display, their, heraldic, bearings, in, a, competitive, medium, led, to, further, refinements, such, as, the, development, of, elaborate, tournament, helms, and, further, popularized, the, art, of, heraldry, throughout, europe, prominent, burghers, and, corporations, including, many, cities, and, towns, assumed, or, obtained, grants, of, arms, with, only, nominal, military, associations, heraldic, devices, were, depicted, in, various, contexts, such, as, religious, and, funerary, art, and, in, using, a, wide, variety, of, media, including, stonework, carved, wood, enamel, stained, glass, and, embroidery, as, the, rise, of, firearms, rendered, the, mounted, knight, increasingly, irrelevant, during, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, and, the, tournament, faded, into, history, the, military, character, of, heraldry, gave, way, to, its, use, as, a, decorative, art, freed, from, the, limitations, of, actual, shields, and, the, need, for, arms, to, be, easily, distinguished, in, combat, heraldic, artists, designed, increasingly, elaborate, achievements, culminating, in, the, development, of, landscape, heraldry, incorporating, realistic, depictions, of, landscapes, during, the, latter, part, of, the, eighteenth, and, early, part, of, the, nineteenth, century, these, fell, out, of, fashion, during, the, mid, nineteenth, century, when, a, renewed, interest, in, the, history, of, armory, led, to, the, re, evaluation, of, earlier, designs, and, a, new, appreciation, for, the, medieval, origins, of, the, art, in, particular, a, late, use, of, heraldic, imagery, has, been, in, patriotic, commemorations, and, nationalistic, propaganda, during, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, since, the, late, nineteenth, century, heraldry, has, focused, on, the, use, of, varied, lines, of, partition, and, little, used, ordinaries, to, produce, new, and, unique, designs, a, heraldic, achievement, consists, of, a, shield, of, arms, the, coat, of, arms, or, simply, coat, together, with, all, of, its, accompanying, elements, such, as, a, crest, supporters, and, other, heraldic, embellishments, the, term, coat, of, arms, technically, refers, to, the, shield, of, arms, itself, but, the, phrase, is, commonly, used, to, refer, to, the, entire, achievement, the, one, indispensable, element, of, a, coat, of, arms, is, the, shield, many, ancient, coats, of, arms, consist, of, nothing, else, but, no, achievement, or, armorial, bearings, exists, without, a, coat, of, arms, from, a, very, early, date, illustrations, of, arms, were, frequently, embellished, with, helmets, placed, above, the, shields, these, in, turn, came, to, be, decorated, with, fan, shaped, or, sculptural, crests, often, incorporating, elements, from, the, shield, of, arms, as, well, as, a, wreath, or, torse, or, sometimes, a, coronet, from, which, depended, the, lambrequin, or, mantling, to, these, elements, modern, heraldry, often, adds, a, motto, displayed, on, a, ribbon, typically, below, the, shield, the, helmet, is, borne, of, right, and, forms, no, part, of, a, grant, of, arms, it, may, be, assumed, without, authority, by, anyone, entitled, to, bear, arms, together, with, mantling, and, whatever, motto, the, armiger, may, desire, the, crest, however, together, with, the, torse, or, coronet, from, which, it, arises, must, be, granted, or, confirmed, by, the, relevant, heraldic, authority, if, the, bearer, is, entitled, to, the, ribbon, collar, or, badge, of, a, knightly, order, it, may, encircle, or, depend, from, the, shield, some, arms, particularly, those, of, the, nobility, are, further, embellished, with, supporters, heraldic, figures, standing, alongside, or, behind, the, shield, often, these, stand, on, a, compartment, typically, a, mound, of, earth, and, grass, on, which, other, badges, symbols, or, heraldic, banners, may, be, displayed, the, most, elaborate, achievements, sometimes, display, the, entire, coat, of, arms, beneath, a, pavilion, an, embellished, tent, or, canopy, of, the, type, associated, with, the, medieval, tournament, though, this, is, only, very, rarely, found, in, english, or, scots, achievements, the, primary, element, of, a, heraldic, achievement, is, the, shield, or, escutcheon, upon, which, the, coat, of, arms, is, depicted, all, of, the, other, elements, of, an, achievement, are, designed, to, decorate, and, complement, these, arms, but, only, the, shield, of, arms, is, required, the, shape, of, the, shield, like, many, other, details, is, normally, left, to, the, discretion, of, the, heraldic, artist, and, many, different, shapes, have, prevailed, during, different, periods, of, heraldic, design, and, in, different, parts, of, europe, one, shape, alone, is, normally, reserved, for, a, specific, purpose, the, lozenge, a, diamond, shaped, escutcheon, was, traditionally, used, to, display, the, arms, of, women, on, the, grounds, that, shields, as, implements, of, war, were, inappropriate, for, this, purpose, this, distinction, was, not, always, strictly, adhered, to, and, a, general, exception, was, usually, made, for, sovereigns, whose, arms, represented, an, entire, nation, sometimes, an, oval, shield, or, cartouche, was, substituted, for, the, lozenge, this, shape, was, also, widely, used, for, the, arms, of, clerics, in, french, spanish, and, italian, heraldry, although, it, was, never, reserved, for, their, use, in, recent, years, the, use, of, the, cartouche, for, women, s, arms, has, become, general, in, scottish, heraldry, while, both, scottish, and, irish, authorities, have, permitted, a, traditional, shield, under, certain, circumstances, and, in, canadian, heraldry, the, shield, is, now, regularly, granted, the, whole, surface, of, the, escutcheon, is, termed, the, field, which, may, be, plain, consisting, of, a, single, tincture, or, divided, into, multiple, sections, of, differing, tinctures, by, various, lines, of, partition, and, any, part, of, the, field, may, be, sem, or, powdered, with, small, charges, the, edges, and, adjacent, parts, of, the, escutcheon, are, used, to, identify, the, placement, of, various, heraldic, charges, the, upper, edge, and, the, corresponding, upper, third, of, the, shield, are, referred, to, as, the, chief, the, lower, part, is, the, base, the, sides, of, the, shield, are, known, as, the, dexter, and, sinister, flanks, although, these, terms, are, based, on, the, point, of, view, of, the, bearer, of, the, shield, who, would, be, standing, behind, it, to, the, observer, and, in, all, heraldic, illustration, the, dexter, is, on, the, left, side, and, the, sinister, on, the, right, the, placement, of, various, charges, may, also, refer, to, a, number, of, specific, points, nine, in, number, according, to, some, authorities, but, eleven, according, to, others, the, three, most, important, are, fess, point, located, in, the, visual, center, of, the, shield, the, honour, point, located, midway, between, fess, point, and, the, chief, and, the, nombril, point, located, midway, between, fess, point, and, the, base, the, other, points, include, dexter, chief, center, chief, and, sinister, chief, running, along, the, upper, part, of, the, shield, from, left, to, right, above, the, honour, point, dexter, flank, and, sinister, flank, on, the, sides, approximately, level, with, fess, point, and, dexter, base, middle, base, and, sinister, base, along, the, lower, part, of, the, shield, below, the, nombril, point, one, of, the, most, distinctive, qualities, of, heraldry, is, the, use, of, a, limited, palette, of, colours, and, patterns, usually, referred, to, as, tinctures, these, are, divided, into, three, categories, known, as, metals, colours, and, furs, the, metals, are, or, and, argent, representing, gold, and, silver, respectively, although, in, practice, they, are, usually, depicted, as, yellow, and, white, five, colours, are, universally, recognized, gules, or, red, sable, or, black, azure, or, blue, vert, or, green, and, purpure, or, purple, and, most, heraldic, authorities, also, admit, two, additional, colours, known, as, sanguine, or, murrey, a, dark, red, or, mulberry, colour, between, gules, and, purpure, and, tenn, an, orange, or, dark, yellow, to, brown, colour, these, last, two, are, quite, rare, and, are, often, referred, to, as, stains, from, the, belief, that, they, were, used, to, represent, some, dishonourable, act, although, in, fact, there, is, no, evidence, that, this, use, existed, outside, of, fanciful, heraldic, writers, perhaps, owing, to, the, realization, that, there, is, really, no, such, thing, as, a, stain, in, genuine, heraldry, as, well, as, the, desire, to, create, new, and, unique, designs, the, use, of, these, colours, for, general, purposes, has, become, accepted, in, the, twentieth, and, twenty, first, centuries, occasionally, one, meets, with, other, colours, particularly, in, continental, heraldry, although, they, are, not, generally, regarded, among, the, standard, heraldic, colours, among, these, are, cendr, e, or, ash, colour, brun, tre, or, brown, bleu, c, leste, or, bleu, de, ciel, sky, blue, amaranth, or, columbine, a, bright, violet, red, or, pink, colour, and, carnation, commonly, used, to, represent, flesh, in, french, heraldry, a, more, recent, addition, is, the, use, of, copper, as, a, metal, in, one, or, two, canadian, coats, of, arms, there, are, two, basic, types, of, heraldic, fur, known, as, ermine, and, vair, but, over, the, course, of, centuries, each, has, developed, a, number, of, variations, ermine, represents, the, fur, of, the, stoat, a, type, of, weasel, in, its, white, winter, coat, when, it, is, called, an, ermine, it, consists, of, a, white, or, occasionally, silver, field, powdered, with, black, figures, known, as, ermine, spots, representing, the, black, tip, of, the, animal, s, tail, ermine, was, traditionally, used, to, line, the, cloaks, and, caps, of, the, nobility, the, shape, of, the, heraldic, ermine, spot, has, varied, considerably, over, time, and, nowadays, is, typically, drawn, as, an, arrowhead, surmounted, by, three, small, dots, but, older, forms, may, be, employed, at, the, artist, s, discretion, when, the, field, is, sable, and, the, ermine, spots, argent, the, same, pattern, is, termed, ermines, when, the, field, is, or, rather, than, argent, the, fur, is, termed, erminois, and, when, the, field, is, sable, and, the, ermine, spots, or, it, is, termed, pean, vair, represents, the, winter, coat, of, the, red, squirrel, which, is, blue, grey, on, top, and, white, underneath, to, form, the, linings, of, cloaks, the, pelts, were, sewn, together, forming, an, undulating, bell, shaped, pattern, with, interlocking, light, and, dark, rows, the, heraldic, fur, is, depicted, with, interlocking, rows, of, argent, and, azure, although, the, shape, of, the, pelts, usually, referred, to, as, vair, bells, is, usually, left, to, the, artist, s, discretion, in, the, modern, form, the, bells, are, depicted, with, straight, lines, and, sharp, angles, and, meet, only, at, points, in, the, older, undulating, pattern, now, known, as, vair, ond, or, vair, ancien, the, bells, of, each, tincture, are, curved, and, joined, at, the, base, there, is, no, fixed, rule, as, to, whether, the, argent, bells, should, be, at, the, top, or, the, bottom, of, each, row, at, one, time, vair, commonly, came, in, three, sizes, and, this, distinction, is, sometimes, encountered, in, continental, heraldry, if, the, field, contains, fewer, than, four, rows, the, fur, is, termed, gros, vair, or, beffroi, if, of, six, or, more, it, is, menu, vair, or, miniver, a, common, variation, is, counter, vair, in, which, alternating, rows, are, reversed, so, that, the, bases, of, the, vair, bells, of, each, tincture, are, joined, to, those, of, the, same, tincture, in, the, row, above, or, below, when, the, rows, are, arranged, so, that, the, bells, of, each, tincture, form, vertical, columns, it, is, termed, vair, in, pale, in, continental, heraldry, one, may, encounter, vair, in, bend, which, is, similar, to, vair, in, pale, but, diagonal, when, alternating, rows, are, reversed, as, in, counter, vair, and, then, displaced, by, half, the, width, of, one, bell, it, is, termed, vair, in, point, or, wave, vair, a, form, peculiar, to, german, heraldry, is, alternate, vair, in, which, each, vair, bell, is, divided, in, half, vertically, with, half, argent, and, half, azure, all, of, these, variations, can, also, be, depicted, in, the, form, known, as, potent, in, which, the, shape, of, the, vair, bell, is, replaced, by, a, t, shaped, figure, known, as, a, potent, from, its, resemblance, to, a, crutch, although, it, is, really, just, a, variation, of, vair, it, is, frequently, treated, as, a, separate, fur, when, the, same, patterns, are, composed, of, tinctures, other, than, argent, and, azure, they, are, termed, vair, or, vairy, of, those, tinctures, rather, than, vair, potent, of, other, colours, may, also, be, found, usually, vair, will, consist, of, one, metal, and, one, colour, but, ermine, or, one, of, its, variations, may, also, be, used, and, vair, of, four, tinctures, usually, two, metals, and, two, colours, is, sometimes, found, three, additional, furs, are, sometimes, encountered, in, continental, heraldry, in, french, and, italian, heraldry, one, meets, with, plumet, or, plumetty, in, which, the, field, appears, to, be, covered, with, feathers, and, papelonn, in, which, it, is, decorated, with, scales, in, german, heraldry, one, may, encounter, kursch, or, vair, bellies, depicted, as, brown, and, furry, all, of, these, probably, originated, as, variations, of, vair, considerable, latitude, is, given, to, the, heraldic, artist, in, depicting, the, heraldic, tinctures, there, is, no, fixed, shade, or, hue, to, any, of, them, whenever, an, object, is, depicted, as, it, appears, in, nature, rather, than, in, one, or, more, of, the, heraldic, tinctures, it, is, termed, proper, or, the, colour, of, nature, this, does, not, seem, to, have, been, done, in, the, earliest, heraldry, but, examples, are, known, from, at, least, the, seventeenth, century, while, there, can, be, no, objection, to, the, occasional, depiction, of, objects, in, this, manner, the, overuse, of, charges, in, their, natural, colours, is, often, cited, as, indicative, of, bad, heraldic, practice, the, practice, of, landscape, heraldry, which, flourished, in, the, latter, part, of, the, eighteenth, and, early, part, of, the, nineteenth, century, made, extensive, use, of, non, heraldic, colours, one, of, the, most, important, conventions, of, heraldry, is, the, so, called, rule, of, tincture, to, provide, for, contrast, and, visibility, metals, should, never, be, placed, on, metals, and, colours, should, never, be, placed, on, colours, this, rule, does, not, apply, to, charges, which, cross, a, division, of, the, field, which, is, partly, metal, and, partly, colour, nor, strictly, speaking, does, it, prevent, a, field, from, consisting, of, two, metals, or, two, colours, although, this, is, unusual, furs, are, considered, amphibious, and, neither, metal, nor, colour, but, in, practice, ermine, and, erminois, are, usually, treated, as, metals, while, ermines, and, pean, are, treated, as, colours, this, rule, is, strictly, adhered, to, in, british, armory, with, only, rare, exceptions, although, generally, observed, in, continental, heraldry, it, is, not, adhered, to, quite, as, strictly, arms, which, violate, this, rule, are, sometimes, known, as, puzzle, arms, of, which, the, most, famous, example, is, the, arms, of, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, consisting, of, gold, crosses, on, a, silver, field, the, field, of, a, shield, or, less, often, a, charge, or, crest, is, sometimes, made, up, of, a, pattern, of, colours, or, variation, a, pattern, of, horizontal, barwise, stripes, for, example, is, called, barry, while, a, pattern, of, vertical, palewise, stripes, is, called, paly, a, pattern, of, diagonal, stripes, may, be, called, bendy, or, bendy, sinister, depending, on, the, direction, of, the, stripes, other, variations, include, chevrony, gyronny, and, chequy, wave, shaped, stripes, are, termed, undy, for, further, variations, these, are, sometimes, combined, to, produce, patterns, of, barry, bendy, paly, bendy, lozengy, and, fusilly, sem, s, or, patterns, of, repeated, charges, are, also, considered, variations, of, the, field, the, rule, of, tincture, applies, to, all, sem, s, and, variations, of, the, field, the, field, of, a, shield, in, heraldry, can, be, divided, into, more, than, one, tincture, as, can, the, various, heraldic, charges, many, coats, of, arms, consist, simply, of, a, division, of, the, field, into, two, contrasting, tinctures, these, are, considered, divisions, of, a, shield, so, the, rule, of, tincture, can, be, ignored, for, example, a, shield, divided, azure, and, gules, would, be, perfectly, acceptable, a, line, of, partition, may, be, straight, or, it, may, be, varied, the, variations, of, partition, lines, can, be, wavy, indented, embattled, engrailed, nebuly, or, made, into, myriad, other, forms, see, line, heraldry, in, the, early, days, of, heraldry, very, simple, bold, rectilinear, shapes, were, painted, on, shields, these, could, be, easily, recognized, at, a, long, distance, and, could, be, easily, remembered, they, therefore, served, the, main, purpose, of, heraldry, identification, as, more, complicated, shields, came, into, use, these, bold, shapes, were, set, apart, in, a, separate, class, as, the, honourable, ordinaries, they, act, as, charges, and, are, always, written, first, in, blazon, unless, otherwise, specified, they, extend, to, the, edges, of, the, field, though, ordinaries, are, not, easily, defined, they, are, generally, described, as, including, the, cross, the, fess, the, pale, the, bend, the, chevron, the, saltire, and, the, pall, there, is, a, separate, class, of, charges, called, sub, ordinaries, which, are, of, a, geometrical, shape, subordinate, to, the, ordinary, according, to, friar, they, are, distinguished, by, their, order, in, blazon, the, sub, ordinaries, include, the, inescutcheon, the, orle, the, tressure, the, double, tressure, the, bordure, the, chief, the, canton, the, label, and, flaunches, ordinaries, may, appear, in, parallel, series, in, which, case, blazons, in, english, give, them, different, names, such, as, pallets, bars, bendlets, and, chevronels, french, blazon, makes, no, such, distinction, between, these, diminutives, and, the, ordinaries, when, borne, singly, unless, otherwise, specified, an, ordinary, is, drawn, with, straight, lines, but, each, may, be, indented, embattled, wavy, engrailed, or, otherwise, have, their, lines, varied, a, charge, is, any, object, or, figure, placed, on, a, heraldic, shield, or, on, any, other, object, of, an, armorial, composition, any, object, found, in, nature, or, technology, may, appear, as, a, heraldic, charge, in, armory, charges, can, be, animals, objects, or, geometric, shapes, apart, from, the, ordinaries, the, most, frequent, charges, are, the, cross, with, its, hundreds, of, variations, and, the, lion, and, eagle, other, common, animals, are, bears, stags, wild, boars, martlets, wolves, and, fish, dragons, bats, unicorns, griffins, and, other, monsters, appear, as, charges, and, as, supporters, animals, are, found, in, various, stereotyped, positions, or, attitudes, quadrupeds, can, often, be, found, rampant, standing, on, the, left, hind, foot, another, frequent, position, is, passant, or, walking, like, the, lions, of, the, coat, of, arms, of, england, eagles, are, almost, always, shown, with, their, wings, spread, or, displayed, a, pair, of, wings, conjoined, is, called, a, vol, in, english, heraldry, the, crescent, mullet, martlet, annulet, fleur, de, lis, and, rose, may, be, added, to, a, shield, to, distinguish, cadet, branches, of, a, family, from, the, senior, line, these, cadency, marks, are, usually, shown, smaller, than, normal, charges, but, it, still, does, not, follow, that, a, shield, containing, such, a, charge, belongs, to, a, cadet, branch, all, of, these, charges, occur, frequently, in, basic, undifferenced, coats, of, arms, to, marshal, two, or, more, coats, of, arms, is, to, combine, them, in, one, shield, to, express, inheritance, claims, to, property, or, the, occupation, of, an, office, this, can, be, done, in, a, number, of, ways, of, which, the, simplest, is, impalement, dividing, the, field, per, pale, and, putting, one, whole, coat, in, each, half, impalement, replaced, the, earlier, dimidiation, combining, the, dexter, half, of, one, coat, with, the, sinister, half, of, another, because, dimidiation, can, create, ambiguity, between, for, example, a, bend, and, a, chevron, dexter, from, latin, dextra, right, means, to, the, right, from, the, viewpoint, of, the, bearer, of, the, arms, and, sinister, from, latin, sinistra, left, means, to, the, bearer, s, left, the, dexter, side, is, considered, the, side, of, greatest, honour, see, also, dexter, and, sinister, a, more, versatile, method, is, quartering, division, of, the, field, by, both, vertical, and, horizontal, lines, this, practice, originated, in, spain, castile, and, le, n, after, the, 13th, century, as, the, name, implies, the, usual, number, of, divisions, is, four, but, the, principle, has, been, extended, to, very, large, numbers, of, quarters, quarters, are, numbered, from, the, dexter, chief, the, corner, nearest, to, the, right, shoulder, of, a, man, standing, behind, the, shield, proceeding, across, the, top, row, and, then, across, the, next, row, and, so, on, when, three, coats, are, quartered, the, first, is, repeated, as, the, fourth, when, only, two, coats, are, quartered, the, second, is, also, repeated, as, the, third, the, quarters, of, a, personal, coat, of, arms, correspond, to, the, ancestors, from, whom, the, bearer, has, inherited, arms, normally, in, the, same, sequence, as, if, the, pedigree, were, laid, out, with, the, father, s, father, s, father, to, as, many, generations, as, necessary, on, the, extreme, left, and, the, mother, s, mother, s, mother, on, the, extreme, right, a, few, lineages, have, accumulated, hundreds, of, quarters, though, such, a, number, is, usually, displayed, only, in, documentary, contexts, the, scottish, and, spanish, traditions, resist, allowing, more, than, four, quarters, preferring, to, subdivide, one, or, more, grand, quarters, into, sub, quarters, as, needed, the, third, common, mode, of, marshalling, is, with, an, inescutcheon, a, small, shield, placed, in, front, of, the, main, shield, in, britain, this, is, most, often, an, escutcheon, of, pretence, indicating, in, the, arms, of, a, married, couple, that, the, wife, is, an, heraldic, heiress, i, e, she, inherits, a, coat, of, arms, because, she, has, no, brothers, in, continental, europe, an, inescutcheon, sometimes, called, a, heart, shield, usually, carries, the, ancestral, arms, of, a, monarch, or, noble, whose, domains, are, represented, by, the, quarters, of, the, main, shield, in, german, heraldry, animate, charges, in, combined, coats, usually, turn, to, face, the, centre, of, the, composition, in, english, the, word, crest, is, commonly, but, erroneously, used, to, refer, to, an, entire, heraldic, achievement, of, armorial, bearings, the, technical, use, of, the, heraldic, term, crest, refers, to, just, one, component, of, a, complete, achievement, the, crest, rests, on, top, of, a, helmet, which, itself, rests, on, the, most, important, part, of, the, achievement, the, shield, the, modern, crest, has, grown, out, of, the, three, dimensional, figure, placed, on, the, top, of, the, mounted, knights, helms, as, a, further, means, of, identification, in, most, heraldic, traditions, a, woman, does, not, display, a, crest, though, this, tradition, is, being, relaxed, in, some, heraldic, jurisdictions, and, the, stall, plate, of, lady, marion, fraser, in, the, thistle, chapel, in, st, giles, edinburgh, shows, her, coat, on, a, lozenge, but, with, helmet, crest, and, motto, the, crest, is, usually, found, on, a, wreath, of, twisted, cloth, and, sometimes, within, a, coronet, crest, coronets, are, generally, simpler, than, coronets, of, rank, but, several, specialized, forms, exist, for, example, in, canada, descendants, of, the, united, empire, loyalists, are, entitled, to, use, a, loyalist, military, coronet, for, descendants, of, members, of, loyalist, regiments, or, loyalist, civil, coronet, for, others, when, the, helm, and, crest, are, shown, they, are, usually, accompanied, by, a, mantling, this, was, originally, a, cloth, worn, over, the, back, of, the, helmet, as, partial, protection, against, heating, by, sunlight, today, it, takes, the, form, of, a, stylized, cloak, hanging, from, the, helmet, typically, in, british, heraldry, the, outer, surface, of, the, mantling, is, of, the, principal, colour, in, the, shield, and, the, inner, surface, is, of, the, principal, metal, though, peers, in, the, united, kingdom, use, standard, colourings, gules, doubled, argent, red, white, regardless, of, rank, or, the, colourings, of, their, arms, the, mantling, is, sometimes, conventionally, depicted, with, a, ragged, edge, as, if, damaged, in, combat, though, the, edges, of, most, are, simply, decorated, at, the, emblazoner, s, discretion, clergy, often, refrain, from, displaying, a, helm, or, crest, in, their, heraldic, achievements, members, of, the, clergy, may, display, appropriate, headwear, this, often, takes, the, form, of, a, small, crowned, wide, brimmed, hat, called, a, galero, with, the, colours, and, tassels, denoting, rank, or, in, the, case, of, papal, coats, of, arms, until, the, inauguration, of, pope, benedict, xvi, in, 2005, an, elaborate, triple, crown, known, as, a, tiara, benedict, broke, with, tradition, to, substitute, a, mitre, in, his, arms, orthodox, and, presbyterian, clergy, do, sometimes, adopt, other, forms, of, headgear, to, ensign, their, shields, in, the, anglican, tradition, clergy, members, may, pass, crests, on, to, their, offspring, but, rarely, display, them, on, their, own, shields, an, armorial, motto, is, a, phrase, or, collection, of, words, intended, to, describe, the, motivation, or, intention, of, the, armigerous, person, or, corporation, this, can, form, a, pun, on, the, family, name, as, in, thomas, nevile, s, motto, ne, vile, velis, mottoes, are, generally, changed, at, will, and, do, not, make, up, an, integral, part, of, the, armorial, achievement, mottoes, can, typically, be, found, on, a, scroll, under, the, shield, in, scottish, heraldry, where, the, motto, is, granted, as, part, of, the, blazon, it, is, usually, shown, on, a, scroll, above, the, crest, and, may, not, be, changed, at, will, a, motto, may, be, in, any, language, supporters, are, human, or, animal, figures, or, very, rarely, inanimate, objects, usually, placed, on, either, side, of, a, coat, of, arms, as, though, supporting, it, in, many, traditions, these, have, acquired, strict, guidelines, for, use, by, certain, social, classes, on, the, european, continent, there, are, often, fewer, restrictions, on, the, use, of, supporters, in, the, united, kingdom, only, peers, of, the, realm, a, few, baronets, senior, members, of, orders, of, knighthood, and, some, corporate, bodies, are, granted, supporters, often, these, can, have, local, significance, or, a, historical, link, to, the, armiger, if, the, armiger, has, the, title, of, baron, hereditary, knight, or, higher, he, may, display, a, coronet, of, rank, above, the, shield, in, the, united, kingdom, this, is, shown, between, the, shield, and, helmet, though, it, is, often, above, the, crest, in, continental, heraldry, another, addition, that, can, be, made, to, a, coat, of, arms, is, the, insignia, of, a, baronet, or, of, an, order, of, knighthood, this, is, usually, represented, by, a, collar, or, similar, band, surrounding, the, shield, when, the, arms, of, a, knight, and, his, wife, are, shown, in, one, achievement, the, insignia, of, knighthood, surround, the, husband, s, arms, only, and, the, wife, s, arms, are, customarily, surrounded, by, an, ornamental, garland, of, leaves, for, visual, balance, since, arms, pass, from, parents, to, offspring, and, there, is, frequently, more, than, one, child, per, couple, it, is, necessary, to, distinguish, the, arms, of, siblings, and, extended, family, members, from, the, original, arms, as, passed, on, from, eldest, son, to, eldest, son, over, time, several, schemes, have, been, used, to, blazon, arms, means, to, describe, them, using, the, formal, language, of, heraldry, this, language, has, its, own, vocabulary, and, syntax, or, rules, governing, word, order, which, becomes, essential, for, comprehension, when, blazoning, a, complex, coat, of, arms, the, verb, comes, from, the, middle, english, blasoun, itself, a, derivative, of, the, french, blason, meaning, shield, the, system, of, blazoning, arms, used, in, english, speaking, countries, today, was, developed, by, heraldic, officers, in, the, middle, ages, the, blazon, includes, a, description, of, the, arms, contained, within, the, escutcheon, or, shield, the, crest, supporters, where, present, motto, and, other, insignia, complex, rules, such, as, the, rule, of, tincture, apply, to, the, physical, and, artistic, form, of, newly, created, arms, and, a, thorough, understanding, of, these, rules, is, essential, to, the, art, of, heraldry, though, heraldic, forms, initially, were, broadly, similar, across, europe, several, national, styles, had, developed, by, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, and, artistic, and, blazoning, styles, today, range, from, the, very, simple, to, extraordinarily, complex, the, emergence, of, heraldry, occurred, across, western, europe, almost, simultaneously, in, the, various, countries, originally, heraldic, style, was, very, similar, from, country, to, country, over, time, heraldic, tradition, diverged, into, four, broad, styles, german, nordic, gallo, british, latin, and, eastern, in, addition, it, can, be, argued, that, newer, national, heraldic, traditions, such, as, south, african, and, canadian, heraldry, have, emerged, in, the, 20th, century, coats, of, arms, in, germany, the, nordic, countries, estonia, latvia, the, czech, lands, and, northern, switzerland, generally, change, very, little, over, time, marks, of, difference, are, very, rare, in, this, tradition, as, are, heraldic, furs, one, of, the, most, striking, characteristics, of, german, nordic, heraldry, is, the, treatment, of, the, crest, often, the, same, design, is, repeated, in, the, shield, and, the, crest, the, use, of, multiple, crests, is, also, common, the, crest, is, rarely, used, separately, as, in, british, heraldry, but, can, sometimes, serve, as, a, mark, of, difference, between, different, branches, of, a, family, torse, is, optional, heraldic, courtoisie, is, observed, that, is, charges, in, a, composite, shield, or, two, shields, displayed, together, usually, turn, to, face, the, centre, coats, consisting, only, of, a, divided, field, are, somewhat, more, frequent, in, germany, than, elsewhere, the, low, countries, were, great, centres, of, heraldry, in, medieval, times, one, of, the, famous, armorials, is, the, gelre, armorial, or, wapenboek, written, between, 1370, and, 1414, coats, of, arms, in, the, netherlands, were, not, controlled, by, an, official, heraldic, system, like, the, two, in, the, united, kingdom, nor, were, they, used, solely, by, noble, families, any, person, could, develop, and, use, a, coat, of, arms, if, they, wished, to, do, so, provided, they, did, not, usurp, someone, else, s, arms, and, historically, this, right, was, enshrined, in, roman, dutch, law, as, a, result, many, merchant, families, had, coats, of, arms, even, though, they, were, not, members, of, the, nobility, these, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, burgher, arms, and, it, is, thought, that, most, arms, of, this, type, were, adopted, while, the, netherlands, was, a, republic, 1581, 1806, this, heraldic, tradition, was, also, exported, to, the, erstwhile, dutch, colonies, dutch, heraldry, is, characterised, by, its, simple, and, rather, sober, style, and, in, this, sense, is, closer, to, its, medieval, origins, than, the, elaborate, styles, which, developed, in, other, heraldic, traditions, the, use, of, cadency, marks, to, difference, arms, within, the, same, family, and, the, use, of, semy, fields, are, distinctive, features, of, gallo, british, heraldry, in, scotland, the, most, significant, mark, of, cadency, being, the, bordure, the, small, brisures, playing, a, very, minor, role, marks, of, cadency, are, mandatory, in, scotland, where, no, two, persons, can, own, identical, arms, at, a, time, it, is, common, to, see, heraldic, furs, used, in, the, united, kingdom, the, style, is, notably, still, controlled, by, royal, officers, of, arms, french, heraldry, experienced, a, period, of, strict, rules, of, construction, under, napoleon, english, and, scots, heraldries, make, greater, use, of, supporters, than, other, european, countries, the, heraldry, of, southern, france, andorra, spain, and, italy, is, characterized, by, a, lack, of, crests, and, uniquely, shaped, shields, portuguese, heraldry, however, does, use, crests, portuguese, and, spanish, heraldry, which, together, form, a, larger, iberian, tradition, of, heraldry, occasionally, introduce, words, to, the, shield, of, arms, a, practice, usually, avoided, in, british, heraldry, latin, heraldry, is, known, for, extensive, use, of, quartering, because, of, armorial, inheritance, via, the, male, and, the, female, lines, moreover, italian, heraldry, is, dominated, by, the, roman, catholic, church, featuring, many, shields, and, achievements, most, bearing, some, reference, to, the, church, trees, are, frequent, charges, in, latin, arms, charged, bordures, including, bordures, inscribed, with, words, are, seen, often, in, spain, eastern, european, heraldry, is, in, the, traditions, developed, in, albania, belarus, bulgaria, croatia, hungary, lithuania, poland, romania, russia, serbia, slovakia, and, ukraine, eastern, coats, of, arms, are, characterized, by, a, pronounced, territorial, clan, system, often, entire, villages, or, military, groups, were, granted, the, same, coat, of, arms, irrespective, of, family, relationships, in, poland, nearly, six, hundred, unrelated, families, are, known, to, bear, the, same, jastrz, biec, coat, of, arms, marks, of, cadency, are, almost, unknown, and, shields, are, generally, very, simple, with, only, one, charge, many, heraldic, shields, derive, from, ancient, house, marks, at, least, fifteen, per, cent, of, all, hungarian, personal, arms, bear, a, severed, turk, s, head, referring, to, their, wars, against, the, ottoman, empire, true, heraldry, as, now, generally, understood, has, its, roots, in, medieval, europe, however, there, have, been, other, historical, cultures, which, have, used, symbols, and, emblems, to, represent, families, or, individuals, and, in, some, cases, these, symbols, have, been, adopted, into, western, heraldry, for, example, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, ottoman, empire, incorporated, the, royal, tughra, as, part, of, its, crest, along, with, such, traditional, western, heraldic, elements, as, the, escutcheon, and, the, compartment, ancient, greeks, were, among, the, first, civilizations, to, use, symbols, consistently, in, order, to, identify, a, warrior, clan, or, a, state, the, first, record, of, a, shield, blazon, is, illustrated, in, aeschylus, tragedy, seven, against, thebes, mon, also, monsh, mondokoro, and, kamon, are, japanese, emblems, used, to, decorate, and, identify, an, individual, or, family, while, mon, is, an, encompassing, term, that, may, refer, to, any, such, device, kamon, and, mondokoro, refer, specifically, to, emblems, used, to, identify, a, family, an, authoritative, mon, reference, compiles, japan, s, 241, general, categories, of, mon, based, on, structural, resemblance, a, single, mon, may, belong, to, multiple, categories, with, 5116, distinct, individual, mon, it, is, however, well, acknowledged, that, there, exist, lost, or, obscure, mon, that, are, not, in, this, compilation, the, devices, are, similar, to, the, badges, and, coats, of, arms, in, european, heraldic, tradition, which, likewise, are, used, to, identify, individuals, and, families, mon, are, often, referred, to, as, crests, in, western, literature, another, european, heraldic, device, similar, to, the, mon, in, function, japanese, helmets, kabuto, also, incorporated,
