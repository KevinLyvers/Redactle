the, julio, claudian, dynasty, comprised, the, first, five, roman, emperors, augustus, tiberius, caligula, claudius, and, nero, this, line, of, emperors, ruled, the, roman, empire, from, its, formation, under, augustus, in, 27, bc, until, the, last, of, the, line, emperor, nero, committed, suicide, in, ad, 68, the, name, julio, claudian, is, a, historiographical, term, deriving, from, the, two, families, composing, the, imperial, dynasty, the, julii, caesares, and, claudii, nerones, julius, and, claudius, were, two, roman, family, names, in, classical, latin, they, came, second, roman, family, names, were, inherited, from, father, to, son, but, a, roman, aristocrat, could, either, during, his, life, or, in, his, will, adopt, an, heir, if, he, lacked, a, natural, son, in, accordance, with, roman, naming, conventions, the, adopted, son, would, replace, his, original, family, name, with, the, name, of, his, adopted, family, a, famous, example, of, this, custom, is, julius, caesar, s, adoption, of, his, great, nephew, gaius, octavius, primogeniture, is, notably, absent, in, the, history, of, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, augustus, caligula, and, nero, failed, to, father, biological, and, legitimate, sons, tiberius, own, son, drusus, predeceased, him, only, claudius, was, outlived, by, his, son, britannicus, although, he, opted, to, promote, his, adopted, son, nero, as, his, successor, to, the, throne, adoption, ultimately, became, a, tool, that, most, julio, claudian, emperors, utilized, in, order, to, promote, their, chosen, heir, to, the, front, of, the, succession, augustus, himself, an, adopted, son, of, his, great, uncle, the, roman, dictator, julius, caesar, adopted, his, stepson, tiberius, as, his, son, and, heir, tiberius, was, in, turn, required, to, adopt, his, nephew, germanicus, the, father, of, caligula, and, brother, of, claudius, caligula, adopted, his, cousin, tiberius, gemellus, grandson, of, the, emperor, tiberius, shortly, before, executing, him, claudius, adopted, his, great, nephew, and, stepson, nero, who, lacking, a, natural, or, adopted, son, of, his, own, ended, the, reign, of, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, with, his, fall, from, power, and, subsequent, suicide, augustus, imperator, caesar, divi, filius, augustus, as, caesar, s, adopted, son, and, heir, discarded, the, family, name, of, his, natural, father, and, initially, renamed, himself, gaius, julius, caesar, after, his, adoptive, father, it, was, also, customary, for, the, adopted, son, to, acknowledge, his, original, family, by, adding, an, extra, name, at, the, end, of, his, new, name, as, such, augustus, adopted, name, would, have, been, gaius, julius, caesar, octavianus, however, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, ever, used, the, name, octavianus, following, augustus, ascension, as, the, first, emperor, of, the, roman, empire, in, 27, bc, his, family, became, a, de, facto, royal, house, known, in, historiography, as, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, for, various, reasons, the, julio, claudians, followed, in, the, example, of, julius, caesar, and, augustus, by, utilizing, adoption, as, a, tool, for, dynastic, succession, the, next, four, emperors, were, closely, related, through, a, combination, of, blood, relation, marriage, and, adoption, tiberius, tiberius, caesar, divi, augusti, filius, augustus, a, claudian, by, birth, became, augustus, stepson, after, the, latter, s, marriage, to, livia, who, divorced, tiberius, natural, father, in, the, process, tiberius, connection, to, the, julian, side, of, the, imperial, family, grew, closer, when, he, married, augustus, only, daughter, julia, the, elder, he, ultimately, succeeded, augustus, as, emperor, in, ad, 14, after, becoming, his, stepfather, s, adopted, son, and, heir, caligula, gaius, julius, caesar, augustus, germanicus, was, born, into, the, julian, and, claudian, branches, of, the, imperial, family, thereby, making, him, the, first, actual, julio, claudian, emperor, his, father, germanicus, was, the, son, of, nero, claudius, drusus, and, antonia, minor, the, son, of, livia, and, the, daughter, of, octavia, minor, respectively, germanicus, was, also, a, great, nephew, of, augustus, on, his, mother, s, side, and, nephew, of, tiberius, on, his, father, s, side, his, wife, agrippina, the, elder, was, a, granddaughter, of, augustus, through, agrippina, germanicus, children, including, caligula, were, augustus, great, grandchildren, when, augustus, adopted, tiberius, the, latter, was, required, to, adopt, his, brother, s, eldest, son, as, well, thus, allowing, germanicus, side, of, the, imperial, family, to, inherit, the, julius, nomen, claudius, tiberius, claudius, caesar, augustus, germanicus, the, younger, brother, of, germanicus, was, a, claudian, on, the, side, of, his, father, nero, claudius, drusus, younger, brother, of, tiberius, however, he, was, also, related, to, the, julian, branch, of, the, imperial, family, through, his, mother, antonia, minor, as, a, son, of, antonia, claudius, was, a, great, nephew, of, augustus, moreover, he, was, also, augustus, step, grandson, due, to, the, fact, that, his, father, was, a, stepson, of, augustus, unlike, tiberius, and, germanicus, both, of, whom, were, born, as, claudians, and, became, adopted, julians, claudius, was, not, adopted, into, the, julian, family, upon, becoming, emperor, however, he, added, the, julian, affiliated, cognomen, caesar, to, his, full, name, nero, nero, claudius, caesar, augustus, germanicus, was, a, great, great, grandson, of, augustus, and, livia, through, his, mother, agrippina, the, younger, the, younger, agrippina, was, a, daughter, of, germanicus, and, agrippina, the, elder, as, well, as, caligula, s, sister, through, his, mother, nero, was, related, by, blood, to, the, julian, and, claudian, branches, of, the, imperial, family, however, he, was, born, into, the, domitii, ahenobarbi, on, his, father, s, side, nero, became, a, claudian, in, name, as, a, result, of, agrippina, s, marriage, to, her, uncle, claudius, who, ultimately, adopted, her, son, as, his, own, he, succeeded, claudius, in, ad, 54, becoming, the, last, direct, descendant, of, augustus, to, rule, the, roman, empire, within, a, year, of, nero, s, suicide, in, ad, 68, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, was, succeeded, by, the, flavian, emperors, following, a, brief, civil, war, over, the, vacant, imperial, throne, lacking, any, male, child, and, heir, augustus, married, his, only, child, a, daughter, julia, to, his, nephew, marcus, claudius, marcellus, marcellus, however, died, of, food, poisoning, in, 23, bc, augustus, then, married, his, widowed, daughter, to, his, loyal, friend, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa,

agrippina, the, elder, and, agrippa, postumus, gaius, and, lucius, the, first, two, children, of, julia, and, agrippa, were, adopted, by, augustus, and, became, heirs, to, the, throne, however, augustus, also, showed, great, favour, toward, his, wife, livia, s, two, children, from, her, first, marriage, tiberius, and, drusus, they, were, successful, military, leaders, who, had, fought, against, the, barbarian, germanic, tribes, agrippa, died, in, 12, bc, and, tiberius, was, ordered, by, augustus, to, divorce, his, wife, vipsania, agrippina, daughter, of, agrippa, by, his, first, marriage, and, marry, his, stepsister, the, twice, widowed, julia, drusus, the, brother, of, tiberius, died, in, 9, bc, after, falling, from, a, horse, tiberius, shared, in, augustus, tribune, powers, but, shortly, thereafter, in, 6, bc, he, went, into, voluntary, exile, in, rhodes, after, the, early, deaths, of, both, lucius, ad, 2, and, gaius, ad, 4, and, the, exile, of, both, julia, the, elder, and, younger, for, adultery, a, turn, of, events, which, saw, the, elder, julia, s, half, brother, publius, cornelius, scipio, exiled, for, treason, mark, antony, s, son, iullus, antonius, committing, suicide, and, julia, the, younger, s, husband, lucius, aemilius, paullus, being, executed, for, conspiracy, augustus, was, forced, to, recognize, tiberius, as, the, next, roman, emperor, augustus,

tiberius, was, recalled, to, rome, and, officially, adopted, by, augustus, by, augustus, request, tiberius, adopted, his, nephew, germanicus, son, of, his, late, brother, drusus, and, biological, great, nephew, of, augustus, through, his, mother, germanicus, subsequently, married, augustus, granddaughter, agrippina, on, 19, august, ad, 14, augustus, died, tiberius, had, already, been, established, as, princeps, in, all, but, name, and, his, position, as, heir, was, confirmed, in, augustus, will, despite, his, difficult, relationship, with, the, senate, tiberius, first, years, were, generally, good, he, stayed, true, to, augustus, s, plans, for, the, succession, and, favoured, his, adopted, son, and, nephew, germanicus, over, his, natural, son, drusus, as, did, the, roman, populace, on, tiberius, request, germanicus, was, granted, proconsular, power, and, assumed, command, in, the, prime, military, zone, of, germania, where, he, suppressed, the, mutiny, there, and, led, the, formerly, restless, legions, on, campaigns, against, germanic, tribes, from, ad, 14, to, 16, germanicus, died, in, syria, in, ad, 19, and, on, his, deathbed, accused, the, governor, of, syria, gnaeus, calpurnius, piso, of, murdering, him, at, tiberius, s, orders, with, germanicus, dead, tiberius, began, elevating, his, own, son, drusus, to, replace, him, as, the, imperial, successor, by, this, time, tiberius, had, left, more, of, the, day, to, day, running, of, the, empire, to, lucius, aelius, sejanus, sejanus, created, an, atmosphere, of, fear, in, rome, controlling, a, network, of, informers, and, spies, whose, incentive, to, accuse, others, of, treason, was, a, share, in, the, accused, s, property, after, their, conviction, and, death, treason, trials, became, commonplace, few, members, of, the, roman, aristocracy, were, safe, the, trials, played, up, to, tiberius, growing, paranoia, which, made, him, more, reliant, on, sejanus, as, well, as, allowing, sejanus, to, eliminate, potential, rivals, victims, of, this, reign, of, terror, related, to, the, imperial, family, included, gaius, asinius, gallus, saloninus, second, husband, of, tiberius, first, wife, vipsania, who, had, since, died, and, decimus, haterius, agrippa, grandson, of, agrippa, and, husband, of, augustus, great, niece, tiberius, perhaps, sensitive, to, this, ambition, rejected, sejanus, s, initial, proposal, to, marry, livilla, germanicus, sister, and, the, widow, of, tiberius, son, drusus, the, younger, who, had, since, died, in, ad, 25, but, later, had, withdrawn, his, objections, so, that, in, ad, 30, sejanus, was, betrothed, to, julia, livia, daughter, of, livilla, and, drusus, the, younger, sejanus, family, connection, to, the, imperial, house, was, now, imminent, and, in, ad, 31, sejanus, held, the, consulship, with, the, emperor, as, his, colleague, an, honour, tiberius, reserved, only, for, heirs, to, the, throne, when, he, was, summoned, to, a, meeting, of, the, senate, later, that, year, on, 18, october, ad, 31, he, probably, expected, to, receive, a, share, of, the, tribunician, power, instead, however, tiberius, letter, to, the, senate, completely, unexpectedly, requested, the, destruction, of, sejanus, and, his, faction, a, purge, followed, in, which, sejanus, and, his, most, prominent, supporters, were, killed, with, drusus, dead, and, having, had, germanicus, elder, two, sons, nero, and, drusus, convicted, of, treason, and, killed, along, with, their, mother, agrippina, tiberius, appointed, caligula, germanicus, youngest, son, and, tiberius, gemellus, the, son, of, drusus, the, younger, and, grandson, of, tiberius, co, heirs, drusus, iii, s, wife, aemilia, lepida, was, later, forced, to, commit, suicide, after, being, accused, of, adultery, rome, s, second, emperor, died, at, the, port, town, of, misenum, on, 16, march, ad, 37, at, the, age, of, 78, years, having, reigned, for, 23, years, suetonius, writes, that, the, prefect, of, the, praetorian, guard, naevius, sutorius, macro, smothered, tiberius, with, a, pillow, to, hasten, caligula, s, accession, according, to, suetonius, he, was, known, for, his, cruelty, and, debauchery, through, his, perversion, on, the, island, of, capri, where, he, forced, young, boys, and, girls, into, orgies, on, one, account, when, one, of, the, boys, complained, tiberius, had, his, legs, broken, although, augustus, succession, plans, were, all, but, ruined, due, to, the, deaths, of, more, than, several, family, members, including, many, of, his, own, descendants, in, the, end, tiberius, remained, faithful, to, his, predecessor, s, wishes, that, the, next, emperor, would, hail, from, the, julian, side, of, the, imperial, family, thus, tiberius, was, succeeded, by, gaius, julius, caesar, augustus, germanicus, the, sole, remaining, son, of, his, nephew, and, adopted, son, germanicus, the, new, emperor, was, a, great, grandson, of, augustus, through, his, mother, agrippina, the, elder, thus, making, him, a, julian, but, he, was, also, a, claudian, through, his, father, germanicus, being, the, son, of, livia, s, younger, son, drusus, the, elder, more, commonly, remembered, in, history, by, his, childhood, nickname, caligula, he, was, the, third, roman, emperor, ruling, from, ad, 37, to, 41, when, tiberius, died, on, 16, march, ad, 37, caligula, was, well, positioned, to, assume, power, despite, the, obstacle, of, tiberius, s, will, which, named, him, and, his, cousin, tiberius, gemellus, as, joint, heirs, caligula, ordered, gemellus, killed, within, his, first, year, in, power, backed, by, naevius, sutorius, macro, caligula, asserted, himself, as, sole, princeps, though, he, later, had, macro, disposed, of, as, well, following, gemellus, death, caligula, marked, his, brother, in, law, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, husband, of, his, sister, julia, drusilla, as, his, heir, however, after, drusilla, s, death, lepidus, was, accused, of, having, affairs, with, caligula, s, other, sisters, agrippina, the, younger, and, julia, livilla, and, he, was, executed, he, had, previously, had, drusilla, s, first, husband, lucius, cassius, longinus, killed, and, upon, the, death, of, agrippina, s, husband, gnaeus, domitius, ahenobarbus, he, seized, his, inheritance, several, unsuccessful, assassination, attempts, were, made, on, caligula, s, life, the, successful, conspiracy, that, ended, caligula, s, life, was, hatched, by, the, disgruntled, praetorian, guard, with, backing, by, the, senate, the, historian, josephus, claims, that, the, conspirators, wished, to, restore, the, republic, while, the, historian, suetonius, claims, their, motivations, were, mostly, personal, on, 24, january, ad, 41, the, praetorian, tribune, cassius, chaerea, and, his, men, stopped, caligula, alone, in, an, underground, passage, leading, to, a, theater, they, stabbed, him, to, death, together, with, another, tribune, cornelius, sabinus, he, killed, caligula, s, wife, caesonia, and, their, infant, daughter, julia, drusilla, on, the, same, day, after, caligula, s, death, the, senate, attempted, and, failed, to, restore, the, republic, claudius, caligula, s, paternal, uncle, became, emperor, by, the, instigation, of, the, praetorian, guards, despite, his, lack, of, political, experience, and, the, disapproval, of, the, people, of, rome, claudius, proved, to, be, an, able, administrator, and, a, great, builder, of, public, works, his, reign, saw, an, expansion, of, the, empire, including, the, invasion, of, britain, in, ad, 43, he, took, a, personal, interest, in, the, law, presided, at, public, trials, and, issued, up, to, twenty, edicts, a, day, however, he, was, seen, as, vulnerable, throughout, his, rule, particularly, by, the, nobility, claudius, was, constantly, forced, to, shore, up, his, position, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, many, senators, claudius, also, suffered, tragic, setbacks, in, his, personal, life, he, married, four, times, to, in, order, plautia, urgulanilla, aelia, paetina, valeria, messalina, and, finally, agrippina, the, younger, and, is, referenced, by, suetonius, as, being, easily, manipulated, this, is, particularly, evident, during, his, marriage, to, agrippina, the, younger, his, niece, messalina, saw, several, members, of, the, dynasty, eliminated, notably, arranging, for, the, executions, of, claudius, nieces, julia, livilla, daughter, of, germanicus, and, agrippina, the, elder, and, julia, livia, daughter, of, livilla, and, drusus, the, younger, as, well, as, julia,

married, agrippina, and, adopted, his, great, nephew, nero, with, his, adoption, on, 25, february, ad, 50, nero, became, heir, to, the, throne, over, claudius, own, son, britannicus, claudius, died, on, 13, october, ad, 54, and, nero, became, emperor, a, number, of, ancient, historians, accuse, agrippina, of, poisoning, claudius, but, details, on, these, private, events, vary, widely, these, events, are, recounted, in, book, 12, of, the, annals, of, tacitus, book, 61, of, cassius, dio, s, roman, history, and, in, the, biographies, of, nero, and, claudius, by, suetonius, nero, became, emperor, in, ad, 54, at, sixteen, the, youngest, emperor, yet, like, his, maternal, uncle, caligula, before, him, nero, was, also, a, direct, descendant, of, augustus, a, fact, which, made, his, ascension, to, the, throne, much, easier, and, smoother, than, it, had, been, for, tiberius, or, claudius, ancient, historians, describe, nero, s, early, reign, as, being, strongly, influenced, by, his, mother, agrippina, the, younger, his, tutor, seneca, and, the, praetorian, prefect, burrus, especially, in, the, first, year, in, the, first, year, of, his, reign, nero, had, left, all, of, the,
