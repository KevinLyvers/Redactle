to, the, throne, was, the, influence, of, siam, in, cambodia, again, contested, relations, with, vietnam, took, on, a, prominent, place, in, this, epoch, as, there, was, yet, to, be, significant, relations, with, the, european, colonial, powers, during, the, reign, of, rama, i, one, of, the, most, important, achievements, of, rama, i, was, the, codification, of, all, the, country, s, laws, into, a, work, of, 1, 700, pages, called, the, three, seals, law, this, law, remained, valid, in, its, basic, traits, until, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, siam, also, had, a, high,

was, more, centralized, than, its, predecessors, a, particularly, important, innovation, was, the, stronger, emphasis, on, rationality, in, the, relationship, between, the, monarch, and, his, subjects, rama, i, was, the, first, king, in, the, history, of, the, country, who, justified, his, decisions, before, the, highest, officials, king, rama, ii, phra, phutthaloetla, was, the, son, of, rama, i, his, accession, to, the, throne, was, accompanied, by, a, plot, during, which, 40, people, were, killed, the, calmness, of, the, interior, and, the, exterior, which, during, the, reign, of, rama, ii, and, his, successor, rama, iii, phra, nangklao, prevailed, mainly, through, giving, in, to, conflicts, and, building, good, relations, with, influential, clans, in, the, country, during,

employed, by, rama, ii, included, sunthorn, phu, the, drunken, writer, phra, aphai, mani, and, narin, dhibet, nirat, narin, foreign, relations, were, initially, dominated, by, relations, with, the, neighbouring, states, while, those, with, european, colonial, powers, started, to, enter, in, the, background, in, cambodia, and, laos, vietnam, gained, the, supremacy, a, fact, which, rama, ii, initially, accepted, when, a, rebellion, broke, out, in, vietnam, under, rama, iii, in, 1833, 34, he, tried, to, subdue, the, vietnamese, militarily, but, this, led, to, a, costly, defeat, for, the, siamese, troops, in, the, 1840s, however, the, khmer, themselves, succeeded, in, expelling, the, vietnamese, which, subsequently, led, to, the, greater, influence, of, siam, in, cambodia, at, the, same, time, siam, kept, sending, tribute, to, china, there, was, a, serious, touch, with, british, colonial, interests, when, siam, conquered, the, sultanate, kedah, on, the, malay, peninsula, in, 1821, kedah, belonged, to, the, sphere, of, interest, of, great, britain, in, the, following, year, siam, had, to, recognise, the, pre, conquest, status, after, tough, negotiations, with, the, british, envoy, john, crawfurd, there, was, also, the, cautious, resumption, of, trade, and, missionary, activity, in, this, epoch, in, particular, british, traders, such, as, robert, hunter, discoverer, of, the, conjoined, brothers, chang, and, eng, the, original, siamese, twins, or, james, hayes, but, also, missionaries, from, europe, and, the, united, states, like, jacob, tomlin, karl, g, tzlaff, dan, beach, bradley, and, jean, baptiste, pallegoix, became, active, in, siam, in, 1825, an, agreement, was, signed, with, british, emissary, henry, burney, siam, recognised, british, colonial, possessions, on, the, malay, peninsula, and, made, commercial, concessions, this, agreement, was, due, not, least, to, the, rapid, british, success, in, the, first, anglo, burmese, war, a, potentially, dangerous, event, occurred, with, the, anouvong, s, rebellion, in, 1827, when, the, troops, of, the, tributary, king, anouvong, of, the, kingdom, of, vientiane, advanced, towards, bangkok, they, were, however, destroyed, which, strengthened, the, position, of, siam, in, laos, the, lao, population, of, the, areas, west, of, the, mekong, were, relocated, to, thai, provinces, in, isan, under, rama, ii, and, rama, iii, culture, dance, poetry, and, above, all, the, theatre, reached, a, climax, the, temple, wat, pho, was, built, by, rama, iii, known, as, the, first, university, of, the, country, the, reign, of, rama, iii, was, finally, marked, by, a, division, of, the, aristocracy, with, regard, to, foreign, policy, a, small, group, of, advocates, of, the, takeover, of, western, technologies, and, other, achievements, were, opposed, by, conservative, circles, which, proposed, a, stronger, isolation, instead, since, the, kings, rama, ii, and, rama, iii, the, conservative, religious, circles, largely, stuck, with, their, isolationist, tendency, the, death, of, rama, iii, in, 1851, also, signified, the, end, of, the, old, traditional, siamese, monarchy, there, were, already, clear, signs, of, profound, changes, which, were, implemented, by, the, two, successors, of, the, king, when, king, mongkut, rama, iv, ascended, the, siamese, throne, he, was, severely, threatened, by, the, neighbouring, states, the, colonial, powers, of, britain, and, france, had, already, advanced, into, territories, which, originally, belonged, to, the, siamese, sphere, of, influence, mongkut, and, his, successor, chulalongkorn, rama, v, recognised, this, situation, and, tried, to, strengthen, the, defence, forces, of, siam, by, modernisation, to, absorb, western, scientific, and, technical, achievements, thus, avoiding, colonisation, the, two, monarchs, who, ruled, in, this, epoch, were, the, first, with, western, formation, king, mongkut, had, lived, 26, years, as, a, wandering, monk, and, later, as, an, abbot, of, wat, bowonniwet, vihara, he, was, not, only, skilled, in, the, traditional, culture, and, buddhist, sciences, of, siam, but, he, had, also, dealt, extensively, with, modern, western, science, drawing, on, the, knowledge, of, european, missionaries, and, his, correspondence, with, western, leaders, and, the, pope, he, was, the, first, siamese, monarch, to, speak, english, the, colonial, encroachment, in, the, 1880s, in, burma, to, the, west, by, the, british, empire, and, indochina, to, the, east, by, the, french, caused, anxiety, amongst, the, siamese, elites, including, the, british, educated, prince, prisdang, who, put, forward, a, proposal, alongside, eleven, other, senior, dignitaries, to, king, chulalongkorn, to, strengthen, siamese, institutions, following, the, european, model, some, of, these, reforms, reflect, need, to, keep, up, with, european, convention, of, liberal, statecraft, and, justice, to, maintain, legitimacy, prisdang, suggested, that, the, following, reforms, should, be, carried, out, the, majority, of, these, reforms, were, implemented, decades, after, chulalongkorn, s, death, as, early, as, 1855, john, bowring, the, british, governor, in, hong, kong, appeared, on, a, warship, at, the, mouth, of, the, chao, phraya, river, under, the, influence, of, britain, s, achievements, in, neighbouring, burma, king, mongkut, signed, the, so, called, bowring, treaty, which, abolished, the, royal, foreign, trade, monopoly, abolished, import, duties, and, granted, britain, a, most, favourable, clause, the, bowring, treaty, meant, the, integration, of, siam, into, the, world, economy, but, at, the, same, time, the, royal, house, lost, its, most, important, sources, of, income, similar, treaties, were, concluded, with, all, western, powers, in, the, following, years, such, as, in, 1862, with, prussia, and, 1869, with, austria, hungary, from, the, prussian, emissary, count, friedrich, albrecht, zu, eulenburg, comes, a, much, respected, travel, report, about, siam, the, survival, diplomacy, which, siam, had, cultivated, abroad, for, a, long, time, reached, its, climax, in, this, epoch, the, integration, into, the, global, economy, meant, to, siam, that, it, became, a, sales, market, for, western, industrial, goods, and, an, investment, for, western, capital, the, export, of, agricultural, and, mineral, raw, materials, began, including, the, three, products, rice, pewter, and, teakwood, which, were, used, to, produce, 90, of, the, export, turnover, king, mongkut, actively, promoted, the, expansion, of, agricultural, land, by, tax, incentives, while, the, construction, of, traffic, routes, canals, roads, and, later, also, railways, and, the, influx, of, chinese, immigrants, allowed, the, agricultural, development, of, new, regions, subsistence, farming, in, the, lower, menam, valley, developed, into, farmers, actually, earning, money, with, their, produce, mongkut, s, son, king, chulalongkorn, rama, v, ascended, to, the, throne, in, 1868, he, was, the, first, siamese, king, to, have, a, full, western, education, having, been, taught, by, a, british, governess, anna, leonowens, whose, place, in, siamese, history, has, been, fictionalised, as, the, king, and, i, at, first, rama, v, s, reign, was, dominated, by, the, conservative, regent, somdet, chaophraya, sri, suriwongse, but, when, the, king, came, of, age, in, 1873, he, soon, took, control, he, created, a, privy, council, and, a, council, of, state, a, formal, court, system, and, budget, office, he, announced, that, slavery, would, be, gradually, abolished, and, debt, bondage, restricted, two, kings, mongkut, and, chulalongkorn, witnessed, the, expansion, of,

the, east, the, french, conquered, south, vietnam, vietnam, and, claimed, to, be, protecting, cambodia, while, siam, lost, its, extraterritorial, rights, in, these, areas, to, the, new, conquerors, the, construction, of, kra, isthmus, canal, planned, by, a, group, of, entrepreneurs, led, by, the, engineer, ferdinand, de, lesseps, was, not, constructed, after, the, british, conquered, kongbaung, ruled, burma, in, the, third, anglo, burmese, war, in, 1885, a, major, event, was, the, paknam, incident, when, on, 13, july, 1893, french, cannon, boats, entered, the, chao, phraya, river, toward, bangkok, and, were, fired, upon, from, a, siamese, coastal, fort, leading, to, the, franco, siamese, crisis, in, the, same, year, siam, was, compelled, to, conclude, a, treaty, with, france, in, which, the, territory, of, laos, located, east, of, the, mekong, was, annexed, to, french, indochina, the, french, forced, siam, to, refrain, from, any, influence, on, its, former, vassal, state, in,

the, french, crisis, of, 1893, king, chulalongkorn, realised, the, threat, of, the, western, colonial, powers, and, accelerated, extensive, reforms, in, the, administration, military, economy, and, society, of, siam, completing, the, development, of, the, nation, from, a, traditional, feudalist, structure, based, on, personal, domination, and, dependencies, whose, peripheral, areas, were, only, indirectly, bound, to, the, central, power, the, king, to, a, centrally, governed, national, state, with, established, borders, and, modern, political, institutions, the, entente, cordiale, of, 8, april, 1904, ended, the, rivalry, between, great, britain, and, france, over, siam, french, and, british, zones, of, influence, in, siam, were, outlined, with, the, eastern, territories, adjacent, to,

when, king, chulalongkorn, died, in, 1910, siam, had, achieved, the, borders, of, today, s, thailand, in, 1910, he, was, peacefully, succeeded, by, his, son, vajiravudh, who, reigned, as, rama, vi, he, had, been, educated, at, royal, military, academy, sandhurst, and, university, of, oxford, and, was, an, anglicised, edwardian, gentleman, indeed, one, of, siam, s, problems, was, the, widening, gap, between, the, westernised, royal, family, and, upper, aristocracy, and, the, rest, of, the, country, it, took, another, 20, years, for, western, education, to, extend, to, the, rest, of, the, bureaucracy, and, the, army, the, successor, of, king, chulalongkorn, was, king, rama, vi, in, october, 1910, better, known, as, vajiravudh, he, had, studied, law, and, history, at, the, university, of, oxford, as, the, siamese, crown, prince, in, great, britain, after, his, ascension, to, the, throne, he, forgave, important, officials, for, his, devoted, friends, who, were, not, part, of, the, nobility, and, even, less, qualified, than, their, predecessors, an, action, which, had, hitherto, been, unprecedented, in, siam, in, his, reign, 1910, 1925, many, changes, were, made, which, brought, siam, closer, to, modern, countries, for, example, the, gregorian, calendar, was, introduced, all, the, citizens, of, his, country, had, to, accept, family, names, women, were, encouraged, to, wear, skirts, and, long, hair, fringements, and, a, citizenship, law, principle, of, the, ius, sanguinis, was, adopted, in, 1917, the, chulalongkorn, university, was, founded, and, school, education, was, introduced, for, all, 7, to, 14, year, olds, king, vajiravudh, was, a, favour, of, literature, theatre, he, translated, many, foreign, literatures, into, thai, he, created, the, spiritual, foundation, for, a, kind, of, thai, nationalism, a, phenomenon, unknown, in, siam, he, was, based, on, the, unity, of, nation, buddhism, and, kingship, and, demanded, loyalty, from, his, subjects, to, all, these, three, institutions, king, vajiravudh, also, took, refuge, in, an, irrational, and, contradictory, anti, sinicism, as, a, result, of, the, mass, immigration, in, contrast, to, previous, immigration, waves, from, china, women, and, entire, families, had, also, come, into, the, country, which, meant, that, the, chinese, were, less, assimilated, and, retained, their, cultural, independence, in, an, article, published, by, king, vajiravudh, under, a, pseudonym, he, described, the, chinese, minority, as, jews, of, the, east, king, vajiravudh, also, created, some, new, social, associations, for, example, the, wild, tiger, corps, 1911, a, kind, of, scout, movement, in, 1912, a, palace, revolt, plotted, by, young, military, officers, tried, unsuccessfully, to, overthrow, and, replace, the, king, their, goals, were, to, change, the, system, of, government, overthrowing, the, ancien, r, gime, and, replacing, it, with, a, modern, westernised, constitutional, system, and, perhaps, to, replace, rama, vi, with, a, prince, more, sympathetic, to, their, beliefs, 155, but, the, king, went, against, the, conspirators, and, sentenced, many, of, them, to, long, prison, sentences, the, members, of, the, conspiracy, consisted, of, military, and, the, navy, the, status, of, the, monarchy, had, become, challenged, in, 1917, siam, declared, war, on, german, empire, and, austria, hungary, mainly, to, gain, favour, with, the, british, and, the, french, siam, s, token, participation, in, world, war, i, secured, it, a, seat, at, the, versailles, peace, conference, and, foreign, minister, devawongse, used, this, opportunity, to, argue, for, the, repeal, of, the, 19th, century, unequal, treaties, and, the, restoration, of, full, siamese, sovereignty, the, united, states, obliged, in, 1920, while, france, and, britain, followed, in, 1925, this, victory, gained, the, king, some, popularity, but, it, was, soon, undercut, by, discontent, over, other, issues, such, as, his, extravagance, which, became, more, noticeable, when, a, sharp, postwar, recession, hit, siam, in, 1919, there, was, also, the, fact, that, the, king, had, no, son, he, obviously, preferred, the, company, of, men, to, women, a, matter, which, of, itself, did, not, much, concern, siamese, opinion, but, which, did, undermine, the, stability, of, the, monarchy, due, to, the, absence, of, heirs, thus, when, rama, vi, died, suddenly, in, 1925, aged, only, 44, the, monarchy, was, already, in, a, weakened, state, he, was, succeeded, by, his, younger, brother, prajadhipok, by, 1925, 1926, siamese, extraterritorial, rights, were, restored, a, period, of, five, years, thereafter, a, small, circle, from, the, rising, bourgeoisie, of, former, students, all, of, whom, had, completed, their, studies, in, europe, mostly, paris, supported, by, some, military, men, seized, power, from, the, absolute, monarchy, on, 24, june, 1932, in, an, almost, nonviolent, revolution, this, was, also, called, the, siamese, revolution, the, group, which, called, themselves, khana, ratsadon, or, sponsors, gathered, officers, intellectuals, and, bureaucrats, who, represented, the, idea, of, the, refusal, of, the, absolute, monarchy, the, khana, ratsadon, installed, a, constitutional, monarchy, with, prajadhipok, as, king, at, the, top, a, corresponding, constitution, was, proclaimed, on, 10, december, of, the, year, on, the, same, day, the, experienced, and, rather, conservative, lawyer, phraya, manopakorn, nititada, was, appointed, as, first, siamese, prime, minister, by, selecting, a, non, party, head, of, government, the, khana, ratsadon, wanted, to, avoid, the, suspicion, that, the, coup, had, only, been, carried, out, in, order, to, come, to, power, itself, however, the, overthrow, of, the, monarchy, did, not, lead, to, free, elections, and, political, unions, were, forbidden, bureaucracy, and, the, military, shared, the, power, in, the, national, assembly, the, constitution, was, annexed, to, the, monarchist, ideology, nation, religion, king, as, a, fourth, pillar, in, the, following, period, it, became, clear, how, heterogeneous, the, group, of, khana, ratsadon, was, and, it, fell, into, several, rival, wings, especially, those, of, the, high, officers, the, younger, officers, and, the, civilians, from, the, liberal, and, civilian, wing, pridi, phanomyong, sought, a, profound, transformation, of, the, country, s, social, and, economic, system, to, this, end, he, presented, an, economic, plan, in, january, 1933, which, became, known, as, a, yellow, cover, dossier, thai, among, other, things, he, proposed, the, nationalisation, of, farmland, industrialization, through, public, companies, universal, healthcare, and, pension, insurance, the, king, the, rather, conservative, prime, minister, phraya, manopakorn, and, the, high, ranking, officers, in, the, khana, ratsadon, around, phraya, songsuradet, and, even, pridi, s, friend, and, co, worker, prayun, phamonmontri, opposed, the, plan, fearing, that, pridi, s, liberal, wing, who, had, the, majority, in, the, national, assembly, would, decide, to, take, action, phraya, manopakorn, dissolved, the, parliament, in, april, imposed, an, emergency, and, rescinded, the, constitution, which, had, not, yet, been, a, year, old, he, imposed, a, law, against, communist, activities, which, was, directed, not, so, much, against, the, almost, insignificant, communist, party, of, thailand, but, rather, against, the, alleged, communist, projects, of, pridi, however, the, younger, officers, of, the, khana, ratsadon, resisted, and, countered, the, actions, of, phraya, manopakorn, in, another, coup, d, tat, only, one, year, later, in, june, 1933, resulting, in, the, appointment, of, phraya, phahon, as, siam, s, second, prime, minister, after, the, fall, of, phraya, manopakorn, phraya, phahon, became, the, new, prime, minister, pridi, phanomyong, was, expelled, from, the, charge, of, communism, but, his, economic, plan, was, largely, ignored, only, a, few, of, his, ideas, such, as, the, expansion, of, primary, schools, and, industrialisation, with, state, enterprises, were, gradually, implemented, in, 1933, pridis, founded, the, thammasat, university, in, bangkok, which, with, its, liberal, self, image, has, remained, a, symbol, of, freedom, and, democracy, at, the, same, time, the, nationalist, group, led, by, phibunsongkhram, strengthened, in, the, people, s, party, oriented, to, the, totalitarian, ideas, of, italy, germany, japan, but, also, the, young, turks, kemal, atat, rk, the, many, unsettled, constitutional, roles, of, the, crown, and, the, dissatisfaction, with, khana, ratsadon, especially, pridi, s, post, in, the, new, government, culminated, in,
