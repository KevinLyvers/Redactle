the, city, of, athens, ancient, greek, ath, nai, modern, greek, athine, or, more, commonly, and, in, singular, athina, during, the, classical, period, of, ancient, greece, 480, 323, bc, was, the, major, urban, centre, of, the, notable, polis, city, state, of, the, same, name, located, in, attica, greece, leading, the, delian, league, in, the, peloponnesian, war, against, sparta, and, the, peloponnesian, league, athenian, democracy, was, established, in, 508, bc, under, cleisthenes, following, the, tyranny, of, isagoras, this, system, remained, remarkably, stable, and, with, a, few, brief, interruptions, it, remained, in, place, for, 180, years, until, 322, bc, aftermath, of, lamian, war, the, peak, of, athenian, hegemony, was, achieved, in, the, 440s, to, 430s, bc, known, as, the, age, of, pericles, in, the, classical, period, athens, was, a, centre, for, the, arts, learning, and, philosophy, the, home, of, plato, s, academy, and, aristotle, s, lyceum, athens, was, also, the, birthplace, of, socrates, plato, pericles, aristophanes, sophocles, and, many, other, prominent, philosophers, writers, and, politicians, of, the, ancient, world, it, is, widely, referred, to, as, the, cradle, of, western, civilization, and, the, birthplace, of, democracy, largely, due, to, the, impact, of, its, cultural, and, political, achievements, during, the, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, on, the, rest, of, the, then, known, european, continent, hippias, son, of, peisistratus, had, ruled, athens, jointly, with, his, brother, hipparchus, from, the, death, of, peisistratus, in, about, 527, following, the, assassination, of, hipparchus, in, about, 514, hippias, took, on, sole, rule, and, in, response, to, the, loss, of, his, brother, became, a, worse, leader, who, was, increasingly, disliked, hippias, exiled, 700, of, the, athenian, noble, families, amongst, them, cleisthenes, family, the, alchmaeonids, upon, their, exile, they, went, to, delphi, and, herodotus, says, they, bribed, the, pythia, always, to, tell, visiting, spartans, that, they, should, invade, attica, and, overthrow, hippias, that, supposedly, worked, after, a, number, of, times, and, cleomenes, i, led, a, spartan, force, to, overthrow, hippias, which, succeeded, and, instated, an, oligarchy, cleisthenes, disliked, the, spartan, rule, along, with, many, other, athenians, and, so, made, his, own, bid, for, power, the, result, was, democracy, in, athens, but, considering, cleisthenes, motivation, for, using, the, people, to, gain, power, as, without, their, support, he, would, have, been, defeated, and, so, athenian, democracy, may, be, tainted, by, the, fact, its, creation, served, greatly, the, man, who, created, it, the, reforms, of, cleisthenes, replaced, the, traditional, four, ionic, tribes, phyle, with, ten, new, ones, named, after, legendary, heroes, of, greece, and, having, no, class, basis, which, acted, as, electorates, each, tribe, was, in, turn, divided, into, three, trittyes, one, from, the, coast, one, from, the, city, and, one, from, the, inland, divisions, while, each, trittys, had, one, or, more, demes, depending, on, their, population, which, became, the, basis, of, local, government, the, tribes, each, selected, fifty, members, by, lot, for, the, boule, the, council, that, governed, athens, on, a, day, to, day, basis, the, public, opinion, of, voters, could, be, influenced, by, the, political, satires, written, by, the, comic, poets, and, performed, in, the, city, theaters, the, assembly, or, ecclesia, was, open, to, all, full, citizens, and, was, both, a, legislature, and, a, supreme, court, except, in, murder, cases, and, religious, matters, which, became, the, only, remaining, functions, of, the, areopagus, most, offices, were, filled, by, lot, although, the, ten, strategoi, generals, were, elected, the, silver, mines, of, laurion, contributed, significantly, to, the, development, of, athens, in, the, 5th, century, bc, when, the, athenians, learned, to, prospect, treat, and, refine, the, ore, and, used, the, proceeds, to, build, a, massive, fleet, at, the, instigation, of, themistocles, in, 499, bc, athens, sent, troops, to, aid, the, ionian, greeks, of, asia, minor, who, were, rebelling, against, the, persian, empire, see, ionian, revolt, that, provoked, two, persian, invasions, of, greece, both, of, which, were, repelled, under, the, leadership, of, the, soldier, statesmen, miltiades, and, themistocles, see, persian, wars, in, 490, the, athenians, led, by, miltiades, prevented, the, first, invasion, of, the, persians, guided, by, king, darius, i, at, the, battle, of, marathon, in, 480, the, persians, returned, under, a, new, ruler, xerxes, i, the, hellenic, league, led, by, the, spartan, king, leonidas, led, 7, 000, men, to, hold, the, narrow, passageway, of, thermopylae, against, the, 100, 000, 250, 000, army, of, xerxes, during, which, leonidas, and, 300, other, spartan, elites, were, killed, simultaneously, the, athenians, led, an, indecisive, naval, battle, off, artemisium, however, that, delaying, action, was, not, enough, to, discourage, the, persian, advance, which, soon, marched, through, boeotia, setting, up, thebes, as, their, base, of, operations, and, entered, southern, greece, that, forced, the, athenians, to, evacuate, athens, which, was, taken, by, the, persians, and, seek, the, protection, of, their, fleet, subsequently, the, athenians, and, their, allies, led, by, themistocles, defeated, the, persian, navy, at, sea, in, the, battle, of, salamis, xerxes, had, built, himself, a, throne, on, the, coast, in, order, to, see, the, greeks, defeated, instead, the, persians, were, routed, sparta, s, hegemony, was, passing, to, athens, and, it, was, athens, that, took, the, war, to, asia, minor, the, victories, enabled, it, to, bring, most, of, the, aegean, and, many, other, parts, of, greece, together, in, the, delian, league, an, athenian, dominated, alliance, pericles, an, athenian, general, politician, and, orator, distinguished, himself, above, the, other, personalities, of, the, era, men, who, excelled, in, politics, philosophy, architecture, sculpture, history, and, literature, he, fostered, arts, and, literature, and, gave, to, athens, a, splendor, which, would, never, return, throughout, its, history, he, executed, a, large, number, of, public, works, projects, and, improved, the, life, of, the, citizens, hence, this, period, is, often, referred, to, as, age, of, pericles, silver, mined, in, laurium, in, southeastern, attica, contributed, greatly, to, the, prosperity, of, this, athenian, golden, age, during, the, time, of, the, ascendancy, of, ephialtes, as, leader, of, the, democratic, faction, pericles, was, his, deputy, when, ephialtes, was, assassinated, by, personal, enemies, pericles, stepped, in, and, was, elected, general, or, strategos, in, 445, bc, a, post, he, held, continuously, until, his, death, in, 429, bc, always, by, election, of, the, athenian, assembly, the, parthenon, a, lavishly, decorated, temple, to, the, goddess, athena, was, constructed, under, the, administration, of, pericles, resentment, by, other, cities, at, the, hegemony, of, athens, led, to, the, peloponnesian, war, in, 431, which, pitted, athens, and, her, increasingly, rebellious, sea, empire, against, a, coalition, of, land, based, states, led, by, sparta, the, conflict, marked, the, end, of, athenian, command, of, the, sea, the, war, between, athens, and, the, city, state, sparta, ended, with, an, athenian, defeat, after, sparta, started, its, own, navy, athenian, democracy, was, briefly, overthrown, by, the, coup, of, 411, brought, about, because, of, its, poor, handling, of, the, war, but, it, was, quickly, restored, the, war, ended, with, the, complete, defeat, of, athens, in, 404, since, the, defeat, was, largely, blamed, on, democratic, politicians, such, as, cleon, and, cleophon, there, was, a, brief, reaction, against, democracy, aided, by, the, spartan, army, the, rule, of, the, thirty, tyrants, in, 403, democracy, was, restored, by, thrasybulus, and, an, amnesty, declared, sparta, s, former, allies, soon, turned, against, her, due, to, her, imperialist, policies, and, athens, s, former, enemies, thebes, and, corinth, became, her, allies, argos, thebes, and, corinth, allied, with, athens, fought, against, sparta, in, the, corinthian, war, of, 395, 387, bc, in, 378, the, attempt, of, the, spartan, commander, sphodrias, to, capture, piraeus, by, surprise, triggered, athens, to, establish, the, second, athenian, league, finally, thebes, defeated, sparta, in, 371, in, the, battle, of, leuctra, however, other, greek, cities, including, athens, turned, against, thebes, and, its, dominance, was, brought, to, an, end, at, the, battle, of, mantinea, 362, bc, with, the, death, of, its, leader, the, military, genius, epaminondas, by, mid, century, however, the, northern, greek, kingdom, of, macedon, was, becoming, dominant, in, athenian, affairs, in, 338, bc, the, armies, of, philip, ii, defeated, athens, at, the, battle, of, chaeronea, effectively, limiting, athenian, independence, during, the, winter, of, 338, 37, bc, macedonia, athens, and, other, greek, states, became, part, of, the, league, of, corinth, further, the, conquests, of, his, son, alexander, the, great, widened, greek, horizons, and, made, the, traditional, greek, city, state, obsolete, antipater, dissolved, the, athenian, government, and, established, a, plutocratic, system, in, 322, bc, see, lamian, war, and, demetrius, phalereus, athens, remained, a, wealthy, city, with, a, brilliant, cultural, life, but, ceased, to, be, an, independent, power, athens, was, in, attica, about, 30, stadia, from, the, sea, on, the, southwest, slope, of, mount, lycabettus, between, the, small, rivers, cephissus, to, the, west, ilissos, to, the, south, and, the, eridanos, to, the, north, the, latter, of, which, flowed, through, the, town, the, walled, city, measured, about, 1, 5, km, 0, 93, mi, in, diameter, although, at, its, peak, the, city, had, suburbs, extending, well, beyond, these, walls, the, acropolis, was, just, south, of, the, centre, of, this, walled, area, the, city, was, burnt, by, xerxes, in, 480, bc, but, was, soon, rebuilt, under, the, administration, of, themistocles, and, was, adorned, with, public, buildings, by, cimon, and, especially, by, pericles, in, whose, time, 461, 429, bc, it, reached, its, greatest, splendour, its, beauty, was, chiefly, due, to, its, public, buildings, for, the, private, houses, were, mostly, insignificant, and, its, streets, badly, laid, out, towards, the, end, of, the, peloponnesian, war, it, contained, more, than, 10, 000, houses, which, at, a, rate, of, 12, inhabitants, to, a, house, would, give, a, population, of, 120, 000, though, some, writers, make, the, inhabitants, as, many, as, 180, 000, athens, consisted, of, two, distinct, parts, the, city, was, surrounded, by, defensive, walls, from, the, bronze, age, and, they, were, rebuilt, and, extended, over, the, centuries, in, addition, the, long, walls, consisted, of, two, parallel, walls, leading, to, piraeus, 40, stadia, long, 4, 5, miles, 7, km, running, parallel, to, each, other, with, a, narrow, passage, between, them, and, furthermore, a, wall, to, phalerum, on, the, east, 35, stadia, long, 4, miles, 6, 5, km, there, were, therefore, three, long, walls, in, all, but, the, name, long, walls, seems, to, have, been, confined, to, the, two, leading, to, the, piraeus, while, the, one, leading, to, phalerum, was, called, the, phalerian, wall, the, entire, circuit, of, the, walls, was, 174, 5, stadia, nearly, 22, miles, 35, km, of, which, 43, stadia, 5, 5, miles, 9, km, belonged, to, the, city, 75, stadia, 9, 5, miles, 15, km, to, the, long, walls, and, 56, 5, stadia, 7, miles, 11, km, to, piraeus,

surrounded, by, an, ancient, cyclopean, wall, said, to, have, been, built, by, the, pelasgians, at, the, time, of, the, peloponnesian, war, only, the, north, part, of, this, wall, remained, and, this, portion, was, still, called, the, pelasgic, wall, while, the, south, part, which, had, been, rebuilt, by, cimon, was, called, the, cimonian, wall, on, the, west, end, of, the, acropolis, where, access, is, alone, practicable, were, the, magnificent, propylaea, the, entrances, built, by, pericles, before, the, right, wing, of, which, was, the, small, temple, of, athena, nike, the, summit, of, the, acropolis, was, covered, with, temples, statues, of, bronze, and, marble, and, various, other, works, of, art, of, the, temples, the, grandest, was, the, parthenon, sacred, to, the, virgin, goddess, athena, and, north, of, the, parthenon, was, the, magnificent, erechtheion, containing, three, separate, temples, one, to, athena, polias, or, the, protectress, of, the, state, the, erechtheion, proper, or, sanctuary, of, erechtheus, and, the, pandroseion, or, sanctuary, of, pandrosos, the, daughter, of, cecrops, between, the, parthenon, and, erechtheion, was, the, colossal,
