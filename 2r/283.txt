the, conquest, of, constantinople, was, the, capture, of, the, capital, of, the, byzantine, empire, by, the, ottoman, empire, the, city, was, captured, on, 29, may, 1453, as, part, of, the, culmination, of, a, 53, day, siege, which, had, begun, on, 6, april, the, attacking, ottoman, army, which, significantly, outnumbered, constantinople, s, defenders, was, commanded, by, the, 21, year, old, sultan, mehmed, ii, later, nicknamed, the, conqueror, while, the, byzantine, army, was, led, by, emperor, constantine, xi, palaiologos, after, conquering, the, city, mehmed, ii, made, constantinople, the, new, ottoman, capital, replacing, adrianople, the, fall, of, constantinople, and, of, the, byzantine, empire, was, a, watershed, of, the, late, middle, ages, marking, the, effective, end, of, the, roman, empire, a, state, which, began, in, roughly, 27, bc, and, had, lasted, nearly, 1500, years, for, many, modern, historians, the, fall, of, constantinople, marks, the, end, of, the, medieval, period, and, the, beginning, of, the, early, modern, period, the, city, s, fall, also, stood, as, a, turning, point, in, military, history, since, ancient, times, cities, and, castles, had, depended, upon, ramparts, and, walls, to, repel, invaders, the, walls, of, constantinople, especially, the, theodosian, walls, were, some, of, the, most, advanced, defensive, systems, in, the, world, at, the, time, for, 800, years, the, theodosian, walls, regarded, by, historians, as, the, strongest, and, most, fortified, walls, in, the, ancient, and, medieval, era, protected, constantinople, from, attack, however, these, fortifications, were, overcome, with, the, use, of, gunpowder, specifically, from, ottoman, cannons, and, bombards, heralding, a, change, in, siege, warfare, the, ottoman, cannons, repeatedly, fired, massive, cannonballs, weighing, 500, kilograms, 1, 100, lb, over, 1, 5, kilometres, 0, 93, mi, which, created, gaps, in, the, theodosian, walls, for, the, ottoman, siege, constantinople, had, been, an, imperial, capital, since, its, consecration, in, 330, under, roman, emperor, constantine, the, great, in, the, following, eleven, centuries, the, city, had, been, besieged, many, times, but, was, captured, only, once, before, the, sack, of, constantinople, during, the, fourth, crusade, in, 1204, the, crusaders, established, an, unstable, latin, state, in, and, around, constantinople, while, the, remainder, of, the, byzantine, empire, splintered, into, a, number, of, successor, states, notably, nicaea, epirus, and, trebizond, they, fought, as, allies, against, the, latin, establishments, but, also, fought, among, themselves, for, the, byzantine, throne, the, nicaeans, eventually, reconquered, constantinople, from, the, latins, in, 1261, reestablishing, the, byzantine, empire, under, the, palaiologos, dynasty, thereafter, there, was, little, peace, for, the, much, weakened, empire, as, it, fended, off, successive, attacks, by, the, latins, serbs, bulgarians, and, ottoman, turks, between, 1346, and, 1349, the, black, death, killed, almost, half, of, the, inhabitants, of, constantinople, the, city, was, further, depopulated, by, the, general, economic, and, territorial, decline, of, the, empire, and, by, 1453, it, consisted, of, a, series, of, walled, villages, separated, by, vast, fields, encircled, by, the, fifth, century, theodosian, walls, by, 1450, the, empire, was, exhausted, and, had, shrunk, to, a, few, square, kilometers, outside, the, city, of, constantinople, itself, the, princes, islands, in, the, sea, of, marmara, and, the, peloponnese, with, its, cultural, center, at, mystras, the, empire, of, trebizond, an, independent, successor, state, that, formed, in, the, aftermath, of, the, fourth, crusade, was, also, present, at, the, time, on, the, coast, of, the, black, sea, when, mehmed, ii, succeeded, his, father, in, 1451, he, was, 19, years, old, many, european, courts, assumed, that, the, young, ottoman, ruler, would, not, seriously, challenge, christian, hegemony, in, the, balkans, and, the, aegean, in, fact, europe, celebrated, mehmed, coming, to, the, throne, and, hoped, his, inexperience, would, lead, the, ottomans, astray, this, calculation, was, boosted, by, mehmed, s, friendly, overtures, to, the, european, envoys, at, his, new, court, but, mehmed, s, mild, words, were, not, matched, by, his, actions, by, early, 1452, work, began, on, the, construction, of, a, second, fortress, rumeli, hisar, on, the, european, side, of, the, bosphorus, several, miles, north, of, constantinople, the, new, fortress, sat, directly, across, the, strait, from, the, anadolu, hisar, fortress, built, by, mehmed, s, great, grandfather, bayezid, i, this, pair, of, fortresses, ensured, complete, control, of, sea, traffic, on, the, bosphorus, and, defended, against, attack, by, the, genoese, colonies, on, the, black, sea, coast, to, the, north, in, fact, the, new, fortress, was, called, bo, azkesen, which, means, strait, blocker, or, throat, cutter, the, wordplay, emphasizes, its, strategic, position, in, turkish, bo, az, means, both, strait, and, throat, in, october, 1452, mehmed, ordered, turakhan, beg, to, station, a, large, garrison, force, in, the, peloponnese, to, block, thomas, and, demetrios, despotes, in, southern, greece, from, providing, aid, to, their, brother, constantine, xi, palaiologos, during, the, impending, siege, of, constantinople, karaca, pasha, the, beylerbeyi, of, rumelia, sent, men, to, prepare, the, roads, from, adrianople, to, constantinople, so, that, bridges, could, cope, with, the, massive, cannons, fifty, carpenters, and, 200, artisans, also, strengthened, the, roads, where, necessary, the, greek, historian, michael, critobulus, quotes, mehmed, ii, s, speech, to, his, soldiers, before, the, siege, my, friends, and, men, of, my, empire, you, all, know, very, well, that, our, forefathers, secured, this, kingdom, that, we, now, hold, at, the, cost, of, many, struggles, and, very, great, dangers, and, that, having, passed, it, along, in, succession, from, their, fathers, from, father, to, son, they, handed, it, down, to, me, for, some, of, the, oldest, of, you, were, sharers, in, many, of, the, exploits, carried, through, by, them, those, at, least, of, you, who, are, of, maturer, years, and, the, younger, of, you, have, heard, of, these, deeds, from, your, fathers, they, are, not, such, very, ancient, events, nor, of, such, a, sort, as, to, be, forgotten, through, the, lapse, of, time, still, the, eyewitness, of, those, who, have, seen, testifies, better, than, does, the, hearing, of, deeds, that, happened, but, yesterday, or, the, day, before, byzantine, emperor, constantine, xi, swiftly, understood, mehmed, s, true, intentions, and, turned, to, western, europe, for, help, but, now, the, price, of, centuries, of, war, and, enmity, between, the, eastern, and, western, churches, had, to, be, paid, since, the, mutual, excommunications, of, 1054, the, pope, in, rome, was, committed, to, establishing, unity, with, the, eastern, church, the, union, was, agreed, by, the, byzantine, emperor, michael, viii, palaiologos, in, 1274, at, the, second, council, of, lyon, and, indeed, some, palaiologoi, emperors, had, since, been, received, into, the, latin, church, emperor, john, viii, palaiologos, had, also, recently, negotiated, union, with, pope, eugene, iv, with, the, council, of, florence, of, 1439, proclaiming, a, bull, of, union, the, imperial, efforts, to, impose, union, were, met, with, strong, resistance, in, constantinople, a, propaganda, initiative, was, stimulated, by, anti, unionist, orthodox, partisans, in, constantinople, the, population, as, well, as, the, laity, and, leadership, of, the, byzantine, church, became, bitterly, divided, latent, ethnic, hatred, between, greeks, and, italians, stemming, from, the, events, of, the, massacre, of, the, latins, in, 1182, by, the, greeks, and, the, sack, of, constantinople, in, 1204, by, the, latins, played, a, significant, role, ultimately, the, attempted, union, between, east, and, west, failed, greatly, annoying, pope, nicholas, v, and, the, hierarchy, of, the, roman, church, in, the, summer, of, 1452, when, rumeli, hisar, was, completed, and, the, threat, of, the, ottomans, had, become, imminent, constantine, wrote, to, the, pope, promising, to, implement, the, union, which, was, declared, valid, by, a, half, hearted, imperial, court, on, 12, december, 1452, although, he, was, eager, for, an, advantage, pope, nicholas, v, did, not, have, the, influence, the, byzantines, thought, he, had, over, the, western, kings, and, princes, some, of, whom, were, wary, of, increasing, papal, control, furthermore, these, western, rulers, did, not, have, the, wherewithal, to, contribute, to, the, effort, especially, in, light, of, the, weakened, state, of, france, and, england, from, the, hundred, years, war, spain, s, involvement, in, the, reconquista, the, internecine, fighting, in, the, holy, roman, empire, and, hungary, and, poland, s, defeat, at, the, battle, of, varna, of, 1444, although, some, troops, did, arrive, from, the, mercantile, city, states, in, northern, italy, the, western, contribution, was, not, adequate, to, counterbalance, ottoman, strength, some, western, individuals, however, came, to, help, defend, the, city, on, their, own, account, cardinal, isidore, funded, by, the, pope, arrived, in, 1452, with, 200, archers, an, accomplished, soldier, from, genoa, giovanni, giustiniani, arrived, in, january, 1453, with, 400, men, from, genoa, and, 300, men, from, genoese, chios, as, a, specialist, in, defending, walled, cities, giustiniani, was, immediately, given, the, overall, command, of, the, defence, of, the, land, walls, by, the, emperor, the, byzantines, knew, him, by, the, latin, spelling, of, his, name, john, justinian, named, after, the, famous, 6th, century, byzantine, emperor, justinian, the, great, around, the, same, time, the, captains, of, the, venetian, ships, that, happened, to, be, present, in, the, golden, horn, offered, their, services, to, the, emperor, barring, contrary, orders, from, venice, and, pope, nicholas, undertook, to, send, three, ships, laden, with, provisions, which, set, sail, near, the, end, of, march, from, the, kingdoms, of, naples, and, sicily, arrived, in, constantinople, the, condottiero, gabriele, orsini, del, balzo, duke, of, venosa, and, count, of, ugento, together, with, 200, neapolitan, archers, who, died, fighting, for, the, defense, of, the, capital, of, the, byzantine, empire, meanwhile, in, venice, deliberations, were, taking, place, concerning, the, kind, of, assistance, the, republic, would, lend, to, constantinople, the, senate, decided, upon, sending, a, fleet, in, february, 1453, but, the, fleet, s, departure, was, delayed, until, april, when, it, was, already, too, late, for, ships, to, assist, in, battle, further, undermining, byzantine, morale, seven, italian, ships, with, around, 700, men, despite, having, sworn, to, defend, constantinople, slipped, out, of, the, capital, the, moment, giustiniani, arrived, at, the, same, time, constantine, s, attempts, to, appease, the, sultan, with, gifts, ended, with, the, execution, of, the, emperor, s, ambassadors, fearing, a, possible, naval, attack, along, the, shores, of, the, golden, horn, emperor, constantine, xi, ordered, that, a, defensive, chain, be, placed, at, the, mouth, of, the, harbour, this, chain, which, floated, on, logs, was, strong, enough, to, prevent, any, turkish, ship, from, entering, the, harbour, this, device, was, one, of, two, that, gave, the, byzantines, some, hope, of, extending, the, siege, until, the, possible, arrival, of, foreign, help, this, strategy, was, used, because, in, 1204, the, armies, of, the, fourth, crusade, successfully, circumvented, constantinople, s, land, defences, by, breaching, the, golden, horn, wall, which, faces, the, horn, another, strategy, employed, by, the, byzantines, was, the, repair, and, fortification, of, the, land, wall, theodosian, walls, emperor, constantine, deemed, it, necessary, to, ensure, that, the, blachernae, district, s, wall, was, the, most, fortified, because, that, section, of, the, wall, protruded, northwards, the, land, fortifications, consisted, of, a, 60, ft, 18, m, wide, moat, fronting, inner, and, outer, crenellated, walls, studded, with, towers, every, 45, 55, metres, the, army, defending, constantinople, was, relatively, small, totalling, about, 7, 000, men, 2, 000, of, whom, were, foreigners, the, population, decline, also, had, a, huge, impact, upon, the, constantinople, s, defense, capabilities, at, the, end, of, march, 1453, emperor, constantine, xi, ordered, a, census, of, districts, to, record, how, many, able, bodied, men, were, in, the, city, and, whatever, weapons, each, possessed, for, defense, george, sphrantzes, the, faithful, chancellor, of, the, last, emperor, recorded, that, in, spite, of, the, great, size, of, our, city, our, defenders, amounted, to, 4, 773, greeks, as, well, as, just, 200, foreigners, in, addition, there, were, volunteers, from, outside, the, genoese, venetians, and, those, who, came, secretly, from, galata, to, help, the, defense, who, numbered, hardly, as, many, as, three, thousand, amounting, to, something, under, 8, 000, men, in, total, to, defend, a, perimeter, wall, of, twelve, miles, at, the, onset, of, the, siege, probably, fewer, than, 50, 000, people, were, living, within, the, walls, including, the, refugees, from, the, surrounding, area, turkish, commander, dorgano, who, was, in, constantinople, working, for, the, emperor, was, also, guarding, one, of, the, quarters, of, the, city, on, the, seaward, side, with, the, turks, in, his, pay, these, turks, kept, loyal, to, the, emperor, and, perished, in, the, ensuing, battle, the, defending, army, s, genoese, corps, were, well, trained, and, equipped, while, the, rest, of, the, army, consisted, of, small, numbers, of, well, trained, soldiers, armed, civilians, sailors, and, volunteer, forces, from, foreign, communities, and, finally, monks, the, garrison, used, a, few, small, calibre, artillery, pieces, which, in, the, end, proved, ineffective, the, rest, of, the, citizens, repaired, walls, stood, guard, on, observation, posts, collected, and, distributed, food, provisions, and, collected, gold, and, silver, objects, from, churches, to, melt, down, into, coins, to, pay, the, foreign, soldiers, the, ottomans, had, a, much, larger, force, recent, studies, and, ottoman, archival, data, state, that, there, were, some, 50, 000, 80, 000, ottoman, soldiers, including, between, 5, 000, and, 10, 000, janissaries, 70, cannons, and, an, elite, infantry, corps, and, thousands, of, christian, troops, notably, 1, 500, serbian, cavalry, that, ura, brankovi, was, forced, to, supply, as, part, of, his, obligation, to, the, ottoman, sultan, just, a, few, months, before, brankovi, had, supplied, the, money, for, the, reconstruction, of, the, walls, of, constantinople, contemporaneous, western, witnesses, of, the, siege, who, tend, to, exaggerate, the, military, power, of, the, sultan, provide, disparate, and, higher, numbers, ranging, from, 160, 000, to, 300, 000, niccol, barbaro, 160, 000, the, florentine, merchant, jacopo, tedaldi, and, the, great, logothete, george, sphrantzes, 200, 000, the, cardinal, isidore, of, kiev, and, the, archbishop, of, mytilene, leonardo, di, chio, 300, 000, mehmed, built, a, fleet, crewed, partially, by, spanish, sailors, from, gallipoli, to, besiege, the, city, from, the, sea, contemporary, estimates, of, the, strength, of, the, ottoman, fleet, span, from, 110, ships, to, 430, tedaldi, 110, barbaro, 145, ubertino, pusculo, 160, isidore, of, kiev, and, leonardo, di, chio, 200, 250, sphrantzes, 430, a, more, realistic, modern, estimate, predicts, a, fleet, strength, of, 110, ships, comprising, 70, large, galleys, 5, ordinary, galleys, 10, smaller, galleys, 25, large, rowing, boats, and, 75, horse, transports, before, the, siege, of, constantinople, it, was, known, that, the, ottomans, had, the, ability, to, cast, medium, sized, cannons, but, the, range, of, some, pieces, they, were, able, to, field, far, surpassed, the, defenders, expectations, the, ottomans, deployed, a, number, of, cannons, anywhere, from, 12, to, 62, cannons, they, were, built, at, foundries, that, employed, turkish, cannon, founders, and, technicians, most, notably, saruca, in, addition, to, at, least, one, foreign, cannon, founder, orban, also, called, urban, most, of, the, cannons, at, the, siege, were, built, by, turkish, engineers, including, a, large, bombard, by, saruca, while, one, cannon, was, built, by, orban, who, also, contributed, a, large, bombard, orban, a, hungarian, though, some, suggest, he, was, german, was, a, somewhat, mysterious, figure, his, 27, foot, long, 8, 2, m, cannon, was, named, basilica, and, was, able, to, hurl, a, 600, pound, 270, kg, stone, ball, over, a, mile, 1, 6, km, orban, initially, tried, to, sell, his, services, to, the, byzantines, but, they, were, unable, to, secure, the, funds, needed, to, hire, him, orban, then, left, constantinople, and, approached, mehmed, ii, claiming, that, his, weapon, could, blast, the, walls, of, babylon, itself, given, abundant, funds, and, materials, the, hungarian, engineer, built, the, gun, within, three, months, at, edirne, however, this, was, the, only, cannon, that, orban, built, for, the, ottoman, forces, at, constantinople, and, it, had, several, drawbacks, it, took, three, hours, to, reload, cannonballs, were, in, very, short, supply, and, the, cannon, is, said, to, have, collapsed, under, its, own, recoil, after, six, weeks, the, account, of, the, cannon, s, collapse, is, disputed, given, that, it, was, only, reported, in, the, letter, of, archbishop, leonardo, di, chio, and, in, the, later, and, often, unreliable, russian, chronicle, of, nestor, iskander, having, previously, established, a, large, foundry, about, 150, miles, 240, km, away, mehmed, now, had, to, undertake, the, painstaking, process, of, transporting, his, massive, artillery, pieces, in, preparation, for, the, final, assault, mehmed, had, an, artillery, train, of, 70, large, pieces, dragged, from, his, headquarters, at, edirne, in, addition, to, the, bombards, cast, on, the, spot, this, train, included, orban, s, enormous, cannon, which, was, said, to, have, been, dragged, from, edirne, by, a, crew, of, 60, oxen, and, over, 400, men, there, was, another, large, bombard, independently, built, by, turkish, engineer, saruca, that, was, also, used, in, the, battle, mehmed, planned, to, attack, the, theodosian, walls, the, intricate, series, of, walls, and, ditches, protecting, constantinople, from, an, attack, from, the, west, and, the, only, part, of, the, city, not, surrounded, by, water, his, army, encamped, outside, the, city, on, 2, april, 1453, the, monday, after, easter, the, bulk, of, the, ottoman, army, was, encamped, south, of, the, golden, horn, the, regular, european, troops, stretched, out, along, the, entire, length, of, the, walls, were, commanded, by, karadja, pasha, the, regular, troops, from, anatolia, under, ishak, pasha, were, stationed, south, of, the, lycus, down, to, the, sea, of, marmara, mehmed, himself, erected, his, red, and, gold, tent, near, the, mesoteichion, where, the, guns, and, the, elite, janissary, regiments, were, positioned, the, bashi, bazouks, were, spread, out, behind, the, front, lines, other, troops, under, zagan, pasha, were, employed, north, of, the, golden, horn, communication, was, maintained, by, a, road, that, had, been, destroyed, over, the, marshy, head, of, the, horn, the, ottomans, were, experts, in, laying, siege, to, cities, they, knew, that, in, order, to, prevent, diseases, they, had, to, burn, corpses, sanitarily, dispose, of, excrement, and, carefully, scrutinize, their, sources, of, water, the, city, had, about, 20, km, of, walls, land, walls, 5, 5, km, sea, walls, along, the, golden, horn, 7, km, sea, walls, along, the, sea, of, marmara, 7, 5, km, one, of, the, strongest, sets, of, fortified, walls, in, existence, the, walls, had, recently, been, repaired, under, john, viii, and, were, in, fairly, good, shape, giving, the, defenders, sufficient, reason, to, believe, that, they, could, hold, out, until, help, from, the, west, arrived, in, addition, the, defenders, were, relatively, well, equipped, with, a, fleet, of, 26, ships, 5, from, genoa, 5, from, venice, 3, from, venetian, crete, 1, from, ancona, 1, from, aragon, 1, from, france, and, about, 10, from, the, empire, itself, on, 5, april, the, sultan, himself, arrived, with, his, last, troops, and, the, defenders, took, up, their, positions, as, byzantine, numbers, were, insufficient, to, occupy, the, walls, in, their, entirety, it, had, been, decided, that, only, the, outer, walls, would, be, guarded, constantine, and, his, greek, troops, guarded, the, mesoteichion, the, middle, section, of, the, land, walls, where, they, were, crossed, by, the, river, lycus, this, section, was, considered, the, weakest, spot, in, the, walls, and, an, attack, was, feared, here, most, giustiniani, was, stationed, to, the, north, of, the, emperor, at, the, charisian, gate, myriandrion, later, during, the, siege, he, was, shifted, to, the, mesoteichion, to, join, constantine, leaving, the, myriandrion, to, the, charge, of, the, bocchiardi, brothers, girolamo, minotto, and, his, venetians, were, stationed, in, the, blachernae, palace, together, with, teodoro, caristo, the, langasco, brothers, and, archbishop, leonardo, of, chios, to, the, left, of, the, emperor, further, south, were, the, commanders, cataneo, who, led, genoese, troops, and, theophilus, palaeologus, who, guarded, the, pegae, gate, with, greek, soldiers, the, section, of, the, land, walls, from, the, pegae, gate, to, the, golden, gate, itself, guarded, by, a, genoese, called, manuel, was, defended, by, the, venetian, filippo, contarini, while, demetrius, cantacuzenus, had, taken, position, on, the, southernmost, part, of, the, theodosian, wall, the, sea, walls, were, guarded, more, sparsely, with, jacobo, contarini, at, stoudion, a, makeshift, defence, force, of, greek, monks, to, his, left, hand, and, prince, orhan, at, the, harbour, of, eleutherios, genoese, and, catalan, troops, were, stationed, at, the, great, palace, cardinal, isidore, of, kiev, guarded, the, tip, of, the, peninsula, near, the, boom, finally, the, sea, walls, at, the, southern, shore, of, the, golden, horn, were, defended, by, venetian, and, genoese, sailors, under, gabriele, trevisano, two, tactical, reserves, were, kept, behind, in, the, city, one, in, the, petra, district, just, behind, the, land, walls, and, one, near, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, under, the, command, of, loukas, notaras, and, nicephorus, palaeologus, respectively, the, venetian, alviso, diedo, commanded, the, ships, in, the, harbour, although, the, byzantines, also, had, cannons, the, weapons, were, much, smaller, than, those, of, the, ottomans, and, the, recoil, tended, to, damage, their, own, walls, according, to, david, nicolle, despite, many, odds, the, idea, that, constantinople, was, inevitably, doomed, is, incorrect, and, the, situation, was, not, as, one, sided, as, a, simple, glance, at, a, map, might, suggest, it, has, also, been, claimed, that, constantinople, was, the, best, defended, city, in, europe, at, that, time, at, the, beginning, of, the, siege, mehmed, sent, out, some, of, his, best, troops, to, reduce, the, remaining, byzantine, strongholds, outside, the, city, of, constantinople, the, fortress, of, therapia, on, the, bosphorus, and, a, smaller, castle, at, the, village, of, studius, near, the, sea, of, marmara, were, taken, within, a, few, days, the, princes, islands, in, the, sea, of, marmara, were, likely, taken, by, admiral, baltoghlu, s, fleet, during, this, phase, of, the, siege, mehmed, s, massive, cannons, fired, on, the, walls, for, weeks, but, due, to, their, imprecision, and, extremely, slow, rate, of, fire, the, byzantines, were, able, to, repair, most, of, the, damage, after, each, shot, mitigating, the, effect, of, the, ottoman, artillery, despite, some, probing, attacks, the, ottoman, fleet, under, baltoghlu, could, not, enter, the, golden, horn, due, to, the, chain, across, the, entrance, although, one, of, the, fleet, s, main, tasks, was, to, prevent, any, foreign, ships, from, entering, the, golden, horn, on, 20, april, a, small, flotilla, of, four, christian, ships, managed, to, get, in, after, some, heavy, fighting, an, event, which, strengthened, the, morale, of, the, defenders, and, caused, embarrassment, to, the, sultan, baltoghlu, was, most, likely, injured, in, the, eye, during, the, skirmish, mehmed, stripped, baltoghlu, of, his, wealth, and, property, and, gave, it, to, the, janissaries, and, ordered, him, to, be, whipped, 100, times, mehmed, ordered, the, construction, of, a, road, of, greased, logs, across, galata, on, the, north, side, of, the, golden, horn, and, dragged, his, ships, over, the, hill, directly, into, the, golden, horn, on, 22, april, bypassing, the, chain, barrier, this, action, seriously, threatened, the, flow, of, supplies, from, genoese, ships, from, the, nominally, neutral, colony, of, pera, and, it, demoralized, the, byzantine, defenders, on, the, night, of, 28, april, an, attempt, was, made, to, destroy, the, ottoman, ships, already, in, the, golden, horn, using, fire, ships, but, the, ottomans, forced, the, christians, to, retreat, with, many, casualties, forty, italians, escaped, their, sinking, ships, and, swam, to, the, northern, shore, on, orders, of, mehmed, they, were, impaled, on, stakes, in, sight, of, the, city, s, defenders, on, the, sea, walls, across, the, golden, horn, in, retaliation, the, defenders, brought, their, ottoman, prisoners, 260, in, all, to, the, walls, where, they, were, executed, one, by, one, before, the, eyes, of, the, ottomans, with, the, failure, of, their, attack, on, the, ottoman, vessels, the, defenders, were, forced, to, disperse, part, of, their, forces, to, defend, the, sea, walls, along, the, golden, horn, the, ottoman, army, had, made, several, frontal, assaults, on, the, land, wall, of, constantinople, but, they, were, costly, failures, venetian, surgeon, niccol, barbaro, describing, in, his, diary, one, such, land, attack, by, the, janissaries, wrote, they, found, the, turks, coming, right, up, under, the, walls, and, seeking, battle, particularly, the, janissaries, and, when, one, or, two, of, them, were, killed, at, once, more, turks, came, and, took, away, the, dead, ones, without, caring, how, near, they, came, to, the, city, walls, our, men, shot, at, them, with, guns, and, crossbows, aiming, at, the, turk, who, was, carrying, away, his, dead, countryman, and, both, of, them, would, fall, to, the, ground, dead, and, then, there, came, other, turks, and, took, them, away, none, fearing, death, but, being, willing, to, let, ten, of, themselves, be, killed, rather, than, suffer, the, shame, of, leaving, a, single, turkish, corpse, by, the, walls, after, these, inconclusive, attacks, the, ottomans, sought, to, break, through, the, walls, by, constructing, tunnels, to, mine, them, from, mid, may, to, 25, may, many, of, the, sappers, were, miners, of, serbian, origin, sent, from, novo, brdo, under, the, command, of, zagan, pasha, an, engineer, named, johannes, grant, a, german, who, came, with, the, genoese, contingent, had, counter, mines, dug, allowing, byzantine, troops, to, enter, the, mines, and, kill, the, miners, the, byzantines, intercepted, the, first, tunnel, on, the, night, of, 16, may, subsequent, tunnels, were, interrupted, on, 21, 23, and, 25, may, and, destroyed, with, greek, fire, and, vigorous, combat, on, 23, may, the, byzantines, captured, and, tortured, two, turkish, officers, who, revealed, the, location, of, all, the, turkish, tunnels, which, were, destroyed, on, 21, may, mehmed, sent, an, ambassador, to, constantinople, and, offered, to, lift, the, siege, if, they, gave, him, the, city, he, promised, he, would, allow, the, emperor, and, any, other, inhabitants, to, leave, with, their, possessions, he, would, recognize, the, emperor, as, governor, of, the, peloponnese, lastly, he, guaranteed, the, safety, of, the, population, that, might, choose, to, remain, in, the, city, constantine, xi, only, agreed, to, pay, higher, tributes, to, the, sultan, and, recognized, the, status, of, all, the, conquered, castles, and, lands, in, the, hands, of, the, turks, as, ottoman, possessions, the, emperor, was, not, willing, to, leave, the, city, without, a, fight, as, to, surrendering, the, city, to, you, it, is, not, for, me, to, decide, or, for, anyone, else, of, its, citizens, for, all, of, us, have, reached, the, mutual, decision, to, die, of, our, own, free, will, without, any, regard, for, our, lives, around, this, time, mehmed, had, a, final, council, with, his, senior, officers, here, he, encountered, some, resistance, one, of, his, viziers, the, veteran, halil, pasha, who, had, always, disapproved, of, mehmed, s, plans, to, conquer, the, city, now, admonished, him, to, abandon, the, siege, in, the, face, of, recent, adversity, zagan, pasha, argued, against, halil, pasha, and, insisted, on, an, immediate, attack, believing, that, the, byzantine, defence, was, already, weakened, sufficiently, mehmed, planned, to, overpower, the, walls, by, sheer, force, and, started, preparations, for, a, final, all, out, offensive, preparations, for, the, final, assault, began, in, the, evening, of, 26, may, and, continued, to, the, next, day, for, 36, hours, after, the, war, council, decided, to, attack, the, ottomans, extensively, mobilized, their, manpower, for, the, general, offensive, prayer, and, resting, was, then, granted, to, the, soldiers, on, 28, may, before, the, final, assault, would, be, launched, on, the, byzantine, side, a, small, venetian, fleet, of, 12, ships, after, having, searched, the, aegean, reached, the, capital, on, 27, may, and, reported, to, the, emperor, that, no, large, venetian, relief, fleet, was, on, its, way, on, 28, may, as, the, ottoman, army, prepared, for, the, final, assault, mass, religious, processions, were, held, in, the, city, in, the, evening, a, solemn, last, ceremony, of, vespers, was, held, in, the, hagia, sophia, in, which, the, emperor, with, representatives, and, nobility, of, both, the, latin, and, greek, churches, partook, up, until, this, point, the, ottomans, had, fired, 5, 000, shots, from, their, cannons, using, 55, 000, pounds, of, gunpowder, criers, roamed, the, camp, to, the, sound, of, the, blasting, horns, rousing, the, ghazis, shortly, after, midnight, on, tuesday, 29, may, the, offensive, began, the, christian, troops, of, the, ottoman, empire, attacked, first, followed, by, successive, waves, of, the, irregular, azaps, who, were, poorly, trained, and, equipped, and, anatolian, turkmen, beylik, forces, who, focused, on, a, section, of, the, damaged, blachernae, walls, in, the, north, west, part, of, the, city, this, section, of, the, walls, had, been, built, earlier, in, the, 11th, century, and, was, much, weaker, the, turkmen, mercenaries, managed, to, breach, this, section, of, walls, and, entered, the, city, but, they, were, just, as, quickly, pushed, back, by, the, defenders, finally, the, last, wave, consisting, of, elite, janissaries, attacked, the, city, walls, the, genoese, general, in, charge, of, the, defenders, on, land, giovanni, giustiniani, was, grievously, wounded, during, the, attack, and, his, evacuation, from, the, ramparts, caused, a, panic, in, the, ranks, of, the, defenders, with, giustiniani, s, genoese, troops, retreating, into, the, city, and, towards, the, harbour, constantine, and, his, men, now, left, to, their, own, devices, continued, to, hold, their, ground, against, the, janissaries, constantine, s, men, eventually, could, not, prevent, the, ottomans, from, entering, the, city, and, the, defenders, were, overwhelmed, at, several, points, along, the, wall, janissaries, led, by, ulubatl, hasan, pressed, forward, many, greek, soldiers, ran, back, home, to, protect, their, families, the, venetians, retreated, to, their, ships, and, a, few, of, the, genoese, escaped, to, galata, the, rest, surrendered, or, committed, suicide, by, jumping, off, the, city, walls, the, greek, houses, nearest, to, the, walls, were, the, first, to, suffer, from, the, ottomans, it, is, said, that, constantine, throwing, aside, his, purple, imperial, regalia, led, the, final, charge, against, the, incoming, ottomans, perishing, in, the, ensuing, battle, in, the, streets, alongside, his, soldiers, the, venetian, nicol, barbaro, claimed, in, his, diary, that, constantine, hanged, himself, at, the, moment, when, the, turks, broke, in, at, the, san, romano, gate, ultimately, his, fate, remains, unknown, after, the, initial, assault, the, ottoman, army, fanned, out, along, the, main, thoroughfare, of, the, city, the, mese, past, the, great, forums, and, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, which, mehmed, ii, wanted, to, provide, as, a, seat, for, his, newly, appointed, patriarch, to, better, control, his, christian, subjects, mehmed, ii, had, sent, an, advance, guard, to, protect, these, key, buildings, the, catalans, that, maintained, their, position, on, the, section, of, the, wall, that, the, emperor, had, assigned, them, had, the, honor, of, being, the, last, troops, to, fall, the, sultan, had, pere, juli, his, sons, and, the, consul, joan, de, la, via, amongst, others, beheaded, a, few, civilians, managed, to, escape, when, the, venetians, retreated, over, to, their, ships, the, ottomans, had, already, taken, the, walls, of, the, golden, horn, luckily, for, the, occupants, of, the, city, the, ottomans, were, not, interested, in, killing, potentially, valuable, slaves, but, rather, in, the, loot, they, could, get, from, raiding, the, city, s, houses, so, they, decided, to, attack, the, city, instead, the, venetian, captain, ordered, his, men, to, break, open, the, gate, of, the, golden, horn, having, done, so, the, venetians, left, in, ships, filled, with, soldiers, and, refugees, shortly, after, the, venetians, left, a, few, genoese, ships, and, even, the, emperor, s, ships, followed, them, out, of, the, golden, horn, this, fleet, narrowly, escaped, prior, to, the, ottoman, navy, assuming, control, over, the, golden, horn, which, was, accomplished, by, midday, the, army, converged, upon, the, augusteum, the, vast, square, that, fronted, the, great, church, of, hagia, sophia, whose, bronze, gates, were, barred, by, a, huge, throng, of, civilians, inside, the, building, hoping, for, divine, protection, after, the, doors, were, breached, the, troops, separated, the, congregation, according, to, what, price, they, might, bring, in, the, slave, markets, ottoman, casualties, are, unknown, but, they, are, believed, by, most, historians, to, be, severe, due, to, several, unsuccessful, ottoman, attacks, made, during, the, siege, and, final, assault, the, venetian, barbaro, observed, that, blood, flowed, in, the, city, like, rainwater, in, the, gutters, after, a, sudden, storm, and, that, bodies, of, turks, and, christians, floated, in, the, sea, like, melons, along, a, canal, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, mehmed, ii, permitted, an, initial, period, of, looting, that, saw, the, destruction, of, many, orthodox, churches, but, tried, to, prevent, a, complete, sack, of, the, city, the, looting, was, extremely, thorough, in, certain, parts, of, the, city, on, 2, june, the, sultan, found, the, city, largely, deserted, and, half, in, ruins, churches, had, been, desecrated, and, stripped, houses, were, no, longer, habitable, and, stores, and, shops, were, emptied, he, is, famously, reported, to, have, been, moved, to, tears, by, this, saying, what, a, city, we, have, given, over, to, plunder, and, destruction, looting, was, carried, out, on, a, massive, scale, by, sailors, and, marines, who, entered, the, city, via, other, walls, before, they, had, been, suppressed, by, regular, troops, who, were, beyond, the, main, gate, according, to, david, nicolle, the, ordinary, people, were, treated, better, by, their, ottoman, conquerors, than, their, ancestors, had, been, by, crusaders, back, in, 1204, stating, that, only, about, 4, 000, greeks, died, in, the, siege, while, according, to, a, venetian, senate, report, 50, venetian, noblemen, and, over, 500, other, venetian, civilians, died, during, the, siege, many, of, the, riches, of, the, city, were, already, looted, in, 1204, leaving, only, limited, loot, to, the, ottomans, other, sources, claim, far, more, brutal, and, successful, pillaging, by, the, ottoman, invaders, leonard, of, chios, made, accounts, of, the, atrocities, that, followed, the, fall, of, constantinople, stated, the, ottoman, invaders, pillaged, the, city, murdered, or, enslaved, tens, of, thousands, of, people, and, raped, nuns, women, and, children, all, the, valuables, and, other, booty, were, taken, to, their, camp, and, as, many, as, sixty, thousand, christians, who, had, been, captured, the, crosses, which, had, been, placed, on, the, roofs, or, the, walls, of, churches, were, torn, down, and, trampled, women, were, raped, virgins, deflowered, and, youths, forced, to, take, part, in, shameful, obscenities, the, nuns, left, behind, even, those, who, were, obviously, such, were, disgraced, with, foul, debaucheries, during, three, days, of, pillaging, the, ottoman, invaders, captured, children, and, took, them, away, to, their, tents, and, became, rich, by, plundering, the, imperial, palace, and, the, houses, of, constantinople, the, ottoman, official, tursun, beg, wrote, after, having, completely, overcome, the, enemy, the, soldiers, began, to, plunder, the, city, they, enslaved, boys, and, girls, and, took, silver, and, gold, vessels, precious, stones, and, all, sorts, of, valuable, goods, and, fabrics, from, the, imperial, palace, and, the, houses, of, the, rich, every, tent, was, filled, with, handsome, boys, and, beautiful, girls, if, any, citizens, of, constantinople, tried, to, resist, they, were, slaughtered, according, to, niccol, barbaro, all, through, the, day, the, turks, made, a, great, slaughter, of, christians, through, the, city, according, to, makarios, melissenos, as, soon, as, the, turks, were, inside, the, city, they, began, to, seize, and, enslave, every, person, who, came, their, way, all, those, who, tried, to, offer, resistance, were, put, to, the, sword, in, many, places, the, ground, could, not, be, seen, as, it, was, covered, by, heaps, of, corpses, the, women, of, constantinople, suffered, from, rape, at, the, hands, of, ottoman, forces, according, to, historian, philip, mansel, widespread, persecution, of, the, city, s, civilian, inhabitants, took, place, resulting, in, thousands, of, murders, and, rapes, the, vast, majority, of, the, citizens, of, constantinople, 30, 000, 50, 000, were, forced, to, become, slaves, they, made, the, people, of, the, city, slaves, and, killed, their, emperor, and, the, gazis, embraced, their, pretty, girls, confirm, ottoman, chroniclers, according, to, nicolas, de, nicolay, slaves, were, displayed, naked, at, the, city, s, slave, market, and, young, girls, could, be, purchased, the, elder, refugees, in, the, hagia, sophia, were, slaughtered, and, the, women, raped, george, sphrantzes, says, that, people, of, both, genders, were, raped, inside, hagia, sophia, according, to, steven, runciman, most, of, the, elderly, and, the, infirm, wounded, and, sick, who, were, refugees, inside, the, churches, were, killed, and, the, remainder, were, chained, up, and, sold, into, slavery, everywhere, there, was, misfortune, everyone, was, touched, by, pain, when, mehmed, entered, the, city, there, were, lamentations, and, weeping, in, every, house, screaming, in, the, crossroads, and, sorrow, in, all, churches, the, groaning, of, grown, men, and, the, shrieking, of, women, accompanied, looting, enslavement, separation, and, rape, mehmed, entered, the, hagia, sophia, marveling, at, the, sight, of, the, grand, basilica, witnessing, a, ghazi, wildly, hammering, at, the, marble, floor, he, asked, what, he, was, doing, it, is, for, the, faith, the, ghazi, said, mehmed, cut, him, down, with, his, kilij, be, satisfied, with, the, booty, and, the, captives, the, buildings, of, the, city, belong, to, me, during, the, festivities, and, as, he, had, promised, his, viziers, and, his, other, officers, mehmed, had, the, wretched, citizens, of, constantinople, dragged, before, them, and, ordered, many, of, them, to, be, hacked, to, pieces, for, the, sake, of, entertainment, byzantine, historian, doukas, claims, that, while, drunk, during, his, victory, banquet, the, sultan, ordered, the, grand, duke, loukas, notaras, to, give, his, youngest, son, to, him, for, his, pleasure, he, replied, that, it, would, be, far, better, for, me, to, die, than, hand, over, my, own, child, to, be, despoiled, by, him, mehmed, was, enraged, after, hearing, this, and, ordered, loukas, to, be, executed, before, his, death, notaras, supposedly, said, that, him, who, was, crucified, for, us, died, and, arose, and, urged, his, horrified, sons, to, reject, the, advances, of, mehmed, and, not, fear, the, outcome, their, father, s, words, encouraged, them, and, they, also, were, ready, to, die, they, are, also, said, to, have, been, executed, however, american, researcher, and, professor, walter, g, andrew, doubts, the, authenticity, of, this, story, citing, the, similarities, with, the, earlier, story, of, saint, pelagius, he, states, that, it, is, likely, that, doukas, s, tale, owes, more, to, saint, pelagius, and, a, long, history, of, attempts, to, portray, muslims, as, morally, inferior, than, to, anything, that, actually, happened, during, the, conquest, of, constantinople, istanbul, mehmed, ii, granted, his, soldiers, three, days, to, plunder, the, city, as, he, had, promised, them, and, in, accordance, with, the, custom, of, the, time, by, noon, the, city, streets, were, filled, with, blood, the, turks, looted, houses, raped, and, impaled, women, and, children, destroyed, churches, tore, icons, from, their, frames, and, books, from, their, bindings, all, that, remained, of, the, imperial, palace, in, blachernae, were, the, walls, byzantium, s, most, sacred, icon, the, hodegetria, was, cut, into, four, pieces, and, destroyed, the, most, monstrous, events, took, place, in, the, church, of, hagia, sophia, there, the, morning, service, was, already, underway, when, the, parishioners, heard, the, maddened, conquerors, approaching, the, huge, bronze, doors, immediately, slammed, shut, but, soon, the, turks, smashed, them, and, entered, the, temple, the, poorer, and, less, attractive, looking, parishioners, were, killed, on, the, spot, the, rest, were, taken, to, a, turkish, camp, where, they, remained, to, await, the, decision, of, their, fate, soldiers, fought, over, the, possession, of, some, of, the, spoils, of, war, on, the, third, day, of, the, conquest, mehmed, ii, ordered, all, looting, to, stop, and, issued, a, proclamation, that, all, christians, who, had, avoided, capture, or, who, had, been, ransomed, could, return, to, their, homes, without, further, molestation, although, many, had, no, homes, to, return, to, and, many, more, had, been, taken, captive, and, not, ransomed, byzantine, historian, george, sphrantzes, an, eyewitness, to, the, fall, of, constantinople, described, the, sultan, s, actions, on, the, third, day, after, the, fall, of, our, city, the, sultan, celebrated, his, victory, with, a, great, joyful, triumph, he, issued, a, proclamation, the, citizens, of, all, ages, who, had, managed, to, escape, detection, were, to, leave, their, hiding, places, throughout, the, city, and, come, out, into, the, open, as, they, were, to, remain, free, and, no, question, would, be, asked, he, further, declared, the, restoration, of, houses, and, property, to, those, who, had, abandoned, our, city, before, the, siege, if, they, returned, home, they, would, be, treated, according, to, their, rank, and, religion, as, if, nothing, had, changed, mehmed, himself, knocked, over, and, trampled, on, the, altar, of, the, hagia, sophia, he, then, ordered, a, muezzin, to, ascend, the, pulpit, and, sound, a, prayer, the, hagia, sophia, was, converted, into, a, mosque, but, the, greek, orthodox, church, was, allowed, to, remain, intact, and, gennadius, scholarius, was, appointed, patriarch, of, constantinople, this, was, once, thought, to, be, the, origin, of, the, ottoman, millet, system, however, it, is, now, considered, a, myth, and, no, such, system, existed, in, the, fifteenth, century, the, fall, of, constantinople, shocked, many, europeans, who, viewed, it, as, a, catastrophic, event, for, their, civilization, many, feared, other, european, christian, kingdoms, would, suffer, the, same, fate, as, constantinople, two, possible, responses, emerged, amongst, the, humanists, and, churchmen, of, that, era, crusade, or, dialogue, pope, pius, ii, strongly, advocated, for, another, crusade, while, the, german, nicholas, of, cusa, supported, engaging, in, a, dialogue, with, the, ottomans, in, the, past, we, received, our, wounds, in, asia, and, in, africa, in, foreign, countries, this, time, however, we, are, being, attacked, in, europe, in, our, own, land, in, our, own, house, you, will, protest, that, the, turks, moved, from, asia, to, greece, a, long, time, ago, that, the, mongols, established, themselves, in, europe, and, the, arabs, occupied, parts, of, spain, having, approached, through, the, straits, of, gibraltar, we, have, never, lost, a, city, or, a, place, comparable, to, constantinople, the, morean, peloponnesian, fortress, of, mystras, where, constantine, s, brothers, thomas, and, demetrius, ruled, constantly, in, conflict, with, each, other, and, knowing, that, mehmed, would, eventually, invade, them, as, well, held, out, until, 1460, long, before, the, fall, of, constantinople, demetrius, had, fought, for, the, throne, with, thomas, constantine, and, their, other, brothers, john, and, theodore, thomas, escaped, to, rome, when, the, ottomans, invaded, morea, while, demetrius, expected, to, rule, a, puppet, state, but, instead, was, imprisoned, and, remained, there, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, rome, thomas, and, his, family, received, some, monetary, support, from, the, pope, and, other, western, rulers, as, byzantine, emperor, in, exile, until, 1503, in, 1461, the, independent, byzantine, state, in, trebizond, fell, to, mehmed, constantine, xi, had, died, without, producing, an, heir, and, had, constantinople, not, fallen, he, likely, would, have, been, succeeded, by, the, sons, of, his, deceased, elder, brother, who, were, taken, into, the, palace, service, of, mehmed, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, the, oldest, boy, renamed, murad, became, a, personal, favourite, of, mehmed, and, served, as, beylerbey, governor, general, of, rumeli, the, balkans, the, younger, son, renamed, mesih, pasha, became, admiral, of, the, ottoman, fleet, and, sancak, beg, governor, of, the, province, of, gallipoli, he, eventually, served, twice, as, grand, vizier, under, mehmed, s, son, bayezid, ii, with, the, capture, of, constantinople, mehmed, ii, had, acquired, the, future, capital, of, his, kingdom, albeit, one, in, decline, due, to, years, of, war, the, loss, of, the, city, was, a, crippling, blow, to, christendom, and, it, exposed, the, christian, west, to, a, vigorous, and, aggressive, foe, in, the, east, the, christian, reconquest, of, constantinople, remained, a, goal, in, western, europe, for, many, years, after, its, fall, to, the, ottoman, empire, rumours, of, constantine, xi, s, survival, and, subsequent, rescue, by, an, angel, led, many, to, hope, that, the, city, would, one, day, return, to, christian, hands, pope, nicholas, v, called, for, an, immediate, counter, attack, in, the, form, of, a, crusade, however, no, european, powers, wished, to, participate, and, the, pope, resorted, to, sending, a, small, fleet, of, 10, ships, to, defend, the, city, the, short, lived, crusade, immediately, came, to, an, end, and, as, western, europe, entered, the, 16th, century, the, age, of, crusading, began, to, come, to, an, end, for, some, time, greek, scholars, had, gone, to, italian, city, states, a, cultural, exchange, begun, in, 1396, by, coluccio, salutati, chancellor, of, florence, who, had, invited, manuel, chrysoloras, to, lecture, at, the, university, of, florence, after, the, conquest, many, greeks, such, as, john, argyropoulos, and, constantine, lascaris, fled, the, city, and, found, refuge, in, the, latin, west, bringing, with, them, knowledge, and, documents, from, the, greco, roman, tradition, to, italy, and, other, regions, that, further, propelled, the, renaissance, those, greeks, who, stayed, behind, in, constantinople, mostly, lived, in, the, phanar, and, galata, districts, of, the, city, the, phanariotes, as, they, were, called, provided, many, capable, advisers, to, the, ottoman, rulers, a, severed, head, that, was, claimed, to, belong, to, byzantine, emperor, constantine, xi, palaiologos, was, found, and, presented, to, mehmed, and, nailed, onto, a, column, while, standing, before, the, head, the, sultan, in, his, speech, said, fellow, soldiers, this, one, thing, was, lacking, to, make, the, glory, of, such, a, victory, complete, now, at, this, happy, and, joyful, moment, of, time, we, have, the, riches, of, the, greeks, we, have, won, their, empire, and, their, religion, is, completely, extinguished, our, ancestors, eagerly, desired, to, achieve, this, rejoice, now, since, it, is, your, bravery, which, has, won, this, kingdom, for, us, the, news, spread, rapidly, across, the, islamic, world, in, egypt, good, tidings, were, proclaimed, and, cairo, decorated, to, celebrate, this, greatest, of, conquests, the, sharif, of, mecca, wrote, to, mehmed, calling, the, sultan, the, one, who, has, aided, islam, and, the, muslims, the, sultan, of, all, kings, and, sultans, the, fact, that, constantinople, which, was, long, known, for, being, indomitable, in, the, eyes, of, all, as, the, sharif, of, mecca, said, had, fallen, and, that, the, prophet, muhammad, s, prophecy, came, true, shocked, the, islamic, world, and, filled, it, with, a, great, jubilation, and, rapture, byzantium, is, a, term, used, by, modern, historians, to, refer, to, the, later, roman, empire, in, its, own, time, the, empire, ruled, from, constantinople, or, new, rome, as, some, people, call, it, although, this, was, a, laudatory, expression, that, was, never, an, official, title, and, was, simply, considered, as, the, roman, empire, the, fall, of, constantinople, led, competing, factions, to, lay, claim, to, being, the, inheritors, of, the, imperial, mantle, russian, claims, to, byzantine, heritage, clashed, with, those, of, the, ottoman, empire, s, own, claim, in, mehmed, s, view, he, was, the, successor, to, the, roman, emperor, declaring, himself, kayser, i, rum, literally, caesar, of, the, romans, that, is, of, the, roman, empire, though, he, was, remembered, as, the, conqueror, stefan, du, an, tsar, of, serbia, and, ivan, alexander, tsar, of, bulgaria, both, made, similar, claims, regarding, themselves, as, legitimate, heirs, to, the, roman, empire, other, potential, claimants, such, as, the, republic, of, venice, and, the, holy, roman, empire, have, disintegrated, into, history, pope, pius, ii, believed, that, the, ottomans, would, persecute, greek, orthodox, christians, and, advocated, for, another, crusade, at, the, council, of, mantua, in, 1459, there, are, many, legends, in, greece, surrounding, the, fall, of, constantinople, it, was, said, that, the, partial, lunar, eclipse, that, occurred, on, 22, may, 1453, represented, a, fulfilment, of, a, prophecy, of, the, city, s, demise, four, days, later, the, whole, city, was, blotted, out, by, a, thick, fog, a, condition, unknown, in, that, part, of, the, world, in, may, when, the, fog, lifted, that, evening, a, strange, light, was, seen, playing, about, the, dome, of, the, hagia, sophia, which, some, interpreted, as, the, holy, spirit, departing, from, the, city, this, evidently, indicated, the, departure, of, the, divine, presence, and, its, leaving, the, city, in, total, abandonment, and, desertion, for, the, divinity, conceals, itself, in, cloud, and, appears, and, again, disappears, for, others, there, was, still, a, distant, hope, that, the, lights, were, the, campfires, of, the, troops, of, john, hunyadi, who, had, come, to, relieve, the, city, it, is, possible, that, all, these, phenomena, were, local, effects, of, the, cataclysmic, 1452, 1453, mystery, eruption, which, occurred, around, the, time, of, the, siege, the, fire, seen, may, have, been, an, optical, illusion, due, to, the, reflection, of, intensely, red, twilight, glow, by, clouds, of, volcanic, ash, high, in, the, atmosphere, another, legend, holds, that, two, priests, saying, divine, liturgy, over, the, crowd, disappeared, into, the, cathedral, s, walls, as, the, first, turkish, soldiers, entered, according, to, the, legend, the, priests, will, appear, again, on, the, day, that, constantinople, returns, to, christian, hands, another, legend, refers, to, the, marble, emperor, constantine, xi, holding, that, an, angel, rescued, the, emperor, when, the, ottomans, entered, the, city, turning, him, into, marble, and, placing, him, in, a, cave, under, the, earth, near, the, golden, gate, where, he, waits, to, be, brought, to, life, again, a, variant, of, the, sleeping, hero, legend, however, many, of, the, myths, surrounding, the, disappearance, of, constantine, were, developed, later, and, little, evidence, can, be, found, to, support, them, even, in, friendly, primary, accounts, of, the, siege, guillaume, dufay, composed, several, songs, lamenting, the, fall, of, the, eastern, church, and, the, duke, of, burgundy, philip, the, good, avowed, to, take, up, arms, against, the, turks, however, as, the, growing, ottoman, power, from, this, date, on, coincided, with, the, protestant, reformation, and, subsequent, counter, reformation, the, recapture, of, constantinople, became, an, ever, distant, dream, even, france, once, a, fervent, participant, in, the, crusades, became, an, ally, of, the, ottomans, nonetheless, depictions, of,

constantinople, and, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, is, considered, by, many, scholars, key, to, the, revival, of, greek, and, roman, studies, that, led, to, the, development, of, the, renaissance, humanism, and, science, these, migr, s, were, grammarians, humanists, poets, writers, printers, lecturers, musicians, astronomers, architects, academics, artists, scribes, philosophers,
