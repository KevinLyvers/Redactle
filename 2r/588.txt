troubles, in, britain, and, europe, the, troubles, irish, na, triobl, id, were, an, ethno, nationalist, conflict, in, northern, ireland, that, lasted, for, about, 30, years, from, the, late, 1960s, to, 1998, also, known, internationally, as, the, northern, ireland, conflict, it, is, sometimes, described, as, an, irregular, war, or, low, level, war, the, conflict, began, in, the, late, 1960s, and, is, usually, deemed, to, have, ended, with, the, good, friday, agreement, of, 1998, although, the, troubles, mostly, took, place, in, northern, ireland, at, times, violence, spilled, over, into, parts, of, the, republic, of, ireland, england, and, mainland, europe, the, conflict, was, primarily, political, and, nationalistic, being, fuelled, by, historical, events, it, also, had, an, ethnic, or, sectarian, dimension, but, despite, use, of, the, terms, protestant, and, catholic, to, refer, to, the, two, sides, it, was, not, a, religious, conflict, a, key, issue, was, the, status, of, northern, ireland, unionists, and, loyalists, who, for, historical, reasons, were, mostly, ulster, protestants, wanted, northern, ireland, to, remain, within, the, united, kingdom, irish, nationalists, and, republicans, who, were, mostly, irish, catholics, wanted, northern, ireland, to, leave, the, united, kingdom, and, join, a, united, ireland, the, conflict, began, during, a, campaign, by, the, northern, ireland, civil, rights, association, to, end, discrimination, against, the, catholic, nationalist, minority, by, the, protestant, unionist, government, and, local, authorities, the, government, attempted, to, suppress, the, protests, the, police, the, royal, ulster, constabulary, ruc, were, overwhelmingly, protestant, and, known, for, sectarianism, and, police, brutality, the, campaign, was, also, violently, opposed, by, ulster, loyalists, who, believed, it, was, a, front, for, republican, political, activity, increasing, tensions, led, to, the, august, 1969, riots, and, the, deployment, of, british, troops, in, what, became, the, british, army, s, longest, operation, peace, walls, were, built, in, some, areas, to, keep, the, two, communities, apart, some, catholics, initially, welcomed, the, british, army, as, a, more, neutral, force, than, the, ruc, but, soon, came, to, see, it, as, hostile, and, biased, particularly, after, bloody, sunday, in, 1972, the, main, participants, in, the, troubles, were, republican, paramilitaries, such, as, the, provisional, irish, republican, army, ira, and, the, irish, national, liberation, army, inla, loyalist, paramilitaries, such, as, the, ulster, volunteer, force, uvf, and, ulster, defence, association, uda, british, state, security, forces, such, as, the, british, army, and, ruc, and, political, activists, the, security, forces, of, the, republic, of, ireland, played, a, smaller, role, republicans, carried, out, a, guerrilla, campaign, against, british, forces, as, well, as, a, bombing, campaign, against, infrastructural, commercial, and, political, targets, loyalists, attacked, republicans, nationalists, and, the, wider, catholic, community, in, what, they, described, as, retaliation, at, times, there, were, bouts, of, sectarian, tit, for, tat, violence, as, well, as, feuds, within, and, between, paramilitary, groups, the, british, security, forces, undertook, policing, and, counterinsurgency, primarily, against, republicans, there, were, incidents, of, collusion, between, british, state, forces, and, loyalist, paramilitaries, see, stevens, inquiries, the, troubles, also, involved, numerous, riots, mass, protests, and, acts, of, civil, disobedience, and, led, to, increased, segregation, and, the, creation, of, temporary, no, go, areas, more, than, 3, 500, people, were, killed, in, the, conflict, of, whom, 52, were, civilians, 32, were, members, of, the, british, security, forces, and, 16, were, members, of, paramilitary, groups, republican, paramilitaries, were, responsible, for, some, 60, of, the, deaths, loyalists, 30, and, security, forces, 10, loyalists, were, responsible, for, 48, of, the, civilian, casualties, republicans, 39, and, the, security, forces, 10, the, northern, ireland, peace, process, led, to, paramilitary, ceasefires, and, talks, between, the, main, political, parties, which, resulted, in, the, good, friday, agreement, of, 1998, this, agreement, restored, self, government, to, northern, ireland, on, the, basis, of, power, sharing, and, it, included, acceptance, of, the, principle, of, consent, commitment, to, civil, and, political, rights, parity, of, esteem, police, reform, paramilitary, disarmament, and, early, release, of, paramilitary, prisoners, there, has, been, sporadic, violence, since, the, agreement, including, punishment, attacks, loyalist, gangs, control, of, major, organised, crime, rackets, e, g, drugs, supply, community, coercion, and, violence, intimidation, and, violent, crime, linked, to, dissident, republican, groups, the, word, troubles, has, been, used, as, a, synonym, for, violent, conflict, for, centuries, it, was, used, to, describe, the, 17th, century, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, by, all, three, national, parliaments, for, example, after, the, restoration, in, 1660, the, english, act, of, free, and, general, pardon, indemnity, and, oblivion, starts, with, the, king, s, most, excellent, majesty, taking, into, his, gracious, and, serious, consideration, the, long, and, great, troubles, as, does, the, similar, act, in, scotland, the, king, s, most, excellent, majesty, considering, that, by, the, late, troubles, diverse, of, his, subjects, scottish, parliament, 1662, and, by, the, irish, parliament, in, the, act, of, explanation, 1665, our, royal, father, of, blessed, memory, had, been, forced, during, the, late, troubles, to, make, with, the, irish, subjects, of, that, our, kingdom, irish, parliament, 1665, 2, the, term, was, used, to, describe, the, irish, revolutionary, period, in, the, early, twentieth, century, it, was, subsequently, adopted, to, refer, to, the, escalating, violence, in, northern, ireland, after, 1969, in, 1609, scottish, and, english, settlers, known, as, planters, were, given, land, escheated, from, the, native, irish, in, the, plantation, of, ulster, coupled, with, protestant, immigration, to, unplanted, areas, of, ulster, particularly, antrim, and, down, this, resulted, in, conflict, between, the, native, catholics, and, the, planters, leading, in, turn, to, two, bloody, religious, conflicts, known, as, the, irish, confederate, wars, 1641, 1653, and, the, williamite, war, 1689, 1691, both, of, which, resulted, in, protestant, victories, anglican, dominance, in, ireland, was, ensured, by, the, passage, of, the, penal, laws, that, curtailed, the, religious, legal, and, political, rights, of, anyone, including, both, catholics, and, protestant, dissenters, such, as, presbyterians, who, did, not, conform, to, the, state, church, the, anglican, church, of, ireland, as, the, penal, laws, started, to, be, phased, out, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 18th, century, there, was, more, competition, for, land, as, restrictions, were, lifted, on, the, irish, catholic, ability, to, rent, with, irish, catholics, allowed, to, buy, land, and, enter, trades, from, which, they, had, formerly, been, banned, tensions, arose, resulting, in, the, protestant, peep, o, day, boys, and, catholic, defenders, this, created, polarisation, between, the, communities, and, a, dramatic, reduction, in, reformers, among, protestants, many, of, whom, had, been, growing, more, receptive, to, democratic, reform, following, the, foundation, of, the, republican, society, of, the, united, irishmen, by, presbyterians, catholics, and, liberal, anglicans, and, the, resulting, failed, irish, rebellion, of, 1798, sectarian, violence, between, catholics, and, protestants, continued, the, orange, order, founded, 1795, with, its, stated, goal, of, upholding, the, protestant, faith, and, loyalty, to, the, heirs, of, william, of, orange, dates, from, this, period, and, remains, active, to, this, day, with, the, acts, of, union, 1800, which, came, into, force, on, 1, january, 1801, a, new, political, framework, was, formed, with, the, abolition, of, the, irish, parliament, and, incorporation, of, ireland, into, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, the, result, was, a, closer, tie, between, anglicans, and, the, formerly, republican, presbyterians, as, part, of, a, loyal, protestant, community, although, catholic, emancipation, was, achieved, in, 1829, largely, eliminating, official, discrimination, against, roman, catholics, then, around, 75, of, ireland, s, population, dissenters, and, jews, the, repeal, association, s, campaign, to, repeal, the, 1801, union, failed, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, home, rule, movement, was, created, and, served, to, define, the, divide, between, most, nationalists, usually, catholics, who, sought, the, restoration, of, an, irish, parliament, and, most, unionists, usually, protestants, who, were, afraid, of, being, a, minority, under, a, catholic, dominated, irish, parliament, and, who, tended, to, support, continuing, union, with, great, britain, unionists, and, home, rule, advocates, were, the, main, political, factions, in, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, ireland, by, the, second, decade, of, the, 20th, century, home, rule, or, limited, irish, self, government, was, on, the, brink, of, being, conceded, due, to, the, agitation, of, the, irish, parliamentary, party, in, response, to, the, campaign, for, home, rule, which, started, in, the, 1870s, unionists, mostly, protestant, and, largely, concentrated, in, ulster, had, resisted, both, self, government, and, independence, for, ireland, fearing, for, their, future, in, an, overwhelmingly, catholic, country, dominated, by, the, roman, catholic, church, in, 1912, unionists, led, by, edward, carson, signed, the, ulster, covenant, and, pledged, to, resist, home, rule, by, force, if, necessary, to, this, end, they, formed, the, paramilitary, ulster, volunteer, force, uvf, in, response, nationalists, led, by, eoin, macneill, formed, the, irish, volunteers, in, 1913, whose, goal, was, to, oppose, the, uvf, and, ensure, enactment, of, the, third, home, rule, bill, in, the, event, of, british, or, unionist, refusal, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1914, and, ireland, s, involvement, in, the, war, temporarily, averted, possible, civil, war, in, ireland, and, delayed, the, resolution, of, the, question, of, irish, independence, home, rule, although, passed, in, the, british, parliament, with, royal, assent, was, suspended, for, the, duration, of, the, war, the, irish, volunteers, split, with, a, majority, known, as, the, national, volunteers, supporting, the, war, effort, and, some, of, them, joining, irish, regiments, of, the, new, british, army, many, of, those, who, stayed, were, radical, nationalists, among, them, irish, republican, brotherhood, infiltrators, from, these, ranks, came, those, who, launched, the, easter, rising, in, dublin, in, 1916, led, by, patrick, pearse, and, james, connolly, two, and, a, half, years, after, the, executions, of, sixteen, of, the, rising, s, leaders, the, separatist, sinn, f, in, party, won, the, december, 1918, general, election, in, ireland, with, 47, of, the, vote, and, a, majority, of, seats, and, set, up, the, 1919, first, d, il, irish, parliament, in, dublin, their, victory, was, aided, by, the, threat, of, conscription, for, first, world, war, service, the, irish, war, for, independence, followed, leading, to, eventual, independence, in, 1922, for, the, irish, free, state, which, comprised, 26, of, the, 32, irish, counties, in, ulster, particularly, in, the, six, counties, which, became, northern, ireland, sinn, f, in, fared, relatively, poorly, in, the, 1918, election, and, unionists, won, a, majority, the, government, of, ireland, act, 1920, partitioned, the, island, of, ireland, into, two, separate, jurisdictions, southern, ireland, and, northern, ireland, both, devolved, regions, of, the, united, kingdom, this, partition, of, ireland, was, confirmed, when, the, parliament, of, northern, ireland, exercised, its, right, in, december, 1922, under, the, anglo, irish, treaty, of, 1921, to, opt, out, of, the, newly, established, irish, free, state, a, part, of, the, treaty, signed, in, 1922, mandated, that, a, boundary, commission, would, sit, to, decide, where, the, frontier, of, the, northern, state, would, be, in, relation, to, its, southern, neighbour, after, the, irish, civil, war, of, 1922, 1923, this, part, of, the, treaty, was, given, less, priority, by, the, new, dublin, government, led, by, w, t, cosgrave, and, was, quietly, dropped, as, counties, fermanagh, and, tyrone, and, border, areas, of, londonderry, armagh, and, down, were, mainly, nationalist, the, irish, boundary, commission, could, reduce, northern, ireland, to, four, counties, or, fewer, in, october, 1922, the, irish, free, state, government, established, the, north, eastern, boundary, bureau, a, government, office, which, by, 1925, had, prepared, 56, boxes, of, files, to, argue, its, case, for, large, areas, of, northern, ireland, to, be, transferred, to, the, free, state, northern, ireland, remained, a, part, of, the, united, kingdom, albeit, under, a, separate, system, of, government, whereby, it, was, given, its, own, parliament, and, devolved, government, while, this, arrangement, met, the, desires, of, unionists, to, remain, part, of, the, united, kingdom, nationalists, largely, viewed, the, partition, of, ireland, as, an, illegal, and, arbitrary, division, of, the, island, against, the, will, of, the, majority, of, its, people, they, argued, that, the, northern, ireland, state, was, neither, legitimate, nor, democratic, but, created, with, a, deliberately, gerrymandered, unionist, majority, catholics, initially, composed, about, 35, of, its, population, a, total, of, 557, people, mostly, catholics, were, killed, in, political, or, sectarian, violence, from, 1920, to, 1922, in, the, six, counties, that, would, become, northern, ireland, both, during, and, after, the, irish, war, of, independence, the, result, was, communal, strife, between, catholics, and, protestants, with, some, historians, describing, this, violence, especially, that, in, belfast, as, a, pogrom, although, historian, peter, hart, argues, that, the, term, is, not, appropriate, given, the, reciprocity, of, violence, in, northern, ireland, see, the, troubles, in, ulster, 1920, 1922, and, bloody, sunday, 1921, a, marginalised, remnant, of, the, irish, republican, army, survived, the, irish, civil, war, this, would, come, to, have, a, major, impact, on, northern, ireland, although, the, ira, was, proscribed, on, both, sides, of, the, new, irish, border, it, remained, ideologically, committed, to, overthrowing, both, the, northern, ireland, and, the, free, state, governments, by, force, of, arms, to, unify, ireland, the, government, of, northern, ireland, passed, the, special, powers, act, in, 1922, giving, sweeping, powers, to, the, government, and, police, to, intern, suspects, without, trial, and, to, administer, corporal, punishment, such, as, flogging, to, re, establish, or, preserve, law, and, order, the, act, continued, to, be, used, against, nationalists, long, after, the, violence, of, this, period, had, come, to, an, end, various, unionist, militias, were, also, incorporated, into, state, structures, including, the, ulster, special, constabulary, which, allen, feldman, argues, emulated, the, state, s, fusion, of, repressive, and, ideological, apparatuses, in, 1920, in, local, elections, held, under, proportional, representation, nationalists, had, won, control, over, many, local, governments, including, the, county, councils, of, fermanagh, and, tyrone, and, the, londonderry, borough, council, governing, derry, city, in, response, in, 1922, the, new, unionist, government, re, drew, the, electoral, boundaries, to, give, its, supporters, a, disproportionate, majority, and, abolished, proportional, representation, in, favour, of, first, past, the, post, voting, this, resulted, in, control, by, unionists, of, areas, such, as, derry, city, fermanagh, and, tyrone, where, they, were, actually, a, minority, of, voters, the, two, sides, positions, became, strictly, defined, following, this, period, from, a, unionist, perspective, northern, ireland, s, nationalists, were, inherently, disloyal, and, determined, to, force, unionists, into, a, united, ireland, this, threat, was, seen, as, justifying, preferential, treatment, of, unionists, in, housing, employment, and, other, fields, the, prevalence, of, larger, families, and, thus, the, potential, for, a, more, rapid, population, growth, among, catholics, was, seen, as, a, threat, unionist, governments, ignored, edward, carson, s, warning, in, 1921, that, alienating, catholics, would, make, northern, ireland, inherently, unstable, after, the, early, 1920s, there, were, occasional, incidents, of, sectarian, unrest, in, northern, ireland, these, included, severe, rioting, in, belfast, in, the, 1930s, and, 1950s, and, the, ira, s, brief, northern, campaign, in, the, 1940s, and, border, campaign, between, 1956, and, 1962, which, did, not, enjoy, broad, popular, support, among, nationalists, after, the, ira, called, off, its, campaign, in, 1962, northern, ireland, became, relatively, stable, for, a, few, years, there, is, little, agreement, on, the, exact, date, of, the, start, of, the, troubles, different, writers, have, suggested, different, dates, these, include, the, formation, of, the, modern, ulster, volunteer, force, in, 1966, the, civil, rights, march, in, derry, on, 5, october, 1968, the, beginning, of, the, battle, of, the, bogside, on, 12, august, 1969, or, the, deployment, of, british, troops, on, 14, august, 1969, the, northern, ireland, troubles, legacy, and, reconciliation, act, 2023, passed, by, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, defined, the, start, of, the, troubles, as, 1, january, 1966, for, the, purposes, of, the, act, in, march, and, april, 1966, irish, nationalists, republicans, held, parades, throughout, ireland, to, mark, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, easter, rising, on, 8, march, a, group, of, irish, republicans, dynamited, nelson, s, pillar, in, dublin, at, the, time, the, ira, was, weak, and, not, engaged, in, armed, action, but, some, unionists, warned, it, was, about, to, be, revived, to, launch, another, campaign, against, northern, ireland, in, april, 1966, loyalists, led, by, ian, paisley, a, protestant, fundamentalist, preacher, founded, the, ulster, constitution, defence, committee, ucdc, it, set, up, a, paramilitary, style, wing, called, the, ulster, protestant, volunteers, upv, to, oust, terence, o, neill, prime, minister, of, northern, ireland, although, o, neill, was, a, unionist, they, viewed, him, as, being, too, soft, on, the, civil, rights, movement, and, opposed, his, policies, at, the, same, time, a, loyalist, group, calling, itself, the, ulster, volunteer, force, uvf, emerged, in, the, shankill, area, of, belfast, it, was, led, by, gusty, spence, a, former, british, soldier, many, of, its, members, were, also, members, of, the, ucdc, and, upv, in, april, and, may, 1966, the, uvf, petrol, bombed, a, number, of, catholic, homes, schools, and, businesses, a, firebomb, killed, an, elderly, protestant, widow, matilda, gould, on, 21, may, the, uvf, issued, a, statement, declaring, war, against, the, ira, and, anyone, helping, it, the, uvf, fatally, shot, a, catholic, civilian, john, scullion, as, he, walked, home, on, 27, may, a, month, later, it, shot, three, catholic, civilians, as, they, left, a, pub, killing, peter, ward, a, catholic, from, the, falls, road, shortly, after, the, uvf, was, proscribed, by, the, northern, ireland, government, the, uvf, is, still, considered, a, terrorist, organization, by, the, united, kingdom, and, the, republic, of, ireland, in, the, mid, 1960s, a, non, violent, civil, rights, campaign, began, in, northern, ireland, it, comprised, groups, such, as, the, northern, ireland, civil, rights, association, nicra, the, campaign, for, social, justice, the, derry, citizens, action, committee, and, people, s, democracy, whose, stated, goals, were, some, suspected, and, accused, nicra, of, being, a, republican, front, group, whose, ultimate, goal, was, to, unite, ireland, although, republicans, and, some, members, of, the, ira, then, led, by, cathal, goulding, and, pursuing, a, non, violent, agenda, helped, to, create, and, drive, the, movement, they, did, not, control, it, and, were, not, a, dominant, faction, within, it, on, 20, june, 1968, civil, rights, activists, including, nationalist, member, of, parliament, mp, austin, currie, protested, against, housing, discrimination, by, squatting, in, a, house, in, caledon, county, tyrone, the, local, council, had, allocated, the, house, to, an, unmarried, 19, year, old, protestant, emily, beattie, the, secretary, of, a, local, uup, politician, instead, of, either, of, two, large, catholic, families, with, children, ruc, officers, one, of, whom, was, beattie, s, brother, forcibly, removed, the, activists, two, days, before, the, protest, the, two, catholic, families, who, had, been, squatting, in, the, house, next, door, were, removed, by, police, currie, had, brought, their, grievance, to, the, local, council, and, to, stormont, but, had, been, told, to, leave, the, incident, invigorated, the, civil, rights, movement, on, 24, august, 1968, the, civil, rights, movement, held, its, first, civil, rights, march, from, coalisland, to, dungannon, many, more, marches, were, held, over, the, following, year, loyalists, especially, members, of, the, upv, attacked, some, of, the, marches, and, held, counter, demonstrations, in, a, bid, to, get, the, marches, banned, because, of, the, lack, of, police, reaction, to, the, attacks, nationalists, saw, the, ruc, which, was, almost, wholly, protestant, as, backing, the, loyalists, and, allowing, the, attacks, to, occur, on, 5, october, 1968, a, civil, rights, march, in, derry, was, banned, by, the, northern, ireland, government, when, marchers, defied, the, ban, ruc, officers, surrounded, the, marchers, and, beat, them, indiscriminately, and, without, provocation, more, than, 100, people, were, injured, including, a, number, of, nationalist, politicians, the, incident, was, filmed, by, television, news, crews, and, shown, around, the, world, it, caused, outrage, among, catholics, and, nationalists, sparking, two, days, of, rioting, in, derry, between, nationalists, and, the, ruc, a, few, days, later, a, student, civil, rights, group, people, s, democracy, was, formed, in, belfast, in, late, november, o, neill, promised, the, civil, rights, movement, some, concessions, but, these, were, seen, as, too, little, by, nationalists, and, too, much, by, loyalists, on, 1, january, 1969, people, s, democracy, began, a, four, day, march, from, belfast, to, derry, which, was, repeatedly, harassed, and, attacked, by, loyalists, at, burntollet, bridge, the, marchers, were, attacked, by, about, 200, loyalists, including, some, off, duty, police, officers, armed, with, iron, bars, bricks, and, bottles, in, a, planned, ambush, when, the, march, reached, derry, city, it, was, again, attacked, the, marchers, claimed, that, police, did, nothing, to, protect, them, and, that, some, officers, helped, the, attackers, that, night, ruc, officers, went, on, a, rampage, in, the, bogside, area, of, derry, attacking, catholic, homes, attacking, and, threatening, residents, and, hurling, sectarian, abuse, residents, then, sealed, off, the, bogside, with, barricades, to, keep, the, police, out, creating, free, derry, which, was, briefly, a, no, go, area, for, the, security, forces, in, march, and, april, 1969, loyalists, bombed, water, and, electricity, installations, in, northern, ireland, blaming, them, on, the, dormant, ira, and, elements, of, the, civil, rights, movement, some, attacks, left, much, of, belfast, without, power, and, water, loyalists, hoped, the, bombings, would, force, o, neill, to, resign, and, bring, an, end, to, any, concessions, to, nationalists, there, were, six, bombings, between, 30, march, and, 26, april, all, were, widely, blamed, on, the, ira, and, british, soldiers, were, sent, to, guard, installations, unionist, support, for, o, neill, waned, and, on, 28, april, he, resigned, as, prime, minister, on, 19, april, there, were, clashes, between, nicra, marchers, the, ruc,

stormont, castle, and, decided, that, a, peace, line, was, to, be, established, to, separate, physically, the, falls, and, the, shankill, communities, initially, this, would, take, the, form, of, a, temporary, barbed, wire, fence, which, would, be, manned, by, the, army, and, the, police, it, was, agreed, that, there, should, be, no, question, of, the, peace, line, becoming, permanent, although, it, was, acknowledged, that, the, barriers, might, have, to, be, strengthened, in, some, locations, on, 10, september, the, british, army, started, construction, of, the, first, peace, wall, it, was, the, first, of, many, such, walls, across, northern, ireland, and, still, stands, today, after, the, riots, the, hunt, committee, was, set, up, to, examine, the, ruc, it, published, its, report, on, 12, october, recommending, that, the, ruc, become, an, unarmed, force, and, the, b, specials, be, disbanded, that, night, loyalists, took, to, the, streets, of, belfast, in, protest, at, the, report, during, violence, in, the, shankill, uvf, members, shot, dead, ruc, officer, victor, arbuckle, he, was, the, first, ruc, officer, to, be, killed, during, the, troubles, in, october, and, december, 1969, the, uvf, carried, out, a, number, of, small, bombings, in, the, republic, of, ireland, despite, the, british, government, s, attempt, to, do, nothing, that, would, suggest, partiality, to, one, section, of, the, community, and, the, improvement, of, the, relationship, between, the, army, and, the, local, population, following, the, army, assistance, with, flood, relief, in, august, 1970, the, falls, curfew, and, a, situation, that, was, described, at, the, time, as, an, inflamed, sectarian, one, which, is, being, deliberately, exploited, by, the, ira, and, other, extremists, meant, that, relations, between, the, catholic, population, and, the, british, army, rapidly, deteriorated, from, 1970, to, 1972, an, explosion, of, political, violence, occurred, in, northern, ireland, the, deadliest, attack, in, the, early, 1970s, was, the, mcgurk, s, bar, bombing, by, the, uvf, in, 1971, the, violence, peaked, in, 1972, when, nearly, 500, people, just, over, half, of, them, civilians, were, killed, the, worst, year, in, the, entire, conflict, by, the, end, of, 1971, 29, barricades, were, in, place, in, derry, blocking, access, to, what, was, known, as, free, derry, 16, of, these, were, impassable, even, to, the, british, army, s, one, ton, armoured, vehicles, many, of, the, nationalist, or, republican, no, go, areas, were, controlled, by, one, of, the, two, factions, of, the, irish, republican, army, the, provisional, ira, and, official, ira, there, are, several, reasons, offered, for, why, violence, escalated, in, these, years, unionists, say, the, main, reason, was, the, formation, of, the, provisional, ira, and, official, ira, particularly, the, former, these, two, groups, were, formed, when, the, ira, split, into, the, provisional, and, official, factions, while, the, older, ira, had, embraced, non, violent, civil, agitation, the, new, provisional, ira, was, determined, to, wage, armed, struggle, against, british, rule, in, northern, ireland, the, new, ira, was, willing, to, take, on, the, role, of, defenders, of, the, catholic, community, rather, than, seeking, working, class, ecumenical, unity, across, both, communities, nationalists, point, to, a, number, of, events, in, these, years, to, explain, the, upsurge, in, violence, one, such, incident, was, the, falls, curfew, in, july, 1970, when, 3, 000, troops, imposed, a, curfew, on, the, nationalist, lower, falls, area, of, belfast, firing, more, than, 1, 500, rounds, of, ammunition, in, gun, battles, with, the, official, ira, and, killing, four, people, another, was, the, introduction, of, internment, without, trial, in, 1971, of, 350, initial, detainees, none, were, protestants, moreover, due, to, poor, intelligence, very, few, of, those, interned, were, actually, republican, activists, at, the, time, but, some, internees, became, increasingly, radicalised, as, a, result, of, their, experiences, in, august, 1971, ten, civilians, were, shot, dead, in, the, ballymurphy, massacre, in, belfast, they, were, innocent, and, the, killings, were, unjustified, according, to, a, 2021, coroner, s, inquest, nine, victims, were, shot, by, the, british, army, bloody, sunday, was, the, shooting, dead, of, thirteen, unarmed, men, by, the, british, army, at, a, proscribed, anti, internment, rally, in, derry, on, 30, january, 1972, a, fourteenth, man, died, of, his, injuries, some, months, later, while, fifteen, other, civilians, were, wounded, the, march, had, been, organised, by, the, northern, ireland, civil, rights, association, nicra, the, soldiers, involved, were, members, of, the, 1st, battalion, parachute, regiment, also, known, as, 1, para, this, was, one, of, the, most, prominent, events, that, occurred, during, the, troubles, as, it, was, recorded, as, the, largest, number, of, civilians, killed, in, a, single, shooting, incident, bloody, sunday, greatly, increased, the, hostility, of, catholics, and, irish, nationalists, towards, the, british, military, and, government, while, significantly, elevating, tensions, as, a, result, the, provisional, ira, gained, more, support, especially, through, rising, numbers, of, recruits, in, the, local, areas, following, the, introduction, of, internment, there, were, numerous, gun, battles, between, the, british, army, and, both, the, provisional, and, official, ira, these, included, the, battle, at, springmartin, and, the, battle, of, lenadoon, between, 1971, and, 1975, 1, 981, people, were, interned, 1, 874, were, catholic, republican, and, 107, were, protestant, loyalist, there, were, widespread, allegations, of, abuse, and, even, torture, of, detainees, and, in, 1972, the, five, techniques, used, by, the, police, and, army, for, interrogation, were, ruled, to, be, illegal, following, a, british, government, inquiry, the, provisional, ira, or, provos, as, they, became, known, sought, to, establish, themselves, as, the, defender, of, the, nationalist, community, the, official, ira, oira, began, its, own, armed, campaign, in, reaction, to, the, ongoing, violence, the, provisional, ira, s, offensive, campaign, began, in, early, 1971, when, the, army, council, sanctioned, attacks, on, the, british, army, in, 1972, the, provisional, ira, killed, approximately, 100, members, of, the, security, forces, wounded, 500, others, and, carried, out, approximately, 1, 300, bombings, mostly, against, commercial, targets, which, they, considered, the, artificial, economy, their, bombing, campaign, killed, many, civilians, notably, on, bloody, friday, on, 21, july, when, they, set, off, 22, bombs, in, the, centre, of, belfast, killing, five, civilians, two, british, soldiers, a, royal, ulster, constabulary, ruc, reservist, and, an, ulster, defence, association, uda, member, ten, days, later, nine, civilians, were, killed, in, a, triple, car, bombing, in, claudy, the, ira, is, accused, of, committing, this, bombing, but, no, proof, for, that, accusation, is, yet, published, in, 1972, the, official, ira, s, campaign, was, largely, counter, productive, the, aldershot, bombing, an, attack, on, the, barracks, of, the, parachute, regiment, in, retaliation, for, bloody, sunday, killed, five, female, cleaners, a, gardener, and, an, army, chaplain, the, official, ira, killed, three, soldiers, in, derry, in, april, but, joe, mccann, was, killed, by, the, parachute, regiment, in, belfast, during, the, same, month, the, official, ira, called, off, its, campaign, in, may, 1972, british, troop, concentrations, peaked, at, 1, 50, of, the, civilian, population, the, highest, ratio, found, in, the, history, of, counterinsurgency, warfare, higher, than, that, achieved, during, the, malayan, emergency, anti, british, national, liberation, war, to, which, the, conflict, is, frequently, compared, operation, motorman, the, military, operation, for, the, surge, was, the, biggest, military, operation, in, ireland, since, the, irish, war, of, independence, in, total, almost, 22, 000, british, forces, were, involved, in, the, days, before, 31, july, about, 4, 000, extra, troops, were, brought, into, northern, ireland, despite, a, temporary, ceasefire, in, 1972, and, talks, with, british, officials, the, provisionals, were, determined, to, continue, their, campaign, until, the, achievement, of, a, united, ireland, the, uk, government, in, london, believing, the, northern, ireland, administration, incapable, of, containing, the, security, situation, sought, to, take, over, the, control, of, law, and, order, there, as, this, was, unacceptable, to, the, northern, ireland, government, the, british, government, pushed, through, emergency, legislation, the, northern, ireland, temporary, provisions, act, 1972, which, suspended, the, unionist, controlled, stormont, parliament, and, government, and, introduced, direct, rule, from, london, direct, rule, was, initially, intended, as, a, short, term, measure, the, medium, term, strategy, was, to, restore, self, government, to, northern, ireland, on, a, basis, that, was, acceptable, to, both, unionists, and, nationalists, agreement, proved, elusive, however, and, the, troubles, continued, throughout, the, 1970s, 1980s, and, the, 1990s, within, a, context, of, political, deadlock, the, existence, of, no, go, areas, in, belfast, and, derry, was, a, challenge, to, the, authority, of, the, british, government, in, northern, ireland, and, the, british, army, demolished, the, barricades, and, re, established, control, over, the, areas, in, operation, motorman, on, 31, july, 1972, in, june, 1973, following, the, publication, of, a, british, white, paper, and, a, referendum, in, march, on, the, status, of, northern, ireland, a, new, parliamentary, body, the, northern, ireland, assembly, was, established, elections, to, this, body, were, held, on, 28, june, in, october, 1973, mainstream, nationalist, and, unionist, parties, along, with, the, british, and, irish, governments, negotiated, the, sunningdale, agreement, which, was, intended, to, produce, a, political, settlement, within, northern, ireland, but, with, a, so, called, irish, dimension, involving, the, republic, the, agreement, provided, for, power, sharing, the, creation, of, an, executive, containing, both, unionists, and, nationalists, and, a, council, of, ireland, a, body, made, up, of, ministers, from, northern, ireland, and, the, republic, that, was, designed, to, encourage, cross, border, co, operation, unionists, were, split, over, sunningdale, which, was, also, opposed, by, the, ira, whose, goal, remained, nothing, short, of, an, end, to, the, existence, of, northern, ireland, as, part, of, the, uk, many, unionists, opposed, the, concept, of, power, sharing, arguing, that, it, was, not, feasible, to, share, power, with, nationalists, who, sought, the, destruction, of, the, state, perhaps, more, significant, however, was, the, unionist, opposition, to, the, irish, dimension, and, the, council, of, ireland, which, was, perceived, as, being, an, all, ireland, parliament, in, waiting, remarks, by, a, young, social, democratic, and, labour, party, sdlp, councillor, hugh, logue, to, an, audience, at, trinity, college, dublin, that, sunningdale, was, the, tool, by, which, the, unionists, will, be, trundled, off, to, a, united, ireland, also, damaged, chances, of, significant, unionist, support, for, the, agreement, in, january, 1974, brian, faulkner, was, narrowly, deposed, as, uup, leader, and, replaced, by, harry, west, although, faulkner, retained, his, position, as, chief, executive, in, the, new, government, a, uk, general, election, in, february, 1974, gave, the, anti, sunningdale, unionists, the, opportunity, to, test, unionist, opinion, with, the, slogan, dublin, is, only, a, sunningdale, away, and, the, result, galvanised, their, support, they, won, 11, of, the, 12, seats, winning, 58, of, the, vote, with, most, of, the, rest, going, to, nationalists, and, pro, sunningdale, unionists, ultimately, the, sunningdale, agreement, was, brought, down, by, mass, action, on, the, part, of, loyalist, paramilitaries, and, workers, who, formed, the, ulster, workers, council, they, organised, a, general, strike, the, ulster, workers, council, strike, this, severely, curtailed, business, in, northern, ireland, and, cut, off, essential, services, such, as, water, and, electricity, nationalists, argue, that, the, british, government, did, not, do, enough, to, break, this, strike, and, uphold, the, sunningdale, initiative, there, is, evidence, that, the, strike, was, further, encouraged, by, mi5, a, part, of, their, campaign, to, disorientate, british, prime, minister, harold, wilson, s, government, see, also, harold, wilson, conspiracy, theories, faced, with, such, opposition, the, pro, sunningdale, unionists, resigned, from, the, power, sharing, government, and, the, new, regime, collapsed, three, days, into, the, uwc, strike, on, 17, may, 1974, two, uvf, teams, from, the, belfast, and, mid, ulster, brigades, detonated, three, no, warning, car, bombs, in, dublin, s, city, centre, during, the, friday, evening, rush, hour, resulting, in, 26, deaths, and, close, to, 300, injuries, ninety, minutes, later, a, fourth, car, bomb, exploded, in, monaghan, killing, seven, additional, people, nobody, has, ever, been, convicted, for, these, attacks, and, the, bombings, were, the, greatest, loss, of, life, in, a, single, day, during, the, troubles, even, as, his, government, deployed, troops, in, august, 1969, wilson, ordered, a, secret, study, of, whether, the, british, military, could, withdraw, from, northern, ireland, including, all, 45, bases, such, as, the, submarine, school, in, derry, the, study, concluded, that, the, military, could, do, so, in, three, months, but, if, increased, violence, collapsed, civil, society, britain, would, have, to, send, in, troops, again, without, bases, to, do, so, would, be, an, invasion, of, ireland, wilson, thus, decided, against, a, withdrawal, wilson, s, cabinet, discussed, the, more, drastic, step, of, complete, british, withdrawal, from, an, independent, northern, ireland, as, early, as, february, 1969, as, one, of, various, possibilities, for, the, region, including, direct, rule, he, wrote, in, 1971, that, britain, had, responsibility, without, power, there, and, secretly, met, with, the, ira, that, year, while, leader, of, the, opposition, his, government, in, late, 1974, and, early, 1975, again, met, with, the, ira, to, negotiate, a, ceasefire, during, the, meetings, the, parties, discussed, complete, british, withdrawal, although, the, british, government, publicly, stated, that, troops, would, stay, as, long, as, necessary, widespread, fear, from, the, birmingham, pub, bombings, and, other, ira, attacks, in, britain, itself, increased, support, among, mps, and, the, public, for, a, military, withdrawal, the, failure, of, sunningdale, and, the, effectiveness, of, the, uwc, strike, against, british, authority, were, more, evidence, to, wilson, of, his, 1971, statement, they, led, to, the, serious, consideration, in, london, of, independence, until, november, 1975, had, the, withdrawal, occurred, which, wilson, supported, but, others, including, james, callaghan, opposed, the, region, would, have, become, a, separate, dominion, according, to, the, secret, plan, codenamed, doomsday, britain, would, have, had, as, little, to, do, with, the, new, ulster, dominion, as, possible, with, financial, subsidies, ending, within, five, years, it, would, not, have, been, an, associated, state, with, britain, in, control, only, of, foreign, relations, because, a, war, between, ulster, and, the, republic, would, involve, britain, the, dominion, would, also, not, have, been, a, member, of, the, british, commonwealth, the, northern, ireland, office, cited, the, 1948, newfoundland, referendums, in, which, the, island, voluntarily, joined, canada, its, larger, neighbor, as, an, example, that, divided, ireland, might, hopefully, follow, the, british, negotiations, with, the, ira, an, illegal, organisation, angered, the, republic, s, government, it, did, not, know, what, was, discussed, but, feared, that, the, british, were, considering, abandoning, northern, ireland, irish, foreign, minister, garret, fitzgerald, discussed, in, a, memorandum, of, june, 1975, the, possibilities, of, orderly, withdrawal, and, independence, repartition, of, the, island, or, a, collapse, of, northern, ireland, into, civil, war, and, anarchy, the, memorandum, preferred, a, negotiated, independence, as, the, best, of, the, three, worst, case, scenarios, but, concluded, that, the, irish, government, could, do, little, the, irish, government, had, already, failed, to, prevent, a, crowd, from, the, burning, of, british, embassy, dublin, in, 1972, it, believed, that, ireland, could, not, enlarge, the, country, s, small, army, of, 12, 500, men, without, negative, consequences, a, civil, war, in, northern, ireland, would, cause, many, deaths, there, and, severe, consequences, for, the, republic, as, the, public, would, demand, that, it, intervene, to, protect, nationalists, fitzgerald, warned, callaghan, that, the, failure, to, intervene, despite, ireland, s, inability, to, do, so, would, threaten, democratic, government, in, the, republic, which, would, jeopardise, british, and, european, security, against, communist, and, other, foreign, nations, wilson, s, aides, had, in, 1969, come, to, a, similar, conclusion, telling, him, that, removing, northern, ireland, from, the, united, kingdom, would, cause, violence, and, a, military, intervention, by, the, republic, that, would, not, allow, the, removal, of, british, troops, loyalist, leader, glen, barr, said, in, 2008, that, a, british, withdrawal, would, have, caused, civil, war, as, loyalists, would, have, expected, the, republic, to, invade, northern, ireland, peter, ramsbotham, british, ambassador, to, the, united, states, warned, of, a, hostile, american, reaction, wilson, s, desire, to, extricate, the, british, government, from, northern, ireland, was, ultimately, stymied, by, the, fear, that, doing, so, might, lead, to, catastrophe, the, irish, government, so, dreaded, the, consequences, that, fitzgerald, refused, to, ask, britain, not, to, withdraw, as, he, feared, that, openly, discussing, the, issue, could, permit, the, british, to, proceed, and, other, members, of, government, opposed, the, irish, cabinet, even, discussing, what, fitzgerald, referred, to, as, a, doomsday, scenario, he, wrote, in, 2006, that, neither, then, nor, since, has, public, opinion, in, ireland, realised, how, close, to, disaster, our, whole, island, came, during, the, last, two, years, of, harold, wilson, s, premiership, and, in, 2008, said, that, the, republic, was, more, at, risk, then, than, at, any, time, since, our, formation, in, february, 1974, an, ira, time, bomb, killed, 12, people, on, a, coach, on, the, m62, in, the, west, riding, of, yorkshire, merlyn, rees, the, secretary, of, state, for, northern, ireland, lifted, the, proscription, against, the, uvf, in, april, 1974, in, december, a, month, after, the, birmingham, pub, bombings, killed, 21, people, the, ira, declared, a, ceasefire, this, would, theoretically, last, throughout, most, of, the, following, year, the, ceasefire, notwithstanding, sectarian, killings, escalated, in, 1975, along, with, internal, feuding, between, rival, paramilitary, groups, this, made, 1975, one, of, the, bloodiest, years, of, the, conflict, on, 7, august, 1974, a, 24, year, old, man, from, limehill, near, pomeroy, county, tyrone, was, shot, in, the, back, and, killed, by, a, member, of, the, british, army, first, battalion, royal, regiment, of, wales, at, the, first, inquest, the, soldier, was, cleared, of, all, charges, but, in, 2020, another, inquest, was, ordered, by, the, attorney, general, the, inquest, was, the, first, in, a, series, of, coroners, inquiries, into, deaths, associated, with, the, troubles, the, coroner, ruled, that, the, killing, of, paddy, mcelhone, was, unjustified, with, a, judge, stating, an, innocent, man, shot, in, cold, blood, without, warning, when, he, was, no, threat, to, anyone, the, mcelhone, family, issued, a, statement, reading, in, part, our, family, always, knew, that, paddy, was, an, innocent, young, man, taken, from, his, home, and, shot, by, a, british, soldier, for, no, reason, the, statement, also, said, that, his, parents, went, to, their, graves, broken, hearted, knowing, that, their, innocent, son, had, been, killed, without, justification, explanation, or, apology, on, 5, april, 1975, irish, republican, paramilitary, members, killed, a, uda, volunteer, and, four, protestant, civilians, in, a, gun, and, bomb, attack, at, the, mountainview, tavern, on, the, shankill, road, belfast, the, attack, was, claimed, by, the, republican, action, force, believed, to, be, a, covername, used, by, provisional, ira, ira, volunteers, on, 31, july, 1975, at, buskhill, outside, newry, popular, irish, cabaret, band, the, miami, showband, was, returning, home, to, dublin, after, a, gig, in, banbridge, when, it, was, ambushed, by, gunmen, from, the, uvf, mid, ulster, brigade, wearing, british, army, uniforms, at, a, bogus, military, roadside, checkpoint, on, the, main, a1, road, three, of, the, bandmembers, two, catholics, and, a, protestant, were, shot, dead, while, two, of, the, uvf, men, were, killed, when, the, bomb, they, had, loaded, onto, the, band, s, minibus, detonated, prematurely, the, following, january, eleven, protestant, workers, were, gunned, down, in,

felt, in, the, early, 1970s, that, it, could, force, a, rapid, british, withdrawal, from, northern, ireland, and, instead, developed, a, strategy, known, as, the, long, war, which, involved, a, less, intense, but, more, sustained, campaign, of, violence, that, could, continue, indefinitely, the, official, ira, ceasefire, of, 1972, however, became, permanent, and, the, official, movement,

although, political, violence, is, greatly, reduced, sectarian, animosity, has, not, disappeared, residential, areas, are, more, segregated, between, catholic, nationalists, and, protestant,

activities, within, the, island, of, ireland, and, great, britain, the, northern, ireland, affairs, select, committee, report, of, june, 2002, stated, that, historically, the, vast, majority, of, paramilitary, funds, for, both, republican, and, loyalist, groups, have, been, generated, within, northern, ireland, the, primary, reason, for, this, is, the, relative, ease, of, raising, funds, within, these, communities, sympathy, for, the, cause, is, greatest, within, the, originating, community, those, concerned, also, have, the, local, knowledge, which, facilitates, crime, or, the, direct, intimidation, of, individuals, from, whom, money, is, sought, the, fact, that, northern, ireland, remains, predominantly, a, cash, economy, also, encourages, a, local, focus, as, it, facilitates, money, laundering, and, makes, it, difficult, for, the, law, enforcement, agencies, to, trace, transactions, there, were, many, incidents, of, collusion, between, the, british, state, security, forces, the, british, army, and, ruc, and, loyalist, paramilitaries, this, included, soldiers, and, policemen, taking, part, in, loyalist, attacks, while, off, duty, giving, weapons, and, intelligence, to, loyalists, not, taking, action, against, loyalists, and, hindering, police, investigations, the, de, silva, report, found, that, during, the, 1980s, 85, of, the, intelligence, loyalists, used, to, target, people, came, from, the, security, forces, who, in, turn, also, had, double, agents, and, informers, within, loyalist, groups, who, organised, attacks, on, the, orders, of, or, with, the, knowledge, of, their, handlers, of, the, 210, loyalists, arrested, by, the, stevens, inquiries, team, all, but, three, were, found, to, be, state, agents, or, informers, the, british, army, s, locally, recruited, ulster, defence, regiment, udr, was, almost, wholly, protestant, despite, recruits, being, vetted, some, loyalist, militants, managed, to, enlist, mainly, to, obtain, weapons, training, and, information, a, 1973, british, government, document, uncovered, in, 2004, subversion, in, the, udr, suggested, that, 5, 15, of, udr, soldiers, then, were, members, of, loyalist, paramilitaries, the, report, said, the, udr, was, the, main, source, of, weapons, for, those, groups, although, by, 1973, udr, weapons, losses, had, dropped, significantly, partly, due, to, stricter, controls, in, 1977, the, army, investigated, a, udr, battalion, based, at, girdwood, barracks, belfast, the, investigation, found, that, 70, soldiers, had, links, to, the, uvf, that, thirty, soldiers, had, fraudulently, diverted, up, to, 47, 000, to, the, uvf, and, that, uvf, members, socialised, with, soldiers, in, their, mess, following, this, two, udr, members, were, dismissed, the, investigation, was, halted, after, a, senior, officer, claimed, it, was, harming, morale, by, 1990, at, least, 197, udr, soldiers, had, been, convicted, of, loyalist, terrorist, offences, and, other, serious, crimes, including, 19, convicted, of, murder, this, was, only, a, small, fraction, of, those, who, served, in, the, udr, but, the, proportion, was, higher, than, the, regular, british, army, the, ruc, and, the, civilian, population, during, the, 1970s, the, glenanne, gang, a, secret, alliance, of, loyalist, militants, british, soldiers, and, ruc, officers, carried, out, a, string, of, gun, and, bomb, attacks, against, nationalists, in, an, area, of, northern, ireland, known, as, the, murder, triangle, it, also, carried, out, some, attacks, in, the, republic, killing, about, 120, people, in, total, mostly, uninvolved, civilians, the, cassel, report, investigated, 76, murders, attributed, to, the, group, and, found, evidence, that, soldiers, and, policemen, were, involved, in, 74, of, those, one, member, ruc, officer, john, weir, claimed, his, superiors, knew, of, the, collusion, but, allowed, it, to, continue, the, cassel, report, also, stated, some, senior, officers, knew, of, the, crimes, but, did, nothing, to, prevent, investigate, or, punish, perpetrators, attacks, attributed, to, the, group, include, the, dublin, and, monaghan, bombings, 1974, the, miami, showband, killings, 1975, and, the, reavey, and, o, dowd, killings, 1976, the, stevens, inquiries, found, that, elements, of, the, security, forces, had, used, loyalists, as, proxies, who, via, double, agents, and, informers, had, helped, loyalist, groups, to, kill, targeted, individuals, usually, suspected, republicans, but, also, civilians, both, intentionally, and, otherwise, the, inquiries, concluded, this, had, intensified, and, prolonged, the, conflict, the, british, army, s, force, research, unit, fru, was, the, main, agency, involved, brian, nelson, the, uda, s, chief, intelligence, officer, was, a, fru, agent, through, nelson, fru, helped, loyalists, target, people, for, assassination, fru, commanders, say, they, helped, loyalists, target, only, suspected, or, known, republican, activists, and, prevented, the, killing, of, civilians, the, inquiries, found, evidence, only, two, lives, were, saved, and, that, nelson, fru, was, responsible, for, at, least, 30, murders, and, many, other, attacks, many, on, civilians, one, victim, was, solicitor, pat, finucane, nelson, also, supervised, the, shipping, of, weapons, to, loyalists, in, 1988, from, 1992, to, 1994, loyalists, were, responsible, for, more, deaths, than, republicans, partly, due, to, fru, involvement, members, of, the, security, forces, tried, to, obstruct, the, stevens, investigation, a, police, ombudsman, report, from, 2007, revealed, that, uvf, members, had, been, allowed, to, commit, a, string, of, terrorist, offences, including, murder, while, working, as, informers, for, ruc, special, branch, it, found, that, special, branch, had, given, informers, immunity, by, ensuring, they, were, not, caught, or, convicted, and, blocking, weapons, searches, ombudsman, nuala, o, loan, concluded, that, this, had, led, to, hundreds, of, deaths, and, said, senior, british, government, officials, pressured, her, into, halting, her, investigation, uvf, member, robin, jackson, has, been, linked, to, between, 50, and, 100, killings, in, northern, ireland, although, he, was, never, convicted, for, any, it, is, alleged, by, many, including, members, of, the, security, forces, that, jackson, was, an, ruc, agent, the, irish, government, s, barron, report, alleged, that, jackson, also, had, relationships, with, british, intelligence, in, 2016, a, new, ombudsman, report, concluded, that, there, had, been, collusion, between, the, police, and, the, uvf, in, relation, to, the, deaths, of, six, catholic, men, in, the, 1994, loughinisland, massacre, and, that, the, investigation, was, undermined, by, the, wish, to, protect, informers, but, found, no, evidence, police, had, foreknowledge, of, the, attack, the, smithwick, tribunal, concluded, that, a, member, of, the, garda, s, och, na, the, republic, of, ireland, s, police, force, colluded, with, the, ira, in, the, killing, of, two, senior, ruc, officers, in, 1989, the, two, officers, were, ambushed, by, the, ira, near, jonesborough, county, armagh, when, returning, from, a, cross, border, security, conference, in, dundalk, in, the, republic, of, ireland, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, republican, and, loyalist, paramilitaries, abducted, a, number, of, individuals, many, alleged, to, have, been, informers, who, were, then, secretly, killed, and, buried, eighteen, people, two, women, and, sixteen, men, including, one, british, army, officer, were, kidnapped, and, killed, during, the, troubles, they, are, referred, to, informally, as, the, disappeared, all, but, one, lisa, dorrian, were, abducted, and, killed, by, republicans, dorrian, is, believed, to, have, been, abducted, by, loyalists, the, remains, of, all, but, four, of, the, disappeared, have, been, recovered, and, turned, over, to, their, families, british, government, security, forces, including, the, military, reaction, force, mrf, carried, out, what, have, been, described, as, extrajudicial, killings, of, unarmed, civilians, their, victims, were, often, catholic, or, suspected, catholic, civilians, unaffiliated, with, any, paramilitaries, such, as, the, whiterock, road, shooting, of, two, unarmed, catholic, civilians, by, british, soldiers, on, 15, april, 1972, and, the, andersonstown, shooting, of, seven, unarmed, catholic, civilians, on, 12, may, that, same, year, a, member, of, the, mrf, stated, in, 1978, that, the, army, often, attempted, false, flag, sectarian, attacks, provoking, sectarian, conflict, and, taking, the, heat, off, the, army, a, former, member, stated, e, were, not, there, to, act, like, an, army, unit, we, were, there, to, act, like, a, terror, group, republicans, allege, that, the, security, forces, operated, a, shoot, to, kill, policy, rather, than, arresting, ira, suspects, the, security, forces, denied, this, and, pointed, out, that, six, of, the, eight, ira, men, killed, in, the, loughgall, ambush, in, 1987, were, heavily, armed, on, the, other, hand, the, shooting, of, three, unarmed, ira, members, in, gibraltar, by, the, special, air, service, ten, months, later, appeared, to, confirm, suspicions, among, republicans, and, in, the, british, and, irish, media, of, a, tacit, british, shoot, to, kill, policy, of, suspected, ira, members, inter, communal, tensions, rise, and, violence, often, breaks, out, during, the, marching, season, when, the, protestant, orange, order, parades, take, place, across, northern, ireland, the, parades, are, held, to, commemorate, william, of, orange, s, victory, in, the, battle, of, the, boyne, in, 1690, which, secured, the, protestant, ascendancy, and, british, rule, in, ireland, one, particular, flashpoint, which, has, caused, continuous, annual, strife, is, the, garvaghy, road, area, in, portadown, where, an, orange, parade, from, drumcree, church, passes, through, a, mainly, nationalist, estate, off, the, garvaghy, road, this, parade, has, now, been, banned, indefinitely, following, nationalist, riots, against, the, parade, and, loyalist, counter, riots, against, its, banning, in, 1995, 1996, and, 1997, there, were, several, weeks, of, prolonged, rioting, throughout, northern, ireland, over, the, impasse, at, drumcree, a, number, of, people, died, in, this, violence, including, a, catholic, taxi, driver, killed, by, the, loyalist, volunteer, force, and, three, of, four, nominally, catholic, brothers, from, a, mixed, religion, family, died, when, their, house, in, ballymoney, was, petrol, bombed, the, impact, of, the, troubles, on, the, ordinary, people, of, northern, ireland, has, been, compared, to, that, of, the, blitz, on, the, people, of, london, the, stress, resulting, from, bomb, attacks, street, disturbances, security, checkpoints, and, the, constant, military, presence, had, the, strongest, effect, on, children, and, young, adults, there, was, also, the, fear, that, local, paramilitaries, instilled, in, their, respective, communities, with, the, punishment, beatings, romperings, and, the, occasional, tarring, and, feathering, meted, out, to, individuals, for, various, purported, infractions, in, addition, to, the, violence, and, intimidation, there, was, chronic, unemployment, and, a, severe, housing, shortage, many, people, were, rendered, homeless, as, a, result, of, intimidation, or, having, their, houses, burnt, and, urban, redevelopment, played, a, role, in, the, social, upheaval, belfast, families, faced, being, transferred, to, new, alien, estates, when, older, decrepit, districts, such, as, sailortown, and, the, pound, loney, were, being, demolished, according, to, social, worker, and, author, sarah, nelson, this, problem, of, homelessness, and, disorientation, contributed, to, the, breakdown, of, the, normal, fabric, of, society, allowing, for, paramilitaries, to, exert, a, strong, influence, in, certain, districts, vandalism, was, also, a, major, problem, in, the, 1970s, there, were, 10, 000, vandalised, empty, houses, in, belfast, alone, most, of, the, vandals, were, aged, between, eight, and, thirteen, according, to, one, historian, of, the, conflict, the, stress, of, the, troubles, engendered, a, breakdown, in, the, previously, strict, sexual, morality, of, northern, ireland, resulting, in, a, confused, hedonism, in, respect, of, personal, life, in, derry, illegitimate, births, and, alcoholism, increased, for, women, and, the, divorce, rate, rose, teenage, alcoholism, was, also, a, problem, partly, as, a, result, of, the, drinking, clubs, established, in, both, loyalist, and, republican, areas, in, many, cases, there, was, little, parental, supervision, of, children, in, some, of, the, poorer, districts, the, department, of, health, has, looked, at, a, report, written, in, 2007, by, mike, tomlinson, of, queen, s, university, which, asserted, that, the, legacy, of, the, troubles, has, played, a, substantial, role, in, the, current, rate, of, suicide, in, northern, ireland, further, social, issues, arising, from, the, troubles, include, antisocial, behavior, and, an, aversion, towards, political, participation, according, to, one, historian, children, raised, during, the, troubles, were, found, to, develop, similar, antisocial, external, behaviors, as, children, similarly, born, in, regions, of, conflict, notably, those, born, and, raised, during, world, war, ii, further, studies, into, the, impact, of, violence, on, the, psychological, development, of, children, in, northern, ireland, also, found, that, those, raised, during, the, troubles, were, more, likely, to, be, averse, towards, political, participation, noting, that, while, older, generations, still, actively, associated, with, their, own, social, and, political, groups, younger, generations, became, wary, of, such, groups, as, social, and, political, divisions, continued, to, expand, during, the, thirty, years, of, the, troubles, peace, lines, which, were, built, in, northern, ireland, during, the, early, years, of, the, troubles, remain, in, place, according, to, a, 2022, poll, 69, of, irish, nationalists, polled, believe, there, was, no, option, but, violent, resistance, to, british, rule, during, the, troubles, according, to, the, conflict, archive, on, the, internet, cain, 3, 532, people, were, killed, as, a, result, of, the, conflict, between, 1969, and, 2001, of, these, 3, 489, were, killed, up, to, 1998, according, to, the, book, lost, lives, 2006, edition, 3, 720, people, were, killed, as, a, result, of, the, conflict, from, 1966, to, 2006, of, these, 3, 635, were, killed, up, to, 1998, in, the, politics, of, antagonism, understanding, northern, ireland, brendan, o, leary, and, john, mcgarry, point, out, that, nearly, two, per, cent, of, the, population, of, northern, ireland, have, been, killed, or, injured, through, political, violence, if, the, equivalent, ratio, of, victims, to, population, had, been, produced, in, great, britain, in, the, same, period, some, 100, 000, people, would, have, died, and, if, a, similar, level, of, political, violence, had, taken, place, the, number, of, fatalities, in, the, usa, would, have, been, over, 500, 000, using, this, relative, comparison, to, the, us, analyst, john, m, gates, suggests, that, whatever, one, calls, the, conflict, it, was, certainly, not, a, low, intensity, conflict, in, 2010, it, was, estimated, that, 107, 000, people, in, northern, ireland, suffered, some, physical, injury, as, a, result, of, the, conflict, on, the, basis, of, data, gathered, by, the, northern, ireland, statistics, and, research, agency, the, victims, commission, estimated, that, the, conflict, resulted, in, 500, 000, victims, in, northern, ireland, alone, it, defines, victims, are, those, who, are, directly, affected, by, bereavement, physical, injury, or, trauma, as, a, result, of, the, conflict, one, statistical, breakdown, of, troubles, deaths, put, the, death, toll, at, 3, 466, with, 3, 218, lives, lost, in, northern, ireland, 125, in, great, britain, 105, in, the, republic, of, ireland, and, 18, in, the, rest, of, europe, republican, paramilitaries, were, responsible, for, some, 60, of, all, deaths, loyalists, 30, and, british, security, forces, 10, loyalists, killed, 48, of, the, civilian, casualties, republicans, killed, 39, and, the, british, security, forces, killed, 10, most, of, the, catholic, civilians, were, killed, by, loyalists, and, most, of, the, protestant, civilians, were, killed, by, republicans, of, those, killed, by, republican, paramilitaries, of, those, killed, by, loyalist, paramilitaries, of, those, killed, by, british, security, forces, approximately, 52, of, the, dead, were, civilians, 32, were, members, or, former, members, of, the, british, security, forces, 11, were, members, of, republican, paramilitaries, and, 5, were, members, of, loyalist, paramilitaries, about, 60, of, the, civilian, casualties, were, catholics, 30, of, the, civilians, were, protestants, and, the, rest, were, from, outside, northern, ireland, about, 257, of, those, killed, were, children, under, the, age, of, seventeen, representing, 7, 2, of, the, total, while, 274, children, under, the, age, of, eighteen, were, killed, during, the, conflict, it, has, been, the, subject, of, dispute, whether, some, individuals, were, members, of, paramilitary, organisations, several, casualties, that, were, listed, as, civilians, were, later, claimed, by, the, ira, as, their, members, one, ulster, defence, association, uda, and, three, ulster, volunteer, force, uvf, members, killed, during, the, conflict, were, also, ulster, defence, regiment, udr, soldiers, at, the, time, of, their, deaths, at, least, one, civilian, victim, was, an, off, duty, member, of, the,
