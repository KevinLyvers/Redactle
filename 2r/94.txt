africa, and, south, arabia, from, classical, antiquity, to, the, middle, ages, based, in, what, is, now, northern, ethiopia, and, eritrea, and, spanning, present, day, djibouti, and, sudan, emerging, from, the, earlier, d, mt, civilization, the, kingdom, was, founded, in, 1st, century, the, city, of, axum, served, as, the, kingdom, s, capital, for, many, centuries, until, it, relocated, to, kubar, in, the, 9th, century, due, to, declining, trade, connections, and, recurring, external, invasions, the, kingdom, of, aksum, was, considered, one, of, the, four, great, powers, of, the, 3rd, century, by, the, persian, prophet, mani, alongside, persia, rome, and, china, aksum, continued, to, expand, under, the, reign, of, gedara, c, 200, 230, who, was, the, first, king, to, be, involved, in, south, arabian, affairs, his, reign, resulted, in, the, control, of, much, of, western, yemen, such, as, the, tih, mah, najr, ma, afir, af, r, until, c, 230, and, parts, of, hashid, territory, around, hamir, in, the, northern, highlands, until, a, joint, himyarite, sabean, alliance, pushed, them, out, aksum, himyar, conflicts, persisted, throughout, the, 3rd, century, during, the, reign, of, endubis, 270, 310, aksum, began, minting, coins, that, have, been, excavated, as, far, away, as, caesarea, and, southern, india, as, the, kingdom, became, a, major, power, on, the, trade, route, between, rome, and, india, and, gained, a, monopoly, of, indian, ocean, trade, it, entered, the, greco, roman, cultural, sphere, due, to, its, ties, with, the, greco, roman, world, aksum, adopted, christianity, as, the, state, religion, in, the, mid, 4th, century, under, ezana, 320s, c, 360, following, their, christianization, the, aksumites, ceased, construction, of, stelae, the, kingdom, continued, to, expand, throughout, late, antiquity, conquering, kush, under, ezana, in, 330, for, a, short, period, of, time, and, inheriting, from, it, the, greek, exonym, ethiopia, aksumite, dominance, in, the, red, sea, culminated, during, the, reign, of, kaleb, of, axum, 514, 542, who, at, the, behest, of, the, byzantine, emperor, justin, i, invaded, the, himyarite, kingdom, in, yemen, in, order, to, end, the, persecution, of, christians, perpetrated, by, the, jewish, king, dhu, nuwas, with, the, annexation, of, himyar, the, kingdom, of, aksum, was, at, its, largest, territorial, extent, being, around, 2, 500, 000, km, 2, however, the, territory, was, lost, in, the, aksumite, persian, wars, aksum, held, on, to, southern, arabia, from, 520, until, 525, when, sumyafa, ashwa, was, deposed, by, abraha, the, kingdom, s, slow, decline, had, begun, by, the, 7th, century, at, which, point, currency, ceased, to, be, minted, the, persian, and, later, muslim, presence, in, the, red, sea, caused, aksum, to, suffer, economically, and, the, population, of, the, city, of, axum, shrank, alongside, environmental, and, internal, factors, this, has, been, suggested, as, the, reason, for, its, decline, aksum, s, final, three, centuries, are, considered, a, dark, age, and, through, uncertain, circumstances, the, kingdom, collapsed, around, 960, despite, its, position, as, one, of, the, foremost, empires, of, late, antiquity, the, kingdom, of, aksum, fell, into, obscurity, as, ethiopia, remained, isolated, throughout, the, late, middle, ages, carlo, conti, rossini, believed, that, the, word, aksum, is, of, semitic, root, and, means, a, green, and, dense, garden, full, of, grass, before, the, establishment, of, axum, the, tigray, plateau, of, northern, ethiopia, was, home, to, a, kingdom, known, as, d, mt, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, the, kingdom, was, influenced, by, sabaeans, from, modern, day, yemen, scholarly, consensus, had, previously, been, that, sabaeans, had, been, the, founders, of, semitic, civilization, in, ethiopia, though, this, has, now, been, refuted, and, their, influence, is, considered, to, have, been, minor, the, sabaean, presence, likely, lasted, only, for, a, matter, of, decades, but, their, influence, on, later, aksumite, civilization, included, the, adoption, of, ancient, south, arabian, script, which, developed, into, ge, ez, script, and, ancient, semitic, religion, the, initial, centuries, of, aksum, s, development, transitioning, from, a, modest, regional, center, to, a, significant, power, remain, largely, obscure, stone, age, artifacts, have, been, unearthed, at, gobedra, two, kilometers, west, of, aksum, excavations, on, beta, giyorgis, a, hill, to, the, northwest, of, aksum, validate, the, pre, aksumite, roots, of, a, settlement, in, the, vicinity, of, aksum, dating, back, to, approximately, the, 7th, to, 4th, centuries, bc, further, evidence, from, excavations, in, the, stele, park, at, the, heart, of, aksum, corroborates, continuous, activity, in, the, area, from, the, outset, of, the, common, era, two, hills, and, two, streams, lie, on, the, east, and, west, expanses, of, the, city, of, aksum, perhaps, providing, the, initial, impetus, for, settling, this, area, archeological, evidence, suggests, that, the, aksumite, polity, arose, between, 150, bc, and, 150, ad, small, scale, district, kingdoms, denoted, by, very, large, nucleated, communities, with, one, or, more, elite, residences, appears, to, have, existed, in, the, early, period, of, the, kingdom, of, aksum, and, here, stuart, munro, hay, concludes, that, quite, probably, the, kingdom, was, a, confederacy, one, which, was, led, by, a, district, level, king, who, commanded, the, allegiance, of, other, petty, kings, within, the, axumite, realm, the, ruler, of, the, axumite, kingdom, was, thus, king, of, kings, a, title, often, found, in, inscriptions, of, this, period, there, is, no, evidence, that, a, single, royal, lineage, has, yet, emerged, and, it, is, quite, possible, that, at, the, death, of, a, king, of, kings, a, new, one, would, be, selected, from, among, all, the, kings, in, the, confederacy, rather, than, through, some, principle, of, primogeniture, the, first, historical, mention, of, axum, comes, from, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, a, trading, guide, which, likely, dates, to, the, mid, 1st, century, ad, axum, is, mentioned, alongside, adulis, and, ptolemais, of, the, hunts, as, lying, within, the, realm, of, zoskales, the, area, is, described, as, a, primarily, producing, ivory, as, well, as, tortoise, shells, king, zoskales, had, a, greek, education, indicating, that, greco, roman, influence, was, already, present, at, this, time, it, is, evident, from, the, periplus, that, even, at, this, early, stage, of, its, history, axum, played, a, role, in, the, transcontinental, trade, route, between, rome, and, india, the, aksumite, control, over, adulis, enabled, the, exchange, of, ethiopian, products, for, foreign, imports, both, pliny, the, elder, and, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, make, reference, to, this, port, situated, three, days, away, from, the, initial, ivory, market, at, coloe, itself, five, days, distant, from, aksum, this, trade, across, the, red, sea, spanning, from, the, roman, empire, in, the, north, to, india, and, ceylon, in, the, east, played, a, crucial, role, in, aksum, s, prosperity, the, city, thrived, by, exporting, goods, such, as, ivory, tortoiseshell, and, rhinoceros, horn, pliny, also, mentioned, additional, items, like, hippopotamus, hide, monkeys, and, slaves, during, the, 2nd, century, ad, ptolemy, s, geographer, referred, to, aksum, as, a, powerful, kingdom, both, archaeological, findings, and, textual, evidence, suggest, that, during, this, period, a, centralized, regional, polity, had, emerged, in, the, aksumite, area, characterized, by, defined, social, stratification, by, the, beginning, of, the, 4th, century, ad, the, aksumite, state, had, become, well, established, featuring, urban, centers, an, official, currency, with, coinage, struck, in, gold, silver, and, copper, an, intensive, agricultural, system, and, a, organized, military, around, 200, ad, aksumite, ambitions, had, expanded, to, southern, arabia, where, aksum, appears, to, have, established, itself, in, al, maafer, and, engaged, in, conflicts, with, saba, and, himyar, at, various, points, forming, different, alliances, with, chief, kingdoms, and, tribes, during, the, early, part, of, the, 3rd, century, the, kings, gdrt, and, dbh, dispatched, military, expeditions, to, the, region, inscriptions, from, local, arabian, dynasties, refer, to, these, rulers, with, the, title, nagasi, of, aksum, and, habashat, and, a, metal, object, discovered, in, eastern, tigray, also, mentions, a, certain, gdr, negus, of, aksum, later, in, the, century, the, mlky, hhst, dtwns, wzqrns, kings, of, habashat, dtwns, and, zqrns, are, also, mentioned, fighting, in, arabia, according, to, a, greek, inscription, in, eritrea, known, as, the, monumentum, adulitanum, recorded, by, cosmas, indicopleustes, in, around, the, mid, to, late, 3rd, century, possibly, c, 240, c, 260, the, aksumites, led, by, an, anonymous, king, achieved, significant, territorial, expansion, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, and, the, arabian, peninsula, with, their, influence, extending, as, far, as, lake, tana, and, the, borders, of, egypt, by, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, ad, aksum, had, gained, recognition, by, the, prophet, mani, in, the, kephalaia, as, one, of, the, four, great, powers, of, the, world, alongside, rome, persia, and, china, as, the, political, influence, of, aksum, expanded, so, did, the, grandeur, of, its, monuments, excavations, by, archaeological, expeditions, revealed, early, use, of, stelae, evolving, from, plain, and, rough, markers, to, some, of, the, largest, monuments, in, africa, the, granite, stelae, in, the, main, cemetery, housing, aksumite, royal, tombs, transformed, from, plain, to, carefully, dressed, granite, eventually, carved, to, resemble, multi, storey, towers, in, a, distinctive, architectural, style, aksumite, architecture, featured, massive, dressed, granite, blocks, smaller, uncut, stones, for, walling, mud, mortar, bricks, for, vaulting, and, arches, and, a, visible, wooden, framework, known, as, monkey, heads, or, square, corner, extrusions, walls, inclined, inwards, and, incorporated, several, recessed, bays, for, added, strength, aksum, and, other, cities, such, as, adulis, and, matara, boasted, substantial, palace, buildings, employing, this, architectural, style, in, the, early, 6th, century, cosmas, indicopleustes, described, his, visit, to, aksum, mentioning, the, four, towered, palace, of, the, aksumite, king, adorned, with, bronze, statues, of, unicorns, aksum, also, featured, rows, of, monumental, granite, thrones, likely, bearing, metal, statues, dedicated, to, pre, christian, deities, these, thrones, incorporated, large, panels, at, the, sides, and, back, with, inscriptions, attributed, to, ousanas, ezana, kaleb, and, his, son, wazeba, serving, as, victory, monuments, documenting, the, wars, of, these, kings, king, ezana, became, the, first, christian, ruler, of, aksum, in, the, 4th, century, ezana, s, coins, and, inscriptions, make, the, change, from, pre, christian, imagery, to, christian, symbolism, around, 340, ad, the, conversion, to, christianity, was, one, of, the, most, revolutionary, events, in, the, history, of, ethiopia, as, it, gave, aksum, a, cultural, link, with, the, mediterranean, aksum, gained, a, political, link, with, the, byzantine, empire, which, regarded, itself, as, the, protector, of, christendom, three, inscriptions, on, the, ezana, stone, documents, the, conversion, of, king, ezana, to, christianity, and, two, of, his, military, expeditions, against, neighboring, areas, one, inscribed, in, greek, and, the, other, in, geez, the, two, expeditions, refers, to, two, distinct, campaigns, one, against, the, noba, and, the, other, against, the, beja, according, to, the, inscription, the, noba, were, settled, somewhere, around, the, nile, and, atbara, confluence, where, they, seemed, to, have, taken, over, much, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, yet, they, did, not, drive, the, kushites, away, from, their, heartland, since, the, inscription, states, that, the, aksumites, fought, them, at, the, junction, of, the, two, rivers, also, mentioned, in, the, inscription, are, the, mysterious, red, noba, against, whom, an, expedition, was, carried, out, this, people, seems, to, be, settled, further, north, and, may, be, identical, with, the, other, nobades, mentioned, in, the, inscription, of, the, nubian, king, silko, carved, on, the, wall, of, the, temple, of, kalabsha, king, kaleb, sent, an, expedition, against, the, jewish, himyarite, king, dhu, nuwas, who, was, persecuting, the, christian, community, in, yemen, kaleb, gained, widespread, acclaim, in, his, era, as, the, conqueror, of, yemen, he, expanded, his, royal, title, to, include, king, of, hadramawt, in, southeastern, yemen, as, well, as, the, coastal, plain, and, highland, of, yemen, along, with, all, their, arabs, highlighting, the, extensive, influence, of, aksum, across, the, red, sea, into, arabia, dhu, nuwas, was, deposed, and, killed, and, kaleb, appointed, an, arab, viceroy, named, esimiphaios, sumuafa, ashawa, but, his, rule, was, short, lived, as, he, was, ousted, in, a, coup, led, by, an, aksumite, named, abraha, after, five, years, kaleb, sent, two, expeditions, against, abraha, but, both, were, decisively, defeated, according, to, procopius, following, aksum, s, unsuccessful, attempts, to, remove, him, abraha, continued, to, govern, yemen, through, a, tribute, arrangement, with, the, king, of, aksum, after, abraha, s, death, his, son, masruq, abraha, continued, the, aksumite, vice, royalty, in, yemen, resuming, payment, of, tribute, to, aksum, however, his, half, brother, ma, d, karib, revolted, ma, d, karib, first, sought, help, from, the, roman, emperor, justinian, the, great, but, having, been, denied, he, decided, to, ally, with, the, sassanid, persian, emperor, khosrow, i, triggering, the, aksumite, persian, wars, khosrow, i, sent, a, small, fleet, and, army, under, commander, vahrez, to, depose, the, king, of, yemen, the, war, culminated, with, the, siege, of, sana, a, capital, of, aksumite, yemen, after, its, fall, in, 570, and, masruq, s, death, ma, d, karib, s, son, saif, was, put, on, the, throne, in, 575, the, war, resumed, again, after, saif, was, killed, by, aksumites, the, persian, general, vahrez, led, another, army, of, 8000, ending, axum, rule, in, yemen, and, becoming, hereditary, governor, of, yemen, according, to, stuart, munro, hay, these, wars, may, have, been, aksum, s, swan, song, as, a, great, power, with, an, overall, weakening, of, aksumite, authority, and, over, expenditure, in, money, and, manpower, aksumite, trade, in, the, red, sea, likely, suffered, due, to, the, persian, conquests, in, egypt, and, syria, followed, by, the, defeats, in, yemen, however, a, more, enduring, impact, occurred, with, the, rise, of, islam, in, the, early, 7th, century, and, the, expansion, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, axum, initially, had, good, relations, with, its, islamic, neighbours, in, 615, ad, for, example, early, muslims, from, mecca, fleeing, qurayshi, persecution, traveled, to, axum, and, were, given, refuge, this, journey, is, known, in, islamic, history, as, the, first, hijrah, in, 630, muhammad, sent, a, naval, expedition, against, suspected, abyssinian, pirates, the, expedition, of, alqammah, bin, mujazziz, trade, with, the, roman, byzantine, world, came, to, a, halt, as, the, arabs, seized, the, eastern, roman, provinces, consequently, aksum, experienced, a, decline, in, prosperity, due, to, increased, isolation, and, eventually, ceased, production, of, coins, in, the, early, 8th, century, the, islamic, conquests, were, not, solely, responsible, for, the, decline, of, aksum, another, reason, for, the, decline, was, the, expansions, of, the, beja, nomads, due, to, the, poverty, of, their, country, many, of, them, began, to, migrate, into, the, northern, ethiopian, plateau, at, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, ad, a, strong, beja, tribe, known, as, the, zanafaj, entered, the, eritrean, plateau, through, the, valley, of, gash, barka, they, overran, and, pillaged, much, of, the, eritrean, highlands, as, the, aksum, could, no, longer, maintain, its, sovereignty, over, the, frontier, as, a, result, the, connection, to, the, red, sea, ports, was, lost, around, this, same, time, the, aksumite, population, was, forced, to, go, farther, inland, to, the, highlands, for, protection, abandoning, aksum, as, the, capital, arab, writers, of, the, time, continued, to, describe, ethiopia, no, longer, referred, to, as, aksum, as, an, extensive, and, powerful, state, though, they, had, lost, control, of, most, of, the, coast, and, their, tributaries, while, land, was, lost, in, the, north, it, was, gained, in, the, south, and, though, ethiopia, was, no, longer, an, economic, power, it, still, attracted, arab, merchants, the, capital, was, then, moved, south, to, a, new, location, called, kubar, the, arab, writer, ya, qubi, was, the, first, to, describe, the, new, aksumite, capital, the, capital, was, probably, located, in, southern, tigray, or, angot, however, the, exact, location, of, this, city, is, currently, unknown, famine, is, noted, in, ethiopia, in, the, ninth, century, the, coptic, patriarchs, james, 819, 830, and, joseph, 830, 849, of, alexandria, attribute, ethiopia, s, condition, to, war, plague, and, inadequate, rains, under, the, reign, of, degna, djan, during, the, 9th, century, the, empire, kept, expanding, south, undertaking, missionary, activities, south, of, angot, local, history, holds, that, around, 960, a, jewish, queen, named, yodit, judith, or, gudit, defeated, the, empire, and, burned, its, churches, and, literature, while, there, is, evidence, of, churches, being, burned, and, an, invasion, around, this, time, her, existence, has, been, questioned, by, some, western, authors, gudit, sacked, aksum, by, destroying, churches, and, buildings, persecuted, christians, and, committed, christian, iconoclasm, her, origin, has, been, debated, among, scholars, some, argued, that, she, had, a, jewish, ethnicity, or, was, from, a, southern, region, according, to, one, traditional, account, she, reigned, for, forty, years, and, her, dynasty, lasted, until, 1137, ad, when, it, was, overthrown, by, mara, takla, haymanot, resulting, in, the, inception, of, the, agaw, led, zagwe, dynasty, according, to, an, oral, tradition, gudit, rose, to, power, after, she, killed, the, beta, israel, king, and, then, reigned, for, 40, years, she, brought, her, jewish, army, from, semien, mountains, and, lake, tana, to, orchestrate, the, pillage, against, aksum, and, its, countryside, she, was, determined, to, destroy, all, members, of, the, aksumite, dynasty, palaces, churches, and, monuments, in, tigray, her, notorious, deeds, are, still, recounted, by, peasants, inhabiting, northern, ethiopia, large, ruins, standing, stones, and, stelae, are, found, in, the, area, gudit, also, killed, the, last, emperor, of, aksum, possibly, dil, na, od, while, other, accounts, say, dil, na, od, went, into, exile, in, shewa, protected, by, christians, he, begged, assistance, from, a, nubian, greek, ruler, king, moses, georgios, but, remained, unanswered, she, was, said, to, have, been, succeeded, by, dagna, jan, whose, throne, name, was, anbasa, wudem, her, reign, was, marked, by, the, displacement, of, the, aksumite, population, into, the, south, according, to, one, ethiopian, traditional, account, she, reigned, for, forty, years, and, her, dynasty, was, eventually, overthrown, by, mara, tekla, haymanot, in, 1137, ad, who, ushered, in, the, formation, of, the, zagwe, dynasty, by, bearing, children, with, a, descendant, of, the, last, aksumite, emperor, dil, na, od, after, a, short, dark, age, the, aksumite, empire, was, succeeded, by, the, zagwe, dynasty, in, the, 11th, or, 12th, century, most, likely, around, 1137, although, limited, in, size, and, scope, however, yekuno, amlak, who, killed, the, last, zagwe, king, and, founded, the, modern, solomonic, dynasty, around, 1270, traced, his, ancestry, and, his, right, to, rule, from, the, last, emperor, of, aksum, dil, na, od, it, should, be, mentioned, that, the, end, of, the, aksumite, empire, didn, t, mean, the, end, of, aksumite, culture, and, traditions, for, example, the, architecture, of, the, zagwe, dynasty, at, lalibela, and, yemrehana, krestos, church, shows, heavy, aksumite, influence, the, aksumite, population, mainly, consisted, of, semitic, speaking, groups, one, of, these, groups, were, the, ag, azian, or, the, speakers, of, ge, ez, the, commenter, of, the, adulis, inscription, identifies, them, as, the, main, inhabitants, of, aksum, and, its, surroundings, the, cushitic, speaking, agaw, people, were, also, known, to, have, lived, within, the, kingdom, as, cosmas, indicopleustes, notes, that, a, governor, of, agau, was, entrusted, by, king, kaleb, of, axum, with, the, protection, of, the, vital, long, distance, caravan, routes, from, the, south, suggesting, that, they, lived, within, the, southern, frontier, of, the, aksumite, kingdom, aksum, also, had, a, sizeable, ethiopian, greek, population, which, resided, in, the, cities, of, ptolemais, theron, and, adulis, nilotic, groups, also, inhabited, aksum, as, inscriptions, from, the, time, of, ezana, note, the, barya, an, animist, tribe, who, lived, in, the, western, part, of, the, empire, believed, to, be, the, naras, aksumite, settlements, were, distributed, across, a, significant, portion, of, the, highlands, in, the, northern, horn, of, africa, with, the, majority, located, in, northeastern, tigray, ethiopia, as, well, as, the, akele, guzai, and, seraye, regions, of, eritrea, despite, the, concentration, in, these, areas, some, aksumite, settlements, such, as, tchika, beret, are, located, as, far, as, south, wollo, in, addition, to, the, highlands, sites, from, the, aksumite, period, were, discovered, along, the, red, sea, coast, of, eritrea, near, the, gulf, of, zula, numerous, aksumite, settlements, were, strategically, positioned, along, an, axis, that, traversed, from, aksum, to, the, gulf, of, zula, forming, a, route, connecting, the, aksumite, capital, in, the, highlands, to, the, principal, aksumite, port, of, adulis, on, the, red, sea, along, this, route, two, of, the, largest, aksumite, era, settlements, matara, and, qohaito, were, situated, in, the, eritrean, highlands, the, concertation, of, these, aksumite, ancient, settlements, suggests, high, population, density, in, the, highlands, of, tigray, and, central, eritrea, according, to, taddesse, tamrat, the, integral, regions, of, the, aksumite, kingdom, included, much, of, the, province, of, tigre, the, whole, of, the, eritrean, plateau, and, the, regions, of, wag, lasta, and, angot, a, complex, agricultural, system, in, the, aksumite, area, which, involved, irrigation, dam, construction, terracing, and, plough, farming, played, a, crucial, role, in, sustaining, both, urban, and, rural, populations, aksumite, farmers, cultivated, a, variety, of, cereal, crops, with, origins, from, both, africa, and, the, near, east, these, crops, included, teff, finger, millet, sorghum, emmer, wheat, bread, wheat, hulled, barley, and, oats, in, addition, to, cereal, crops, aksumite, farmers, also, grew, linseed, cotton, grapes, and, legumes, of, near, eastern, origin, such, as, lentils, fava, beans, chickpeas, common, peas, and, grass, peas, other, important, crops, included, the, african, oil, crop, guizotia, abyssinica, as, well, as, gourds, and, cress, this, diverse, range, of, crops, combined, with, the, herding, of, domesticated, cattle, sheep, and, goats, contributed, to, the, creation, of, a, highly, productive, indigenous, agropastoral, food, producing, tradition, this, tradition, played, an, integral, role, in, the, development, of, the, aksumite, economy, and, the, consolidation, of, state, power, the, empire, of, aksum, is, notable, for, a, number, of, achievements, such, as, its, own, alphabet, the, ge, ez,

emperors, and, nobles, tombs, underground, grave, chambers, were, constructed, the, most, famous, of, which, is, the, obelisk, of, aksum, under, emperor, ezana, aksum, adopted, coptic, christianity, in, place, of, its, former, polytheistic, and, judaic, religions, around, 325, the, axumite, coptic, church, gave, rise, to, the, present, day, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, only, granted, autonomy, from, the, coptic, church, in, 1959, and, eritrean, orthodox, tewahdo, church, granted, autonomy, from, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, in, 1993, since, the, schism, with, orthodoxy, following, the, council, of, chalcedon, 451, it, has, been, an, important, miaphysite, church, and, its, scriptures, and, liturgy, continue, to, be, in, ge, ez, greek, became, the, official, and, literary, language, of, the, axumite, state, coming, from, the, influence, of, the, significant, ethiopian, greek, communities, established, in, axum, the, port, of, adulis, ptolemais, theron, and, other, cities, in, the, region, during, ptolemaic, times, greek, was, used, in, the, state, s, administration, international, diplomacy, and, trade, it, can, be, widely, seen, in, coinage, and, inscriptions, ge, ez, the, language, of, ag, azi, was, spoken, alongside, greek, in, the, court, of, aksum, although, during, the, early, kingdom, ge, ez, was, a, spoken, language, it, has, attestations, written, in, the, old, south, arabian, language, sabaic, in, the, 4th, century, ezana, of, axum, promoted, the, ge, ez, script, and, made, ge, ez, an, official, state, language, alongside, greek, by, the, 6th, century, literary, translations, into, ge, ez, were, common, after, the, 7th, century, s, muslim, conquests, in, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, which, effectively, isolated, axum, from, the, greco, roman, world, ge, ez, replaced, greek, entirely, before, its, conversion, to, christianity, the, aksumites, practiced, a, polytheistic, religion, related, to, the, religion, practiced, in, southern, arabia, this, included, the, use, of, the, crescent, and, disc, symbol, used, in, southern, arabia, and, the, northern, horn, in, the, unesco, sponsored, general, history, of, africa, french, archaeologist, francis, anfray, suggests, that, the, aksumites, worshipped, astar, his, son, mahrem, and, beher, steve, kaplan, argues, that, with, aksumite, culture, came, a, major, change, in, religion, with, only, astar, remaining, of, the, old, gods, the, others, being, replaced, by, what, he, calls, a, triad, of, indigenous, divinities, mahrem, beher, and, medr, he, also, suggests, that, aksum, culture, was, significantly, influenced, by, judaism, saying, that, the, first, carriers, of, judaism, reached, ethiopia, between, the, reign, of, queen, of, sheba, bc, and, conversion, to, christianity, of, king, ezana, in, the, fourth, century, ad, he, believes, that, although, ethiopian, tradition, suggests, that, these, were, present, in, large, numbers, that, a, relatively, small, number, of, texts, and, individuals, dwelling, in, the, cultural, economic, and, political, center, could, have, had, a, considerable, impact, and, that, their, influence, was, diffused, throughout, ethiopian, culture, in, its, formative, period, by, the, time, christianity, took, hold, in, the, fourth, century, many, of, the, originally, hebraic, jewish, elements, had, been, adopted, by, much, of, the, indigenous, population, and, were, no, longer, viewed, as, foreign, characteristics, nor, were, they, perceived, as, in, conflict, with, the, acceptance, of, christianity, before, converting, to, christianity, king, ezana, ii, s, coins, and, inscriptions, show, that, he, might, have, worshiped, the, gods, astar, beher, meder, medr, and, mahrem, another, of, ezana, s, inscriptions, is, clearly, christian, and, refers, to, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, around, 324, ad, the, king, ezana, ii, was, converted, to, christianity, by, his, teacher, frumentius, who, established, the, axumite, coptic, church, which, later, became, the, modern, ethiopian, orthodox, church, frumentius, taught, the, emperor, while, he, was, young, and, it, is, believed, that, at, some, point, staged, the, conversion, of, the, empire, we, know, that, the, aksumites, converted, to, christianity, because, in, their, coins, they, replaced, the, disc, and, crescent, with, the, cross, frumentius, was, in, contact, with, the, church, of, alexandria, and, was, appointed, bishop, of, ethiopia, around, the, year, 330, the, church, of, alexandria, never, closely, managed, the, affairs, of, the, churches, in, aksum, allowing, them, to, develop, their, own, unique, form, of, christianity, however, the, church, of, alexandria, probably, did, retain, some, influence, considering, that, the, churches, of, aksum, followed, the, church, of, alexandria, into, oriental, orthodoxy, by, rejecting, the, fourth, ecumenical, council, of, chalcedon, aksum, is, also, the, alleged, home, of, the, holy, relic, the, ark, of, the, covenant, the, ark, is, said, to, have, been, placed, in, the, church, of, our, lady, mary, of, zion, by, menelik, i, for, safekeeping, islam, came, in, the, 7th, century, at, the, reign, of, ashama, ibn, abjar, when, the, first, followers, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, also, known, as, the, sahabah, migrated, from, arabia, due, to, their, persecution, by, the, quraysh, the, ruling, arab, tribal, confederation, of, mecca, the, quraysh, appealed, to, the, ashama, ibn, abjar, arguing, that, the, early, muslim, migrants, were, rebels, who, had, invented, a, new, religion, the, likes, of, which, neither, the, meccans, nor, the, aksumites, had, heard, of, the, king, granted, them, an, audience, but, ultimately, refused, to, hand, over, the, migrants, a, second, migration, consisting, of, 100, muslim, migrants, occurred, a, few, years, later, arabic, inscriptions, on, the, dahlak, archipelago, dated, to, the, mid, 9th, century, ad, confirm, the, existence, of, an, early, muslim, presence, in, aksum, the, empire, of, aksum, was, one, of, the, first, african, polities, to, issue, its, own, coins, which, bore, legends, in, ge, ez, and, greek, from, the, reign, of, endubis, up, to, armah, approximately, 270, to, 610, gold, silver, and, bronze, coins, were, minted, issuing, coinage, in, ancient, times, was, an, act, of, great, importance, in, itself, for, it, proclaimed, that, the, aksumite, empire, considered, itself, equal, to, its, neighbours, many, of, the, coins, are, used, as, signposts, about, what, was, happening, when, they, were, minted, an, example, being, the, addition, of, the, cross, to, the, coin, after, the, conversion, of, the, empire, to, christianity, the, presence, of, coins, also, simplified, trade, and, was, at, once, a, useful, instrument, of, propaganda, and, a, source, of, profit, to, the, empire, in, general, elite, aksumite, buildings, such, as, palaces, were, constructed, atop, podia, built, of, loose, stones, held, together, with, mud, mortar, with, carefully, cut, granite, corner, blocks, which, rebated, back, a, few, centimeters, at, regular, intervals, as, the, wall, got, higher, so, the, walls, narrowed, as, they, rose, higher, these, podia, are, often, all, that, survive, of, aksumite, ruins, above, the, podia, walls, were, generally, built, with, alternating, layers, of, loose, stone, often, whitewashed, like, at, yemrehana, krestos, church, and, horizontal, wooden, beams, with, smaller, round, wooden, beams, set, in, the, stonework, often, projecting, out, of, the, walls, these, are, called, monkey, heads, on, the, exterior, and, sometimes, the, interior, both, the, podia, and, the, walls, above, exhibited, no, long, straight, stretches, but, were, indented, at, regular, intervals, so, that, any, long, walls, consisted, of, a, series, of, recesses, and, salients, this, helped, to, strengthen, the, walls, worked, granite, was, used, for, architectural, features, including, columns, bases, capitals, doors, windows, paving, water, spouts, often, shaped, like, lion, heads, and, so, on, as, well, as, enormous, flights, of, stairs, that, often, flanked, the, walls, of, palace, pavilions, on, several, sides, doors, and, windows, were, usually, framed, by, stone, or, wooden, cross, members, linked, at, the, corners, by, square, monkey, heads, though, simple, lintels, were, also, used, many, of, these, aksumite, features, are, seen, carved, into, the, famous, stelae, as, well, as, in, the, later, rock, hewn, churches, of, tigray, and, lalibela, palaces, usually, consisted, of, a, central, pavilion, surrounded, by, subsidiary, structures, pierced, by, doors, and, gates, that, provided, some, privacy, see, dungur, for, an, example, the, largest, of, these, structures, now, known, is, the, ta, akha, maryam, which, measured, 120, 80m, though, as, its, pavilion, was, smaller, than, others, discovered, it, is, likely, that, others, were, even, larger, some, clay, models, of, houses, survive, to, give, us, an, idea, of, what, smaller, dwellings, were, like, one, depicts, a, round, hut, with, a, conical, roof, thatched, in, layers, while, another, depicts, a, rectangular, house, with, rectangular, doors, and, windows, a, roof, supported, by, beams, that, end, in, monkey, heads, and, a, parapet, and, water, spout, on, the, roof, both, were, found, in, hawelti, another, depicts, a, square, house, with, what, appear, to, be, layers, of, pitched, thatch, forming, the, roof, the, stelae, are, perhaps, the, most, identifiable, part, of, the, aksumite, architectural, legacy, these, stone, towers, served, to, mark, graves, and, represent, a, magnificent, multi, storied, palace, they, are, decorated, with, false, doors, and, windows, in, typical, aksumite, design, the, largest, of, these, towering, obelisks, would, measure, 33, meters, high, had, it, not, fractured, the, stelae, have, most, of, their, mass, out, of, the, ground, but, are, stabilized, by, massive, underground, counter, weights, the, stone, was, often, engraved, with, a, pattern, or, emblem, denoting, the, king, s, or, the, noble, s, rank, for, important, monuments, built, in, the, region, a, particular, type, of, granite, is, used, called, nepheline, syenite, it, is, fine, grained, and, has, also, been, used, in, historic, monuments, like, the, stelae, these, monuments, are, used, to, celebrate, key, figures, in, axum, history, especially, kings, or, priests, these, stelae, s, are, also, called, obelisk, s, they, are, located, in, the, mai, hejja, stelae, field, where, complex, sedimentology, of, the, land, can, be, observed, the, foundations, for, the, monuments, are, around, 8, 5, m, below, the, surface, of, the, mai, hejja, stelae, field, sediments, in, this, area, have, undergone, a, lot, of, weathering, over, the, years, so, the, surface, of, this, area, has, undergone, a, lot, of, changes, this, is, part, of, the, reason, for, the, complex, stratigraphic, history, in, this, site, some, previous, layers, under, the, surface, of, the, site, covering, parts, of, what, is, now, northern, ethiopia, and, southern, and, eastern, eritrea, aksum, was, deeply, involved, in, the, trade, network, between, the, indian, subcontinent, and, the, mediterranean, rome, later, byzantium, exporting, ivory, tortoise, shell, gold, and, emeralds, and, importing, silk, and, spices, aksum, s, access, to, both, the, red, sea, and, the, upper, nile, enabled, its, strong, navy, to, profit, in, trade, between, various, african, nubia, arabian, yemen, and, indian, states, the, main, exports, of, aksum, were, as, would, be, expected, of, a, state, during, this, time, agricultural, products, the, land, was, much, more, fertile, during, the, time, of, the, aksumites, than, now, and, their, principal, crops, were, grains, such, as, wheat, barley, and, teff, the, people, of, aksum, also, raised, cattle, sheep, and, camels, wild, animals, were, also, hunted, for, things, such, as, ivory, and, rhinoceros, horns, they, traded, with, roman, traders, as, well, as, with, egyptian, and, persian, merchants, the, empire, was, also, rich, with, gold, and, iron, deposits, these, metals, were, valuable, to, trade, but, another, mineral, was, also, widely, traded, salt, salt, was, abundant, in, aksum, and, was, traded, quite, frequently, it, benefited, from, a, major, transformation, of, the, maritime, trading, system, that, linked, the, roman, empire, and, india, this, change, took, place, around, the, start, of, the, 1st, century, the, older, trading, system, involved, coastal, sailing, and, many, intermediary, ports, the, red, sea, was, of, secondary, importance, to, the, persian, gulf, and, overland, connections, to, the, levant, starting, around, 1st, century, a, route, from, egypt, to, india, was, established, making, use, of, the, red, sea, and, using, monsoon, winds, to, cross, the, arabian, sea, directly, to, southern, india, by, about, 100, ad, the, volume, of, traffic, being, shipped, on, this, route, had, eclipsed, older, routes, roman, demand, for, goods, from, southern, india, increased, dramatically, resulting, in, greater, number, of, large, ships, sailing, down, the, red, sea, from, roman, egypt, to, the, arabian, sea, and, india, although, excavations, have, been, limited, fourteen, roman, coins, dating, to, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, have, been, discovered, at, aksumite, sites, like, matara, this, suggests, that, trade, with, the, roman, empire, existed, at, least, since, this, period, in, 525, ad, the, aksumites, attempted, to, take, over, the, yemen, region, to, gain, control, over, the, straits, of, bab, el, mandeb, one, of, the, most, significant, trading, routes, in, the, medieval, world, connecting, the, red, sea, to, the, indian, ocean, rulers, were, inclined, to, establish, a, spot, of, imperialism, across, the, red, sea, in, yemen, to, completely, control, the, trading, vessels, that, ran, down, the, straits, of, bab, el, mandeb, it, is, located, in, the, maritime, choke, point, between, yemen, and, djibouti, and, eritrea, because, of, the, ruler, of, yemen, s, persecution, of, christians, in, 523, ad, kaleb, i, the, ruler, of, aksum, a, christian, region, at, the, time, responded, to, the, persecutions, by, attacking, the, himyarite, king, y, suf, as, ar, yath, ar, known, as, dhu, nuwas, a, jewish, convert, who, was, persecuting, the, christian, community, of, najran, yemen, in, 525, ad, with, the, help, of, the, byzantine, empire, with, whom, had, ties, with, his, kingdom, victoriously, the, aksum, empire, was, able, to, claim, the, yemen, region, establishing, a, viceroy, in, the, region, and, troops, to, defend, it, until, 570, ad, when, the, sassanids, invaded, the, kingdom, of, aksum, was, ideally, located, to, take, advantage, of, the, new, trading, situation, adulis, soon, became, the, main, port, for, the, export, of, african, goods, such, as, ivory, incense, gold, slaves, and, exotic, animals, in, order, to, supply, such, goods, the, kings, of, aksum, worked, to, develop, and, expand, an, inland, trading, network, a, rival, and, much, older, trading, network, that, tapped, the, same, interior, region, of, africa, was, that, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, which, had, long, supplied, egypt, with, african, goods, via, the, nile, corridor, by, the, 1st, century, ad, however, aksum, had, gained, control, over, territory, previously, kushite, the, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, explicitly, describes, how, ivory, collected, in, kushite, territory, was, being, exported, through, the, port, of, adulis, instead, of, being, taken, to, mero, the, capital, of, kush, during, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, ad, the, kingdom, of, aksum, continued, to, expand, their, control, of, the, southern, red, sea, basin, a, caravan, route, to, egypt, was, established, which, bypassed, the, nile, corridor, entirely, aksum, succeeded, in, becoming, the, principal, supplier, of, african, goods, to, the, roman, empire, not, least, as, a, result, of, the, transformed, indian, ocean, trading, system, climate, change, and, trade, isolation, have, also, been, claimed, as, large, reasons, for, the, decline, of, the, culture, the, local, subsistence, base, was, substantially, augmented, by, a, climatic, shift, during, the, 1st, century, ad, that, reinforced, the, spring, rains, extended, the, rainy, season, from, 3, 1, 2, to, six, or, seven, months, vastly, improved, the, surface, and, subsurface, water, supply, doubled, the, length, of, the, growing, season, and, created, an, environment, comparable, to, that, of, modern, central, ethiopia, where, two, crops, can, be, grown, per, annum, without, the, aid, of, irrigation, askum, was, also, located, on, a, plateau, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, feet, above, sea, level, making, its, soil, fertile, and, the, land, good, for, agriculture, this, appears, to, explain, how, one, of, the, marginal, agricultural, environments, of, ethiopia, was, able, to, support, the, demographic, base, that, made, this, far, flung, commercial, empire, possible, it, may, also, explain, why, no, aksumite, rural, settlement, expansion, into, the, moister, more, fertile, and, naturally, productive, lands, of, begemder, or, lasta, can, be, verified, during, the, heyday, of, aksumite, power, as, international, profits, from, the, exchange, network, declined, aksum, lost, control, over, its, raw, material, sources, and, that, network, collapsed, the, persistent, environmental, pressure, on, a, large, population, needing, to, maintain, a, high, level, of, regional, food, production, intensified, which, resulted, in, a, wave, of, soil, erosion, that, began, on, a, local, scale, c, 650, and, reached, crisis, levels, after, 700, additional, socioeconomic, contingencies, presumably, compounded, the, problem, these, are, traditionally, reflected, in, a, decline, in, maintenance, the, deterioration, and, partial, abandonment, of, marginal, crop, lands, shifts, toward, more, destructive, exploitation, of, pasture, land, and, ultimately, wholesale, irreversible, land, degradation, this, decline, was, possibly, accelerated, by, an, apparent, decline, in, the, reliability, of, rainfall, beginning, between, 730, and, 760, presumably, with, the, result, that, an, abbreviated, modern, growing, season, was, reestablished, during, the, 9th, century, 495, the, aksumite, empire, is, portrayed, as, the, main, ally, of, byzantium, in, the, belisarius, series, by, david, drake, and, eric, flint, published, by, baen, books, the, series, takes, place, during, the, reign, of, kaleb, who, in, the, series, was, assassinated, by, the, malwa, in, 532, at, the, ta, akha, maryam, and, succeeded, by, his, youngest, son, eon, bisi, dakuen, in, the, elizabeth, wein, series, the, lion, hunters, mordred, and, his, family, take, refuge, in, aksum, after, the, fall, of, camelot, kaleb, is, the, ruler, in, the, first, book, he, passes, his,
