the, fertile, crescent, arabic, is, a, crescent, shaped, region, in, the, middle, east, spanning, modern, day, iraq, israel, jordan, lebanon, palestine, and, syria, together, with, northern, kuwait, south, eastern, turkey, and, western, iran, some, authors, also, include, cyprus, and, northern, egypt, the, fertile, crescent, is, believed, to, be, the, first, region, where, settled, farming, emerged, as, people, started, the, process, of, clearance, and, modification, of, natural, vegetation, to, grow, newly, domesticated, plants, as, crops, early, human, civilizations, such, as, sumer, in, mesopotamia, flourished, as, a, result, technological, advances, in, the, region, include, the, development, of, agriculture, and, the, use, of, irrigation, of, writing, the, wheel, and, glass, most, emerging, first, in, mesopotamia, the, term, fertile, crescent, was, popularized, by, archaeologist, james, henry, breasted, in, outlines, of, european, history, 1914, and, ancient, times, a, history, of, the, early, world, 1916, he, wrote, it, lies, like, an, army, facing, south, with, one, wing, stretching, along, the, eastern, shore, of, the, mediterranean, and, the, other, reaching, out, to, the, persian, gulf, while, the, center, has, its, back, against, the, northern, mountains, the, end, of, the, western, wing, is, palestine, assyria, makes, up, a, large, part, of, the, center, while, the, end, of, the, eastern, wing, is, babylonia, this, great, semicircle, for, lack, of, a, name, may, be, called, the, fertile, crescent, there, is, no, single, term, for, this, region, in, antiquity, at, the, time, that, breasted, was, writing, it, roughly, corresponded, with, the, territories, of, the, ottoman, empire, ceded, to, britain, and, france, in, the, sykes, picot, agreement, historian, thomas, scheffler, has, noted, that, breasted, was, following, a, trend, in, western, geography, to, overwrite, the, classical, geographical, distinctions, between, continents, countries, and, landscapes, with, large, abstract, spaces, drawing, parallels, with, the, work, of, halford, mackinder, who, conceptualised, eurasia, as, a, pivot, area, surrounded, by, an, inner, crescent, alfred, thayer, mahan, s, middle, east, and, friedrich, naumann, s, mitteleuropa, in, current, usage, the, fertile, crescent, includes, israel, palestine, iraq, syria, lebanon, egypt, and, jordan, as, well, as, the, surrounding, portions, of, turkey, and, iran, in, addition, to, the, tigris, and, euphrates, riverwater, sources, include, the, jordan, river, the, inner, boundary, is, delimited, by, the, dry, climate, of, the, syrian, desert, to, the, south, around, the, outer, boundary, are, the, anatolian, and, armenian, highlands, to, the, north, the, sahara, desert, to, the, west, sudan, to, the, south, and, the, iranian, plateau, to, the, east, as, crucial, as, rivers, and, marshlands, were, to, the, rise, of, civilization, in, the, fertile, crescent, they, were, not, the, only, factor, the, area, is, geographically, important, as, the, bridge, between, north, africa, and, eurasia, which, has, allowed, it, to, retain, a, greater, amount, of, biodiversity, than, either, europe, or, north, africa, where, climate, changes, during, the, ice, age, led, to, repeated, extinction, events, when, ecosystems, became, squeezed, against, the, waters, of, the, mediterranean, sea, the, saharan, pump, theory, posits, that, this, middle, eastern, land, bridge, was, extremely, important, to, the, modern, distribution, of, old, world, flora, and, fauna, including, the, spread, of, humanity, the, area, has, borne, the, brunt, of, the, tectonic, divergence, between, the, african, and, arabian, plates, and, the, converging, arabian, and, eurasian, plates, which, has, made, the, region, a, very, diverse, zone, of, high, snow, covered, mountains, the, fertile, crescent, had, many, diverse, climates, and, major, climatic, changes, encouraged, the, evolution, of, many, r, type, annual, plants, which, produce, more, edible, seeds, than, k, type, perennial, plants, the, region, s, dramatic, variety, in, elevation, gave, rise, to, many, species, of, edible, plants, for, early, experiments, in, cultivation, most, importantly, the, fertile, crescent, was, home, to, the, eight, neolithic, founder, crops, important, in, early, agriculture, i, e, wild, progenitors, to, emmer, wheat, einkorn, barley, flax, chick, pea, pea, lentil, bitter, vetch, and, four, of, the, five, most, important, species, of, domesticated, animals, cows, goats, sheep, and, pigs, the, fifth, species, the, horse, lived, nearby, the, fertile, crescent, flora, comprises, a, high, percentage, of, plants, that, can, self, pollinate, but, may, also, be, cross, pollinated, these, plants, called, selfers, were, one, of, the, geographical, advantages, of, the, area, because, they, did, not, depend, on, other, plants, for, reproduction, as, well, as, possessing, many, sites, with, the, skeletal, and, cultural, remains, of, both, pre, modern, and, early, modern, humans, e, g, at, tabun, and, es, skhul, caves, later, pleistocene, hunter, gatherers, and, epipalaeolithic, semi, sedentary, hunter, gatherers, the, natufians, the, fertile, crescent, is, most, famous, for, its, sites, related, to, the, origins, of, agriculture, the, western, zone, around, the, jordan, and, upper, euphrates, rivers, gave, rise, to, the, first, known, neolithic, farming, settlements, referred, to, as, pre, pottery, neolithic, a, ppna, which, date, to, around, 9, 000, bce, and, includes, very, ancient, sites, such, as, g, bekli, tepe, chogha, golan, and, jericho, tell, es, sultan, this, region, alongside, mesopotamia, greek, for, between, rivers, between, the, rivers, tigris, and, euphrates, lies, in, the, east, of, the, fertile, crescent, also, saw, the, emergence, of, early, complex, societies, during, the, succeeding, bronze, age, there, is, also, early, evidence, from, the, region, for, writing, and, the, formation, of, hierarchical, state, level, societies, this, has, earned, the, region, the, nickname, the, cradle, of, civilization, it, is, in, this, region, where, the, first, libraries, appeared, about, 4, 500, years, ago, the, oldest, known, libraries, are, found, in, nippur, in, sumer, and, ebla, in, syria, both, from, c, 2500, bce, both, the, tigris, and, euphrates, start, in, the, taurus, mountains, of, what, is, modern, day, turkey, farmers, in, southern, mesopotamia, had, to, protect, their, fields, from, flooding, each, year, northern, mesopotamia, had, sufficient, rain, to, make, some, farming, possible, to, protect, against, flooding, they, made, levees, since, the, bronze, age, the, region, s, natural, fertility, has, been, greatly, extended, by, irrigation, works, upon, which, much, of, its, agricultural, production, continues, to, depend, the, last, two, millennia, have, seen, repeated, cycles, of, decline, and, recovery, as, past, works, have, fallen, into, disrepair, through, the, replacement, of, states, to, be, replaced, under, their, successors, another, ongoing, problem, has, been, salination, gradual, concentration, of, salt, and, other, minerals, in, soils, with, a, long, history, of, irrigation, prehistoric, seedless, figs, were, discovered, at, gilgal, i, in, the, jordan, valley, suggesting, that, fig, trees, were, being, planted, some, 11, 400, years, ago, cereals, were, already, grown, in, syria, as, long, as, 9, 000, years, ago, small, cats, felis, silvestris, also, were, domesticated, in, this, region, also, legumes, including, peas, lentils, and, chickpea, were, domesticated, in, this, region, domesticated, animals, include, the, cattle, sheep, goat, domestic, pig, cat, and, domestic, goose, mesopotamia, egypt, iran, anatolia, the, levant, arabia, cosmology, modern, analyses, comparing, 24, craniofacial, measurements, reveal, a, relatively, diverse, population, within, the, pre, neolithic, neolithic, and, bronze, age, fertile, crescent, supporting, the, view, that, several, populations, occupied, this, region, during, these, time, periods, similar, arguments, do, not, hold, true, for, the, basques, and, canary, islanders, of, the, same, time, period, as, the, studies, demonstrate, those, ancient, peoples, to, be, clearly, associated, with, modern, europeans, additionally, no, evidence, from, the, studies, demonstrates, cro, magnon, influence, contrary, to, former, suggestions, the, studies, further, suggest, a, diffusion, of, this, diverse, population, away, from, the, fertile, crescent, with, the, early, migrants, moving, away, from, the, near, east, westward, into, europe, and, north, africa, northward, to, crimea, and, northeastward, to, mongolia, they, took, their, agricultural, practices, with, them, and, interbred, with, the, hunter, gatherers, whom, they, subsequently, came, in, contact, with, while, perpetuating, their, farming, practices, this, supports, prior, genetic, and, archaeological, studies, which, have, all, arrived, at, the, same, conclusion, consequently, contemporary, in, situ, peoples, absorbed, the, agricultural, way, of, life, of, those, early, migrants, who, ventured, out, of, the, fertile, crescent, this, is, contrary, to, the, suggestion, that, the, spread, of, agriculture, disseminated, out, of, the, fertile, crescent, by, way, of, sharing, of, knowledge, instead, the, view, now, supported, by, a, preponderance, of, evidence, is, that, it, occurred, by, actual, migration, out, of, the, region, coupled, with, subsequent, interbreeding, with, indigenous, local, populations, whom, the, migrants, came, in, contact, with, the, studies, show, also, that, not, all, present, day, europeans, share, strong, genetic, affinities, to, the, neolithic, and, bronze, age, inhabitants, of, the, fertile, crescent, the, closest, ties, to, the, fertile, crescent, rest, with, southern, europeans, the, same, study, further, demonstrates, all, present, day, europeans, to, be, closely, related, linguistically, the, fertile, crescent, was, a, region, of, great, diversity, historically, semitic, languages, generally, prevailed, in, the, modern, regions, of, iraq, syria, jordan, lebanon, israel, palestine, sinai, and, the, fringes, of, southeast, turkey, and, northwest, iran, as, well, as, the, sumerian, a, language, isolate, in, iraq, whilst, in, the, mountainous, areas, to, the, east, and, north, a, number, of, generally, unrelated, language, isolates, were, found, including, elamite, gutian, and, kassite, in, iran, and, hattic, kaskian, and, hurro, urartian, in, turkey, the, precise, affiliation, of, these, and, their, date, of, arrival, remain, topics, of, scholarly, discussion, however, given, lack, of, textual, evidence, for, the, earliest, era, of, prehistory, this, debate, is, unlikely, to, be, resolved, in, the, near, future, the, evidence, that, does, exist, suggests, that, by, the, third, millennium, bce, and, into, the, second, several, language, groups, already, existed, in, the, region, these, included, links, between, hurro, urartian, and, hattic, and, the, indigenous, languages, of, the, caucasus, have, frequently, been, suggested, but, are, not, generally, accepted, 36, n, 40, e, 36, n, 40, e, 36, 40
