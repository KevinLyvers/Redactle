https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League
the, hanseatic, league, was, a, medieval, commercial, and, defensive, network, of, merchant, guilds, and, market, towns, in, central, and, northern, europe, growing, from, a, few, north, german, towns, in, the, late, 12th, century, the, league, expanded, between, the, 13th, and, 15th, centuries, and, ultimately, encompassed, nearly, 200, settlements, across, eight, modern, day, countries, ranging, from, estonia, in, the, north, and, east, to, the, netherlands, in, the, west, and, extended, inland, as, far, as, cologne, the, prussian, regions, and, krak, w, poland, the, league, began, as, a, collection, of, loosely, associated, groups, of, german, traders, and, towns, aiming, to, expand, their, commercial, interests, including, protection, against, robbery, over, time, these, arrangements, evolved, into, the, league, offering, traders, toll, privileges, and, protection, on, affiliated, territory, and, trade, routes, economic, interdependence, and, familial, connections, among, merchant, families, led, to, deeper, political, integration, and, the, reduction, of, trade, barriers, this, gradual, process, involved, standardizing, trade, regulations, among, hanseatic, cities, during, its, time, the, hanseatic, league, dominated, maritime, trade, in, the, north, and, baltic, seas, it, established, a, network, of, trading, posts, in, numerous, towns, and, cities, notably, the, kontors, in, london, known, as, the, steelyard, bruges, bergen, and, novgorod, which, became, extraterritorial, entities, that, enjoyed, considerable, legal, autonomy, hanseatic, merchants, commonly, referred, to, as, hansards, operated, private, companies, and, were, known, for, their, access, to, commodities, and, enjoyed, privileges, and, protections, abroad, the, league, s, economic, power, enabled, it, to, impose, blockades, and, even, wage, war, against, kingdoms, and, principalities, even, at, its, peak, the, hanseatic, league, remained, a, loosely, aligned, confederation, of, city, states, it, lacked, a, permanent, administrative, body, a, treasury, and, a, standing, military, force, in, the, 14th, century, the, hanseatic, league, instated, an, irregular, negotiating, diet, middle, low, german, dachvart, or, dach, german, tagfahrt, or, hansetag, that, operated, based, on, deliberation, and, consensus, by, the, mid, 16th, century, these, weak, connections, left, the, hanseatic, league, vulnerable, and, it, gradually, unraveled, as, members, merged, into, other, realms, or, departed, ultimately, disintegrating, in, 1669, the, league, used, a, variety, of, vessel, types, for, shipping, across, the, seas, and, navigating, rivers, the, most, emblematic, type, was, the, cog, expressing, diversity, in, construction, it, was, depicted, on, hanseatic, seals, and, coats, of, arms, by, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, the, cog, was, replaced, by, types, like, the, hulk, which, later, gave, way, to, larger, carvel, ships, hanse, is, the, old, high, german, word, for, a, band, or, troop, this, word, was, applied, to, bands, of, merchants, traveling, between, the, hanseatic, cities, hanse, in, middle, low, german, came, to, mean, a, society, of, merchants, or, a, trader, guild, claims, that, it, originally, meant, an, see, or, on, the, sea, are, incorrect, 145, exploratory, trading, ventures, raids, and, piracy, occurred, throughout, the, baltic, sea, the, sailors, of, gotland, sailed, up, rivers, as, far, away, as, novgorod, which, was, a, major, rus, trade, centre, scandinavians, led, the, baltic, trade, before, the, league, establishing, major, trading, hubs, at, birka, haithabu, and, schleswig, by, the, 9th, century, ce, the, later, hanseatic, ports, between, mecklenburg, and, k, nigsberg, present, day, kaliningrad, originally, formed, part, of, the, scandinavian, led, baltic, trade, system, the, hanseatic, league, was, never, formally, founded, so, it, lacks, a, date, of, foundation, 2, historians, traditionally, traced, its, origins, to, the, rebuilding, of, the, north, german, town, of, l, beck, in, 1159, by, the, powerful, henry, the, lion, duke, of, saxony, and, bavaria, after, he, had, captured, the, area, from, adolf, ii, count, of, schauenburg, and, holstein, more, recent, scholarship, has, deemphasized, l, beck, viewing, it, as, one, of, several, regional, trading, centers, and, presenting, the, league, as, the, combination, of, a, north, german, trading, system, oriented, on, the, baltic, and, a, rhinelandic, trading, system, targeting, england, and, flanders, german, cities, speedily, dominated, trade, in, the, baltic, during, the, 13th, century, and, l, beck, became, a, central, node, in, the, seaborne, trade, that, linked, the, areas, around, the, north, and, baltic, seas, l, beck, hegemony, peaked, during, the, 15th, century, well, before, the, term, hanse, appeared, in, a, document, in, 1267, in, different, cities, began, to, form, guilds, or, hansas, with, the, intention, of, trading, with, overseas, towns, especially, in, the, economically, less, developed, eastern, baltic, this, area, could, supply, timber, wax, amber, resins, and, furs, along, with, rye, and, wheat, brought, on, barges, from, the, hinterland, to, port, markets, merchant, guilds, formed, in, hometowns, and, destination, ports, as, medieval, corporations, universitates, mercatorum, 42, 43, and, despite, competition, increasingly, cooperated, to, coalesce, into, the, hanseatic, network, of, merchant, guilds, the, dominant, language, of, trade, was, middle, low, german, which, had, significant, impact, on, the, languages, spoken, in, the, area, particularly, the, larger, scandinavian, languages, 1222, 1233, 1933, 1934, estonian, 288, and, latvian, 230, 231, visby, on, the, island, of, gotland, functioned, as, the, leading, centre, in, the, baltic, before, the, hansa, sailing, east, visby, merchants, established, a, trading, post, at, novgorod, called, gutagard, also, known, as, gotenhof, in, 1080, in, 1120, gotland, gained, autonomy, from, sweden, and, admitted, traders, from, its, southern, and, western, regions, 26, thereafter, under, a, treaty, with, the, visby, hansa, northern, german, merchants, made, regular, stops, at, gotland, in, the, first, half, of, the, 13th, century, they, established, their, own, trading, station, or, kontor, in, novgorod, known, as, the, peterhof, up, the, river, volkhov, l, beck, soon, became, a, base, for, merchants, from, saxony, and, westphalia, trading, eastward, and, northward, for, them, because, of, its, shorter, and, easier, access, route, and, better, legal, protections, it, was, more, attractive, than, schleswig, 27, it, became, a, transshipment, port, for, trade, between, the, north, sea, and, the, baltics, l, beck, also, granted, extensive, trade, privileges, to, russian, and, scandinavian, traders, 27, 28, it, was, the, main, supply, port, for, the, northern, crusades, improving, its, standing, with, various, popes, l, beck, gained, imperial, privileges, to, become, a, free, imperial, city, in, 1226, under, valdemar, ii, of, denmark, during, the, danish, dominion, as, had, hamburg, in, 1189, also, in, this, period, wismar, rostock, stralsund, and, danzig, received, city, charters, 50, 52, hansa, societies, worked, to, remove, trade, restrictions, for, their, members, the, earliest, documentary, mention, although, without, a, name, of, a, specific, german, commercial, federation, dates, between, 1173, and, 1175, commonly, misdated, to, 1157, in, london, that, year, the, merchants, of, the, hansa, in, cologne, convinced, king, henry, ii, of, england, to, exempt, them, from, all, tolls, in, london, and, to, grant, protection, to, merchants, and, goods, throughout, england, 14, 17, german, colonists, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, settled, in, numerous, cities, on, and, near, the, east, baltic, coast, such, as, elbing, elbl, g, thorn, toru, reval, tallinn, riga, and, dorpat, tartu, all, of, which, joined, the, league, and, some, of, which, retain, hansa, buildings, and, bear, the, style, of, their, hanseatic, days, most, adopted, l, beck, law, after, the, league, s, most, prominent, town, the, law, provided, that, they, appeal, in, all, legal, matters, to, l, beck, s, city, council, others, like, danzig, from, 1295, onwards, had, magdeburg, law, or, its, derivative, culm, law, later, the, livonian, confederation, of, 1435, to, c, 1582, incorporated, modern, day, estonia, and, parts, of, latvia, all, of, its, major, towns, were, members, of, the, league, over, the, 13th, century, older, and, wealthier, long, distance, traders, increasingly, chose, to, settle, in, their, hometowns, as, trade, leaders, transitioning, from, their, previous, roles, as, landowners, the, growing, number, of, settled, merchants, afforded, long, distance, traders, greater, influence, over, town, policies, coupled, with, an, increased, presence, in, the, ministerial, class, this, elevated, the, status, of, merchants, and, enabled, them, expand, to, and, assert, dominance, over, more, cities, 44, 47, 50, 27, 28, this, decentralised, arrangement, was, fostered, by, slow, travel, speeds, moving, from, reval, to, l, beck, took, between, 4, weeks, and, in, winter, 4, months, 202, in, 1241, l, beck, which, had, access, to, the, baltic, and, north, seas, fishing, grounds, formed, an, alliance, a, precursor, to, the, league, with, the, trade, city, of, hamburg, which, controlled, access, to, the, salt, trade, routes, from, l, neburg, these, cities, gained, control, over, most, of, the, salt, fish, trade, especially, the, scania, market, cologne, joined, them, in, the, diet, of, 1260, the, towns, raised, their, own, armies, with, each, guild, required, to, provide, levies, when, needed, the, hanseatic, cities, aided, one, another, and, commercial, ships, often, served, to, carry, soldiers, and, their, arms, the, network, of, alliances, grew, to, include, a, flexible, roster, of, 70, to, 170, cities, in, the, west, cities, of, the, rhineland, such, as, cologne, enjoyed, trading, privileges, in, flanders, and, england, in, 1266, king, henry, iii, of, england, granted, the, l, beck, and, hamburg, hansa, a, charter, for, operations, in, england, initially, causing, competition, with, the, westphalians, but, the, cologne, hansa, and, the, wendish, hansa, joined, in, 1282, to, form, the, hanseatic, colony, in, london, although, they, didn, t, completely, merge, until, the, 15th, century, novgorod, was, blockaded, in, 1268, and, 1277, 1278, 58, 59, nonetheless, westphalian, traders, continued, to, dominate, trade, in, london, and, also, ipswich, and, colchester, while, baltic, and, wendish, traders, concentrated, between, king, s, lynn, and, newcastle, upon, tyne, 36, much, of, the, drive, for, co, operation, came, from, the, fragmented, nature, of, existing, territorial, governments, which, did, not, provide, security, for, trade, over, the, next, 50, years, the, merchant, hansa, solidified, with, formal, agreements, for, co, operation, covering, the, west, and, east, trade, routes, cities, from, the, east, modern, day, low, countries, but, also, utrecht, holland, zealand, brabant, namur, and, modern, limburg, joined, in, participation, over, the, thirteenth, century, 111, this, network, of, hanseatic, trading, guilds, became, called, the, kaufmannshanse, in, historiography, the, league, succeeded, in, establishing, additional, kontors, in, bruges, flanders, bryggen, in, bergen, norway, and, london, england, beside, the, peterhof, in, novgorod, these, trading, posts, were, institutionalised, by, the, first, half, of, the, 14th, century, for, bergen, and, bruges, 62, 65, and, except, for, the, kontor, of, bruges, became, significant, enclaves, the, london, kontor, the, steelyard, stood, west, of, london, bridge, near, upper, thames, street, on, the, site, later, occupied, by, cannon, street, station, it, grew, into, a, walled, community, with, its, own, warehouses, weigh, house, church, offices, and, homes, in, addition, to, the, major, kontors, individual, ports, with, hanseatic, trading, outposts, or, factories, had, a, representative, merchant, and, warehouse, often, they, were, not, permanently, manned, in, scania, denmark, around, 30, hanseatic, seasonal, factories, produced, salted, herring, these, were, called, vitten, and, were, granted, legal, autonomy, to, the, extent, that, burkhardt, argues, that, they, resembled, a, fifth, kontor, and, would, be, seen, as, such, if, not, for, their, early, decline, 157, 158, in, england, factories, in, boston, the, outpost, was, also, called, stalhof, bristol, bishop, s, lynn, later, king, s, lynn, which, featured, the, sole, remaining, hanseatic, warehouse, in, england, hull, ipswich, newcastle, upon, tyne, norwich, scarborough, yarmouth, now, great, yarmouth, and, york, many, of, which, were, important, for, the, baltic, trade, and, became, centres, of, the, textile, industry, in, the, late, 14th, century, hansards, and, textile, manufacturers, coordinated, to, make, fabrics, meet, local, demand, and, fashion, in, the, traders, hometowns, outposts, in, lisbon, bordeaux, bourgneuf, la, rochelle, and, nantes, offered, the, cheaper, bay, salt, ships, that, plied, this, trade, sailed, in, the, salt, fleet, trading, posts, operated, in, flanders, denmark, norway, the, baltic, interior, upper, germany, iceland, and, venice, 158, 160, hanseatic, trade, was, not, exclusively, maritime, or, even, over, water, most, hanseatic, towns, did, not, have, immediate, access, to, the, sea, and, many, were, linked, to, partners, by, river, trade, or, even, land, trade, these, formed, an, integrated, network, while, many, smaller, hanseatic, towns, had, their, main, trading, activity, in, subregional, trade, internal, hanseatic, trade, was, in, fact, the, hanse, s, quantitatively, largest, and, important, business, 153, 161, trade, over, rivers, and, land, was, not, tied, to, specific, hanseatic, privileges, but, seaports, such, as, bremen, hamburg, and, riga, dominated, trade, on, their, rivers, this, was, not, possible, for, the, rhine, where, trade, retained, an, open, character, digging, canals, for, trade, was, uncommon, although, the, stecknitz, canal, was, built, between, l, beck, and, lauenburg, from, 1391, to, 1398, 145, 147, 158, 159, starting, with, trade, in, coarse, woollen, fabrics, the, hanseatic, league, increased, both, commerce, and, industry, in, northern, germany, as, trade, increased, finer, woollen, and, linen, fabrics, and, even, silks, were, manufactured, in, northern, germany, the, same, refinement, of, products, out, of, cottage, industry, occurred, in, other, fields, e, g, etching, wood, carving, armour, production, engraving, of, metals, and, wood, turning, the, league, primarily, traded, beeswax, furs, timber, resin, or, tar, flax, honey, wheat, and, rye, from, the, east, to, flanders, and, england, with, cloth, in, particular, broadcloth, and, increasingly, manufactured, goods, going, in, the, other, direction, metal, ore, principally, copper, and, iron, and, herring, came, south, from, sweden, while, the, carpathians, were, another, important, source, of, copper, and, iron, often, sold, in, thorn, lubeck, had, a, vital, role, in, the, salt, trade, salt, was, acquired, in, l, neburg, or, shipped, from, france, and, portugal, and, sold, on, central, european, markets, taken, to, scania, to, salt, herring, or, exported, to, russia, stockfish, was, traded, from, bergen, in, exchange, for, grain, hanseatic, grain, inflows, allowed, more, permanent, settlements, further, north, in, norway, the, league, also, traded, beer, with, beer, from, hanseatic, towns, the, most, valued, and, wendish, cities, like, l, beck, hamburg, wismar, and, rostock, developed, export, breweries, for, hopped, beer, 45, 61, 35, 36, 72, 141, 207, 233, the, hanseatic, league, at, first, the, merchant, hansas, and, eventually, its, cities, relied, on, power, to, secure, protection, and, gain, and, preserve, privileges, bandits, and, pirates, were, persistent, problems, during, wars, these, could, be, joined, by, privateers, traders, could, be, arrested, abroad, and, their, goods, could, be, confiscated, the, league, sought, to, codify, protection, internal, treaties, established, mutual, defence, and, external, treaties, codified, privileges, 53, many, locals, merchant, and, noble, alike, envied, the, league, s, power, and, tried, to, diminish, it, for, example, in, london, local, merchants, exerted, continuing, pressure, for, the, revocation, of, privileges, 96, 98, most, foreign, cities, confined, hanseatic, traders, to, specific, trading, areas, and, their, trading, posts, 128, 143, the, refusal, of, the, hansa, to, offer, reciprocal, arrangements, to, their, counterparts, exacerbated, the, tension, 105, 111, league, merchants, used, their, economic, power, to, pressure, cities, and, rulers, they, called, embargoes, redirected, trade, away, from, towns, and, boycotted, entire, countries, blockades, were, erected, against, novgorod, in, 1268, and, 1277, 1278, 58, bruges, was, pressured, by, temporarily, moving, the, hanseatic, emporium, to, aardenburg, from, 1280, to, 1282, 58, 19, 21, from, 1307, or, 1308, to, 1310, 20, 21, and, in, 1350, 29, to, dordt, in, 1358, and, 1388, and, to, antwerp, in, 1436, 68, 80, 92, boycotts, against, norway, in, 1284, 28, and, flanders, in, 1358, nearly, caused, famines, 68, they, sometimes, resorted, to, military, action, several, hanseatic, cities, maintained, their, own, warships, and, in, times, of, need, repurposed, merchant, ships, military, action, against, political, powers, often, involved, an, ad, hoc, coalition, of, stakeholders, called, an, alliance, tohopesate, 32, 39, 40, 93, 95, as, an, essential, part, of, protecting, their, investments, league, members, trained, pilots, and, erected, lighthouses, including, k, pu, lighthouse, l, beck, erected, in, 1202, what, may, be, northern, europe, s, first, proper, lighthouse, in, falsterbo, by, 1600, at, least, 15, lighthouses, had, been, erected, along, the, german, and, scandinavian, coasts, making, it, the, best, lighted, coast, in, the, world, largely, thanks, to, the, hansa, the, weakening, of, imperial, power, and, imperial, protection, under, the, late, hohenstaufen, dynasty, forced, the, league, to, institutionalise, a, cooperating, network, of, cities, with, a, fluid, structure, called, the, st, dtehanse, 27, but, it, never, became, a, formal, organisation, and, the, kaufmannshanse, continued, to, exist, 28, 29, this, development, was, delayed, by, the, conquest, of, wendish, cities, by, danish, king, eric, vi, menved, or, by, their, feudal, overlords, between, 1306, and, 1319, and, the, restriction, of, their, autonomy, 60, 61, assemblies, of, the, hanse, towns, met, irregularly, in, l, beck, for, a, hansetag, hanseatic, diet, starting, either, around, 1300, 59, or, possibly, 1356, 66, many, towns, chose, not, to, attend, nor, to, send, representatives, and, decisions, were, not, binding, on, individual, cities, if, their, delegates, were, not, included, in, the, recesses, representatives, would, sometimes, leave, the, diet, prematurely, to, give, their, towns, an, excuse, not, to, ratify, decisions, 36, 39, only, a, few, hanseatic, cities, were, free, imperial, cities, or, enjoyed, comparable, autonomy, and, liberties, but, many, temporarily, escaped, domination, by, local, nobility, between, 1361, and, 1370, league, members, fought, against, denmark, in, the, danish, hanseatic, war, though, initially, unsuccessful, with, a, wendish, offensive, towns, from, prussia, and, the, netherlands, and, eventually, joined, by, wendish, towns, allied, in, the, confederation, of, cologne, in, 1368, sacked, copenhagen, and, helsingborg, and, forced, valdemar, iv, king, of, denmark, and, his, son, in, law, haakon, vi, king, of, norway, to, grant, tax, exemptions, and, influence, over, resund, fortresses, for, 15, years, in, the, peace, treaty, of, stralsund, in, 1370, it, extended, privileges, in, scania, to, the, league, including, holland, and, zeeland, the, treaty, marked, the, height, of, hanseatic, influence, for, this, period, the, league, was, called, a, northern, european, great, power, the, confederation, lasted, until, 1385, while, the, resund, fortresses, were, returned, to, denmark, that, year, 64, 70, 73, after, valdemar, s, heir, olav, died, a, succession, dispute, erupted, over, denmark, and, norway, between, albert, of, mecklenburg, king, of, sweden, and, margaret, i, queen, of, denmark, this, was, further, complicated, when, swedish, nobles, rebelled, against, albert, and, invited, margaret, albert, was, taken, prisoner, in, 1389, but, hired, privateers, in, 1392, the, socalled, victual, brothers, who, took, bornholm, and, visby, in, his, name, they, and, their, descendants, threatened, maritime, trade, between, 1392, and, the, 1430s, under, the, 1395, release, agreement, for, albert, stockholm, was, ruled, from, 1395, to, 1398, by, a, consortium, of, 7, hanseatic, cities, and, enjoyed, full, hanseatic, trading, privileges, it, went, to, margaret, in, 1398, 76, 77, the, victual, brothers, controlled, gotland, in, 1398, it, was, conquered, by, the, teutonic, order, with, support, from, the, prussian, towns, and, its, privileges, were, restored, the, grandmaster, of, the, teutonic, order, was, often, seen, as, head, of, the, hanse, caput, hansae, both, abroad, and, by, some, league, members, 77, 78, 31, 32, over, the, 15th, century, the, league, became, further, institutionalised, this, was, in, part, a, response, to, challenges, in, governance, and, competition, with, rivals, but, also, reflected, changes, in, trade, a, slow, shift, occurred, from, loose, participation, to, formal, recognition, revocation, 113, 115, another, general, trend, was, hanseatic, cities, increased, legislation, of, their, kontors, abroad, only, the, bergen, kontor, grew, more, independent, in, this, period, 136, in, novgorod, after, extended, conflict, since, the, 1380s, the, league, regained, its, trade, privileges, in, 1392, agreeing, to, russian, trade, privileges, for, livonia, and, gotland, 78, 83, in, 1424, all, german, traders, of, the, petershof, kontor, in, novgorod, were, imprisoned, and, 36, of, them, died, although, rare, arrests, and, seizures, in, novgorod, were, particularly, violent, 182, in, response, and, due, to, the, ongoing, war, between, novgorod, and, the, livonian, order, the, league, blockaded, novgorod, and, abandoned, the, peterhof, from, 1443, to, 1448, 82, after, extended, conflicts, with, the, league, from, the, 1370s, english, traders, gained, trade, privileges, in, the, prussian, region, via, the, treaties, of, marienburg, the, first, in, 1388, the, last, in, 1409, 78, 83, their, influence, increased, while, the, importance, of, hanseatic, trade, in, england, decreased, over, the, 15th, century, 98, over, the, 15th, century, tensions, between, the, prussian, region, and, the, wendish, cities, l, beck, and, its, eastern, neighbours, increased, l, beck, was, dependent, on, its, role, as, centre, of, the, hansa, prussia, s, main, interest, on, the, other, hand, was, the, export, of, bulk, products, such, as, grain, and, timber, to, england, the, low, countries, and, later, on, spain, and, italy, frederick, ii, elector, of, brandenburg, tried, to, assert, authority, over, the, hanseatic, towns, berlin, and, c, lln, in, 1442, and, blocked, all, brandenburg, towns, from, participating, in, hanseatic, diets, for, some, brandenburg, towns, this, ended, their, hanseatic, involvement, in, 1488, john, cicero, elector, of, brandenburg, did, the, same, to, stendal, and, salzwedel, in, the, altmark, 34, 35, until, 1394, holland, and, zeeland, actively, participated, in, the, hansa, but, in, 1395, their, feudal, obligations, to, albert, i, duke, of, bavaria, prevented, further, cooperation, consequently, their, hanseatic, ties, weakened, and, their, economic, focus, shifted, between, 1417, and, 1432, this, economic, reorientation, became, even, more, pronounced, as, holland, and, zeeland, gradually, became, part, of, the, burgundian, state, the, city, of, l, beck, faced, financial, troubles, in, 1403, leading, dissenting, craftsmen, to, establish, a, supervising, committee, in, 1405, this, triggered, a, governmental, crisis, in, 1408, when, the, committee, rebelled, and, established, a, new, town, council, similar, revolts, broke, out, in, wismar, and, rostock, with, new, town, councils, established, in, 1410, the, crisis, was, ended, in, 1418, by, a, compromise, 83, 88, eric, of, pomerania, succeeded, margaret, in, 1412, and, sought, to, expand, into, schleswig, and, holstein, levying, tolls, at, the, resund, hanseatic, cities, were, divided, initially, l, beck, tried, to, appease, eric, while, hamburg, supported, the, schauenburg, counts, against, him, this, led, to, the, danish, hanseatic, war, 1426, 1435, and, the, bombardment, of, copenhagen, 1428, the, treaty, of, vordingborg, renewed, the, league, s, commercial, privileges, in, 1435, but, the, resund, tolls, continued, eric, of, pomerania, was, subsequently, deposed, and, in, 1438, l, beck, took, control, of, the, resund, toll, which, caused, tensions, with, holland, and, zeeland, 89, 91, 265, 171, the, sound, tolls, and, a, later, attempt, of, l, beck, to, exclude, the, english, and, dutch, merchants, from, scania, harmed, the, scanian, herring, trade, when, the, excluded, regions, began, to, develop, their, own, herring, industries, 157, 158, in, the, dutch, hanseatic, war, 1438, 1441, a, privateer, war, mostly, waged, by, wendish, towns, the, merchants, of, amsterdam, sought, and, eventually, won, free, access, to, the, baltic, although, the, blockade, of, the, grain, trade, hurt, holland, and, zeeland, more, than, hanseatic, cities, it, was, against, prussian, interest, to, maintain, it, 91, in, 1454, the, year, of, the, marriage, of, elisabeth, of, austria, to, king, grand, duke, casimir, iv, jagiellon, of, poland, lithuania, the, towns, of, the, prussian, confederation, rose, up, against, the, dominance, of, the, teutonic, order, and, asked, casimir, iv, for, help, gda, sk, danzig, thorn, and, elbing, became, part, of, the, kingdom, of, poland, from, 1466, to, 1569, referred, to, as, royal, prussia, region, of, poland, by, the, second, peace, of, thorn, poland, in, turn, was, heavily, supported, by, the, holy, roman, empire, through, family, connections, and, by, military, assistance, under, the, habsburgs, krak, w, then, the, polish, capital, had, a, loose, association, with, the, hansa, 93, the, lack, of, customs, borders, on, the, river, vistula, after, 1466, helped, to, gradually, increase, polish, grain, exports, transported, down, the, vistula, from, 10, 000, short, tons, 9, 100, t, per, year, in, the, late, 15th, century, to, over, 200, 000, short, tons, 180, 000, t, in, the, 17th, century, the, hansa, dominated, maritime, grain, trade, made, poland, one, of, the, main, areas, of, its, activity, helping, danzig, to, become, the, hansa, s, largest, city, polish, kings, soon, began, to, reduce, the, towns, political, freedoms, 36, beginning, in, the, mid, 15th, century, the, griffin, dukes, of, pomerania, were, in, constant, conflict, over, control, of, the, pomeranian, hanseatic, towns, while, not, successful, at, first, bogislav, x, eventually, subjugated, stettin, and, k, slin, curtailing, the, region, s, economy, and, independence, 35, a, major, hansa, economic, advantage, was, its, control, of, the, shipbuilding, market, mainly, in, l, beck, and, danzig, the, league, sold, ships, throughout, europe, the, economic, crises, of, the, late, 15th, century, did, not, spare, the, hansa, nevertheless, its, eventual, rivals, emerged, in, the, form, of, territorial, states, new, vehicles, of, credit, were, imported, from, italy, when, flanders, and, holland, became, part, of, the, duchy, of, burgundy, burgund, dutch, and, prussian, cities, increasingly, excluded, l, beck, from, their, grain, trade, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, century, burgund, dutch, demand, for, prussian, and, livonian, grain, grew, in, the, late, 15th, century, these, trade, interests, differed, from, wendish, interests, threatening, political, unity, but, also, showed, a, trade, where, the, hanseatic, system, was, impractical, 198, 215, 216, hollandish, freight, costs, were, much, lower, than, the, hansa, s, and, the, hansa, were, excluded, as, middlemen, after, naval, wars, between, burgundy, and, the, hanseatic, fleets, amsterdam, gained, the, position, of, leading, port, for, polish, and, baltic, grain, from, the, late, 15th, century, onwards, nuremberg, in, franconia, developed, an, overland, route, to, sell, formerly, hansa, monopolised, products, from, frankfurt, via, nuremberg, and, leipzig, to, poland, and, russia, trading, flemish, cloth, and, french, wine, in, exchange, for, grain, and, furs, from, the, east, the, hansa, profited, from, the, nuremberg, trade, by, allowing, nurembergers, to, settle, in, hanseatic, towns, which, the, franconians, exploited, by, taking, over, trade, with, sweden, as, well, the, nuremberger, merchant, albrecht, moldenhauer, was, influential, in, developing, the, trade, with, sweden, and, norway, and, his, sons, wolf, and, burghard, moldenhauer, established, themselves, in, bergen, and, stockholm, becoming, leaders, of, the, local, hanseatic, activities, king, edward, iv, of, england, reconfirmed, the, league, s, privileges, in, the, treaty, of, utrecht, despite, the, latent, hostility, in, part, thanks, to, the, significant, financial, contribution, the, league, made, to, the, yorkist, side, during, the, wars, of, the, roses, of, 1455, 1487, 308, 309, tsar, ivan, iii, of, russia, closed, the, hanseatic, kontor, at, novgorod, in, 1494, and, deported, its, merchants, to, moscow, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, hanseatic, influence, on, russian, trade, 145, at, the, time, only, 49, traders, were, at, the, peterhof, 99, the, fur, trade, was, redirected, to, leipzig, taking, out, the, hansards, 54, while, the, hanseatic, trade, with, russia, moved, to, riga, reval, and, pleskau, 100, when, the, peterhof, reopened, in, 1514, novgorod, was, no, longer, a, trade, hub, 182, 312, in, the, same, period, the, burghers, of, bergen, tried, to, develop, an, independent, intermediate, trade, with, the, northern, population, against, the, hansards, obstruction, 144, the, league, s, mere, existence, and, its, privileges, and, monopolies, created, economic, and, social, tensions, that, often, spilled, onto, rivalries, between, league, members, the, development, of, transatlantic, trade, after, the, discovery, of, the, americas, caused, the, remaining, kontors, decline, especially, in, bruges, because, it, centred, on, other, ports, it, also, changed, business, practice, to, short, term, contracts, and, obsoleted, the, hanseatic, model, of, privileged, guaranteed, trade, 154, the, trends, of, local, feudal, lords, asserting, control, over, towns, and, suppressing, their, autonomy, and, of, foreign, rulers, repressing, hanseatic, traders, continued, in, the, next, century, in, the, swedish, war, of, liberation, 1521, 1523, the, hanseatic, league, was, successful, in, opposition, in, an, economic, conflict, it, had, over, the, trade, mining, and, metal, industry, in, bergslagen, the, main, mining, area, of, sweden, in, the, 16th, century, with, jakob, fugger, industrialist, in, the, mining, and, metal, industry, and, his, unfriendly, business, take, over, attempt, fugger, allied, with, his, financially, dependent, pope, leo, x, maximilian, i, holy, roman, emperor, and, christian, ii, of, denmark, norway, both, sides, made, costly, investments, in, support, of, mercenaries, to, win, the, war, after, the, war, gustav, vasa, s, sweden, and, frederick, i, s, denmark, pursued, independent, policies, and, didn, t, support, l, beck, s, effort, against, dutch, trade, 113, however, l, beck, under, j, rgen, wullenwever, overextended, in, the, count, s, feud, in, scania, and, denmark, and, lost, influence, in, 1536, after, christian, iii, s, victory, 144, l, beck, s, attempts, at, forcing, competitors, out, of, the, sound, eventually, alienated, even, gustav, vasa, 113, 114, its, influence, in, the, nordic, countries, began, to, decline, the, hanseatic, towns, of, guelders, were, obstructed, in, the, 1530s, by, charles, ii, duke, of, guelders, charles, a, strict, catholic, objected, to, lutheranism, in, his, words, lutheran, heresy, of, l, beck, and, other, north, german, cities, this, frustrated, but, did, not, end, the, towns, hanseatic, trade, and, a, small, resurgence, came, later, later, in, the, 16th, century, denmark, norway, took, control, of, much, of, the, baltic, sweden, had, regained, control, over, its, own, trade, the, kontor, in, novgorod, had, closed, and, the, kontor, in, bruges, had, become, effectively, moribund, because, the, zwin, inlet, was, closing, up, 132, finally, the, growing, political, authority, of, the, german, princes, constrained, the, independence, of, hanse, towns, the, league, attempted, to, deal, with, some, of, these, issues, it, created, the, post, of, syndic, in, 1556, and, elected, heinrich, sudermann, to, the, position, who, worked, to, protect, and, extend, the, diplomatic, agreements, of, the, member, towns, in, 1557, and, 1579, revised, agreements, spelled, out, the, duties, of, towns, and, some, progress, was, made, the, bruges, kontor, moved, to, antwerp, in, 1520, 140, 154, and, the, hansa, attempted, to, pioneer, new, routes, however, the, league, proved, unable, to, prevent, the, growing, mercantile, competition, in, 1567, a, hanseatic, league, agreement, reconfirmed, previous, obligations, and, rights, of, league, members, such, as, common, protection, and, defense, against, enemies, the, prussian, quartier, cities, of, thorn, elbing, k, nigsberg, and, riga, and, dorpat, also, signed, when, pressed, by, the, king, of, poland, lithuania, danzig, remained, neutral, and, would, not, allow, ships, running, for, poland, into, its, territory, they, had, to, anchor, somewhere, else, such, as, at, pautzke, puck, the, antwerp, kontor, moribund, after, the, fall, of, the, city, closed, in, 1593, in, 1597, queen, elizabeth, i, of, england, expelled, the, league, from, london, and, the, steelyard, closed, and, sequestered, in, 1598, the, kontor, returned, in, 1606, under, her, successor, james, i, but, it, could, not, recover, 341, 343, the, bergen, kontor, continued, until, 1754, of, all, the, kontore, only, its, buildings, the, bryggen, survive, not, all, states, tried, to, suppress, their, cities, former, hanseatic, links, the, dutch, republic, encouraged, its, eastern, former, members, to, maintain, ties, with, the, remaining, hanseatic, league, the, states, general, relied, on, those, cities, in, diplomacy, at, the, time, of, the, kalmar, war, 123, the, thirty, years, war, was, destructive, for, the, hanseatic, league, and, members, suffered, heavily, from, both, the, imperials, the, danes, and, the, swedes, at, the, beginning, saxon, and, wendish, faced, attacks, because, of, the, desire, of, christian, iv, of, denmark, to, control, the, elbe, and, weser, pomerania, had, a, major, population, decline, sweden, took, bremen, verden, excluding, the, city, of, bremen, swedish, pomerania, including, stralsund, greifswald, rostock, and, swedish, wismar, preventing, their, cities, from, participating, in, the, league, and, controlled, the, oder, weser, and, elbe, and, could, levy, tolls, on, their, traffic, 114, 116, the, league, became, increasingly, irrelevant, despite, its, inclusion, in, the, peace, of, westphalia, 43, in, 1666, the, steelyard, burned, in, the, great, fire, of, london, the, kontor, manager, sent, a, letter, to, l, beck, appealing, for, immediate, financial, assistance, for, a, reconstruction, hamburg, bremen, and, l, beck, called, for, a, hanseatic, day, in, 1669, only, a, few, cities, participated, and, those, who, came, were, reluctant, to, contribute, financially, to, the, reconstruction, it, was, the, last, formal, meeting, unbeknownst, to, any, of, the, parties, this, date, is, often, taken, in, retrospect, as, the, effective, end, date, of, the, hansa, but, the, league, never, formally, disbanded, it, silently, disintegrated, 192, 2, the, hanseatic, league, however, lived, on, in, the, public, mind, leopold, i, even, requested, l, beck, to, call, a, tagfahrt, to, rally, support, for, him, against, the, turks, 192, l, beck, hamburg, and, bremen, continued, to, attempt, common, diplomacy, although, interests, had, diverged, by, the, peace, of, ryswick, 192, nonetheless, the, hanseatic, republics, were, able, to, jointly, perform, some, diplomacy, such, as, a, joint, delegation, to, the, united, states, in, 1827, led, by, vincent, rumpff, later, the, united, states, established, a, consulate, to, the, hanseatic, and, free, cities, from, 1857, to, 1862, britain, maintained, diplomats, to, the, hanseatic, cities, until, the, unification, of, germany, in, 1871, the, three, cities, also, had, a, common, hanseatic, representation, in, berlin, until, 1920, 192, three, kontors, remained, as, often, unused, hanseatic, property, after, the, league, s, demise, as, the, peterhof, had, closed, in, the, 16th, century, bryggen, was, sold, to, norwegian, owners, in, 1754, the, steelyard, in, london, and, the, oostershuis, in, antwerp, were, long, impossible, to, sell, the, steelyard, was, finally, sold, in, 1852, and, the, oostershuis, closed, in, 1593, was, sold, in, 1862, 192, 341, 343, hamburg, bremen, and, l, beck, remained, as, the, only, members, until, the, league, s, formal, end, in, 1862, on, the, eve, of, the, 1867, founding, of, the, north, german, confederation, and, the, 1871, founding, of, the, german, empire, under, kaiser, wilhelm, i, despite, its, collapse, they, cherished, the, link, to, the, hanseatic, league, until, german, reunification, these, three, cities, were, the, only, ones, that, retained, the, words, hanseatic, city, in, their, official, german, names, hamburg, and, bremen, continue, to, style, themselves, officially, as, free, hanseatic, cities, with, l, beck, named, hanseatic, city, for, l, beck, in, particular, this, anachronistic, tie, to, a, glorious, past, remained, important, in, the, 20th, century, in, 1937, the, nazi, party, revoked, its, imperial, immediacy, through, the, greater, hamburg, act, since, 1990, 24, other, german, cities, have, adopted, this, title, the, hanseatic, league, was, a, complex, loose, jointed, constellation, of, protagonists, pursuing, their, own, interests, which, coincided, in, a, shared, program, of, economic, domination, in, the, baltic, region, and, a, by, no, means, monolithic, organization, or, a, state, within, a, state, 37, 38, it, gradually, grew, from, a, network, of, merchant, guilds, into, a, more, formal, association, of, cities, but, never, formed, into, a, legal, person, 91, league, members, were, low, german, speaking, with, the, exception, of, dinant, not, all, towns, with, low, german, merchant, communities, were, members, e, g, emden, memel, today, klaip, da, viborg, today, vyborg, and, narva, however, hansards, also, came, from, settlements, without, german, town, law, the, premise, for, league, membership, was, birth, to, german, parents, subjection, to, german, law, and, a, commercial, education, the, league, served, to, advance, and, defend, its, members, common, interests, commercial, ambitions, such, as, enhancement, of, trade, and, political, ambitions, such, as, ensuring, maximum, independence, from, the, territorial, rulers, 10, 11, league, decisions, and, actions, were, taken, via, a, consensus, based, procedure, if, an, issue, arose, members, were, invited, to, participate, in, a, central, meeting, the, tagfahrt, hanseatic, diet, meeting, ride, sometimes, also, referred, to, as, hansetag, that, may, have, begun, around, 1300, 59, and, were, formalised, since, 1358, or, possibly, 1356, 66, 67, the, member, communities, then, chose, envoys, ratssendeboten, to, represent, their, local, consensus, on, the, issue, at, the, diet, not, every, community, sent, an, envoy, delegates, were, often, entitled, to, represent, multiple, communities, consensus, building, on, local, and, tagfahrt, levels, followed, the, low, saxon, tradition, of, einung, where, consensus, was, defined, as, absence, of, protest, after, a, discussion, the, proposals, that, gained, sufficient, support, were, dictated, to, the, scribe, and, passed, as, binding, rezess, if, the, attendees, did, not, object, those, favouring, alternative, proposals, unlikely, to, get, sufficient, support, remained, silent, during, this, procedure, if, consensus, could, not, be, established, on, a, certain, issue, it, was, found, instead, in, the, appointment, of, league, members, empowered, to, work, out, a, compromise, 70, 72, the, league, was, characterised, by, legal, pluralism, and, the, diets, could, not, issue, laws, but, the, cities, cooperated, to, achieve, limited, trade, regulation, such, as, measures, against, fraud, or, worked, together, on, a, regional, level, attempts, to, harmonise, maritime, law, yielded, a, series, of, ordinances, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, the, most, extensive, maritime, ordinance, was, the, ship, ordinance, and, sea, law, of, 1614, but, it, may, not, have, been, enforced, 31, 37, 38, a, hanseatic, kontor, was, a, settlement, of, hansards, organised, in, the, mid, 14th, century, as, a, private, corporation, that, had, its, own, treasury, court, legislation, and, seal, they, operated, like, an, early, stock, exchange, 443, 446, kontors, were, first, established, to, provide, security, but, also, served, to, secure, privileges, and, engage, in, diplomacy, 128, 130, 134, 135, the, quality, of, goods, was, also, examined, at, kontors, increasing, trade, efficiency, and, they, served, as, bases, to, develop, connections, with, local, rulers, and, as, sources, of, economic, and, political, information, 91, most, kontors, were, also, physical, locations, containing, buildings, that, were, integrated, and, segregated, from, citylife, to, different, degrees, the, kontor, of, bruges, was, an, exception, in, this, regard, it, acquired, buildings, only, as, of, the, 15th, century, 131, 133, like, the, guilds, the, kontore, were, usually, led, by, lterm, nner, eldermen, or, english, aldermen, the, stalhof, a, special, case, had, a, hanseatic, and, an, english, alderman, in, novgorod, the, aldermen, were, replaced, by, a, hofknecht, in, the, 15th, century, 100, 101, the, kontors, statutes, were, read, aloud, to, the, present, merchants, once, a, year, 131, 133, in, 1347, the, kontor, of, bruges, modified, its, statute, to, ensure, an, equal, representation, of, league, members, to, that, end, member, communities, from, different, regions, were, pooled, into, three, circles, drittel, third, the, wendish, and, saxon, drittel, the, westphalian, and, prussian, drittel, as, well, as, the, gothlandian, livonian, and, swedish, drittel, merchants, from, each, drittel, chose, two, aldermen, and, six, members, of, the, eighteen, men, council, achtzehnm, nnerrat, to, administer, the, kontor, for, a, set, period, of, time, 91, 101, 138, 139, in, 1356, during, a, hanseatic, meeting, in, preparation, for, the, first, or, one, of, the, first, tagfahrt, the, league, confirmed, this, statute, all, trader, settlements, including, the, kontors, were, subordinated, to, the, diet, s, decisions, around, this, time, and, their, envoys, received, the, right, to, attend, and, speak, at, diets, albeit, without, voting, power, 91, the, league, gradually, divided, the, organisation, into, three, constituent, parts, called, drittel, german, thirds, as, shown, in, the, table, below, 62, 63, 55, 62, 64, the, hansetag, was, the, only, central, institution, of, the, hanseatic, league, however, with, the, division, into, drittel, the, members, of, the, respective, subdivisions, frequently, held, a, dritteltage, drittel, meeting, to, work, out, common, positions, which, could, then, be, presented, at, a, hansetag, on, a, more, local, level, league, members, also, met, and, while, such, regional, meetings, never, crystalized, into, a, hanseatic, institution, they, gradually, gained, importance, in, the, process, of, preparing, and, implementing, the, diet, s, decisions, 55, 57, from, 1554, the, division, into, drittel, was, modified, to, reduce, the, circles, heterogeneity, to, enhance, the, collaboration, of, the, members, on, a, regional, level, and, thus, to, make, the, league, s, decision, making, process, more, efficient, 217, the, number, of, circles, rose, to, four, so, they, were, called, quartiere, quarters, this, division, was, however, not, adopted, by, the, kontore, who, for, their, purposes, like, lterm, nner, elections, grouped, league, members, in, different, ways, e, g, the, division, adopted, by, the, stalhof, in, london, in, 1554, grouped, members, into, dritteln, whereby, l, beck, merchants, represented, the, wendish, pomeranian, saxon, and, several, westphalian, towns, cologne, merchants, represented, the, cleves, mark, berg, and, dutch, towns, while, danzig, merchants, represented, the, prussian, and, livonian, towns, 38, 92, various, types, of, ships, were, used, the, most, used, type, and, the, most, emblematic, was, the, cog, the, cog, was, a, multi, purpose, clinker, built, ship, with, carvel, bottom, a, stern, rudder, and, a, square, rigged, mast, most, cogs, were, privately, owned, and, were, also, used, as, warships, cogs, were, built, in, various, sizes, and, specifications, and, was, used, on, both, the, seas, and, rivers, they, could, be, outfitted, with, castles, starting, from, the, thirteenth, century, the, cog, was, depicted, on, many, seals, and, several, coats, of, arms, of, hanseatic, cities, like, stralsund, elbl, g, and, wismar, several, shipwrecks, have, been, found, the, most, notable, wreck, is, the, bremen, cog, 35, 36, it, could, carry, a, cargo, of, about, 125, tons, 20, the, hulk, began, to, replace, the, cog, by, 1400, and, cogs, lost, their, dominance, to, them, around, 1450, 264, the, hulk, was, a, bulkier, ship, that, could, carry, larger, cargo, elbl, estimates, they, could, carry, up, to, 500, tons, by, the, 15th, century, it, could, be, clinker, or, carvel, built, 264, 64, no, archeological, evidence, of, a, hulk, has, been, found, in, 1464, danzig, acquired, a, french, carvel, ship, through, a, legal, dispute, and, renamed, it, the, peter, von, danzig, it, was, 40, m, long, and, had, three, masts, one, of, the, largest, ships, of, its, time, danzig, adopted, carvel, construction, around, 1470, 44, other, cities, shifted, to, carvels, starting, from, this, time, an, example, is, the, jesus, of, l, beck, later, sold, to, england, for, use, as, a, warship, and, slave, ship, the, galleonlike, carvel, warship, adler, von, l, beck, was, constructed, by, l, beck, for, military, use, against, sweden, during, the, northern, seven, years, war, 1563, 70, llaunched, in, 1566, it, was, never, put,
