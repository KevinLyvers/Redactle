revolution, after, the, first, in, 1789, it, led, to, the, overthrow, of, king, charles, x, the, french, bourbon, monarch, and, the, ascent, of, his, cousin, louis, philippe, duke, of, orl, ans, after, 18, precarious, years, on, the, throne, louis, philippe, was, overthrown, in, the, french, revolution, of, 1848, the, 1830, revolution, marked, a, shift, from, one, constitutional, monarchy, under, the, restored, house, of, bourbon, to, another, the, july, monarchy, the, transition, of, power, from, the, house, of, bourbon, to, its, cadet, branch, the, house, of, orl, ans, and, the, replacement, of, the, principle, of, hereditary, right, by, that, of, popular, sovereignty, supporters, of, the, bourbons, would, be, called, legitimists, and, supporters, of, louis, philippe, were, known, as, orl, anists, in, addition, there, continued, to, be, bonapartists, supporting, the, return, of, napoleon, s, descendants, after, napoleonic, france, s, defeat, and, surrender, in, may, 1814, continental, europe, and, france, in, particular, was, in, a, state, of, disarray, the, congress, of, vienna, met, to, redraw, the, continent, s, political, map, many, european, countries, attended, the, congress, but, decision, making, was, controlled, by, four, major, powers, the, austrian, empire, represented, by, the, chief, minister, prince, metternich, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, represented, by, its, foreign, secretary, viscount, castlereagh, the, russian, empire, represented, by, emperor, alexander, i, and, prussia, represented, by, king, frederick, william, iii, france, s, foreign, minister, charles, maurice, de, talleyrand, also, attended, the, congress, although, france, was, considered, an, enemy, state, talleyrand, was, allowed, to, attend, the, congress, because, he, claimed, that, he, had, only, cooperated, with, napoleon, under, duress, he, suggested, that, france, be, restored, to, her, legitimate, i, e, pre, napoleonic, borders, and, governments, a, plan, that, with, some, changes, was, accepted, by, the, major, powers, france, was, spared, large, annexations, and, returned, to, its, 1791, borders, the, house, of, bourbon, deposed, by, the, revolution, was, restored, to, the, throne, in, the, person, of, louis, xviii, the, congress, however, forced, louis, to, grant, a, constitution, the, charter, of, 1814, on, 16, september, 1824, after, a, lingering, illness, of, several, months, the, 68, year, old, louis, xviii, died, as, he, was, childless, his, younger, brother, charles, aged, 66, inherited, the, throne, of, france, he, was, known, to, have, more, reactionary, politics, on, 27, september, charles, x, made, his, state, entry, into, paris, to, popular, acclaim, during, the, ceremony, while, presenting, the, king, the, keys, to, the, city, the, comte, de, chabrol, prefect, of, the, seine, declared, proud, to, possess, its, new, king, paris, can, aspire, to, become, the, queen, of, cities, by, its, magnificence, as, its, people, aspire, to, be, foremost, in, its, fidelity, its, devotion, and, its, love, eight, months, later, the, mood, of, the, capital, had, sharply, worsened, in, its, opinion, of, the, new, king, the, causes, of, this, dramatic, shift, in, public, opinion, were, many, but, the, main, two, were, critics, of, the, first, accused, the, king, and, his, new, ministry, of, pandering, to, the, catholic, church, and, by, so, doing, of, violating, guarantees, of, equality, of, religious, belief, as, specified, in, the, charter, of, 1814, the, second, matter, that, of, financial, indemnities, was, far, more, opportunistic, than, the, first, since, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, there, had, been, demands, from, all, groups, to, settle, matters, of, property, ownership, in, order, to, reduce, if, not, eliminate, the, uncertainties, in, the, real, estate, market, but, opponents, many, of, whom, were, frustrated, bonapartists, began, a, whispering, campaign, that, charles, x, was, proposing, this, action, in, order, to, shame, those, opponents, who, had, not, left, the, country, both, measures, they, claimed, were, nothing, more, than, clever, subterfuge, meant, to, bring, about, the, destruction, of, the, charter, of, 1814, up, to, this, time, thanks, to, the, popularity, of, the, constitution, and, the, chamber, of, deputies, with, the, people, of, paris, the, king, s, relationship, with, the, lite, both, the, bourbon, supporters, and, bourbon, opposition, had, remained, solid, this, too, was, about, to, change, on, 12, april, propelled, by, both, genuine, conviction, and, the, spirit, of, independence, the, chamber, of, deputies, roundly, rejected, the, government, s, proposal, to, change, the, inheritance, laws, the, popular, newspaper, le, constitutionnel, pronounced, this, refusal, a, victory, over, the, forces, of, counter, revolutionaries, and, reactionism, the, popularity, of, both, the, chamber, of, peers, and, the, chamber, of, deputies, skyrocketed, and, the, popularity, of, the, king, and, his, ministry, dropped, the, coronation, of, charles, took, place, at, reims, cathedral, on, 29, may, 1825, in, an, elaborate, ceremony, the, king, swore, both, to, uphold, the, charter, but, also, france, s, ancient, fundamental, laws, on, 16, april, 1827, while, reviewing, the, garde, royale, in, the, champ, de, mars, the, king, was, greeted, with, icy, silence, and, many, of, the, spectators, refused, to, remove, their, hats, the, traditional, sign, of, respect, for, the, king, charles, x, later, told, orl, ans, that, although, most, people, present, were, not, too, hostile, some, looked, at, times, with, terrible, expressions, because, of, what, charles, x, s, government, perceived, to, be, growing, relentless, and, increasingly, vitriolic, criticism, of, both, the, government, and, the, church, it, introduced, a, proposal, at, the, chamber, of, deputies, for, a, law, to, tighten, censorship, especially, of, newspapers, the, chamber, for, its, part, objected, so, violently, that, the, humiliated, government, had, no, choice, but, to, withdraw, its, proposals, on, 30, april, on, the, grounds, that, it, had, behaved, in, an, offensive, manner, towards, the, crown, the, king, abruptly, dissolved, the, national, guard, of, paris, a, voluntary, group, of, citizens, formerly, considered, a, reliable, conduit, between, the, monarchy, and, the, people, cooler, heads, were, appalled, would, rather, have, my, head, cut, off, wrote, a, nobleman, from, the, rhineland, upon, hearing, the, news, than, have, counseled, such, an, act, the, only, further, measure, needed, to, cause, a, revolution, is, censorship, on, 17, march, 1830, the, majority, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, passed, a, motion, of, no, confidence, the, address, of, the, 221, against, the, king, and, polignac, s, ministry, the, following, day, charles, dissolved, parliament, and, alarmed, the, opposition, by, delaying, elections, for, two, months, during, this, time, the, liberals, championed, the, 221, as, popular, heroes, while, the, government, struggled, to, gain, support, across, the, country, as, prefects, were, shuffled, around, the, departments, of, france, the, elections, that, followed, taking, place, between, 5, and, 19, july, 1830, returned, a, narrow, majority, for, polignac, and, his, ultra, royalists, but, many, chamber, members, were, nevertheless, hostile, to, the, king, on, sunday, 25, july, 1830, the, king, with, the, agreement, of, polignac, set, out, to, alter, the, charter, of, 1814, by, decree, his, decrees, known, as, the, july, ordinances, dissolved, the, chamber, of, deputies, suspended, the, liberty, of, the, press, excluded, the, commercial, middle, class, from, future, elections, and, called, for, new, elections, on, monday, 26, july, these, decrees, were, published, in, the, leading, conservative, newspaper, in, paris, le, moniteur, on, tuesday, 27, july, a, revolution, began, in, earnest, les, trois, journ, es, de, juillet, and, ultimately, ended, the, bourbon, monarchy, it, was, a, hot, dry, summer, pushing, those, who, could, afford, it, to, leave, paris, for, the, country, most, businessmen, could, not, and, so, were, among, the, first, to, learn, of, the, saint, cloud, ordinances, which, banned, them, from, running, as, candidates, for, the, chamber, of, deputies, such, membership, was, indispensable, to, those, who, sought, the, ultimate, in, social, prestige, in, protest, members, of, the, bourse, refused, to, lend, money, and, business, owners, shuttered, their, factories, workers, were, unceremoniously, turned, out, into, the, street, to, fend, for, themselves, unemployment, which, had, been, growing, through, early, summer, spiked, large, numbers, of, workers, therefore, had, nothing, to, do, but, protest, while, newspapers, such, as, the, journal, des, d, bats, le, moniteur, and, le, constitutionnel, had, already, ceased, publication, in, compliance, with, the, new, law, nearly, 50, journalists, from, a, dozen, city, newspapers, met, in, the, offices, of, le, national, there, they, signed, a, collective, protest, and, vowed, their, newspapers, would, continue, to, run, that, evening, when, police, raided, a, news, press, and, seized, contraband, newspapers, they, were, greeted, by, a, sweltering, unemployed, mob, angrily, shouting, bas, les, bourbons, down, with, the, bourbons, and, vive, la, charte, long, live, the, charter, armand, carrel, a, journalist, wrote, in, the, next, day, s, edition, of, le, national, france, falls, back, into, revolution, by, the, act, of, the, government, itself, the, legal, regime, is, now, interrupted, that, of, force, has, begun, in, the, situation, in, which, we, are, now, placed, obedience, has, ceased, to, be, a, duty, it, is, for, france, to, judge, how, far, its, own, resistance, ought, to, extend, despite, public, anger, over, the, police, raid, jean, henri, claude, magin, the, paris, pr, fet, de, police, wrote, that, evening, the, most, perfect, tranquility, continues, to, reign, in, all, parts, of, the, capital, no, event, worthy, of, attention, is, recorded, in, the, reports, that, have, come, through, to, me, throughout, the, day, paris, grew, quiet, as, the, milling, crowds, grew, larger, at, 4, 30, pm, commanders, of, the, troops, of, the, first, military, division, of, paris, and, the, garde, royale, were, ordered, to, concentrate, their, troops, and, guns, on, the, place, du, carrousel, facing, the, tuileries, the, place, vend, me, and, the, place, de, la, bastille, in, order, to, maintain, order, and, protect, gun, shops, from, looters, military, patrols, throughout, the, city, were, established, strengthened, and, expanded, however, no, special, measures, were, taken, to, protect, either, the, arm, depots, or, gunpowder, factories, for, a, time, those, precautions, seemed, premature, but, at, 7, 00, pm, with, the, coming, of, twilight, the, fighting, began, parisians, rather, than, soldiers, were, the, aggressor, paving, stones, roof, tiles, and, flowerpots, from, the, upper, windows, began, to, rain, down, on, the, soldiers, in, the, streets, at, first, soldiers, fired, warning, shots, into, the, air, but, before, the, night, was, over, twenty, one, civilians, were, killed, rioters, then, paraded, the, corpse, of, one, of, their, fallen, throughout, the, streets, shouting, mort, aux, ministres, bas, les, aristocrates, death, to, the, ministers, down, with, the, aristocrats, one, witness, wrote, a, crowd, of, agitated, people, pass, by, and, disappear, then, a, troop, of, cavalry, succeed, them, in, every, direction, and, at, intervals, indistinct, noises, gunshots, and, then, for, a, time, all, is, silent, again, so, for, a, time, one, could, believe, that, everything, in, the, city, was, normal, but, all, the, shops, are, shut, the, pont, neuf, is, almost, completely, dark, the, stupefaction, visible, on, every, face, reminds, us, all, too, much, of, the, crisis, we, face, in, 1828, the, city, of, paris, had, installed, some, 2, 000, street, lamps, these, lanterns, were, hung, on, ropes, looped, on, looped, from, one, pole, to, another, as, opposed, to, being, secured, on, posts, the, rioting, lasted, well, into, the, night, until, most, of, them, had, been, destroyed, by, 10, 00, pm, forcing, the, crowds, to, slip, away, fighting, in, paris, continued, throughout, the, night, one, eyewitness, wrote, it, is, hardly, a, quarter, past, eight, and, already, shouts, and, gun, shots, can, be, heard, business, is, at, a, complete, standstill, crowds, rushing, through, the, streets, the, sound, of, cannon, and, gunfire, is, becoming, ever, louder, cries, of, bas, le, roi, la, guillotine, can, be, heard, charles, x, ordered, mar, chal, auguste, marmont, duke, of, ragusa, the, on, duty, major, general, of, the, garde, royale, to, repress, the, disturbances, marmont, was, personally, liberal, and, opposed, to, the, ministry, s, policy, but, was, bound, tightly, to, the, king, because, he, believed, such, to, be, his, duty, and, possibly, because, of, his, unpopularity, for, his, generally, perceived, and, widely, criticized, desertion, of, napoleon, in, 1814, the, king, remained, at, saint, cloud, but, was, kept, abreast, of, the, events, in, paris, by, his, ministers, who, insisted, that, the, troubles, would, end, as, soon, as, the, rioters, ran, out, of, ammunition, marmont, s, plan, was, to, have, the, garde, royale, and, available, line, units, of, the, city, garrison, guard, the, vital, thoroughfares, and, bridges, of, the, city, as, well, as, protect, important, buildings, such, as, the, palais, royal, palais, de, justice, and, the, h, tel, de, ville, this, plan, was, both, ill, considered, and, wildly, ambitious, not, only, were, there, not, enough, troops, but, there, were, also, nowhere, near, enough, provisions, the, garde, royale, was, mostly, loyal, for, the, moment, but, the, attached, line, units, were, wavering, a, small, but, growing, number, of, troops, were, deserting, some, merely, slipping, away, others, leaving, not, caring, who, saw, them, in, paris, a, committee, of, the, bourbon, opposition, composed, of, banker, and, kingmaker, jacques, laffitte, casimir, perier, generals, tienne, g, rard, and, georges, mouton, comte, de, lobau, among, others, had, drawn, up, and, signed, a, petition, in, which, they, asked, for, the, ordonnances, to, be, withdrawn, the, petition, was, critical, not, of, the, king, but, his, ministers, thereby, countering, the, conviction, of, charles, x, that, his, liberal, opponents, were, enemies, of, his, dynasty, after, signing, the, petition, committee, members, went, directly, to, marmont, to, beg, for, an, end, to, the, bloodshed, and, to, plead, with, him, to, become, a, mediator, between, saint, cloud, and, paris, marmont, acknowledged, the, petition, but, stated, that, the, people, of, paris, would, have, to, lay, down, arms, first, for, a, settlement, to, be, reached, discouraged, but, not, despairing, the, party, then, sought, out, the, king, s, chief, minister, de, polignac, jeanne, d, arc, en, culottes, from, polignac, they, received, even, less, satisfaction, he, refused, to, see, them, perhaps, because, he, knew, that, discussions, would, be, a, waste, of, time, like, marmont, he, knew, that, charles, x, considered, the, ordonnances, vital, to, the, safety, and, dignity, of, the, throne, of, france, thus, the, king, would, not, withdraw, the, ordonnances, at, 4, pm, charles, x, received, colonel, komierowski, one, of, marmont, s, chief, aides, the, colonel, was, carrying, a, note, from, marmont, to, his, majesty, sire, it, is, no, longer, a, riot, it, is, a, revolution, it, is, urgent, for, your, majesty, to, take, measures, for, pacification, the, honour, of, the, crown, can, still, be, saved, tomorrow, perhaps, there, will, be, no, more, time, i, await, with, impatience, your, majesty, s, orders, the, king, asked, polignac, for, advice, and, the, advice, was, to, resist, they, the, king, and, ministers, do, not, come, to, paris, wrote, the, poet, novelist, and, playwright, alfred, de, vigny, people, are, dying, for, them, not, one, prince, has, appeared, the, poor, men, of, the, guard, abandoned, without, orders, without, bread, for, two, days, hunted, everywhere, and, fighting, perhaps, for, the, same, reason, royalists, were, nowhere, to, be, found, perhaps, another, reason, was, that, now, the, r, volt, s, were, well, organized, and, very, well, armed, in, only, a, day, and, a, night, over, 4, 000, barricades, had, been, thrown, up, throughout, the, city, the, tricolor, flag, of, the, revolutionaries, the, people, s, flag, flew, over, buildings, an, increasing, number, of, them, important, buildings, marmont, lacked, either, the, initiative, or, the, presence, of, mind, to, call, for, additional, troops, from, saint, denis, vincennes, lun, ville, or, saint, omer, neither, did, he, ask, for, help, from, reservists, or, those, parisians, still, loyal, to, charles, x, the, bourbon, opposition, and, supporters, of, the, july, revolution, swarmed, to, his, headquarters, demanding, the, arrest, of, polignac, and, the, other, ministers, while, supporters, of, the, bourbon, and, city, leaders, demanded, he, arrest, the, rioters, and, their, puppet, masters, marmont, refused, to, act, on, either, request, instead, awaiting, orders, from, the, king, by, 1, 30, pm, the, tuileries, palace, had, been, sacked, a, man, wearing, a, ball, dress, belonging, to, the, duchesse, de, berry, the, king, s, widowed, daughter, in, law, and, the, mother, of, the, heir, to, the, throne, with, feathers, and, flowers, in, his, hair, screamed, from, a, palace, window, je, re, ois, je, re, ois, i, receive, i, receive, others, drank, wine, from, the, palace, cellars, earlier, that, day, the, louvre, had, fallen, even, more, quickly, swiss, troops, of, the, royal, army, confronted, by, the, mob, and, under, orders, from, marmont, not, to, fire, unless, fired, upon, were, withdrawn, by, their, officers, who, feared, a, repetition, of, the, massacre, of, swiss, guards, that, had, occurred, when, the, tuileries, had, been, stormed, on, 10, august, 1792, by, mid, afternoon, the, greatest, prize, the, h, tel, de, ville, had, been, captured, the, amount, of, looting, during, these, three, days, was, surprisingly, small, not, only, at, the, louvre, whose, paintings, and, objets, d, art, were, protected, by, the, crowd, but, the, tuileries, the, palais, de, justice, the, archbishop, s, palace, and, other, places, as, well, a, few, hours, later, politicians, entered, the, battered, complex, and, set, about, establishing, a, provisional, government, though, there, would, be, spots, of, fighting, throughout, the, city, for, the, next, few, days, the, revolution, for, all, intents, and, purposes, was, over, the, revolution, of, july, 1830, created, a, constitutional, monarchy, on, 2, august, charles, x, and, his, son, the, dauphin, abdicated, their, rights, to, the, throne, and, departed, for, great, britain, although, charles, had, intended, that, his, grandson, the, duke, of, bordeaux, would, take, the, throne, as, henry, v, the, politicians, who, composed, the, provisional, government, instead, placed, on, the, throne, a, distant, cousin, louis, philippe, of, the, house, of, orl, ans, who, agreed, to, rule, as, a, constitutional, monarch, this, period, became, known, as, the, july, monarchy, supporters, of, the, exiled, senior, line, of, the, bourbon, dynasty, became, known, as, legitimists, the, july, column, located, on, place, de, la, bastille, commemorates, the, events, of, the, three, glorious, days, this, renewed, french, revolution, sparked, an, august, uprising, in, brussels, and, the, southern, provinces, of, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, leading, to, separation, and, the, establishment, of, the, kingdom, of, belgium, there, was, also, a, successful, revolution, in, brunswick, the, example, of, the, july, revolution, also, inspired, unsuccessful, revolutions, in, italy, and, the, november, uprising, in, poland, two, years, later, parisian, republicans, disillusioned, by, the, outcome, and, underlying, motives, of, the, uprising, revolted, in, an, event, known, as, the, june, rebellion, although, the, insurrection, was, crushed, within, less, than, a, week, the, july, monarchy, remained, doubtfully, popular, disliked, for, different, reasons, by, both, right, and, left, and, was, eventually, overthrown, in, 1848
