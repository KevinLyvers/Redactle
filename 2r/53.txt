the, history, of, the, united, kingdom, begins, in, 1707, with, the, treaty, of, union, and, acts, of, union, the, core, of, the, united, kingdom, as, a, unified, state, came, into, being, with, the, political, union, of, the, kingdoms, of, england, and, scotland, into, a, new, unitary, state, called, great, britain, of, this, new, state, the, historian, simon, schama, said, what, began, as, a, hostile, merger, would, end, in, a, full, partnership, in, the, most, powerful, going, concern, in, the, world, it, was, one, of, the, most, astonishing, transformations, in, european, history, the, acts, of, union, 1800, added, the, kingdom, of, ireland, to, create, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, the, first, decades, were, marked, by, jacobite, risings, which, ended, with, defeat, for, the, stuart, cause, at, the, battle, of, culloden, in, 1746, in, 1763, victory, in, the, seven, years, war, led, to, the, growth, of, the, first, british, empire, with, defeat, by, the, united, states, france, and, spain, in, the, war, of, american, independence, great, britain, lost, its, 13, american, colonies, and, rebuilt, a, second, british, empire, based, in, asia, and, africa, as, a, result, british, culture, and, its, technological, political, constitutional, and, linguistic, influence, became, worldwide, politically, the, central, event, was, the, french, revolution, and, its, napoleonic, aftermath, from, 1793, to, 1815, which, british, elites, saw, as, a, profound, threat, and, worked, energetically, to, form, multiple, coalitions, that, finally, defeated, napoleon, in, 1815, the, tories, who, came, to, power, in, 1783, remained, in, power, with, a, short, interruption, until, 1830, forces, of, reform, often, emanating, from, the, evangelical, religious, elements, opened, decades, of, political, reform, that, broadened, the, ballot, and, opened, the, economy, to, free, trade, the, outstanding, political, leaders, of, the, 19th, century, included, palmerston, disraeli, gladstone, and, salisbury, culturally, the, victorian, era, was, a, time, of, prosperity, and, dominant, middle, class, virtues, when, britain, dominated, the, world, economy, and, maintained, a, generally, peaceful, century, from, 1815, to, 1914, the, first, world, war, with, britain, in, alliance, with, france, russia, and, the, united, states, was, a, furious, but, ultimately, successful, total, war, with, germany, the, resulting, league, of, nations, was, a, favourite, project, in, interwar, britain, however, while, the, empire, remained, strong, as, did, the, london, financial, markets, the, british, industrial, base, began, to, slip, behind, germany, and, especially, the, united, states, sentiments, for, peace, were, so, strong, that, the, nation, supported, appeasement, of, hitler, s, germany, in, the, late, 1930s, until, the, nazi, invasion, of, poland, in, 1939, started, the, second, world, war, in, the, second, world, war, the, soviet, union, and, the, us, joined, the, uk, as, the, main, allied, powers, britain, was, no, longer, a, military, or, economic, superpower, as, seen, in, the, suez, crisis, of, 1956, britain, no, longer, had, the, wealth, to, maintain, an, empire, so, it, granted, independence, to, almost, all, its, possessions, the, new, states, typically, joined, the, commonwealth, of, nations, the, postwar, years, saw, great, hardships, alleviated, somewhat, by, large, scale, financial, aid, from, the, united, states, and, some, from, canada, prosperity, returned, in, the, 1950s, meanwhile, from, 1945, to, 1950, the, labour, party, built, a, welfare, state, nationalized, many, industries, and, created, the, national, health, service, the, uk, took, a, strong, stand, against, communist, expansion, after, 1945, playing, a, major, role, in, the, cold, war, and, the, formation, of, nato, as, an, anti, soviet, military, alliance, with, west, germany, france, the, united, states, italy, canada, and, smaller, countries, nato, remains, a, powerful, military, coalition, the, uk, has, been, a, leading, member, of, the, united, nations, since, its, founding, as, well, as, numerous, other, international, organizations, in, the, 1990s, neoliberalism, led, to, the, privatisation, of, nationalised, industries, and, significant, deregulation, of, business, affairs, london, s, status, as, a, world, financial, hub, grew, continuously, since, the, 1990s, large, scale, devolution, movements, in, northern, ireland, scotland, and, wales, have, decentralised, political, decision, making, britain, has, moved, back, and, forth, on, its, economic, relationships, with, western, europe, it, joined, the, european, economic, community, in, 1973, thereby, weakening, economic, ties, with, its, commonwealth, however, the, brexit, referendum, in, 2016, committed, the, uk, to, leave, the, european, union, which, it, did, in, 2020, in, 1922, 26, counties, of, ireland, seceded, to, become, the, irish, free, state, a, day, later, northern, ireland, seceded, from, the, free, state, and, returned, to, the, united, kingdom, in, 1927, the, united, kingdom, changed, its, formal, title, to, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, northern, ireland, usually, shortened, to, britain, and, after, 1945, to, the, united, kingdom, or, uk, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, came, into, being, on, 1, may, 1707, as, a, result, of, the, political, union, of, the, kingdom, of, england, which, included, wales, and, the, kingdom, of, scotland, under, the, treaty, of, union, this, combined, the, two, kingdoms, into, a, single, kingdom, and, merged, the, two, parliaments, into, a, single, parliament, of, great, britain, queen, anne, became, the, first, monarch, of, the, new, great, britain, although, now, a, single, kingdom, certain, institutions, of, scotland, and, england, remained, separate, such, as, scottish, and, english, law, and, the, presbyterian, church, of, scotland, and, the, anglican, church, of, england, england, and, scotland, each, also, continued, to, have, their, own, system, of, education, meanwhile, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, against, france, was, underway, it, see, sawed, back, and, forth, until, a, more, peace, minded, government, came, to, power, in, london, and, the, treaties, of, utrecht, and, rastadt, ended, the, war, british, historian, g, m, trevelyan, argues, that, treaty, which, ushered, in, the, stable, and, characteristic, period, of, eighteenth, century, civilization, marked, the, end, of, danger, to, europe, from, the, old, french, monarchy, and, it, marked, a, change, of, no, less, significance, to, the, world, at, large, the, maritime, commercial, and, financial, supremacy, of, great, britain, the, stuart, line, died, with, anne, in, 1714, although, a, die, hard, faction, with, french, support, supported, pretenders, the, elector, of, hanover, became, king, as, george, i, he, paid, more, attention, to, hanover, and, surrounded, himself, with, germans, making, him, an, unpopular, king, he, did, however, build, up, the, army, and, created, a, more, stable, political, system, in, britain, and, helped, bring, peace, to, northern, europe, jacobite, factions, seeking, a, stuart, restoration, remained, strong, they, instigated, a, revolt, in, 1715, 1716, the, son, of, james, ii, planned, to, invade, england, but, before, he, could, do, so, john, erskine, earl, of, mar, launched, an, invasion, from, scotland, which, was, easily, defeated, george, ii, enhanced, the, stability, of, the, constitutional, system, with, a, government, run, by, robert, walpole, during, the, period, 1730, 1742, he, built, up, the, first, british, empire, strengthening, the, colonies, in, the, caribbean, and, north, america, in, coalition, with, the, rising, power, prussia, the, united, kingdom, defeated, france, in, the, seven, years, war, and, won, full, control, of, canada, george, iii, never, visited, hanover, and, spoke, english, as, his, first, language, reviled, by, americans, as, a, tyrant, and, the, instigator, of, the, american, war, of, independence, he, was, insane, off, and, on, after, 1788, and, his, eldest, son, served, as, regent, he, was, the, last, king, to, dominate, government, and, politics, and, his, long, reign, is, noted, for, losing, the, first, british, empire, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, 1783, as, france, sought, revenge, for, its, defeat, in, the, seven, years, war, by, aiding, the, americans, the, reign, was, notable, for, the, building, of, a, second, empire, based, in, india, asia, and, africa, the, beginnings, of, the, industrial, revolution, that, made, britain, an, economic, powerhouse, and, above, all, the, life, and, death, struggle, with, the, french, in, the, french, revolutionary, wars, which, ended, inconclusively, with, a, short, truce, and, the, epic, napoleonic, wars, which, ended, with, the, decisive, defeat, of, napoleon, entrepreneurs, gradually, extended, the, range, of, their, business, around, the, globe, the, south, sea, bubble, was, a, business, enterprise, that, exploded, in, scandal, the, south, sea, company, was, a, joint, stock, company, in, london, its, ostensible, object, was, to, grant, trade, monopolies, in, south, america, but, its, actual, purpose, was, to, renegotiate, previous, high, interest, government, loans, amounting, to, 31, million, through, market, manipulation, and, speculation, it, raised, money, four, times, in, 1720, by, issuing, stock, which, was, purchased, by, about, 8, 000, investors, the, share, price, kept, soaring, every, day, from, 130, a, share, to, 1, 000, with, insiders, making, huge, paper, profits, the, bubble, collapsed, overnight, ruining, many, speculators, investigations, showed, bribes, had, reached, into, high, places, even, to, the, king, robert, walpole, managed, to, wind, it, down, with, minimal, political, and, economic, damage, although, some, losers, fled, to, exile, or, committed, suicide, robert, walpole, is, now, generally, regarded, as, the, first, prime, minister, from, 1721, 1742, and, indeed, he, invented, the, role, the, term, was, applied, to, him, by, friends, and, foes, alike, by, 1727, historian, clayton, roberts, summarizes, his, new, functions, he, monopolized, the, counsels, of, the, king, he, closely, superintended, the, administration, he, ruthlessly, controlled, patronage, and, he, led, the, predominant, party, in, parliament, walpole, was, a, master, of, the, effective, use, of, patronage, as, were, his, two, disciples, who, succeeded, him, as, prime, minister, henry, pelham, and, pelham, s, brother, the, duke, of, newcastle, hypocrisy, became, a, major, topic, in, english, political, history, in, the, early, 18th, century, the, toleration, act, 1688, allowed, for, certain, rights, for, religious, minorities, but, protestant, nonconformists, such, as, congregationalists, and, baptists, were, still, deprived, of, important, rights, such, as, the, right, to, hold, office, nonconformists, who, wanted, to, hold, office, ostentatiously, took, the, anglican, sacrament, once, a, year, in, order, to, avoid, the, restrictions, high, church, anglicans, were, outraged, they, outlawed, what, they, called, occasional, conformity, in, 1711, with, the, occasional, conformity, act, 1711, in, the, political, controversies, using, sermons, speeches, and, pamphlet, wars, both, high, churchmen, and, nonconformists, attacked, their, opponents, as, insincere, and, hypocritical, as, well, as, dangerously, zealous, in, contrast, to, their, own, moderation, this, campaign, of, moderation, versus, zealotry, peaked, in, 1709, during, the, impeachment, trial, of, high, church, preacher, henry, sacheverell, historian, mark, knights, argues, that, by, its, very, ferocity, the, debate, may, have, led, to, more, temperate, and, less, hypercharged, political, discourse, occasional, conformity, was, restored, by, the, whigs, when, they, returned, to, power, in, 1719, english, author, bernard, mandeville, s, famous, the, fable, of, the, bees, explored, the, nature, of, hypocrisy, in, contemporary, european, society, on, one, hand, mandeville, was, a, moralist, heir, to, the, french, augustinianism, of, the, previous, century, viewing, sociability, as, a, mere, mask, for, vanity, and, pride, on, the, other, he, was, a, materialist, who, helped, found, modern, economics, he, tried, to, demonstrate, the, universality, of, human, appetites, for, corporeal, pleasures, he, argued, that, the, efforts, of, self, seeking, entrepreneurs, are, the, basis, of, emerging, commercial, and, industrial, society, a, line, of, thought, that, influenced, adam, smith, and, 19th, century, utilitarianism, a, tension, arose, between, these, two, approaches, concerning, the, relative, power, of, norms, and, interests, the, relationship, between, motives, and, behaviour, and, the, historical, variability, of, human, cultures, from, around, 1750, to, 1850, whig, aristocrats, in, england, boasted, of, their, special, benevolence, for, the, common, people, they, claimed, to, be, guiding, and, counselling, reform, initiatives, to, prevent, the, outbreaks, of, popular, discontent, that, caused, instability, and, revolution, across, europe, however, tory, and, radical, critics, accused, the, whigs, of, hypocrisy, alleging, they, were, deliberately, using, the, slogans, of, reform, and, democracy, to, boost, themselves, into, power, while, preserving, their, precious, aristocratic, exclusiveness, historian, l, g, mitchell, defends, the, whigs, pointing, out, that, thanks, to, them, radicals, always, had, friends, at, the, centre, of, the, political, elite, and, thus, did, not, feel, as, marginalised, as, in, most, of, europe, he, points, out, that, the, debates, on, the, 1832, reform, bill, showed, that, reformers, would, indeed, receive, a, hearing, at, parliamentary, level, with, a, good, chance, of, success, meanwhile, a, steady, stream, of, observers, from, the, continent, commented, on, the, english, political, culture, liberal, and, radical, observers, noted, the, servility, of, the, english, lower, classes, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, obsession, everyone, had, with, rank, and, title, the, extravagance, of, the, aristocracy, and, a, pervasive, hypocrisy, that, extended, into, such, areas, as, social, reform, there, were, not, so, many, conservative, visitors, they, praised, the, stability, of, english, society, its, ancient, constitution, and, reverence, for, the, past, they, ignored, the, negative, effects, of, industrialisation, historians, have, explored, crimes, and, vices, of, england, s, upper, classes, especially, duelling, suicide, adultery, and, gambling, they, were, tolerated, by, the, same, courts, that, executed, thousands, of, poor, men, and, boys, for, lesser, offenses, no, aristocrat, was, punished, for, killing, someone, in, a, duel, however, the, emerging, popular, press, specialized, in, sensationalistic, stories, about, upper, class, vice, which, led, the, middle, classes, to, focus, their, critiques, on, a, decadent, aristocracy, that, had, much, more, money, but, much, less, morality, than, the, middle, class, from, 1700, to, 1850, britain, was, involved, in, 137, wars, or, rebellions, it, maintained, a, relatively, large, and, expensive, royal, navy, along, with, a, small, standing, army, when, the, need, arose, for, soldiers, it, hired, mercenaries, or, financed, allies, who, fielded, armies, the, rising, costs, of, warfare, forced, a, shift, in, the, sources, of, government, financing, from, the, income, from, royal, agricultural, estates, and, special, imposts, and, taxes, to, reliance, on, customs, and, excise, taxes, and, after, 1790, an, income, tax, working, with, bankers, in, the, city, the, government, raised, large, loans, during, wartime, and, paid, them, off, in, peacetime, the, rise, in, taxes, amounted, to, 20, of, national, income, but, the, private, sector, benefited, from, the, increase, in, economic, growth, the, demand, for, war, supplies, stimulated, the, industrial, sector, particularly, naval, supplies, munitions, and, textiles, which, gave, britain, an, advantage, in, international, trade, during, the, postwar, years, the, french, revolution, polarised, british, political, opinion, in, the, 1790s, with, conservatives, outraged, at, the, killing, of, the, king, the, expulsion, of, the, nobles, and, the, reign, of, terror, britain, was, at, war, against, france, almost, continuously, from, 1793, until, the, final, defeat, of, napoleon, in, 1815, conservatives, castigated, every, radical, opinion, in, britain, as, jacobin, in, reference, to, the, leaders, of, the, terror, warning, that, radicalism, threatened, an, upheaval, of, british, society, the, anti, jacobin, sentiment, well, expressed, by, edmund, burke, and, many, popular, writers, was, strongest, among, the, landed, gentry, and, the, upper, classes, the, seven, years, war, which, began, in, 1756, was, the, first, war, waged, on, a, global, scale, fought, in, europe, india, north, america, the, caribbean, the, philippines, and, coastal, africa, britain, was, the, big, winner, as, it, enlarged, its, empire, at, the, expense, of, france, and, others, france, lost, its, role, as, a, colonial, power, in, north, america, it, ceded, new, france, to, britain, putting, a, large, traditionalistic, french, speaking, catholic, element, under, british, control, spain, ceded, florida, to, britain, but, it, only, had, a, few, small, outposts, there, in, india, the, carnatic, war, had, left, france, still, in, control, of, its, small, enclaves, but, with, military, restrictions, and, an, obligation, to, support, british, client, states, effectively, leaving, the, future, of, india, to, britain, the, british, victory, over, france, in, the, seven, years, war, therefore, left, britain, as, the, world, s, dominant, colonial, power, during, the, 1760s, and, 1770s, relations, between, the, thirteen, colonies, and, britain, became, increasingly, strained, primarily, because, of, growing, anger, against, parliament, s, repeated, attempts, to, tax, american, colonists, without, their, consent, the, americans, readied, their, large, militias, but, were, short, of, gunpowder, and, artillery, the, british, assumed, falsely, that, they, could, easily, suppress, patriot, resistance, in, 1775, the, american, revolutionary, war, began, in, 1776, the, patriots, expelled, all, the, royal, officials, and, declared, the, independence, of, the, united, states, of, america, after, capturing, a, british, invasion, army, in, 1777, the, new, nation, formed, an, alliance, with, france, and, in, turn, spain, aided, france, equalizing, the, military, and, naval, balance, and, putting, britain, at, risk, of, invasion, from, france, the, british, army, controlled, only, a, handful, of, coastal, cities, in, the, u, s, 1780, 1781, was, a, low, point, for, britain, taxes, and, deficits, were, high, government, corruption, was, pervasive, and, the, war, in, america, was, entering, its, sixth, year, with, no, apparent, end, in, sight, the, gordon, riots, erupted, in, london, during, the, spring, of, 1780, in, response, to, increased, concessions, to, catholics, by, parliament, in, october, 1781, lord, cornwallis, surrendered, his, army, at, yorktown, virginia, the, treaty, of, paris, was, signed, in, 1783, formally, terminating, the, war, and, recognising, the, independence, of, the, united, states, the, peace, terms, were, very, generous, to, the, new, nation, which, london, hoped, correctly, would, become, a, major, trading, partner, the, loss, of, the, thirteen, colonies, at, the, time, britain, s, most, populous, colonies, marked, the, transition, between, the, first, and, second, empires, in, which, britain, shifted, its, attention, to, asia, the, pacific, and, later, africa, adam, smith, s, the, wealth, of, nations, published, in, 1776, had, argued, that, colonies, were, redundant, and, that, free, trade, should, replace, the, old, mercantilist, policies, that, had, characterised, the, first, period, of, colonial, expansion, dating, back, to, the, protectionism, of, spain, and, portugal, the, growth, of, trade, between, the, newly, independent, united, states, and, britain, after, 1783, confirmed, smith, s, view, that, political, control, was, not, necessary, for, economic, success, during, its, first, 100, years, of, operation, the, focus, of, the, british, east, india, company, had, been, trade, not, the, building, of, an, empire, in, india, company, interests, turned, from, trade, to, territory, during, the, 18th, century, as, the, mughal, empire, declined, in, power, and, the, british, east, india, company, struggled, with, its, french, counterpart, the, french, east, india, company, during, the, carnatic, wars, of, the, 1740s, and, 1750s, the, british, led, by, robert, clive, defeated, the, french, and, their, indian, allies, in, the, battle, of, plassey, leaving, the, company, in, control, of, bengal, and, a, major, military, and, political, power, in, india, in, the, following, decades, it, gradually, increased, the, size, of, the, territories, under, its, control, either, ruling, directly, or, indirectly, via, local, puppet, rulers, under, the, threat, of, force, of, the, indian, army, 80, of, which, was, composed, of, native, indian, sepoys, on, 22, august, 1770, james, cook, discovered, the, eastern, coast, of, australia, while, on, a, scientific, voyage, to, the, south, pacific, in, 1778, joseph, banks, cook, s, botanist, on, the, voyage, presented, evidence, to, the, government, on, the, suitability, of, botany, bay, for, the, establishment, of, a, penal, settlement, and, in, 1787, the, first, shipment, of, convicts, set, sail, arriving, in, 1788, the, british, government, had, somewhat, mixed, reactions, to, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, and, when, war, broke, out, on, the, continent, in, 1792, it, initially, remained, neutral, but, the, following, january, louis, xvi, was, beheaded, this, combined, with, a, threatened, invasion, of, the, netherlands, by, france, spurred, britain, to, declare, war, for, the, next, 23, years, the, two, nations, were, at, war, except, for, a, short, period, in, 1802, 1803, britain, alone, among, the, nations, of, europe, never, submitted, to, or, formed, an, alliance, with, france, throughout, the, 1790s, the, british, repeatedly, defeated, the, navies, of, france, and, its, allies, but, were, unable, to, perform, any, significant, land, operations, an, anglo, russian, invasion, of, the, netherlands, in, 1799, accomplished, little, except, the, capture, of, the, dutch, fleet, on, 1, january, 1801, the, first, day, of, the, 19th, century, the, great, britain, and, ireland, joined, to, form, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, the, legislative, union, of, great, britain, and, ireland, was, brought, about, by, the, act, of, union, 1800, creating, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, the, act, was, passed, in, both, the, parliament, of, great, britain, and, the, parliament, of, ireland, dominated, by, the, protestant, ascendancy, and, lacking, representation, of, the, country, s, catholic, population, substantial, majorities, were, achieved, and, according, to, contemporary, documents, this, was, assisted, by, bribery, in, the, form, of, the, awarding, of, peerages, and, honours, to, opponents, to, gain, their, votes, under, the, terms, of, the, merger, the, separate, parliaments, of, great, britain, and, ireland, were, abolished, and, replaced, by, a, united, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, ireland, thus, became, an, integral, part, of, the, united, kingdom, sending, around, 100, mps, to, the, house, of, commons, at, westminster, and, 28, irish, representative, peers, to, the, house, of, lords, elected, from, among, their, number, by, the, irish, peers, themselves, except, that, roman, catholic, peers, were, not, permitted, to, take, their, seats, in, the, lords, part, of, the, trade, off, for, the, irish, catholics, was, to, be, the, granting, of, catholic, emancipation, which, had, been, fiercely, resisted, by, the, all, anglican, irish, parliament, however, this, was, blocked, by, king, george, iii, who, argued, that, emancipating, the, roman, catholics, would, breach, his, coronation, oath, the, roman, catholic, hierarchy, had, endorsed, the, union, however, the, decision, to, block, catholic, emancipation, fatally, undermined, the, appeal, of, the, union, at, the, threshold, to, the, 19th, century, britain, was, challenged, again, by, france, under, napoleon, in, a, struggle, that, unlike, previous, wars, represented, a, contest, of, ideologies, between, the, two, nations, the, constitutional, monarchy, of, great, britain, versus, the, liberal, principles, of, the, french, revolution, ostensibly, championed, by, the, napoleonic, empire, it, was, not, only, britain, s, position, on, the, world, stage, that, was, threatened, napoleon, threatened, invasion, of, britain, itself, and, with, it, a, fate, similar, to, the, countries, of, continental, europe, that, his, armies, had, overrun, during, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, britain, occupied, most, of, the, french, and, dutch, colonies, the,

forced, to, return, most, of, the, colonies, in, may, 1803, war, was, declared, again, napoleon, s, plans, to, invade, britain, failed, due, to, the, inferiority, of, his, navy, and, in, 1805, lord, nelson, s, fleet, decisively, defeated, the, french, and, spanish, at, trafalgar, which, was, the, last, significant, naval, action, of, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1806, napoleon, issued, the, series, of, berlin, decrees, which, brought, into, effect, the, continental, system, this, policy, aimed, to, weaken, the, british, export, economy, closing, french, controlled, territory, to, its, trade, napoleon, hoped, that, isolating, britain, from, the, continent, would, end, its, economic, dominance, it, never, succeeded, in, its, objective, britain, possessed, the, greatest, industrial, capacity, in, europe, and, its, mastery, of, the, seas, allowed, it, to, build, up, considerable, economic, strength, through, trade, to, its, possessions, from, its, rapidly, expanding, new, empire, britain, s, naval, supremacy, meant, that, france, could, never, enjoy, the, peace, necessary, to, consolidate, its, control, over, europe, and, it, could, threaten, neither, the, home, islands, nor, the, main, british, colonies, the, dos, de, mayo, uprising, at, last, permitted, britain, to, gain, a, foothold, on, the, continent, the, duke, of, wellington, and, his, army, of, british, and, portuguese, gradually, pushed, the, french, out, of, spain, and, in, early, 1814, as, napoleon, was, being, driven, back, in, the, east, by, the, prussians, austrians, and, russians, wellington, invaded, southern, france, after, napoleon, s, surrender, and, exile, to, the, island, of, elba, peace, appeared, to, have, returned, but, when, he, escaped, back, into, france, in, 1815, the, british, and, their, allies, had, to, fight, him, again, the, armies, of, wellington, and, von, bl, cher, defeated, napoleon, once, and, for, all, at, waterloo, a, key, element, in, british, success, was, its, ability, to, mobilize, the, nation, s, industrial, and, financial, resources, and, apply, them, to, defeating, france, with, a, population, of, 16, million, britain, was, barely, half, the, size, of, france, with, 30, million, in, terms, of, soldiers, the, french, numerical, advantage, was, offset, by, british, subsidies, that, paid, for, a, large, proportion, of, the, austrian, and, russian, soldiers, peaking, at, about, 450, 000, in, 1813, most, important, the, british, national, output, remained, strong, and, the, well, organized, business, sector, channeled, products, into, what, the, military, needed, the, system, of, smuggling, finished, products, into, the, continent, undermined, french, efforts, to, ruin, the, british, economy, by, cutting, off, markets, the, british, budget, in, 1814, reached, 66, million, including, 10, million, for, the, navy, 40, million, for, the, army, 10, million, for, the, allies, and, 38, million, as, interest, on, the, national, debt, the, national, debt, soared, to, 679, million, more, than, double, the, gdp, it, was, willingly, supported, by, hundreds, of, thousands, of, investors, and, tax, payers, despite, the, higher, taxes, on, land, and, a, new, income, tax, the, whole, cost, of, the, war, came, to, 831, million, by, contrast, the, french, financial, system, was, inadequate, and, napoleon, s, forces, had, to, rely, in, part, on, requisitions, from, conquered, lands, napoleon, also, attempted, economic, warfare, against, britain, especially, in, the, berlin, decree, of, 1806, it, forbade, the, import, of, british, goods, into, european, countries, allied, with, or, dependent, upon, france, and, installed, the, continental, system, in, europe, all, connections, were, to, be, cut, even, the, mail, british, merchants, smuggled, in, many, goods, and, the, continental, system, was, not, a, powerful, weapon, of, economic, war, there, was, some, damage, to, britain, especially, in, 1808, and, 1811, but, its, control, of, the, oceans, helped, ameliorate, the, damage, even, more, damage, was, done, to, the, economies, of, france, and, its, allies, which, lost, a, useful, trading, partner, angry, governments, gained, an, incentive, to, ignore, the, continental, system, which, led, to, the, weakening, of, napoleon, s, coalition, simultaneous, with, the, napoleonic, wars, trade, disputes, and, british, impressment, of, american, sailors, led, to, the, war, of, 1812, with, the, united, states, this, was, the, second, war, of, independence, for, the, americans, though, in, reality, it, was, never, about, british, efforts, to, conquer, the, former, colonies, but, about, the, conquest, of, the, canadian, colonies, by, the, americans, it, was, little, noticed, in, britain, where, all, attention, was, focused, on, the, struggle, with, france, the, british, could, devote, few, resources, to, the, conflict, until, the, fall, of, napoleon, in, 1814, american, frigates, also, inflicted, a, series, of, embarrassing, defeats, on, the, british, navy, which, was, short, on, manpower, due, to, the, conflict, in, europe, a, stepped, up, war, effort, that, year, brought, about, some, successes, such, as, the, burning, of, washington, but, many, influential, voices, such, as, the, duke, of, wellington, argued, that, an, outright, victory, over, the, us, was, impossible, peace, was, agreed, to, at, the, end, of, 1814, but, andrew, jackson, unaware, of, this, won, a, great, victory, over, the, british, at, the, battle, of, new, orleans, in, january, 1815, news, took, several, weeks, to, cross, the, atlantic, before, the, advent, of, steam, ships, ratification, of, the, treaty, of, ghent, ended, the, war, in, february, 1815, the, major, result, was, the, permanent, defeat, of, the, indian, allies, the, british, had, counted, upon, the, us, canada, border, was, demilitarised, by, both, countries, and, peaceful, trade, resumed, although, worries, of, an, american, conquest, of, canada, persisted, into, the, 1860s, the, postwar, era, was, a, time, of, economic, depression, poor, harvests, growing, inflation, and, high, unemployment, among, returning, soldiers, as, industrialisation, progressed, britain, was, more, urban, and, less, rural, and, power, shifted, accordingly, the, dominant, tory, leadership, based, in, the, declining, rural, sector, was, fearful, reactionary, and, repressive, tories, feared, the, possible, emergence, of, radicals, who, might, be, conspiring, to, emulate, the, dreaded, french, revolution, in, reality, the, violent, radical, element, was, small, and, weak, there, were, a, handful, of, small, conspiracies, involving, men, with, few, followers, and, careless, security, they, were, quickly, suppressed, techniques, of, repression, included, the, suspension, of, habeas, corpus, in, 1817, allowing, the, government, to, arrest, and, hold, suspects, without, cause, or, trial, sidmouth, s, gagging, acts, of, 1817, heavily, muzzled, the, opposition, newspapers, the, reformers, switched, to, pamphlets, and, sold, 50, 000, a, week, in, reaction, to, the, peterloo, massacre, of, 1819, the, liverpool, government, passed, the, six, acts, in, 1819, they, prohibited, drills, and, military, exercises, facilitated, warrants, for, the, search, for, weapons, outlawed, public, meetings, of, more, than, 50, people, including, meetings, to, organize, petitions, put, heavy, penalties, on, blasphemous, and, seditious, publications, imposing, a, fourpenny, stamp, act, on, many, pamphlets, to, cut, down, the, flow,

they, were, not, often, used, by, the, end, of, the, 1820s, along, with, a, general, economic, recovery, many, of, these, repressive, laws, were, repealed, and, in, 1828, new, legislation, guaranteed, the, civil, rights, of, religious, dissenters, george, iv, was, a, weak, ruler, as, regent, 1811, 1820, and, king, 1820, 1830, he, let, his, ministers, take, full, charge, of, government, affairs, playing, a, far, lesser, role, than, his, father, george, iii, the, principle, now, became, established, that, the, king, accepts, as, prime, minister, the, person, who, wins, a, majority, in, the,

peace, settlement, and, attempted, to, deal, with, the, social, and, economic, malaise, that, followed, his, brother, william, iv, ruled, 1830, to, 1837, but, was, little, involved, in, politics, his, reign, saw, several, reforms, the, poor, law, was, updated, child, labour, restricted, slavery, abolished, in, nearly, all, the, british, empire, and, most, important, the, reform, act, 1832, refashioned, the, british, electoral, system, there, were, no, major, wars, until, the, crimean, war, of, 1853, 1856, while, prussia, austria, and, russia, as, absolute, monarchies, tried, to, suppress, liberalism, wherever, it, might, occur, the, british, came, to, terms, with, new, ideas, britain, intervened, in, portugal, in, 1826, to, defend, a, constitutional, government, there, and, recognising, the, independence, of, spain, s, american, colonies, in, 1824, british, merchants, and, financiers, and, later, railway, builders, played, major, roles, in, the, economies, of, most, latin, american, nations, the, british, intervened, in, 1827, on, the, side, of, the, greeks, who, had, been, waging, the, greek, war, of, independence, against, the, ottoman, empire, since, 1821, the, whig, party, recovered, its, strength, and, unity, by, supporting, moral, reforms, especially, the, reform, of, the, electoral, system, the, abolition, of, slavery, and, emancipation, of, the, catholics, catholic, emancipation, was, secured, in, the, roman, catholic, relief, act, 1829, which, removed, the, most, substantial, restrictions, on, roman, catholics, in, britain, the, whigs, became, champions, of, parliamentary, reform, they, made, lord, grey, prime, minister, 1830, 1834, and, the, reform, act, 1832, became, their, signature, measure, it, broadened, the, franchise, slightly, and, ended, the, system, of, rotten, and, pocket, boroughs, where, elections, were, controlled, by, powerful, families, and, gave, seats, to, new, industrial, centres, the, aristocracy, continued, to, dominate, the, government, the, army, and, royal, navy, and, high, society, after, parliamentary, investigations, demonstrated, the, horrors, of, child, labour, limited, reforms, were, passed, in, 1833, chartism, emerged, after, the, 1832, reform, bill, failed, to, give, the, vote, to, the, working, class, activists, denounced, the, betrayal, of, the, working, class, and, the,

were, unable, to, force, serious, constitutional, debate, historians, see, chartism, as, both, a, continuation, of, the, 18th, century, fight, against, corruption, and, as, a, new, stage, in, demands, for, democracy, in, an, industrial, society, in, 1832, parliament, abolished, slavery, in, the, empire, with, the, slavery, abolition, act, 1833, the, government, purchased, the, slaves, for, 20, 000, 000, the, money, went, to, rich, plantation, owners, who, mostly, lived, in, england, and, freed, the, slaves, especially, those, in, the, caribbean, sugar, islands, prime, ministers, of, the, period,

technologies, such, as, steam, ships, railways, photography, and, telegraphs, appeared, making, the, world, much, faster, paced, britain, again, remained, mostly, inactive, in, continental, politics, and, it, was, not, affected, by, the, wave, of, revolutions, in, 1848, the, victorian, era, saw, the, fleshing, out, of, the, second, british, empire, scholars, debate, whether, the, victorian, period, as, defined, by, a, variety, of, sensibilities, and, political, concerns, that, have, come, to, be, associated, with, the, victorians, actually, begins, with, her, coronation, or, the, earlier, passage, of, the, reform, act, 1832, the, era, was, preceded, by, the, georgian, era, and, succeeded, by, the, edwardian, era, historians, like, bernard, porter, have, characterized, the, mid, victorian, era, 1850, 1870, as, britain, s, golden, years, there, was, peace, and, prosperity, as, the, national, income, per, person, grew, by, half, much, of, the, prosperity, was, due, to, the, increasing, industrialization, especially, in, textiles, and, machinery, as, well, as, to, the, worldwide, network, of, trade, and, engineering, that, produce, profits, for, british, merchants, and, experts, from, across, the, globe, there, was, peace, abroad, apart, from, the, short, crimean, war, 1854, 1856, and, social, peace, at, home, reforms, in, industrial, conditions, were, set, by, parliament, for, example, in, 1842, the, nation, was, scandalized, by, the, use, of, children, in, coal, mines, the, mines, act, of, 1842, banned, employment, of, girls, and, boys, under, ten, years, old, from, working, underground, in, coal, mines, opposition, to, the, new, order, melted, away, says, porter, the, chartist, movement, peaked, as, a, democratic, movement, among, the, working, class, in, 1848, its, leaders, moved, to, other, pursuits, such, as, trade, unions, and, cooperative, societies, the, working, class, ignored, foreign, agitators, like, karl, marx, in, their, midst, and, joined, in, celebrating, the, new, prosperity, employers, typically, were, paternalistic, and, generally, recognized, the, trade, unions, companies, provided, their, employees, with, welfare, services, ranging, from, housing, schools, and, churches, to, libraries, baths, and, gymnasia, middle, class, reformers, did, their, best, to, assist, the, working, classes, aspire, to, middle, class, norms, of, respectability, there, was, a, spirit, of, libertarianism, says, porter, as, people, felt, they, were, free, taxes, were, very, low, and, government, restrictions, were, minimal, there, were, still, problem, areas, such, as, occasional, riots, especially, those, motivated, by, anti, catholicism, society, was, still, ruled, by, the, aristocracy, and, the, gentry, which, controlled, high, government, offices, both, houses, of, parliament, the, church, and, the, military, becoming, a, rich, businessman, was, not, as, prestigious, as, inheriting, a, title, and, owning, a, landed, estate, literature, was, doing, well, but, the, fine, arts, languished, as, the, great, exhibition, of, 1851, showcased, britain, s, industrial, prowess, rather, than, its, sculpture, painting, or, music, the, educational, system, was, mediocre, the, capstone, universities, outside, scotland, were, likewise, mediocre, historian, llewellyn, woodward, has, concluded, for, leisure, or, work, for, getting, or, spending, england, was, a, better, country, in, 1879, than, in, 1815, the, scales, were, less, weighted, against, the, weak, against, women, and, children, and, against, the, poor, there, was, greater, movement, and, less, of, the, fatalism, of, an, earlier, age, the, public, conscience, was, more, instructed, and, the, content, of, liberty, was, being, widened, to, include, something, more, than, freedom, from, political, constraint, yet, england, in, 1871, was, by, no, means, an, earthly, paradise, the, housing, and, conditions, of, life, of, the, working, class, in, town, country, were, still, a, disgrace, to, an, age, of, plenty, according, to, historians, david, brandon, and, alan, brooke, the, new, system, of, railways, after, 1830, brought, into, being, our, modern, world, they, stimulated, demand, for, building, materials, coal, iron, and, later, steel, excelling, in, the, bulk, movement, of, coal, they, provided, the, fuel, for, the, furnaces, of, industry, and, for, domestic, fireplaces, millions, of, people, were, able, to, travel, who, had, scarcely, ever, travelled, before, railways, enabled, mail, newspapers, periodicals, and, cheap, literature, to, be, distributed, easily, quickly, and, cheaply, allowing, a, much, wider, and, faster, dissemination, of, ideas, and, information, they, had, a, significant, impact, on, improving, diet, a, proportionately, smaller, agricultural, industry, was, able, to, feed, a, much, larger, urban, population, they, employed, huge, quantities, of, labour, both, directly, and, indirectly, they, helped, britain, to, become, the, workshop, of, the, world, by, reducing, transport, costs, not, only, of, raw, materials, but, of, finished, goods, large, amounts, of, which, were, exported, today, s, global, corporations, originated, with, the, great, limited, liability, railway, companies, by, the, third, quarter, of, the, nineteenth, century, there, was, scarcely, any, person, living, in, britain, whose, life, had, not, been, altered, in, some, way, by, the, coming, of, the, railways, railways, contributed, to, the, transformation, of, britain, from, a, rural, to, a, predominantly, urban, society, the, great, london, exhibition, of, 1851, clearly, demonstrated, britain, s, dominance, in, engineering, and, industry, that, lasted, until, the, rise, of, the, united, states, and, germany, in, the, 1890s, using, the, imperial, tools, of, free, trade, and, financial, investment, it, exerted, major, influence, on, many, countries, outside, europe, especially, in, latin, america, and, asia, thus, britain, had, both, a, formal, empire, based, on, british, rule, and, an, informal, one, based, on, the, british, pound, one, nagging, fear, was, the, possible, collapse, of, the, ottoman, empire, it, was, well, understood, that, a, collapse, of, that, country, would, set, off, a, scramble, for, its, territory, and, possibly, plunge, britain, into, war, to, head, that, off, britain, sought, to, keep, the, russians, from, occupying, constantinople, and, taking, over, the, bosporous, straits, as, well, as, from, threatening, india, via, afghanistan, in, 1853, britain, and, france, intervened, in, the, crimean, war, and, defeated, russia, at, a, very, high, cost, in, casualties, in, the, 1870s, the, congress, of, berlin, blocked, russia, from, imposing, the, harsh, treaty, of, san, stefano, on, the, ottoman, empire, despite, its, alliance, with, the, french, in, the, crimean, war, britain, viewed, the, second, empire, of, napoleon, iii, with, some, distrust, especially, as, the, emperor, constructed, ironclad, warships, and, began, returning, france, to, a, more, active, foreign, policy, during, the, american, civil, war, british, leaders, personally, disliked, american, republicanism, and, favoured, the, more, aristocratic, confederacy, as, it, had, been, a, major, source, of, cotton, for, textile, mills, but, the, country, never, recognized, the, confederacy, and, neither, signed, a, treaty, with, it, prince, albert, was, effective, in, defusing, a, war, scare, in, late, 1861, the, british, people, who, depended, heavily, on, american, food, imports, generally, favoured, the, united, states, what, little, cotton, was, available, came, from, new, york, as, the, blockade, by, the, us, navy, shut, down, 95, of, southern, exports, to, britain, in, september, 1862, britain, along, with, france, contemplated, stepping, in, and, negotiating, a, peace, settlement, which, could, only, mean, war, with, the, united, states, but, in, the, same, month, us, president, abraham, lincoln, announced, the, emancipation, proclamation, would, be, issued, in, january, 1863, making, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, confederacy, a, war, goal, since, support, of, the, confederacy, now, meant, support, for, slavery, there, was, no, longer, any, possibility, of, european, intervention, however, the, british, working, class, were, quite, overwhelmingly, pro, union, in, the, end, although, britain, could, survive, without, southern, cotton, the, north, s, meat, and, grain, was, more, important, to, feed, the, uk, s, urban, population, especially, as, a, series, of, bad, harvests, had, affected, british, agriculture, in, the, late, 1850s, to, early, 1860s, meanwhile, the, british, sold, arms, to, both, sides, built, blockade, runners, for, a, lucrative, trade, with, the, confederacy, and, surreptitiously, allowed, warships, to, be, built, for, the, confederacy, the, warships, caused, a, major, diplomatic, row, that, was, resolved, in, the, alabama, claims, in, 1872, in, the, americans, favour, in, 1867, britain, united, most, of, its, north, american, colonies, as, canada, giving, it, self, government, and, responsibility, for, its, internal, affairs, britain, handled, foreign, policy, and, defence, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, saw, a, major, expansion, of, britain, s, colonial, empire, in, asia, and, africa, as, well, as, the, pacific, in, the, scramble, for, africa, the, boast, was, having, the, union, jack, flying, from, cairo, to, cape, town, britain, defended, its, empire, with, the, world, s, dominant, navy, and, a, small, professional, army, it, was, the, only, power, in, europe, to, have, no, conscription, the, rise, of, the, german, empire, after, 1871, posed, a, new, challenge, for, it, along, with, the, united, states, threatened, to, take, britain, s, place, as, the, world, s, foremost, industrial, power, germany, acquired, a, number, of, colonies, in, africa, and, the, pacific, but, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, succeeded, in, achieving, general, peace, through, his, balance, of, power, strategy, when, william, ii, became, emperor, in, 1888, he, discarded, bismarck, began, using, bellicose, language, and, planned, to, build, a, navy, to, rival, britain, s, ever, since, britain, had, taken, control, of, south, africa, from, the, netherlands, in, the, napoleonic, wars, it, had, run, afoul, of, the, dutch, settlers, who, further, away, and, created, two, republics, of, their, own, the, british, imperial, vision, called, for, control, over, the, new, countries, and, the, dutch, speaking, boers, or, afrikaners, fought, back, in, the, war, in, 1899, british, historian, andrew, roberts, argues, that, the, boers, insisted, on, keeping, full, control, of, both, their, two, small, republics, allowing, no, role, whatever, for, nonwhites, and, distinctly, limited, roles, for, british, and, other, european, settlers, these, uitlanders, were, the, base, of, the, economy, paid, 80, of, the, taxes, and, had, no, vote, the, transvaal, was, in, no, sense, a, democracy, argues, roberts, for, no, black, briton, catholic, or, jew, was, allowed, to, vote, or, hold, any, office, johannesburg, was, the, business, centre, with, 50, 000, primarily, british, residents, but, was, not, permitted, any, local, government, the, english, language, was, banned, in, official, proceedings, no, public, meetings, were, permitted, newspapers, were, closed, down, arbitrarily, and, full, citizenship, was, technically, possible, but, quite, rare, roberts, says, president, paul, kruger, ran, a, tight, tough, quasi, police, state, from, his, state, capital, pretoria, the, british, government, officially, protested, while, theoretically, recognizing, the, transvaal, s, right, to, manage, its, internal, affairs, cabinet, member, joseph, chamberlain, detailed, the, many, ways, how, uitlanders, were, mistreated, as, second, class, non, citizens, despite, their, essential, role, in, producing, prosperity, the, boer, response, to, the, british, pressure, was, to, declare, war, on, 20, october, 1899, the, 410, 000, boers, were, massively, outnumbered, but, amazingly, they, waged, a, successful, guerrilla, war, which, gave, the, british, regulars, a, difficult, fight, the, boers, were, landlocked, and, did, not, have, access, to, outside, help, the, weight, of, numbers, superior, equipment, and, often, brutal, tactics, eventually, brought, about, a, british, victory, to, defeat, the, guerrillas, the, british, rounded, up, their, women, and, children, into, concentration, camps, where, many, died, of, disease, world, outrage, focused, on, the, camps, led, by, a, large, faction, of, the, liberal, party, in, britain, however, the, united, states, gave, its, support, the, boer, republics, were, merged, into, union, of, south, africa, in, 1910, it, had, internal, self, government, but, its, foreign, policy, was, controlled, by, london, and, was, an, integral, part, of, the, british, empire, the, unexpectedly, great, difficulty, in, defeating, the, boers, forced, a, reevaluation, of, british, policy, in, military, terms, it, was,

demonstrated, that, britain, was, not, loved, around, the, world, it, had, more, enemies, than, friends, and, its, policy, of, splendid, isolation, was, one, of, high, risk, it, needed, new, friends, it, made, a, military, alliance, with, japan, and, buried, old, controversies, to, forge, a, close, relationship, with, the, united, states, part, of, the, agreement, which, led, to, the, acts, of,

was, divided, between, conservatives, and, liberals, however, when, gladstone, committed, to, home, rule, for, ireland, britain, s, upper, classes, largely, abandoned, the, liberal, party, giving, the, conservatives, a, large, permanent, majority, in, the, house, of, lords, high, society, in, london, following, the, queen, largely, ostracized, home, rulers, and, liberal, clubs, were, badly, split, joseph, chamberlain, took, a, major, element, of, upper, class, supporters, out, of, the, party, and, into, a, third, party, the, liberal, unionists, which, collaborated, with, and, eventually, merged, into, the, conservative, party, the, gladstonian, liberals, in, 1891, adopted, the, newcastle, programme, that, included, home, rule, for, ireland, disestablishment, of, the, church, of, england, in, wales, and, scotland, tighter, controls, on, the, sale, of, liquor, major, extension, of, factory, regulation, and, various, democratic, political, reforms, the, programme, had, a, strong, appeal, to, the, nonconformist, middle, class, liberal, element, which, felt, liberated, by, the, departure, of, the, aristocracy, queen, victoria, played, a, small, role, in, politics, but, became, the, iconic, symbol, of, the, nation, the, empire, and, proper, restrained, behaviour, her, strength, lay, in, good, common, sense, and, directness, of, character, she, expressed, the, qualities, of, the, british, nation, which, at, that, time, made, it, preeminent, in, the, world, as, a, symbol, of, domesticity, endurance, and, empire, and, as, a, woman, holding, the, highest, public, office, during, an, age, when, middle, and, upper, class, women, were, expected, to, beautify, the, home, while, men, dominated, the, public, sphere, queen, victoria, s, influence, has, been, enduring, her, success, as, ruler, was, due, to, the, power, of, the, self, images, she, successively, portrayed, of, innocent, young, woman, devoted, wife, and, mother, suffering, and, patient, widow, and, grandmotherly, matriarch, lord, palmerston, dominated, foreign, policy, for, decades, through, a, period, when, britain, was, at, the, height, of, its, power, serving, terms, as, both, foreign, secretary, and, prime, minister, he, became, controversial, at, the, time, and, remains, so, today, for, his, aggressive, bullying, and, his, liberal, interventionist, policies, he, was, intensely, patriotic, he, used, the, royal, navy, to, undermine, the, atlantic, slave, trade, disraeli, and, gladstone, dominated, the, politics, of, the, late, 19th, century, britain, s, golden, age, of, parliamentary, government, they, long, were, idolized, but, historians, in, recent, decades, have, become, much, more, critical, especially, regarding, disraeli, benjamin, disraeli, prime, minister, 1868, and, 1874, 1880, remains, an, iconic, hero, of, the, conservative, party, he, played, a, central, role, in, the, creation, of, the, party, defining, its, policies, and, its, broad, outreach, disraeli, is, remembered, for, his, influential, voice, in, world, affairs, his, political, battles, with, the, liberal, leader, william, gladstone, and, his, one, nation, conservatism, or, tory, democracy, he, made, the, conservatives, the, party, most, identified, with, the, glory, and, power, of, the, british, empire, he, was, born, into, a, jewish, family, which, became, episcopalian, when, he, was, 12, years, old, disraeli, fought, to, protect, established, political, social, and, religious, values, and, elites, he, emphasized, the, need, for, national, leadership, in, response, to, radicalism, uncertainty, and, materialism, he, is, especially, known, for, his, enthusiastic, support, for, expanding, and, strengthening, the, british, empire, in, india, and, africa, as, the, foundation, of, british, greatness, in, contrast, to, gladstone, s, negative, attitude, toward, imperialism, gladstone, denounced, disraeli, s, policies, of, territorial, aggrandizement, military, pomp, and, imperial, symbolism, such, as, making, the, queen, empress, of, india, saying, it, did, not, fit, a, modern, commercial, and, christian, nation, in, foreign, policy, he, is, best, known, for, battling, and, besting, russia, disraeli, s, second, term, was, dominated, by, the, eastern, question, the, slow, decay, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, desire, of, russia, to, gain, at, its, expense, disraeli, arranged, for, the, british, to, purchase, a, major, interest, in, the, suez, canal, company, in, ottoman, controlled, egypt, in, 1878, faced, with, russian, victories, against, the, ottomans, he, worked, at, the, congress, of, berlin, to, maintain, peace, in, the, balkans, and, made, terms, favourable, to, britain, which, weakened, russia, its, longstanding, enemy, disraeli, s, old, reputation, as, the, tory, democrat, and, promoter, of, the, welfare, state, has, faded, as, historians, argue, that, he, had, few, proposals, for, social, legislation, in, 1874, 1880, and, that, the, 1867, reform, act, did, not, reflect, a, vision, for, the, unenfranchised, working, man, however, he, did, work, to, reduce, class, antagonism, for, as, perry, notes, when, confronted, with, specific, problems, he, sought, to, reduce, tension, between, town, and, country, landlords, and, farmers, capital, and, labour, and, warring, religious, sects, in, britain, and, ireland, in, other, words, to, create, a, unifying, synthesis, william, ewart, gladstone, was, the, liberal, counterpart, to, disraeli, serving, as, prime, minister, four, times, 1868, 1874, 1880, 1885, 1886, and, 1892, 1894, he, was, the, moral, compass, of, the, liberal, party, and, is, famous, for, his, oratory, his, religiosity, his, liberalism, his, rivalry, with, disraeli, and, for, his, poor, relations, with, the, queen, although, he, personally, was, not, a, nonconformist, and, rather, disliked, them, in, person, he, formed, a, coalition, with, the, nonconformists, that, gave, the, liberals, a, powerful, base, of, support, gladstone, s, first, ministry, saw, many, reforms, including, disestablishment, of, the, protestant, church, of, ireland, and, the, introduction, of, secret, voting, his, party, was, defeated, in, 1874, but, made, a, comeback, based, on, opposition, to, the, ottoman, empire, s, bulgarian, atrocities, against, christians, gladstone, s, midlothian, campaign, of, 1879, 1880, was, a, pathbreaking, introduction, of, many, modern, political, campaigning, techniques, his, liberal, party, was, increasingly, pulled, apart, on, the, irish, issue, he, proposed, irish, home, rule, in, 1886, it, failed, to, pass, and, the, resulting, split, in, the, liberal, party, kept, it, out, of, office, for, most, of, the, next, 20, years, gladstone, s, financial, policies, based, on, the, notion, of, balanced, budgets, low, taxes, and, laissez, faire, were, suited, to, a, developing, capitalist, society, but, could, not, respond, effectively, as, economic, and, social, conditions, changed, called, the, grand, old, man, later, in, life, he, was, always, a, dynamic, popular, orator, who, appealed, strongly, to, british, workers, and, lower, middle, class, the, deeply, religious, gladstone, brought, a, new, moral, tone, to, politics, with, his, evangelical, sensibility, and, opposition, to, aristocracy, his, moralism, often, angered, his, upper, class, opponents, including, queen, victoria, who, strongly, favoured, disraeli, and, his, heavy, handed, control, split, the, liberal, party, his, foreign, policy, goal, was, to, create, a, european, order, based, on, cooperation, rather, than, conflict, and, mutual, trust, instead, of, rivalry, and, suspicion, the, rule, of, law, was, to, supplant, the, reign, of, force, and, self, interest, this, gladstonian, concept, of, a, harmonious, concert, of, europe, was, opposed, to, and, ultimately, defeated, by, the, germans, with, a, bismarckian, system, of, manipulated, alliances, and, antagonisms, regarding, ireland, the, major, liberal, efforts, focused, on, land, reform, with, the, land, acts, and, the, disestablishment, of, the, anglican, church, of, ireland, through, the, irish, church, act, 1869, gladstone, became, a, champion, of, home, rule, but, it, caused, a, deep, split, in, the, liberal, party, joseph, chamberlain, formed, the, breakaway, liberal, unionist, party, that, refused, to, consider, home, rule, for, ireland, and, became, allied, with, the, conservatives, in, terms, of, historic, reforms, gladstone, s, first, ministry, 1868, 1874, was, his, most, successful, he, was, an, idealist, who, insisted, that, government, should, take, the, lead, in, making, society, more, efficient, more, fair, and, that, the, government, should, expand, its, role, in, society, in, order, to, extend, liberty, and, toleration, the, education, act, of, 1870, made, universal, schooling, a, major, national, policy, the, justice, system, was, made, up, of, multiple, overlapping, and, conflicting, courts, dating, back, centuries, the, judicature, act, of, 1873, merged, them, into, one, central, court, in, local, government, the, challenges, of, sanitation, and, clean, water, in, fast, growing, cities, were, met, with, new, powers, in, the, realm, of, public, health, local, government, was, streamlined, in, a, later, gladstone, ministry, and,

complete, the, duke, of, cambridge, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, forces, still, had, great, authority, despite, his, mediocre, abilities, historians, have, given, gladstone, high, marks, on, his, successful, reform, programme, historians, agree, that, lord, salisbury, as, foreign, minister, and, prime, minister, in, the, late, 19th, century, was, a, strong, and, effective, leader, in, foreign, affairs, he, had, a, superb, grasp, of, the, issues, and, proved, a, patient, pragmatic, practitioner, with, a, keen, understanding, of, britain, s, historic, interests, he, oversaw, the, partition, of, africa, the, emergence, of, germany, and, the, united, states, as, imperial, powers, and, the, transfer, of, british, attention, from, the, dardanelles, to, suez, without, provoking, a, serious, confrontation, of, the, great, powers, conservative, prime, minister, lord, salisbury, was, a, talented, leader, who, was, an, icon, of, traditional, aristocratic, conservatism, salisbury, was, a, great, foreign, minister, essentially, negative, indeed, reactionary, in, home, affairs, another, historian, s, estimate, is, more, favourable, he, portrays, salisbury, as, a, leader, who, held, back, the, popular, tide, for, twenty, years, nto, the, progressive, strain, of, modern, conservatism, he, simply, will, not, fit, one, historian, pointed, to, the, narrow, cynicism, of, salisbury, one, admirer, of, salisbury, agrees, that, salisbury, found, the, democracy, born, of, the, 1867, and, 1884, reform, acts, as, perhaps, less, objectionable, than, he, had, expected,

argues, that, lloyd, george, made, a, greater, impact, on, british, public, life, than, any, other, 20th, century, leader, thanks, to, his, pre, war, introduction, of, britain, s, social, welfare, system, especially, medical, insurance, unemployment, insurance, and, old, age, pensions, largely, paid, for, by, taxes, on, high, incomes, and, on, the, land, furthermore, in, foreign, affairs, he,

1910, 1936, scandal, free, hard, working, and, popular, george, v, was, the, british, monarch, who, with, queen, mary, established, the, modern, pattern, of, exemplary, conduct, for, british, royalty, based, on, middle, class, values, and, virtues, he, understood, the, overseas, empire, better, than, any, of, his, prime, ministers, and, used, his, exceptional, memory, for, figures, and, details, whether, of, uniforms, politics, or, relations, to, good, effect, in, reaching, out, in, conversation, with, his, subjects, the, era, was, prosperous, but, political, crises, were, escalating, out, of, control, george, dangerfield, 1935, identified, the, strange, death, of, liberal, england, as, the, multiple, crisis, that, hit, simultaneously, in, 1910, 1914, with, serious, social, and, political, instability, arising, from, the, irish, crisis, labour, unrest, the, women, s, suffrage, movements, and, partisan, and, constitutional, struggles, in, parliament, at, one, point, it, even,

a, progressive, alliance, of, labour, and, off, and, on, irish, nationalists, the, coalition, was, committed, to, free, trade, as, opposed, to, the, high, tariffs, the, conservatives, sought, free, collective, bargaining, for, trades, unions, which, conservatives, opposed, an, active, social, policy, that, was, forging, the, welfare, state, and, constitutional, reform, to, reduce, the, power, of, the, house, of, lords, the, coalition, lacked, a, long, term, plan, because, it, was, cobbled, together, from, leftovers, from, the, 1890s, the, sociological, basis, was, non, anglican, religion,

to, support, france, that, would, deeply, split, the, party, and, mean, loss, of, control, of, the, government, to, a, coalition, or, to, the, unionist, i, e, conservative, opposition, however, the, large, antiwar, element, among, liberals, with, david, lloyd, george, as, spokesperson, would, support, the, war, to, honour, the, 1839, treaty, that, guaranteed, belgian, neutrality, so, belgium, rather, than, france, was, the, public, reason, given, posters, took, the, line, that, britain, was, required, to, go, to, war, to, safeguard, belgium, s, neutrality, under, the, 1839, treaty, of,

effective, david, lloyd, george, he, had, strong, support, from, unionists, and, considerable, backing, of, labour, as, well, as, a, majority, of, his, own, liberal, party, although, asquith, turned, hostile, lloyd, george, answered, the, loud, demands, for, a, much, more, decisive, government, by, setting, up, a, new, small, war, cabinet, a, cabinet, secretariat, under, maurice, hankey, and, a,

problem, was, that, the, american, market, was, so, much, larger, and, richer, it, bought, up, the, top, talent, especially, when, hollywood, came, to, the, fore, in, the, 1920s, and, produced, over,

but, fewer, warplanes, the, smashing, german, victory, in, spring, 1940, was, due, entirely, to, superior, combat, doctrine, realistic, training, imaginative, battlefield, leadership, and, unparalleled, initiative, from, generals, down, to, sergeants, the, british, with, the, thinnest, of, margins, rescued, its, main, army, from, dunkirk, as, well, as, many, french, soldiers, leaving,

royal, navy, was, prepared, to, repel, first, the, germans, tried, to, achieve, air, supremacy, but, were, defeated, by, the, royal, air, force, in, the, battle, of, britain, in, late, summer, 1940,

accepting, large, amounts, of, lend, lease, from, the, u, s, and, canada, the, us, gave, 30, billion, in, munitions, canada, also, gave, aid, the, american, and, canadian, aid, did, not, have, to, be, repaid, but, there, were, also, american, loans, that, were, repaid, britain, s, total, mobilisation, during, this, period, proved, to, be, successful, in, winning, the, war, by, maintaining, strong, support, from, public, opinion, the, war, was, a, people, s, war, that, enlarged, democratic, aspirations, and, produced, promises, of, a, postwar, welfare, state, the, media, called, it, a, people, s, war, a, term, that, caught, on, and, signified, the, popular, demand, for, planning, and, an, expanded, welfare, state, the, royal, family, played, major, symbolic, roles, in, the, war, they, refused, to, leave, london, during, the, blitz, and, were, indefatigable, in, visiting, troops, munition, factories, dockyards, and, hospitals, all, over, the, country, all, social, classes, appreciated, how, the, royals, shared, the, hopes, fears, and, hardships, of, the, people, historians, credit, britain, with, a, highly, successful, record, of, mobilising, the, home, front, for, the, war, effort, in, terms, of, mobilising, the, greatest, proportion, of, potential, workers, maximising, output, assigning, the, right, skills, to, the, right, task, and, maintaining, the, morale, and, spirit, of, the, people, much, of, this, success, was, due, to, the, systematic, planned, mobilisation, of, women, as, workers, soldiers, and, housewives, enforced, after, december, 1941, by, conscription, women, supported, the, war, effort, and, made, the, rationing, of, consumer, goods, a, success, in, some, ways, the, government, over, responded, evacuating, too, many, children, in, the, first, days, of, the, war, closing, cinemas, as, frivolous, then, reopening, them, when, the, need, for, cheap, entertainment, became, clear, sacrificing, cats, and, dogs, to, save, a, little, space, on, shipping, pet, food, only, to, discover, an, urgent, need, to, keep, rats, and, mice, under, control, the, british, relied, successfully, on, voluntarism, munitions, production, rose, dramatically, and, the, quality, remained, high, food, production, was, emphasised, in, large, part, to, free, shipping, for, munitions, farmers, increased, the, area, under, cultivation, from, 12, 000, 000, to, 18, 000, 000, acres, from, about, 50, 000, to, 75, 000, km, 2, and, the, farm, labour, force, was, expanded, by, a, fifth, thanks, especially, to, the, women, s, land, army, the, success, of, the, government, in, providing, new, services, such, as, hospitals, and, school, lunches, as, well, as, egalitarian, spirit, contributed, to, widespread, support, for, an, enlarged, welfare, state, it, was, supported, by, the, coalition, government, and, all, major, parties, welfare, conditions, especially, regarding, food, improved, during, the, war, as, the, government, imposed, rationing, and, subsidized, food, prices, conditions, for, housing, however, worsened, with, the, bombing, and, clothing, was, in, short, supply, equality, increased, dramatically, as, incomes, declined, sharply, for, the, wealthy, and, for, white, collar, workers, as, their, taxes, soared, while, blue, collar, workers, benefited, from, rationing, and, price, controls, people, demanded, an, expansion, of, the, welfare, state, as, a, reward, to, the, people, for, their, wartime, sacrifices, the, goal, was, operationalized, in, a, famous, report, by, william, beveridge, it, recommended, that, the, various, income, maintenance, services, that, had, grown, up, piecemeal, since, 1911, be, systematized, and, made, universal, unemployment, benefits, and, sickness, benefits, were, to, be, universal, there, would, be, new, benefits, for, maternity, the, old, age, pension, system, would, be, revised, and, expanded, and, require, that, a, person, retired, a, full, scale, national, health, service, would, provide, free, medical, care, for, everyone, all, the, major, parties, endorsed, the, principles, and, they, were, largely, put, into, effect, when, peace, returned, britain, had, won, the, war, but, it, lost, india, in, 1947, and, nearly, all, the, rest, of, the, empire, by, the, 1960s, it, debated, its, role, in, world, affairs, and, joined, the, united, nations, in, 1945, nato, in, 1949, and, became, a, close, ally, of, the, united, states, prosperity, returned, in, the, 1950s, and, london, remained, a, world, centre, of, finance, and, culture, but, the, nation, was, no, longer, a, major, world, power, in, 1973, after, a, long, debate, and, initial, rejection, it, joined, the, common, market, the, end, of, the, war, saw, a, landslide, victory, for, clement, attlee, and, the, labour, party, they, were, elected, on, a, manifesto, of, greater, social, justice, with, left, wing, policies, such, as, the, creation, of, a, national, health, service, more, council, housing, and, nationalisation, of, several, major, industries, britain, faced, a, severe, financial, crisis, and, responded, by, reducing, her, international, responsibilities, and, by, sharing, the, hardships, of, an, age, of, austerity, large, loans, from, the, united, states, and, marshall, plan, grants, helped, rebuild, and, modernise, its, infrastructure, and, business, practices, rationing, and, conscription, dragged, on, well, into, the, post, war, years, and, the, country, suffered, one, of, the, worst, winters, on, record, nevertheless, morale, was, boosted, by, events, such, as, the, marriage, of, princess, elizabeth, in, 1947, and, the, festival, of, britain, in, 1951, labour, party, experts, went, into, the, files, to, find, the, detailed, plans, for, nationalisation, to, their, surprise, there, were, no, plans, the, leaders, decided, to, act, fast, to, keep, up, the, momentum, of, the, 1945, electoral, landslide, they, started, with, the, bank, of, england, civil, aviation, coal, and, cable, wireless, then, came, railways, canals, road, haulage, and, trucking, electricity, and, gas, finally, came, iron, and, steel, which, was, a, special, case, because, it, was, a, manufacturing, industry, altogether, about, one, fifth, of, the, economy, was, nationalised, labour, dropped, its, plans, to, nationalise, farmlands, the, procedure, used, was, developed, by, herbert, morrison, who, as, lord, president, of, the, council, chaired, the, committee, on, the, socialization, of, industries, he, followed, the, model, that, had, already, been, used, to, establish, public, corporations, such, as, the, bbc, 1927, in, exchange, for, the, shares, the, owners, of, the, companies, were, given, government, bonds, paying, low, rates, of, interest, and, the, government, took, full, ownership, of, each, affected, company, consolidating, it, into, a, national, monopoly, the, management, remained, the, same, but, they, were, now, effectively, civil, servants, working, for, the, government, for, the, labour, party, leadership, nationalisation, was, a, way, to, consolidate, economic, planning, in, their, own, hands, it, was, not, designed, to, modernise, old, industries, make, them, efficient, or, transform, their, organisational, structure, there, was, no, money, for, modernisation, although, the, marshall, plan, operated, separately, by, american, planners, did, force, many, british, businesses, to, adopt, modern, managerial, techniques, hardline, socialists, were, disappointed, as, the, nationalised, industries, seemed, identical, to, the, old, private, corporations, and, national, planning, was, made, virtually, impossible, by, the, government, s, financial, constraints, socialism, was, in, place, but, it, did, not, seem, to, make, a, major, difference, rank, and, file, workers, had, long, been, motivated, to, support, labour, by, tales, of, the, mistreatment, of, workers, by, foremen, and, the, management, the, foremen, and, the, managers, were, the, same, people, as, before, with, much, the, same, power, over, the, workplace, there, was, no, worker, control, of, industry, the, unions, resisted, government, efforts, to, set, wages, by, the, time, of, the, general, elections, in, 1950, and, 1951, labour, seldom, boasted, about, nationalisation, of, industry, instead, it, was, the, conservatives, who, decried, the, inefficiency, and, mismanagement, and, promised, to, reverse, the, takeover, of, steel, and, trucking, as, the, country, headed, into, the, 1950s, rebuilding, continued, and, a, number, of, immigrants, from, the, remaining, british, empire, mostly, the, caribbean, and, the, indian, subcontinent, were, invited, to, help, the, rebuilding, effort, as, the, 1950s, wore, on, britain, lost, its, place, as, a, superpower, and, could, no, longer, maintain, its, large, empire, this, led, to, decolonisation, and, a, withdrawal, from, almost, all, of, its, colonies, by, 1970, events, such, as, the, suez, crisis, showed, that, the, uk, s, status, had, fallen, in, the, world, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, were, however, relatively, prosperous, times, after, the, second, world, war, and, saw, the, beginning, of, a, modernisation, of, the, uk, with, the, construction, of, its, first, motorways, for, example, and, also, during, the, 1960s, a, great, cultural, movement, began, which, expanded, across, the, world, unemployment, was, relatively, low, during, this, period, and, the, standard, of, living, continued, to, rise, with, more, new, private, and, council, housing, developments, taking, place, and, the, number, of, slum, properties, diminishing, the, postwar, period, also, witnessed, a, dramatic, rise, in, the, average, standard, of, living, as, characterised, by, a, 40, rise, in, average, real, wages, from, 1950, to, 1965, earnings, for, men, in, industry, rose, by, 95, between, 1951, and, 1964, while, during, that, same, period, the, official, workweek, was, reduced, and, five, reductions, in, income, tax, were, made, those, in, traditionally, poorly, paid, semi, skilled, and, unskilled, occupations, saw, a, particularly, marked, improvement, in, their, wages, and, living, standards, as, summed, up, by, r, j, unstead, opportunities, in, life, if, not, equal, were, distributed, much, more, fairly, than, ever, before, and, the, weekly, wage, earner, in, particular, had, gained, standards, of, living, that, would, have, been, almost, unbelievable, in, the, thirties, in, 1950, the, uk, standard, of, living, was, higher, than, in, any, eec, country, apart, from, belgium, it, was, 50, higher, than, the, west, german, standard, of, living, and, twice, as, high, as, the, italian, standard, of, living, by, the, earlier, seventies, however, the, uk, standard, of, living, was, lower, than, all, eec, countries, apart, from, italy, which, according, to, one, calculation, was, roughly, equal, to, britain, in, 1951, the, average, weekly, earnings, of, men, over, the, age, of, 21, stood, at, 8, 6s, 0d, and, nearly, doubled, a, decade, later, to, 15, 7s, 0d, by, 1966, average, weekly, earnings, stood, at, 20, 6s, 0d, between, 1964, and, 1968, the, percentage, of, households, with, a, television, set, rose, from, 80, 5, to, 85, 5, a, washing, machine, from, 54, to, 63, a, refrigerator, from, 35, to, 55, a, car, from, 38, to, 49, a, telephone, from, 21, 5, to, 28, and, central, heating, from, 13, to, 23, between, 1951, and, 1963, wages, rose, by, 72, while, prices, rose, by, 45, enabling, people, to, afford, more, consumer, goods, than, ever, before, between, 1955, and, 1967, the, average, earnings, of, weekly, paid, workers, increased, by, 96, and, those, of, salaried, workers, by, 95, while, prices, rose, by, about, 45, in, the, same, period, the, rising, affluence, of, the, fifties, and, sixties, was, underpinned, by, sustained, full, employment, and, a, dramatic, rise, in, workers, wages, in, 1950, the, average, weekly, wage, stood, at, 6, 8s, compared, with, 11, 2s, 6d, in, 1959, as, a, result, of, wage, rises, consumer, spending, also, increased, by, about, 20, during, this, same, period, while, economic, growth, remained, at, about, 3, in, addition, food, rations, were, lifted, in, 1954, while, hire, purchase, controls, were, relaxed, in, the, same, year, as, a, result, of, these, changes, large, numbers, of, the, working, classes, were, able, to, participate, in, the, consumer, market, for, the, first, time, as, noted, by, harriet, wilson, national, wealth, has, grown, considerably, and, although, the, shareout, of, this, among, the, social, classes, has, remained, substantially, of, the, same, proportions, it, has, meant, a, considerable, rise, in, the, standard, of, living, of, all, classes, it, is, estimated, that, in, britain, at, the, turn, of, the, century, average, earnings, in, industry, sufficed, merely, to, meet, the, essential, needs, of, a, two, child, family, today, average, earnings, allow, the, industrial, wage, earner, to, spend, a, third, of, his, income, on, things, other, than, basic, needs, the, significant, real, wage, increases, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, contributed, to, a, rapid, increase, in, working, class, consumerism, with, british, consumer, spending, rising, by, 45, between, 1952, and, 1964, in, addition, entitlement, to, various, fringe, benefits, was, improved, in, 1955, 96, of, manual, labourers, were, entitled, to, two, weeks, holiday, with, pay, compared, with, 61, in, 1951, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, britain, had, become, one, of, the, world, s, most, affluent, countries, and, by, the, early, sixties, most, britons, enjoyed, a, level, of, prosperity, that, had, previously, been, known, only, to, a, small, minority, of, the, population, for, the, young, and, unattached, there, was, for, the, first, time, in, decades, spare, cash, for, leisure, clothes, and, luxuries, in, 1959, queen, magazine, declared, that, britain, has, launched, into, an, age, of, unparalleled, lavish, living, average, wages, were, high, while, jobs, were, plentiful, and, people, saw, their, personal, prosperity, climb, even, higher, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, claimed, that, the, luxuries, of, the, rich, have, become, the, necessities, of, the, poor, levels, of, disposable, income, rose, steadily, with, the, spending, power, of, the, average, family, rising, by, 50, between, 1951, and, 1979, and, by, the, end, of, the, seventies, 6, out, of, 10, families, had, come, to, own, a, car, as, noted, by, martin, pugh, keynesian, economic, management, enabled, british, workers, to, enjoy, a, golden, age, of, full, employment, which, combined, with, a, more, relaxed, attitude, towards, working, mothers, led, to, the, spread, of, the, two, income, family, inflation, was, around, 4, per, cent, money, wages, rose, from, an, average, of, 8, a, week, in, 1951, to, 15, a, week, by, 1961, home, ownership, spread, from, 35, per, cent, in, 1939, to, 47, per, cent, by, 1966, and, the, relaxation, of, credit, controls, boosted, the, demand, for, consumer, goods, by, 1963, 82, of, all, private, households, had, a, television, 72, a, vacuum, cleaner, 45, a, washing, machine, and, 30, a, refrigerator, in, addition, as, noted, by, john, burnett, what, was, equally, striking, was, that, ownership, of, such, things, had, spread, down, the, social, scale, and, the, gap, between, professional, and, manual, workers, had, considerably, narrowed, a, study, of, a, slum, area, in, leeds, which, was, due, for, demolition, found, that, 74, of, the, households, had, a, television, 41, a, vacuum, and, 38, a, washing, machine, in, another, slum, area, st, mary, s, in, oldham, where, in, 1970, few, of, the, houses, had, fixed, baths, or, a, hot, water, supply, and, half, shared, outside, toilets, 67, of, the, houses, were, rated, as, comfortably, furnished, and, a, further, 24, furnished, luxuriously, with, smart, modern, furniture, deep, pile, carpeting, and, decorations, the, provision, of, household, amenities, steadily, improved, during, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, from, 1971, to, 1983, households, having, the, sole, use, of, a, fixed, bath, or, shower, rose, from, 88, to, 97, and, those, with, an, internal, wc, from, 87, to, 97, in, addition, the, number, of, households, with, central, heating, almost, doubled, during, that, same, period, from, 34, to, 64, by, 1983, 94, of, all, households, had, a, refrigerator, 81, a, colour, television, 80, a, washing, machine, 57, a, deep, freezer, and, 28, a, tumble, drier, between, 1950, and, 1970, however, britain, was, overtaken, by, most, of, the, countries, of, the, european, common, market, in, terms, of, the, number, of, telephones, refrigerators, television, sets, cars, and, washing, machines, per, 100, of, the, population, although, britain, remained, high, in, terms, of, bathrooms, and, lavatories, per, 100, people, although, the, british, standard, of, living, was, increasing, the, standard, of, living, in, other, countries, increased, faster, according, to, a, 1968, study, by, anthony, sampson, british, workers, in, ten, years, from, having, had, a, much, higher, standard, of, living, than, the, continent, they, have, slipped, right, back, taking, the, national, income, per, head, a, rough, yardstick, the, british, by, 1967, had, sunk, to, eighth, place, among, oecd, countries, with, an, annual, income, of, 1, 910, compared, with, 2, 010, for, germany, 2, 060, for, france, and, 2, 480, for, switzerland, and, britain, s, falling, position, already, shows, itself, in, the, lower, proportion, of, new, cars, and, new, houses, though, still, leading, with, tv, sets, and, washing, machines, in, 1976, uk, wages, were, amongst, the, lowest, in, western, europe, being, half, of, west, german, rates, and, two, thirds, of, italian, rates, in, addition, while, educational, opportunities, for, working, class, people, had, widened, significantly, since, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, a, number, of, developed, countries, came, to, overtake, britain, in, some, educational, indicators, by, the, early, 1980s, some, 80, to, 90, of, school, leavers, in, france, and, west, germany, received, vocational, training, compared, with, 40, in, the, united, kingdom, by, the, mid, 1980s, over, 80, of, pupils, in, the, united, states, and, west, germany, and, over, 90, in, japan, stayed, in, education, until, the, age, of, eighteen, compared, with, barely, 33, of, british, pupils, in, 1987, only, 35, of, 16, to, 18, year, olds, were, in, full, time, education, or, training, compared, with, 80, in, the, united, states, 77, in, japan, 69, in, france, and, 49, in, the, united, kingdom, there, also, remained, gaps, between, manual, and, non, manual, workers, in, areas, such, as, fringe, benefits, and, wage, levels, in, april, 1978, for, instance, male, full, time, manual, workers, aged, 21, and, above, averaged, a, gross, weekly, wage, of, 80, 70, while, the, equivalent, for, male, white, collar, workers, stood, at, 100, 70, britain, s, control, over, its, empire, loosened, during, the, interwar, period, nationalism, strengthened, in, other, parts, of, the, empire, particularly, in, india, and, in, egypt, between, 1867, and, 1910, the, uk, had, granted, australia, canada, and, new, zealand, dominion, status, near, complete, autonomy, within, the, empire, they, became, charter, members, of, the, british, commonwealth, of, nations, known, as, the, commonwealth, of, nations, since, 1949, an, informal, but, close, knit, association, that, succeeded, the, british, empire, beginning, with, the, independence, of, india, and, pakistan, in, 1947, the, remainder, of, the, british, empire, was, almost, completely, dismantled, today, most, of, britain, s, former, colonies, belong, to, the, commonwealth, almost, all, of, them, as, independent, members, there, are, however, 13, former, british, colonies, including, bermuda, gibraltar, the, falkland, islands, and, others, which, have, elected, to, continue, rule, by, london, and, are, known, as, british, overseas, territories, in, the, 1960s, moderate, unionist, prime, minister, of, northern, ireland, terence, o, neill, tried, to, reform, the, system, and, give, a, greater, voice, to, catholics, who, comprised, 40, of, the, population, of, northern, ireland, his, goals, were, blocked, by, militant, protestants, led, by, the, rev, ian, paisley, the, increasing, pressures, from, nationalists, for, reform, and, from, unionists, to, resist, reform, led, to, the, appearance, of, the, civil, rights, movement, under, figures, like, john, hume, austin, currie, and, others, clashes, escalated, out, of, control, as, the, army, could, barely, contain, the, provisional, irish, republican, army, ira, and, the, ulster, defence, association, british, leaders, feared, their, withdrawal, would, give, a, doomsday, scenario, with, widespread, communal, strife, followed, by, the, mass, exodus, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, refugees, london, shut, down, northern, ireland, s, parliament, and, began, direct, rule, by, the, 1990s, the, failure, of, the, ira, campaign, to, win, mass, public, support, or, achieve, its, aim, of, a, british, withdrawal, led, to, negotiations, that, in, 1998, produced, the, good, friday, agreement, it, won, popular, support, and, largely, ended, the, troubles, after, the, relative, prosperity, of, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, uk, experienced, industrial, strife, and, stagflation, through, the, 1970s, following, a, global, economic, downturn, labour, had, returned, to, government, in, 1964, under, harold, wilson, to, end, 13, years, of, conservative, rule, the, conservatives, were, restored, to, government, in, 1970, under, edward, heath, who, failed, to, halt, the, country, s, economic, decline, and, was, ousted, in, 1974, as, labour, returned, to, power, under, harold, wilson, the, economic, crisis, deepened, following, wilson, s, return, and, things, fared, little, better, under, his, successor, james, callaghan, a, strict, modernisation, of, its, economy, began, under, the, controversial, conservative, leader, margaret, thatcher, following, her, election, as, prime, minister, in, 1979, which, saw, a, time, of, record, unemployment, as, deindustrialisation, saw, the, end, of, much, of, the, country, s, manufacturing, industries, but, also, a, time, of, economic, boom, as, stock, markets, became, liberalised, and, state, owned, industries, were, privatised, her, rise, to, power, was, seen, as, the, symbolic, end, of, the, time, in, which, the, british, economy, had, become, the, sick, man, of, western, europe, inflation, also, fell, during, this, period, and, trade, union, power, was, reduced, however, the, miners, strike, of, 1984, 1985, sparked, the, end, of, most, of, the, uk, s, coal,
