to, the, presidency, of, mexico, in, 1876, and, remained, almost, continuously, in, office, until, 1911, in, an, era, now, called, porfiriato, coming, to, power, after, a, coup, to, oppose, the, re, election, of, sebasti, n, lerdo, de, tejada, he, could, not, run, for, re, election, in, 1880, his, close, ally, general, manuel, gonz, lez, was, elected, president, 1880, 1884, d, az, saw, himself, as, indispensable, and, after, that, interregnum, ran, for, the, presidency, again, and, served, in, office, continuously, until, 1911, the, constitution, had, been, amended, to, allow, unlimited, presidential, re, election, during, the, porfiriato, there, were, regular, elections, widely, considered, sham, exercises, marked, by, contentious, irregularities, in, his, early, years, in, the, presidency, d, az, consolidated, power, by, playing, opposing, factions, against, each, other, and, by, expanding, the, rurales, an, armed, police, militia, directly, under, his, control, that, seized, land, from, local, peasants, peasants, were, forced, to, make, futile, attempts, to, win, back, their, land, through, courts, and, petitions, by, 1900, over, ninety, percent, of, mexico, s, communal, lands, were, sold, with, an, estimated, 9, 5, million, peasants, forced, into, the, service, of, wealthy, landowners, or, hacendados, diaz, rigged, elections, arguing, that, only, he, knew, what, was, best, for, his, country, and, he, enforced, his, belief, with, a, strong, hand, order, and, progress, were, the, watchwords, of, his, rule, d, az, s, presidency, was, characterized, by, the, promotion, of, industry, and, the, development, of, infrastructure, by, opening, the, country, to, foreign, investment, d, az, suppressed, opposition, and, promoted, stability, to, reassure, foreign, investors, farmers, and, peasants, both, complained, of, oppression, and, exploitation, the, situation, was, further, exacerbated, by, the, drought, that, lasted, from, 1907, to, 1909, the, economy, took, a, great, leap, during, the, porfiriato, through, the, construction, of, factories, industries, and, infrastructure, such, as, railroads, and, dams, as, well, as, improving, agriculture, foreign, investors, bought, large, tracts, of, land, to, cultivate, crops, and, range, cattle, for, export, the, cultivation, of, exportable, goods, such, as, coffee, tobacco, henequen, for, cordage, and, sugar, replaced, the, domestic, production, of, wheat, corn, and, livestock, that, peasants, had, lived, on, wealth, political, power, and, access, to, education, were, concentrated, among, a, handful, of, elite, landholding, families, mainly, of, european, and, mixed, descent, these, hacendados, controlled, vast, swaths, of, the, country, through, their, huge, estates, for, example, the, terrazas, had, one, estate, in, sonora, that, alone, comprised, more, than, a, million, acres, many, mexicans, became, landless, peasants, laboring, on, these, vast, estates, or, industrial, workers, toiling, long, hours, for, low, wages, foreign, companies, mostly, from, the, united, kingdom, france, and, the, u, s, also, exercised, influence, in, mexico, d, az, had, legitimacy, as, a, leader, through, his, battlefield, accomplishments, he, knew, that, the, long, tradition, of, military, intervention, in, politics, and, its, resistance, to, civilian, control, would, prove, challenging, to, his, remaining, in, power, he, set, about, curbing, the, power, of, the, military, reining, in, provincial, military, chieftains, and, making, them, subordinate, to, the, central, government, he, contended, with, a, whole, new, group, of, generals, who, had, fought, for, the, liberal, cause, and, who, expected, rewards, for, their, services, he, systematically, dealt, with, them, providing, some, rivals, with, opportunities, to, enrich, themselves, ensuring, the, loyalty, of, others, with, high, salaries, and, others, were, bought, off, by, rewards, of, landed, estates, and, redirecting, their, political, ambitions, military, rivals, who, did, not, accept, the, alternatives, often, rebelled, and, were, crushed, it, took, him, some, 15, years, to, accomplish, the, transformation, reducing, the, army, by, 500, officers, and, 25, generals, creating, an, army, subordinate, to, central, power, he, also, created, the, military, academy, to, train, officers, but, their, training, was, aimed, at, repelling, foreign, invasions, d, az, expanded, the, rural, police, force, the, rurales, as, an, elite, guard, including, many, former, bandits, under, the, direct, control, of, the, president, with, these, forces, d, az, attempted, to, pacify, the, mexican, countryside, led, by, a, stable, government, that, was, nominally, civilian, and, the, conditions, to, develop, the, country, economically, with, the, infusion, of, foreign, investments, during, d, az, s, long, tenure, in, office, the, federal, army, became, overstaffed, and, top, heavy, with, officers, many, of, them, elderly, who, last, saw, active, military, service, against, the, french, in, the, 1860s, some, 9, 000, officers, commanded, the, 25, 000, rank, and, file, on, the, books, with, some, 7, 000, padding, the, rosters, and, nonexistent, so, that, officers, could, receive, the, subsidies, for, the, numbers, they, commanded, officers, used, their, position, for, personal, enrichment, through, salary, and, opportunities, for, graft, although, mexicans, had, enthusiastically, volunteered, in, the, war, against, the, french, the, ranks, were, now, filled, by, draftees, there, was, a, vast, gulf, between, officers, and, the, lower, ranks, the, officer, corps, epitomized, everything, the, masses, resented, about, the, d, az, system, with, multiple, rebellions, breaking, out, in, the, wake, of, the, fraudulent, 1910, election, the, military, was, unable, to, suppress, them, revealing, the, regime, s, weakness, and, leading, to, d, az, s, resignation, in, may, 1911, although, the, d, az, regime, was, authoritarian, and, centralizing, it, was, not, a, military, dictatorship, his, first, presidential, cabinet, was, staffed, with, military, men, but, over, successive, terms, as, president, important, posts, were, held, by, able, and, loyal, civilians, he, did, not, create, a, personal, dynasty, excluding, family, from, the, realms, of, power, although, his, nephew, f, lix, attempted, to, seize, power, after, the, fall, of, the, regime, in, 1911, d, az, created, a, political, machine, first, working, with, regional, strongmen, and, bringing, them, into, his, regime, then, replacing, them, with, jefes, pol, ticos, political, bosses, who, were, loyal, to, him, he, skillfully, managed, political, conflict, and, reined, in, tendencies, toward, autonomy, he, appointed, several, military, officers, to, state, governorships, including, general, bernardo, reyes, who, became, governor, of, the, northern, state, of, nuevo, le, n, but, over, the, years, military, men, were, largely, replaced, by, civilians, loyal, to, d, az, as, a, military, man, himself, and, one, who, had, intervened, directly, in, politics, to, seize, the, presidency, in, 1876, d, az, was, acutely, aware, that, the, federal, army, could, oppose, him, he, augmented, the, rurales, a, police, force, created, by, benito, ju, rez, making, them, his, private, armed, force, the, rurales, were, only, 2, 500, in, number, as, opposed, to, the, 30, 000, in, the, army, and, another, 30, 000, in, the, federal, auxiliaries, irregulars, and, national, guard, despite, their, small, numbers, the, rurales, were, highly, effective, in, controlling, the, countryside, especially, along, the, 12, 000, miles, of, railway, lines, they, were, a, mobile, force, often, sent, on, trains, with, their, horses, to, put, down, rebellions, in, relatively, remote, areas, of, mexico, the, construction, of, railways, had, been, transformative, in, mexico, as, well, as, elsewhere, in, latin, america, accelerating, economic, activity, and, increasing, the, power, of, the, mexican, state, the, isolation, from, the, central, government, that, many, remote, areas, had, enjoyed, or, suffered, was, ending, telegraph, lines, constructed, next, to, railroad, tracks, meant, instant, communication, between, distant, states, and, the, capital, the, political, acumen, and, flexibility, d, az, exhibited, in, his, early, years, in, office, began, to, decline, after, 1900, he, brought, the, state, governors, under, his, control, replacing, them, at, will, the, federal, army, while, large, was, increasingly, an, ineffective, force, with, aging, leadership, and, troops, conscripted, into, service, d, az, attempted, the, same, kind, of, manipulation, he, executed, with, the, mexican, political, system, with, business, interests, showing, favoritism, to, european, interests, against, those, of, the, u, s, rival, interests, particularly, those, of, the, foreign, powers, with, a, presence, in, mexico, further, complicated, an, already, complex, system, of, favoritism, as, economic, activity, increased, and, industries, thrived, industrial, workers, began, organizing, for, better, conditions, d, az, enacted, policies, that, encouraged, large, landowners, to, intrude, upon, the, villagers, land, and, water, rights, with, the, expansion, of, mexican, agriculture, landless, peasants, were, forced, to, work, for, low, wages, or, move, to, the, cities, peasant, agriculture, was, under, pressure, as, haciendas, expanded, such, as, in, the, state, of, morelos, just, south, of, mexico, city, with, its, burgeoning, sugar, plantations, there, was, what, one, scholar, has, called, agrarian, compression, in, which, population, growth, intersected, with, land, loss, declining, wages, and, insecure, tenancies, to, produce, widespread, economic, deterioration, but, the, regions, under, the, greatest, stress, were, not, the, ones, that, rebelled, d, az, suppressed, strikes, rebellions, and, political, opposition, effectively, until, the, early, 1900s, mexicans, began, to, organize, in, opposition, to, d, az, who, had, welcomed, foreign, capital, and, capitalists, suppressed, nascent, labor, unions, and, consistently, moved, against, peasants, as, agriculture, flourished, in, 1905, the, group, of, mexican, intellectuals, and, political, agitators, who, had, created, the, mexican, liberal, party, partido, liberal, de, m, xico, drew, up, a, radical, program, of, reform, specifically, addressing, what, they, considered, to, be, the, worst, aspects, of, the, d, az, regime, most, prominent, in, the, plm, were, ricardo, flores, mag, n, and, his, two, brothers, enrique, and, jes, s, they, along, with, luis, cabrera, and, antonio, d, az, soto, y, gama, were, connected, to, the, anti, d, az, publication, el, hijo, del, ahuizote, political, cartoons, by, jos, guadalupe, posada, lampooned, politicians, and, cultural, elites, with, mordant, humor, portraying, them, as, skeletons, the, liberal, party, of, mexico, founded, the, anti, d, az, anarchist, newspaper, regeneraci, n, which, appeared, in, both, spanish, and, english, in, exile, in, the, united, states, pr, xedis, guerrero, began, publishing, an, anti, d, az, newspaper, alba, roja, red, dawn, in, san, francisco, california, although, leftist, groups, were, small, in, numbers, they, became, influential, through, their, publications, articulating, their, opposition, to, the, d, az, regime, francisco, bulnes, described, these, men, as, the, true, authors, of, the, mexican, revolution, for, agitating, the, masses, as, the, 1910, election, approached, francisco, i, madero, an, emerging, political, figure, and, member, of, one, of, mexico, s, richest, families, funded, the, newspaper, anti, reelectionista, in, opposition, to, the, continual, re, election, of, d, az, organized, labor, conducted, strikes, for, better, wages, and, just, treatment, demands, for, better, labor, conditions, were, central, to, the, liberal, party, program, drawn, up, in, 1905, mexican, copper, miners, in, the, northern, state, of, sonora, took, action, in, the, 1906, cananea, strike, starting, on, june, 1, 1906, 5, 400, miners, began, to, organize, labor, strikes, among, other, grievances, they, were, paid, less, than, u, s, nationals, working, in, the, mines, in, the, state, of, veracruz, textile, workers, rioted, in, january, 1907, at, the, huge, r, o, blanco, factory, the, world, s, largest, protesting, against, unfair, labor, practices, they, were, paid, in, credit, that, could, be, used, only, at, the, company, store, binding, them, to, the, company, these, strikes, were, ruthlessly, suppressed, with, factory, owners, receiving, support, from, government, forces, in, the, cananea, strike, mine, owner, william, cornell, greene, received, support, from, d, az, s, rurales, in, sonora, as, well, as, arizona, rangers, called, in, from, across, the, u, s, border, this, arizona, rangers, were, ordered, to, use, violence, to, combat, labor, unrest, in, the, state, of, veracruz, the, mexican, army, gunned, down, rio, blanco, textile, workers, and, put, the, bodies, on, train, cars, that, transported, them, to, veracruz, where, the, bodies, were, dumped, in, the, harbor, as, food, for, sharks, since, the, press, was, censored, in, mexico, under, d, az, little, was, published, that, was, critical, of, the, regime, newspapers, barely, reported, on, the, rio, blanco, textile, strike, the, cananea, strike, or, harsh, labor, practices, on, plantations, in, oaxaca, and, yucat, n, leftist, mexican, opponents, of, the, d, az, regime, such, as, ricardo, flores, mag, n, and, pr, xedis, guerrero, went, into, exile, in, the, relative, safety, of, the, united, states, but, cooperation, between, the, u, s, government, and, d, az, s, agents, resulted, in, the, arrest, of, some, radicals, d, az, had, ruled, continuously, since, 1884, the, question, of, presidential, succession, was, an, issue, as, early, as, 1900, when, he, turned, 70, d, az, re, established, the, office, of, vice, president, in, 1906, choosing, ram, n, corral, rather, than, managing, political, succession, d, az, marginalized, corral, keeping, him, away, from, decision, making, d, az, publicly, announced, in, an, interview, with, journalist, james, creelman, for, pearson, s, magazine, that, he, would, not, run, in, the, 1910, election, at, age, 80, this, set, the, scene, for, a, possible, peaceful, transition, in, the, presidency, it, set, off, a, flurry, of, political, activity, to, the, dismay, of, potential, candidates, to, replace, him, he, reversed, himself, and, ran, again, his, later, reversal, on, retiring, from, the, presidency, set, off, tremendous, activity, among, opposition, groups, d, az, seems, to, have, initially, considered, finance, minister, jos, yves, limantour, as, his, successor, limantour, was, a, key, member, of, the, cient, ficos, the, circle, of, technocratic, advisers, steeped, in, positivist, political, science, another, potential, successor, was, general, bernardo, reyes, d, az, s, minister, of, war, who, also, served, as, governor, of, nuevo, le, n, reyes, an, opponent, of, the, cient, ficos, was, a, moderate, reformer, with, a, considerable, base, of, support, d, az, became, concerned, about, him, as, a, rival, and, forced, him, to, resign, from, his, cabinet, he, attempted, to, marginalize, reyes, by, sending, him, on, a, military, mission, to, europe, distancing, him, from, mexico, and, potential, political, supporters, the, potential, challenge, from, reyes, would, remain, one, of, d, az, s, political, obsessions, through, the, rest, of, the, decade, which, ultimately, blinded, him, to, the, danger, of, the, challenge, of, francisco, madero, s, anti, re, electionist, campaign, in, 1910, francisco, i, madero, a, young, man, from, a, wealthy, landowning, family, in, the, northern, state, of, coahuila, announced, his, intent, to, challenge, d, az, for, the, presidency, in, the, next, election, under, the, banner, of, the, anti, reelectionist, party, madero, chose, as, his, running, mate, francisco, v, zquez, g, mez, a, physician, who, had, opposed, d, az, madero, campaigned, vigorously, and, effectively, to, ensure, madero, did, not, win, d, az, had, him, jailed, before, the, election, he, escaped, and, fled, for, a, short, period, to, san, antonio, texas, d, az, was, announced, the, winner, of, the, election, by, a, landslide, on, 5, october, 1910, madero, issued, a, letter, from, jail, known, as, the, plan, de, san, luis, potos, with, its, main, slogan, sufragio, efectivo, no, re, elecci, n, effective, voting, no, re, election, it, declared, the, d, az, presidency, illegal, and, called, for, a, revolt, against, him, starting, on, 20, november, 1910, madero, s, political, plan, did, not, outline, a, major, socioeconomic, revolution, but, offered, hopes, of, change, for, many, disadvantaged, mexicans, the, plan, was, very, strongly, opposed, to, militarism, in, mexico, as, it, was, constituted, under, d, az, calling, on, federal, army, generals, to, resign, before, true, democracy, could, prevail, in, mexico, madero, realized, he, needed, a, revolutionary, armed, force, enticing, men, to, join, with, the, promise, of, formal, rank, and, encouraged, federales, to, join, the, revolutionary, forces, with, the, promise, of, promotion, madero, s, plan, was, aimed, at, fomenting, a, popular, uprising, against, d, az, but, he, also, understood, that, the, support, of, the, united, states, and, u, s, financiers, would, be, of, crucial, importance, in, undermining, the, regime, the, rich, and, powerful, madero, family, drew, on, its, resources, to, make, regime, change, possible, with, madero, s, brother, gustavo, a, madero, hiring, in, october, 1910, the, firm, of, washington, lawyer, sherburne, hopkins, the, world, s, best, rigger, of, latin, american, revolutions, to, encourage, support, in, the, u, s, a, strategy, to, discredit, d, az, with, u, s, business, and, the, u, s, government, achieved, some, success, with, standard, oil, representatives, engaging, in, talks, with, gustavo, madero, more, importantly, the, u, s, government, bent, neutrality, laws, for, the, revolutionaries, in, late, 1910, revolutionary, movements, arose, in, response, to, madero, s, plan, de, san, luis, potos, but, their, ultimate, success, was, the, result, of, the, federal, army, s, weakness, and, inability, to, suppress, them, madero, s, vague, promises, of, land, reform, attracted, many, peasants, throughout, the, country, spontaneous, rebellions, arose, in, which, ordinary, farm, laborers, miners, and, other, working, class, mexicans, along, with, much, of, the, country, s, population, of, indigenous, peoples, fought, d, az, s, forces, with, some, success, madero, attracted, the, forces, of, rebel, leaders, such, as, pascual, orozco, pancho, villa, emiliano, zapata, and, venustiano, carranza, a, young, and, able, revolutionary, orozco, along, with, chihuahua, governor, abraham, gonz, lez, formed, a, powerful, military, union, in, the, north, and, although, they, were, not, especially, committed, to, madero, took, mexicali, and, chihuahua, city, these, victories, encouraged, alliances, with, other, revolutionary, leaders, including, villa, against, madero, s, wishes, orozco, and, villa, fought, for, and, won, ciudad, ju, rez, bordering, el, paso, texas, on, the, south, side, of, the, rio, grande, madero, s, call, to, action, had, some, unanticipated, results, such, as, the, magonista, rebellion, of, 1911, in, baja, california, with, the, federal, army, defeated, in, a, string, of, battles, with, irregular, voluntary, forces, d, az, s, government, began, negotiations, with, the, revolutionaries, in, the, north, in, historian, edwin, lieuwen, s, assessment, victors, always, attribute, their, success, to, their, own, heroic, deeds, and, superior, fighting, abilities, what, happened, in, the, spring, of, 1911, was, that, armed, bands, under, self, appointed, chiefs, arose, all, over, the, republic, drove, d, az, officials, from, the, vicinity, seized, money, and, stamps, and, staked, out, spheres, of, local, authority, towns, and, cities, as, well, as, the, countryside, passed, into, the, hands, of, the, maderistas, d, az, sued, for, peace, with, madero, who, himself, did, not, want, a, prolonged, and, bloody, conflict, the, result, was, the, treaty, of, ciudad, ju, rez, signed, on, 21, may, 1911, the, signed, treaty, stated, that, d, az, would, abdicate, the, presidency, along, with, his, vice, president, ram, n, corral, by, the, end, of, may, 1911, to, be, replaced, by, an, interim, president, francisco, le, n, de, la, barra, until, elections, were, held, d, az, and, his, family, and, a, number, of, top, supporters, were, allowed, to, go, into, exile, when, d, az, left, for, exile, in, paris, he, was, reported, as, saying, madero, has, unleashed, a, tiger, let, us, see, if, he, can, control, it, with, d, az, in, exile, and, new, elections, to, be, called, in, october, the, power, structure, of, the, old, regime, remained, firmly, in, place, francisco, le, n, de, la, barra, became, interim, president, pending, an, election, to, be, held, in, october, 1911, madero, considered, de, la, barra, an, acceptable, figure, for, the, interim, presidency, since, he, was, not, a, cient, fico, or, politician, but, rather, a, catholic, lawyer, and, diplomat, he, appeared, to, be, a, moderate, but, the, german, ambassador, to, mexico, paul, von, hintze, who, associated, with, the, interim, president, said, of, him, that, de, la, barra, wants, to, accommodate, himself, with, dignity, to, the, inevitable, advance, of, the, ex, revolutionary, influence, while, accelerating, the, widespread, collapse, of, the, madero, party, the, federal, army, despite, its, numerous, defeats, by, the, revolutionaries, remained, intact, as, the, government, s, force, madero, called, on, revolutionary, fighters, to, lay, down, their, arms, and, demobilize, which, emiliano, zapata, and, the, revolutionaries, in, morelos, refused, to, do, the, cabinet, of, de, la, barra, and, the, mexican, congress, was, filled, with, supporters, of, the, d, az, regime, madero, campaigned, vigorously, for, the, presidency, during, this, interim, period, but, revolutionaries, who, had, supported, him, and, brought, about, d, az, s, resignation, were, dismayed, that, the, sweeping, reforms, they, sought, were, not, immediately, instituted, he, did, introduce, some, progressive, reforms, including, improved, funding, for, rural, schools, promoting, some, aspects, of, agrarian, reform, to, increase, the, amount, of, productive, land, labor, reforms, including, workman, s, compensation, and, the, eight, hour, day, but, also, defended, the, right, of, the, government, to, intervene, in, strikes, according, to, historian, peter, v, n, henderson, de, la, barra, s, and, congress, s, actions, suggests, that, few, porfirians, wished, to, return, to, the, status, quo, of, the, dictatorship, rather, the, thoughtful, progressive, members, of, the, porfirian, meritocracy, recognized, the, need, for, change, de, la, barra, s, government, sent, general, victoriano, huerta, to, fight, in, morelos, against, the, zapatistas, burning, villages, and, wreaking, havoc, his, actions, drove, a, wedge, between, zapata, and, madero, which, widened, when, madero, was, inaugurated, as, president, zapata, remained, in, arms, continuously, until, his, assassination, in, 1919, madero, won, the, 1911, election, decisively, and, was, inaugurated, as, president, in, november, 1911, but, his, movement, had, lost, crucial, momentum, and, revolutionary, supporters, in, the, months, of, the, interim, presidency, and, left, in, place, the, federal, army, madero, had, drawn, some, loyal, and, militarily, adept, supporters, who, brought, down, the, d, az, regime, by, force, of, arms, madero, himself, was, not, a, natural, soldier, and, his, decision, to, dismiss, the, revolutionary, forces, that, brought, him, to, power, isolated, him, politically, he, was, an, inexperienced, politician, who, had, never, held, office, before, he, firmly, held, to, democratic, ideals, which, many, consider, evidence, of, naivete, his, election, as, president, in, october, 1911, raised, high, expectations, among, many, mexicans, for, positive, change, the, treaty, of, ciudad, ju, rez, guaranteed, that, the, essential, structure, of, the, d, az, regime, including, the, federal, army, was, kept, in, place, madero, fervently, held, to, his, position, that, mexico, needed, real, democracy, which, included, regime, change, by, free, elections, a, free, press, and, the, right, of, labor, to, organize, and, strike, the, rebels, who, brought, him, to, power, were, demobilized, and, madero, called, on, these, men, of, action, to, return, to, civilian, life, according, to, a, story, told, by, pancho, villa, a, leader, who, had, defeated, d, az, s, army, and, forced, his, resignation, and, exile, he, told, madero, at, a, banquet, in, ciudad, ju, rez, in, 1911, you, sir, have, destroyed, the, revolution, it, s, simple, this, bunch, of, dandies, have, made, a, fool, of, you, and, this, will, eventually, cost, us, our, necks, yours, included, ignoring, the, warning, madero, increasingly, relied, on, the, federal, army, as, armed, rebellions, broke, out, in, mexico, in, 1911, 12, with, particularly, threatening, insurrections, led, by, emiliano, zapata, in, morelos, and, pascual, orozco, in, the, north, both, zapata, and, orozco, had, led, revolts, that, had, put, pressure, on, d, az, to, resign, and, both, felt, betrayed, by, madero, once, he, became, president, the, press, embraced, its, newfound, freedom, and, madero, became, a, target, of, its, criticism, organized, labor, which, had, been, suppressed, under, d, az, could, and, did, stage, strikes, which, foreign, entrepreneurs, saw, as, threatening, their, interests, although, there, had, been, labor, unrest, under, d, az, labor, s, new, freedom, to, organize, also, came, with, anti, american, currents, the, anarcho, syndicalist, casa, del, obrero, mundial, house, of, the, world, worker, was, founded, in, september, 1912, by, antonio, d, az, soto, y, gama, manuel, sarabia, and, l, zaro, guti, rrez, de, lara, and, served, as, a, center, of, agitation, and, propaganda, but, it, was, not, a, formal, labor, union, political, parties, proliferated, one, of, the, most, important, was, the, national, catholic, party, which, in, several, regions, of, the, country, was, particularly, strong, several, catholic, newspapers, were, in, circulation, during, the, madero, era, including, el, pa, s, and, la, naci, n, only, to, be, later, suppressed, under, the, victoriano, huerta, regime, 1913, 1914, under, d, az, relations, between, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, mexican, government, were, stable, with, the, anticlerical, laws, of, the, mexican, constitution, of, 1857, remaining, in, place, but, not, enforced, so, conflict, was, muted, during, madero, s, presidency, church, state, conflict, was, channeled, peacefully, the, national, catholic, party, became, an, important, political, opposition, force, during, the, madero, presidency, in, the, june, 1912, congressional, elections, militarily, quiescent, states, the, catholic, party, pcn, did, conspicuously, well, during, that, period, the, catholic, association, of, mexican, youth, acjm, was, founded, although, the, national, catholic, party, was, an, opposition, party, to, the, madero, regime, madero, clearly, welcomed, the, emergence, of, a, kind, of, two, party, system, catholic, and, liberal, he, encouraged, catholic, political, involvement, echoing, the, exhortations, of, the, episcopate, what, was, emerging, during, the, madero, regime, was, d, az, s, old, policy, of, church, state, detente, was, being, continued, perhaps, more, rapidly, and, on, surer, foundations, the, catholic, church, in, mexico, was, working, within, the, new, democratic, system, promoted, by, madero, but, it, had, its, interests, to, promote, some, of, which, were, the, forces, of, the, old, conservative, church, while, the, new, progressive, church, supporting, social, catholicism, of, the, 1891, papal, encyclical, rerum, novarum, was, also, a, current, when, madero, was, overthrown, in, february, 1913, by, counter, revolutionaries, the, conservative, wing, of, the, church, supported, the, coup, madero, did, not, have, the, experience, or, the, ideological, inclination, to, reward, men, who, had, helped, bring, him, to, power, some, revolutionary, leaders, expected, personal, rewards, such, as, pascual, orozco, of, chihuahua, others, wanted, major, reforms, most, especially, emiliano, zapata, and, andr, s, molina, enr, quez, who, had, long, worked, for, land, reform, madero, met, personally, with, zapata, telling, the, guerrilla, leader, that, the, agrarian, question, needed, careful, study, his, meaning, was, clear, madero, a, member, of, a, rich, northern, hacendado, family, was, not, about, to, implement, comprehensive, agrarian, reform, for, aggrieved, peasants, in, response, to, this, lack, of, action, zapata, promulgated, the, plan, de, ayala, in, november, 1911, declaring, himself, in, rebellion, against, madero, he, renewed, guerrilla, warfare, in, the, state, of, morelos, madero, sent, the, federal, army, to, deal, with, zapata, unsuccessfully, zapata, remained, true, to, the, demands, of, the, plan, de, ayala, and, in, rebellion, against, every, central, government, up, until, his, assassination, by, an, agent, of, president, venustiano, carranza, in, 1919, the, northern, revolutionary, general, pascual, orozco, a, leader, in, taking, ciudad, ju, rez, had, expected, to, become, governor, of, chihuahua, in, 1911, although, orozco, was, the, man, of, the, hour, madero, gave, the, governorship, instead, to, abraham, gonz, lez, a, respectable, revolutionary, with, the, explanation, that, orozco, had, not, reached, the, legal, age, to, serve, as, governor, a, tactic, that, was, a, useful, constitutional, alibi, for, thwarting, the, ambitions, of, young, popular, revolutionary, leaders, madero, had, put, orozco, in, charge, of, the, large, force, of, rurales, in, chihuahua, but, to, a, gifted, revolutionary, fighter, who, had, helped, bring, about, d, az, s, fall, madero, s, reward, was, insulting, after, madero, refused, to, agree, to, social, reforms, calling, for, better, working, hours, pay, and, conditions, orozco, organized, his, army, the, orozquistas, also, called, the, colorados, red, flaggers, and, issued, his, plan, orozquista, on, 25, march, 1912, enumerating, why, he, was, rising, in, revolt, against, madero, in, april, 1912, madero, dispatched, general, victoriano, huerta, of, the, federal, army, to, put, down, orozco, s, dangerous, revolt, madero, had, kept, the, army, intact, as, an, institution, using, it, to, put, down, domestic, rebellions, against, his, regime, huerta, was, a, professional, soldier, and, continued, to, serve, in, the, army, under, the, new, commander, in, chief, huerta, s, loyalty, lay, with, general, bernardo, reyes, rather, than, with, the, civilian, madero, in, 1912, under, pressure, from, his, cabinet, madero, called, on, huerta, to, suppress, orozco, s, rebellion, with, huerta, s, success, against, orozco, he, emerged, as, a, powerful, figure, for, conservative, forces, opposing, the, madero, regime, during, the, orozco, revolt, the, governor, of, chihuahua, mobilized, the, state, militia, to, support, the, federal, army, pancho, villa, now, a, colonel, in, the, militia, was, called, up, at, this, time, in, mid, april, at, the, head, of, 400, irregular, troops, he, joined, the, forces, commanded, by, huerta, huerta, however, viewed, villa, as, an, ambitious, competitor, during, a, visit, to, huerta, s, headquarters, in, june, 1912, after, an, incident, in, which, he, refused, to, return, a, number, of, stolen, horses, villa, was, imprisoned, on, charges, of, insubordination, and, robbery, and, sentenced, to, death, ra, l, madero, the, president, s, brother, intervened, to, save, villa, s, life, jailed, in, mexico, city, villa, escaped, and, fled, to, the, united, states, later, to, return, and, play, a, major, role, in, the, civil, wars, of, 1913, 1915, there, were, other, rebellions, one, led, by, bernardo, reyes, and, another, by, f, lix, d, az, nephew, of, the, former, president, that, were, quickly, put, down, and, the, generals, jailed, they, were, both, in, mexico, city, prisons, and, despite, their, geographical, separation, they, were, able, to, foment, yet, another, rebellion, in, february, 1913, this, period, came, to, be, known, as, the, ten, tragic, days, la, decena, tr, gica, which, ended, with, madero, s, resignation, and, assassination, and, huerta, assuming, the, presidency, although, madero, had, reason, to, distrust, victoriano, huerta, madero, placed, him, in, charge, of, suppressing, the, mexico, city, revolt, as, interim, commander, he, did, not, know, that, huerta, had, been, invited, to, join, the, conspiracy, but, had, initially, held, back, during, the, fighting, that, took, place, in, the, capital, the, civilian, population, was, subjected, to, artillery, exchanges, street, fighting, and, economic, disruption, perhaps, deliberately, caused, by, the, coupists, to, demonstrate, that, madero, was, unable, to, keep, order, the, madero, presidency, was, unravelling, to, no, one, s, surprise, except, perhaps, madero, s, whose, support, continued, to, deteriorate, even, among, his, political, allies, madero, s, supporters, in, congress, before, the, coup, the, so, called, renovadores, the, renewers, criticized, him, saying, the, revolution, is, heading, toward, collapse, and, is, pulling, the, government, to, which, it, gave, rise, down, with, it, for, the, simple, reason, that, it, is, not, governing, with, revolutionaries, compromises, and, concessions, to, the, supporters, of, the, old, regime, are, the, main, causes, of, the, unsettling, situation, in, which, the, government, that, emerged, from, the, revolution, finds, itself, the, regime, appears, relentlessly, bent, on, suicide, huerta, formally, in, charge, of, the, defense, of, madero, s, regime, allowed, the, rebels, to, hold, the, armory, in, mexico, city, the, ciudadela, while, he, consolidated, his, political, power, he, changed, allegiance, from, madero, to, the, rebels, under, f, lix, d, az, bernardo, reyes, having, been, killed, on, the, first, day, of, the, open, armed, conflict, u, s, ambassador, henry, lane, wilson, who, had, done, all, he, could, to, undermine, u, s, confidence, in, madero, s, presidency, brokered, the, pact, of, the, embassy, which, formalized, the, alliance, between, f, lix, d, az, and, huerta, with, the, backing, of, the, united, states, huerta, was, to, become, provisional, president, following, the, resignations, of, madero, and, his, vice, president, jos, mar, a, pino, su, rez, rather, than, being, sent, into, exile, with, their, families, the, two, were, murdered, while, being, transported, to, prison, a, shocking, event, but, one, that, did, not, prevent, the, huerta, regime, s, recognition, by, most, world, governments, with, the, notable, exception, of, the, u, s, historian, friedrich, katz, considers, madero, s, retention, of, the, federal, army, which, was, defeated, by, the, revolutionary, forces, and, resulted, in, d, az, s, resignation, was, the, basic, cause, of, his, fall, his, failure, is, also, attributable, to, the, failure, of, the, social, class, to, which, he, belonged, and, whose, interests, he, considered, to, be, identical, to, those, of, mexico, the, liberal, hacendados, owners, of, large, estates, madero, had, created, no, political, organization, that, could, survive, his, death, and, had, alienated, and, demobilized, the, revolutionary, fighters, who, had, helped, bring, him, to, power, in, the, aftermath, of, his, assassination, and, huerta, s, seizure, of, power, via, a, military, coup, former, revolutionaries, had, no, formal, organization, through, which, to, raise, opposition, to, huerta, madero, s, martyrdom, accomplished, what, he, was, unable, to, do, while, alive, unite, all, the, revolutionists, under, one, banner, within, 16, months, revolutionary, armies, defeated, the, federal, army, and, the, huerta, regime, fell, like, porfirio, d, az, huerta, went, into, exile, the, federal, army, was, disbanded, leaving, only, revolutionary, military, forces, upon, taking, power, huerta, had, moved, swiftly, to, consolidate, his, hold, in, the, north, having, learned, the, lesson, from, d, az, s, fall, that, the, north, was, a, crucial, region, to, hold, within, a, month, of, the, coup, rebellions, began, to, spread, throughout, mexico, most, prominently, led, by, the, governor, of, the, state, of, coahuila, venustiano, carranza, along, with, pablo, gonz, lez, huerta, expected, state, governors, to, fall, into, line, with, the, new, government, but, carranza, and, abraham, gonz, lez, governor, of, chihuahua, did, not, carranza, issued, the, plan, of, guadalupe, a, strictly, political, plan, to, reject, the, legitimacy, of, the, huerta, government, and, called, on, revolutionaries, to, take, up, arms, revolutionaries, who, had, brought, madero, to, power, only, to, be, dismissed, in, favor, of, the, federal, army, eagerly, responded, to, the, call, most, prominently, pancho, villa, alvaro, obreg, n, of, sonora, a, successful, rancher, and, businessman, who, had, not, participated, in, the, madero, revolution, now, joined, the, revolutionary, forces, in, the, north, the, constitutionalist, army, under, the, primer, jefe, first, chief, venustiano, carranza, huerta, had, governor, gonz, lez, arrested, and, murdered, for, fear, he, would, foment, rebellion, when, northern, general, pancho, villa, became, governor, of, chihuahua, in, 1914, following, the, defeat, of, huerta, he, located, gonz, lez, s, bones, and, had, them, reburied, with, full, honors, in, morelos, emiliano, zapata, continued, his, rebellion, under, the, plan, of, ayala, while, expunging, the, name, of, counter, revolutionary, pascual, orozco, from, it, calling, for, the, expropriation, of, land, and, redistribution, to, peasants, huerta, offered, peace, to, zapata, who, rejected, it, the, huerta, government, was, thus, challenged, by, revolutionary, forces, in, the, north, of, mexico, and, the, strategic, state, of, morelos, just, south, of, the, capital, huerta, s, presidency, is, usually, characterized, as, a, dictatorship, from, the, point, of, view, of, revolutionaries, at, the, time, and, the, construction, of, historical, memory, of, the, revolution, it, is, without, any, positive, aspects, despite, recent, attempts, to, portray, victoriano, huerta, as, a, reformer, there, is, little, question, that, he, was, a, self, serving, dictator, there, are, few, biographies, of, huerta, but, one, strongly, asserts, that, huerta, should, not, be, labeled, simply, as, a, counter, revolutionary, arguing, that, his, regime, consisted, of, two, distinct, periods, from, the, coup, in, february, 1913, up, to, october, 1913, during, that, time, he, attempted, to, legitimize, his, regime, and, demonstrate, its, legality, by, pursuing, reformist, policies, and, after, october, 1913, when, he, dropped, all, attempts, to, rule, within, a, legal, framework, and, began, murdering, political, opponents, while, battling, revolutionary, forces, that, had, united, in, opposition, to, his, regime, supporting, the, huerta, regime, initially, were, business, interests, in, mexico, both, foreign, and, domestic, landed, elites, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, german, and, british, governments, the, u, s, president, woodrow, wilson, did, not, recognize, the, huerta, regime, since, it, had, come, to, power, by, coup, huerta, and, carranza, were, in, contact, for, two, weeks, immediately, after, the, february, coup, but, they, did, not, come, to, an, agreement, carranza, then, declared, himself, opposed, to, huerta, and, became, the, leader, of, the, anti, huerta, forces, in, the, north, huerta, gained, the, support, of, revolutionary, general, pascual, orozco, who, had, helped, topple, the, d, az, regime, then, rebelled, against, madero, because, of, his, lack, of, action, on, agrarian, issues, huerta, s, first, cabinet, comprised, men, who, had, supported, the, february, 1913, pact, of, the, embassy, among, them, some, who, had, supported, madero, such, as, jes, s, flores, mag, n, supporters, of, general, bernardo, reyes, supporters, of, f, lix, d, az, and, former, interim, president, francisco, le, n, de, la, barra, during, the, counter, revolutionary, regime, of, huerta, the, catholic, church, in, mexico, initially, supported, him, the, church, represented, a, force, for, reaction, especially, in, the, countryside, however, when, huerta, cracked, down, on, political, parties, and, conservative, opposition, he, had, gabriel, somellera, president, of, the, catholic, party, arrested, la, naci, n, which, like, other, catholic, papers, had, protested, congress, s, dissolution, and, the, rigged, elections, locked, horns, with, the, official, press, and, was, finally, closed, down, el, pa, s, the, main, catholic, newspaper, survived, for, a, time, huerta, was, even, able, to, briefly, muster, the, support, of, andr, s, molina, enr, quez, author, of, the, great, national, problems, los, grandes, problemas, nacionales, a, key, work, urging, land, reform, in, mexico, huerta, was, seemingly, deeply, concerned, with, the, issue, of, land, reform, since, it, was, a, persistent, spur, of, peasant, unrest, specifically, he, moved, to, restore, ejido, lands, to, the, yaquis, and, mayos, of, sonora, and, proposals, for, distribution, of, government, lands, to, small, scale, farmers, when, huerta, refused, to, move, faster, on, land, reform, molina, enr, quez, disavowed, the, regime, in, june, 1913, later, going, on, to, advise, the, 1917, constitutional, convention, on, land, reform, u, s, president, taft, left, the, decision, of, whether, to, recognize, the, new, government, up, to, the, incoming, president, woodrow, wilson, despite, the, urging, of, u, s, ambassador, henry, lane, wilson, who, had, played, a, key, role, in, the, coup, d, tat, president, wilson, not, only, declined, to, recognize, huerta, s, government, but, first, supplanted, the, ambassador, by, sending, his, personal, representative, john, lind, a, progressive, who, sympathized, with, the, mexican, revolutionaries, and, the, president, recalled, ambassador, wilson, the, united, states, lifted, the, arms, embargo, imposed, by, taft, in, order, to, supply, weapons, to, the, landlocked, rebels, while, under, the, complete, embargo, huerta, had, still, been, able, to, receive, shipments, from, the, british, by, sea, wilson, urged, european, powers, to, not, recognize, huerta, s, government, and, attempted, to, persuade, huerta, to, call, prompt, elections, and, not, present, himself, as, a, candidate, the, united, states, offered, mexico, a, loan, on, the, condition, that, huerta, accept, the, proposal, he, refused, lind, clearly, threatened, a, military, intervention, in, case, the, demands, were, not, met, in, the, summer, of, 1913, mexican, conservatives, who, had, supported, huerta, sought, a, constitutionally, elected, civilian, alternative, to, huerta, brought, together, in, a, body, called, the, national, unifying, junta, political, parties, proliferated, in, this, period, a, sign, that, democracy, had, taken, hold, and, there, were, 26, by, the, time, of, the, october, congressional, elections, from, huerta, s, point, of, view, the, fragmentation, of, the, conservative, political, landscape, strengthened, his, own, position, for, the, country, s, conservative, elite, there, was, a, growing, disillusionment, with, huerta, and, disgust, at, his, strong, arm, methods, huerta, closed, the, legislature, on, 26, october, 1913, having, the, army, surround, its, building, and, arresting, congressmen, perceived, to, be, hostile, to, his, regime, despite, that, congressional, elections, went, ahead, but, given, that, congress, was, dissolved, and, some, members, were, in, jail, opposition, candidates, fervor, disappeared, the, sham, election, brought, home, to, wilson, s, administration, the, fatuity, of, relying, on, elections, to, demonstrate, genuine, democracy, the, october, 1913, elections, were, the, end, of, any, pretension, to, constitutional, rule, in, mexico, with, civilian, political, activity, banned, prominent, catholics, were, arrested, and, catholic, newspapers, were, suppressed, huerta, militarized, mexico, to, a, greater, extent, than, it, already, was, when, huerta, seized, power, in, 1913, the, army, had, on, the, books, approximately, 50, 000, men, but, huerta, mandated, the, number, rise, to, 150, 000, then, 200, 000, and, finally, in, spring, 1914, 250, 000, raising, that, number, of, men, in, so, short, a, time, would, not, occur, with, volunteers, and, the, army, resorted, to, the, leva, forced, conscription, the, revolutionary, forces, had, no, problem, with, voluntary, recruitment, most, mexican, men, avoided, government, conscription, at, all, costs, and, the, ones, dragooned, into, the, forces, were, sent, to, areas, far, away, from, home, and, were, reluctant, to, fight, conscripts, deserted, mutinied, and, attacked, and, murdered, their, officers, in, april, 1914, u, s, opposition, to, huerta, culminated, in, the, seizure, and, occupation, of, the, port, of, veracruz, by, u, s,

iguala, taxco, and, buenavista, de, cuellar, he, confronted, the, federal, garrisons, in, morelos, the, majority, of, which, defected, to, him, with, their, weapons, finally, he, moved, against, the, capital, by, sending, his, subordinates, into, mexico, state, constitutionalist, forces, made, major, gains, against, the, federal, army, in, early, 1914, pancho, villa, had, moved, against, the,

hub, city, after, bitter, fighting, for, the, hills, surrounding, torre, n, and, later, point, blank, bombardment, on, april, 3, villa, s, troops, entered, the, devastated, city, the, federal, army, made, a, last, stand, at, san, pedro, de, las, colonias, only, to, be, undone, by, squabbling, between, the, two, commanding, officers, general, velasco, and, general, maas, over, who, had, the, higher, rank, as, of, mid, april, mexico, city, sat, undefended, before, constitutionalist, forces, under, villa, obreg, n, moved, south, from, sonora, along, the, pacific, coast, when, his, way, was, blocked, by, federal, gunboats, obreg, n, attacked, these, boats, with, an, airplane, an, early, use, of, an, airplane, for, military, purposes, in, early, july, he, defeated, federal, troops, at, orendain, jalisco, leaving, 8, 000, federals, dead, and, capturing, a, large, trove, of, armaments, he, was, now, in, a, position, to, arrive, at, mexico, city, ahead, of, villa, who, was, diverted, by, orders, from, carranza, to, take, saltillo, carranza, the, civilian, first, chief, carranza, and, villa, the, bold, and, successful, commander, of, the, division, of, the, north, were, on, the, verge, of, splitting, obreg, n, the, other, highly, successful, constitutionalist, general, sought, to, keep, the, northern, coalition, intact, the, federal, army, s, defeats, caused, huerta, s, position, to, continue, to, deteriorate, and, in, mid, july, 1914, he, stepped, down, and, fled, to, the, gulf, coast, port, of, puerto, m, xico, seeking, to, get, himself, and, his, family, out, of, mexico, rather, than, face, the, fate, of, madero, he, turned, to, the, german, government, which, had, generally, supported, his, presidency, the, germans, were, not, eager, to, allow, him, to, be, transported, into, exile, on, one, of, their, ships, but, relented, huerta, carried, roughly, half, a, million, marks, in, gold, with, him, as, well, as, paper, currency, and, checks, in, exile, huerta, sought, to, return, to, mexico, via, the, united, states, u, s, authorities, arrested, him, and, he, was, imprisoned, in, fort, bliss, texas, he, died, in, january, 1916, six, months, after, going, into, exile, huerta, s, resignation, marked, the, end, of, an, era, the, federal, army, a, spectacularly, ineffective, fighting, force, against, the, revolutionaries, ceased, to, exist, the, revolutionary, factions, that, had, united, in, opposition, to, huerta, s, regime, now, faced, a, new, political, landscape, with, the, counter, revolutionaries, decisively, defeated, the, revolutionary, armies, now, contended, for, power, and, a, new, era, of, civil, war, began, after, an, attempt, at, an, agreement, among, the, winners, at, a, convention, of, aguascalientes, with, huerta, s, ouster, in, july, 1914, and, the, dissolution, of, the, federal, army, in, august, the, revolutionary, factions, agreed, to, meet, and, make, a, last, ditch, effort, to, avert, more, intense, warfare, than, that, which, unseated, huerta, commander, of, the, division, of, the, north, pancho, villa, and, the, division, of, the, northeast, pablo, gonz, lez, had, drawn, up, the, pact, of, torre, n, in, early, july, pushing, for, a, more, radical, agenda, than, carranza, s, plan, of, guadalupe, it, also, called, for, a, meeting, of, revolutionary, generals, to, decide, mexico, s, political, future, carranza, called, for, a, meeting, in, october, 1914, mexico, city, which, he, now, controlled, with, obreg, n, but, other, revolutionaries, opposed, to, carranza, s, influence, successfully, moved, the, venue, to, aguascalientes, the, convention, of, aguascalientes, did, not, in, fact, reconcile, the, various, victorious, factions, in, the, mexican, revolution, the, break, between, carranza, and, villa, became, definitive, during, the, convention, carranza, spurned, it, and, villa, effectively, hijacked, it, mexico, s, lesser, caudillos, were, forced, to, choose, between, those, two, forces, it, was, a, brief, pause, in, revolutionary, violence, before, another, all, out, period, of, civil, war, ensued, carranza, had, expected, to, be, confirmed, in, his, position, as, first, chief, of, revolutionary, forces, but, his, supporters, lost, control, of, the, proceedings, opposition, to, carranza, was, strongest, in, areas, where, there, were, popular, and, fierce, demands, for, reform, particularly, in, chihuahua, where, villa, was, powerful, and, in, morelos, where, zapata, held, sway, the, convention, of, aguascalientes, brought, that, opposition, out, in, an, open, forum, the, revolutionary, generals, of, the, convention, called, on, carranza, to, resign, executive, power, although, he, agreed, to, do, so, he, laid, out, conditions, for, it, he, would, resign, if, both, pancho, villa, and, emiliano, zapata, his, main, rivals, for, power, would, resign, and, go, into, exile, and, that, there, should, be, a, so, called, pre, constitutionalist, government, that, would, take, charge, of, carrying, out, the, social, and, political, reforms, the, country, needs, before, a, fully, constitutional, government, is, re, established, rather, than, first, chief, carranza, being, named, president, of, mexico, at, the, convention, general, eulalio, guti, rrez, was, chosen, for, a, term, of, 20, days, the, convention, declared, carranza, in, rebellion, against, it, civil, war, resumed, this, time, between, revolutionary, armies, that, had, fought, in, a, united, cause, to, oust, huerta, in, 1913, 1914, during, the, convention, constitutionalist, general, lvaro, obreg, n, had, attempted, to, be, a, moderating, force, and, had, been, the, one, to, convey, the, convention, s, call, for, carranza, to, resign, the, lines, were, now, drawn, when, the, convention, forces, declared, carranza, in, rebellion, against, it, obreg, n, supported, carranza, rather, than, villa, and, zapata, villa, and, zapata, went, into, a, loose, alliance, their, forces, moved, separately, on, mexico, city, and, took, it, when, carranza, s, forces, evacuated, it, in, december, 1914, for, veracruz, the, famous, picture, of, zapata, and, villa, in, the, national, palace, with, villa, sitting, in, the, presidential, chair, is, a, classic, image, of, the, revolution, villa, is, reported, to, have, said, to, zapata, that, the, presidential, chair, is, too, big, for, us, in, practice, the, alliance, between, villa, and, zapata, as, the, army, of, the, convention, did, not, function, beyond, this, initial, victory, against, the, constitutionalists, villa, and, zapata, left, the, capital, with, zapata, returning, to, his, southern, stronghold, in, morelos, where, he, continued, to, engage, in, warfare, under, the, plan, of, ayala, lacking, a, firm, center, of, power, and, leadership, the, convention, government, was, plagued, by, instability, villa, was, the, real, power, emerging, from, the, convention, and, he, prepared, to, strengthen, his, position, by, winning, a, decisive, victory, against, the, constitutionalist, army, villa, had, a, well, earned, reputation, as, a, fierce, and, successful, general, and, the, combination, of, forces, arrayed, against, carranza, by, villa, other, northern, generals, and, zapata, was, larger, than, the, constitutionalist, army, so, it, was, not, at, all, clear, that, carranza, s, faction, would, prevail, he, did, have, the, advantage, of, the, loyalty, of, general, lvaro, obreg, n, despite, obreg, n, s, moderating, actions, at, the, convention, of, aguascalientes, even, trying, to, persuade, carranza, to, resign, his, position, he, ultimately, sided, with, carranza, another, advantage, of, carranza, s, position, was, the, constitutionalists, control, of, veracruz, even, though, the, united, states, still, occupied, it, the, united, states, had, concluded, that, both, villa, and, zapata, were, too, radical, and, hostile, to, its, interests, and, sided, with, the, moderate, carranza, in, the, factional, fighting, the, u, s, timed, its, exit, from, veracruz, brokered, at, the, niagara, falls, peace, conference, to, benefit, carranza, and, allowed, munitions, to, flow, to, the, constitutionalists, the, u, s, granted, carranza, s, government, diplomatic, recognition, in, october, 1915, the, rival, armies, of, villa, and, obreg, n, clashed, in, april, 1915, in, the, battle, of, celaya, which, lasted, from, the, sixth, to, the, 15th, the, frontal, cavalry, charges, of, villa, s, forces, were, met, by, the, shrewd, modern, military, tactics, of, obreg, n, the, victory, of, the, constitutionalists, was, complete, and, carranza, emerged, as, the, political, leader, of, mexico, with, a, victorious, army, to, keep, him, in, that, position, villa, retreated, north, carranza, and, the, constitutionalists, consolidated, their, position, as, the, winning, faction, with, zapata, remaining, a, threat, until, his, assassination, in, 1919, villa, also, remained, a, threat, to, the, constitutionalists, complicating, their, relationship, with, the, united, states, when, elements, of, villa, s, forces, raided, columbus, new, mexico, in, march, 1916, prompting, the, u, s, to, launch, a, punitive, expedition, into, mexico, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, capture, him, carranza, s, 1913, plan, of, guadalupe, was, narrowly, political, designed, to, unite, the, anti, huerta, forces, in, the, north, but, once, huerta, was, ousted, the, federal, army, dissolved, and, former, constitutionalist, pancho, villa, defeated, carranza, sought, to, consolidate, his, position, the, constitutionalists, retook, mexico, city, which, had, been, held, by, the, zapatistas, and, held, it, permanently, he, did, not, take, the, title, of, provisional, or, interim, president, of, mexico, since, in, doing, so, he, would, have, been, ineligible, to, become, the, constitutional, president, until, the, promulgation, of, the, 1917, constitution, was, framed, as, the, preconstitutional, government, in, october, 1915, the, u, s, recognized, carranza, s, government, as, the, de, facto, ruling, power, following, obreg, n, s, victories, this, gave, carranza, s, constitutionalists, legitimacy, internationally, and, access, to, the, legal, flow, of, arms, from, the, u, s, the, carranza, government, still, had, active, opponents, including, villa, who, retreated, north, zapata, remained, active, in, the, south, even, though, he, was, losing, support, zapata, remained, a, threat, to, the, carranza, regime, until, his, assassination, by, order, of, carranza, on, 10, april, 1919, disorder, and, violence, in, the, countryside, was, largely, due, to, anti, carranza, forces, but, banditry, as, well, as, military, and, police, misconduct, contributed, to, the, unsettled, situation, the, government, s, inability, to, keep, order, gave, an, opening, to, supporters, of, the, old, order, headed, by, f, lix, d, az, some, 36, generals, of, the, dissolved, federal, army, stood, with, d, az, the, constitutionalist, army, was, renamed, the, mexican, national, army, and, carranza, sent, some, of, its, most, able, generals, to, eliminate, threats, in, morelos, he, sent, general, pablo, gonz, lez, to, fight, zapata, s, liberating, army, of, the, south, morelos, was, very, close, to, mexico, city, so, zapata, s, control, of, it, and, parts, of, the, adjacent, state, of, puebla, made, carranza, s, government, vulnerable, constitutionalist, army, soldiers, assassinated, zapata, in, an, ambush, in, 1919, after, their, commanding, officer, tricked, zapata, by, pretending, that, he, intended, to, defect, to, zapata, s, side, carranza, sent, general, francisco, murgu, a, and, general, manuel, m, di, guez, to, track, down, and, eliminate, villa, but, they, were, unsuccessful, they, did, capture, and, execute, one, of, villa, s, top, men, general, felipe, angeles, the, only, general, of, the, old, federal, army, to, join, the, revolutionaries, revolutionary, generals, asserted, their, right, to, rule, having, been, victorious, in, the, revolution, but, they, ruled, in, a, manner, which, was, a, credit, neither, to, themselves, their, institution, nor, the, carranza, government, more, often, than, not, they, were, predatory, venal, cruel, and, corrupt, the, system, of, central, government, control, over, states, that, d, az, had, created, over, decades, had, broken, down, during, the, revolutionary, fighting, autonomous, fiefdoms, arose, in, which, governors, simply, ignored, orders, by, the, carranza, government, one, of, these, was, governor, of, sonora, general, plutarco, el, as, calles, who, later, joined, in, the, 1920, successful, coup, against, carranza, the, 1914, pact, of, torre, n, had, contained, far, more, radical, language, and, promises, of, land, reform, and, support, for, peasants, and, workers, than, carranza, s, original, plan, carranza, issued, the, additions, to, the, plan, of, guadalupe, which, for, the, first, time, promised, significant, reform, he, also, issued, an, agrarian, reform, law, in, 1915, drafted, by, luis, cabrera, sanctioning, the, return, of, all, village, lands, illegally, seized, in, contravention, of, an, 1856, law, passed, under, benito, ju, rez, the, carranza, reform, declared, village, lands, were, to, be, divided, among, individuals, aiming, at, creating, a, class, of, small, holders, and, not, to, revive, the, old, structure, of, communities, of, communal, landholders, in, practice, land, was, transferred, not, to, villagers, but, rather, redistributed, to, constitutional, army, generals, and, created, new, large, scale, enterprises, as, rewards, to, the, victorious, military, leaders, carranza, did, not, move, on, land, reform, despite, his, rhetoric, rather, he, returned, confiscated, estates, to, their, owners, not, only, did, he, oppose, large, scale, land, reform, he, vetoed, laws, that, would, have, increased, agricultural, production, by, giving, peasants, temporary, access, to, lands, not, under, cultivation, in, places, where, peasants, had, fought, for, land, reform, carranza, s, policy, was, to, repress, them, and, deny, their, demands, in, the, southeast, where, hacienda, owners, held, strong, carranza, sent, the, most, radical, of, his, supporters, francisco, m, gica, in, tabasco, and, salvador, alvarado, in, yucatan, to, mobilize, peasants, and, be, a, counterweight, to, the, hacienda, owners, after, taking, control, of, yucat, n, in, 1915, salvador, alvarado, organized, a, large, socialist, party, and, carried, out, extensive, land, reform, he, confiscated, the, large, landed, estates, and, redistributed, the, land, in, smaller, plots, to, the, liberated, peasants, maximo, castillo, a, revolutionary, brigadier, general, from, chihuahua, was, frustrated, by, the, slow, pace, of, land, reform, under, the, madero, presidency, he, ordered, the, subdivision, of, six, haciendas, belonging, to, luis, terrazas, which, were, given, to, sharecroppers, and, tenants, carranza, s, relationship, with, the, united, states, had, initially, benefited, from, its, recognition, of, his, government, with, the, constitutionalist, army, being, able, to, buy, arms, in, 1915, and, early, 1916, there, is, evidence, that, carranza, was, seeking, a, loan, from, the, u, s, with, the, backing, of, u, s, bankers, and, a, formal, alliance, with, the, u, s, mexican, nationalists, in, mexico, were, seeking, a, stronger, stance, against, the, colossus, of, the, north, by, taxing, foreign, holdings, and, limiting, their, influence, with, villa, s, raid, against, columbus, new, mexico, in, march, 1916, ended, the, possibility, of, a, closer, relationship, with, the, u, s, under, heavy, pressure, from, public, opinion, in, the, u, s, to, punish, the, attackers, stoked, mainly, by, the, papers, of, ultra, conservative, publisher, william, randolph, hearst, who, owned, a, large, estate, in, mexico, u, s, president, woodrow, wilson, sent, general, john, j, pershing, and, around, 5, 000, troops, into, mexico, in, an, attempt, to, capture, villa, the, u, s, army, intervention, known, as, the, punitive, expedition, was, limited, to, the, western, sierras, of, chihuahua, from, the, mexican, perspective, as, much, as, carranza, sought, the, elimination, of, his, rival, villa, but, as, a, mexican, nationalist, he, could, not, countenance, the, extended, u, s, incursion, into, its, sovereign, territory, villa, knew, the, inhospitable, terrain, intimately, and, operating, with, guerrilla, tactics, he, had, little, trouble, evading, his, u, s, army, pursuers, villa, was, deeply, entrenched, in, the, mountains, of, northern, mexico, and, knew, the, terrain, too, well, to, be, captured, u, s, general, john, j, pershing, could, not, continue, with, his, unsuccessful, mission, declaring, victory, the, troops, returned, to, the, u, s, after, nearly, a, year, they, were, shortly, thereafter, deployed, to, europe, when, the, u, s, entered, world, war, i, on, the, side, of, the, allies, the, punitive, mission, not, only, damaged, the, fragile, united, states, mexico, relationship, but, also, caused, a, rise, in, anti, american, sentiment, among, the, mexicans, carranza, asserted, mexican, sovereignty, and, forced, the, u, s, to, withdraw, in, 1917, with, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, europe, in, 1914, foreign, powers, with, significant, economic, and, strategic, interests, in, mexico, particularly, the, u, s, great, britain, and, germany, made, efforts, to, sway, mexico, to, their, side, but, mexico, maintained, a, policy, of, neutrality, in, the, zimmermann, telegram, a, coded, cable, from, the, german, government, to, carranza, s, government, germany, attempted, to, draw, mexico, into, war, with, the, united, states, which, was, itself, neutral, at, the, time, germany, hoped, to, draw, u, s, troops, from, deployment, to, europe, and, as, a, reward, in, the, event, of, a, german, victory, to, return, the, territory, lost, to, mexico, to, the, u, s, in, the, mexican, american, war, carranza, did, not, pursue, this, policy, but, the, leaking, of, the, telegram, pushed, the, u, s, into, war, against, germany, in, 1917, the, constitutionalist, army, fought, in, the, name, of, the, 1857, constitution, promulgated, by, liberals, during, the, reform, era, sparking, a, decade, long, armed, conflict, between, liberals, and, conservatives, in, contrast, the, 1917, constitution, came, at, the, culmination, of, revolutionary, struggle, drafting, a, new, constitution, was, not, a, given, at, the, outbreak, of, the, revolution, carranza, s, 1913, plan, of, guadalupe, was, a, narrow, political, plan, to, unite, mexicans, against, the, huerta, regime, and, named, carranza, as, the, head, of, the, constitutionalist, army, increasingly, revolutionaries, called, for, radical, reform, carranza, had, consolidated, power, and, his, advisers, persuaded, him, that, a, new, constitution, would, better, accomplish, incorporating, major, reforms, than, a, piecemeal, revision, of, the, 1857, constitution, in, 1916, carranza, was, only, acting, president, at, the, time, and, the, expectation, was, to, hold, presidential, elections, he, called, for, a, constituent, congress, to, draft, a, new, document, based, on, liberal, and, revolutionary, principles, labor, had, supported, the, constitutionalists, and, red, battalions, had, fought, against, the, zapatistas, the, peasant, revolutionaries, of, morelos, as, revolutionary, violence, subsided, in, 1916, leaders, of, the, constitutionalist, faction, met, in, quer, taro, to, revise, the, 1857, constitution, the, delegates, were, elected, by, jurisdiction, and, population, with, the, exclusion, of, those, who, served, the, huerta, regime, continued, to, follow, villa, after, the, split, with, carranza, as, well, as, zapatistas, the, election, of, delegates, was, to, frame, the, creation, of, the, new, constitution, as, the, result, of, popular, participation, carranza, provided, a, draft, revision, for, the, delegates, to, consider, once, the, convention, was, in, session, after, disputes, about, delegates, delegates, reviewed, carranza, s, draft, constitution, that, document, was, a, minor, revision, of, the, 1857, constitution, and, included, none, of, the, social, economic, and, political, demands, for, which, revolutionary, forces, fought, and, died, the, convention, was, divided, between, conservatives, mostly, politicians, who, had, supported, madero, and, then, carranza, and, progressives, who, were, soldiers, who, had, fought, in, revolutionary, battles, the, progressives, deemed, radical, jacobins, by, the, conservatives, sought, to, integrate, deep, political, and, social, reforms, into, the, political, structure, of, the, country, making, principles, for, which, many, of, the, revolutionaries, had, fought, into, law, the, mexican, constitution, of, 1917, was, strongly, nationalist, giving, the, government, the, power, to, expropriate, foreign, ownership, of, resources, and, enabling, land, reform, article, 27, it, also, had, a, strong, code, protecting, organized, labor, article, 123, and, extended, state, power, over, the, roman, catholic, church, in, mexico, in, its, role, in, education, article, 3, villistas, and, zapatistas, were, excluded, from, the, constituent, congress, but, their, political, challenge, pushed, the, delegates, to, radicalize, the, constitution, which, in, turn, was, far, more, radical, than, carranza, himself, while, he, was, elected, constitutional, president, in, 1917, he, did, not, implement, its, most, revolutionary, elements, particularly, those, dealing, with, land, reform, carranza, came, from, the, old, porfirian, landowning, class, and, was, repulsed, by, peasant, demand, for, redistribution, of, land, and, their, expectation, that, land, seized, would, not, revert, to, their, previous, owners, radical, reforms, were, embedded, in, the, constitution, in, particular, labor, rights, agrarian, reform, anticlericalism, and, economic, nationalism, the, mexican, state, asserted, dominion, over, the, nation, s, territory, and, resources, article, 27, which, enabled, land, reform, and, expropriation, of, land, labor, was, rewarded, with, a, strong, article, in, the, 1917, constitution, protecting, labor, rights, article, 123, following, the, ratification, of, the, constitution, carranza, was, formally, elected, to, the, presidency, of, mexico, carranza, and, his, political, allies, were, opposed, to, creating, a, constitution, that, went, beyond, tinkering, with, the, organizational, framework, of, the, 1857, constitution, the, progressive, faction, pejoratively, called, jacobins, by, their, opponents, pushed, for, a, constitution, that, enshrined, new, rights, in, the, constitution, itself, rather, than, trusting, that, the, head, of, state, and, the, apparatus, of, government, would, honor, the, gains, although, revolutionary, generals, were, not, part, formal, delegates, to, the, convention, lvaro, obreg, n, indirectly, then, directly, sided, with, the, progressives, against, carranza, in, historian, frank, tannenbaum, s, assessment, the, constitution, was, written, by, the, soldiers, of, the, revolution, not, by, the, lawyers, who, were, there, but, were, generally, in, opposition, the, constitution, was, drafted, and, ratified, quickly, in, february, 1917, in, december, 1916, villa, had, captured, the, major, northern, city, of, torre, n, with, obreg, n, especially, realizing, that, villa, was, a, continuing, threat, to, the, constitutionalist, regime, zapata, and, his, peasant, followers, in, morelos, also, never, put, down, their, guns, and, remained, a, threat, to, the, government, in, mexico, city, incorporating, radical, aspects, of, villa, s, program, and, the, zapatistas, plan, of, ayala, the, constitution, became, a, way, to, outflank, the, two, opposing, revolutionary, factions, carranza, was, elected, president, under, the, new, constitution, and, once, formally, in, office, largely, ignored, or, actively, undermined, the, more, radical, aspects, of, the, constitution, obreg, n, returned, to, sonora, and, began, building, a, power, base, that, would, launch, his, presidential, campaign, in, 1919, which, included, the, new, labor, organization, headed, by, luis, n, morones, the, regional, confederation, of,

opposition, from, peasants, in, an, attempt, to, suppress, the, continuing, armed, opposition, conflict, in, morelos, carranza, sent, general, pablo, gonz, lez, with, troops, going, further, carranza, ordered, the, assassination, of, emiliano, zapata, in, 1919, it, was, a, huge, blow, but, zapatista, general, genovevo, de, la, o, continued, to, lead, the, armed, struggle, there, from, the, late, porfiriato, until, his, assassination, by, an, agent, of, president, carranza, in, 1919, emiliano, zapata, played, an, important, role, in, the, mexican, revolution, the, only, revolutionary, of, first, rank, from, southern, mexico, his, home, territory, in, morelos, was, of, strategic, importance, just, south, of, mexico, city, of, the, revolutionary, factions, it, was, the, most, homogeneous, with, most, fighters, being, free, peasants, and, only, few, peons, on, haciendas, with, no, industry, to, speak, of, in, morelos, there, were, no, industrial, workers, in, the, movement, and, no, middle, class, participants, a, few, intellectuals, supported, the, zapatistas, the, zapatistas, armed, opposition, movement, just, south, of, the, capital, needed, to, be, heeded, by, those, in, power, in, mexico, city, unlike, northern, mexico, close, to, the, u, s, border, and, access, to, arms, sales, from, there, the, zapatista, territory, in, morelos, was, geographically, isolated, from, access, to, arms, the, zapatistas, did, not, appeal, for, support, to, international, interests, nor, play, a, role, in, international, politics, the, way, pancho, villa, the, other, major, populist, leader, did, the, movement, s, goal, was, for, land, reform, in, morelos, and, restoration, of, the, rights, of, communities, the, zapatistas, were, divided, into, guerrilla, fighting, forces, that, joined, together, for, major, battles, before, returning, to, their, home, villages, zapata, was, not, a, peasant, himself, but, led, peasants, in, his, home, state, in, regionally, concentrated, warfare, to, regain, village, lands, and, return, to, subsistence, agriculture, morelos, was, the, only, region, where, land, reform, was, enacted, during, the, years, of, fighting, zapata, initially, supported, madero, since, his, plan, de, san, luis, potos, had, promised, land, reform, but, madero, negotiated, a, settlement, with, the, d, az, regime, that, continued, its, power, once, elected, in, november, 1911, madero, did, not, move, on, land, reform, prompting, zapata, to, rebel, against, him, and, draft, the, plan, of, ayala, 1911, with, the, overthrow, of, madero, and, murder, zapata, disavowed, his, previous, admiration, of, pascual, orozco, and, directed, warfare, against, the, huerta, government, as, did, northern, states, of, mexico, in, the, constitutionalist, movement, but, zapata, did, not, ally, or, coordinate, with, it, with, the, defeat, of, huerta, in, july, 1914, zapata, loosely, allied, with, pancho, villa, who, had, split, from, venustiano, carranza, and, the, constitutionalist, army, the, loose, zapata, villa, alliance, lasted, until, obreg, n, decisively, defeated, villa, in, a, series, of, battles, in, 1915, including, the, battle, of, celaya, zapata, continued, to, oppose, the, constitutionalists, but, lost, support, in, his, own, area, and, attempted, to, entice, defectors, back, to, his, movement, that, was, a, fatal, error, he, was, ambushed, and, killed, on, 10, april, 1919, by, agents, of, now, president, venustiano, carranza, photos, were, taken, of, his, corpse, demonstrating, that, he, had, indeed, been, killed, although, zapata, was, assassinated, the, agrarian, reforms, that, peasants, themselves, enacted, in, morelos, were, impossible, to, reverse, the, central, government, came, to, terms, with, that, state, of, affairs, zapata, had, fought, for, land, and, for, those, who, tilled, it, in, morelos, and, succeeded, his, credentials, as, a, steadfast, revolutionary, made, him, an, enduring, hero, of, the, revolution, his, name, and, image, were, invoked, in, the, 1994, uprising, in, chiapas, with, the, zapatista, army, of, national, liberation, even, as, carranza, s, political, authority, was, waning, he, attempted, to, impose, a, political, nobody, mexico, s, ambassador, to, the, u, s, ignacio, bonillas, as, his, successor, under, the, plan, of, agua, prieta, a, triumvirate, of, sonoran, generals, lvaro, obreg, n, plutarco, el, as, calles, and, adolfo, de, la, huerta, with, elements, from, the, military, and, labor, supporters, in, the, crom, rose, in, successful, rebellion, against, carranza, the, last, successful, coup, of, the, revolution, carranza, fled, mexico, city, by, train, toward, veracruz, but, continued, on, horseback, and, died, in, an, ambush, perhaps, an, assassination, but, also, possibly, by, suicide, carranza, s, attempt, to, impose, his, choice, was, considered, a, betrayal, of, the, revolution, and, his, remains, were, not, placed, in, the, monument, to, the, revolution, until, 1942, obreg, n, and, the, sonorans, the, architects, of, carranza, s, rise, and, fall, shared, his, hard, headed, opportunism, but, they, displayed, a, better, grasp, of, the, mechanisms, of, popular, mobilization, allied, to, social, reform, that, would, form, the, bases, of, a, durable, revolutionary, regime, after, 1920, the, interim, government, of, adolfo, de, la, huerta, negotiated, pancho, villa, s, surrender, in, 1920, rewarding, him, with, an, hacienda, where, he, lived, in, peace, until, he, floated, political, interest, in, the, 1924, election, villa, was, assassinated, in, july, 1923, lvaro, obreg, n, was, elected, president, in, october, 1920, the, first, of, a, string, of, revolutionary, generals, calles, rodr, guez, c, rdenas, and, vila, camacho, to, hold, the, presidency, until, 1946, when, miguel, alem, n, the, son, of, a, revolutionary, general, was, elected, the, period, 1920, 1940, is, generally, considered, to, be, one, of, revolutionary, consolidation, with, the, leaders, seeking, to, return, mexico, to, the, level, of, development, it, had, reached, in, 1910, but, under, new, parameters, of, state, control, authoritarian, tendencies, rather, than, liberal, democratic, principles, characterized, the, period, with, generals, of, the, revolution, holding, the, presidency, and, designating, their, successors, revolutionary, generals, continued, to, revolt, against, the, new, political, arrangements, particularly, at, the, juncture, of, an, election, general, adolfo, de, la, huerta, rose, in, rebellion, in, 1923, contesting, obreg, n, s, choice, of, calles, as, his, successor, generals, arnulfo, g, mez, and, francisco, serrano, revolted, in, 1928, contesting, obreg, n, s, bid, for, a, second, term, as, president, and, general, jos, gonzalo, escobar, revolted, in, 1929, against, calles, who, remained, a, power, behind, the, presidency, with, the, assassination, of, obreg, n, in, 1928, all, these, revolts, were, unsuccessful, in, the, late, 1920s, anticlerical, provisions, of, the, 1917, constitution, were, stringently, enforced, leading, to, a, major, grassroots, uprising, against, the, government, the, bloody, cristero, war, that, lasted, from, 1926, to, 1929, although, the, period, is, characterized, as, a, consolidation, of, the, revolution, who, ruled, mexico, and, the, policies, the, government, pursued, were, met, with, violence, there, is, no, consensus, when, the, revolution, ended, but, the, majority, of, scholars, consider, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, as, being, on, the, continuum, of, revolutionary, change, the, end, date, of, revolutionary, consolidation, has, also, been, set, at, 1946, with, the, last, general, serving, as, president, and, the, political, party, morphing, into, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, in, 1920, sonoran, revolutionary, general, lvaro, obreg, n, was, elected, president, of, mexico, and, inaugurated, in, december, 1920, following, the, coup, engineered, by, him, and, revolutionary, generals, plutarco, el, as, calles, and, adolfo, de, la, huerta, the, coup, was, supported, by, other, revolutionary, generals, against, the, civilian, carranza, attempting, to, impose, another, civilian, ignacio, bonillas, as, his, successor, obreg, n, did, not, have, to, deal, with, two, major, revolutionary, leaders, de, la, huerta, managed, to, persuade, revolutionary, general, pancho, villa, to, lay, down, his, arms, against, the, regime, in, return, for, a, large, estate, in, durango, in, northern, mexico, carranza, s, agents, had, assassinated, emiliano, zapata, in, 1919, removing, a, consistent, and, effective, opponent, some, counterrevolutionaries, in, chiapas, laid, down, their, arms, the, only, pro, carranza, governor, to, resist, the, regime, change, was, esteban, cant, in, baja, california, suppressed, by, northern, revolutionary, general, abelardo, rodr, guez, later, to, become, president, of, mexico, although, the, 1917, constitution, was, not, fully, implemented, and, parts, of, the, country, were, still, controlled, by, local, strongmen, caciques, obreg, n, s, presidency, did, begin, consolidation, of, parts, of, the, revolutionary, agenda, including, expanded, rights, of, labor, and, the, peasantry, obreg, n, was, a, pragmatist, and, not, an, ideologue, so, that, domestically, he, had, to, appeal, to, both, the, left, and, the, right, to, ensure, mexico, would, not, fall, back, into, civil, war, securing, labor, rights, built, on, obreg, n, s, existing, relationship, with, urban, labor, the, constitutionists, had, made, an, alliance, with, labor, during, the, revolution, mobilizing, the, red, battalions, against, zapata, s, and, villa, s, force, this, alliance, continued, under, obreg, n, s, and, calles, s, terms, as, president, obreg, n, also, focused, on, land, reform, he, had, governors, in, various, states, push, forward, the, reforms, promised, in, the, 1917, constitution, these, were, however, quite, limited, former, zapatistas, still, had, strong, influence, in, the, post, revolutionary, government, so, most, of, the, reforms, began, in, morelos, the, birthplace, of, the, zapatista, movement, obreg, n, s, government, was, faced, with, the, need, for, stabilizing, mexico, after, a, decade, of, civil, war, with, the, revolutionary, armies, having, defeated, the, old, federal, army, obreg, n, now, dealt, with, military, leaders, who, were, used, to, wielding, power, violently, enticing, them, to, leave, the, political, arena, in, exchange, for, material, rewards, was, one, tactic, de, la, huerta, had, already, successfully, used, it, with, pancho, villa, not, trusting, villa, to, remain, on, the, sidelines, obreg, n, had, him, assassinated, in, 1923, in, 1923, de, la, huerta, rebelled, against, obreg, n, and, his, choice, of, calles, as, his, successor, as, president, leading, to, a, split, in, the, military, the, rebellion, was, suppressed, and, obreg, n, began, to, professionalize, the, military, reduced, the, number, of, troops, by, half, and, forced, officers, to, retire, obreg, n, 1920, 24, followed, by, calles, 1924, 28, viewed, bringing, the, armed, forces, under, state, control, as, essential, to, stabilizing, mexico, downsizing, the, military, meant, that, state, funds, were, freed, up, for, other, priorities, especially, education, obreg, n, s, minister, of, education, jos, vasconcelos, initiated, innovative, broad, educational, and, cultural, programs, obreg, n, sought, diplomatic, recognition, by, the, u, s, in, order, to, be, considered, legitimately, holding, power, he, believed, that, once, u, s, recognition, was, secured, other, nations, would, follow, suit, the, u, s, and, foreign, interests, were, alarmed, at, provision, in, the, new, constitution, powering, the, government, to, expropriate, private, property, and, foreigners, also, had, claims, against, mexico, for, damage, to, their, property, during, the, decade, of, turmoil, u, s, and, british, entrepreneurs, had, developed, the, petroleum, industry, in, mexico, and, had, claims, to, oil, still, in, the, ground, foreigners, held, extensive, agricultural, land, that, was, now, at, risk, to, be, distributed, to, landless, mexicans, obreg, n, and, the, u, s, entered, in, talks, to, sort, out, many, issues, the, bucareli, treaty, concluded, in, 1923, with, the, u, s, recognizing, obreg, n, s, government, in, mexico, the, agreement, was, controversial, with, it, being, perceived, as, making, major, concessions, to, the, u, s, and, undermining, revolutionary, goals, but, obreg, n, pushed, it, through, the, legislature, and, got, u, s, recognition, when, his, fellow, sonoran, general, de, la, huerta, rebelled, later, in, 1923, the, u, s, supplied, obreg, n, with, arms, to, put, down, the, challenge, in, an, attempt, to, buffer, his, regime, against, further, coups, calles, began, arming, peasants, and, factory, workers, with, surplus, weapons, he, continued, other, reforms, pushed, by, his, predecessor, but, calles, was, virulently, anti, clerical, and, unlike, obreg, n, who, largely, avoided, direct, conflict, with, the, catholic, church, calles, as, president, enforced, the, anticlerical, provisions, of, the, 1917, constitution, calles, also, put, into, effect, a, national, school, system, that, was, largely, secular, to, combat, church, influence, in, late, 1924, after, two, years, the, state, crackdown, the, catholic, church, protested, by, going, on, its, version, of, a, strike, refusing, to, baptize, marry, give, last, rites, or, give, communion, to, parishioners, many, peasants, also, joined, in, opposition, to, the, state, s, crackdown, on, religion, beginning, the, cristero, war, named, for, their, clarion, call, viva, cristo, rey, long, live, christ, the, king, it, was, a, lengthy, major, uprising, against, the, revolutionary, vision, of, the, mexican, state, in, central, mexico, not, a, short, lived, localized, rebellion, calles, s, stringent, enforcement, of, anticlerical, laws, had, an, impact, on, the, presidential, succession, with, calles, s, comrade, and, chosen, successor, ex, president, and, president, elect, obreg, n, being, assassinated, by, a, religious, fanatic, in, 1928, plunging, the, political, system, into, a, major, crisis, by, law, calles, could, not, be, re, elected, but, a, solution, needed, to, be, found, to, keep, political, power, in, the, hands, of, the, revolutionary, elite, and, prevent, the, country, from, reverting, to, civil, war, with, the, 1917, constitution, enshrining, the, principle, of, no, re, election, revolutionaries, who, had, fought, for, the, principle, could, not, ignore, it, elections, were, when, disgruntled, aspirants, to, the, presidency, made, their, move, because, it, was, a, period, of, political, transition, the, sonoran, triumvirate, had, done, so, in, 1920, in, 1923, de, la, huerta, rebelled, against, obreg, n, s, choice, of, calles, rather, than, himself, as, candidate, when, calles, designated, ex, president, obreg, n, to, succeed, him, permitted, by, a, constitutional, amendment, the, principle, of, no, re, elected, was, technically, adhered, to, but, there, was, the, clear, possibility, of, an, endless, alternation, of, the, two, powerful, men, other, rebellions, of, revolutionary, generals, broke, out, in, 1927, by, francisco, serrano, and, arnulfo, r, g, mez, which, was, suppressed, and, the, leaders, executed, obreg, n, was, elected, but, assassinated, before, he, took, office, plunging, the, country, into, a, political, crisis, over, presidential, succession, since, the, mexican, revolution, had, been, sparked, by, the, 1910, re, election, of, d, az, calles, and, others, were, well, aware, that, the, situation, could, spiral, out, of, control, this, political, crisis, came, when, the, bloody, cristero, war, raged, across, central, mexico, a, managed, political, solution, to, the, crisis, of, presidential, succession, had, to, be, found, the, answer, was, the, founding, of, the, partido, nacional, revolucionario, in, 1929, calles, brought, together, the, various, factions, mainly, regional, strongmen, calles, himself, could, not, become, president, again, but, he, remained, a, powerful, figure, the, jefe, m, ximo, in, a, period, called, the, maximato, three, men, held, the, presidency, in, what, would, have, been, obreg, n, second, term, to, alternation, of, the, presidency, by, men, who, had, previously, held, the, office, the, constitution, was, revised, reverted, to, the, principle, of, no, re, election, an, achievement, in, this, period, was, the, 1929, peace, agreement, between, the, catholic, church, and, the, mexican, state, brokered, by, dwight, morrow, u, s, ambassador, to, mexico, the, church, state, conflict, went, into, hibernation, following, the, designation, of, general, manuel, vila, camacho, to, succeed, president, l, zaro, c, rdenas, in, 1940, in, 1934, calles, chose, l, zaro, c, rdenas, as, the, pnr, s, presidential, candidate, unlike, his, three, predecessors, controlled, by, calles, c, rdenas, threw, off, the, jefe, m, ximo, s, power, and, set, about, implementing, a, re, vitalilzed, revolutionary, agenda, he, vastly, expanded, agrarian, reform, expropriated, commercial, landed, estates, nationalized, the, railways, and, the, petroleum, industry, kept, the, peace, with, the, catholic, church, as, an, institution, put, down, a, major, rebellion, by, saturnino, cedillo, founded, a, new, political, party, that, created, sectoral, representation, of, industrial, workers, peasants, urban, office, workers, and, the, army, engineered, the, succession, of, his, hand, picked, candidate, and, then, perhaps, the, most, radical, act, of, all, stepped, away, from, presidential, power, letting, his, successor, general, manuel, vila, camacho, to, exercise, fully, presidential, power, c, rdenas, came, from, the, southern, state, of, michoacan, but, during, the, revolution, had, fought, in, the, north, rising, to, the, rank, of, general, and, becoming, a, part, of, the, northern, dynasty, he, returned, to, michoacan, after, the, revolution, and, implemented, a, number, of, reforms, that, were, precursors, of, those, he, enacted, as, president, with, calles, s, founding, of, the, pnr, c, rdenas, became, part, of, the, party, apparatus, calles, had, no, idea, that, c, rdenas, was, as, politically, savvy, as, he, turned, out, to, be, managing, to, oust, calles, from, his, role, as, the, power, behind, the, presidency, and, forcing, him, into, exile, calles, had, increasingly, moved, to, the, political, right, abandoning, support, for, land, reform, peasants, who, had, joined, the, revolution, with, the, hope, that, land, reform, would, be, enacted, and, the, constitution, had, empowered, the, state, to, expropriate, land, and, other, resources, during, c, rdenas, s, presidency, he, expropriated, and, distributed, land, and, organized, peasant, leagues, incorporating, them, into, the, political, system, although, in, theory, peasants, and, workers, could, come, together, as, a, single, powerful, sector, the, pnr, ruled, that, peasant, organizations, were, to, be, separate, from, industrial, labor, and, organizing, the, countryside, should, be, under, the, control, of, the, party, c, rdenas, encouraged, working, class, organizations, and, sought, to, bring, them, into, the, political, system, under, state, control, the, crom, an, umbrella, labor, organization, had, declined, in, power, with, the, ouster, of, calles, radical, labor, leader, vicente, lombardo, toledano, helped, create, the, confederation, of, mexican, workers, ctm, a, nationalist, autonomous, non, politically, affiliated, organization, communists, in, the, labor, movement, were, aligned, with, the, moscow, controlled, communist, international, and, c, rdenas, sought, to, strengthen, the, mexican, labor, organization, aligned, with, the, mexican, revolutionary, state, his, first, acts, of, reform, in, 1935, were, aimed, towards, peasants, former, strongmen, within, the, land, owning, community, were, losing, political, power, so, he, began, to, side, with, the, peasants, more, and, more, he, also, tried, to, further, centralize, the, government, s, power, by, removing, regional, caciques, allowing, him, to, push, reforms, easier, to, fill, the, political, vacuum, c, rdenas, helped, the, formation, of, pnr, sponsored, peasant, leagues, empowering, both, peasants, and, the, government, other, reforms, included, nationalization, of, key, industries, such, as, petroleum, and, the, railroads, to, appease, workers, c, rdenas, furthered, provisions, to, end, debt, peonage, and, company, stores, which, were, largely, eliminated, under, his, rule, except, in, the, most, backwater, areas, of, mexico, to, prevent, conservative, factions, in, the, military, from, plotting, and, to, put, idle, soldiers, to, work, c, rdenas, mobilized, the, military, to, build, public, works, projects, that, same, year, another, cristero, revolt, occurred, this, was, partially, caused, by, c, rdenas, mandate, for, secular, education, early, in, his, presidency, in, 1934, the, cristeros, were, not, supported, by, the, catholic, hierarchy, and, c, rdenas, quashed, the, revolt, the, catholic, church, told, rebels, to, surrender, themselves, to, the, government, in, the, next, year, 1936, to, further, stabilize, his, rule, c, rdenas, further, armed, the, peasants, and, workers, and, begins, to, organize, them, into, formal, militias, this, proved, to, be, useful, later, in, his, presidency, as, the, militias, came, to, his, aid, in, a, military, coup, in, revolutionary, mexico, in, 1938, seeing, no, opposition, from, the, bourgeoisie, generals, or, conservative, landlords, in, 1936, c, rdenas, began, building, collective, agricultural, enterprises, called, ejidos, to, help, give, peasants, access, to, land, mostly, in, southern, mexico, these, appeased, some, agriculturalists, but, many, peasants, would, have, preferred, receiving, individual, plots, of, land, to, which, they, had, title, the, aim, of, ejidos, was, to, replace, the, large, scale, landed, estates, many, of, which, were, foreign, owned, andr, s, molina, enr, quez, the, intellectual, father, of, article, 27, of, the, constitution, empowering, the, state, to, expropriate, property, criticized, the, move, saying, that, the, state, itself, was, replacing, private, landowners, while, the, peasants, remained, tied, to, the, land, ejidos, were, not, very, good, at, feeding, large, populations, causing, an, urban, food, crisis, to, alleviate, this, c, rdenas, co, opted, the, support, of, capitalists, to, build, large, commercial, farms, to, feed, the, urban, population, this, put, the, final, nail, in, the, coffin, of, the, feudal, hacienda, system, making, mexico, a, mixed, economy, combining, agrarian, socialism, and, industrial, capitalism, by, 1940, c, rdenas, dissolved, the, revolutionary, party, founded, by, calles, and, established, a, new, party, the, partido, de, la, revoluci, n, mexicana, organized, by, sectors, there, were, four, sectors, industrial, workers, peasants, middle, class, workers, largely, employed, by, the, government, and, the, army, bringing, the, military, into, the, party, structure, was, controversial, privately, opposed, by, general, manuel, avila, camacho, who, succeeded, c, rdenas, and, in, the, final, reformulation, of, the, party, removed, the, military, sector, c, rdenas, calculated, to, manage, the, military, politically, and, to, remove, it, from, independently, intervening, in, politics, and, to, keep, it, from, becoming, a, separate, caste, this, new, party, organization, was, a, resurrection, of, corporatism, essentially, organization, by, estates, or, interest, groups, the, party, was, reorganized, once, again, in, 1946, as, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, which, kept, sectoral, representation, but, eliminated, the, military, as, a, sector, c, rdenas, left, office, in, 1940, at, age, 45, his, departure, marked, the, end, of, the, social, revolution, and, ushering, in, half, a, century, of, relative, stability, however, in, the, assessment, of, historian, alan, knight, the, 1940, election, was, a, requiem, for, cardenismo, it, revealed, that, hopes, of, a, democratic, succession, were, illusory, that, electoral, endorsement, of, the, regime, had, to, be, manufactured, and, that, the, cardenista, reforms, while, creating, certain, loyal, clienteles, some, loyal, from, conviction, some, by, virtue, of, co, optation, had, also, raised, up, formidable, opponents, who, now, looked, to, take, the, offensive, he, had, a, long, and, lustrous, post, presidency, remaining, influential, in, political, life, and, considered, the, moral, conscience, of, the, revolution, c, rdenas, and, his, supporters, carried, reforms, further, than, any, of, their, predecessors, in, mexico, or, their, counterparts, in, other, latin, american, countries, the, most, obvious, acts, of, violence, which, occurred, during, the, revolution, involved, soldiers, participating, in, combat, or, summary, executions, the, actual, fighting, which, occurred, during, the, maderista, phase, of, the, revolution, 1910, 11, did, not, result, in, a, large, number, of, casualties, but, during, the, huerta, era, the, federal, army, summarily, executed, rebel, soldiers, and, the, constitutionalist, army, executed, federal, army, officers, there, were, no, prisoner, of, war, internment, camps, often, rank, and, file, soldiers, of, a, losing, faction, were, incorporated, as, troops, by, the, ones, who, defeated, them, the, revolutionaries, were, not, ideologically, driven, so, they, did, not, target, their, rivals, for, reprisals, and, they, did, not, wage, a, revolutionary, terror, against, them, after, they, triumphed, in, contrast, to, the, french, and, russian, revolutions, an, exception, to, this, pattern, of, behavior, in, the, history, of, mexico, occurred, in, the, aftermath, of, its, nineteenth, century, wars, against, indigenous, rebels, the, death, toll, of, the, combatants, was, not, as, large, as, it, might, have, been, because, the, opposing, armies, rarely, engaged, in, open, field, combat, the, revolutionaries, initially, operated, as, guerrilla, bands, and, they, launched, hit, and, run, strikes, against, the, enemy, they, drew, the, federal, army, into, combat, on, terms, which, were, favorable, to, them, they, did, not, engage, in, open, battle, nor, did, they, attack, heavily, defended, positions, they, acquired, weapons, and, ammunition, which, were, abandoned, by, federal, forces, and, they, also, commandeered, resources, from, landed, estates, and, used, them, to, feed, their, men, the, federal, army, was, unable, to, stray, from, the, railway, lines, that, transported, them, to, contested, areas, and, they, were, unable, to, pursue, the, revolutionaries, when, they, were, attacked, the, death, toll, and, the, displacement, of, the, population, due, to, the, revolution, is, difficult, to, calculate, mexico, s, population, loss, of, 15, million, was, high, but, numerical, estimates, vary, greatly, perhaps, 1, 5, million, people, died, and, nearly, 200, 000, refugees, fled, abroad, especially, to, the, united, states, the, violence, caused, by, the, mexican, revolution, resulted, in, mexican, immigration, to, the, united, states, increasing, five, fold, from, 1910, to, 1920, with, 100, 000, mexicans, entering, the, united, states, by, 1920, seeking, better, economic, conditions, social, stability, and, political, stability, the, violence, which, occurred, during, the, revolution, did, not, just, involve, the, largely, male, combatants, it, also, involved, civilian, populations, of, men, women, and, children, some, ethnic, groups, were, deliberately, targeted, most, particularly, the, chinese, in, northern, mexico, during, the, maderista, campaign, in, northern, mexico, there, was, anti, chinese, violence, particularly, the, may, 1911, massacre, at, torre, n, a, major, railway, hub, in, 1905, anti, chinese, sentiment, was, espoused, in, the, liberal, party, program, of, 1905, landed, estates, many, of, which, were, owned, by, foreigners, were, targeted, for, looting, the, crops, and, animals, were, sold, or, they, were, used, by, the, revolutionaries, the, owners, of, some, estates, were, killed, in, the, wake, of, the, revolution, a, joint, american, mexican, claims, commission, assessed, the, monetary, damage, and, the, amount, of, the, monetary, compensation, which, was, due, cities, were, the, prizes, in, revolutionary, clashes, and, many, of, them, were, severely, damaged, a, notable, exception, is, mexico, city, which, only, sustained, damage, during, the, days, leading, up, to, the, ouster, and, murder, of, madero, when, rebels, shelled, the, central, core, of, the, capital, causing, the, death, of, many, civilians, and, animals, the, rebels, launched, the, attack, in, an, attempt, to, convince, observers, in, mexico, and, the, world, that, madero, had, completely, lost, control, the, capital, changed, hands, several, times, during, the, post, huerta, period, when, the, conventionists, held, power, villa, and, his, men, committed, acts, of, violence, against, major, supporters, of, huerta, and, those, who, were, considered, revolutionary, traitors, with, impunity, villa, s, terror, was, not, on, the, same, scale, as, the, reigns, of, terror, which, occurred, during, the, french, and, bolshevik, revolutions, but, the, assassinations, and, the, kidnappings, of, wealthy, people, for, ransom, damaged, villa, s, reputation, and, they, also, caused, the, u, s, government, s, enthusiasm, for, him, to, cool, political, assassination, became, a, frequent, way, to, eliminate, rivals, both, during, and, after, the, revolution, all, of, the, major, leaders, of, the, revolution, were, later, assassinated, madero, in, 1913, zapata, in, 1919, carranza, in, 1920, villa, in, 1923, and, obreg, n, in, 1928, porfirio, d, az, victoriano, huerta, and, pascual, orozco, had, gone, into, exile, believing, that, he, would, also, go, into, exile, madero, turned, himself, into, huerta, s, custody, huerta, considered, that, too, dangerous, a, course, since, he, could, have, been, a, rallying, point, huerta, did, not, want, to, execute, madero, publicly, the, cover, story, of, madero, and, pino, su, rez, being, caught, in, the, crossfire, gave, huerta, plausible, deniability, he, needed, it, since, he, only, had, a, thin, veil, of, legitimacy, in, his, ascention, to, the, presidency, the, bodies, of, madero, and, pino, su, rez, were, not, photographed, nor, were, they, displayed, but, pictures, of, madero, s, clothing, were, taken, showing, bullet, holes, in, the, back, zapata, s, death, in, 1919, was, at, the, hands, of, carranza, s, military, there, was, no, need, for, a, coverup, since, he, had, remained, a, threat, to, the, carranza, regime, photos, of, the, dead, zapata, were, taken, and, published, as, proof, of, his, demise, but, carranza, was, tainted, by, the, deed, the, economic, damage, which, the, revolution, caused, lasted, for, years, the, population, losses, which, were, due, to, military, and, civilian, casualties, the, displacement, of, populations, which, migrated, to, safer, areas, and, the, damage, to, the, infrastructure, all, had, significant, impacts, the, nation, would, not, regain, the, level, of, development, which, it, reached, in, 1910, for, another, twenty, years, the, railway, lines, which, were, constructed, during, the, porfiriato, facilitated, the, movement, of, men, horses, and, artillery, and, they, were, extensively, used, by, all, of, the, factions, this, was, much, greater, in, northern, mexico, it, was, less, so, in, the, areas, controlled, by, zapata, when, men, and, horses, were, transported, by, rail, the, soldiers, rode, on, the, tops, of, boxcars, railway, lines, engines, and, rolling, stock, were, targeted, for, sabotage, and, the, rebuilding, of, tracks, and, bridges, was, an, ongoing, issue, major, battles, in, the, north, were, fought, along, railway, lines, or, railway, junctions, such, as, torre, n, early, on, northern, revolutionaries, also, added, hospital, cars, so, the, wounded, could, be, treated, horses, remained, important, in, troop, movements, they, were, either, directly, ridden, to, combat, zones, or, they, were, loaded, on, trains, infantry, also, still, played, a, role, arms, purchases, mainly, from, the, united, states, gave, northern, armies, almost, inexhaustible, access, to, rifles, and, ammunition, so, long, as, they, had, the, means, to, pay, for, them, new, military, technology, particularly, machine, guns, mechanized, death, on, a, large, scale, el, paso, texas, became, a, major, supplier, of, weaponry, to, the, constitutionalist, army, there, was, considerable, cultural, production, during, the, revolution, itself, including, printmaking, music, and, photography, while, in, the, post, revolutionary, era, revolutionary, themes, in, painting, and, literature, shaped, historical, memory, and, understanding, of, the, revolution, anti, d, az, publications, before, the, outbreak, of, the, revolution, helped, galvanize, opposition, to, him, and, he, cracked, down, with, censorship, as, president, madero, believed, in, freedom, of, the, press, which, helped, galvanize, opposition, to, his, own, regime, the, constitutionalists, had, an, active, propaganda, program, paying, writers, to, draft, appeals, to, opinion, in, the, u, s, and, to, disparage, the, reputations, of, villa, and, zapata, as, reactionaries, bandits, and, unenlightened, peasants, el, paso, texas, just, across, from, ciudad, ju, rez, was, an, important, site, for, revolutionary, journalism, in, english, and, spanish, mariano, azuela, wrote, los, de, abajo, the, underdogs, in, el, paso, and, published, in, serial, form, there, the, alliance, carranza, made, with, the, casa, del, obrero, mundial, helped, fund, that, appealed, to, the, urban, working, class, particularly, in, early, 1915, before, obreg, n, s, victories, over, villa, and, gonz, lez, s, over, zapata, once, the, armed, opposition, was, less, of, a, threat, carranza, dissolved, vanguardia, as, a, publication, meanwhile, in, the, united, states, mexican, americans, created, newspapers, to, help, with, the, war, effort, denouncing, diaz, s, regime, as, well, as, professing, their, support, to, the, revolution, there, were, multiple, newspapers, written, in, the, spanish, language, most, notably, la, cronica, the, chronicle, in, english, created, by, nicasio, idar, and, his, family, in, laredo, texas, a, city, which, saw, much, action, as, a, border, town, la, cronica, as, well, as, other, chicano, newspapers, would, mostly, cover, stories, about, the, mexican, american, and, tejano, communities, in, the, border, regions, as, well, as, supporting, the, revolution, these, articles, were, named, fronterizo, by, the, border, in, english, a, newspaper, dedicated, to, describing, life, in, the, border, regions, which, would, write, about, mexican, americans, and, their, long, rooted, history, and, culture, pertaining, to, these, lands, as, people, living, by, the, international, border, would, be, called, fronterizos, border, dwellers, these, fronterizos, would, start, out, with, two, goals, to, decry, the, racism, and, discrimination, experienced, by, mexicans, and, mexicans, americans, in, the, united, states, and, to, support, the, ongoing, reforms, in, mexico, equating, the, tyranny, of, porfirio, d, az, to, that, of, white, texan, politicians, a, month, after, the, start, of, the, conflict, idar, from, la, cronica, argued, that, mexican, immigrants, and, american, born, mexican, americans, should, be, inspired, by, the, revolution, s, promise, of, land, reform, to, fight, for, more, civil, rights, in, the, united, states, fronterizos, worked, to, produce, a, nationalistic, perspective, placing, the, borderlands, as, an, integral, part, of, mexican, culture, history, and, as, a, crucial, part, to, the, revolution, as, the, borderlands, and, its, communities, have, been, ignored, by, both, the, united, states, and, mexican, governments, during, the, late, porfiriato, political, cartooning, and, print, making, developed, as, popular, forms, of, art, the, most, well, known, print, maker, of, that, period, is, jos, guadalupe, posada, whose, satirical, prints, particularly, featuring, skeletons, circulated, widely, posada, died, in, early, 1913, so, his, caricatures, are, only, of, the, early, revolution, one, published, in, el, vale, panchito, entitled, oratory, and, music, shows, madero, atop, a, pile, of, papers, and, the, plan, of, san, luis, potos, haranguing, a, dark, skinned, mexican, whose, large,

as, americans, caricatured, the, situation, in, mexico, for, a, mass, readership, political, broadsides, including, songs, of, the, revolutionary, period, were, also, a, popular, form, of, visual, art, after, 1920, mexican, muralism, and, printmaking, were, two, major, forms, of, revolutionary, art, prints, were, easily, reproducible, and, circulated, widely, while, murals, commissioned, by, the, mexican, government, necessitated, a, journey, to, view, them, printmaking, emerged, as, a, favored, medium, alongside, government, sponsored, mural, painting, among, artists, ready, to, do, battle, for, a, new, aesthetic, as, well, as, a, new, political, order, diego, rivera, better, known, for, his, painting, than, printmaking, reproduced, his, depiction, of, zapata, in, the, murals, in, the, cort, s, palace, in, cuernavaca, in, a, 1932, print, the, mexican, revolution, was, extensively, photographed, as, well, as, filmed, so, that, there, is, a, large, contemporaneous, visual, record, the, mexican, revolution, and, photography, were, intertwined, there, was, a, large, foreign, viewership, for, still, and, moving, images, of, the, revolution, the, photographic, record, is, by, no, means, complete, since, much, of, the, violence, took, place, in, relatively, remote, places, but, it, was, a, media, event, covered, by, photographers, photojournalists, and, professional, cinematographers, those, behind, the, lens, were, hampered, by, the, large, heavy, cameras, that, impeded, capturing, action, images, but, no, longer, was, written, text, enough, with, photographs, illustrating, and, verifying, the, written, word, the, revolution, depended, heavily, from, its, inception, on, visual, representations, and, in, particular, on, photographs, the, large, number, of, mexican, and, foreign, photographers, followed, the, action, and, stoked, public, interest, in, it, among, the, foreign, photographers, were, jimmy, hare, otis, a, aultman, homer, scott, and, walter,

revolution, were, well, aware, of, the, propaganda, element, of, documentary, film, making, and, pancho, villa, contracted, with, an, american, film, company, to, record, for, viewers, in, the, u, s, his, leadership, on, the, battlefield, the, film, has, been, lost, but, the, story, of, the, film, making, was, interpreted, in, the, hbo, scripted, film, and, starring, pancho, villa, as, himself, the, largest, collection, of, still, photographs, of, the, revolution, is, the, casasola, archive, named, for, photographer, agust, n, casasola, 1874, 1938, with, nearly, 500, 000, images, held, by,

revolution, the, big, three, of, mexican, muralism, diego, rivera, orozco, and, siqueiros, produced, narratives, of, the, revolution, shaping, historical, memory, and, interpretation, a, number, of, traditional, mexican, songs, or, corridos, were, written, at, the, time, serving, as, a, kind, of, news, report, and, functioned, as, propaganda, memorializing, aspects, of, the, mexican, revolution, the, term, adelitas, an, alternative, word, for, soldaderas, is, from, a, corrido, titled, la, adelita, the, song, la, cucaracha, with, numerous, verses, was, popular, at, the, time, of, the, revolution, and, subsequently, and, is, too, in, the, present, day, published, corridos, often, had, images, of, particular, revolutionary, heroes, along, with, the, verses, few, novels, of, the,

carlos, fuentes, particularly, the, death, of, artemio, cruz, the, revolution, and, its, perceived, betrayal, are, key, factors, in, driving, the, narrative, the, revolution, that, occurred, during, 1910, greatly, affected, gender, roles, present, in, mexico, however, it, continued, to, create, a, strict, separation, between, genders, although, both, men, and, women, were, involved, in, the, revolution, women, were, involved, by, promoting, political, reform, as, well, as, enlisting, in, the, military, women, who, were, involved, in, political, reform, would, create, reports, that, outlined, the, changes, people, wanted, to, see, in, their, area, that, type, of, activism, was, seen, inside, and, outside, of, the, cities, women, not, only, took, political, action, but, also, enlisted, in, the, military, and, became, teachers, to, contribute, to, the, change, that, they, wanted, to, see, after, the, revolution, women, were, seen, as, prizes, by, many, men, involved, in, the, military, being, involved, in, the, military, gave, men, a, greater, sense, of, superiority, over, women, which, gave, women, the, connotation, of, being, a, prize, that, idea, often, lead, to, violence, against, women, which, meanwhile, increased, after, the, revolution, the, ideas, women, contributed, to, the, revolution, were, put, on, hold, for, many, years, women, would, often, promote, the, ideas, of, establishing, a, greater, justice, system, and, creating, ideals, surrounded, by, democracy, the, revolution, caused, many, people, to, further, reinstate, the, idea, that, women, were, meant, to, be, taking, care, of, the, household, women, were, also, put, in, the, lower, part, of, the, social, class, because, of, this, idea, women, who, had, been, discarded, by, their, families, would, often, join, the, military, being, involved, in, the, military, would, lead, to, scrutiny, amongst, some, male, participants, in, order, to, avoid, sexual, abuse, many, women, would, make, themselves, appear, more, masculine, they, would, also, dress, more, masculine, in, order, to, gain, more, experience, with, handling, weapons, and, learning, more, about, military, jobs, an, example, of, this, is, presented, by, mar, a, de, jes, s, gonz, lez, who, was, a, secret, agent, involved, in, carranza, s, army, she, would, often, present, herself, as, a, man, in, order, to, complete, certain, tasks, assigned, to, her, after, she, completed, these, tasks, she, would, return, to, her, feminine, appearance, rosa, bodilla, however, maintained, her, feminine, appearance, throughout, her, military, career, she, joined, the, zapata, s, military, with, her, husband, when, he, died, she, was, given, his, title, which, became, colonel, rosa, bobadila, widow, of, casas, she, gave, orders, to, men, while, continuing, to, dress, as, a, woman, after, the, revolution, amelio, robles, continued, to, look, like, and, identify, as, a, male, for, the, rest, of, his, life, robles, abandoned, his, home, in, order, to, join, the, zapata, military, throughout, the, war, robles, began, to, assume, a, more, masculine, identity, after, the, war, he, did, not, return, to, his, former, appearance, like, other, females, had, robles, carried, on, with, his, life, as, amelio, and, remained, to, look, as, well, as, act, masculine, he, reestablished, himself, into, the, community, as, a, male, and, was, recognized, as, a, male, on, his, military, documents, there, is, a, vast, historiography, on, the, mexican, revolution, with, many, different, interpretations, of, the, history, over, time, it, has, become, more, fragmented, there, is, consensus, as, to, when, the, revolution, began, that, is, in, 1910, but, there, is, no, consensus, when, it, ended, the, constitutionalists, defeated, their, major, rivals, and, called, the, constitutional, convention, that, drafted, the, 1917, constitution, but, did, not, effectively, control, all, regions, the, year, 1920, was, the, last, successful, military, rebellion, bringing, the, northern, revolutionary, generals, to, power, according, to, lvaro, matute, by, the, time, obreg, n, was, sworn, in, as, president, on, december, 1, 1920, the, armed, stage, of, the, mexican, revolution, was, effectively, over, the, year, 1940, saw, revolutionary, general, and, president, l, zaro, c, rdenas, choose, manuel, avila, camacho, a, moderate, to, succeed, him, a, 1966, anthology, by, scholars, of, the, revolution, was, entitled, is, the, mexican, revolution, dead, historian, alan, knight, has, identified, orthodox, interpretation, of, the, revolution, as, a, monolithic, popular, nationalist, revolution, while, revisionism, has, focused, on, regional, differences, and, challenges, its, credentials, revolution, one, scholar, classifies, the, conflict, as, a, great, rebellion, rather, than, a, revolution, major, leaders, of, the, revolution, have, been, the, subject, of, biographies, including, the, martyred, francisco, i, madero, there, are, many, biographies, of, zapata, and, villa, whose, movements, did, not, achieve, power, along, with, studies, of, the, presidential, career, of, revolutionary, general, l, zaro, c, rdenas, in, recent, years, biographies, of, the, victorious, northerners, carranza, obreg, n, and, calles, have, reassessed, their, roles, in, the, revolution, sonorans, in, the, mexican, revolution, have, not, yet, collectively, been, the, subject, of, a, major, study, often, studied, as, an, event, solely, of, mexican, history, or, one, also, involving, mexico, s, northern, neighbor, scholars, now, recognize, that, from, the, beginning, to, the, end, foreign, activities, figured, crucially, in, the, revolution, s, course, not, simple, antagonism, from, the, u, s, government, but, complicated, euro, american, imperialist, rivalries, extremely, intricate, during, the, first, world, war, a, key, work, illuminating, the, international, aspects, of, the, revolution, is, friedrich, katz, s, 1981, work, the, secret, war, in, mexico, europe, the, united, states, and, the, mexican, revolution, the, centennial, of, the, mexican, revolution, was, another, occasion, to, construct, of, historical, of, the, events, and, leaders, in, 2010, the, centennial, of, the, revolution, and, the, bicentennial, of, independence, was, an, occasion, to, take, account, of, mexico, s, history, the, centennial, of, independence, in, 1910, had, been, the, swan, song, of, the, porfiriato, with, president, felipe, calder, n, 2006, 2012, of, the, conservative, national, action, party, there, was, considerable, emphasis, on, the, bicentennial, of, independence, rather, than, on, the, mexican, revolution, the, popular, heroes, of, the, mexican, revolution, are, the, two, radicals, who, lost, emiliano, zapata, and, pancho, villa, as, early, as, 1921, the, mexican, government, began, appropriating, the, memory, and, legacy, of, zapata, for, its, own, purposes, pancho, villa, fought, against, those, who, won, the, revolution, and, he, was, excluded, from, the, revolutionary, pantheon, for, a, considerable, time, but, his, memory, and, legend, remained, alive, among, the, mexican, people, the, government, recognized, his, continued, potency, and, had, his, remains, reburied, in, the, monument, of, the, revolution, after, considerable, controversy, with, the, exception, of, zapata, who, rebelled, against, him, in, 1911, francisco, madero, was, revered, as, the, apostle, of, democracy, madero, s, murder, in, the, 1913, counterrevolutionary, coup, elevated, him, as, a, martyr, of, the, revolution, whose, memory, unified, the, constitutionalist, coalition, against, huerta, venustiano, carranza, gained, considerable, legitimacy, as, a, civilian, leader, of, the, constitutionalists, having, supported, madero, in, life, and, led, the, successful, coalition, that, ousted, huerta, but, then, carranza, downplayed, madero, s, role, in, the, revolution, in, order, to, substitute, himself, as, the, origin, of, the, true, revolution, carranza, owned, the, bullets, taken, from, the, body, of, francisco, i, madero, after, his, murder, carranza, had, kept, them, in, his, home, perhaps, because, they, were, a, symbol, of, a, fate, and, a, passive, denouement, he, had, always, hoped, to, avoid, huerta, remains, the, enduring, villain, of, the, mexican, revolution, for, his, coup, against, madero, d, az, is, still, popularly, and, officially, reviled, although, there, was, an, attempt, to, rehabilitate, his, reputation, in, the, 1990s, by, president, carlos, salinas, de, gortari, who, was, implementing, the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, and, amending, the, constitution, to, eliminate, further,

revolutionary, women, known, as, coronelas, who, commanded, troops, some, of, whom, dressed, and, identified, as, male, they, do, not, fit, the, stereotypical, image, of, soldadera, and, are, not, celebrated, in, historical, memory, at, present, although, the, ignominious, end, of, venustiano, carranza, s, presidency, in, 1920, cast, a, shadow, over, his, legacy, in, the, revolution, sometimes, viewed, as, a, conservative, revolutionary, he, and, his, northern, allies, laid, the, foundation, of, a, more, ambitious, centralizing, state, dedicated, to, national, integration, and, national, self, assertion, in, the, assessment, of, historian, alan, knight, a, victory, of, villa, and, zapata, would, probably, have, resulted, in, a, weak, fragmented, state, a, collage, of, revolutionary, fiefs, of, varied, political, hues, presided, over, by, a, feeble, central, government, porfirio, d, az, had, successfully, centralized, power, during, his, long, presidency, carranza, was, an, old,

successive, revolutionary, generals, holding, the, presidency, obreg, n, calles, and, c, rdenas, systematically, downsized, the, army, and, instituted, reforms, to, create, a, professionalized, force, subordinate, to, civilian, politicians, by, 1940, the, government, had, controlled, the, power, of, the, revolutionary, generals, making, the, mexican, military, subordinate, to, the, strong, central, government, breaking, the, cycle, of, military, intervention, in, politics, dating, to, the, independence, era, it, is, also, in, contrast, to, the, pattern, of, military, power, in, many, latin, american, countries, an, important, element, the, revolution, s, legacy, is, the, 1917, constitution, the, document, brought, numerous, reforms, demanded, by, populist, factions, of, the, revolution, with, article, 27, empowering, the, state, to, expropriate, resources, deemed, vital, to, the, nation, these, powers, included, expropriation, of, hacienda, lands, and, redistribution, to, peasants, article, 27, also, empowered, the, government, to, expropriate, holdings, of, foreign, companies, most, prominently, seen, in, the, 1938, expropriation, of, oil, in, article, 123, the, constitution, codified, major, labor, reforms, including, an, 8, hour, workday, a, right, to, strike, equal, pay, laws, for, women, and, an, end, to, exploitative, practices, such, as, child, labor, and, company, stores, the, constitution, strengthened, restrictions, on, the, catholic, church, in, mexico, which, when, enforced, by, the, calles, government, resulted, in, the, cristero, war, and, a, negotiated, settlement, of, the, conflict, the, restrictions, on, the, religion, in, the, constitution, remained, in, place, until, the, early, 1990s, the, salinas, government, introduced, reforms, to, the, constitution, that, rolled, back, the, government, s, power, to, expropriate, property, and, its, restrictions, on, religious, institutions, as, part, of, his, policy, to, join, the, u, s, and, canada, free, trade, agreement, just, as, the, government, of, carlos, salinas, de, gortari, was, amending, significant, provisions, of, the, constitution, metro, constituci, n, de, 1917, station, was, opened, the, creation, of, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, pri, emerged, as, a, way, to, manage, political, power, and, succession, without, resorting, to, violence, it, was, established, in, 1929, by, president, calles, in, the, wake, of, the, assassination, of, president, elect, obreg, n, and, two, rebellions, by, disgruntled, revolutionary, generals, with, presidential, ambitions, initially, calles, remained, the, power, behind, the, presidency, during, a, period, known, as, the, maximato, but, his, hand, picked, presidential, candidate, l, zaro, c, rdenas, won, a, power, struggle, with, calles, expelling, him, from, the, country, c, rdenas, reorganized, the, party, that, calles, founded, creating, formal, sectors, for, interest, groups, including, one, for, the, mexican, military, the, reorganized, party, was, named, party, of, the, mexican, revolution, in, 1946, the, party, again, changed, its, name, to, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, the, party, under, its, various, names, held, the, presidency, uninterruptedly, from, 1929, to, 2000, and, again, from, 2012, to, 2018, under, president, enrique, pe, a, nieto, in, 1988, cuauht, moc, c, rdenas, son, of, president, l, zaro, c, rdenas, broke, with, the, pri, forming, an, independent, leftist, party, the, party, of, the, democratic, revolution, or, prd, it, is, not, by, chance, that, the, party, used, the, word, revolution, in, its, name, challenging, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, s, appropriation, of, the, mexican, revolution, the, pri, was, built, as, a, big, tent, corporatist, party, to, bring, many, political, factions, and, interest, groups, peasantry, labor, urban, professionals, together, while, excluding, conservatives, and, catholics, who, eventually, formed, the, opposition, national, action, party, in, 1939, to, incorporate, the, populace, into, the, party, presidents, calles, and, c, rdenas, created, an, institutional, structure, to, bring, in, popular, agrarian, labor, and, popular, sectors, c, rdenas, reorganized, the, party, in, 1938, controversially, bringing, in, the, military, as, a, sector, his, successor, president, avila, camacho, reorganized, the, party, into, its, final, form, removing, the, military, this, channeled, both, political, patronage, and, limited, political, options, of, those, sectors, this, structure, strengthened, the, power, of, the, pri, and, the, government, union, and, peasant, leaders, themselves, gained, power, of, patronage, and, the, discontent, of, the, membership, was, channeled, through, them, if, organizational, leaders, could, not, resolve, a, situation, or, gain, benefits, for, their, members, it, was, they, who, were, blamed, for, being, ineffective, brokers, there, was, the, appearance, of, union, and, peasant, leagues, power, but, the, effective, power, was, in, the, hands, of, the, pri, under, pri, leadership, before, the, 2000, elections, which, saw, the, conservative, national, action, party, elected, most, power, came, from, a, central, executive, committee, which, budgeted, all, government, projects, this, in, effect, turned, the, legislature, into, a, rubber, stamp, for, the, pri, s, leadership, the, party, s, name, is, aimed, at, expressing, the, mexican, state, s, incorporation, of, the, idea, of, revolution, and, especially, a, continuous, nationalist, anti, imperialist, mexican, revolution, into, political, discourse, and, its, legitimization, as, a, popular, revolutionary, party, according, to, historian, alan, knight, the, memory, of, the, revolution, became, a, sort, of, secular, religion, that, justified, the, party, s, rule, the, mexican, revolution, brought, about, various, social, changes, first, the, leaders, of, the, porfiriato, lost, their, political, power, but, kept, their, economic, power, and, the, middle, class, started, to, enter, the, public, administration, at, this, moment, the, bureaucrat, the, government, officer, the, leader, were, born, the, army, opened, the, sociopolitical, system, and, the, leaders, in, the, constitutionalist, faction, particularly, lvaro, obreg, n, and, plutarco, el, as, calles, controlled, the, central, government, for, more, than, a, decade, after, the, military, phase, ended, in, 1920, the, creation, of, the, pnr, in, 1929, brought, generals, into, the, political, system, but, as, an, institution, the, army, s, power, as, an, interventionist, force, was, tamed, most, directly, under, l, zaro, c, rdenas, who, in, 1936, incorporated, the, army, as, a, sector, in, the, new, iteration, of, the, party, the, revolutionary, party, of, mexico, prm, the, old, federal, army, had, been, destroyed, during, the, revolution, and, the, new, collection, of, revolutionary, fighters, were, brought, under, state, control, although, the, proportion, between, rural, and, urban, population, and, the, number, of, workers, and, the, middle, class, remained, practically, the, same, the, mexican, revolution, brought, substantial, qualitative, changes, to, the, cities, big, rural, landlords, moved, to, the, city, escaping, from, chaos, in, the, rural, areas, some, poor, farmers, also, migrated, to, the, cities, and, they, settled, on, neighborhoods, where, the, porfiriato, elite, used, to, live, the, standard, of, living, in, the, cities, grew, it, went, from, contributing, to, 42, of, the, national, gdp, to, 60, by, 1940, however, social, inequality, remained, the, greatest, change, occurred, among, the, rural, population, the, agrarian, reform, allowed, some, revolutionary, men, to, have, access, to, land, ejidos, that, remained, under, control, of, the, government, however, the, structure, of, land, ownership, for, ejidetarios, did, not, promote, rural, development, and, impoverished, the, rural, population, even, further, from, 1934, to, 1940, wages, fell, 25, on, rural, areas, while, for, city, workers, wages, increased, by, 20, there, was, a, lack, of, food, there, was, not, much, to, sell, and, even, less, to, buy, the, habit, of, sleeping, in, the, floor, remains, diet, is, limited, to, beans, tortilla, and, chili, pepper, clothing, is, poor, peasants, temporarily, migrated, to, other, regions, to, work, in, the, production, of, certain, crops, where, they, were, frequently, exploited, abused, and, suffered, from, various, diseases, others, decided, to, migrate, to, the, united, states, a, modern, legacy, of, revolution, in, the, rural, sphere, is, the, chiapas, insurgency, of, the, 1990s, taking, its, name, from, emiliano, zapata, the, zapatista, army, of, national, liberation, ej, rcito, zapatista, de, liberaci, n, nacional, the, neo, zapatista, revolt, began, in, chiapas, which, was, very, reliant, and, supportive, of, the, revolutionary, reforms, especially, the, ejido, system, which, it, had, pioneered, before, c, rdenas, took, power, most, revolutionary, gains, were, reversed, in, the, early, 1990s, by, president, salinas, who, began, moving, away, from, the, agrarian, policies, of, the, late, post, revolution, period, in, favor, of, modern, capitalism, this, culminated, in, the, dismantling, of, the, ejido, system, in, chiapas, removing, many, landless, peasants, hope, of, achieving, access, to, land, calling, to, mexico, s, revolutionary, heritage, the, ezln, draws, heavily, on, early, revolutionary, rhetoric, it, is, inspired, by, many, of, zapata, s, policies, including, a, call, for, decentralized, local, rule, while, the, war, was, raging, in, mexico, mexicans, and, mexican, americans, living, in, the, united, states, had, a, multitude, of, reaction, and, responses, to, the, war, these, responses, were, not, unified, however, as, class, race, regional, origins, and, political, ideologies, contributed, to, a, large, amount, of, different, reactions, from, the, mexican, diaspora, in, the, united, states, furthermore, not, all, mexicans, had, the, same, citizenship, status, with, some, being, immigrants, refugees, exiles, or, people, whose, family, had, lived, in, the, south, western, states, from, texas, to, california, since, before, the, mexican, american, war, within, mexicans, and, mexican, americans, there, was, a, wide, political, spectrum, present, from, extreme, anarchists, to, conservative, counterrevolutionaries, some, of, these, groups, included, tejano, progressives, who, supported, the, revolution, and, actively, helped, out, by, raising, awareness, to, social, justice, and, border, anarchists, who, were, a, more, radical, group, that, participated, in, violence, the, violence, of, the, revolution, is, a, powerful, memory, mexican, survivors, of, the, revolution, desired, a, lasting, peace, and, were, willing, to, accept, a, level, of, political, deficiencies, to, maintain, peace, and, stability, the, memory, of, the, revolution, was, used, as, justification, for, the, party, s, policies, with,
