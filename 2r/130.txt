century, the, zhou, dynasty, 1046, 256, bc, was, the, earliest, that, could, be, verified, from, its, own, records, however, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, ad, antiquarians, collected, bronze, ritual, vessels, attributed, to, the, shang, era, some, of, which, bore, inscriptions, in, 1899, several, scholars, noticed, that, chinese, pharmacists, were, selling, dragon, bones, marked, with, curious, and, archaic, characters, these, were, finally, traced, back, in, 1928, to, what, is, now, called, yinxu, north, of, the, yellow, river, near, anyang, where, the, academia, sinica, undertook, archaeological, excavation, until, the, second, sino, japanese, war, in, 1937, archaeologists, focused, on, the, yellow, river, valley, in, henan, as, the, most, likely, site, of, the, states, described, in, the, traditional, histories, after, 1950, the, remnants, of, the, earlier, walled, settlement, of, zhengzhou, shang, city, were, discovered, within, the, modern, city, of, zhengzhou, it, has, been, determined, that, the, earth, walls, at, zhengzhou, erected, in, the, 15th, century, bc, would, have, been, 20, m, 66, ft, wide, at, the, base, rising, to, a, height, of, 8, m, 26, ft, and, formed, a, roughly, rectangular, wall, 7, km, 4, mi, around, the, ancient, city, the, rammed, earth, construction, of, these, walls, was, an, inherited, tradition, since, much, older, fortifications, of, this, type, have, been, found, at, chinese, neolithic, sites, of, the, longshan, culture, c, 3000, c, 2000, bc, in, 2022, excavation, of, an, elite, tomb, inside, the, city, walls, yielded, over, 200, artefacts, including, a, gold, face, covering, measuring, 18, 3, by, 14, 5, cm, 7, 2, by, 5, 7, in, in, 1959, the, site, of, the, erlitou, culture, was, found, in, yanshi, south, of, the, yellow, river, near, luoyang, radiocarbon, dating, suggests, that, the, erlitou, culture, flourished, c, 2100, bc, to, 1800, bc, they, built, large, palaces, suggesting, the, existence, of, an, organized, state, in, 1983, yanshi, shang, city, was, discovered, 6, kilometres, 3, 7, mi, north, east, of, the, erlitou, site, in, yanshi, s, shixianggou, township, this, was, a, large, walled, city, dating, from, 1600, bc, it, had, an, area, of, nearly, 200, hectares, 490, acres, and, featured, pottery, characteristic, of, the, erligang, culture, the, remains, of, a, walled, city, of, about, 470, hectares, 1, 200, acres, were, discovered, in, 1999, across, the, huan, river, from, the, well, explored, yinxu, site, the, city, now, known, as, huanbei, was, apparently, occupied, for, less, than, a, century, and, destroyed, shortly, before, the, construction, of, the, yinxu, complex, between, 1989, and, 2000, an, important, shang, settlement, was, excavated, near, xiaoshuangqiao, about, 20, km, northwest, of, zhengzhou, covering, an, intermediary, period, between, the, zhengzhou, site, and, the, late, capitals, on, the, huan, river, it, features, most, prominently, sacrificial, pits, with, articulated, skeletons, of, cattle, a, quintessential, part, of, the, late, shang, ritual, complex, chinese, historians, were, accustomed, to, the, notion, of, one, dynasty, succeeding, another, and, readily, identified, the, erligang, and, erlitou, sites, with, the, early, shang, and, xia, dynasty, of, traditional, histories, the, actual, political, situation, in, early, china, may, have, been, more, complicated, with, the, xia, and, shang, being, political, entities, that, existed, concurrently, just, as, the, early, zhou, who, established, the, successor, state, of, the, shang, are, known, to, have, existed, at, the, same, time, as, the, shang, it, has, also, been, suggested, the, xia, legend, originated, as, a, shang, myth, of, an, earlier, people, who, were, their, opposites, the, erligang, culture, centred, on, the, zhengzhou, site, is, found, across, a, wide, area, of, china, even, as, far, northeast, as, the, area, of, modern, beijing, where, at, least, one, burial, in, this, region, during, this, period, contained, both, erligang, style, bronze, utensils, and, local, style, gold, jewellery, the, discovery, of, a, chenggu, style, dagger, axe, at, xiaohenan, demonstrates, that, even, at, this, early, stage, of, chinese, history, there, were, some, ties, between, the, distant, areas, of, north, china, the, panlongcheng, site, in, the, middle, yangtze, valley, was, an, important, regional, centre, of, the, erligang, culture, accidental, finds, elsewhere, in, china, have, revealed, advanced, civilizations, contemporaneous, with, but, culturally, unlike, the, settlement, at, anyang, such, as, the, walled, city, of, sanxingdui, in, sichuan, western, scholars, are, hesitant, to, designate, such, settlements, as, belonging, to, the, shang, also, unlike, the, shang, there, is, no, known, evidence, that, the, sanxingdui, culture, had, a, system, of, writing, the, late, shang, state, at, anyang, is, thus, generally, considered, the, first, verifiable, civilization, in, chinese, history, in, contrast, the, earliest, layers, of, the, wucheng, culture, predating, anyang, have, yielded, pottery, fragments, containing, short, sequences, of, symbols, suggesting, that, they, may, be, a, form, of, writing, quite, different, in, form, from, oracle, bone, characters, but, the, sample, is, too, small, for, decipherment, a, study, of, mitochondrial, dna, from, yinxu, commoner, graves, showed, similarity, with, modern, northern, han, chinese, but, significant, differences, from, southern, han, chinese, the, earliest, securely, dated, event, in, chinese, history, is, the, start, of, the, gonghe, regency, in, 841, bc, early, in, the, zhou, dynasty, a, date, first, established, by, sima, qian, attempts, to, establish, earlier, dates, have, been, plagued, by, doubts, about, the, origin, and, transmission, of, traditional, texts, and, the, difficulties, in, their, interpretation, more, recent, attempts, have, compared, the, traditional, histories, with, archaeological, and, astronomical, data, at, least, 44, dates, for, the, end, of, the, dynasty, have, been, proposed, ranging, from, 1130, to, 1018, bc, the, oldest, extant, direct, records, date, from, approximately, 1250, bc, at, anyang, covering, the, reigns, of, the, last, nine, shang, kings, the, shang, had, a, fully, developed, system, of, writing, preserved, on, bronze, inscriptions, and, a, small, number, of, other, writings, on, pottery, jade, and, other, stones, horn, etc, but, most, prolifically, on, oracle, bones, the, complexity, and, sophistication, of, this, writing, system, indicates, an, earlier, period, of, development, but, direct, evidence, of, such, is, still, lacking, other, advances, included, the, invention, of, many, musical, instruments, and, celestial, observations, of, mars, and, various, comets, by, shang, astronomers, their, civilization, was, based, on, agriculture, and, augmented, by, hunting, and, animal, husbandry, in, addition, to, war, the, shang, also, practised, human, sacrifice, skulls, of, sacrificial, victims, have, been, found, to, be, similar, to, modern, chinese, ones, based, on, comparisons, with, remains, from, hainan, and, taiwan, cowry, shells, were, also, excavated, at, anyang, suggesting, trade, with, coast, dwellers, but, there, was, very, limited, sea, trade, since, china, was, isolated, from, other, large, civilizations, during, the, shang, period, trade, relations, and, diplomatic, ties, with, other, formidable, powers, via, the, silk, road, and, chinese, voyages, to, the, indian, ocean, did, not, exist, until, the, reign, of, emperor, wu, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 221, ad, at, the, excavated, royal, palace, in, yinxu, large, stone, pillar, bases, were, found, along, with, rammed, earth, foundations, and, platforms, which, according, to, fairbank, were, as, hard, as, cement, these, foundations, in, turn, originally, supported, 53, buildings, of, wooden, post, and, beam, construction, in, close, proximity, to, the, main, palatial, complex, there, were, underground, pits, used, for, storage, servants, quarters, and, housing, quarters, many, shang, royal, tombs, had, been, tunnelled, into, and, ravaged, by, grave, robbers, in, ancient, times, but, in, the, spring, of, 1976, the, discovery, of, tomb, 5, at, yinxu, revealed, a, tomb, that, was, not, only, undisturbed, but, one, of, the, most, richly, furnished, shang, tombs, that, archaeologists, had, yet, come, across, with, over, 200, bronze, ritual, vessels, and, 109, inscriptions, of, fu, hao, s, name, zheng, zhenxiang, and, other, archaeologists, realized, they, had, stumbled, across, the, tomb, of, fu, hao, wu, ding, s, most, famous, consort, also, renowned, as, a, military, general, and, mentioned, in, 170, to, 180, oracle, bone, inscriptions, along, with, bronze, vessels, stoneware, and, pottery, vessels, bronze, weapons, jade, figures, and, hair, combs, and, bone, hairpins, were, found, the, archaeological, team, argue, that, the, large, assortment, of, weapons, and, ritual, vessels, in, her, tomb, correlate, with, the, oracle, bone, accounts, of, her, military, and, ritual, activities, the, capital, was, the, centre, of, court, life, over, time, court, rituals, to, appease, spirits, developed, and, in, addition, to, his, secular, duties, the, king, would, serve, as, the, head, of, the, ancestor, worship, cult, often, the, king, would, even, perform, oracle, bone, divinations, himself, especially, near, the, end, of, the, dynasty, evidence, from, excavations, of, the, royal, tombs, indicates, that, royalty, were, buried, with, articles, of, value, presumably, for, use, in, the, afterlife, perhaps, for, the, same, reason, hundreds, of, commoners, who, may, have, been, slaves, were, buried, alive, with, the, royal, corpse, a, line, of, hereditary, shang, kings, ruled, over, much, of, northern, china, and, shang, troops, fought, frequent, wars, with, neighbouring, settlements, and, nomadic, herdsmen, from, the, inner, asian, steppes, the, shang, king, in, his, oracular, divinations, repeatedly, showed, concern, about, the, barbarians, living, outside, of, the, civilized, regions, which, made, up, the, centre, of, shang, territory, in, particular, the, group, living, in, the, yan, mountains, were, regularly, mentioned, as, hostile, to, the, shang, apart, from, their, role, as, the, head, military, commanders, shang, kings, also, asserted, their, social, supremacy, by, acting, as, the, high, priests, of, society, and, leading, the, divination, ceremonies, as, the, oracle, bone, texts, reveal, the, shang, kings, were, viewed, as, the, best, qualified, members, of, society, to, offer, sacrifices, to, their, royal, ancestors, and, to, the, high, god, di, who, in, their, beliefs, was, responsible, for, the, rain, wind, and, thunder, the, king, appointed, officials, to, manage, certain, activities, usually, in, a, specified, region, these, included, agricultural, official, pastors, dog, officers, and, guards, these, officers, led, their, own, retinues, in, the, conduct, of, their, duties, and, some, grew, more, independent, and, emerged, as, rulers, of, their, own, there, was, a, basic, system, of, bureaucracy, in, place, with, references, to, positions, such, as, the, many, dog, officers, many, horse, officers, the, many, artisans, the, many, archers, or, court, titles, like, junior, servitor, for, cultivation, or, junior, servitor, for, labourers, members, of, the, royal, family, would, be, assigned, personal, estates, the, king, provided, them, with, pre, determined, public, works, such, as, walling, cities, in, their, regions, distributed, materials, and, issued, commands, to, them, in, turn, their, estates, belonged, ultimately, to, the, king, s, land, and, they, paid, tribute, to, the, king, as, well, as, reporting, to, him, about, conquered, lands, more, distant, rulers, were, known, as, marquess, or, count, who, sometimes, provided, tribute, and, support, to, the, shang, king, in, exchange, for, military, aid, and, augury, services, however, these, alliances, were, unstable, as, indicated, by, the, frequent, royal, divinations, about, the, sustainability, of, such, relations, the, existence, of, records, regarding, enemy, kills, prisoners, and, booty, taken, point, to, the, existence, of, a, proto, bureaucracy, of, written, documents, shang, religious, rituals, featured, divination, and, sacrifice, the, degree, to, which, shamanism, was, a, central, aspect, of, shang, religion, is, a, subject, of, debate, there, were, six, main, recipients, of, sacrifice, the, shang, believed, that, their, ancestors, held, power, over, them, and, performed, divination, rituals, to, secure, their, approval, for, planned, actions, divination, involved, cracking, a, turtle, carapace, or, ox, scapula, to, answer, a, question, and, to, then, record, the, response, to, that, question, on, the, bone, itself, it, is, unknown, what, criteria, the, diviners, used, to, determine, the, response, but, it, is, believed, to, be, the, sound, or, pattern, of, the, cracks, on, the, bone, the, shang, also, seem, to, have, believed, in, an, afterlife, as, evidenced, by, the, elaborate, burial, tombs, built, for, deceased, rulers, often, carriages, utensils, sacrificial, vessels, weapons, would, be, included, in, the, tomb, a, king, s, burial, involved, the, burial, of, up, to, a, few, hundred, humans, and, horses, as, well, to, accompany, the, king, into, the, afterlife, in, some, cases, even, numbering, four, hundred, finally, tombs, included, ornaments, such, as, jade, which, the, shang, may, have, believed, to, protect, against, decay, or, confer, immortality, the, shang, religion, was, highly, bureaucratic, and, meticulously, ordered, oracle, bones, contained, descriptions, of, the, date, ritual, person, ancestor, and, questions, associated, with, the, divination, tombs, displayed, highly, ordered, arrangements, of, bones, with, groups, of, skeletons, laid, out, facing, the, same, direction, chinese, bronze, casting, and, pottery, advanced, during, the, shang, with, bronze, typically, being, used, for, ritually, significant, rather, than, primarily, utilitarian, items, as, early, as, c, 1500, bc, the, early, shang, dynasty, engaged, in, large, scale, production, of, bronzeware, vessels, and, weapons, this, production, required, a, large, labour, force, that, could, handle, the, mining, refining, and, transportation, of, the, necessary, copper, tin, and, lead, ores, this, in, turn, created, a, need, for, official, managers, that, could, oversee, both, labourers, and, skilled, artisans, and, craftsmen, the, shang, royal, court, and, aristocrats, required, a, vast, number, of, different, bronze, vessels, for, various, ceremonial, purposes, and, events, of, religious, divination, ceremonial, rules, even, decreed, how, many, bronze, containers, of, each, type, a, noble, of, a, certain, rank, could, own, with, the, increased, amount, of, bronze, available, the, army, could, also, better, equip, itself, with, an, assortment, of, bronze, weaponry, bronze, was, also, used, for, the, fittings, of, spoke, wheeled, chariots, which, appeared, in, china, around, 1200, bc, the, shang, dynasty, entered, into, prolonged, conflicts, with, northern, frontier, tribes, called, the, guifang, bronze, weapons, were, an, integral, part, of, shang, society, shang, infantry, were, armed, with, a, variety, of, stone, and, bronze, weaponry, including, spears, pole, axes, pole, based, dagger, axes, composite, bows, and, bronze, or, leather, helmets, although, the, shang, depended, upon, the, military, skills, of, their, nobility, shang, rulers, could, mobilize, the, masses, of, town, dwelling, and, rural, commoners, as, conscript, labourers, and, soldiers, for, both, campaigns, of, defence, and, conquest, aristocrats, and, other, state, rulers, were, obligated, to, furnish, their, local, garrisons, with, all, necessary, equipment, armour, and, armaments, the, shang, king, maintained, a, force, of, about, a, thousand, troops, at, his, capital, and, would, personally, lead, this, force, into, battle, a, rudimentary, military, bureaucracy, was, also, needed, in, order, to, muster, forces, ranging, from, three, to, five, thousand, troops, for, border, campaigns, to, thirteen, thousand, troops, for, suppressing, rebellions, the, earliest, records, are, the, oracle, bones, inscribed, during, the, reigns, of, the, shang, kings, from, wu, ding, the, oracle, bones, do, not, contain, king, lists, but, they, do, record, the, sacrifices, to, previous, kings, and, the, ancestors, of, the, current, king, which, follow, a, standard, schedule, that, scholars, have, reconstructed, from, this, evidence, scholars, have, assembled, the, implied, king, list, and, genealogy,
