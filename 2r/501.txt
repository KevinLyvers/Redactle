village, this, incident, marked, the, first, time, the, boxers, used, the, slogan, support, the, qing, destroy, the, foreigners, fu, qing, mie, yang, that, later, characterised, them, the, boxers, called, themselves, the, militia, united, in, righteousness, for, the, first, time, in, october, 1899, at, the, battle, of, senluo, temple, a, clash, between, boxers, and, qing, government, troops, by, using, the, word, militia, rather, than, boxers, they, distanced, themselves, from, forbidden, martial, arts, sects, and, tried, to, give, their, movement, the, legitimacy, of, a, group, that, defended, orthodoxy, violence, toward, missionaries, and, christians, drew, sharp, responses, from, diplomats, protecting, their, nationals, including, western, seizure, of, harbors, and, forts, and, the, moving, in, of, troops, in, preparation, for, all, out, war, as, well, as, taking, control, of, more, land, by, force, or, by, coerced, long, term, leases, from, the, qing, in, 1899, the, french,

their, people, in, legal, or, family, disputes, and, bypass, the, local, officials, after, the, german, government, took, over, shandong, many, chinese, feared, that, the, foreign, missionaries, and, possibly, all, christian, activities, were, imperialist, attempts, at, carving, the, melon, i, e, to, colonise, china, piece, by, piece, a, chinese, official, expressed, the, animosity, towards, foreigners, succinctly, take, away, your, missionaries, and, your, opium, and, you, will, be, welcome, in, 1899, the, boxer, rebellion, developed, into, a, mass, movement, the, previous, year, the, hundred, days, reform, in, which, progressive, chinese, reformers, persuaded, the, guangxu, emperor, to, engage, in, modernizing, efforts, was, suppressed, by, empress, dowager, cixi, and, yuan, shikai, the, qing, political, elite, struggled, with, the, question, of, how, to, retain, its, power, the, qing, government, came, to, view, the, boxers, as, a, means, to, help, oppose, foreign, powers, the, national, crisis, was, widely, perceived, as, caused, by, foreign, aggression, inside, even, though, afterwards, a, majority, of, chinese, were, grateful, for, the, actions, of, the, alliance, the, qing, government, was, corrupt, common, people, often, faced, extortions, from, government, officials, and, the, government, offered, no, protection, from, the, violent, actions, of, the, boxers, the, military, of, the, qing, dynasty, had, been, dealt, a, severe, blow, by, the, first, sino, japanese, war, and, this, had, prompted, military, reform, that, was, still, in, its, early, stages, when, the, boxer, rebellion, occurred, and, they, were, expected, to, fight, the, bulk, of, the, fighting, was, conducted, by, the, forces, already, around, zhili, with, troops, from, other, provinces, only, arriving, after, the, main, fighting, had, ended, war, revenue, field, troops, only, staff, field, troops, only, zhili, alone, zhili, alone, the, failure, of, the, qing, forces, to, withstand, the, allied, forces, was, not, surprising, given, the, limited, time, for, reform, and, the, fact, that, the, best, troops, of, china, were, not, committed, to, the, fight, remaining, instead, in, huguang, and, shandong, the, officer, corps, was, particularly, deficient, many, lacked, basic, knowledge, of, strategy, and, tactics, and, even, those, with, training, had, not, actively, commanded, troops, in, the, field, in, addition, the, regular, soldiers, were, noted, for, their, poor, marksmanship, and, inaccuracy, while, cavalry, was, ill, organised, and, was, not, used, to, its, full, extent, tactically, the, chinese, still, retained, their, belief, in, the, superiority, of, defence, often, withdrawing, as, soon, as, they, were, flanked, a, tendency, attributable, to, their, lack, of, combat, experience, and, training, as, well, as, a, lack, of, initiative, from, commanders, who, would, rather, retreat, than, counterattack, however, accusations, of, cowardice, were, minimal, this, was, a, marked, improvement, from, the, sino, japanese, war, of, 1894, 1895, as, chinese, troops, did, not, flee, en, masse, as, before, if, led, by, courageous, officers, the, troops, would, often, fight, to, the, death, as, occurred, under, nie, shicheng, and, ma, yukun, on, the, other, hand, chinese, artillery, was, well, regarded, and, caused, far, more, casualties, than, the, infantry, at, tientsin, and, proving, themselves, superior, to, allied, artillery, in, counter, battery, fire, the, infantry, for, their, part, were, commended, for, their, good, usage, of, cover, and, concealment, in, addition, to, their, tenacity, in, resistance, the, boxers, also, targeted, jewish, groups, in, the, region, destroying, their, reputation, and, leading, to, britain, temporarily, vacating, their, civilian, workers, from, the, front, lines, in, january, 1900, with, a, majority, of, conservatives, in, the, imperial, court, cixi, changed, her, position, on, the, boxers, and, issued, edicts, in, their, defence, causing, protests, from, foreign, powers, cixi, urged, provincial, authorities, to, support, the, boxers, although, few, did, so, in, spring,

19th, century, military, force, committed, without, congressional, authorisation, had, been, typically, used, against, nongovernmental, organisations, now, it, was, beginning, to, be, used, against, sovereign, states, and, in, the, case, of, theodore, roosevelt, with, less, consultation, than, ever, from, the, beginning, views, differed, as, to, whether, the, boxers, were, better, seen, as, anti, imperialist, patriotic, and, proto, nationalist, or, as, backward, irrational, and, futile, opponents, of, what, was, inevitable, change, the, historian, joseph, w, esherick, comments, that, confusion, about, the, boxer, uprising, is, not, simply, a, matter, of, popular, misconceptions, since, there, is, no, major, incident, in, china, s, modern, history, on, which, the, range, of, professional, interpretation, is, as, great, the, boxers, drew, condemnation, from, those, who, wanted, to, modernise, china, according, to, a, western, model, of, civilisation, sun, yat, sen, considered, the, founding, father, of, modern, china, at, the, time, worked, to, overthrow, the, qing, but, believed, that, government, spread, rumours, that, caused, confusion, among, the, populace, and, stirred, up, the, boxer, movement, he, delivered, scathing, criticism, of, the, boxers, anti, foreignism, and, obscurantism, sun, praised, the, boxers, for, their, spirit, of, resistance, but, called, them, bandits, students, studying, in, japan, were, ambivalent, some, stated, that, while, the, uprising, originated, from, the, ignorant, and, stubborn, people, their, beliefs, were, brave, and, righteous, and, could, be, transformed, into, a, force, for, independence, after, the, fall, of, the, qing, dynasty, in, 1911, nationalistic, chinese, became, more, sympathetic, to, the, boxers, in, 1918, sun, praised, their, fighting, spirit, and, said, that, the, boxers, were, courageous, and, fearless, in, fighting, to, the, death, against, the, alliance, armies, specifically, the, battle, of, yangcun, chinese, liberals, such, as, hu, shih, who, called, on, china, to, modernise, still, condemned, the, boxers, for, their, irrationality, and, barbarity, the, leader, of, the, new, culture, movement, chen, duxiu, forgave, the, barbarism, of, the, boxer, given, the, crime, foreigners, committed, in, china, and, contended, that, it, was, those, subservient, to, the, foreigners, that, truly, deserved, our, resentment, in, other, countries, views, of, the, boxers, were, complex, and, contentious, mark, twain, said, that, the, boxer, is, a, patriot, he, loves, his, country, better, than, he, does, the, countries, of, other, people, i, wish, him, success, the, russian, writer, leo, tolstoy, also, praised, the, boxers, and, accused, nicholas, ii, of, russia, and, wilhelm, ii, of, germany, of, being, chiefly, responsible, for, the, lootings, rapes, murders, and, christian, brutality, of, the, russian, and, western, troops, the, russian, revolutionary, vladimir, lenin, mocked, the, russian, government, s, claim, that, it, was, protecting, christian, civilisation, poor, imperial, government, so, christianly, unselfish, and, yet, so, unjustly, maligned, several, years, ago, it, unselfishly, seized, port, arthur, and, now, it, is, unselfishly, seizing, manchuria, it, has, unselfishly, flooded, the, frontier, provinces, of, china, with, hordes, of, contractors, engineers, and, officers, who, by, their, conduct, have, roused, to, indignation, even, the, chinese, known, for, their, docility, the, russian, newspaper, amurskii, krai, criticised, the, killing, of, innocent, civilians, and, charged, that, restraint, would, have, been, more, becoming, of, a, civilized, christian, nation, asking, what, shall, we, tell, civilized, people, we, shall, have, to, say, to, them, do, not, consider, us, as, brothers, anymore, we, are, mean, and, terrible, people, we, have, killed, those, who, hid, at, our, place, who, sought, our, protection, he, also, saw, the, boxer, rebellion, as, one, of, the, first, tries, of, the, working, class, and, a, chinese, proletariat, to, overthrow, the, foreign, imperialistic, oppressors, and, saw, them, as, one, of, the, avant, garde, proletarian, forces, in, fighting, for, their, freedom, against, imperialism, like, it, was, viewed, by, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, some, american, churchmen, spoke, out, in, support, of, the, boxers, in, 1912, the, evangelist, george, f, pentecost, said, that, the, boxer, uprising, was, a, patriotic, movement, to, expel, the, foreign, devils, just, that, the, foreign, devils, suppose, he, said, the, great, nations, of, europe, were, to, put, their, fleets, together, came, over, here, seize, portland, move, on, down, to, boston, then, new, york, then, philadelphia, and, so, on, down, the, atlantic, coast, and, around, the, gulf, of, galveston, suppose, they, took, possession, of, these, port, cities, drove, our, people, into, the, hinterland, built, great, warehouses, and, factories, brought, in, a, body, of, dissolute, agents, and, calmly, notified, our, people, that, henceforward, they, would, manage, the, commerce, of, the, country, would, we, not, have, a, boxer, movement, to, drive, those, foreign, european, christian, devils, out, of, our, country, the, indian, bengali, rabindranath, tagore, attacked, the, european, colonialists, a, number, of, indian, soldiers, in, the, british, indian, army, sympathised, with, the, cause, of, the, boxers, and, in, 1994, the, indian, military, returned, a, bell, looted, by, british, soldiers, in, the, temple, of, heaven, to, china, the, events, also, left, a, longer, impact, historian, robert, bickers, noted, that, the, boxer, rebellion, served, as, an, equivalent, to, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, for, the, british, government, and, agitated, the, yellow, peril, among, the, british, public, he, adds, that, later, events, like, the, northern, expedition, during, the, 1920s, and, even, the, activities, of, the, red, guards, during, the, 1960s, were, perceived, as, standing, in, the, shadow, of, the, boxers, history, textbooks, in, taiwan, and, hong, kong, often, present, the, boxer, as, irrational, but, the, central, government, textbooks, in, mainland, china, have, described, the, boxer, movement, as, an, anti, imperialist, patriotic, peasant, movement, that, failed, by, the, lack, of, leadership, from, the, modern, working, class, and, the, international, army, as, an, invading, force, in, recent, decades, however, large, scale, projects, of, village, interviews, and, explorations, of, archival, sources, have, led, historians, in, china, to, take, a, more, nuanced, view, some, non, chinese, scholars, such, as, joseph, esherick, have, seen, the, movement, as, anti, imperialist, but, others, hold, that, the, concept, nationalistic, is, anachronistic, because, the, chinese, nation, had, not, been, formed, and, the, boxers, were, more, concerned, with, regional, issues, paul, cohen, s, recent, study, includes, a, survey, of, the, boxers, as, myth, which, shows, how, their, memory, was, used, in, changing, ways, in, 20th, century, china, from, the, new, culture, movement, to, the, cultural, revolution, in, recent, years, the, boxer, question, has, been, debated, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1998, the, critical, scholar, wang, yi, argued, that, the, boxers, had, features, in, common, with, the, extremism, of, the, cultural, revolution, both, events, had, the, external, goal, of, liquidating, all, harmful, pests, and, the, domestic, goal, of, eliminating, bad, elements, of, all, descriptions, and, that, the, relation, was, rooted, in, cultural, obscurantism, wang, explained, to, his, readers, the, changes, in, attitudes, towards, the, boxers, from, the, condemnation, of, the, may, fourth, movement, to, the, approval, expressed, by, mao, zedong, during, the, cultural, revolution, in, 2006, yuan, weishi, a, professor, of, philosophy, at, zhongshan, university, in, guangzhou, wrote, that, the, boxers, by, their, criminal, actions, brought, unspeakable, suffering, to, the, nation, and, its, people, these, are, all, facts, that, everybody, knows, and, it, is, a, national, shame, that, the, chinese, people, cannot, forget, yuan, charged, that, history, textbooks, had, been, lacking, in, neutrality, by, presenting, the, boxer, uprising, as, a, magnificent, feat, of, patriotism, and, not, the, view, that, most, boxer, rebels, were, violent, in, response, some, labelled, yuan, weishi, a, traitor, hanjian, the, name, boxer, rebellion, concludes, joseph, w, esherick, a, contemporary, historian, is, truly, a, misnomer, for, the, boxers, never, rebelled, against, the, manchu, rulers, of, china, and, their, qing, dynasty, and, the, most, common, boxer, slogan, throughout, the, history, of, the, movement, was, support, the, qing, destroy, the, foreign, where, foreign, clearly, meant, the, foreign, religion, christianity, and, its, chinese, converts, as, much, as, the, foreigners, themselves, he, adds, that, only, after, the, movement, was, suppressed, by, the, allied, intervention, did, the, foreign, powers, and, influential, chinese, officials, both, realise, that, the, qing, would, have, to, remain, as, the, government, of, china, to, maintain, order, and, collect, taxes, to, pay, the, indemnity, therefore, to, save, face, for, the, empress, dowager, and, the, members, of, the, imperial, court, all, argued, that, the, boxers, were, rebels, and, that, the, only, support, which, the, boxers, received, from, the, imperial, court, came, from, a, few, manchu, princes, esherick, concludes, that, the, origin, of, the, term, rebellion, was, purely, political, and, opportunistic, but, it, has, had, a, remarkable, staying, power, particularly, in, popular, accounts, on, 6, june, 1900, the, times, of, london, used, the, term, rebellion, in, quotation, marks, presumably, to, indicate, its, view, that, the, rising, was, actually, instigated, by, empress, dowager, cixi, the, historian, lanxin, xiang, refers, to, the, uprising, as, the, so, called, boxer, rebellion, and, he, also, states, that, while, peasant, rebellion, was, nothing, new, in, chinese, history, a, war, against, the, world, s, most, powerful, states, was, other, recent, western, works, refer, to, the, uprising, as, the, boxer, movement, the, boxer, war, or, the, yihetuan, movement, while, chinese, studies, refer, to, it, as, the, yihetuan, yundong, that, is, the, yihetuan, movement, in, his, discussion, of, the, general, and, legal, implications, of, the, terminology, involved, the, german, scholar, thoralf, klein, notes, that, all, of, the, terms, including, the, chinese, terms, are, posthumous, interpretations, of, the, conflict, he, argues, that, each, term, whether, it, be, uprising, rebellion, or, movement, implies, a, different, definition, of, the, conflict, even, the, term, boxer, war, which, has, frequently, been, used, by, scholars, in, the, west, raises, questions, neither, side, made, a, formal, declaration, of, war, the, imperial, edicts, on, june, 21, said, that, hostilities, had, begun, and, directed, the, regular, chinese, army, to, join, the, boxers, against, the, allied, armies, this, was, a, de, facto, declaration, of, war, the, allied, troops, behaved, like, soldiers, who, were, mounting, a, punitive, expedition, in, colonial, style, rather, than, soldiers, who, were, waging, a, declared, war, with, legal, constraints, the, allies, took, advantage, of, the, fact, that, china, had, not, signed, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, on, land, a, key, document, signed, at, the, 1899, hague, peace, conference, they, argued, that, china, had, violated, provisions, that, they, themselves, ignored, there, is, also, a, difference, in, terms, referring, to, the, combatants, the, first, reports, which, came, from, china, in, 1898, referred, to, the, village, activists, as, the, yihequan, wade, giles, i, ho, ch, uan, the, earliest, use, of, the, term, boxer, is, contained, in, a, letter, which, was, written, in, shandong, in, september, 1899, by, missionary, grace, newton, the, context, of, the, letter, makes, it, clear, that, when, it, was, written, boxer, was, already, a, well, known, term, probably, coined, by, arthur, henderson, smith, or, henry, porter, two, missionaries, who, were, also, residing, in, shandong, smith, wrote, in, his, 1902, book, that, the, name, i, ho, ch, an, literally, denotes, the, fists, ch, an, of, righteousness, or, public, i, harmony, ho, in, apparent, allusion, to, the, strength, of, the, united, force, which, was, to, be, put, forth, as, the, chinese, phrase, fists, and, feet, signifies, boxing, and, wrestling, there, appeared, to, be, no, more, suitable, term, for, the, adherents, of, the, sect, than, boxers, a, designation, first, used, by, one, or, two, missionary, correspondents, of, foreign, journals, in, china, and, later, universally, accepted, on, account, of, the, difficulty, of, coining, a, better, one, by, 1900, many, new, forms, of, media, had, matured, including,
