commonwealth, certain, territorial, concessions, but, preserved, russia, s, independence, the, war, was, the, first, major, sign, of, the, rivalry, and, uneasy, relations, between, poland, and, russia, which, last, to, this, day, its, aftermath, had, a, long, lasting, impact, on, russian, society, creating, the, negative, stereotype, of, poland, in, russia, and, most, notably, giving, rise, to, the, romanov, dynasty, which, ruled, russia, for, three, centuries, until, the, february, revolution, in, 1917, it, also, left, a, noticeable, mark, on, russian, culture, with, renowned, writers, and, composers, portraying, the, war, in, works, such, as, the, play, boris, godunov, by, alexander, pushkin, adapted, into, an, opera, by, modest, mussorgsky, a, life, for, the, tsar, by, mikhail, glinka, pan, voyevoda, by, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, as, well, as, films, minin, and, pozharsky, and, 1612, in, polish, historiography, two, military, interventions, immediately, preceding, the, war, the, aim, of, which, was, to, place, a, tsar, loyal, to, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, on, the, russian, throne, are, called, the, dimitriads, and, are, considered, a, separate, conflict, the, first, dymitriad, 1604, 1606, and, second, dymitriad, 1607, 1609, the, polish, russian, war, 1609, 1618, can, subsequently, be, divided, into, two, wars, of, 1609, 1611, and, 1617, 1618, and, may, or, may, not, include, the, 1617, 1618, campaign, which, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, chodkiewicz, campaign, according, to, russian, historiography, the, chaotic, events, of, the, war, fall, into, the, time, of, troubles, the, conflict, with, poles, is, commonly, called, the, polish, invasion, polish, intervention, or, more, specifically, the, polish, intervention, of, the, early, seventeenth, century, in, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, russia, was, in, a, state, of, political, and, economic, crisis, after, the, death, of, tsar, ivan, iv, the, terrible, in, 1584, and, the, death, of, his, son, dimitri, in, 1591, several, factions, competed, for, the, tsar, s, throne, in, 1598, boris, godunov, was, crowned, to, the, russian, throne, marking, the, end, of, the, centuries, long, rule, of, the, rurik, dynasty, while, his, policies, were, rather, moderate, and, well, intentioned, his, rule, was, marred, by, the, general, perception, of, its, questionable, legitimacy, and, allegations, of, his, involvement, in, orchestrating, the, assassination, of, dimitri, while, godunov, managed, to, put, the, opposition, to, his, rule, under, control, he, did, not, manage, to, crush, it, completely, to, add, to, his, troubles, the, first, years, of, the, 17th, century, were, exceptionally, cold, the, drop, in, temperature, was, felt, all, over, the, world, and, was, most, likely, caused, by, a, severe, eruption, of, a, volcano, in, south, america, in, russia, it, resulted, in, a, great, famine, that, swept, through, the, country, from, 1601, to, 1603, in, late, 1600, a, polish, diplomatic, mission, led, by, chancellor, lew, sapieha, with, eliasz, pielgrzymowski, and, stanis, aw, warszycki, arrived, in, moscow, and, proposed, an, alliance, between, the, commonwealth, and, russia, which, would, include, a, future, personal, union, they, proposed, that, after, one, monarch, s, death, without, heirs, the, other, would, become, the, ruler, of, both, countries, however, tsar, godunov, declined, the, union, proposal, and, settled, on, extending, the, treaty, of, jam, zapolski, which, ended, the, lithuanian, wars, of, the, 16th, century, by, 22, years, to, 1622, sigismund, and, the, commonwealth, magnates, knew, full, well, that, they, were, not, capable, of, any, serious, invasion, of, russia, the, commonwealth, army, was, too, small, its, treasury, always, empty, and, the, war, lacked, popular, support, however, as, the, situation, in, russia, deteriorated, sigismund, and, many, commonwealth, magnates, especially, those, with, estates, and, forces, near, the, russian, border, began, to, look, for, a, way, to, profit, from, the, chaos, and, weakness, of, their, eastern, neighbour, this, proved, easy, as, in, the, meantime, many, russian, boyars, disgruntled, by, the, ongoing, civil, war, tried, to, entice, various, neighbors, including, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, into, intervening, some, of, them, looked, to, their, own, profits, trying, to, organize, support, for, their, own, ascension, to, the, russian, throne, others, looked, to, their, western, neighbor, the, commonwealth, and, its, attractive, golden, freedoms, and, together, with, some, polish, politicians, planned, for, some, kind, of, union, between, those, two, states, yet, others, tried, to, tie, their, fates, with, that, of, sweden, in, what, became, known, as, the, de, la, gardie, campaign, and, the, ingrian, war, advocates, for, a, union, of, poland, lithuania, with, russia, proposed, a, plan, similar, to, the, original, polish, lithuanian, union, of, lublin, involving, a, common, foreign, policy, and, military, the, right, for, nobility, to, choose, the, place, where, they, would, live, and, to, buy, landed, estates, removal, of, barriers, for, trade, and, transit, introduction, of, a, single, currency, increased, religious, tolerance, in, russia, especially, the, right, to, build, churches, of, non, orthodox, faiths, and, the, sending, of, boyar, children, for, education, in, more, developed, polish, academies, like, the, jagiellonian, university, however, this, project, never, gained, much, support, many, boyars, feared, that, the, union, with, the, predominantly, catholic, kingdom, of, poland, and, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, would, endanger, russia, s, orthodox, traditions, and, opposed, anything, that, threatened, russian, culture, especially, the, policies, aimed, at, curtailing, the, influence, of, the, orthodox, church, intermarriage, and, education, in, polish, schools, that, had, already, led, to, successful, polonization, of, the, ruthenian, lands, under, polish, control, for, most, of, the, 17th, century, sigismund, iii, was, occupied, with, internal, problems, of, his, own, like, the, nobles, rebellion, in, the, commonwealth, and, the, wars, with, sweden, and, in, moldavia, however, the, impostor, false, dmitry, i, appeared, in, poland, in, 1603, and, soon, found, enough, support, among, powerful, magnates, such, as, micha, wi, niowiecki, lew, and, jan, piotr, sapieha, who, provided, him, with, funds, for, a, campaign, against, godunov, commonwealth, magnates, looked, forward, to, material, gains, from, the, campaign, and, control, over, russia, through, false, dmitriy, in, addition, both, polish, magnates, and, russian, boyars, advanced, plans, for, a, union, between, the, commonwealth, and, russia, similar, to, the, one, lew, sapieha, had, discussed, in, 1600, when, the, idea, had, been, dismissed, by, godunov, finally, the, proponents, of, catholicism, saw, in, dmitry, a, tool, to, spread, the, influence, of, their, church, eastwards, and, after, promises, of, a, united, catholic, dominated, russo, polish, entity, waging, a, war, on, the, ottoman, empire, jesuits, also, provided, him, with, funds, and, education, although, sigismund, declined, to, support, dmitry, officially, with, the, full, might, of, the, commonwealth, the, polish, king, was, always, happy, to, support, pro, catholic, initiatives, and, provided, him, with, the, sum, of, 4, 000, zlotys, enough, for, a, few, hundred, soldiers, nonetheless, some, of, dmitriy, s, supporters, especially, among, those, involved, in, the, rebellion, actively, worked, to, have, dmitry, replace, sigismund, in, exchange, in, june, 1604, dmitry, promised, the, commonwealth, half, of, smolensk, territory, many, were, skeptical, about, the, future, of, this, endeavor, jan, zamoyski, opposed, to, most, of, sigismund, s, policies, later, referred, to, the, entire, false, dmitry, i, affair, as, a, comedy, worthy, of, plautus, or, terentius, when, boris, godunov, heard, about, the, pretender, he, claimed, that, the, man, was, just, a, runaway, monk, called, grigory, otrepyev, although, on, what, information, he, based, this, claim, is, unclear, godunov, s, support, among, the, russians, began, to, wane, especially, when, he, tried, to, spread, counter, rumors, some, of, the, russian, boyars, also, claimed, to, accept, dmitry, as, such, support, gave, them, legitimate, reasons, not, to, pay, taxes, to, godunov, dmitry, attracted, a, number, of, followers, formed, a, small, army, and, supported, by, approximately, 3500, soldiers, of, the, commonwealth, magnates, private, armies, and, the, mercenaries, bought, by, dmitriy, s, own, cash, rode, to, russia, in, june, 1604, some, of, godunov, s, other, enemies, including, approximately, 2, 000, southern, cossacks, joined, dimitry, s, forces, on, his, way, to, moscow, dmitriy, s, forces, fought, two, engagements, with, reluctant, russian, soldiers, his, army, won, the, first, at, novhorod, siverskyi, soon, capturing, chernigov, putivl, sevsk, and, kursk, but, badly, lost, the, second, battle, of, dobrynichi, and, nearly, disintegrated, dmitry, s, cause, was, only, saved, by, the, news, of, the, death, of, tsar, boris, godunov, the, sudden, death, of, the, tsar, on, 13, april, 1605, 560, removed, the, main, barrier, to, further, advances, by, dimitry, russian, troops, began, to, defect, to, his, side, and, on, 1, june, boyars, in, moscow, imprisoned, the, newly, crowned, tsar, boris, s, son, feodor, ii, and, the, boy, s, mother, later, brutally, murdering, them, 560, on, 20, june, the, impostor, made, his, triumphal, entry, into, moscow, and, on, 21, july, he, was, crowned, tsar, by, a, new, patriarch, of, his, own, choosing, the, greek, cypriot, patriarch, ignatius, who, as, bishop, of, ryazan, had, been, the, first, church, leader, to, recognize, dmitry, as, tsar, the, alliance, with, poland, was, furthered, by, dimitriy, s, marriage, per, procura, in, krak, w, with, the, daughter, of, jerzy, mniszech, marina, mniszech, a, polish, noblewoman, with, whom, dmitry, had, fallen, in, love, while, in, poland, the, new, tsarina, outraged, many, russians, by, refusing, to, convert, from, catholicism, to, the, russian, orthodox, faith, commonwealth, king, sigismund, was, a, prominent, guest, at, this, wedding, marina, soon, left, to, join, her, husband, in, moscow, where, she, was, crowned, a, tsarina, in, may, while, dmitry, s, rule, itself, was, nondescript, and, devoid, of, significant, blunders, his, position, was, weak, many, boyars, felt, they, could, gain, more, influence, even, the, throne, for, themselves, and, many, were, still, wary, of, polish, cultural, influence, especially, in, view, of, dmitriy, s, court, being, increasingly, dominated, by, the, aliens, he, brought, with, himself, from, poland, the, golden, freedoms, declaring, all, nobility, equal, that, were, supported, by, lesser, nobility, threatened, the, most, powerful, of, the, boyars, thus, the, boyars, headed, by, prince, vasily, shuyski, began, to, plot, against, dmitry, and, his, pro, polish, faction, accusing, him, of, homosexuality, spreading, roman, catholicism, and, polish, customs, and, selling, russia, to, jesuits, and, the, pope, they, gained, popular, support, especially, as, dmitry, was, visibly, supported, by, a, few, hundred, irregular, commonwealth, forces, which, still, garrisoned, moscow, and, often, engaged, in, various, criminal, acts, angering, the, local, population, on, the, morning, of, 17, may, 1606, about, two, weeks, after, the, marriage, conspirators, stormed, the, kremlin, dmitry, tried, to, flee, through, a, window, but, broke, his, leg, in, the, fall, one, of, the, plotters, shot, him, dead, on, the, spot, at, first, the, body, was, put, on, display, but, it, was, later, cremated, the, ashes, were, reportedly, shot, from, a, cannon, toward, poland, dmitriy, s, reign, had, lasted, a, mere, ten, months, vasili, shuyski, took, his, place, as, tsar, about, five, hundred, of, dmitriy, s, commonwealth, supporters, were, killed, imprisoned, or, forced, to, leave, russia, tsar, vasili, shuyski, was, unpopular, and, weak, in, russia, and, his, reign, was, far, from, stable, 561, he, was, perceived, as, anti, polish, he, had, led, the, coup, against, the, first, false, dmitry, killing, over, 500, polish, soldiers, in, moscow, and, imprisoning, a, polish, envoy, the, civil, war, raged, on, as, in, 1607, the, false, dmitry, ii, appeared, again, supported, by, some, polish, magnates, and, recognized, by, marina, mniszech, as, her, first, husband, this, brought, him, the, support, of, the, magnates, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, who, had, supported, false, dmitry, i, before, adam, wi, niowiecki, roman, r, y, ski, jan, piotr, sapieha, decided, to, support, the, second, pretender, as, well, supplying, him, with, some, early, funds, and, about, 7, 500, soldiers, the, pillaging, of, his, army, especially, of, the, lisowczycy, mercenaries, led, by, aleksander, lisowski, contributed, to, the, placard, in, sergiyev, posad, three, plagues, typhus, tatars, and, poles, in, 1608, together, with, aleksander, kleczkowski, lisowczycy, leading, a, few, hundred, don, cossacks, working, for, the, commonwealth, ragtag, szlachta, and, mercenaries, defeated, the, army, of, tsar, vasili, shuyski, led, by, zakhary, lyapunov, and, ivan, khovansky, at, the, battle, of, zaraysk, and, captured, mikhailov, and, kolomna, then, lisowczycy, advanced, towards, moscow, but, was, defeated, by, vasiliy, buturlin, at, the, battle, of, medvezhiy, brod, losing, most, of, his, plunder, when, polish, commander, jan, piotr, sapieha, failed, to, win, the, siege, of, troitse, sergiyeva, lavra, lisowczycy, retreated, to, the, vicinity, of, rakhmantsevo, soon, however, came, successes, pillages, at, kostroma, soligalich, and, some, other, cities, dmitry, speedily, captured, karachev, bryansk, and, other, towns, he, was, reinforced, by, the, poles, and, in, the, spring, of, 1608, advanced, upon, moscow, routing, the, army, of, tsar, vasily, shuyski, at, bolkhov, 561, dmitry, s, promises, of, the, wholesale, confiscation, of, the, estates, of, the, boyars, drew, many, common, people, to, his, side, the, village, of, tushino, about, twelve, kilometers, from, the, capital, was, converted, into, an, armed, camp, where, dmitry, gathered, his, army, his, forces, initially, included, 7, 000, polish, soldiers, 10, 000, cossacks, and, 10, 000, other, soldiers, including, former, members, of, the, failed, rokosz, of, zebrzydowski, but, his, force, grew, gradually, in, power, and, soon, exceeded, 100, 000, men, he, raised, another, illustrious, captive, feodor, romanov, to, the, rank, of, patriarch, enthroning, him, as, patriarch, filaret, and, won, the, allegiance, of, the, cities, of, yaroslavl, kostroma, vologda, kashin, and, several, others, however, his, fortunes, were, soon, to, reverse, as, the, commonwealth, decided, to, take, a, more, active, stance, in, the, russian, civil, wars, in, 1609, the, zebrzydowski, rebellion, ended, when, tsar, vasili, signed, a, military, alliance, with, charles, ix, of, sweden, on, 28, february, 1609, 563, the, commonwealth, king, sigismund, iii, whose, primary, goal, was, to, regain, the, swedish, throne, got, permission, from, the, polish, sejm, parliament, to, declare, war, on, russia, he, viewed, it, as, an, excellent, opportunity, to, expand, the, commonwealth, s, territory, and, sphere, of, influence, with, hopes, that, the, eventual, outcome, of, the, war, would, catholicize, orthodox, russia, in, this, he, was, strongly, supported, by, the, pope, and, enable, him, to, defeat, sweden, this, plan, also, allowed, him, to, give, a, purpose, to, the, numerous, restless, former, supporters, of, zebrzydowski, luring, them, with, promises, of, wealth, and, fame, awaiting, members, of, the, campaign, beyond, the, commonwealth, s, eastern, border, a, book, published, that, year, by, the, well, travelled, polish, silesian, nobleman, courtier, and, political, activist, pawe, palczowski, of, palczowic, kol, da, moskiewska, the, muscovite, carol, compared, russia, to, the, indian, empires, of, the, new, world, full, of, golden, cities, and, easy, to, conquer, the, treatise, was, written, to, promote, polish, colonialism, and, persuade, delegates, of, the, sejm, in, january, 1609, to, support, sigismund, iii, s, expedition, to, muscovy, palczowski, himself, participated, in, and, perished, during, sigismund, s, muscovy, expedition, some, russian, boyars, assured, sigismund, of, their, support, by, offering, the, throne, to, his, son, prince, w, adys, aw, previously, sigismund, had, been, unwilling, to, commit, the, majority, of, polish, forces, or, his, time, to, the, internal, conflict, in, russia, but, in, 1609, those, factors, made, him, re, evaluate, and, drastically, change, his, policy, although, many, polish, nobles, and, soldiers, were, fighting, for, the, second, false, dmitry, at, the, time, sigismund, iii, and, the, troops, under, his, command, did, not, support, dimitriy, for, the, throne, sigismund, wanted, russia, himself, the, entry, of, sigismund, into, russia, caused, the, majority, of, the, polish, supporters, of, false, dmitry, ii, to, desert, him, and, contributed, to, his, defeat, a, series, of, subsequent, disasters, induced, false, dmitry, ii, to, flee, his, camp, disguised, as, a, peasant, and, to, go, to, kostroma, together, with, marina, dmitry, made, another, unsuccessful, attack, on, moscow, and, supported, by, the, don, cossacks, recovered, a, hold, over, all, of, south, eastern, russia, he, was, killed, however, while, half, drunk, on, 11, december, 1610, by, a, qasim, tatar, princeling, pyotr, urusov, whom, dimitriy, had, flogged, on, a, previous, occasion, a, commonwealth, army, under, the, command, of, hetman, stanis, aw, kiewski, who, was, generally, opposed, to, this, conflict, but, could, not, disobey, the, king, s, orders, crossed, the, border, and, on, 29, september, 1609, laid, siege, to, smolensk, an, important, city, russia, had, captured, from, lithuania, in, 1514, smolensk, was, manned, by, fewer, than, 1, 000, russian, men, commanded, by, the, voivod, mikhail, shein, while, kiewski, commanded, 12, 000, troops, however, smolensk, had, one, major, advantage, the, previous, tsar, boris, godunov, had, sponsored, the, fortification, of, the, city, with, a, massive, fortress, completed, in, 1602, the, poles, found, it, impenetrable, they, settled, into, a, long, siege, firing, artillery, into, the, city, attempting, to, tunnel, under, the, moat, and, building, earthen, ramparts, remnants, of, which, can, still, be, seen, today, the, siege, lasted, 20, months, before, the, poles, with, the, help, of, a, russian, defector, named, andrei, dedishin, eventually, succeeded, in, taking, the, fortress, not, all, of, the, commonwealth, attacks, were, successful, an, early, attack, led, by, hetman, jan, karol, chodkiewicz, with, 2, 000, men, ended, in, defeat, when, the, unpaid, commonwealth, army, mutinied, and, compelled, their, leader, to, retreat, through, the, heart, of, russia, and, back, to, smolensk, not, until, crown, prince, w, adys, aw, arrived, with, tardy, reinforcements, did, the, war, assume, a, different, character, in, the, meantime, lisowczycy, took, and, plundered, pskov, in, 1610, and, clashed, with, the, swedes, operating, in, russia, during, the, ingrian, war, several, different, visions, of, the, campaign, and, political, goals, clashed, in, the, polish, camp, some, of, the, former, members, of, the, zebrzydowski, rebellion, opponents, of, sigismund, actually, advanced, proposals, to, have, sigismund, dethroned, and, dmitriy, or, even, shuyski, elected, king, kiewski, who, from, the, beginning, opposed, the, invasion, of, russia, came, into, conflict, with, sigismund, over, the, scope, methods, and, goal, of, the, campaign, kiewski, represented, the, traditional, views, of, polish, nobility, the, szlachta, which, did, not, support, waging, aggressive, and, dangerous, wars, against, a, strong, enemy, like, russia, thus, kiewski, favored, the, plans, for, peaceful, and, voluntary, union, much, like, that, with, lithuania, kiewski, offered, russian, boyars, rights, and, religious, freedom, envisioning, an, association, resulting, in, the, creation, of, the, polish, lithuanian, muscovite, commonwealth, to, that, end, he, felt, that, moscow, s, cooperation, should, be, gained, via, diplomacy, not, force, sigismund, iii, however, did, not, want, to, engage, in, political, deals, and, compromises, especially, when, these, had, to, include, concessions, to, the, orthodox, church, sigismund, was, a, vocal, almost, fanatical, supporter, of, the, catholic, church, and, counter, reformation, and, believed, that, he, could, win, everything, and, take, moscow, by, force, and, then, establish, his, own, rule, along, with, the, rule, of, roman, catholicism, on, 31, january, 1610, sigismund, received, a, delegation, of, boyars, opposed, to, shuyski, who, asked, w, adys, aw, to, become, the, tsar, on, 24, february, sigismund, sent, them, a, letter, in, which, he, agreed, to, do, so, but, only, when, moscow, was, at, peace, hetman, kiewski, whose, only, other, choice, was, mutiny, decided, to, follow, the, king, s, orders, and, left, smolensk, in, 1610, leaving, only, a, smaller, force, necessary, to, continue, the, siege, with, cossack, reinforcements, he, marched, on, moscow, however, as, he, feared, and, predicted, as, the, polish, lithuanian, forces, pressed, eastwards, ravaging, russian, lands, and, as, sigismund, s, lack, of, willingness, to, compromise, became, more, and, more, apparent, many, supporters, of, the, poles, and, of, the, second, false, dmitry, left, the, pro, polish, camp, and, turned, to, shuyski, s, anti, polish, faction, russian, forces, under, grigory, voluyev, were, coming, to, relieve, smolensk, and, fortified, the, fort, at, tsaryovo, zaymishche, carowo, cariewo, tsarovo, zajmiszcze, to, bar, the, poles, advance, on, moscow, the, siege, of, tsaryovo, began, on, 24, june, 563, however, the, russians, were, not, prepared, for, a, long, siege, and, had, little, food, and, water, inside, the, fort, 563, voluyev, sent, word, for, dmitry, shuyski, tsar, shuyski, s, brother, to, come, to, their, aid, and, lift, the, siege, 564, shuyski, s, troops, marched, for, tsaryovo, not, by, the, direct, route, but, round, about, through, klushino, hoping, to, come, to, tsaryovo, by, the, back, route, 564, shuyski, received, aid, from, swedish, forces, under, the, command, of, jacob, pontusson, de, la, gardie, kiewski, learned, of, shuyski, s, relief, force, and, divided, his, troops, to, meet, the, russians, before, they, could, come, to, tsaryovo, and, lift, the, siege, he, left, at, night, so, that, voluyev, would, not, notice, his, absence, the, combined, russian, and, swedish, armies, were, defeated, on, 4, july, 1610, at, the, battle, of, klushino, k, uszyn, where, 7, 000, polish, elite, cavalry, the, winged, hussars, led, by, the, hetman, himself, defeated, the, numerically, superior, russian, army, of, about, 35, 000, 40, 000, soldiers, 564, this, giant, and, surprising, defeat, of, the, russians, shocked, everyone, and, opened, a, new, phase, in, the, conflict, after, the, news, of, klushino, spread, support, for, tsar, shuyski, almost, completely, evaporated, kiewski, soon, convinced, the, russian, units, at, tsaryovo, which, were, much, stronger, than, the, ones, at, k, uszyn, to, capitulate, and, to, swear, an, oath, of, loyalty, to, w, adys, aw, then, he, incorporated, them, into, his, army, and, moved, towards, moscow, in, august, 1610, many, russian, boyars, accepted, that, sigismund, iii, was, victorious, and, that, w, adys, aw, would, become, the, next, tsar, if, he, converted, to, eastern, orthodoxy, the, russian, duma, voted, for, tsar, shuyski, to, be, removed, from, the, throne, 564, shuyski, s, family, including, the, tsar, were, captured, and, shuyski, was, reportedly, taken, to, a, monastery, forcibly, shaved, as, a, monk, and, compelled, to, remain, at, the, monastery, under, guard, he, was, later, sent, to, warsaw, as, a, kind, of, war, trophy, and, eventually, died, in, gostynin, shortly, after, shuyski, was, removed, both, kiewski, and, the, second, false, dmitri, arrived, at, moscow, with, their, separate, armies, it, was, a, tense, moment, filled, with, the, confusion, of, the, conflict, various, pro, and, anti, polish, swedish, and, domestic, boyar, factions, vied, for, temporary, control, of, the, situation, the, russian, army, and, the, people, themselves, were, unsure, if, this, was, an, invasion, and, that, they, should, close, and, defend, the, city, or, if, it, was, a, liberating, force, that, should, be, allowed, in, and, welcomed, as, allies, after, a, few, skirmishes, the, pro, polish, faction, gained, dominance, and, the, poles, were, allowed, into, moscow, on, 8, october, 564, the, boyars, opened, moscow, s, gates, to, the, polish, troops, and, asked, kiewski, to, protect, them, from, anarchy, the, moscow, kremlin, was, then, garrisoned, by, polish, troops, commanded, by, aleksander, gosiewski, on, 27, july, a, treaty, was, signed, between, the, boyars, and, kiewski, promising, the, russian, boyars, the, same, vast, privileges, the, polish, szlachta, had, in, exchange, for, them, recognizing, w, adys, aw, as, the, new, tsar, however, kiewski, did, not, know, that, sigismund, who, remained, at, smolensk, already, had, other, plans, in, the, meantime, kiewski, and, the, second, false, dmitriy, formerly, reluctant, allies, began, to, part, ways, the, second, false, dmitry, had, lost, much, of, his, influence, over, the, polish, court, and, kiewski, would, eventually, try, to, drive, dmitry, from, the, capital, kiewski, soon, began, manoeuvring, for, a, tsar, of, polish, origin, particularly, the, 15, year, old, prince, w, adys, aw, the, boyars, had, offered, the, throne, to, w, adys, aw, at, least, twice, in, the, hopes, of, having, the, liberal, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, end, the, despotic, rule, of, their, current, tsars, through, kiewski, s, work, the, pro, polish, factions, among, the, boyars, composed, of, knyazes, fyodor, mstislavsky, vasily, galitzine, fyodor, sheremetev, daniil, mezetsky, and, diaks, vasily, telepnyov, and, tomi, o, agowski, gained, dominance, and, once, again, a, majority, of, the, boyars, said, that, they, would, support, w, adys, aw, for, the, throne, if, he, converted, to, orthodoxy, and, if, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, returned, the, fortresses, that, they, had, captured, in, the, war, however, sigismund, supported, by, some, of, the, more, devout, and, zealous, nobility, was, completely, opposed, to, the, conversion, of, the, prince, from, that, point, the, planned, polish, lithuanian, muscovite, union, began, to, fall, apart, offended, and, angered, by, sigismund, the, boyars, dragged, their, feet, on, supporting, w, adys, aw, they, were, divided, between, electing, vasily, galitzine, michael, romanov, also, 15, years, old, or, the, second, false, dmitriy, kiewski, acted, quickly, making, promises, without, the, consent, of, the, still, absent, king, and, the, boyars, elected, w, adys, aw, as, the, new, tsar, kiewski, had, the, most, prominent, of, the, opponents, fyodor, romanov, michael, s, father, and, the, patriarch, of, moscow, exiled, from, russia, in, order, to, secure, polish, support, after, the, election, of, w, adys, aw, the, second, false, dmitry, fled, from, tushino, a, city, near, moscow, to, his, base, at, kaluga, however, his, position, was, precarious, even, there, and, he, was, killed, on, 20, december, by, one, of, his, own, men, marina, mniszech, though, was, pregnant, with, the, new, heir, to, the, russian, throne, ivan, dmitriyevich, and, she, would, still, be, a, factor, in, russian, politics, until, her, eventual, death, in, 1614, w, adys, aw, faced, further, opposition, from, a, seemingly, unlikely, party, his, father, when, kiewski, returned, to, meet, sigismund, at, smolensk, in, november, of, that, year, sigismund, iii, changed, his, mind, and, decided, that, he, could, gain, the, russian, throne, for, himself, a, majority, of, the, russians, opposed, the, move, especially, as, sigismund, didn, t, hide, his, intent, to, catholicize, and, polonize, the, russian, tsardom, kiewski, found, himself, in, an, awkward, position, he, had, promised, the, boyars, prince, w, adys, aw, to, keep, the, russian, throne, for, poland, and, he, knew, that, they, would, not, accept, sigismund, iii, who, was, unpopular, throughout, russia, however, he, also, had, to, explain, this, to, his, king, who, was, convinced, from, his, conquests, in, the, west, of, his, popularity, in, russia, eventually, kiewski, disappointed, with, sigismund, returned, to, poland, sigismund, eventually, compromised, and, decided, that, he, would, allow, his, son, to, take, the, throne, and, that, he, would, rule, as, regent, until, w, adys, aw, came, of, age, thus, he, required, that, the, boyars, who, submitted, and, swore, allegiance, to, prince, w, adys, aw, would, also, have, to, swear, an, oath, to, him, the, boyars, were, more, resistant, to, this, request, and, support, for, the, poles, eroded, fast, w, adys, aw, was, never, able, to, take, real, power, and, the, war, soon, resumed, sigismund, and, w, adys, aw, left, the, city, for, safer, ground, as, tensions, grew, and, the, small, polish, garrison, at, the, kremlin, soon, became, isolated, and, subject, to, increased, hostility, as, more, and, more, of, the, formerly, pro, polish, boyars, began, to, change, factions, the, polish, forces, outside, moscow, under, the, command, of, jan, piotr, sapieha, clashed, with, the, growing, anti, polish, russian, forces, of, the, so, called, first, volunteer, army, led, by, prokopy, lyapunov, in, the, meantime, the, siege, of, smolensk, continued, even, as, w, adys, aw, was, named, tsar, of, russia, and, cities, and, forts, throughout, the, area, swore, allegiance, to, the, poles, however, sigismund, iii, required, that, smolensk, not, only, swear, allegiance, but, open, its, gates, to, the, poles, which, the, russians, refused, to, do, kiewski, fortified, moscow, with, his, army, and, returned, to, king, sigismund, iii, who, had, remained, at, smolensk, while, kiewski, negotiated, in, moscow, the, largest, tunneling, project, at, smolensk, came, in, december, 1610, however, the, poles, only, managed, to, destroy, more, of, the, outer, wall, the, inner, wall, remained, intact, the, siege, continued, at, one, point, the, polish, guns, breached, the, outer, wall, and, the, governor, of, braclaw, brac, aw, ordered, his, soldiers, to, rush, in, however, the, russians, had, predicted, where, the, breach, would, occur, and, had, fortified, that, part, of, the, wall, with, additional, men, both, sets, of, troops, were, slaughtered, and, the, poles, were, eventually, beaten, back, a, 1611, uprising, in, moscow, against, the, polish, garrison, 564, marked, the, end, of, russian, tolerance, for, the, commonwealth, intervention, the, citizens, of, moscow, had, voluntarily, participated, in, the, coup, in, 1606, killing, 500, polish, soldiers, now, ruled, by, the, poles, they, once, again, revolted, the, moscow, burghers, took, over, the, munition, store, but, polish, troops, defeated, the, first, wave, of, attackers, and, the, fighting, resulted, in, a, large, fire, that, consumed, part, of, moscow, 564, from, july, onward, the, situation, of, the, commonwealth, forces, became, grave, as, the, uprising, turned, into, a, siege, of, the, polish, held, kremlin, reportedly, the, poles, had, imprisoned, the, leader, of, the, orthodox, church, patriarch, hermogenes, when, the, russians, attacked, moscow, the, poles, ordered, him, as, the, man, with, the, most, authority, with, the, russians, at, the, time, to, sign, a, statement, to, call, off, the, attack, hermogenes, refused, and, was, starved, to, death, the, polish, kremlin, garrison, then, found, itself, besieged, 564, in, the, meantime, in, late, 1611, prince, dmitry, pozharsky, was, asked, to, lead, the, public, opposition, against, the, poles, 564, organized, by, the, merchants, guild, of, nizhny, novgorod, the, respected, town, butcher, literally, a, meat, trader, kuzma, minin, oversaw, the, handling, of, funds, donated, by, the, merchants, to, form, the, second, volunteer, army, russian, when, part, of, the, polish, army, mutinied, in, january, 1612, due, to, unpaid, wages, and, retreated, from, russia, towards, the, commonwealth, the, forces, of, the, second, volunteer, army, strengthened, the, other, anti, polish, russian, forces, in, moscow, the, 9, 000, strong, polish, army, under, hetman, jan, karol, chodkiewicz, attempted, to, lift, the, siege, 564, and, clashed, with, russian, forces, attempting, to, break, through, to, polish, forces, in, the, kremlin, on, 1, september, the, polish, forces, used, cavalry, attacks, in, the, open, field, exercising, tactics, that, were, new, to, them, escorting, a, mobile, tabor, fortress, through, the, city, after, early, polish, successes, the, russian, cossack, reinforcements, had, forced, chodkiewicz, s, forces, to, retreat, from, moscow, 564, russian, reinforcements, under, prince, pozharsky, eventually, starved, the, commonwealth, garrison, there, were, reports, of, cannibalism, and, forced, its, surrender, on, 1, november, though, some, sources, give, 6, november, or, 7, november, after, the, 19, month, siege, 564, a, historian, parker, writes, vividly, of, the, polish, soldiers, first, they, ate, grass, and, offal, then, they, ate, each, other, and, the, survivors, finally, surrendered, the, moscow, kremlin, fell, on, 6, november, 1612, on, 7, november, the, polish, soldiers, withdrew, from, moscow, although, the, commonwealth, negotiated, a, safe, passage, the, russian, forces, massacred, half, of, the, former, kremlin, garrison, forces, as, they, left, the, fortress, 564, thus, the, russian, army, recaptured, moscow, on, 2, june, 1611, smolensk, had, finally, fallen, to, the, poles, after, enduring, 20, months, of, siege, two, harsh, winters, and, dwindling, food, supplies, the, russians, in, smolensk, finally, reached, their, limit, as, the, polish, lithuanian, troops, broke, through, the, city, gates, the, polish, army, advised, by, the, runaway, traitor, andrei, dedishin, discovered, a, weakness, in, the, fortress, defenses, and, on, 13, june, 1611, cavalier, of, malta, bart, omiej, nowodworski, inserted, a, mine, into, a, sewer, canal, the, explosion, created, a, large, breach, in, the, fortress, walls, the, fortress, fell, on, the, same, day, 563, the, remaining, 3, 000, russian, defenders, took, refuge, in, the, assumption, cathedral, and, blew, themselves, up, with, stores, of, gunpowder, to, avoid, death, at, the, hands, of, the, invaders, 563, although, it, was, a, blow, to, lose, smolensk, the, defeat, freed, up, russian, troops, to, fight, the, commonwealth, in, moscow, and, the, russian, commander, at, smolensk, mikhail, borisovich, shein, was, considered, a, hero, for, holding, out, as, long, as, he, had, he, was, captured, at, smolensk, and, remained, a, prisoner, of, poland, lithuania, for, the, next, nine, years, after, the, fall, of, smolensk, the, russo, polish, border, remained, relatively, quiet, for, the, next, few, years, however, no, official, treaty, was, signed, sigismund, criticized, by, the, sejm, the, polish, parliament, made, up, of, the, szlachta, who, were, always, reluctant, to, levy, taxes, upon, themselves, to, pay, for, any, military, force, 565, for, his, failure, to, keep, moscow, received, little, funding, for, the, army, this, led, to, a, mutiny, of, the, polish, regular, army, wojsko, kwarciane, or, rather, to, the, specific, semi, legal, form, of, mutiny, practiced, in, the, commonwealth, a, konfederacja, confederatio, the, resulting, konfederacja, rohaczewska, was, considered, the, largest, and, most, vicious, of, the, soldiers, konfederacjas, in, the, history, of, the, commonwealth, and, it, pillaged, commonwealth, territories, from, 1612, until, the, most, rebellious, of, the, konfederacjas, were, defeated, on, 17, may, 1614, at, the, battle, of, rohatyn, 565, whereupon, the, rest, received, their, wages, the, leader, of, the, konfederacja, jan, karwacki, was, captured, and, sent, in, chains, by, the, future, hetman, stanis, aw, koniecpolski, to, his, mentor, hetman, kiewski, and, later, executed, in, lw, w, the, ottoman, empire, further, criticized, sigismund, because, the, cossacks, in, ukraine, once, again, had, begun, to, make, unsanctioned, raids, into, turkish, territory, thus, poland, lithuania, got, no, support, from, the, ottoman, empire, in, its, war, in, the, meantime, the, russian, time, of, troubles, was, far, from, over, and, russia, had, no, strength, to, take, advantage, of, the, commonwealth, s, weakness, 565, on, 21, february, 1613, the, zemsky, sobor, assembly, of, the, land, named, michael, romanov, the, now, 16, year, old, son, of, fyodor, romanov, the, new, tsar, 565, fyodor, now, installed, as, patriarch, filaret, was, a, popular, boyar, and, patriarch, of, moscow, one, of, several, boyars, who, vied, to, gain, control, of, the, russian, throne, during, the, time, of, troubles, the, romanovs, were, a, powerful, boyar, family, michael, s, great, aunt, the, sister, of, his, grandfather, was, anastasia, romanovna, the, wife, of, ivan, the, terrible, however, the, new, tsar, had, many, opponents, marina, mniszech, tried, until, her, death, in, 1614, to, install, her, child, as, tsar, of, russia, various, boyar, factions, still, vied, for, power, trying, to, unseat, the, young, tsar, michael, and, sweden, intervened, in, force, trying, to, gain, the, throne, for, duke, carl, philip, even, succeeding, for, a, few, months, however, philip, received, even, less, support, than, w, adys, aw, and, the, swedes, were, soon, forced, to, retreat, from, russia, while, both, countries, were, shaken, by, internal, strife, many, smaller, factions, thrived, polish, lisowczycy, mercenaries, who, were, essential, in, the, defense, of, smolensk, in, 1612, when, most, regulars, wojsko, kwarciane, mutinied, and, joined, the, konfederacja, rohatynska, were, content, to, guard, the, polish, border, against, the, russian, incursions, for, the, next, three, years, however, in, 1615, aleksander, j, zef, lisowski, gathered, many, outlaws, and, invaded, russia, with, 6, chor, giew, of, cavalry, he, besieged, bryansk, and, defeated, the, relief, force, of, a, few, thousand, soldiers, under, prince, yuri, shakhovskoy, near, karachev, then, lisowski, defeated, the, front, guard, of, a, force, several, times, larger, than, his, own, under, the, command, of, knyaz, dmitry, pozharsky, who, decided, to, defend, instead, of, attack, and, fortified, his, forces, in, a, camp, lisowczycy, broke, contact, with, his, forces, burned, belyov, and, likhvin, took, peremyshl, turned, north, defeated, the, russian, army, at, rzhev, proceeded, north, towards, kashin, burned, torzhok, and, returned, to, poland, heavy, with, loot, without, any, further, opposition, from, russian, forces, lisowski, and, his, forces, remained, at, the, russo, polish, border, until, autumn, 1616, at, which, point, lisowski, suddenly, fell, ill, and, died, on, 11, october, the, formation, was, then, known, as, lisowczycy, despite, the, death, of, lisowski, his, forces, remained, a, significant, threat, in, 1616, they, captured, kursk, and, defeated, russian, forces, at, bolkhov, eventually, the, commonwealth, sejm, voted, to, raise, the, funds, necessary, to, resume, large, scale, military, operations, the, final, attempt, by, sigismund, and, w, adys, aw, to, gain, the, throne, was, a, new, campaign, launched, on, 6, april, 1617, w, adys, aw, was, the, nominal, commander, but, it, was, hetman, chodkiewicz, who, had, actual, control, over, the, army, in, october, the, towns, of, dorogobuzh, drohobu, drohobycz, and, vyazma, wia, ma, surrendered, quickly, recognizing, w, adys, aw, as, the, tsar, however, the, commonwealth, forces, met, stubborn, resistance, near, mozhaisk, and, chodkiewicz, s, plans, for, a, quick, advance, to, moscow, failed, w, adys, aw, did, not, have, enough, forces, to, advance, to, moscow, again, especially, because, the, russian, support, for, the, poles, was, all, but, gone, by, that, time, in, 1618, petro, sahaidachny, agreed, to, join, the, campaign, against, the, tsardom, of, russia, his, army, of, zaporozhian, cossacks, invaded, from, the, south, captured, and, sacked, a, number, of, towns, such, as, livny, yelets, dankov, etc, and, headed, for, moscow, the, russian, army, opposing, the, poles, retreated, to, moscow, and, on, 2, october, chodkiewicz, and, sahaidachny, together, launched, a, siege, of, the, russian, capital, however, their, armies, were, not, ready, for, a, long, siege, and, shortly, after, the, night, assault, on, october, 10, 11, failed, the, siege, was, lifted, negotiations, began, and, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, in, december, 1618, in, the, end, sigismund, did, not, succeed, in, becoming, tsar, or, in, securing, the, throne, for, w, adys, aw, but, he, was, able, to, expand, the, commonwealth, s, territory, during, his, reign, poland, lithuania, was, the, largest, and, most, populous, country, in, europe, on, 11, december, 1618, the, truce, of, deulino, 567, which, concluded, the, dimitriad, s, war, gave, the, commonwealth, control, over, some, of, the, conquered, territories, including, the, territories, of, chernigov, and, severia, siewiersk, and, the, city, of, smolensk, and, proclaimed, a, 15, year, truce, w, adys, aw, refused, to, relinquish, his, claim, to, the, russian, throne, even, though, sigismund, had, already, done, so, while, the, commonwealth, gained, some, territories, in, the, east, in, terms, of, finance, and, lives, it, was, a, very, costly, victory, in, 1632, the, truce, of, deulino, expired, and, hostilities, immediately, resumed, in, the, course, of, a, conflict, known, as, the, smolensk, war, 587, this, time, the, war, was, started, by, the, russians, who, tried, to, exploit, the, suspected, weakness, of, the, commonwealth, after, the, unexpected, death, of, sigismund, iii, 587, however, they, failed, to, regain, smolensk, mikhail, shein, surrendered, to, w, adys, aw, iv, on, 1, march, 1634, and, the, russians, accepted, the, treaty, of, polyanovka, in, may, 1634, 587, the, russians, had, to, pay, 20, 000, rubles, to, the, commonwealth, but, w, adys, aw, relinquished, his, claim, to, the, russian, throne, 587, and, recognized, michael, as, the, legitimate, tsar, of, russia, also, returning, the, russian, royal, insignia, the, story, of, the, dymitriads, and, false, dimitrys, proved, useful, to, future, generations, of, rulers, and, politicians, in, poland, and, russia, and, a, distorted, version, of, the, real, events, gained, much, fame, in, russia, as, well, as, in, poland, in, poland, the, dmitriads, campaign, is, remembered, as, the, height, of, the, polish, golden, age, the, time, poles, captured, moscow, something, that, even, four, million, troops, from, adolf, hitler, s, nazi, germany, and, other, axis, powers, could, not, manage, in, russia, it, was, useful, to, the, new, dynasty, of, tsars, the, romanovs, who, understood, that, history, is, a, powerful, political, tool, written, by, the, victors, they, tried, to, erase, all, references, and, theories, to, their, role, in, creating, the, false, dmitrys, self, interested, cooperation, with, polish, and, swedish, interventions, or, their, opposition, to, the, liberal, unia, troista, instead, they, supported, a, portrayal, of, dmitriads, as, the, heroic, defense, of, russian, nation, against, the, barbaric, invasion, of, polish, jesuit, alliance, who, attempted, to, destroy, the, russian, orthodox, culture, this, was, the, history, line, shown, by, the, famous, russian, historian, nikolai, mikhailovich, karamzin, beautifully, described, by, aleksandr, pushkin, in, his, boris, godunov, and, by, modest, mussorgsky, in, his, opera, boris, godunov, and, later, romanticized, in, the, film, minin, and, pozharsky, by, vsevolod, pudovkin, the, monument, to, minin, and, pozharsky, was, erected, in, moscow, s, red, square, in, 1818, the, communist, regime, of, the, soviet, union, also, found, this, war, a, useful, propaganda, tool, especially, during, the, times, of, the, polish, soviet, war, the, dymitriads, were, also, useful, for, the, propaganda, of, j, zef, pi, sudski, s, polish, government, between, the, world, wars, in, post, soviet, russia, the, only, autumn, holiday, the, national, unity, day, first, celebrated, on, 4, november, 2005, commemorates, the, popular, uprising, that, ejected, the, occupying, force, from, moscow, in, november, 1612, and, more, generally, the, end, of, the, time,
