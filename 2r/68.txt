fertile, crescent, europe, africa, siberia, the, lower, paleolithic, or, lower, palaeolithic, is, the, earliest, subdivision, of, the, paleolithic, or, old, stone, age, it, spans, the, time, from, around, 3, 3, million, years, ago, when, the, first, evidence, for, stone, tool, production, and, use, by, hominins, appears, in, the, current, archaeological, record, until, around, 300, 000, years, ago, spanning, the, oldowan, mode, 1, and, acheulean, mode, 2, lithics, industries, in, african, archaeology, the, time, period, roughly, corresponds, to, the, early, stone, age, the, earliest, finds, dating, back, to, 3, 3, million, years, ago, with, lomekwian, stone, tool, technology, spanning, mode, 1, stone, tool, technology, which, begins, roughly, 2, 6, million, years, ago, and, ends, between, 400, 000, and, 250, 000, years, ago, with, mode, 2, technology, the, middle, paleolithic, followed, the, lower, paleolithic, and, recorded, the, appearance, of, the, more, advanced, prepared, core, tool, making, technologies, such, as, the, mousterian, whether, the, earliest, control, of, fire, by, hominins, dates, to, the, lower, or, to, the, middle, paleolithic, remains, an, open, question, the, lower, paleolithic, began, with, the, appearance, of, the, first, stone, tools, in, the, world, formerly, associated, with, the, emergence, of, homo, habilis, some, 2, 8, million, years, ago, this, date, has, been, pushed, back, significantly, by, finds, of, the, early, 2000s, the, oldowan, or, mode, 1, horizon, long, considered, the, oldest, type, of, lithic, industry, is, now, considered, to, have, developed, from, about, 2, 6, million, years, ago, with, the, beginning, gelasian, lower, pleistocene, possibly, first, used, by, australopithecine, forebears, of, the, genus, homo, such, as, australopithecus, garhi, however, even, older, tools, were, later, discovered, at, the, single, site, of, lomekwi, 3, in, kenya, in, 2015, dated, to, as, early, as, 3, 3, million, years, ago, as, such, they, would, predate, the, pleistocene, the, gelasian, and, fall, into, the, late, pliocene, the, piacenzian, the, early, members, of, the, genus, homo, produced, primitive, tools, summarized, under, the, oldowan, industry, which, remained, dominant, for, nearly, a, million, years, from, about, 2, 5, to, 1, 7, million, years, ago, homo, habilis, is, assumed, to, have, lived, primarily, on, scavenging, using, tools, to, cleave, meat, off, carrion, or, to, break, bones, to, extract, the, marrow, the, move, from, the, mostly, frugivorous, or, omnivorous, diet, of, hominin, australopithecus, to, the, carnivorous, scavenging, lifestyle, of, early, homo, has, been, explained, by, the, climate, changes, in, east, africa, associated, with, the, quaternary, glaciation, decreasing, oceanic, evaporation, produced, a, drier, climate, and, the, expansion, of, the, savannah, at, the, expense, of, forests, reduced, availability, of, fruits, stimulated, some, proto, australopithecines, to, search, out, new, food, sources, found, in, the, drier, savannah, ecology, derek, bickerton, 2009, has, designated, to, this, period, the, move, from, simple, animal, communication, systems, found, in, all, great, apes, to, the, earliest, form, of, symbolic, communication, systems, capable, of, displacement, referring, to, items, not, currently, within, sensory, perception, and, motivated, by, the, need, to, recruit, group, members, for, scavenging, large, carcasses, homo, erectus, appeared, by, about, 1, 8, million, years, ago, via, the, transitional, variety, homo, ergaster, homo, erectus, moved, from, scavenging, to, hunting, developing, the, hunting, gathering, lifestyle, that, would, remain, dominant, throughout, the, paleolithic, into, the, mesolithic, the, unlocking, of, the, new, niche, of, hunting, gathering, subsistence, drove, a, number, of, further, behavioral, and, physiological, changes, leading, to, the, appearance, of, homo, heidelbergensis, by, some, 800, 000, 600, 000, years, ago, as, such, homo, rose, to, the, ranks, of, omnivorous, predators, and, possibly, became, hypercarnivores, before, homo, sapiens, again, transformed, into, hypocarnivores, as, active, hunters, they, came, in, opposition, to, other, quadruped, predators, and, started, living, in, large, groups, homo, erectus, migrated, out, of, africa, and, dispersed, throughout, eurasia, stone, tools, in, malaysia, have, been, dated, to, be, 1, 83, million, years, old, the, peking, man, fossil, discovered, in, 1929, is, roughly, 700, 000, years, old, in, europe, the, olduwan, tradition, known, in, europe, as, abbevillian, split, into, two, parallel, traditions, the, clactonian, a, flake, tradition, and, the, acheulean, a, hand, axe, tradition, the, levallois, technique, for, knapping, flint, developed, during, this, time, the, carrier, species, from, africa, to, europe, was, undoubtedly, homo, erectus, this, type, of, human, is, more, clearly, linked, to, the, flake, tradition, which, spread, across, southern, europe, through, the, balkans, to, appear, relatively, densely, in, southeast, asia, many, mousterian, finds, in, the, middle, paleolithic, have, been, knapped, using, a, levallois, technique, suggesting, that, neanderthals, evolved, from, homo, erectus, or, perhaps, homo, heidelbergensis, see, below, monte, poggiolo, near, forl, italy, is, the, location, of, an, acheulian, littoral, handaxe, industry, dating, from, 1, 8, to, 1, 1, million, years, ago, the, advent, of, technology, and, both, verbal, and, non, verbal, communication, due, to, transition, to, group, hunting, and, gathering, resulted, in, the, expansion, of, the, parts, of, the, brain, associated, with, these, as, well, as, greater, cognition, due, to, it, being, interlinked, with, the, two, later, behavioral, adaptations, to, further, social, life, uncertain, food, distribution, resulting, in, need, to, find, and, secure, food, and, remember, where, it, could, be, found, and, ecological, changes, brought, about, by, homo, led, to, the, further, expansion, of, the, brain, in, the, areas, of, problem, solving, memory, etc, ultimately, leading, to, the, great, behavioral, flexibility, highly, efficient, communication, and, ecological, dominance, of, humanity, the, biological, pre, adaptations, of, the, great, apes, and, earlier, primates, allowed, the, brain, to, expand, threefold, within, just, 2, to, 2, 3, million, years, of, the, pleistocene, in, response, to, increasingly, complex, societies, and, changing, habitats, the, appearance, of, homo, heidelbergensis, about, 600, 000, years, ago, heralds, a, number, of, other, new, varieties, such, as, homo, rhodesiensis, and, homo, cepranensis, about, 400, 000, years, ago, homo, heidelbergensis, is, a, candidate, for, first, developing, an, early, form, of, symbolic, language, whether, control, of, fire, and, earliest, burials, date, to, this, period, or, only, appear, during, the, middle, paleolithic, is, an, open, question, also, in, europe, a, type, of, human, appeared, that, was, intermediate, between, homo, erectus, and, homo, sapiens, sometimes, summarized, under, archaic, homo, sapiens, typified, by, such, fossils, as, those, found, at, swanscombe, steinheim, tautavel, and, vertesszollos, homo, palaeohungaricus, the, hand, axe, tradition, originates, in, the, same, period, the, intermediate, may, have, been, homo, heidelbergensis, held, responsible, for, the, manufacture, of, improved, mode, 2, acheulean, tool, types, in, africa, after, 600, 000, years, ago, flakes, and, axes, coexisted, in, europe, sometimes, at, the, same, site, the, axe, tradition, however, spread, to, a, different, range, in, the, east, it, appears, in, arabia, and, india, but, more, importantly, it, does, not, appear, in, southeast, asia, from, about, 300, 000, years, ago, technology, social, structures, and, behaviour, appear, to, grow, more, complex, with, prepared, core, technique, lithics, earliest, instances, of, burial, and, changes, to, hunting, gathering, patterns, of, subsistence, homo, sapiens, first, appeared, about, 300, 000, years, ago, as, evidenced, by, fossils, found, at, jebel, irhoud, in, morocco, guy, ellcock, pilgrim, a, british, geologist, and, palaeontologist, discovered, 1, 5, million, year, old, prehistoric, human, teeth, and, part, of, a, jaw, indicating, that, ancient, people, intelligent, hominins, dating, as, far, back, as, 1, 500, 000, ybp, acheulean, period, lived, in, the, pinjore, region, near, chandigarh, quartzite, tools, of, the, lower, paleolithic, period, were, excavated, in, this, region, extending, from, pinjore, in, haryana, to, nalagarh, solan, district, in, himachal, pradesh, the, lands, of, gujarat, has, been, continuously, inhabited, from, the, lower, paleolithic, c, 200, 000, bp, period, several, sites, of, stone, age, are, discovered, in, riverbeds, of, sabarmati, mahi, river, and, lower, narmada, rivers, of, gujarat
