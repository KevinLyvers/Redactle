the, first, modern, humans, are, believed, to, have, inhabited, south, africa, more, than, 100, 000, years, ago, in, 1999, unesco, designated, the, region, the, cradle, of, humankind, world, heritage, site, south, africa, s, first, known, inhabitants, have, been, referred, to, as, the, khoisan, the, khwe, and, the, san, starting, in, about, 1, 000, bce, these, groups, were, then, joined, by, the, bantu, tribes, who, migrated, from, western, and, central, africa, during, what, is, known, as, the, bantu, expansion, european, exploration, of, the, african, coast, began, in, the, 13th, century, when, portugal, sought, an, alternative, route, to, the, silk, road, to, china, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, century, portuguese, explorers, traveled, down, the, west, african, coast, detailing, and, mapping, the, coastline, and, in, 1488, they, rounded, the, cape, of, good, hope, the, dutch, east, india, company, established, a, trading, post, in, cape, town, under, the, command, of, jan, van, riebeeck, in, 1652, european, workers, who, settled, at, the, cape, became, known, as, the, free, burghers, and, gradually, established, farms, in, the, dutch, cape, colony, following, the, invasion, of, the, cape, colony, by, the, british, in, 1795, and, 1806, mass, migrations, collectively, known, as, the, great, trek, occurred, during, which, the, voortrekkers, established, several, boer, republics, in, the, interior, of, south, africa, the, discoveries, of, diamonds, and, gold, in, the, nineteenth, century, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, fortunes, of, the, region, propelling, it, onto, the, world, stage, and, introducing, a, shift, away, from, an, exclusively, agrarian, based, economy, towards, industrialisation, and, the, development, of, urban, infrastructure, the, discoveries, also, led, to, new, conflicts, culminating, in, open, warfare, between, the, boer, settlers, and, the, british, empire, fought, for, control, over, the, nascent, south, african, mining, industry, following, the, defeat, of, the, boers, in, the, anglo, boer, or, south, african, war, 1899, 1902, the, union, of, south, africa, was, created, as, a, self, governing, dominion, of, the, british, empire, on, 31, may, 1910, in, terms, of, the, south, africa, act, 1909, which, amalgamated, the, four, previously, separate, british, colonies, cape, colony, colony, of, natal, transvaal, colony, and, orange, river, colony, the, country, became, a, fully, sovereign, nation, state, within, the, british, empire, in, 1934, following, enactment, of, the, status, of, the, union, act, the, monarchy, came, to, an, end, on, 31, may, 1961, replaced, by, a, republic, as, the, consequence, of, a, 1960, referendum, which, legitimised, the, country, becoming, the, republic, of, south, africa, from, 1948, 1994, south, african, politics, was, dominated, by, afrikaner, nationalism, racial, segregation, and, white, minority, rule, known, officially, as, apartheid, were, implemented, in, 1948, on, 2, february, 1990, fw, de, klerk, then, president, of, south, africa, and, leader, of, the, nationalist, party, unbanned, the, african, national, congress, anc, and, freed, nelson, mandela, from, life, imprisonment, on, robben, island, the, codesa, talks, negotiated, the, creation, of, a, new, non, racial, democratic, south, africa, for, which, de, klerk, and, mandela, were, later, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, these, negotiations, led, to, the, creation, of, a, democratic, constitution, for, all, south, africa, on, 27, april, 1994, after, decades, of, anc, led, resistance, to, white, minority, rule, armed, guerrilla, struggle, and, international, opposition, to, apartheid, which, ended, in, crippling, sanctions, against, the, minority, white, government, the, anc, achieved, a, majority, in, the, country, s, first, democratic, election, since, then, despite, a, continually, decreasing, electoral, majority, the, anc, has, ruled, south, africa, the, anc, has, notionally, been, in, alliance, with, the, south, african, communist, party, and, the, congress, of, south, african, trade, unions, since, 1994, high, rates, of, crime, corruption, unemployment, low, economic, growth, an, ongoing, energy, crisis, and, poorly, maintained, infrastructure, are, some, of, the, problems, challenging, contemporary, south, africa, scientists, researching, the, periods, before, written, historical, records, were, made, have, established, that, the, territory, of, what, is, now, referred, to, generically, as, south, africa, was, one, of, the, important, centers, of, human, evolution, it, was, inhabited, by, australopithecines, since, at, least, 2, 5, million, years, ago, modern, human, settlement, occurred, around, 125, 000, years, ago, in, the, middle, stone, age, as, shown, by, archaeological, discoveries, at, klasies, river, caves, the, first, human, habitation, is, associated, with, a, dna, group, originating, in, a, northwestern, area, of, southern, africa, and, still, prevalent, in, the, indigenous, khoisan, khoi, and, san, southern, africa, was, later, populated, by, bantu, speaking, people, who, migrated, from, the, western, region, of, central, africa, during, the, early, centuries, ad, professor, raymond, dart, discovered, the, skull, of, a, 2, 51, million, year, old, taung, child, in, 1924, the, first, example, of, australopithecus, africanus, ever, found, following, in, dart, s, footsteps, robert, broom, discovered, a, new, much, more, robust, hominid, in, 1938, paranthropus, robustus, at, kromdraai, and, in, 1947, uncovered, several, more, examples, of, australopithecus, africanus, at, sterkfontein, at, the, blombos, cave, in, 2002, stones, were, discovered, engraved, with, grid, or, cross, hatch, patterns, dated, to, some, 70, 000, years, ago, this, has, been, interpreted, as, the, earliest, example, ever, discovered, of, abstract, art, or, symbolic, art, created, by, homo, sapiens, many, more, species, of, early, hominid, have, come, to, light, in, recent, decades, the, oldest, is, little, foot, a, collection, of, footbones, of, an, unknown, hominid, between, 2, 2, and, 3, 3, million, years, old, discovered, at, sterkfontein, by, ronald, j, clarke, an, important, recent, find, was, that, of, 1, 9, million, year, old, australopithecus, sediba, discovered, in, 2008, in, 2015, the, discovery, near, johannesburg, of, a, previously, unknown, species, of, homo, was, announced, named, homo, naledi, it, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, most, important, paleontological, discoveries, in, modern, times, the, descendants, of, the, middle, paleolithic, populations, are, thought, to, be, the, aboriginal, san, and, khoikhoi, tribes, these, are, collectively, known, as, the, khoisan, a, modern, european, portmanteau, of, these, two, tribes, names, the, settlement, of, southern, africa, by, the, khoisan, corresponds, to, the, earliest, separation, of, the, extant, homo, sapiens, populations, altogether, associated, in, genetic, science, with, what, is, described, in, scientific, terms, as, matrilinear, haplogroup, l0, mtdna, and, patrilinear, haplogroup, a, y, dna, originating, in, a, northwestern, area, of, southern, africa, the, san, and, khoikhoi, are, essentially, distinguished, only, by, their, respective, occupations, whereas, the, san, were, hunter, gatherers, the, khoikhoi, were, pastoral, herders, the, initial, origin, of, the, khoikhoi, remains, uncertain, archaeological, discoveries, of, livestock, bones, on, the, cape, peninsula, indicate, that, the, khoikhoi, began, to, settle, there, by, about, 2000, years, ago, in, the, late, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, portuguese, mariners, who, were, the, first, europeans, at, the, cape, encountered, pastoral, khoikhoi, with, livestock, later, english, and, dutch, seafarers, in, the, late, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, exchanged, metals, for, cattle, and, sheep, with, the, khoikhoi, the, conventional, view, is, that, availability, of, livestock, was, one, reason, why, in, the, mid, 17th, century, the, dutch, east, india, company, established, a, staging, post, where, the, port, city, of, cape, town, is, today, situated, the, establishment, of, the, staging, post, by, the, dutch, east, india, company, at, the, cape, in, 1652, soon, brought, the, khoikhoi, into, conflict, with, dutch, settlers, over, land, ownership, competition, between, dutch, and, khoikhoi, pastoralists, over, grazing, land, led, to, livestock, theft, and, conflict, the, khoikhoi, were, ultimately, expelled, from, the, peninsula, by, force, after, a, succession, of, wars, the, first, khoikhoi, dutch, war, broke, out, in, 1659, the, second, in, 1673, and, the, third, 1674, 1677, by, the, time, of, their, defeat, and, expulsion, from, the, cape, peninsula, and, surrounding, districts, the, khoikhoi, population, was, decimated, by, a, smallpox, epidemic, introduced, by, dutch, sailors, against, which, the, khoikhoi, had, no, natural, resistance, or, indigenous, medicines, the, bantu, expansion, was, one, of, the, major, demographic, movements, in, human, prehistory, sweeping, much, of, the, african, continent, during, the, 2nd, and, 1st, millennia, bc, bantu, speaking, communities, reached, southern, africa, from, the, congo, basin, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, bc, some, groups, ancestral, to, today, s, nguni, peoples, the, zulu, xhosa, swazi, and, ndebele, preferred, to, live, near, the, eastern, coast, of, what, is, present, day, south, africa, others, now, known, as, the, sotho, tswana, peoples, tswana, pedi, and, sotho, settled, in, the, interior, on, the, plateau, known, as, the, highveld, while, today, s, venda, and, tsonga, peoples, made, their, homes, in, the, north, eastern, areas, of, present, day, south, africa, the, kingdom, of, mapungubwe, which, was, located, near, the, northern, border, of, present, day, south, africa, at, the, confluence, of, the, limpopo, and, shashe, rivers, adjacent, to, present, day, zimbabwe, and, botswana, was, the, first, indigenous, kingdom, in, southern, africa, between, ad, 900, and, 1300, it, developed, into, the, largest, kingdom, in, the, sub, continent, before, it, was, abandoned, because, of, climatic, changes, in, the, 14th, century, smiths, created, objects, of, iron, copper, and, gold, both, for, local, decorative, use, and, for, foreign, trade, the, kingdom, controlled, trade, through, the, east, african, ports, to, arabia, india, and, china, and, throughout, southern, africa, making, it, wealthy, through, the, exchange, of, gold, and, ivory, for, imports, such, as, chinese, porcelain, and, persian, glass, beads, specifics, of, the, contact, between, bantu, speakers, and, the, indigenous, khoisan, ethnic, group, remain, largely, unresearched, although, linguistic, proof, of, assimilation, exists, as, several, southern, bantu, languages, notably, xhosa, and, zulu, are, theorised, in, that, they, incorporate, many, click, consonants, from, the, khoisan, languages, as, possibilities, of, such, developing, independently, are, valid, as, well, the, portuguese, mariner, bartolomeu, dias, was, the, first, european, to, explore, the, coastline, of, south, africa, in, 1488, while, attempting, to, discover, a, trade, route, to, the, far, east, via, the, southernmost, cape, of, south, africa, which, he, named, cabo, das, tormentas, meaning, cape, of, storms, in, november, 1497, a, fleet, of, portuguese, ships, under, the, command, of, the, portuguese, mariner, vasco, da, gama, rounded, the, cape, of, good, hope, by, 16, december, the, fleet, had, passed, the, great, fish, river, on, the, east, coast, of, south, africa, where, dias, had, earlier, turned, back, da, gama, gave, the, name, natal, to, the, coast, he, was, passing, which, in, portuguese, means, christmas, da, gama, s, fleet, proceeded, northwards, to, zanzibar, and, later, sailed, eastwards, eventually, reaching, india, and, opening, the, cape, route, between, europe, and, asia, many, portuguese, words, are, still, found, along, the, coast, of, south, africa, including, saldanha, algoa, natal, agulhas, benguela, and, lucia, the, dutch, east, india, company, in, the, dutch, of, the, day, vereenigde, oostindische, compagnie, or, voc, decided, to, establish, a, permanent, settlement, at, the, cape, in, 1652, the, voc, one, of, the, major, european, trading, houses, sailing, the, spice, route, to, the, east, had, no, intention, of, colonizing, the, area, instead, wanting, only, to, establish, a, secure, base, camp, where, passing, ships, could, be, serviced, and, restock, on, supplies, to, this, end, a, small, voc, expedition, under, the, command, of, jan, van, riebeeck, reached, table, bay, on, 6, april, 1652, the, voc, had, settled, at, the, cape, in, order, to, supply, their, trading, ships, the, cape, and, the, voc, had, to, import, dutch, farmers, to, establish, farms, to, supply, the, passing, ships, as, well, as, to, supply, the, growing, voc, settlement, the, small, initial, group, of, free, burghers, as, these, farmers, were, known, steadily, increased, in, number, and, began, to, expand, their, farms, further, north, and, east, into, the, territory, of, the, khoikhoi, the, free, burghers, were, ex, voc, soldiers, and, gardeners, who, were, unable, to, return, to, holland, when, their, contracts, were, completed, with, the, voc, the, voc, also, brought, some, 71, 000, slaves, to, cape, town, from, india, indonesia, east, africa, mauritius, and, madagascar, the, majority, of, burghers, had, dutch, ancestry, and, belonged, to, the, dutch, reformed, church, but, there, were, also, some, germans, who, often, happened, to, be, lutherans, in, 1688, the, dutch, and, the, germans, were, joined, by, french, huguenots, calvinist, protestants, fleeing, religious, persecution, in, france, under, its, catholic, ruler, king, louis, xiv, van, riebeeck, considered, it, impolitic, to, enslave, the, local, khoi, and, san, aboriginals, so, the, voc, began, to, import, large, numbers, of, slaves, primarily, from, the, dutch, colonies, in, indonesia, eventually, van, riebeeck, and, the, voc, began, to, make, indentured, servants, out, of, the, khoikhoi, and, the, san, the, descendants, of, unions, between, the, dutch, settlers, and, the, khoi, san, and, malay, slaves, became, known, officially, as, the, cape, coloureds, and, the, cape, malays, respectively, a, significant, number, of, the, offspring, from, the, white, and, slave, unions, were, absorbed, into, the, local, proto, afrikaans, speaking, white, population, the, racially, mixed, genealogical, origins, of, many, so, called, white, south, africans, have, been, traced, to, interracial, unions, at, the, cape, between, the, european, occupying, population, and, imported, asian, and, african, slaves, the, indigenous, khoi, and, san, and, their, mixed, ethnicity, descendants, simon, van, der, stel, the, first, governor, of, the, dutch, settlement, famous, for, his, development, of, the, lucrative, south, african, wine, industry, was, himself, of, mixed, race, origin, in, 1787, shortly, before, the, french, revolution, a, faction, within, the, politics, of, the, dutch, republic, known, as, the, patriot, party, attempted, to, overthrow, the, regime, of, stadtholder, william, v, though, the, revolt, was, crushed, it, was, resurrected, after, the, french, invasion, of, the, netherlands, in, 1794, 1795, which, resulted, in, the, stadtholder, fleeing, the, country, the, patriot, revolutionaries, then, proclaimed, the, batavian, republic, which, was, closely, allied, to, revolutionary, france, in, response, the, stadtholder, who, had, taken, up, residence, in, england, issued, the, kew, letters, ordering, colonial, governors, to, surrender, to, the, british, the, british, then, seized, the, cape, in, 1795, to, prevent, it, from, falling, into, french, hands, the, cape, was, relinquished, back, to, the, dutch, in, 1803, in, 1805, the, british, inherited, the, cape, as, a, prize, during, the, napoleonic, wars, again, seizing, the, cape, from, the, french, controlled, kingdom, of, holland, which, had, replaced, the, batavian, republic, like, the, dutch, before, them, the, british, initially, had, little, interest, in, the, cape, colony, other, than, as, a, strategically, located, port, as, one, of, their, first, tasks, they, outlawed, the, use, of, the, dutch, language, in, 1806, with, the, view, of, converting, the, european, settlers, to, the, british, language, and, culture, the, cape, articles, of, capitulation, of, 1806, allowed, the, colony, to, retain, all, their, rights, and, privileges, which, they, have, enjoyed, hitherto, and, this, launched, south, africa, on, a, divergent, course, from, the, rest, of, the, british, empire, allowing, the, continuance, of, roman, dutch, law, british, sovereignty, of, the, area, was, recognised, at, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, the, dutch, accepting, a, payment, of, 6, million, pounds, equivalent, to, 31, 2, billion, in, 2023, for, the, colony, this, had, the, effect, of, forcing, more, of, the, dutch, colonists, to, move, or, trek, away, from, british, administrative, reach, much, later, in, 1820, the, british, authorities, persuaded, about, 5, 000, middle, class, british, immigrants, most, of, them, in, trade, to, leave, great, britain, many, of, the, 1820, settlers, eventually, settled, in, grahamstown, and, port, elizabeth, british, policy, with, regard, to, south, africa, would, vacillate, with, successive, governments, but, the, overarching, imperative, throughout, the, 19th, century, was, to, protect, the, strategic, trade, route, to, india, while, incurring, as, little, expense, as, possible, within, the, colony, this, aim, was, complicated, by, border, conflicts, with, the, boers, who, soon, developed, a, distaste, for, british, authority, colonel, robert, jacob, gordon, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, was, the, first, european, to, explore, parts, of, the, interior, while, commanding, the, dutch, garrison, at, the, renamed, cape, of, good, hope, from, 1780, to, 1795, the, four, expeditions, gordon, undertook, between, 1777, and, 1786, are, recorded, in, a, series, of, several, hundred, drawings, known, collectively, as, the, gordon, atlas, as, well, as, in, his, journals, which, were, only, discovered, in, 1964, early, relations, between, the, european, settlers, and, the, xhosa, the, first, bantu, peoples, they, met, when, they, ventured, inward, were, peaceful, however, there, was, competition, for, land, and, this, tension, led, to, skirmishes, in, the, form, of, cattle, raids, from, 1779, the, british, explorers, david, livingstone, and, william, oswell, setting, out, from, a, mission, station, in, the, northern, cape, colony, are, believed, to, have, been, the, first, white, men, to, cross, the, kalahari, desert, in, 1849, the, royal, geographical, society, later, awarded, livingstone, a, gold, medal, for, his, discovery, of, lake, ngami, in, the, desert, the, zulu, people, are, part, of, the, nguni, tribe, and, were, originally, a, minor, clan, in, what, is, today, northern, kwazulu, natal, founded, ca, 1709, by, zulu, kantombela, the, 1820s, saw, a, time, of, immense, upheaval, relating, to, the, military, expansion, of, the, zulu, kingdom, which, replaced, the, original, african, clan, system, with, kingdoms, sotho, speakers, know, this, period, as, the, difaqane, forced, migration, zulu, speakers, call, it, the, mfecane, crushing, various, theories, have, been, advanced, for, the, causes, of, the, difaqane, ranging, from, ecological, factors, to, competition, in, the, ivory, trade, another, theory, attributes, the, epicentre, of, zulu, violence, to, the, slave, trade, out, of, delgoa, bay, in, mozambique, situated, to, the, north, of, zululand, most, historians, recognise, that, the, mfecane, wasn, t, just, a, series, of, events, caused, by, the, founding, of, the, zulu, kingdom, but, rather, a, multitude, of, factors, caused, before, and, after, shaka, zulu, came, into, power, in, 1818, nguni, tribes, in, zululand, created, a, militaristic, kingdom, between, the, tugela, river, and, pongola, river, under, the, driving, force, of, shaka, kasenzangakhona, son, of, the, chief, of, the, zulu, clan, shaka, built, large, armies, breaking, from, clan, tradition, by, placing, the, armies, under, the, control, of, his, own, officers, rather, than, of, hereditary, chiefs, he, then, set, out, on, a, massive, programme, of, expansion, killing, or, enslaving, those, who, resisted, in, the, territories, he, conquered, his, impis, warrior, regiments, were, rigorously, disciplined, failure, in, battle, meant, death, the, zulu, resulted, in, the, mass, movement, of, many, tribes, who, in, turn, tried, to, dominate, those, in, new, territories, leading, to, widespread, warfare, and, waves, of, displacement, spread, throughout, southern, africa, and, beyond, it, accelerated, the, formation, of, several, new, nation, states, notably, those, of, the, sotho, present, day, lesotho, and, the, swazi, now, eswatini, formerly, swaziland, it, caused, the, consolidation, of, groups, such, as, the, matebele, the, mfengu, and, the, makololo, in, 1828, shaka, was, killed, by, his, half, brothers, dingaan, and, umhlangana, the, weaker, and, less, skilled, dingaan, became, king, relaxing, military, discipline, while, continuing, the, despotism, dingaan, also, attempted, to, establish, relations, with, the, british, traders, on, the, natal, coast, but, events, had, started, to, unfold, that, would, see, the, demise, of, zulu, independence, estimates, for, the, death, toll, resulting, from, the, mfecane, range, from, 1, million, to, 2, million, after, 1806, a, number, of, dutch, speaking, inhabitants, of, the, cape, colony, trekked, inland, first, in, small, groups, eventually, in, the, 1830s, large, numbers, of, boers, migrated, in, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, great, trek, among, the, initial, reasons, for, their, leaving, the, cape, colony, were, the, english, language, rule, religion, was, a, very, important, aspect, of, the, settlers, culture, and, the, bible, and, church, services, were, in, dutch, similarly, schools, justice, and, trade, up, to, the, arrival, of, the, british, were, all, managed, in, the, dutch, language, the, language, law, caused, friction, distrust, and, dissatisfaction, another, reason, for, dutch, speaking, white, farmers, trekking, away, from, the, cape, was, the, abolition, of, slavery, by, the, british, government, on, emancipation, day, 1, december, 1838, the, farmers, complained, they, could, not, replace, the, labour, of, their, slaves, without, losing, an, excessive, amount, of, money, the, farmers, had, invested, large, amounts, of, capital, in, slaves, owners, who, had, purchased, enslaved, people, on, credit, or, put, them, up, as, surety, against, loans, faced, financial, ruin, britain, had, allocated, the, sum, of, 1, 200, 000, british, pounds, equivalent, to, 5, 53, billion, in, 2023, as, compensation, to, the, dutch, settlers, on, condition, the, dutch, farmers, had, to, lodge, their, claims, in, britain, as, well, as, the, fact, that, the, value, of, the, enslaved, people, was, many, times, the, allocated, amount, this, caused, further, dissatisfaction, among, the, dutch, settlers, the, settlers, incorrectly, believed, that, the, cape, colony, administration, had, taken, the, money, due, to, them, as, payment, for, freeing, their, slaves, those, settlers, who, were, allocated, money, could, only, claim, it, in, britain, in, person, or, through, an, agent, the, commission, charged, by, agents, was, the, same, as, the, payment, for, one, slave, thus, those, settlers, only, claiming, for, one, slave, would, receive, nothing, the, south, african, republic, dutch, zuid, afrikaansche, republiek, or, zar, not, to, be, confused, with, the, much, later, republic, of, south, africa, is, often, referred, to, as, the, transvaal, and, sometimes, as, the, republic, of, transvaal, it, was, an, independent, and, internationally, recognised, nation, state, in, southern, africa, from, 1852, to, 1902, independent, sovereignty, of, the, republic, was, formally, recognised, by, great, britain, with, the, signing, of, the, sand, river, convention, on, 17, january, 1852, the, republic, under, the, premiership, of, paul, kruger, defeated, british, forces, in, the, first, boer, war, and, remained, independent, until, the, end, of, the, second, boer, war, on, 31, may, 1902, when, it, was, forced, to, surrender, to, the, british, the, territory, of, the, south, african, republic, became, known, after, this, war, as, the, transvaal, colony, the, independent, boer, republic, of, orange, free, state, evolved,

rivers, named, transorange, britain, due, to, the, military, burden, imposed, on, it, by, the, crimean, war, in, europe, then, withdrew, its, troops, from, the, territory, in, 1854, when, the, territory, along, with, other, areas, in, the, region, was, claimed, by, the, boers, as, an, independent, boer, republic, which, they, named, the, orange, free, state, in, march, 1858, after, land, disputes, cattle, rustling, and, a, series, of, raids, and, counter, raids, the, orange, free, state, declared, war, on, the, basotho, kingdom, which, it, failed, to, defeat, a, succession, of, wars, were, conducted, between, the, boers, and, the, basotho, for, the, next, 10, years, the, name, orange, free, state, was, again, changed, to, the, orange, river, colony, created, by, britain, after, the, latter, occupied, it, in, 1900, and, then, annexed, it, in, 1902, during, the, second, boer, war, the, colony, with, an, estimated, population, of, less, than, 400, 000, in, 1904, ceased, to, exist, in, 1910, when, it, was, absorbed, into, the, union, of, south, africa, as, the, orange, free, state, province, natalia, was, a, short, lived, boer, republic, established, in, 1839, by, boer, voortrekkers, emigrating, from, the, cape, colony, in, 1824, a, party, of, 25, men, under, british, lieutenant, f, g, farewell, arrived, from, the, cape, colony, and, established, a, settlement, on, the, northern, shore, of, the, bay, of, natal, which, would, later, become, the, port, of, durban, so, named, after, benjamin, d, urban, a, governor, of, the, cape, colony, boer, voortrekkers, in, 1838, established, the, republic, of, natalia, in, the, surrounding, region, with, its, capital, at, pietermaritzburg, on, the, night, of, 23, 24, may, 1842, british, colonial, forces, attacked, the, voortrekker, camp, at, congella, the, attack, failed, with, british, forces, then, retreating, back, to, durban, which, the, boers, besieged, a, local, trader, dick, king, and, his, servant, ndongeni, who, later, became, folk, heroes, were, able, to, escape, the, blockade, and, ride, to, grahamstown, a, distance, of, 600, km, 372, 82, miles, in, 14, days, to, raise, british, reinforcements, the, reinforcements, arrived, in, durban, 20, days, later, the, siege, was, broken, and, the, voortrekkers, retreated, the, boers, accepted, british, annexation, in, 1844, many, of, the, natalia, boers, who, refused, to, acknowledge, british, rule, trekked, over, the, drakensberg, mountains, to, settle, in, the, orange, free, state, and, transvaal, republics, between, 1847, and, 1854, harry, smith, governor, and, high, commissioner, of, the, cape, colony, annexed, territories, far, to, the, north, of, the, original, british, and, dutch, settlement, smith, s, expansion, of, the, cape, colony, resulted, in, conflict, with, disaffected, boers, in, the, orange, river, sovereignty, who, in, 1848, mounted, an, abortive, rebellion, at, boomplaats, where, the, boers, were, defeated, by, a, detachment, of, the, cape, mounted, rifles, annexation, also, precipitated, a, war, between, british, colonial, forces, and, the, indigenous, xhosa, nation, in, 1850, in, the, eastern, coastal, region, starting, from, the, mid, 1800s, the, cape, of, good, hope, which, was, then, the, largest, state, in, southern, africa, began, moving, towards, greater, independence, from, britain, in, 1854, it, was, granted, its, first, locally, elected, legislature, the, cape, parliament, in, 1872, after, a, long, political, struggle, it, attained, responsible, government, with, a, locally, accountable, executive, and, prime, minister, the, cape, nonetheless, remained, nominally, part, of, the, british, empire, even, though, it, was, self, governing, in, practice, the, cape, colony, was, unusual, in, southern, africa, in, that, its, laws, prohibited, any, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, race, and, unlike, the, boer, republics, elections, were, held, according, to, the, non, racial, cape, qualified, franchise, system, whereby, suffrage, qualifications, applied, universally, regardless, of, race, initially, a, period, of, strong, economic, growth, and, social, development, ensued, however, an, ill, informed, british, attempt, to, force, the, states, of, southern, africa, into, a, british, federation, led, to, inter, ethnic, tensions, and, the, first, boer, war, meanwhile, the, discovery, of, diamonds, around, kimberley, and, gold, in, the, transvaal, led, to, a, later, return, to, instability, particularly, because, they, fueled, the, rise, to, power, of, the, ambitious, colonialist, cecil, rhodes, as, cape, prime, minister, rhodes, curtailed, the, multi, racial, franchise, and, his, expansionist, policies, set, the, stage, for, the, second, boer, war, indian, slaves, from, the, dutch, colonies, in, india, had, been, introduced, into, the, cape, area, of, south, africa, by, the, dutch, settlers, in, 1654, by, the, end, of, 1847, following, annexation, by, britain, of, the, former, boer, republic, of, natalia, nearly, all, the, boers, had, left, their, former, republic, which, the, british, renamed, natal, the, role, of, the, boer, settlers, was, replaced, by, subsidised, british, immigrants, of, whom, 5, 000, arrived, between, 1849, and, 1851, by, 1860, with, slavery, having, been, abolished, in, 1834, and, after, the, annexation, of, natal, as, a, british, colony, in, 1843, the, british, colonists, in, natal, now, kwazulu, natal, turned, to, india, to, resolve, a, labour, shortage, as, men, of, the, local, zulu, warrior, nation, were, refusing, to, work, on, the, plantations, and, farms, established, by, the, colonists, in, that, year, the, ss, truro, arrived, in, durban, harbour, with, over, 300, indians, on, board, over, the, next, 50, years, 150, 000, more, indentured, indian, servants, and, labourers, arrived, as, well, as, numerous, free, passenger, indians, building, the, base, for, what, would, become, the, largest, indian, diasporic, community, outside, india, by, 1893, when, the, lawyer, and, social, activist, mahatma, gandhi, arrived, in, durban, indians, outnumbered, whites, in, natal, the, civil, rights, struggle, of, gandhi, s, natal, indian, congress, failed, until, the, 1994, advent, of, democracy, indians, in, south, africa, were, subject, to, most, of, the, discriminatory, laws, that, applied, to, all, non, white, inhabitants, of, the, country, by, the, late, 1700s, the, cape, colony, population, had, grown, to, include, a, large, number, of, mixed, race, so, called, coloureds, who, were, the, offspring, of, extensive, interracial, relations, between, male, dutch, settlers, khoikhoi, women, and, enslaved, women, imported, from, dutch, colonies, in, the, east, members, of, this, mixed, race, community, formed, the, core, of, what, was, to, become, the, griqua, people, under, the, leadership, of, a, former, slave, named, adam, kok, these, coloureds, or, basters, meaning, mixed, race, or, multiracial, as, they, were, named, by, the, dutch, a, word, derived, from, baster, meaning, bastard, started, trekking, northward, into, the, interior, through, what, is, today, named, northern, cape, province, the, trek, of, the, griquas, to, escape, the, influence, of, the, cape, colony, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, great, epics, of, the, 19th, century, they, were, joined, on, their, long, journey, by, a, number, of, san, and, khoikhoi, aboriginal, people, local, african, tribesmen, and, also, some, white, renegades, around, 1800, they, started, crossing, the, northern, frontier, formed, by, the, orange, river, arriving, ultimately, in, an, uninhabited, area, which, they, named, griqualand, in, 1825, a, faction, of, the, griqua, people, was, induced, by, dr, john, philip, superintendent, of, the, london, missionary, society, in, southern, africa, to, relocate, to, a, place, called, philippolis, a, mission, station, for, the, san, several, hundred, miles, southeast, of, griqualand, philip, s, intention, was, for, the, griquas, to, protect, the, missionary, station, there, against, banditti, in, the, region, and, as, a, bulwark, against, the, northward, movement, of, white, settlers, from, the, cape, colony, friction, between, the, griquas, and, the, settlers, over, land, rights, resulted, in, british, troops, being, sent, to, the, region, in, 1845, it, marked, the, beginning, of, nine, years, of, british, intervention, in, the, affairs, of, the, region, which, the, british, named, transorange, in, 1861, to, avoid, the, imminent, prospect, of, either, being, colonised, by, the, cape, colony, or, coming, into, conflict, with, the, expanding, boer, republic, of, orange, free, state, most, of, the, philippolis, griquas, embarked, on, a, further, trek, they, moved, about, 500, miles, eastward, over, the, quathlamba, today, known, as, the, drakensberg, mountain, range, settling, ultimately, in, an, area, officially, designated, as, nomansland, which, the, griquas, renamed, griqualand, east, east, griqualand, was, subsequently, annexed, by, britain, in, 1874, and, incorporated, into, the, cape, colony, in, 1879, the, original, griqualand, north, of, the, orange, river, was, annexed, by, britain, s, cape, colony, and, renamed, griqualand, west, after, the, discovery, in, 1871, of, the, world, s, richest, deposit, of, diamonds, at, kimberley, so, named, after, the, british, colonial, secretary, earl, kimberley, although, no, formally, surveyed, boundaries, existed, griqua, leader, nicolaas, waterboer, claimed, the, diamond, fields, were, situated, on, land, belonging, to, the, griquas, the, boer, republics, of, transvaal, and, the, orange, free, state, also, vied, for, ownership, of, the, land, but, britain, being, the, preeminent, force, in, the, region, won, control, over, the, disputed, territory, in, 1878, waterboer, led, an, unsuccessful, rebellion, against, the, colonial, authorities, for, which, he, was, arrested, and, briefly, exiled, in, early, south, africa, european, notions, of, national, boundaries, and, land, ownership, had, no, counterparts, in, african, political, culture, to, moshoeshoe, the, basotho, chieftain, from, lesotho, it, was, customary, tribute, in, the, form, of, horses, and, cattle, represented, acceptance, of, land, use, under, his, authority, to, european, settlers, in, southern, africa, the, same, form, of, tribute, was, believed, to, constitute, purchase, and, permanent, ownership, of, the, land, under, independent, authority, as, european, settlers, started, establishing, permanent, farms, after, trekking, across, the, country, in, search, of, prime, agricultural, land, they, encountered, resistance, from, the, local, bantu, people, who, had, originally, migrated, southwards, from, central, africa, hundreds, of, years, earlier, the, consequent, frontier, wars, became, known, as, the, xhosa, wars, which, were, also, referred, to, in, contemporary, discussion, as, the, kafir, wars, or, the, cape, frontier, wars, in, the, southeastern, part, of, south, africa, boer, settlers, and, the, xhosa, clashed, along, the, great, fish, river, and, in, 1779, the, first, xhosa, war, broke, out, for, nearly, 100, years, subsequently, the, xhosa, fought, the, settlers, sporadically, first, the, boers, or, afrikaners, and, later, the, british, in, the, fourth, xhosa, war, which, lasted, from, 1811, to, 1812, the, british, colonial, authorities, forced, the, xhosa, back, across, the, great, fish, river, and, established, forts, along, this, boundary, the, increasing, economic, involvement, of, the, british, in, southern, africa, from, the, 1820s, and, especially, following, the, discovery, of, first, diamonds, at, kimberley, and, gold, in, the, transvaal, resulted, in, pressure, for, land, and, african, labour, and, led, to, increasingly, tense, relations, with, southern, african, states, in, 1818, differences, between, two, xhosa, leaders, ndlambe, and, ngqika, ended, in, ngqika, s, defeat, but, the, british, continued, to, recognise, ngqika, as, the, paramount, chief, he, appealed, to, the, british, for, help, against, ndlambe, who, retaliated, in, 1819, during, the, fifth, frontier, war, by, attacking, the, british, colonial, town, of, grahamstown, in, the, eastern, part, of, what, is, today, south, africa, in, the, region, named, natalia, by, the, boer, trekkers, the, latter, negotiated, an, agreement, with, zulu, king, dingane, kasenzangakhona, allowing, the, boers, to, settle, in, part, of, the, then, zulu, kingdom, cattle, rustling, ensued, and, a, party, of, boers, under, the, leadership, of, piet, retief, were, killed, subsequent, to, the, killing, of, the, retief, party, the, boers, fought, against, the, zulus, at, the, ncome, river, on, 16, december, 1838, the, boers, took, a, defensive, position, with, the, high, banks, of, the, ncome, river, forming, a, natural, barrier, to, their, rear, with, their, ox, waggons, as, barricades, between, themselves, and, the, attacking, zulu, army, in, the, clash, known, historically, as, the, battle, of, blood, river, in, the, later, annexation, of, the, zulu, kingdom, by, imperial, britain, an, anglo, zulu, war, was, fought, in, 1879, following, lord, carnarvon, s, successful, introduction, of, federation, in, canada, it, was, thought, that, similar, political, effort, coupled, with, military, campaigns, might, succeed, with, the, african, kingdoms, tribal, areas, and, boer, republics, in, south, africa, in, 1874, henry, bartle, frere, was, sent, to, south, africa, as, high, commissioner, for, the, british, empire, to, bring, such, plans, into, being, among, the, obstacles, were, the, presence, of, the, independent, states, of, the, south, african, republic, and, the, kingdom, of, zululand, and, its, army, frere, on, his, own, initiative, without, the, approval, of, the, british, government, and, with, the, intent, of, instigating, a, war, with, the, zulu, had, presented, an, ultimatum, on, 11, december, 1878, to, the, zulu, king, cetshwayo, with, which, the, zulu, king, could, not, comply, bartle, frere, then, sent, lord, chelmsford, to, invade, zululand, the, war, is, notable, for, several, particularly, bloody, battles, including, an, overwhelming, victory, by, the, zulu, at, the, battle, of, isandlwana, as, well, as, for, being, a, landmark, in, the, timeline, of, imperialism, in, the, region, britain, s, eventual, defeat, of, the, zulus, marking, the, end, of, the, zulu, nation, s, independence, was, accomplished, with, the, assistance, of, zulu, collaborators, who, harboured, cultural, and, political, resentments, against, centralised, zulu, authority, the, british, then, set, about, establishing, large, sugar, plantations, in, the, area, today, named, kwazulu, natal, province, from, the, 1830s, onwards, numbers, of, white, settlers, from, the, cape, colony, crossed, the, orange, river, and, started, arriving, in, the, fertile, southern, part, of, territory, known, as, the, lower, caledon, valley, which, was, occupied, by, basotho, cattle, herders, under, the, authority, of, the, basotho, founding, monarch, moshoeshoe, i, in, 1845, a, treaty, was, signed, between, the, british, colonists, and, moshoeshoe, which, recognised, white, settlement, in, the, area, no, firm, boundaries, were, drawn, between, the, area, of, white, settlement, and, moshoeshoe, s, kingdom, which, led, to, border, clashes, moshoeshoe, was, under, the, impression, he, was, loaning, grazing, land, to, the, settlers, in, accordance, with, african, precepts, of, occupation, rather, than, ownership, while, the, settlers, believed, they, had, been, granted, permanent, land, rights, afrikaner, settlers, in, particular, were, loath, to, live, under, moshoesoe, s, authority, and, among, africans, the, british, who, at, that, time, controlled, the, area, between, the, orange, and, vaal, rivers, called, the, orange, river, sovereignty, decided, a, discernible, boundary, was, necessary, and, proclaimed, a, line, named, the, warden, line, dividing, the, area, between, british, and, basotho, territories, this, led, to, conflict, between, the, basotho, and, the, british, who, were, defeated, by, moshoeshoe, s, warriors, at, the, battle, of, viervoet, in, 1851, as, punishment, to, the, basotho, the, governor, and, commander, in, chief, of, the, cape, colony, george, cathcart, deployed, troops, to, the, mohokare, river, moshoeshoe, was, ordered, to, pay, a, fine, when, he, did, not, pay, the, fine, in, full, a, battle, broke, out, on, the, berea, plateau, in, 1852, where, the, british, suffered, heavy, losses, in, 1854, the, british, handed, over, the, territory, to, the, boers, through, the, signing, of, the, sand, river, convention, this, territory, and, others, in, the, region, then, became, the, republic, of, the, orange, free, state, a, succession, of, wars, followed, from, 1858, to, 1868, between, the, basotho, kingdom, and, the, boer, republic, of, orange, free, state, in, the, battles, that, followed, the, orange, free, state, tried, unsuccessfully, to, capture, moshoeshoe, s, mountain, stronghold, at, thaba, bosiu, while, the, sotho, conducted, raids, in, free, state, territories, both, sides, adopted, scorched, earth, tactics, with, large, swathes, of, pasturage, and, cropland, being, destroyed, faced, with, starvation, moshoeshoe, signed, a, peace, treaty, on, 15, october, 1858, though, crucial, boundary, issues, remained, unresolved, war, broke, out, again, in, 1865, after, an, unsuccessful, appeal, for, aid, from, the, british, empire, moshoeshoe, signed, the, 1866, treaty, of, thaba, bosiu, with, the, basotho, ceding, substantial, territory, to, the, orange, free, state, on, 12, march, 1868, the, british, parliament, declared, the, basotho, kingdom, a, british, protectorate, and, part, of, the, british, empire, open, hostilities, ceased, between, the, orange, free, state, and, the, basotho, the, country, was, subsequently, named, basutoland, and, is, presently, named, lesotho, in, 1836, when, boer, v, oortrekkers, pioneers, arrived, in, the, northwestern, part, of, present, day, south, africa, they, came, into, conflict, with, a, ndebele, sub, group, that, the, settlers, named, matabele, under, chief, mzilikazi, a, series, of, battles, ensued, in, which, mzilikazi, was, eventually, defeated, he, withdrew, from, the, area, and, led, his, people, northwards, to, what, would, later, become, the, matabele, region, of, southern, rhodesia, now, zimbabwe, other, members, of, the, ndebele, ethnic, language, group, in, different, areas, of, the, region, similarly, came, into, conflict, with, the, voortrekkers, notably, in, the, area, that, would, later, become, the, northern, transvaal, in, september, 1854, 28, boers, accused, of, cattle, rustling, were, killed, in, three, separate, incidents, by, an, alliance, of, the, ndebele, chiefdoms, of, mokopane, and, mankopane, mokopane, and, his, followers, anticipating, retaliation, by, the, settlers, retreated, into, the, mountain, caves, known, as, gwasa, or, makapansgat, in, afrikaans, in, late, october, boer, commandos, supported, by, local, kgatla, tribal, collaborators, laid, siege, to, the, caves, by, the, end, of, the, siege, about, three, weeks, later, mokopane, and, between, 1, 000, and, 3, 000, people, had, died, in, the, caves, the, survivors, were, captured, and, allegedly, enslaved, the, bapedi, wars, also, known, as, the, sekhukhune, wars, consisted, of, three, separate, campaigns, fought, between, 1876, and, 1879, against, the, bapedi, under, their, reigning, monarch, king, sekhukhune, i, in, the, northeastern, region, known, as, sekhukhuneland, bordering, on, swaziland, further, friction, was, caused, by, the, refusal, of, sekhukhune, to, allow, prospectors, to, search, for, gold, in, territory, he, considered, to, be, sovereign, and, independent, under, his, authority, the, first, sekhukhune, war, of, 1876, was, conducted, by, the, boers, and, the, two, separate, campaigns, of, the, second, sekhukhune, war, of, 1878, 1879, were, conducted, by, the, british, during, the, final, campaign, sekukuni, also, spelled, sekhukhune, and, members, of, his, entourage, took, refuge, in, a, mountain, cave, where, he, was, cut, off, from, food, and, water, he, eventually, surrendered, to, a, combined, deputation, of, boer, and, british, forces, on, 2, december, 1879, sekhukhune, members, of, his, family, and, some, bapedi, generals, were, subsequently, imprisoned, in, pretoria, for, two, years, with, sekhukhuneland, becoming, part, of, the, transvaal, republic, no, gold, was, ever, discovered, in, the, annexed, territory, the, first, diamond, discoveries, between, 1866, and, 1867, were, alluvial, on, the, southern, banks, of, the, orange, river, by, 1869, diamonds, were, found, at, some, distance, from, any, stream, or, river, in, hard, rock, called, blue, ground, later, called, kimberlite, after, the, mining, town, of, kimberley, where, the, diamond, diggings, were, concentrated, the, diggings, were, located, in, an, area, of, vague, boundaries, and, disputed, land, ownership, claimants, to, the, site, included, the, south, african, transvaal, republic, the, orange, free, state, republic, and, the, mixed, race, griqua, nation, under, nicolaas, waterboer, cape, colony, governor, henry, barkly, persuaded, all, claimants, to, submit, themselves, to, a, decision, of, an, arbitrator, and, so, robert, w, keate, lieutenant, governor, of, natal, was, asked, to, arbitrate, keate, awarded, ownership, to, the, griquas, waterboer, fearing, conflict, with, the, boer, republic, of, orange, free, state, subsequently, asked, for, and, received, british, protection, griqualand, then, became, a, separate, crown, colony, renamed, griqualand, west, in, 1871, with, a, lieutenant, general, and, legislative, council, the, crown, colony, of, griqualand, west, was, annexed, into, the, cape, colony, in, 1877, enacted, into, law, in, 1880, no, material, benefits, accrued, to, the, griquas, as, a, result, of, either, colonisation, or, annexation, they, did, not, receive, any, share, of, the, diamond, wealth, generated, at, kimberley, the, griqua, community, became, subsequently, dissimulated, by, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, the, mines, at, kimberley, were, producing, 95, of, the, world, s, diamonds, the, widening, search, for, gold, and, other, resources, were, financed, by, the, wealth, produced, and, the, practical, experience, gained, at, kimberley, revenue, accruing, to, the, cape, colony, from, the, kimberley, diamond, diggings, enabled, the, cape, colony, to, be, granted, responsible, government, status, in, 1872, since, it, was, no, longer, dependent, on, the, british, treasury, and, hence, allowing, it, to, be, fully, self, governing, in, similar, fashion, to, the, federation, of, canada, new, zealand, and, some, of, the, australian, states, the, wealth, derived, from, kimberley, diamond, mining, having, effectively, tripled, the, customs, revenue, of, the, cape, colony, from, 1871, to, 1875, also, doubled, its, population, and, allowed, it, to, expand, its, boundaries, and, railways, to, the, north, in, 1888, british, mining, magnate, cecil, john, rhodes, co, founded, de, beers, consolidated, mines, at, kimberley, after, buying, up, and, amalgamating, the, individual, claims, with, finance, provided, by, the, rothschild, dynasty, abundant, cheap, african, labour, was, central, to, the, success, of, kimberley, diamond, mining, as, it, would, later, also, be, to, the, success, of, gold, mining, on, the, witwatersrand, it, has, been, suggested, in, some, academic, circles, that, the, wealth, produced, at, kimberley, was, a, significant, factor, influencing, the, scramble, for, africa, in, which, european, powers, had, by, 1902, competed, with, each, other, in, drawing, arbitrary, boundaries, across, almost, the, entire, continent, and, dividing, it, among, themselves, although, many, tales, abound, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, as, to, who, first, discovered, gold, or, the, manner, in, which, it, was, originally, discovered, in, the, late, 19th, century, on, the, witwatersrand, meaning, white, waters, ridge, of, the, transvaal, the, discovery, of, gold, in, february, 1886, at, a, farm, called, langlaagte, on, the, witwatersrand, in, particular, precipitated, a, gold, rush, by, prospectors, and, fortune, seekers, from, all, over, the, world, except, in, rare, outcrops, however, the, main, gold, deposits, had, over, many, years, become, covered, gradually,

in, 1895, there, was, an, investment, boom, in, witwatersrand, gold, mining, shares, the, precious, metal, that, underpinned, international, trade, would, dominate, south, african, exports, for, decades, to, come, of, the, leading, 25, foreign, industrialists, who, were, instrumental, in, opening, up, deep, level, mining, operations, at, the, witwatersrand, gold, fields, 15, were, jewish, 11, of, the, total, were, from, germany, or, austria, and, nine, of, that, latter, category, were, also, jewish, the, commercial, opportunities, opened, by, the, discovery, of, gold, attracted, many, other, people, of, european, jewish, origin, the, jewish, population, of, south, africa, in, 1880, numbered, approximately, 4, 000, by, 1914, it, had, grown, to, more, than, 40, 000, mostly, migrants, from, lithuania, the, working, environment, of, the, mines, meanwhile, as, one, historian, has, described, it, was, dangerous, brutal, and, onerous, and, therefore, unpopular, among, local, black, africans, recruitment, of, black, labour, began, to, prove, difficult, even, with, an, offer, of, improved, wages, in, mid, 1903, there, remained, barely, half, of, the, 90, 000, black, labourers, who, had, been, employed, in, the, industry, in, mid, 1899, the, decision, was, made, to, start, importing, chinese, indentured, labourers, who, were, prepared, to, work, for, far, less, wages, than, local, african, labourers, the, first, 1, 000, indentured, chinese, labourers, arrived, in, june, 1904, by, january, 1907, 53, 000, chinese, labourers, were, working, in, the, gold, mines, the, transvaal, boer, republic, was, forcefully, annexed, by, britain, in, 1877, during, britain, s, attempt, to, consolidate, the, states, of, southern, africa, under, british, rule, long, standing, boer, resentment, turned, into, full, blown, rebellion, in, the, transvaal, and, the, first, anglo, boer, war, also, known, as, the, boer, insurrection, broke, out, in, 1880, the, conflict, ended, almost, as, soon, as, it, began, with, a, decisive, boer, victory, at, battle, of, majuba, hill, 27, february, 1881, the, republic, regained, its, independence, as, the, zuid, afrikaansche, republiek, south, african, republic, or, zar, paul, kruger, one, of, the, leaders, of, the, uprising, became, president, of, the, zar, in, 1883, meanwhile, the, british, who, viewed, their, defeat, at, majuba, as, an, aberration, forged, ahead, with, their, desire, to, federate, the, southern, african, colonies, and, republics, they, saw, this, as, the, best, way, to, come, to, terms, with, the, fact, of, a, white, afrikaner, majority, as, well, as, to, promote, their, larger, strategic, interests, in, the, area, the, cause, of, the, anglo, boer, wars, has, been, attributed, to, a, contest, over, which, nation, would, control, and, benefit, most, from, the, witwatersrand, gold, mines, the, enormous, wealth, of, the, mines, was, in, the, hands, of, european, randlords, overseeing, the, mainly, british, foreign, managers, mining, foremen, engineers, and, technical, specialists, characterised, by, the, boers, as, uitlander, meaning, aliens, the, aliens, objected, to, being, denied, parliamentary, representation, and, the, right, to, vote, and, they, complained, also, of, bureaucratic, government, delays, in, the, issuing, of, licenses, and, permits, and, general, administrative, incompetence, on, the, part, of, the, government, in, 1895, a, column, of, mercenaries, in, the, employ, of, cecil, john, rhodes, rhodesian, based, charter, company, and, led, by, captain, leander, starr, jameson, had, entered, the, zar, with, the, intention, of, sparking, an, uprising, on, the, witwatersrand, and, installing, a, british, administration, there, the, armed, incursion, became, known, as, the, jameson, raid, it, ended, when, the, invading, column, was, ambushed, and, captured, by, boer, commandos, president, kruger, suspected, the, insurgency, had, received, at, least, the, tacit, approval, of, the, cape, colony, government, under, the, premiership, of, cecil, john, rhodes, and, that, kruger, s, south, african, republic, faced, imminent, danger, kruger, reacted, by, forming, an, alliance, with, the, neighbouring, boer, republic, of, orange, free, state, this, did, not, prevent, the, outbreak, of, a, second, anglo, boer, war, renewed, tensions, between, britain, and, the, boers, peaked, in, 1899, when, the, british, demanded, voting, rights, for, the, 60, 000, foreign, whites, on, the, witwatersrand, until, that, point, president, paul, kruger, s, government, had, excluded, all, foreigners, from, the, franchise, kruger, rejected, the, british, demand, and, called, for, the, withdrawal, of, british, troops, from, the, borders, of, the, south, african, republic, when, the, british, refused, kruger, declared, war, this, second, anglo, boer, war, also, known, as, the, south, african, war, lasted, longer, than, the, first, with, british, troops, being, supplemented, by, colonial, troops, from, southern, rhodesia, canada, india, australia, and, new, zealand, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, total, number, of, british, and, colonial, troops, deployed, in, south, africa, during, the, war, outnumbered, the, population, of, the, two, boer, republics, by, more, than, 150, 000, by, june, 1900, pretoria, the, last, of, the, major, boer, towns, had, surrendered, yet, resistance, by, boer, bittereinders, meaning, those, who, would, fight, to, the, bitter, end, continued, for, two, more, years, with, guerrilla, warfare, which, the, british, met, in, turn, with, scorched, earth, tactics, the, boers, kept, on, fighting, the, british, suffragette, emily, hobhouse, visited, british, concentration, camps, in, south, africa, and, produced, a, report, condemning, the, appalling, conditions, there, by, 1902, 26, 000, boer, women, and, children, had, died, of, disease, and, neglect, in, the, camps, the, anglo, boer, war, affected, all, ethnic, groups, in, south, africa, black, people, were, recruited, or, conscripted, by, both, sides, into, working, for, them, either, as, combatants, or, non, combatants, to, sustain, the, respective, war, efforts, of, both, the, boers, and, the, british, the, official, statistics, of, blacks, killed, in, action, are, inaccurate, most, of, the, bodies, were, dumped, in, unmarked, graves, it, has, however, been, verified, that, 17, 182, black, people, died, mainly, of, diseases, in, the, cape, concentration, camps, alone, but, this, figure, is, not, accepted, historically, as, a, true, reflection, of, the, overall, numbers, concentration, camp, superintendents, did, not, always, record, the, deaths, of, black, inmates, in, the, camps, from, the, outset, of, hostilities, in, october, 1899, to, the, signing, of, peace, on, 31, may, 1902, the, war, claimed, the, lives, of, 22, 000, imperial, soldiers, and, 7, 000, republican, fighters, in, terms, of, the, peace, agreement, known, as, the, treaty, of, vereeniging, the, boer, republics, acknowledged, british, sovereignty, while, the, british, in, turn, committed, themselves, to, reconstruction, of, the, areas, under, their, control, during, the, years, immediately, following, the, anglo, boer, wars, britain, set, about, unifying, the, four, colonies, including, the, former, boer, republics, into, a, single, self, governed, country, called, the, union, of, south, africa, this, was, accomplished, after, several, years, of, negotiations, when, the, south, africa, act, 1909, consolidated, the, cape, colony, natal, transvaal, and, orange, free, state, into, one, nation, under, the, provisions, of, the, act, the, union, became, an, independent, dominion, of, the, british, empire, governed, under, a, form, of, constitutional, monarchy, with, the, british, monarch, represented, by, a, governor, general, this, status, was, affirmed, and, further, defined, at, the, 1926, imperial, conference, where, the, balfour, declaration, officially, recognized, the, dominions, including, south, africa, as, autonomous, communities, within, the, british, empire, equal, in, status, in, no, way, subordinate, one, to, another, in, any, aspect, of, their, domestic, or, external, affairs, prosecutions, before, the, courts, of, the, union, of, south, africa, were, instituted, in, the, name, of, the, crown, and,

advocating, separate, development, for, the, two, white, groups, and, independence, from, britain, dissatisfaction, with, british, influence, in, the, union, s, affairs, reached, a, climax, in, september, 1914, when, impoverished, boers, anti, british, boers, and, bitter, enders, launched, a, rebellion, the, rebellion, was, suppressed, and, at, least, one, officer, was, sentenced, to, death,

an, end, after, a, referendum, on, 5, october, 1960, in, which, a, majority, of, white, south, africans, voted, in, favour, of, unilateral, withdrawal, from, the, british, commonwealth, and, the,
