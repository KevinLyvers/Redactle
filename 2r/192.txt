roman, victory, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, also, known, as, the, military, anarchy, or, the, imperial, crisis, 235, 285, was, a, period, in, roman, history, during, which, the, roman, empire, had, nearly, collapsed, under, the, combined, pressure, of, repeated, foreign, invasions, civil, wars, and, economic, disintegration, at, the, height, of, the, crisis, the, roman, state, had, split, into, three, distinct, and, competing, polities, the, crisis, began, in, 235, with, the, assassination, of, emperor, severus, alexander, by, his, own, troops, during, the, following, years, the, empire, saw, barbarian, invasions, and, migrations, into, roman, territory, civil, wars, peasant, rebellions, and, political, instability, with, multiple, usurpers, competing, for, power, this, led, to, the, debasement, of, currency, and, a, breakdown, in, both, trade, networks, and, economic, productivity, with, the, plague, of, cyprian, contributing, to, the, disorder, roman, armies, became, more, reliant, over, time, on, the, growing, influence, of, the, barbarian, mercenaries, known, as, foederati, roman, commanders, in, the, field, although, nominally, loyal, to, the, state, became, increasingly, independent, of, rome, s, central, authority, during, the, crisis, there, were, at, least, 26, claimants, to, the, title, of, emperor, mostly, prominent, roman, army, generals, who, assumed, imperial, power, over, all, or, part, of, the, empire, the, same, number, of, men, became, accepted, by, the, roman, senate, as, emperor, during, this, period, and, so, became, legitimate, emperors, by, 268, the, empire, had, split, into, three, competing, states, the, gallic, empire, including, the, roman, provinces, of, gaul, britannia, and, briefly, hispania, the, palmyrene, empire, including, the, eastern, provinces, of, syria, palaestina, and, aegyptus, and, between, them, the, italian, centered, roman, empire, proper, the, reign, of, aurelian, 270, 275, marks, a, turning, point, in, the, crisis, period, aurelian, successfully, reunited, the, empire, by, defeating, the, two, breakaway, states, and, carried, out, a, series, of, reforms, which, helped, restore, some, measure, of, stability, to, the, roman, economy, the, crisis, is, said, to, have, ended, with, diocletian, and, his, restructuring, of, the, roman, imperial, government, economy, and, military, the, last, is, seen, as, a, pivotal, moment, in, roman, history, signaling, the, beginning, of, the, dominate, the, crisis, resulted, in, such, profound, changes, in, the, empire, s, institutions, society, economic, life, and, religion, that, it, is, increasingly, seen, by, most, historians, as, defining, the, transition, between, the, historical, periods, of, classical, antiquity, and, late, antiquity, year, of, the, six, emperors, 238, reign, of, gordian, iii, 238, 244, reign, of, philip, the, arab, 244, 249, reign, of, decius, 249, 251, reign, of, trebonianus, gallus, 251, 253, reign, of, aemilianus, 253, reign, of, valerian, and, gallienus, 253, 260, reign, of, gallienus, 260, 268, reign, of, claudius, gothicus, 268, 270, reign, of, aurelian, 270, 275, reign, of, tacitus, 275, 276, reign, of, probus, 276, 282, reign, of, carus, 282, 283, reign, of, carinus, 283, 285, the, army, required, larger, and, larger, bribes, to, remain, loyal, septimius, severus, raised, the, pay, of, legionaries, and, gave, substantial, donativum, to, the, troops, the, large, and, ongoing, increase, in, military, expenditure, caused, problems, for, all, of, his, successors, his, son, caracalla, raised, the, annual, pay, and, lavished, many, benefits, on, the, army, in, accordance, with, the, advice, of, his, father, to, keep, their, loyalty, and, considered, dividing, the, empire, into, eastern, and, western, sectors, with, his, brother, geta, to, reduce, the, conflict, in, their, co, rule, but, with, the, major, influence, of, their, mother, julia, domna, this, division, of, the, empire, was, not, possible, instead, of, warring, in, foreign, lands, the, roman, empire, was, increasingly, put, on, the, defensive, by, marauding, enemies, and, civil, wars, this, cut, off, the, essential, source, of, income, gained, from, plundering, enemy, countries, while, opening, up, the, roman, countryside, to, economic, devastation, from, looters, both, foreign, and, domestic, frequent, civil, wars, contributed, to, depletion, of, the, army, s, manpower, and, drafting, replacement, soldiers, strained, the, labour, force, further, fighting, on, multiple, fronts, increasing, size, and, pay, of, the, army, increasing, cost, of, transport, populist, bread, and, circuses, political, campaigns, inefficient, and, corrupt, tax, collection, unorganised, budgeting, and, paying, off, foreign, nations, for, peace, all, contributed, to, financial, crisis, the, emperors, responded, by, confiscating, assets, and, supplies, to, combat, the, deficit, the, situation, of, the, roman, empire, became, dire, in, 235, many, roman, legions, had, been, defeated, during, a, previous, campaign, against, germanic, peoples, raiding, across, the, borders, while, the, emperor, severus, alexander, had, been, focused, primarily, on, the, dangers, from, the, sassanid, empire, leading, his, troops, personally, the, emperor, resorted, to, diplomacy, and, accepting, tribute, to, pacify, the, germanic, chieftains, quickly, rather, than, military, conquest, according, to, herodian, this, cost, severus, alexander, the, respect, of, his, troops, who, may, have, felt, that, more, severe, punishment, was, required, for, the, tribes, that, had, intruded, on, rome, s, territory, the, troops, assassinated, severus, alexander, and, proclaimed, the, new, emperor, to, be, maximinus, thrax, commander, of, one, of, the, legions, present, maximinus, was, the, first, of, the, barracks, emperors, rulers, who, were, elevated, by, the, troops, without, having, any, political, experience, a, supporting, faction, distinguished, ancestors, or, a, hereditary, claim, to, the, imperial, throne, as, their, rule, rested, on, military, might, and, generalship, they, operated, as, warlords, reliant, on, the, army, to, maintain, power, maximinus, continued, the, campaigns, in, germania, but, struggled, to, exert, his, authority, over, the, whole, empire, the, senate, was, displeased, at, having, to, accept, a, peasant, as, emperor, this, precipitated, the, chaotic, year, of, the, six, emperors, during, which, all, of, the, original, claimants, were, killed, in, 238, a, revolt, broke, out, in, africa, led, by, gordian, i, and, gordian, ii, which, was, soon, supported, by, the, roman, senate, but, this, was, quickly, defeated, with, gordian, ii, killed, and, gordian, i, committing, suicide, the, senate, fearing, imperial, wrath, raised, two, of, their, own, as, co, emperors, pupienus, and, balbinus, with, gordian, i, s, grandson, gordian, iii, as, caesar, maximinus, marched, on, rome, but, was, assassinated, by, his, legio, ii, parthica, and, subsequently, pupienus, and, balbinus, were, murdered, by, the, praetorian, guard, in, the, following, years, numerous, generals, of, the, roman, army, fought, each, other, for, control, of, the, empire, and, neglected, their, duties, of, defending, it, from, invasion, there, were, frequent, raids, across, the, rhine, and, danube, frontier, by, foreign, tribes, including, the, carpians, goths, vandals, and, alamanni, and, attacks, from, sassanids, in, the, east, climate, changes, and, a, sea, level, rise, disrupted, the, agriculture, of, what, is, now, the, low, countries, forcing, tribes, residing, in, the, region, to, migrate, into, roman, lands, further, disruption, arose, in, 251, when, the, plague, of, cyprian, possibly, smallpox, broke, out, this, plague, caused, large, scale, death, severely, weakening, the, empire, the, situation, was, worsened, in, 260, when, the, emperor, valerian, was, captured, in, battle, by, the, sassanids, he, later, died, in, captivity, throughout, the, period, numerous, usurpers, claimed, the, imperial, throne, in, the, absence, of, a, strong, central, authority, the, empire, broke, into, three, competing, states, the, roman, provinces, of, gaul, britain, and, hispania, broke, off, to, form, the, gallic, empire, in, 260, the, eastern, provinces, of, syria, palestine, and, aegyptus, also, became, independent, as, the, palmyrene, empire, in, 267, the, remaining, provinces, centered, on, italy, stayed, under, a, single, ruler, but, now, faced, threats, on, every, side, an, invasion, of, macedonia, and, greece, by, goths, who, had, been, displaced, from, their, lands, on, the, black, sea, was, defeated, by, emperor, claudius, ii, gothicus, at, the, battle, of, naissus, in, 268, or, 269, historians, see, this, victory, as, the, turning, point, of, the, crisis, in, its, aftermath, a, series, of, tough, energetic, barracks, emperors, were, able, to, reassert, central, authority, further, victories, by, claudius, gothicus, drove, back, the, alamanni, and, recovered, hispania, from, the, gallic, empire, he, died, of, the, plague, in, 270, and, was, succeeded, by, aurelian, who, had, commanded, the, cavalry, at, naissus, aurelian, reigned, 270, 275, through, the, worst, of, the, crisis, gradually, restoring, the, empire, he, defeated, the, vandals, visigoths, palmyrene, empire, and, finally, the, remainder, of, the, gallic, empire, by, late, 274, the, roman, empire, had, been, reunited, into, a, single, entity, however, aurelian, was, assassinated, in, 275, sparking, a, further, series, of, competing, emperors, with, short, reigns, the, situation, did, not, stabilize, until, diocletian, himself, a, barracks, emperor, took, power, in, 284, more, than, a, century, would, pass, before, rome, again, lost, military, ascendancy, over, its, external, enemies, however, dozens, of, formerly, thriving, cities, especially, in, the, western, empire, had, been, ruined, their, populations, dead, or, dispersed, these, cities, could, not, be, rebuilt, due, to, the, economic, breakdown, caused, by, constant, warfare, the, economy, was, also, crippled, by, the, breakdown, in, trading, networks, and, the, debasement, of, the, currency, major, cities, and, towns, including, rome, itself, had, not, needed, fortifications, for, many, centuries, but, now, surrounded, themselves, with, thick, walls, fundamental, problems, with, the, empire, still, remained, the, right, of, imperial, succession, had, never, been, clearly, defined, which, was, a, factor, in, the, continuous, civil, wars, as, competing, factions, in, the, military, senate, and, other, parties, put, forward, their, favored, candidate, for, emperor, the, sheer, size, of, the, empire, which, had, been, an, issue, since, the, late, roman, republic, three, centuries, earlier, continued, to, make, it, difficult, for, a, single, ruler, to, effectively, counter, multiple, threats, at, the, same, time, these, continuing, problems, were, addressed, by, the, radical, reforms, of, diocletian, who, broke, the, cycle, of, usurpation, he, began, by, sharing, his, rule, with, a, colleague, then, formally, established, the, tetrarchy, of, four, co, emperors, in, 293, however, the, trend, of, civil, war, would, continue, after, the, abdication, of, diocletian, in, the, civil, wars, of, the, tetrarchy, 306, 324, until, the, rise, of, constantine, the, great, as, sole, emperor, the, empire, survived, until, 476, in, the, west, and, until, 1453, in, the, east, from, the, beginning, of, the, principate, there, were, no, clear, rules, for, the, imperial, succession, largely, because, the, empire, maintained, the, facade, of, a, republic, during, the, early, principate, the, process, for, becoming, an, emperor, relied, on, a, combination, of, proclamation, by, the, senate, popular, approval, and, acceptance, by, the, army, in, particular, the, praetorian, guard, a, family, connection, to, a, previous, emperor, was, beneficial, but, it, did, not, determine, the, issue, in, the, way, a, formal, system, of, hereditary, succession, would, from, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, onwards, there, was, sometimes, tension, between, the, senate, s, preferred, choice, and, the, army, as, the, senatorial, class, declined, in, political, influence, and, more, generals, were, recruited, from, the, provinces, this, tension, increased, whenever, the, succession, appeared, uncertain, there, was, an, incentive, for, any, general, with, support, of, a, sizable, army, to, attempt, to, seize, power, sparking, civil, war, the, most, recent, example, of, this, prior, to, the, crisis, was, the, year, of, the, five, emperors, which, resulted, in, the, victory, of, septimius, severus, after, the, overthrow, of, the, severan, dynasty, for, the, rest, of, the, 3rd, century, rome, was, ruled, by, a, series, of, generals, coming, into, power, through, frequent, civil, wars, which, devastated, the, empire, the, first, and, most, immediately, disastrous, of, the, natural, disasters, that, the, roman, empire, faced, during, the, third, century, was, the, plague, the, antonine, plague, that, preceded, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, sapped, manpower, from, roman, armies, and, proved, disastrous, for, the, roman, economy, from, 249, to, 262, the, plague, of, cyprian, devastated, the, roman, empire, to, such, a, degree, that, some, cities, such, as, the, city, of, alexandria, experienced, a, 62, decline, in, population, these, plagues, greatly, hindered, the, roman, empire, s, ability, to, ward, off, barbarian, invasions, but, also, factored, into, problems, such, as, famine, with, many, farms, becoming, abandoned, and, unproductive, a, second, and, longer, term, natural, disaster, that, took, place, during, the, third, century, was, the, increased, variability, of, weather, drier, summers, meant, less, agricultural, productivity, and, more, extreme, weather, events, led, to, agricultural, instability, this, could, also, have, contributed, to, the, increased, barbarian, pressure, on, roman, borders, as, they, too, would, have, experienced, the, detrimental, effects, of, climate, change, and, sought, to, push, inward, to, more, productive, areas, of, the, mediterranean, region, barbarian, invasions, came, in, the, wake, of, civil, war, plague, and, famine, distress, caused, in, part, by, the, changing, climate, led, various, barbarian, tribes, to, push, into, roman, territory, other, tribes, coalesced, into, more, formidable, entities, notably, the, alamanni, and, franks, or, were, pushed, out, of, their, former, territories, by, more, dangerous, peoples, such, as, the, sarmatians, the, huns, did, not, appear, west, of, the, volga, for, another, century, eventually, the, frontiers, were, stabilized, by, the, illyrian, emperors, however, barbarian, migrations, into, the, empire, continued, in, greater, and, greater, numbers, though, these, migrants, were, initially, closely, monitored, and, assimilated, later, tribes, eventually, entered, the, roman, empire, en, masse, with, their, weapons, giving, only, token, recognition, of, roman, authority, the, defensive, battles, that, rome, had, to, endure, on, the, danube, since, the, 230s, however, paled, in, comparison, to, the, threat, the, empire, faced, in, the, east, there, sassanid, persia, represented, a, far, greater, danger, to, rome, than, the, isolated, attacks, of, germanic, tribes, the, sassanids, had, in, 224, and, 226, overthrown, the, parthian, arsacids, and, the, persian, king, ardashir, i, who, also, wanted, to, prove, his, legitimacy, through, military, successes, had, already, penetrated, into, roman, territory, at, the, time, of, severus, alexander, probably, taking, the, strategically, important, cities, of, nisibis, and, carrhae, in, 235, 236, internally, the, empire, faced, hyperinflation, caused, by, years, of, coinage, devaluation, this, had, started, earlier, under, the, severan, emperors, who, enlarged, the, army, by, one, quarter, and, doubled, the, base, pay, of, legionaries, as, each, of, the, short, lived, emperors, took, power, they, needed, ways, to, raise, money, quickly, to, pay, the, military, s, accession, bonus, and, the, easiest, way, to, do, so, was, by, inflating, the, coinage, severely, a, process, made, possible, by, debasing, the, coinage, with, bronze, and, copper, this, resulted, in, runaway, rises, in, prices, and, by, the, time, diocletian, came, to, power, the, old, coinage, of, the, roman, empire, had, nearly, collapsed, some, taxes, were, collected, in, kind, and, values, often, were, notional, in, bullion, or, bronze, coinage, real, values, continued, to, be, figured, in, gold, coinage, but, the, silver, coin, the, denarius, used, for, 300, years, was, gone, 1, pound, of, gold, 40, gold, aurei, 1, 000, denarii, 4, 000, sestertii, this, currency, had, almost, no, value, by, the, end, of, the, third, century, and, trade, was, carried, out, without, retail, coinage, one, of, the, most, profound, and, lasting, effects, of, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, was, the, disruption, of, rome, s, extensive, internal, trade, network, ever, since, the, pax, romana, starting, with, augustus, the, empire, s, economy, had, depended, in, large, part, on, trade, between, mediterranean, ports, and, across, the, extensive, road, systems, to, the, empire, s, interior, merchants, could, travel, from, one, end, of, the, empire, to, the, other, in, relative, safety, within, a, few, weeks, moving, agricultural, goods, produced, in, the, provinces, to, the, cities, and, manufactured, goods, produced, by, the, great, cities, of, the, east, to, the, more, rural, provinces, large, estates, produced, cash, crops, for, export, and, used, the, resulting, revenues, to, import, food, and, urban, manufactured, goods, this, resulted, in, a, great, deal, of, economic, interdependence, among, the, empire, s, inhabitants, the, historian, henry, st, lawrence, beaufort, moss, describes, the, situation, as, it, stood, before, the, crisis, along, these, roads, passed, an, ever, increasing, traffic, not, only, of, troops, and, officials, but, of, traders, merchandise, and, even, tourists, an, interchange, of, goods, between, the, various, provinces, rapidly, developed, which, soon, reached, a, scale, unprecedented, in, the, previous, history, and, not, repeated, until, a, few, centuries, ago, metals, mined, in, the, uplands, of, western, europe, hides, fleeces, and, livestock, from, the, pastoral, districts, of, britain, spain, and, the, shores, of, the, black, sea, wine, and, oil, from, provence, and, aquitaine, timber, pitch, and, wax, from, south, russia, and, northern, anatolia, dried, fruits, from, syria, marble, from, the, aegean, coasts, and, most, important, of, all, grain, from, the, wheat, growing, districts, of, north, africa, egypt, and, the, danube, valley, for, the, needs, of, the, great, cities, all, these, commodities, under, the, influence, of, a, highly, organized, system, of, transport, and, marketing, moved, freely, from, one, corner, of, the, empire, to, the, other, with, the, onset, of, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, however, this, vast, internal, trade, network, broke, down, the, widespread, civil, unrest, made, it, no, longer, safe, for, merchants, to, travel, as, they, once, had, and, the, financial, crisis, that, struck, made, exchange, very, difficult, with, the, debased, currency, this, produced, profound, changes, that, in, many, ways, foreshadowed, the, very, decentralized, economic, character, of, the, coming, middle, ages, large, landowners, no, longer, able, to, successfully, export, their, crops, over, long, distances, began, producing, food, for, subsistence, and, local, barter, rather, than, import, manufactured, goods, from, the, empire, s, great, urban, areas, they, began, to, manufacture, many, goods, locally, often, on, their, own, estates, thus, beginning, the, self, sufficient, house, economy, that, would, become, commonplace, in, later, centuries, reaching, its, final, form, in, the, manorialism, of, the, middle, ages, the, common, free, people, of, the, roman, cities, meanwhile, began, to, move, out, into, the, countryside, in, search, of, food, and, better, protection, made, desperate, by, economic, necessity, many, of, these, former, city, dwellers, as, well, as, many, small, farmers, were, forced, to, give, up, hard, earned, basic, civil, rights, in, order, to, receive, protection, from, large, land, holders, in, doing, so, they, became, a, half, free, class, of, roman, citizen, known, as, coloni, they, were, tied, to, the, land, and, in, later, imperial, law, their, status, was, made, hereditary, this, provided, an, early, model, for, serfdom, the, origins, of, medieval, feudal, society, and, of, the, medieval, peasantry, the, decline, in, commerce, between, the, imperial, provinces, put, them, on, a, path, toward, increased, self, sufficiency, large, landowners, who, had, become, more, self, sufficient, became, less, mindful, of, rome, s, central, authority, particularly, in, the, western, empire, and, were, downright, hostile, toward, its, tax, collectors, the, measure, of, wealth, at, this, time, began, to, have, less, to, do, with, wielding, urban, civil, authority, and, more, to, do, with, controlling, large, agricultural, estates, in, rural, regions, since, this, guaranteed, access, to, the, only, economic, resource, of, real, value, agricultural, land, and, the, crops, it, produced, the, common, people, of, the, empire, lost, economic, and, political, status, to, the, land, holding, nobility, and, the, commercial, middle, classes, waned, along, with, their, trade, derived, livelihoods, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, thus, marked, the, beginning, of, a, long, gradual, process, that, would, transform, the, ancient, world, of, classical, antiquity, into, the, medieval, one, of, the, early, middle, ages, however, although, the, burdens, on, the, population, increased, especially, the, lower, strata, of, the, population, this, cannot, be, generalized, to, the, whole, empire, especially, since, living, conditions, were, not, uniform, although, the, structural, integrity, of, the, economy, suffered, from, the, military, conflicts, of, that, time, and, the, inflationary, episode, of, the, 270s, it, did, not, collapse, especially, because, of, the, complex, regional, differences, recent, research, has, shown, that, there, were, regions, that, prospered, even, further, such, as, egypt, africa, and, hispania, but, even, for, asia, minor, which, was, directly, affected, by, attacks, no, general, decline, can, be, observed, while, commerce, and, the, overall, economy, flourished, in, several, regions, with, several, provinces, not, affected, by, hostilities, other, provinces, experienced, some, serious, problems, as, evidenced, by, personal, hoards, in, the, northwestern, provinces, of, the, empire, however, there, can, be, no, talk, of, a, general, economic, crisis, throughout, the, whole, of, empire, even, the, roman, cities, began, to, change, in, character, the, large, cities, of, classical, antiquity, slowly, gave, way, to, the, smaller, walled, cities, that, became, common, in, the, middle, ages, these, changes, were, not, restricted, to, the, third, century, but, took, place, slowly, over, a, long, period, and, were, punctuated, with, many, temporary, reversals, in, spite, of, extensive, reforms, by, later, emperors, however, the, roman, trade, network, was, never, able, to, fully, recover, to, what, it, had, been, during, the, pax, romana, 27, bc, ad, 180, this, economic, decline, was, far, more, noticeable, and, important, in, the, western, part, of, the, empire, which, was, also, invaded, by, barbarian, tribes, several, times, during, the, century, hence, the, balance, of, power, clearly, shifted, eastward, during, this, period, as, evidenced, by, the, choice, of, diocletian, to, rule, from, nicomedia, in, asia, minor, putting, his, second, in, command, maximian, in, milan, this, would, have, a, considerable, impact, on, the, later, development, of, the, empire, with, a, richer, more, stable, eastern, empire, surviving, the, end, of, roman, rule, in, the, west, while, imperial, revenues, fell, imperial, expenses, rose, sharply, more, soldiers, greater, proportions, of, cavalry, and, the, ruinous, expense, of, walling, in, cities, all, added, to, the, toll, goods, and, services, previously, paid, for, by, the, government, were, now, demanded, in, addition, to, monetary, taxes, the, empire, suffered, from, a, crippling, labour, shortage, the, steady, exodus, of, both, rich, and, poor, from, the, cities, and, now, unprofitable, professions, forced, diocletian, to, use, compulsion, conscription, was, made, universal, most, trades, were, made, hereditary, and, workers, could, not, legally, leave, their, jobs, or, travel, elsewhere, to, seek, better, paying, ones, this, included, the, unwanted, middle, class, civil, service, positions, and, under, constantine, the, military, constantine, also, tried, to, provide, social, programs, for, the, poor, to, reduce, the, labour, shortage, all, the, barracks, emperors, based, their, power, on, the, military, and, on, the, soldiers, of, the, field, armies, not, on, the, praetorians, in, rome, thus, rome, lost, its, role, as, the, political, center, of, the, empire, during, the, third, century, although, it, remained, ideologically, important, in, order, to, legitimize, and, secure, their, rule, the, emperors, of, the, third, century, needed, above, all, military, successes, the, centre, of, decision, making, shifted, away, from, rome, and, to, wherever, the, emperor, was, with, his, armies, typically, in, the, east, this, led, to, the, transfer, of, the, capital, to, the, four, cities,
