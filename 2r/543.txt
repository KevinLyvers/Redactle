the, congress, of, vienna, of, 1814, 1815, was, a, series, of, international, diplomatic, meetings, to, discuss, and, agree, upon, a, possible, new, layout, of, the, european, political, and, constitutional, order, after, the, downfall, of, the, french, emperor, napoleon, bonaparte, participants, were, representatives, of, all, european, powers, other, than, the, ottoman, empire, and, other, stakeholders, the, congress, was, chaired, by, austrian, statesman, klemens, von, metternich, and, was, held, in, vienna, from, september, 1814, to, june, 1815, the, objective, of, the, congress, was, to, provide, a, long, term, peace, plan, for, europe, by, settling, critical, issues, arising, from, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, the, napoleonic, wars, through, negotiation, the, goal, was, not, simply, to, restore, old, boundaries, but, to, resize, the, main, powers, so, they, could, balance, each, other, and, remain, at, peace, being, at, the, same, time, shepherds, for, the, smaller, powers, more, generally, conservative, leaders, like, metternich, also, sought, to, restrain, or, eliminate, republican, liberal, and, revolutionary, movements, which, from, their, point, of, view, had, upended, the, constitutional, order, of, the, european, ancien, r, gime, at, the, negotiation, table, the, position, of, france, was, weak, in, relation, to, that, of, britain, prussia, austria, and, russia, partly, due, to, the, military, strategy, of, its, leader, napoleon, bonaparte, over, the, previous, two, decades, and, his, recent, defeat, in, the, settlement, the, parties, did, reach, france, had, to, give, up, all, recent, conquests, while, the, other, three, main, powers, made, major, territorial, gains, around, the, world, prussia, added, territory, from, smaller, states, swedish, pomerania, most, of, the, kingdom, of, saxony, and, the, western, part, of, the, former, duchy, of, warsaw, austria, gained, much, of, northern, italy, russia, added, the, central, and, eastern, parts, of, the, duchy, of, warsaw, all, agreed, upon, ratifying, the, creation, of, the, new, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, which, had, been, created, just, months, before, from, formerly, austrian, territory, and, would, serve, as, a, buffer, between, the, german, confederation, and, france, the, immediate, background, was, napoleonic, france, s, defeat, and, surrender, in, may, 1814, which, brought, an, end, to, 23, years, of, nearly, continuous, war, remarkably, negotiations, continued, unaffected, despite, the, outbreak, of, fighting, triggered, by, napoleon, s, return, from, exile, and, resumption, of, power, in, france, during, the, hundred, days, of, march, to, july, 1815, the, congress, s, agreement, was, signed, nine, days, before, napoleon, s, final, defeat, at, waterloo, on, 18, june, 1815, some, historians, have, criticised, the, outcomes, of, the, congress, for, causing, the, subsequent, suppression, of, national, democratic, and, liberal, movements, and, it, has, been, seen, as, a, reactionary, settlement, for, the, benefit, of, traditional, monarchs, others, have, praised, the, congress, for, protecting, europe, from, large, and, widespread, wars, for, almost, a, century, the, name, congress, of, vienna, was, not, meant, to, suggest, a, formal, plenary, session, but, rather, the, creation, of, a, diplomatic, organizational, framework, bringing, together, stakeholders, of, all, flocks, to, enable, the, expression, of, opinions, interests, and, sentiments, and, facilitate, discussion, of, general, issues, among, them, the, congress, format, had, been, developed, by, austrian, foreign, minister, klemens, von, metternich, assisted, by, friedrich, von, gentz, and, was, the, first, occasion, in, history, where, on, a, continental, scale, national, representatives, and, other, stakeholders, came, together, in, one, city, at, the, same, time, to, discuss, and, formulate, the, conditions, and, provisions, of, treaties, before, the, congress, of, vienna, the, common, method, of, diplomacy, involved, the, exchange, of, notes, sent, back, and, forth, among, the, several, capitals, and, separate, talks, in, different, places, a, cumbersome, process, that, required, much, in, the, way, of, time, and, transportation, the, format, set, at, the, congress, of, vienna, would, serve, as, inspiration, for, the, 1856, peace, conference, brokered, by, france, the, congress, of, paris, that, settled, the, crimean, war, the, congress, of, vienna, settlement, gave, birth, to, the, concert, of, europe, an, international, political, doctrine, that, emphasized, the, maintaining, of, political, boundaries, the, balance, of, powers, and, respecting, spheres, of, influence, and, which, guided, foreign, policy, among, the, nations, of, europe, until, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1914, to, reach, amiable, consensus, among, the, many, different, nations, holding, great, interest, in, the, settlement, proceedings, informal, face, to, face, deliberative, sessions, were, held, where, opinions, and, proposed, solutions, could, be, inventoried, the, policy, work, on, which, the, concert, of, europe, was, built, on, came, about, through, closed, doors, dealing, among, the, five, great, powers, austria, britain, russia, prussia, and, france, the, first, four, of, the, five, dominant, peacemakers, held, sway, simply, because, they, brought, to, the, table, negotiating, power, that, came, of, hard, won, victory, in, the, napoleonic, wars, france, enjoyed, her, advantageous, position, largely, through, the, brilliant, diplomatic, maneuvering, by, senior, statesman, talleyrand, lesser, powers, like, spain, sweden, and, portugal, were, given, few, opportunities, to, advocate, their, interests, and, only, occasionally, partook, in, the, meetings, held, between, the, great, powers, however, because, all, representatives, were, gathered, in, one, city, it, was, relatively, easy, to, communicate, to, hear, and, spread, news, and, gossip, and, to, present, points, of, view, for, both, powerful, and, less, powerful, nations, also, of, great, importance, to, the, parties, convened, in, vienna, were, the, opportunities, presented, at, wine, and, dinner, functions, to, establish, formal, relationships, with, one, another, and, build, up, diplomatic, networks, the, treaty, of, chaumont, in, 1814, had, reaffirmed, decisions, that, had, been, made, already, and, that, would, be, ratified, by, the, more, important, congress, of, vienna, they, included, the, establishment, of, a, confederated, germany, the, division, of, italy, into, independent, states, the, restoration, of, the, bourbon, kings, of, spain, and, the, enlargement, of, the, netherlands, to, include, what, in, 1830, became, modern, belgium, the, treaty, of, chaumont, became, the, cornerstone, of, the, european, alliance, that, formed, the, balance, of, power, for, decades, other, partial, settlements, had, already, occurred, at, the, treaty, of, paris, between, france, and, the, sixth, coalition, and, the, treaty, of, kiel, that, covered, issues, raised, regarding, scandinavia, the, treaty, of, paris, had, determined, that, a, general, congress, should, be, held, in, vienna, and, that, invitations, would, be, issued, to, all, the, powers, engaged, on, either, side, in, the, present, war, the, opening, was, scheduled, for, july, 1814, the, congress, functioned, through, formal, meetings, such, as, working, groups, and, official, diplomatic, functions, however, a, large, portion, of, the, congress, was, conducted, informally, at, salons, banquets, and, balls, four, great, powers, had, previously, formed, the, core, of, the, sixth, coalition, a, covenant, of, nations, allied, in, the, war, against, france, on, the, verge, of, napoleon, s, defeat, they, had, outlined, their, common, position, in, the, treaty, of, chaumont, march, 1814, and, negotiated, the, treaty, of, paris, 1814, with, the, bourbons, during, their, restoration, these, parties, had, not, been, part, of, the, chaumont, agreement, but, had, joined, the, treaty, of, paris, 1814, virtually, every, state, in, europe, had, a, delegation, in, vienna, more, than, 200, states, and, princely, houses, were, represented, at, the, congress, in, addition, there, were, representatives, of, cities, corporations, religious, organizations, for, instance, abbeys, and, special, interest, groups, e, g, a, delegation, representing, german, publishers, demanding, a, copyright, law, and, freedom, of, the, press, with, them, came, a, host, of, courtiers, secretaries, civil, servants, and, ladies, to, enjoy, the, magnificent, social, life, of, the, austrian, court, the, congress, was, noted, for, its, lavish, entertainment, according, to, a, famous, joke, of, an, attendee, it, danced, a, lot, but, did, not, move, forward, on, the, other, hand, the, possibilities, for, informal, gatherings, created, by, this, side, program, may, have, helped, ensure, the, congress, s, success, initially, the, representatives, of, the, four, victorious, powers, hoped, to, exclude, the, french, from, serious, participation, in, the, negotiations, but, talleyrand, skillfully, managed, to, insert, himself, into, her, inner, councils, in, the, first, weeks, of, negotiations, he, allied, himself, to, a, committee, of, eight, lesser, powers, including, spain, sweden, and, portugal, to, control, the, negotiations, once, talleyrand, was, able, to, use, this, committee, to, make, himself, a, part, of, the, inner, negotiations, he, then, left, it, once, again, abandoning, his, allies, the, major, allies, indecision, on, how, to, conduct, their, affairs, without, provoking, a, united, protest, from, the, lesser, powers, led, to, the, calling, of, a, preliminary, conference, on, the, protocol, to, which, talleyrand, and, the, marquess, of, labrador, spain, s, representative, were, invited, on, 30, september, 1814, congress, secretary, friedrich, von, gentz, reported, the, intervention, of, talleyrand, and, labrador, has, hopelessly, upset, all, our, plans, talleyrand, protested, against, the, procedure, we, have, adopted, and, soundly, rated, us, for, two, hours, it, was, a, scene, i, shall, never, forget, the, embarrassed, representatives, of, the, allies, replied, that, the, document, concerning, the, protocol, they, had, arranged, actually, meant, nothing, if, it, means, so, little, why, did, you, sign, it, snapped, labrador, talleyrand, s, policy, directed, as, much, by, national, as, personal, ambitions, demanded, the, close, but, by, no, means, amicable, relationship, he, had, with, labrador, whom, talleyrand, regarded, with, disdain, labrador, later, remarked, of, talleyrand, that, cripple, unfortunately, is, going, to, vienna, talleyrand, skirted, additional, articles, suggested, by, labrador, he, had, no, intention, of, handing, over, the, 12, 000, afrancesados, spanish, fugitives, sympathetic, to, france, who, had, sworn, fealty, to, joseph, bonaparte, nor, the, bulk, of, the, documents, paintings, pieces, of, fine, art, and, books, that, had, been, looted, from, the, archives, palaces, churches, and, cathedrals, of, spain, the, most, complex, topic, at, the, congress, was, the, polish, saxon, crisis, russia, wanted, most, of, poland, and, prussia, wanted, all, of, saxony, whose, king, had, allied, with, napoleon, the, tsar, would, like, to, become, king, of, poland, austria, analysed, this, could, make, russia, too, powerful, a, view, which, was, supported, by, britain, the, result, was, a, deadlock, for, which, talleyrand, proposed, a, solution, admit, france, to, the, inner, circle, and, france, would, support, austria, and, britain, the, three, nations, signed, a, treaty, on, 3, january, 1815, among, only, the, three, of, them, agreeing, to, go, to, war, against, russia, and, prussia, if, necessary, to, prevent, the, russo, prussian, plan, from, coming, to, fruition, when, the, tsar, heard, of, the, treaty, he, agreed, to, a, compromise, that, satisfied, all, parties, on, 24, october, 1815, russia, received, most, of, the, napoleonic, duchy, of, warsaw, as, a, kingdom, of, poland, called, congress, poland, with, the, tsar, as, a, king, ruling, it, independently, of, russia, however, the, majority, of, greater, poland, and, kuyavia, as, well, as, the, che, mno, land, were, given, to, prussia, and, mostly, included, within, the, newly, formed, grand, duchy, of, posen, pozna, while, krak, w, became, a, free, city, as, a, shared, protectorate, of, austria, prussia, and, russia, furthermore, the, tsar, was, forbidden, from, uniting, his, new, realm, with, the, parts, of, poland, that, had, been, incorporated, into, russia, in, the, 1790s, prussia, received, 60, percent, of, saxony, much, of, which, became, part, of, the, new, province, of, saxony, from, 1816, the, now, prussian, parts, of, lower, lusatia, and, some, other, areas, instead, became, part, of, the, province, of, brandenburg, with, prussian, upper, lusatia, becoming, part, of, the, province, of, silesia, by, 1825, the, remainder, of, saxony, returned, to, king, frederick, augustus, i, as, his, kingdom, of, saxony, it, can, be, learned, from, the, diaries, of, the, master, of, affairs, von, gentz, that, diplomatic, tactics, possibly, included, bribing, he, notes, that, at, the, congress, he, received, 22, 000, through, talleyrand, from, louis, xviii, while, castlereagh, gave, him, 600, accompanied, by, les, plus, folles, promesses, the, wildest, promises, his, diary, is, full, of, such, entries, the, final, act, embodying, all, the, separate, treaties, was, signed, on, 9, june, 1815, nine, days, before, the, battle, of, waterloo, its, provisions, included, representatives, of, austria, france, portugal, prussia, russia, sweden, norway, and, britain, signed, the, final, act, spain, did, not, sign, but, ratified, the, outcome, in, 1817, subsequently, ferdinand, iv, the, bourbon, king, of, sicily, regained, control, of, the, kingdom, of, naples, after, joachim, murat, the, king, installed, by, bonaparte, supported, napoleon, in, the, hundred, days, and, started, the, 1815, neapolitan, war, by, attacking, austria, the, congress, s, principal, results, apart, from, its, confirmation, of, france, s, loss, of, the, territories, annexed, between, 1795, and, 1810, which, had, already, been, settled, by, the, treaty, of, paris, were, the, enlargement, of, russia, which, gained, most, of, the, duchy, of, warsaw, and, prussia, which, acquired, the, district, of, pozna, swedish, pomerania, westphalia, and, the, northern, rhineland, the, consolidation, of, germany, from, the, nearly, 300, states, of, the, holy, roman, empire, dissolved, in, 1806, into, a, much, less, complex, system, of, thirty, nine, states, 4, of, which, were, free, cities, was, confirmed, these, states, formed, a, loose, german, confederation, under, the, leadership, of, austria, representatives, at, the, congress, agreed, to, numerous, other, territorial, changes, by, the, treaty, of, kiel, norway, had, been, ceded, by, the, king, of, denmark, norway, to, the, king, of, sweden, this, sparked, the, nationalist, movement, which, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, kingdom, of, norway, on, 17, may, 1814, and, the, subsequent, personal, union, with, sweden, austria, gained, lombardy, venetia, in, northern, italy, while, much, of, the, rest, of, north, central, italy, went, to, habsburg, dynasties, the, grand, duchy, of, tuscany, the, duchy, of, modena, and, the, duchy, of, parma, the, papal, states, were, restored, to, the, pope, the, kingdom, of, piedmont, sardinia, was, restored, to, its, mainland, possessions, and, also, gained, control, of, the, republic, of, genoa, in, southern, italy, napoleon, s, brother, in, law, joachim, murat, was, originally, allowed, to, retain, his, kingdom, of, naples, but, his, support, of, napoleon, in, the, hundred, days, led, to, the, restoration, of, the, bourbon, ferdinand, iv, to, the, throne, a, large, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, was, formed, for, the, prince, of, orange, including, both, the, old, united, provinces, and, the, formerly, austrian, ruled, territories, in, the, southern, netherlands, which, gave, way, to, the, formation, of, a, democratic, state, formally, headed, by, a, monarch, constitutional, monarchy, other, less, important, territorial, adjustments, included, significant, territorial, gains, for, the, german, kingdoms, of, hanover, which, gained, east, frisia, from, prussia, and, various, other, territories, in, northwest, germany, and, bavaria, which, gained, the, rhenish, palatinate, and, territories, in, franconia, the, duchy, of, lauenburg, was, transferred, from, hanover, to, denmark, and, prussia, annexed, swedish, pomerania, switzerland, was, enlarged, and, swiss, neutrality, was, established, swiss, mercenaries, had, played, a, significant, role, in, european, wars, for, several, hundred, years, the, congress, intended, to, put, a, stop, to, these, activities, permanently, during, the, wars, portugal, had, lost, its, town, of, olivenza, to, spain, and, moved, to, have, it, restored, portugal, is, historically, britain, s, oldest, ally, and, with, british, support, succeeded, in, having, the, re, incorporation, of, olivenza, decreed, in, article, cv, of, the, general, treaty, of, the, final, act, which, stated, that, the, powers, recognizing, the, justice, of, the, claims, of, portugal, and, the, brazils, upon, the, town, of, olivenza, and, the, other, territories, ceded, to, spain, by, the, treaty, of, badajoz, of, 1801, portugal, ratified, the, final, act, in, 1815, but, spain, would, not, sign, and, this, became, the, most, important, hold, out, against, the, congress, of, vienna, deciding, in, the, end, that, it, was, better, to, become, part, of, europe, than, to, stand, alone, spain, finally, accepted, the, treaty, on, 7, may, 1817, however, olivenza, and, its, surroundings, were, never, returned, to, portuguese, control, and, to, the, present, day, this, issue, remains, unresolved, the, united, kingdom, received, parts, of, the, west, indies, at, the, expense, of, the, netherlands, and, spain, and, kept, the, former, dutch, colonies, of, ceylon, and, the, cape, colony, as, well, as, malta, and, heligoland, under, the, treaty, of, paris, 1814, article, viii, france, ceded, to, britain, the, islands, of, tobago, and, saint, lucia, and, of, the, isle, of, france, and, its, dependencies, especially, rodrigues, and, les, seychelles, and, under, the, treaty, between, great, britain, and, austria, prussia, and, russia, respecting, the, ionian, islands, signed, in, paris, on, 5, november, 1815, as, one, of, the, treaties, signed, during, the, peace, of, paris, 1815, britain, obtained, a, protectorate, over, the, united, states, of, the, ionian, islands, the, congress, of, vienna, has, been, criticized, by, 19th, century, and, more, recent, historians, and, politicians, for, ignoring, national, and, liberal, impulses, and, for, imposing, a, stifling, reaction, on, the, continent, it, was, an, integral, part, in, what, became, known, as, the, conservative, order, in, which, democracy, and, civil, rights, associated, with, the, american, and, french, revolutions, were, de, emphasized, in, the, 20th, century, however, historians, and, politicians, looking, backward, came, to, praise, the, congress, as, well, because, they, saw, it, did, prevent, another, widespread, european, war, for, nearly, 100, years, 1815, 1914, and, a, significant, step, in, the, transition, to, a, new, international, order, in, which, peace, was, largely, maintained, through, diplomatic, dialogue, among, these, is, henry, kissinger, who, in, 1954, wrote, his, doctoral, dissertation, a, world, restored, on, it, and, paul, schroeder, historian, and, jurist, mark, jarrett, argues, that, the, diplomatic, congress, format, marked, the, true, beginning, of, our, modern, era, to, his, analyses, the, congress, organisation, was, deliberate, conflict, management, and, was, the, first, genuine, attempt, to, create, an, international, order, based, upon, consensus, rather, than, conflict, europe, was, ready, jarrett, states, to, accept, an, unprecedented, degree, of, international, cooperation, in, response, to, the, french, revolution, historian, paul, schroeder, argues, that, the, old, formulae, for, balance, of, power, were, in, fact, highly, destabilizing, and, predatory, he, says, the, congress, of, vienna, avoided, them, and, instead, set, up, rules, that, produced, a, stable, and, benign, equilibrium, the, congress, of, vienna, was, the, first, of, a, series, of, international, meetings, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, concert, of, europe, which, was, an, attempt, to, forge, a, peaceful, balance, of, power, in, europe, it, served, as, a, model, for, later, organizations, such, as, the, league, of, nations, in, 1919, and, the, united, nations, in, 1945, before, the, opening, of, the, paris, peace, conference, of, 1918, the, british, foreign, office, commissioned, a, history, of, the, congress, of, vienna, to, serve, as, an, example, to, its, own, delegates, of, how, to, achieve, an, equally, successful, peace, besides, the, main, decisions, of, the, congress, were, made, by, the, four, great, powers, and, not, all, the, countries, of, europe, could, extend, their, rights, at, the, congress, the, italian, peninsula, became, a, mere, geographical, expression, as, divided, into, seven, parts, lombardy, venetia, modena, naples, sicily, parma, piedmont, sardinia, tuscany, and, the, papal, states, under, the, control, of, different, powers, poland, remained, partitioned, between, russia, prussia, and, austria, with, the, largest, part, the, newly, created, kingdom, of, poland, remaining, under, russian, control, the, arrangements, made, by, the, four, great, powers, sought, to, ensure, future, disputes, would, be, settled, in, a, manner, that, would, avoid, the, terrible, wars, of, the, previous, 20, years, although, the, congress, of, vienna, preserved, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, it, could, not, check, the, spread, of, revolutionary, movements, across, the, continent, some, 30, years, later, some, authors, have, suggested, that, the, congress, of, vienna, may, provide, a, model, for, settling, multiple, interlocking, conflicts, in, eastern, europe, that, arose, after, the, break, up, of, the, soviet, union, 48, 12, 31, n, 16, 21, 50, e, 48, 2085, n, 16, 3638, e, 48, 2085, 16, 3638
