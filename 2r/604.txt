great, zimbabwe, is, a, medieval, city, in, the, south, eastern, hills, of, the, modern, country, of, zimbabwe, near, lake, mutirikwe, and, the, town, of, masvingo, it, was, the, capital, of, the, kingdom, of, zimbabwe, from, the, 13th, century, having, been, settled, in, the, 4th, century, ad, construction, on, the, city, began, in, the, 11th, century, and, continued, until, it, was, abandoned, in, the, 15th, century, the, edifices, were, erected, by, ancestors, of, the, shona, people, currently, located, in, zimbabwe, and, nearby, countries, the, stone, city, spans, an, area, of, 7, 22, square, kilometres, 2, 79, sq, mi, and, could, have, housed, up, to, 18, 000, people, at, its, peak, giving, it, a, population, density, of, approximately, 2, 500, inhabitants, per, square, kilometre, 6, 500, sq, mi, it, is, recognised, as, a, world, heritage, site, by, unesco, great, zimbabwe, is, believed, to, have, served, as, a, royal, palace, for, the, local, monarch, as, such, it, would, have, been, used, as, the, seat, of, political, power, among, the, edifice, s, most, prominent, features, were, its, walls, some, of, which, are, 11, metres, 36, ft, high, they, were, constructed, of, dry, stone, that, is, without, mortar, eventually, the, city, was, abandoned, and, fell, into, ruin, the, earliest, document, mentioning, the, great, zimbabwe, ruins, was, in, 1531, by, vicente, pegado, captain, of, the, portuguese, garrison, of, sofala, on, the, coast, of, modern, day, mozambique, who, recorded, it, as, symbaoe, the, first, confirmed, visits, by, europeans, were, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, investigations, of, the, site, starting, in, 1871, some, later, studies, of, the, monument, were, controversial, as, the, white, government, of, rhodesia, pressured, archeologists, to, deny, its, construction, by, black, africans, great, zimbabwe, has, since, been, adopted, as, a, national, monument, by, the, zimbabwean, government, and, the, modern, independent, state, was, named, after, it, the, word, great, distinguishes, the, site, from, the, many, smaller, ruins, now, known, as, zimbabwes, spread, across, the, zimbabwe, highveld, there, are, 200, such, sites, in, southern, africa, such, as, bumbusi, in, zimbabwe, and, manyikeni, in, mozambique, with, monumental, mortarless, walls, zimbabwe, is, the, shona, name, of, the, ruins, first, recorded, in, 1531, by, vicente, pegado, captain, of, the, portuguese, garrison, of, sofala, pegado, noted, that, the, natives, of, the, country, call, these, edifices, symbaoe, which, according, to, their, language, signifies, court, the, name, contains, dzimba, the, shona, term, for, houses, there, are, two, theories, for, the, etymology, of, the, name, the, first, proposes, that, the, word, is, derived, from, dzimba, dze, mabwe, translated, from, shona, as, large, houses, of, stone, dzimba, plural, of, imba, house, mabwe, plural, of, bwe, stone, a, second, suggests, that, zimbabwe, is, a, contracted, form, of, dzimba, hwe, which, means, venerated, houses, in, the, zezuru, dialect, of, shona, as, usually, applied, to, the, houses, or, graves, of, chiefs, the, majority, of, scholars, believe, that, it, was, built, by, members, of, the, gokomere, culture, who, were, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, shona, in, zimbabwe, the, great, zimbabwe, area, was, settled, by, the, 4th, century, ad, between, the, 4th, and, the, 7th, centuries, communities, of, the, gokomere, or, ziwa, cultures, farmed, the, valley, and, mined, and, worked, iron, but, built, no, stone, structures, these, are, the, earliest, iron, age, settlements, in, the, area, identified, from, archaeological, diggings, construction, of, the, stone, buildings, started, in, the, 11th, century, and, continued, for, over, 300, years, the, ruins, at, great, zimbabwe, are, some, of, the, oldest, and, largest, structures, located, in, southern, africa, and, are, the, second, oldest, after, nearby, mapungubwe, in, south, africa, its, most, formidable, edifice, commonly, referred, to, as, the, great, enclosure, has, walls, as, high, as, 11, m, 36, ft, extending, approximately, 250, m, 820, ft, david, beach, believes, that, the, city, and, its, proposed, state, the, kingdom, of, zimbabwe, flourished, from, 1200, to, 1500, although, a, somewhat, earlier, date, for, its, demise, is, implied, by, a, description, transmitted, in, the, early, 16th, century, to, jo, o, de, barros, its, growth, has, been, linked, to, the, decline, of, mapungubwe, from, around, 1300, due, to, climatic, change, or, the, greater, availability, of, gold, in, the, hinterland, of, great, zimbabwe, traditional, estimates, are, that, great, zimbabwe, had, as, many, as, 18, 000, inhabitants, at, its, peak, however, a, more, recent, survey, concluded, that, the, population, likely, never, exceeded, 10, 000, the, ruins, that, survive, are, built, entirely, of, stone, they, span, 730, ha, 1, 800, acres, in, 1531, vicente, pegado, captain, of, the, portuguese, garrison, of, sofala, described, zimbabwe, thus, among, the, gold, mines, of, the, inland, plains, between, the, limpopo, and, zambezi, rivers, there, is, a, fortress, built, of, stones, of, marvelous, size, and, there, appears, to, be, no, mortar, joining, them, this, edifice, is, almost, surrounded, by, hills, upon, which, are, others, resembling, it, in, the, fashioning, of, stone, and, the, absence, of, mortar, and, one, of, them, is, a, tower, more, than, 12, fathoms, high, the, natives, of, the, country, call, these, edifices, symbaoe, which, according, to, their, language, signifies, court, the, ruins, form, three, distinct, architectural, groups, they, are, known, as, the, hill, complex, the, valley, complex, and, the, great, enclosure, the, hill, complex, is, the, oldest, and, was, occupied, from, the, 11th, to, 13th, centuries, the, great, enclosure, was, occupied, from, the, 13th, to, 15th, centuries, and, the, valley, complex, from, the, 14th, to, 16th, centuries, notable, features, of, the, hill, complex, include, the, eastern, enclosure, in, which, it, is, thought, the, zimbabwe, birds, stood, a, high, balcony, enclosure, overlooking, the, eastern, enclosure, and, a, huge, boulder, in, a, shape, similar, to, that, of, the, zimbabwe, bird, the, great, enclosure, is, composed, of, an, inner, wall, encircling, a, series, of, structures, and, a, younger, outer, wall, the, conical, tower, 5, 5, m, 18, ft, in, diameter, and, 9, m, 30, ft, high, was, constructed, between, the, two, walls, the, valley, complex, is, divided, into, the, upper, and, lower, valley, ruins, with, different, periods, of, occupation, there, are, different, archaeological, interpretations, of, these, groupings, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, complexes, represent, the, work, of, successive, kings, some, of, the, new, rulers, founded, a, new, residence, the, focus, of, power, moved, from, the, hill, complex, in, the, 12th, century, to, the, great, enclosure, the, upper, valley, and, finally, the, lower, valley, in, the, early, 16th, century, the, alternative, structuralist, interpretation, holds, that, the, different, complexes, had, different, functions, the, hill, complex, as, an, area, for, rituals, perhaps, related, to, rain, making, the, valley, complex, was, for, the, citizens, and, the, great, enclosure, was, used, by, the, king, structures, that, were, more, elaborate, were, probably, built, for, the, kings, although, it, has, been, argued, that, the, dating, of, finds, in, the, complexes, does, not, support, this, interpretation, the, most, important, artefacts, recovered, from, the, monument, are, the, eight, zimbabwe, birds, these, were, carved, from, a, micaceous, schist, soapstone, on, the, tops, of, monoliths, the, height, of, a, person, slots, in, a, platform, in, the, eastern, enclosure, of, the, hill, complex, appear, designed, to, hold, the, monoliths, with, the, zimbabwe, birds, but, as, they, were, not, found, in, situ, the, original, location, of, each, monolith, and, bird, within, the, enclosure, cannot, be, determined, other, artefacts, include, soapstone, figurines, one, of, which, is, in, the, british, museum, pottery, iron, gongs, elaborately, worked, ivory, iron, and, copper, wire, iron, hoes, bronze, spearheads, copper, ingots, and, crucibles, and, gold, beads, bracelets, pendants, and, sheaths, glass, beads, and, porcelain, from, china, and, persia, among, other, foreign, artefacts, were, also, found, attesting, the, international, trade, linkages, of, the, kingdom, in, the, extensive, stone, ruins, of, the, great, city, which, still, remain, today, include, eight, monolithic, birds, carved, in, soapstone, it, is, thought, that, they, represent, the, bateleur, eagle, a, good, omen, protective, spirit, and, messenger, of, the, gods, in, shona, culture, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, great, zimbabwe, became, a, centre, for, trading, with, artefacts, suggesting, that, the, city, formed, part, of, a, trade, network, linked, to, kilwa, and, extending, as, far, as, china, copper, coins, found, at, kilwa, kisiwani, appear, to, be, of, the, same, pure, ore, found, on, the, swahili, coast, this, international, trade, was, mainly, in, gold, and, ivory, that, international, commerce, was, in, addition, to, the, local, agricultural, trade, in, which, cattle, were, especially, important, the, large, cattle, herd, that, supplied, the, city, moved, seasonally, and, was, managed, by, the, court, chinese, pottery, shards, coins, from, arabia, glass, beads, and, other, non, local, items, have, been, excavated, at, zimbabwe, despite, these, strong, international, trade, links, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, exchange, of, architectural, concepts, between, great, zimbabwe, and, centres, such, as, kilwa, the, causes, for, the, decline, and, ultimate, abandonment, of, the, site, around, 1450, have, been, suggested, as, due, to, a, decline, in, trade, compared, to, sites, further, north, the, exhaustion, of, the, gold, mines, political, instability, and, famine, and, water, shortages, induced, by, climatic, change, the, mutapa, state, arose, in, the, 15th, century, from, the, northward, expansion, of, the, great, zimbabwe, tradition, having, been, founded, by, nyatsimba, mutota, from, great, zimbabwe, after, he, was, sent, to, find, new, sources, of, salt, in, the, north, this, supports, the, belief, that, great, zimbabwe, s, decline, was, due, to, a, shortage, of, resources, great, zimbabwe, also, predates, the, khami, and, nyanga, cultures, the, first, european, visit, may, have, been, made, by, the, portuguese, traveler, ant, nio, fernandes, in, 1513, 1515, who, crossed, twice, and, reported, in, detail, the, region, of, present, day, zimbabwe, including, the, shona, kingdoms, and, also, fortified, centers, in, stone, without, mortar, however, passing, en, route, a, few, kilometres, north, and, about, 56, km, 35, mi, south, of, the, site, he, did, not, make, a, reference, to, great, zimbabwe, portuguese, traders, heard, about, the, remains, of, the, medieval, city, in, the, early, 16th, century, and, records, survive, of, interviews, and, notes, made, by, some, of, them, linking, great, zimbabwe, to, gold, production, and, long, distance, trade, two, of, those, accounts, mention, an, inscription, above, the, entrance, to, great, zimbabwe, written, in, characters, not, known, to, the, arab, merchants, who, had, seen, it, in, 1506, the, explorer, diogo, de, alc, ova, described, the, edifices, in, a, letter, to, manuel, i, of, portugal, writing, that, they, were, part, of, the, larger, kingdom, of, ucalanga, presumably, karanga, a, dialect, of, the, shona, people, spoken, mainly, in, masvingo, and, midlands, provinces, of, zimbabwe, jo, o, de, barros, left, another, such, description, of, great, zimbabwe, in, 1538, as, recounted, to, him, by, moorish, traders, who, had, visited, the, area, and, possessed, knowledge, of, the, hinterland, he, indicates, that, the, edifices, were, locally, known, as, symbaoe, which, meant, royal, court, in, the, vernacular, as, to, the, actual, identity, of, the, builders, of, great, zimbabwe, de, barros, writes, when, and, by, whom, these, edifices, were, raised, as, the, people, of, the, land, are, ignorant, of, the, art, of, writing, there, is, no, record, but, they, say, they, are, the, work, of, the, devil, for, in, comparison, with, their, power, and, knowledge, it, does, not, seem, possible, to, them, that, they, should, be, the, work, of, man, additionally, with, regard, to, the, purpose, of, the, great, zimbabwe, ruins, de, barros, asserted, that, in, the, opinion, of, the, moors, who, saw, it, it, is, very, ancient, and, was, built, to, keep, possessions, of, the, mines, which, are, very, old, and, no, gold, has, been, extracted, from, them, for, years, because, of, the, wars, it, would, seem, that, some, prince, who, has, possession, of, these, mines, ordered, it, to, be, built, as, a, sign, thereof, which, he, afterwards, lost, in, the, course, of, time, and, through, their, being, so, remote, from, his, kingdom, de, barros, further, remarked, that, symbaoe, is, guarded, by, a, nobleman, who, has, charge, of, it, after, the, manner, of, a, chief, alcaide, and, they, call, this, officer, symbacayo, and, there, are, always, some, of, benomotapa, s, wives, therein, of, whom, symbacayo, takes, care, thus, great, zimbabwe, appears, to, have, still, been, inhabited, as, recently, as, the, early, 16th, century, the, ruins, were, rediscovered, during, a, hunting, trip, in, 1867, by, adam, render, a, german, american, hunter, prospector, and, trader, in, southern, africa, who, in, 1871, showed, the, ruins, to, karl, mauch, a, german, explorer, and, geographer, of, africa, karl, mauch, recorded, the, ruins, 3, september, 1871, and, immediately, speculated, about, a, possible, biblical, association, with, king, solomon, and, the, queen, of, sheba, an, explanation, which, had, been, suggested, by, earlier, writers, such, as, the, portuguese, jo, o, dos, santos, mauch, went, so, far, as, to, favour, a, legend, that, the, structures, were, built, to, replicate, the, palace, of, the, queen, of, sheba, in, jerusalem, and, claimed, a, wooden, lintel, at, the, site, must, be, lebanese, cedar, brought, by, phoenicians, the, sheba, legend, as, promoted, by, mauch, became, so, pervasive, in, the, white, settler, community, as, to, cause, the, later, scholar, james, theodore, bent, to, say, the, names, of, king, solomon, and, the, queen, of, sheba, were, on, everybody, s, lips, and, have, become, so, distasteful, to, us, that, we, never, expect, to, hear, them, again, without, an, involuntary, shudder, carl, peters, collected, a, ceramic, ushabti, in, 1905, flinders, petrie, examined, it, and, identified, a, cartouche, on, its, chest, as, belonging, to, the, 18th, dynasty, egyptian, pharaoh, thutmose, iii, and, suggested, that, it, was, a, statuette, of, the, king, and, cited, it, as, proof, of, commercial, ties, between, rulers, in, the, area, and, the, ancient, egyptians, during, the, new, kingdom, c, 1550, 1077, bc, if, not, a, relic, of, an, old, egyptian, station, near, the, local, gold, mines, johann, heinrich, sch, fer, later, appraised, the, statuette, and, argued, that, it, belonged, to, a, well, known, group, of, forgeries, after, having, received, the, ushabti, felix, von, luschan, suggested, that, it, was, of, more, recent, origin, than, the, new, kingdom, he, asserted, that, the, figurine, instead, appeared, to, date, to, the, subsequent, ptolemaic, era, c, 323, 30, bc, when, alexandria, based, greek, merchants, would, export, egyptian, antiquities, and, pseudo, antiquities, to, southern, africa, j, theodore, bent, undertook, a, season, at, zimbabwe, with, cecil, rhodes, s, patronage, and, funding, from, the, royal, geographical, society, and, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, this, and, other, excavations, undertaken, for, rhodes, resulted, in, a, book, publication, that, introduced, the, ruins, to, english, readers, bent, had, no, formal, archaeological, training, but, had, travelled, very, widely, in, arabia, greece, and, asia, minor, he, was, aided, by, the, expert, cartographer, and, surveyor, robert, m, w, swan, 1858, 1904, who, also, visited, and, surveyed, a, host, of, related, stone, ruins, nearby, bent, stated, in, the, first, edition, of, his, book, the, ruined, cities, of, mashonaland, 1892, that, the, ruins, revealed, either, the, phoenicians, or, the, arabs, as, builders, and, he, favoured, the, possibility, of, great, antiquity, for, the, fortress, by, the, third, edition, of, his, book, 1902, he, was, more, specific, with, his, primary, theory, being, a, semitic, race, and, of, arabian, origin, of, strongly, commercial, traders, living, within, a, client, african, city, the, construction, of, great, zimbabwe, is, also, claimed, by, the, lemba, as, documented, by, william, bolts, in, 1777, to, the, austrian, habsburg, authorities, and, by, an, a, a, anderson, writing, about, his, travels, north, of, the, limpopo, river, in, the, 19th, century, lemba, speak, the, bantu, languages, spoken, by, their, geographic, neighbours, and, resemble, them, physically, but, they, have, some, religious, practices, and, beliefs, similar, to, those, in, judaism, and, islam, which, they, claim, were, transmitted, by, oral, tradition, the, first, scientific, archaeological, excavations, at, the, site, were, undertaken, by, david, randall, maciver, for, the, british, association, in, 1905, 1906, in, medieval, rhodesia, he, rejected, the, claims, made, by, adam, render, carl, peters, and, karl, mauch, and, instead, wrote, of, the, existence, in, the, site, of, objects, that, were, of, bantu, origin, randall, maciver, concluded, that, all, available, evidence, led, him, to, believe, that, the, zimbabwe, structures, were, constructed, by, the, ancestors, of, the, shona, people, more, importantly, he, suggested, a, wholly, medieval, date, for, the, walled, fortifications, and, temple, this, claim, was, not, immediately, accepted, partly, due, to, the, relatively, short, and, undermanned, period, of, excavation, he, was, able, to, undertake, in, mid, 1929, gertrude, caton, thompson, concluded, after, a, twelve, day, visit, of, a, three, person, team, and, the, digging, of, several, trenches, that, the, site, was, indeed, created, by, bantu, she, had, first, sunk, three, test, pits, into, what, had, been, refuse, heaps, on, the, upper, terraces, of, the, hill, complex, producing, a, mix, of, unremarkable, pottery, and, ironwork, she, then, moved, to, the, conical, tower, and, tried, to, dig, under, the, tower, arguing, that, the, ground, there, would, be, undisturbed, but, nothing, was, revealed, some, further, test, trenches, were, then, put, down, outside, the, lower, great, enclosure, and, in, the, valley, ruins, which, unearthed, domestic, ironwork, glass, beads, and, a, gold, bracelet, caton, thompson, immediately, announced, her, bantu, origin, theory, to, a, meeting, of, the, british, association, in, johannesburg, examination, of, all, the, existing, evidence, gathered, from, every, quarter, still, can, produce, not, one, single, item, that, is, not, in, accordance, with, the, claim, of, bantu, origin, and, medieval, date, caton, thompson, s, claim, was, not, immediately, favoured, although, it, had, strong, support, among, some, scientific, archaeologists, due, to, her, modern, methods, her, most, important, contribution, was, in, helping, to, confirm, the, theory, of, a, medieval, origin, for, the, masonry, work, of, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, by, 1931, she, had, modified, her, bantu, theory, somewhat, allowing, for, a, possible, arabian, influence, for, the, towers, through, the, imitation, of, buildings, or, art, seen, at, coastal, arabian, trading, cities, since, the, 1950s, there, has, been, consensus, among, archaeologists, as, to, the, african, origins, of, great, zimbabwe, artefacts, and, radiocarbon, dating, indicate, settlement, in, at, least, the, 5th, century, with, continuous, settlement, of, great, zimbabwe, between, the, 12th, and, 15th, centuries, and, the, bulk, of, the, finds, from, the, 15th, century, the, radiocarbon, evidence, is, a, suite, of, 28, measurements, for, which, all, but, the, first, four, from, the, early, days, of, the, use, of, that, method, and, now, viewed, as, inaccurate, support, the, 12th, to, 15th, centuries, chronology, in, the, 1970s, a, beam, that, produced, some, of, the, anomalous, dates, in, 1952, was, reanalysed, and, gave, a, 14th, century, date, dated, finds, such, as, chinese, persian, and, syrian, artefacts, also, support, the, 12th, and, 15th, century, dates, archaeologists, generally, agree, that, the, builders, probably, spoke, one, of, the, shona, languages, based, upon, evidence, of, pottery, oral, traditions, and, anthropology, and, recent, scholarship, supports, the, construction, of, great, zimbabwe, and, the, origin, of, its, culture, by, shona, and, venda, peoples, who, were, probably, descended, from, the, gokomere, culture, the, gokomere, culture, an, eastern, bantu, subgroup, existed, in, the, area, from, around, 200, ad, and, flourished, from, 500, ad, to, about, 800, ad, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, it, constitutes, an, early, phase, of, the, great, zimbabwe, culture, the, gokomere, culture, likely, gave, rise, to, both, the, modern, mashona, people, an, ethnic, cluster, comprising, distinct, sub, ethnic, groups, such, as, the, local, karanga, clan, and, the, rozwi, culture, which, originated, as, several, shona, states, gokomere, peoples, were, probably, also, related, to, certain, nearby, early, bantu, groups, like, the, mapungubwe, civilisation, of, neighbouring, north, eastern, south, africa, which, is, believed, to, have, been, an, early, venda, speaking, culture, and, to, the, nearby, sotho, more, recent, archaeological, work, has, been, carried, out, by, peter, garlake, who, has, produced, the, comprehensive, descriptions, of, the, site, david, beach, and, thomas, huffman, who, have, worked, on, the, chronology, and, development, of, great, zimbabwe, and, gilbert, pwiti, who, has, published, extensively, on, trade, links, today, the, most, recent, consensus, appears, to, attribute, the, construction, of, great, zimbabwe, to, the, shona, people, some, evidence, also, suggests, an, early, influence, from, the, probably, venda, speaking, peoples, of, the, mapungubwe, civilization, damage, to, the, ruins, has, taken, place, throughout, the, last, century, the, removal, of, gold, and, artefacts, in, amateurist, diggings, by, early, colonial, antiquarians, caused, widespread, damage, notably, diggings, by, richard, nicklin, hall, more, extensive, damage, was, caused, by, the, mining, of, some, of, the, ruins, for, gold, reconstruction, attempts, since, 1980, caused, further, damage, leading, to, alienation, of, the, local, communities, from, the, site, another, source, of, damage, to, the, ruins, has, been, due, to, the, site, being, open, to, visitors, with, many, cases, of, people, climbing, the, walls, walking, over, archaeological, deposits, and, the, over, use, of, certain, paths, all, have, had, major, impacts, on, the, structures, at, the, site, these, are, in, conjunction, with, damages, due, to, the, natural, weathering, that, occurs, over, time, due, to, vegetation, growth, the, foundations, settling, and, erosion, from, the, weather, martin, hall, writes, that, the, history, of, iron, age, research, south, of, the, zambezi, shows, the, prevalent, influence, of, colonial, ideologies, both, in, the, earliest, speculations, about, the, nature, of, the, african, past, and, in, the, adaptations, that, have, been, made, to, contemporary, archaeological, methodologies, preben, kaarsholm, writes, that, both, colonial, and, black, nationalist, groups, invoked, great, zimbabwe, s, past, to, support, their, vision, of, the, country, s, present, through, the, media, of, popular, history, and, of, fiction, examples, of, such, popular, history, include, alexander, wilmot, s, monomotapa, rhodesia, and, ken, mufuka, s, dzimbahwe, life, and, politics, in, the, golden, age, examples, from, fiction, include, wilbur, smith, s, the, sunbird, and, stanlake, samkange, s, year, of, the, uprising, when, white, colonialists, like, cecil, rhodes, first, saw, the, ruins,
