a, conspiracy, theory, is, an, explanation, for, an, event, or, situation, that, asserts, the, existence, of, a, conspiracy, by, powerful, and, sinister, groups, often, political, in, motivation, when, other, explanations, are, more, probable, the, term, generally, has, a, negative, connotation, implying, that, the, appeal, of, a, conspiracy, theory, is, based, in, prejudice, emotional, conviction, or, insufficient, evidence, a, conspiracy, theory, is, distinct, from, a, conspiracy, it, refers, to, a, hypothesized, conspiracy, with, specific, characteristics, including, but, not, limited, to, opposition, to, the, mainstream, consensus, among, those, who, are, qualified, to, evaluate, its, accuracy, such, as, scientists, or, historians, conspiracy, theories, tend, to, be, internally, consistent, and, correlate, with, each, other, they, are, generally, designed, to, resist, falsification, either, by, evidence, against, them, or, a, lack, of, evidence, for, them, they, are, reinforced, by, circular, reasoning, both, evidence, against, the, conspiracy, and, absence, of, evidence, for, it, are, misinterpreted, as, evidence, of, its, truth, stephan, lewandowsky, observes, this, interpretation, relies, on, the, notion, that, the, stronger, the, evidence, against, a, conspiracy, the, more, the, conspirators, must, want, people, to, believe, their, version, of, events, as, a, consequence, the, conspiracy, becomes, a, matter, of, faith, rather, than, something, that, can, be, proven, or, disproven, studies, have, linked, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, to, distrust, of, authority, and, political, cynicism, some, researchers, suggest, that, conspiracist, ideation, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, may, be, psychologically, harmful, or, pathological, such, belief, is, correlated, with, psychological, projection, paranoia, and, machiavellianism, psychologists, usually, attribute, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, to, a, number, of, psychopathological, conditions, such, as, paranoia, schizotypy, narcissism, and, insecure, attachment, or, to, a, form, of, cognitive, bias, called, illusory, pattern, perception, it, has, also, been, linked, with, the, so, called, dark, triad, personality, types, whose, common, feature, is, lack, of, empathy, however, a, 2020, review, article, found, that, most, cognitive, scientists, view, conspiracy, theorizing, as, typically, nonpathological, given, that, unfounded, belief, in, conspiracy, is, common, across, both, historical, and, contemporary, cultures, and, may, arise, from, innate, human, tendencies, towards, gossip, group, cohesion, and, religion, one, historical, review, of, conspiracy, theories, concluded, that, evidence, suggests, that, the, aversive, feelings, that, people, experience, when, in, crisis, fear, uncertainty, and, the, feeling, of, being, out, of, control, stimulate, a, motivation, to, make, sense, of, the, situation, increasing, the, likelihood, of, perceiving, conspiracies, in, social, situations, historically, conspiracy, theories, have, been, closely, linked, to, prejudice, propaganda, witch, hunts, wars, and, genocides, they, are, often, strongly, believed, by, the, perpetrators, of, terrorist, attacks, and, were, used, as, justification, by, timothy, mcveigh, and, anders, breivik, as, well, as, by, governments, such, as, nazi, germany, the, soviet, union, and, turkey, aids, denialism, by, the, government, of, south, africa, motivated, by, conspiracy, theories, caused, an, estimated, 330, 000, deaths, from, aids, qanon, and, denialism, about, the, 2020, united, states, presidential, election, results, led, to, the, january, 6, united, states, capitol, attack, and, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, about, genetically, modified, foods, led, the, government, of, zambia, to, reject, food, aid, during, a, famine, at, a, time, when, three, million, people, in, the, country, were, suffering, from, hunger, conspiracy, theories, are, a, significant, obstacle, to, improvements, in, public, health, encouraging, opposition, to, such, public, health, measures, as, vaccination, and, water, fluoridation, they, have, been, linked, to, outbreaks, of, vaccine, preventable, diseases, other, effects, of, conspiracy, theories, include, reduced, trust, in, scientific, evidence, radicalization, and, ideological, reinforcement, of, extremist, groups, and, negative, consequences, for, the, economy, conspiracy, theories, once, limited, to, fringe, audiences, have, become, commonplace, in, mass, media, the, internet, and, social, media, emerging, as, a, cultural, phenomenon, of, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, they, are, widespread, around, the, world, and, are, often, commonly, believed, some, even, held, by, the, majority, of, the, population, interventions, to, reduce, the, occurrence, of, conspiracy, beliefs, include, maintaining, an, open, society, encouraging, people, to, use, analytical, thinking, and, reducing, feelings, of, uncertainty, anxiety, or, powerlessness, the, oxford, english, dictionary, defines, conspiracy, theory, as, the, theory, that, an, event, or, phenomenon, occurs, as, a, result, of, a, conspiracy, between, interested, parties, spec, a, belief, that, some, covert, but, influential, agency, typically, political, in, motivation, and, oppressive, in, intent, is, responsible, for, an, unexplained, event, it, cites, a, 1909, article, in, the, american, historical, review, as, the, earliest, usage, example, although, it, also, appeared, in, print, for, several, decades, before, the, earliest, known, usage, was, by, the, american, author, charles, astor, bristed, in, a, letter, to, the, editor, published, in, the, new, york, times, on, january, 11, 1863, he, used, it, to, refer, to, claims, that, british, aristocrats, were, intentionally, weakening, the, united, states, during, the, american, civil, war, in, order, to, advance, their, financial, interests, england, has, had, quite, enough, to, do, in, europe, and, asia, without, going, out, of, her, way, to, meddle, with, america, it, was, a, physical, and, moral, impossibility, that, she, could, be, carrying, on, a, gigantic, conspiracy, against, us, but, our, masses, having, only, a, rough, general, knowledge, of, foreign, affairs, and, not, unnaturally, somewhat, exaggerating, the, space, which, we, occupy, in, the, world, s, eye, do, not, appreciate, the, complications, which, rendered, such, a, conspiracy, impossible, they, only, look, at, the, sudden, right, about, face, movement, of, the, english, press, and, public, which, is, most, readily, accounted, for, on, the, conspiracy, theory, the, term, is, also, used, as, a, way, to, discredit, dissenting, analyses, robert, blaskiewicz, comments, that, examples, of, the, term, were, used, as, early, as, the, nineteenth, century, and, states, that, its, usage, has, always, been, derogatory, according, to, a, study, by, andrew, mckenzie, mcharg, in, contrast, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, term, conspiracy, theory, simply, suggests, a, plausible, postulate, of, a, conspiracy, and, did, not, at, this, stage, carry, any, connotations, either, negative, or, positive, though, sometimes, a, postulate, so, labeled, was, criticized, the, author, and, activist, george, monbiot, argued, that, the, terms, conspiracy, theory, and, conspiracy, theorist, are, misleading, as, conspiracies, truly, exist, and, theories, are, rational, explanations, subject, to, disproof, instead, he, proposed, the, terms, conspiracy, fiction, and, conspiracy, fantasist, the, term, conspiracy, theory, is, itself, the, subject, of, a, conspiracy, theory, which, posits, that, the, term, was, popularized, by, the, cia, in, order, to, discredit, conspiratorial, believers, particularly, critics, of, the, warren, commission, by, making, them, a, target, of, ridicule, in, his, 2013, book, conspiracy, theory, in, america, the, political, scientist, lance, dehaven, smith, wrote, that, the, term, entered, everyday, language, in, the, united, states, after, 1964, the, year, in, which, the, warren, commission, published, its, findings, on, the, kennedy, assassination, with, the, new, york, times, running, five, stories, that, year, using, the, term, whether, the, cia, was, responsible, for, popularising, the, term, conspiracy, theory, was, analyzed, by, michael, butter, a, professor, of, american, literary, and, cultural, history, at, the, university, of, t, bingen, butter, wrote, in, 2020, that, the, cia, document, concerning, criticism, of, the, warren, report, which, proponents, of, the, theory, use, as, evidence, of, cia, motive, and, intention, does, not, contain, the, phrase, conspiracy, theory, in, the, singular, and, only, uses, the, term, conspiracy, theories, once, in, the, sentence, conspiracy, theories, have, frequently, thrown, suspicion, on, our, organisation, for, example, by, falsely, alleging, that, lee, harvey, oswald, worked, for, us, a, conspiracy, theory, is, not, simply, a, conspiracy, which, refers, to, any, covert, plan, involving, two, or, more, people, in, contrast, the, term, conspiracy, theory, refers, to, hypothesized, conspiracies, that, have, specific, characteristics, for, example, conspiracist, beliefs, invariably, oppose, the, mainstream, consensus, among, those, people, who, are, qualified, to, evaluate, their, accuracy, such, as, scientists, or, historians, conspiracy, theorists, see, themselves, as, having, privileged, access, to, socially, persecuted, knowledge, or, a, stigmatized, mode, of, thought, that, separates, them, from, the, masses, who, believe, the, official, account, michael, barkun, describes, a, conspiracy, theory, as, a, template, imposed, upon, the, world, to, give, the, appearance, of, order, to, events, real, conspiracies, even, very, simple, ones, are, difficult, to, conceal, and, routinely, experience, unexpected, problems, in, contrast, conspiracy, theories, suggest, that, conspiracies, are, unrealistically, successful, and, that, groups, of, conspirators, such, as, bureaucracies, can, act, with, near, perfect, competence, and, secrecy, the, causes, of, events, or, situations, are, simplified, to, exclude, complex, or, interacting, factors, as, well, as, the, role, of, chance, and, unintended, consequences, nearly, all, observations, are, explained, as, having, been, deliberately, planned, by, the, alleged, conspirators, in, conspiracy, theories, the, conspirators, are, usually, claimed, to, be, acting, with, extreme, malice, as, described, by, robert, brotherton, the, malevolent, intent, assumed, by, most, conspiracy, theories, goes, far, beyond, everyday, plots, borne, out, of, self, interest, corruption, cruelty, and, criminality, the, postulated, conspirators, are, not, merely, people, with, selfish, agendas, or, differing, values, rather, conspiracy, theories, postulate, a, black, and, white, world, in, which, good, is, struggling, against, evil, the, general, public, is, cast, as, the, victim, of, organised, persecution, and, the, motives, of, the, alleged, conspirators, often, verge, on, pure, maniacal, evil, at, the, very, least, the, conspirators, are, said, to, have, an, almost, inhuman, disregard, for, the, basic, liberty, and, well, being, of, the, general, population, more, grandiose, conspiracy, theories, portray, the, conspirators, as, being, evil, incarnate, of, having, caused, all, the, ills, from, which, we, suffer, committing, abominable, acts, of, unthinkable, cruelty, on, a, routine, basis, and, striving, ultimately, to, subvert, or, destroy, everything, we, hold, dear, a, conspiracy, theory, may, take, any, matter, as, its, subject, but, certain, subjects, attract, greater, interest, than, others, favored, subjects, include, famous, deaths, and, assassinations, morally, dubious, government, activities, suppressed, technologies, and, false, flag, terrorism, among, the, longest, standing, and, most, widely, recognized, conspiracy, theories, are, notions, concerning, the, assassination, of, john, f, kennedy, the, 1969, apollo, moon, landings, and, the, 9, 11, terrorist, attacks, as, well, as, numerous, theories, pertaining, to, alleged, plots, for, world, domination, by, various, groups, both, real, and, imaginary, conspiracy, beliefs, are, widespread, around, the, world, in, rural, africa, common, targets, of, conspiracy, theorizing, include, societal, elites, enemy, tribes, and, the, western, world, with, conspirators, often, alleged, to, enact, their, plans, via, sorcery, or, witchcraft, one, common, belief, identifies, modern, technology, as, itself, being, a, form, of, sorcery, created, with, the, goal, of, harming, or, controlling, the, people, in, china, one, widely, published, conspiracy, theory, claims, that, a, number, of, events, including, the, rise, of, hitler, the, 1997, asian, financial, crisis, and, climate, change, were, planned, by, the, rothschild, family, which, may, have, led, to, effects, on, discussions, about, china, s, currency, policy, conspiracy, theories, once, limited, to, fringe, audiences, have, become, commonplace, in, mass, media, contributing, to, conspiracism, emerging, as, a, cultural, phenomenon, in, the, united, states, of, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, the, general, predisposition, to, believe, conspiracy, theories, cuts, across, partisan, and, ideological, lines, conspiratorial, thinking, is, correlated, with, antigovernmental, orientations, and, a, low, sense, of, political, efficacy, with, conspiracy, believers, perceiving, a, governmental, threat, to, individual, rights, and, displaying, a, deep, skepticism, that, who, one, votes, for, really, matters, conspiracy, theories, are, often, commonly, believed, some, even, being, held, by, the, majority, of, the, population, a, broad, cross, section, of, americans, today, gives, credence, to, at, least, some, conspiracy, theories, for, instance, a, study, conducted, in, 2016, found, that, 10, of, americans, think, the, chemtrail, conspiracy, theory, is, completely, true, and, 20, 30, think, it, is, somewhat, true, this, puts, the, equivalent, of, 120, million, americans, in, the, chemtrails, are, real, camp, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, has, therefore, become, a, topic, of, interest, for, sociologists, psychologists, and, experts, in, folklore, conspiracy, theories, are, widely, present, on, the, web, in, the, form, of, blogs, and, youtube, videos, as, well, as, on, social, media, whether, the, web, has, increased, the, prevalence, of, conspiracy, theories, or, not, is, an, open, research, question, the, presence, and, representation, of, conspiracy, theories, in, search, engine, results, has, been, monitored, and, studied, showing, significant, variation, across, different, topics, and, a, general, absence, of, reputable, high, quality, links, in, the, results, one, conspiracy, theory, that, propagated, through, former, us, president, barack, obama, s, time, in, office, claimed, that, he, was, born, in, kenya, instead, of, hawaii, where, he, was, actually, born, former, governor, of, arkansas, and, political, opponent, of, obama, mike, huckabee, made, headlines, in, 2011, when, he, among, other, members, of, republican, leadership, continued, to, question, obama, s, citizenship, status, a, conspiracy, theory, can, be, local, or, international, focused, on, single, events, or, covering, multiple, incidents, and, entire, countries, regions, and, periods, of, history, according, to, russell, muirhead, and, nancy, rosenblum, historically, traditional, conspiracism, has, entailed, a, theory, but, over, time, conspiracy, and, theory, have, become, decoupled, as, modern, conspiracism, is, often, without, any, kind, of, theory, behind, it, jesse, walker, 2013, has, identified, five, kinds, of, conspiracy, theories, michael, barkun, has, identified, three, classifications, of, conspiracy, theory, murray, rothbard, argues, in, favor, of, a, model, that, contrasts, deep, conspiracy, theories, to, shallow, ones, according, to, rothbard, a, shallow, theorist, observes, an, event, and, asks, cui, bono, who, benefits, jumping, to, the, conclusion, that, a, posited, beneficiary, is, responsible, for, covertly, influencing, events, on, the, other, hand, the, deep, conspiracy, theorist, begins, with, a, hunch, and, then, seeks, out, evidence, rothbard, describes, this, latter, activity, as, a, matter, of, confirming, with, certain, facts, one, s, initial, paranoia, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, is, generally, based, not, on, evidence, but, in, the, faith, of, the, believer, noam, chomsky, contrasts, conspiracy, theory, to, institutional, analysis, which, focuses, mostly, on, the, public, long, term, behavior, of, publicly, known, institutions, as, recorded, in, for, example, scholarly, documents, or, mainstream, media, reports, conspiracy, theory, conversely, posits, the, existence, of, secretive, coalitions, of, individuals, and, speculates, on, their, alleged, activities, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, is, associated, with, biases, in, reasoning, such, as, the, conjunction, fallacy, clare, birchall, at, king, s, college, london, describes, conspiracy, theory, as, a, form, of, popular, knowledge, or, interpretation, the, use, of, the, word, knowledge, here, suggests, ways, in, which, conspiracy, theory, may, be, considered, in, relation, to, legitimate, modes, of, knowing, the, relationship, between, legitimate, and, illegitimate, knowledge, birchall, claims, is, closer, than, common, dismissals, of, conspiracy, theory, contend, theories, involving, multiple, conspirators, that, are, proven, to, be, correct, such, as, the, watergate, scandal, are, usually, referred, to, as, investigative, journalism, or, historical, analysis, rather, than, conspiracy, theory, bjerg, 2016, writes, the, way, we, normally, use, the, term, conspiracy, theory, excludes, instances, where, the, theory, has, been, generally, accepted, as, true, the, watergate, scandal, serves, as, the, standard, reference, by, contrast, the, term, watergate, conspiracy, theory, is, used, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, hypotheses, in, which, those, convicted, in, the, conspiracy, were, in, fact, the, victims, of, a, deeper, conspiracy, there, are, also, attempts, to, analyze, the, theory, of, conspiracy, theories, conspiracy, theory, theory, to, ensure, that, the, term, conspiracy, theory, is, used, to, refer, to, narratives, that, have, been, debunked, by, experts, rather, than, as, a, generalized, dismissal, conspiracy, theory, rhetoric, exploits, several, important, cognitive, biases, including, proportionality, bias, attribution, bias, and, confirmation, bias, their, arguments, often, take, the, form, of, asking, reasonable, questions, but, without, providing, an, answer, based, on, strong, evidence, conspiracy, theories, are, most, successful, when, proponents, can, gather, followers, from, the, general, public, such, as, in, politics, religion, and, journalism, these, proponents, may, not, necessarily, believe, the, conspiracy, theory, instead, they, may, just, use, it, in, an, attempt, to, gain, public, approval, conspiratorial, claims, can, act, as, a, successful, rhetorical, strategy, to, convince, a, portion, of, the, public, via, appeal, to, emotion, conspiracy, theories, typically, justify, themselves, by, focusing, on, gaps, or, ambiguities, in, knowledge, and, then, arguing, that, the, true, explanation, for, this, must, be, a, conspiracy, in, contrast, any, evidence, that, directly, supports, their, claims, is, generally, of, low, quality, for, example, conspiracy, theories, are, often, dependent, on, eyewitness, testimony, despite, its, unreliability, while, disregarding, objective, analyses, of, the, evidence, conspiracy, theories, are, not, able, to, be, falsified, and, are, reinforced, by, fallacious, arguments, in, particular, the, logical, fallacy, circular, reasoning, is, used, by, conspiracy, theorists, both, evidence, against, the, conspiracy, and, an, absence, of, evidence, for, it, are, re, interpreted, as, evidence, of, its, truth, whereby, the, conspiracy, becomes, a, matter, of, faith, rather, than, something, that, can, be, proved, or, disproved, the, epistemic, strategy, of, conspiracy, theories, has, been, called, cascade, logic, each, time, new, evidence, becomes, available, a, conspiracy, theory, is, able, to, dismiss, it, by, claiming, that, even, more, people, must, be, part, of, the, cover, up, any, information, that, contradicts, the, conspiracy, theory, is, suggested, to, be, disinformation, by, the, alleged, conspiracy, similarly, the, continued, lack, of, evidence, directly, supporting, conspiracist, claims, is, portrayed, as, confirming, the, existence, of, a, conspiracy, of, silence, the, fact, that, other, people, have, not, found, or, exposed, any, conspiracy, is, taken, as, evidence, that, those, people, are, part, of, the, plot, rather, than, considering, that, it, may, be, because, no, conspiracy, exists, this, strategy, lets, conspiracy, theories, insulate, themselves, from, neutral, analyses, of, the, evidence, and, makes, them, resistant, to, questioning, or, correction, which, is, called, epistemic, self, insulation, conspiracy, theorists, often, take, advantage, of, false, balance, in, the, media, they, may, claim, to, be, presenting, a, legitimate, alternative, viewpoint, that, deserves, equal, time, to, argue, its, case, for, example, this, strategy, has, been, used, by, the, teach, the, controversy, campaign, to, promote, intelligent, design, which, often, claims, that, there, is, a, conspiracy, of, scientists, suppressing, their, views, if, they, successfully, find, a, platform, to, present, their, views, in, a, debate, format, they, focus, on, using, rhetorical, ad, hominems, and, attacking, perceived, flaws, in, the, mainstream, account, while, avoiding, any, discussion, of, the, shortcomings, in, their, own, position, the, typical, approach, of, conspiracy, theories, is, to, challenge, any, action, or, statement, from, authorities, using, even, the, most, tenuous, justifications, responses, are, then, assessed, using, a, double, standard, where, failing, to, provide, an, immediate, response, to, the, satisfaction, of, the, conspiracy, theorist, will, be, claimed, to, prove, a, conspiracy, any, minor, errors, in, the, response, are, heavily, emphasized, while, deficiencies, in, the, arguments, of, other, proponents, are, generally, excused, in, science, conspiracists, may, suggest, that, a, scientific, theory, can, be, disproven, by, a, single, perceived, deficiency, even, though, such, events, are, extremely, rare, in, addition, both, disregarding, the, claims, and, attempting, to, address, them, will, be, interpreted, as, proof, of, a, conspiracy, other, conspiracist, arguments, may, not, be, scientific, for, example, in, response, to, the, ipcc, second, assessment, report, in, 1996, much, of, the, opposition, centered, on, promoting, a, procedural, objection, to, the, report, s, creation, specifically, it, was, claimed, that, part, of, the, procedure, reflected, a, conspiracy, to, silence, dissenters, which, served, as, motivation, for, opponents, of, the, report, and, successfully, redirected, a, significant, amount, of, the, public, discussion, away, from, the, science, historically, conspiracy, theories, have, been, closely, linked, to, prejudice, witch, hunts, wars, and, genocides, they, are, often, strongly, believed, by, the, perpetrators, of, terrorist, attacks, and, were, used, as, justification, by, timothy, mcveigh, anders, breivik, and, brenton, tarrant, as, well, as, by, governments, such, as, nazi, germany, and, the, soviet, union, aids, denialism, by, the, government, of, south, africa, motivated, by, conspiracy, theories, caused, an, estimated, 330, 000, deaths, from, aids, while, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, about, genetically, modified, foods, led, the, government, of, zambia, to, reject, food, aid, during, a, famine, at, a, time, when, 3, million, people, in, the, country, were, suffering, from, hunger, conspiracy, theories, are, a, significant, obstacle, to, improvements, in, public, health, people, who, believe, in, health, related, conspiracy, theories, are, less, likely, to, follow, medical, advice, and, more, likely, to, use, alternative, medicine, instead, conspiratorial, anti, vaccination, beliefs, such, as, conspiracy, theories, about, pharmaceutical, companies, can, result, in, reduced, vaccination, rates, and, have, been, linked, to, outbreaks, of, vaccine, preventable, diseases, health, related, conspiracy, theories, often, inspire, resistance, to, water, fluoridation, and, contributed, to, the, impact, of, the, lancet, mmr, autism, fraud, conspiracy, theories, are, a, fundamental, component, of, a, wide, range, of, radicalized, and, extremist, groups, where, they, may, play, an, important, role, in, reinforcing, the, ideology, and, psychology, of, their, members, as, well, as, further, radicalizing, their, beliefs, these, conspiracy, theories, often, share, common, themes, even, among, groups, that, would, otherwise, be, fundamentally, opposed, such, as, the, antisemitic, conspiracy, theories, found, among, political, extremists, on, both, the, far, right, and, far, left, more, generally, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, is, associated, with, holding, extreme, and, uncompromising, viewpoints, and, may, help, people, in, maintaining, those, viewpoints, while, conspiracy, theories, are, not, always, present, in, extremist, groups, and, do, not, always, lead, to, violence, when, they, are, they, can, make, the, group, more, extreme, provide, an, enemy, to, direct, hatred, towards, and, isolate, members, from, the, rest, of, society, conspiracy, theories, are, most, likely, to, inspire, violence, when, they, call, for, urgent, action, appeal, to, prejudices, or, demonize, and, scapegoat, enemies, conspiracy, theorizing, in, the, workplace, can, also, have, economic, consequences, for, example, it, leads, to, lower, job, satisfaction, and, lower, commitment, resulting, in, workers, being, more, likely, to, leave, their, jobs, comparisons, have, also, been, made, with, the, effects, of, workplace, rumors, which, share, some, characteristics, with, conspiracy, theories, and, result, in, both, decreased, productivity, and, increased, stress, subsequent, effects, on, managers, include, reduced, profits, reduced, trust, from, employees, and, damage, to, the, company, s, image, conspiracy, theories, can, divert, attention, from, important, social, political, and, scientific, issues, in, addition, they, have, been, used, to, discredit, scientific, evidence, to, the, general, public, or, in, a, legal, context, conspiratorial, strategies, also, share, characteristics, with, those, used, by, lawyers, who, are, attempting, to, discredit, expert, testimony, such, as, claiming, that, the, experts, have, ulterior, motives, in, testifying, or, attempting, to, find, someone, who, will, provide, statements, to, imply, that, expert, opinion, is, more, divided, than, it, actually, is, it, is, possible, that, conspiracy, theories, may, also, produce, some, compensatory, benefits, to, society, in, certain, situations, for, example, they, may, help, people, identify, governmental, deceptions, particularly, in, repressive, societies, and, encourage, government, transparency, however, real, conspiracies, are, normally, revealed, by, people, working, within, the, system, such, as, whistleblowers, and, journalists, and, most, of, the, effort, spent, by, conspiracy, theorists, is, inherently, misdirected, the, most, dangerous, conspiracy, theories, are, likely, to, be, those, that, incite, violence, scapegoat, disadvantaged, groups, or, spread, misinformation, about, important, societal, issues, strategies, to, address, conspiracy, theories, have, been, divided, into, two, categories, based, on, whether, the, target, audience, is, the, conspiracy, theorists, or, the, general, public, these, strategies, have, been, described, as, reducing, either, the, supply, or, the, demand, for, conspiracy, theories, both, approaches, can, be, used, at, the, same, time, although, there, may, be, issues, of, limited, resources, or, if, arguments, are, used, which, may, appeal, to, one, audience, at, the, expense, of, the, other, people, who, feel, empowered, are, more, resistant, to, conspiracy, theories, methods, to, promote, empowerment, include, encouraging, people, to, use, analytical, thinking, priming, people, to, think, of, situations, where, they, are, in, control, and, ensuring, that, decisions, by, society, and, government, are, seen, to, follow, procedural, fairness, the, use, of, fair, decision, making, procedures, methods, of, refutation, which, have, shown, effectiveness, in, various, circumstances, include, providing, facts, that, demonstrate, the, conspiracy, theory, is, false, attempting, to, discredit, the, source, explaining, how, the, logic, is, invalid, or, misleading, and, providing, links, to, fact, checking, websites, it, can, also, be, effective, to, use, these, strategies, in, advance, informing, people, that, they, could, encounter, misleading, information, in, the, future, and, why, the, information, should, be, rejected, also, called, inoculation, or, prebunking, while, it, has, been, suggested, that, discussing, conspiracy, theories, can, raise, their, profile, and, make, them, seem, more, legitimate, to, the, public, the, discussion, can, put, people, on, guard, instead, as, long, as, it, is, sufficiently, persuasive, other, approaches, to, reduce, the, appeal, of, conspiracy, theories, in, general, among, the, public, may, be, based, in, the, emotional, and, social, nature, of, conspiratorial, beliefs, for, example, interventions, that, promote, analytical, thinking, in, the, general, public, are, likely, to, be, effective, another, approach, is, to, intervene, in, ways, that, decrease, negative, emotions, and, specifically, to, improve, feelings, of, personal, hope, and, empowerment, it, is, much, more, difficult, to, convince, people, who, already, believe, in, conspiracy, theories, conspiracist, belief, systems, are, not, based, on, external, evidence, but, instead, use, circular, logic, where, every, belief, is, supported, by, other, conspiracist, beliefs, in, addition, conspiracy, theories, have, a, self, sealing, nature, in, which, the, types, of, arguments, used, to, support, them, make, them, resistant, to, questioning, from, others, characteristics, of, successful, strategies, for, reaching, conspiracy, theorists, have, been, divided, into, several, broad, categories, 1, arguments, can, be, presented, by, trusted, messengers, such, as, people, who, were, formerly, members, of, an, extremist, group, 2, since, conspiracy, theorists, think, of, themselves, as, people, who, value, critical, thinking, this, can, be, affirmed, and, then, redirected, to, encourage, being, more, critical, when, analyzing, the, conspiracy, theory, 3, approaches, demonstrate, empathy, and, are, based, on, building, understanding, together, which, is, supported, by, modeling, open, mindedness, in, order, to, encourage, the, conspiracy, theorists, to, do, likewise, 4, the, conspiracy, theories, are, not, attacked, with, ridicule, or, aggressive, deconstruction, and, interactions, are, not, treated, like, an, argument, to, be, won, this, approach, can, work, with, the, general, public, but, among, conspiracy, theorists, it, may, simply, be, rejected, interventions, that, reduce, feelings, of, uncertainty, anxiety, or, powerlessness, result, in, a, reduction, in, conspiracy, beliefs, other, possible, strategies, to, mitigate, the, effect, of, conspiracy, theories, include, education, media, literacy, and, increasing, governmental, openness, and, transparency, due, to, the, relationship, between, conspiracy, theories, and, political, extremism, the, academic, literature, on, deradicalization, is, also, important, one, approach, describes, conspiracy, theories, as, resulting, from, a, crippled, epistemology, in, which, a, person, encounters, or, accepts, very, few, relevant, sources, of, information, a, conspiracy, theory, is, more, likely, to, appear, justified, to, people, with, a, limited, informational, environment, who, only, encounter, misleading, information, these, people, may, be, epistemologically, isolated, in, self, enclosed, networks, from, the, perspective, of, people, within, these, networks, disconnected, from, the, information, available, to, the, rest, of, society, believing, in, conspiracy, theories, may, appear, to, be, justified, in, these, cases, the, solution, would, be, to, break, the, group, s, informational, isolation, public, exposure, to, conspiracy, theories, can, be, reduced, by, interventions, that, reduce, their, ability, to, spread, such, as, by, encouraging, people, to, reflect, before, sharing, a, news, story, researchers, carlos, diaz, ruiz, and, tomas, nilsson, have, proposed, technical, and, rhetorical, interventions, to, counter, the, spread, of, conspiracy, theories, on, social, media, the, primary, defense, against, conspiracy, theories, is, to, maintain, an, open, society, in, which, many, sources, of, reliable, information, are, available, and, government, sources, are, known, to, be, credible, rather, than, propaganda, additionally, independent, nongovernmental, organizations, are, able, to, correct, misinformation, without, requiring, people, to, trust, the, government, the, absence, of, civil, rights, and, civil, liberties, reduces, the, number, of, information, sources, available, to, the, population, which, may, lead, people, to, support, conspiracy, theories, since, the, credibility, of, conspiracy, theories, can, be, increased, if, governments, act, dishonestly, or, otherwise, engage, in, objectionable, actions, avoiding, such, actions, is, also, a, relevant, strategy, joseph, pierre, has, said, that, mistrust, in, authoritative, institutions, is, the, core, component, underlying, many, conspiracy, theories, and, that, this, mistrust, creates, an, epistemic, vacuum, and, makes, individuals, searching, for, answers, vulnerable, to, misinformation, therefore, one, possible, solution, is, offering, consumers, a, seat, at, the, table, to, mend, their, mistrust, in, institutions, regarding, the, challenges, of, this, approach, pierre, has, said, the, challenge, with, acknowledging, areas, of, uncertainty, within, a, public, sphere, is, that, doing, so, can, be, weaponized, to, reinforce, a, post, truth, view, of, the, world, in, which, everything, is, debatable, and, any, counter, position, is, just, as, valid, although, i, like, to, think, of, myself, as, a, middle, of, the, road, kind, of, individual, it, is, important, to, keep, in, mind, that, the, truth, does, not, always, lie, in, the, middle, of, a, debate, whether, we, are, talking, about, climate, change, vaccines, or, antipsychotic, medications, researchers, have, recommended, that, public, policies, should, take, into, account, the, possibility, of, conspiracy, theories, relating, to, any, policy, or, policy, area, and, prepare, to, combat, them, in, advance, conspiracy, theories, have, suddenly, arisen, in, the, context, of, policy, issues, as, disparate, as, land, use, laws, and, bicycle, sharing, programs, in, the, case, of, public, communications, by, government, officials, factors, that, improve, the, effectiveness, of, communication, include, using, clear, and, simple, messages, and, using, messengers, which, are, trusted, by, the, target, population, government, information, about, conspiracy, theories, is, more, likely, to, be, believed, if, the, messenger, is, perceived, as, being, part, of, someone, s, in, group, official, representatives, may, be, more, effective, if, they, share, characteristics, with, the, target, groups, such, as, ethnicity, in, addition, when, the, government, communicates, with, citizens, to, combat, conspiracy, theories, online, methods, are, more, efficient, compared, to, other, methods, such, as, print, publications, this, also, promotes, transparency, can, improve, a, message, s, perceived, trustworthiness, and, is, more, effective, at, reaching, underrepresented, demographics, however, as, of, 2019, many, governmental, websites, do, not, take, full, advantage, of, the, available, information, sharing, opportunities, similarly, social, media, accounts, need, to, be, used, effectively, in, order, to, achieve, meaningful, communication, with, the, public, such, as, by, responding, to, requests, that, citizens, send, to, those, accounts, other, steps, include, adapting, messages, to, the, communication, styles, used, on, the, social, media, platform, in, question, and, promoting, a, culture, of, openness, since, mixed, messaging, can, support, conspiracy, theories, it, is, also, important, to, avoid, conflicting, accounts, such, as, by, ensuring, the, accuracy, of, messages, on, the, social, media, accounts, of, individual, members, of, the, organization, successful, methods, for, dispelling, conspiracy, theories, have, been, studied, in, the, context, of, public, health, campaigns, a, key, characteristic, of, communication, strategies, to, address, medical, conspiracy, theories, is, the, use, of, techniques, that, rely, less, on, emotional, appeals, it, is, more, effective, to, use, methods, that, encourage, people, to, process, information, rationally, the, use, of, visual, aids, is, also, an, essential, part, of, these, strategies, since, conspiracy, theories, are, based, on, intuitive, thinking, and, visual, information, processing, relies, on, intuition, visual, aids, are, able, to, compete, directly, for, the, public, s, attention, in, public, health, campaigns, information, retention, by, the, public, is, highest, for, loss, framed, messages, that, include, more, extreme, outcomes, however, excessively, appealing, to, catastrophic, scenarios, e, g, low, vaccination, rates, causing, an, epidemic, may, provoke, anxiety, which, is, associated, with, conspiracism, and, could, increase, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, instead, scare, tactics, have, sometimes, had, mixed, results, but, are, generally, considered, ineffective, an, example, of, this, is, the, use, of, images, that, showcase, disturbing, health, outcomes, such, as, the, impact, of, smoking, on, dental, health, one, possible, explanation, is, that, information, processed, via, the, fear, response, is, typically, not, evaluated, rationally, which, may, prevent, the, message, from, being, linked, to, the, desired, behaviors, a, particularly, important, technique, is, the, use, of, focus, groups, to, understand, exactly, what, people, believe, and, the, reasons, they, give, for, those, beliefs, this, allows, messaging, to, focus, on, the, specific, concerns, that, people, identify, and, on, topics, that, are, easily, misinterpreted, by, the, public, since, these, are, factors, which, conspiracy, theories, can, take, advantage, of, in, addition, discussions, with, focus, groups, and, observations, of, the, group, dynamics, can, indicate, which, anti, conspiracist, ideas, are, most, likely, to, spread, interventions, that, address, medical, conspiracy, theories, by, reducing, powerlessness, include, emphasizing, the, principle, of, informed, consent, giving, patients, all, the, relevant, information, without, imposing, decisions, on, them, to, ensure, that, they, have, a, sense, of, control, improving, access, to, healthcare, also, reduces, medical, conspiracism, however, doing, so, by, political, efforts, can, also, fuel, additional, conspiracy, theories, which, occurred, with, the, affordable, care, act, obamacare, in, the, united, states, another, successful, strategy, is, to, require, people, to, watch, a, short, video, when, they, fulfil, requirements, such, as, registration, for, school, or, a, drivers, license, which, has, been, demonstrated, to, improve, vaccination, rates, and, signups, for, organ, donation, another, approach, is, based, on, viewing, conspiracy, theories, as, narratives, which, express, personal, and, cultural, values, making, them, less, susceptible, to, straightforward, factual, corrections, and, more, effectively, addressed, by, counter, narratives, counter, narratives, can, be, more, engaging, and, memorable, than, simple, corrections, and, can, be, adapted, to, the, specific, values, held, by, individuals, and, cultures, these, narratives, may, depict, personal, experiences, or, alternatively, they, can, be, cultural, narratives, in, the, context, of, vaccination, examples, of, cultural, narratives, include, stories, about, scientific, breakthroughs, about, the, world, before, vaccinations, or, about, heroic, and, altruistic, researchers, the, themes, to, be, addressed, would, be, those, that, could, be, exploited, by, conspiracy, theories, to, increase, vaccine, hesitancy, such, as, perceptions, of, vaccine, risk, lack, of, patient, empowerment, and, lack, of, trust, in, medical, authorities, it, has, been, suggested, that, directly, countering, misinformation, can, be, counterproductive, for, example, since, conspiracy, theories, can, reinterpret, disconfirming, information, as, part, of, their, narrative, refuting, a, claim, can, result, in, accidentally, reinforcing, it, which, is, referred, to, as, a, backfire, effect, in, addition, publishing, criticism, of, conspiracy, theories, can, result, in, legitimizing, them, in, this, context, possible, interventions, include, carefully, selecting, which, conspiracy, theories, to, refute, requesting, additional, analyses, from, independent, observers, and, introducing, cognitive, diversity, into, conspiratorial, communities, by, undermining, their, poor, epistemology, any, legitimization, effect, might, also, be, reduced, by, responding, to, more, conspiracy, theories, rather, than, fewer, there, are, psychological, mechanisms, by, which, backfire, effects, could, potentially, occur, but, the, evidence, on, this, topic, is, mixed, and, backfire, effects, are, very, rare, in, practice, a, 2020, review, of, the, scientific, literature, on, backfire, effects, found, that, there, have, been, widespread, failures, to, replicate, their, existence, even, under, conditions, that, would, be, theoretically, favorable, to, observing, them, due, to, the, lack, of, reproducibility, as, of, 2020, most, researchers, believe, that, backfire, effects, are, either, unlikely, to, occur, on, the, broader, population, level, or, they, only, occur, in, very, specific, circumstances, or, they, do, not, exist, brendan, nyhan, one, of, the, researchers, who, initially, proposed, the, occurrence, of, backfire, effects, wrote, in, 2021, that, the, persistence, of, misinformation, is, most, likely, due, to, other, factors, in, general, people, do, reject, conspiracy, theories, when, they, learn, about, their, contradictions, and, lack, of, evidence, for, most, people, corrections, and, fact, checking, are, very, unlikely, to, have, a, negative, impact, and, there, is, no, specific, group, of, people, in, which, backfire, effects, have, been, consistently, observed, presenting, people, with, factual, corrections, or, highlighting, the, logical, contradictions, in, conspiracy, theories, has, been, demonstrated, to, have, a, positive, effect, in, many, circumstances, for, example, this, has, been, studied, in, the, case, of, informing, believers, in, 9, 11, conspiracy, theories, about, statements, by, actual, experts, and, witnesses, one, possibility, is, that, criticism, is, most, likely, to, backfire, if, it, challenges, someone, s, worldview, or, identity, this, suggests, that, an, effective, approach, may, be, to, provide, criticism, while, avoiding, such, challenges, the, widespread, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, has, become, a, topic, of, interest, for, sociologists, psychologists, and, experts, in, folklore, since, at, least, the, 1960s, when, a, number, of, conspiracy, theories, arose, regarding, the, assassination, of, u, s, president, john, f, kennedy, sociologist, t, rkay, salim, nefes, underlines, the, political, nature, of, conspiracy, theories, he, suggests, that, one, of, the, most, important, characteristics, of, these, accounts, is, their, attempt, to, unveil, the, real, but, hidden, power, relations, in, social, groups, the, term, conspiracism, was, popularized, by, academic, frank, p, mintz, in, the, 1980s, according, to, mintz, conspiracism, denotes, belief, in, the, primacy, of, conspiracies, in, the, unfolding, of, history, 4, conspiracism, serves, the, needs, of, diverse, political, and, social, groups, in, america, and, elsewhere, it, identifies, elites, blames, them, for, economic, and, social, catastrophes, and, assumes, that, things, will, be, better, once, popular, action, can, remove, them, from, positions, of, power, as, such, conspiracy, theories, do, not, typify, a, particular, epoch, or, ideology, 199, research, suggests, on, a, psychological, level, conspiracist, ideation, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, can, be, harmful, or, pathological, and, is, highly, correlated, with, psychological, projection, as, well, as, with, paranoia, which, is, predicted, by, the, degree, of, a, person, s, machiavellianism, the, propensity, to, believe, in, conspiracy, theories, is, strongly, associated, with, the, mental, health, disorder, of, schizotypy, conspiracy, theories, once, limited, to, fringe, audiences, have, become, commonplace, in, mass, media, emerging, as, a, cultural, phenomenon, of, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, exposure, to, conspiracy, theories, in, news, media, and, popular, entertainment, increases, receptiveness, to, conspiratorial, ideas, and, has, also, increased, the, social, acceptability, of, fringe, beliefs, conspiracy, theories, often, make, use, of, complicated, and, detailed, arguments, including, ones, which, appear, to, be, analytical, or, scientific, however, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, is, primarily, driven, by, emotion, one, of, the, most, widely, confirmed, facts, about, conspiracy, theories, is, that, belief, in, a, single, conspiracy, theory, tends, be, correlated, with, belief, in, other, conspiracy, theories, this, even, applies, when, the, conspiracy, theories, directly, contradict, each, other, e, g, believing, that, osama, bin, laden, was, already, dead, before, his, compound, in, pakistan, was, attacked, makes, the, same, person, more, likely, to, believe, that, he, is, still, alive, one, conclusion, from, this, finding, is, that, the, content, of, a, conspiracist, belief, is, less, important, than, the, idea, of, a, coverup, by, the, authorities, analytical, thinking, aids, in, reducing, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, in, part, because, it, emphasizes, rational, and, critical, cognition, some, psychological, scientists, assert, that, explanations, related, to, conspiracy, theories, can, be, and, often, are, internally, consistent, with, strong, beliefs, that, had, previously, been, held, prior, to, the, event, that, sparked, the, conspiracy, people, who, believe, in, conspiracy, theories, tend, to, believe, in, other, unsubstantiated, claims, including, pseudoscience, and, paranormal, phenomena, psychological, motives, for, believing, in, conspiracy, theories, can, be, categorized, as, epistemic, existential, or, social, these, motives, are, particularly, acute, in, vulnerable, and, disadvantaged, populations, however, it, does, not, appear, that, the, beliefs, help, to, address, these, motives, in, fact, they, may, be, self, defeating, acting, to, make, the, situation, worse, instead, for, example, while, conspiratorial, beliefs, can, result, from, a, perceived, sense, of, powerlessness, exposure, to, conspiracy, theories, immediately, suppresses, personal, feelings, of, autonomy, and, control, furthermore, they, also, make, people, less, likely, to, take, actions, that, could, improve, their, circumstances, this, is, additionally, supported, by, the, fact, that, conspiracy, theories, have, a, number, of, disadvantageous, attributes, for, example, they, promote, a, negative, and, distrustful, view, of, other, people, and, groups, who, are, allegedly, acting, based, on, antisocial, and, cynical, motivations, this, is, expected, to, lead, to, increased, alienation, and, anomie, and, reduced, social, capital, similarly, they, depict, the, public, as, ignorant, and, powerless, against, the, alleged, conspirators, with, important, aspects, of, society, determined, by, malevolent, forces, a, viewpoint, which, is, likely, to, be, disempowering, each, person, may, endorse, conspiracy, theories, for, one, of, many, different, reasons, the, most, consistently, demonstrated, characteristics, of, people, who, find, conspiracy, theories, appealing, are, a, feeling, of, alienation, unhappiness, or, dissatisfaction, with, their, situation, an, unconventional, worldview, and, a, feeling, of, disempowerment, while, various, aspects, of, personality, affect, susceptibility, to, conspiracy, theories, none, of, the, big, five, personality, traits, are, associated, with, conspiracy, beliefs, the, political, scientist, michael, barkun, discussing, the, usage, of, conspiracy, theory, in, contemporary, american, culture, holds, that, this, term, is, used, for, a, belief, that, explains, an, event, as, the, result, of, a, secret, plot, by, exceptionally, powerful, and, cunning, conspirators, to, achieve, a, malevolent, end, according, to, barkun, the, appeal, of, conspiracism, is, threefold, this, third, point, is, supported, by, research, of, roland, imhoff, professor, of, social, psychology, at, the, johannes, gutenberg, university, mainz, the, research, suggests, that, the, smaller, the, minority, believing, in, a, specific, theory, the, more, attractive, it, is, to, conspiracy, theorists, humanistic, psychologists, argue, that, even, if, a, posited, cabal, behind, an, alleged, conspiracy, is, almost, always, perceived, as, hostile, there, often, remains, an, element, of, reassurance, for, theorists, this, is, because, it, is, a, consolation, to, imagine, that, difficulties, in, human, affairs, are, created, by, humans, and, remain, within, human, control, if, a, cabal, can, be, implicated, there, may, be, a, hope, of, breaking, its, power, or, of, joining, it, belief, in, the, power, of, a, cabal, is, an, implicit, assertion, of, human, dignity, an, unconscious, affirmation, that, man, is, responsible, for, his, own, destiny, people, formulate, conspiracy, theories, to, explain, for, example, power, relations, in, social, groups, and, the, perceived, existence, of, evil, forces, proposed, psychological, origins, of, conspiracy, theorising, include, projection, the, personal, need, to, explain, a, significant, event, a, significant, cause, and, the, product, of, various, kinds, and, stages, of, thought, disorder, such, as, paranoid, disposition, ranging, in, severity, to, diagnosable, mental, illnesses, some, people, prefer, socio, political, explanations, over, the, insecurity, of, encountering, random, unpredictable, or, otherwise, inexplicable, events, according, to, berlet, and, lyons, conspiracism, is, a, particular, narrative, form, of, scapegoating, that, frames, demonized, enemies, as, part, of, a, vast, insidious, plot, against, the, common, good, while, it, valorizes, the, scapegoater, as, a, hero, for, sounding, the, alarm, some, psychologists, believe, that, a, search, for, meaning, is, common, in, conspiracism, once, cognized, confirmation, bias, and, avoidance, of, cognitive, dissonance, may, reinforce, the, belief, in, a, context, where, a, conspiracy, theory, has, become, embedded, within, a, social, group, communal, reinforcement, may, also, play, a, part, inquiry, into, possible, motives, behind, the, accepting, of, irrational, conspiracy, theories, has, linked, these, beliefs, to, distress, resulting, from, an, event, that, occurred, such, as, the, events, of, 9, 11, additional, research, suggests, that, delusional, ideation, is, the, trait, most, likely, to, indicate, a, stronger, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, research, also, shows, an, increased, attachment, to, these, irrational, beliefs, leads, to, a, decreased, desire, for, civic, engagement, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, is, correlated, with, low, intelligence, lower, analytical, thinking, anxiety, disorders, paranoia, and, authoritarian, beliefs, professor, quassim, cassam, argues, that, conspiracy, theorists, hold, their, beliefs, due, to, flaws, in, their, thinking, and, more, precisely, their, intellectual, character, he, cites, philosopher, linda, trinkaus, zagzebski, and, her, book, virtues, of, the, mind, in, outlining, intellectual, virtues, such, as, humility, caution, and, carefulness, and, intellectual, vices, such, as, gullibility, carelessness, and, closed, mindedness, whereas, intellectual, virtues, help, in, reaching, sound, examination, intellectual, vices, impede, effective, and, responsible, inquiry, meaning, that, those, who, are, prone, to, believing, in, conspiracy, theories, possess, certain, vices, while, lacking, necessary, virtues, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, conspiracy, theories, could, be, partially, caused, by, psychological, mechanisms, the, human, brain, possesses, for, detecting, dangerous, coalitions, such, a, mechanism, could, have, been, useful, in, the, small, scale, environment, humanity, evolved, in, but, are, mismatched, in, a, modern, complex, society, and, thus, misfire, perceiving, conspiracies, where, none, exist, some, historians, have, argued, that, psychological, projection, is, prevalent, amongst, conspiracy, theorists, this, projection, according, to, the, argument, is, manifested, in, the, form, of, attribution, of, undesirable, characteristics, of, the, self, to, the, conspirators, historian, richard, hofstadter, stated, that, this, enemy, seems, on, many, counts, a, projection, of, the, self, both, the, ideal, and, the, unacceptable, aspects, of, the, self, are, attributed, to, him, a, fundamental, paradox, of, the, paranoid, style, is, the, imitation, of, the, enemy, the, enemy, for, example, may, be, the, cosmopolitan, intellectual, but, the, paranoid, will, outdo, him, in, the, apparatus, of, scholarship, even, of, pedantry, the, ku, klux, klan, imitated, catholicism, to, the, point, of, donning, priestly, vestments, developing, an, elaborate, ritual, and, an, equally, elaborate, hierarchy, the, john, birch, society, emulates, communist, cells, and, quasi, secret, operation, through, front, groups, and, preaches, a, ruthless, prosecution, of, the, ideological, war, along, lines, very, similar, to, those, it, finds, in, the, communist, enemy, spokesmen, of, the, various, fundamentalist, anti, communist, crusades, openly, express, their, admiration, for, the, dedication, discipline, and, strategic, ingenuity, the, communist, cause, calls, forth, hofstadter, also, noted, that, sexual, freedom, is, a, vice, frequently, attributed, to, the, conspiracist, s, target, group, noting, that, very, often, the, fantasies, of, true, believers, reveal, strong, sadomasochistic, outlets, vividly, expressed, for, example, in, the, delight, of, anti, masons, with, the, cruelty, of, masonic, punishments, marcel, danesi, suggests, that, people, who, believe, conspiracy, theories, have, difficulty, rethinking, situations, exposure, to, those, theories, has, caused, neural, pathways, which, are, more, rigid, and, less, subject, to, change, initial, susceptibility, to, believing, the, lies, dehumanizing, language, and, metaphors, of, these, theories, leads, to, the, acceptance, of, larger, and, more, extensive, theories, because, the, hardened, neural, pathways, are, already, present, repetition, of, the, facts, of, conspiracy, theories, and, their, connected, lies, simply, reinforces, the, rigidity, of, those, pathways, thus, conspiracy, theories, and, dehumanizing, lies, are, not, mere, hyperbole, they, can, actually, change, the, way, people, think, unfortunately, research, into, this, brain, wiring, also, shows, that, once, people, begin, to, believe, lies, they, are, unlikely, to, change, their, minds, even, when, confronted, with, evidence, that, contradicts, their, beliefs, it, is, a, form, of, brainwashing, once, the, brain, has, carved, out, a, well, worn, path, of, believing, deceit, it, is, even, harder, to, step, out, of, that, path, which, is, how, fanatics, are, born, instead, these, people, will, seek, out, information, that, confirms, their, beliefs, avoid, anything, that, is, in, conflict, with, them, or, even, turn, the, contrasting, information, on, its, head, so, as, to, make, it, fit, their, beliefs, people, with, strong, convictions, will, have, a, hard, time, changing, their, minds, given, how, embedded, a, lie, becomes, in, the, mind, in, fact, there, are, scientists, and, scholars, still, studying, the, best, tools, and, tricks, to, combat, lies, with, some, combination, of, brain, training, and, linguistic, awareness, in, addition, to, psychological, factors, such, as, conspiracist, ideation, sociological, factors, also, help, account, for, who, believes, in, which, conspiracy, theories, such, theories, tend, to, get, more, traction, among, election, losers, in, society, for, example, and, the, emphasis, of, conspiracy, theories, by, elites, and, leaders, tends, to, increase, belief, among, followers, who, have, higher, levels, of, conspiracy, thinking, christopher, hitchens, described, conspiracy, theories, as, the, exhaust, fumes, of, democracy, the, unavoidable, result, of, a, large, amount, of, information, circulating, among, a, large, number, of, people, conspiracy, theories, may, be, emotionally, satisfying, by, assigning, blame, to, a, group, to, which, the, theorist, does, not, belong, and, so, absolving, the, theorist, of, moral, or, political, responsibility, in, society, likewise, roger, cohen, writing, for, the, new, york, times, has, said, that, captive, minds, resort, to, conspiracy, theory, because, it, is, the, ultimate, refuge, of, the, powerless, if, you, cannot, change, your, own, life, it, must, be, that, some, greater, force, controls, the, world, sociological, historian, holger, herwig, found, in, studying, german, explanations, for, the, origins, of, world, war, i, those, events, that, are, most, important, are, hardest, to, understand, because, they, attract, the, greatest, attention, from, myth, makers, and, charlatans, justin, fox, of, time, magazine, argues, that, wall, street, traders, are, among, the, most, conspiracy, minded, group, of, people, and, ascribes, this, to, the, reality, of, some, financial, market, conspiracies, and, to, the, ability, of, conspiracy, theories, to, provide, necessary, orientation, in, the, market, s, day, to, day, movements, bruno, latour, notes, that, the, language, and, intellectual, tactics, of, critical, theory, have, been, appropriated, by, those, he, describes, as, conspiracy, theorists, including, climate, change, denialists, and, the, 9, 11, truth, movement, maybe, i, am, taking, conspiracy, theories, too, seriously, but, i, am, worried, to, detect, in, those, mad, mixtures, of, knee, jerk, disbelief, punctilious, demands, for, proofs, and, free, use, of, powerful, explanation, from, the, social, neverland, many, of, the, weapons, of, social, critique, michael, kelly, a, washington, post, journalist, and, critic, of, anti, war, movements, on, both, the, left, and, right, coined, the, term, fusion, paranoia, to, refer, to, a, political, convergence, of, left, wing, and, right, wing, activists, around, anti, war, issues, and, civil, liberties, which, he, said, were, motivated, by, a, shared, belief, in, conspiracism, or, shared, anti, government, views, barkun, has, adopted, this, term, to, refer, to, how, the, synthesis, of, paranoid, conspiracy, theories, which, were, once, limited, to, american, fringe, audiences, has, given, them, mass, appeal, and, enabled, them, to, become, commonplace, in, mass, media, thereby, inaugurating, an, unrivaled, period, of, people, actively, preparing, for, apocalyptic, or, millenarian, scenarios, in, the, united, states, of, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, barkun, notes, the, occurrence, of, lone, wolf, conflicts, with, law, enforcement, acting, as, proxy, for, threatening, the, established, political, powers, as, evidence, that, undermines, an, alleged, conspiracy, grows, the, number, of, alleged, conspirators, also, grows, in, the, minds, of, conspiracy, theorists, this, is, because, of, an, assumption, that, the, alleged, conspirators, often, have, competing, interests, for, example, if, republican, president, george, w, bush, is, allegedly, responsible, for, the, 9, 11, terrorist, attacks, and, the, democratic, party, did, not, pursue, exposing, this, alleged, plot, that, must, mean, that, both, the, democratic, and, republican, parties, are, conspirators, in, the, alleged, plot, it, also, assumes, that, the, alleged, conspirators, are, so, competent, that, they, can, fool, the, entire, world, but, so, incompetent, that, even, the, unskilled, conspiracy, theorists, can, find, mistakes, they, make, that, prove, the, fraud, at, some, point, the, number, of, alleged, conspirators, combined, with, the, contradictions, within, the, alleged, conspirators, interests, and, competence, becomes, so, great, that, maintaining, the, theory, becomes, an, obvious, exercise, in, absurdity, the, physicist, david, robert, grimes, estimated, the, time, it, would, take, for, a, conspiracy, to, be, exposed, based, on, the, number, of, people, involved, his, calculations, used, data, from, the, prism, surveillance, program, the, tuskegee, syphilis, experiment, and, the, fbi, forensic, scandal, grimes, estimated, that, grimes, s, study, did, not, consider, exposure, by, sources, outside, of, the, alleged, conspiracy, it, only, considered, exposure, from, within, the, alleged, conspiracy, through, whistleblowers, or, through, incompetence, subsequent, comments, on, the, pubpeer, website, point, out, that, these, calculations, must, exclude, successful, conspiracies, since, by, definition, we, don, t, know, about, them, and, are, wrong, by, an, order, of, magnitude, about, bletchley, park, which, remained, a, secret, far, longer, than, grimes, calculations, predicted, the, term, truth, seeker, is, adopted, by, some, conspiracy, theorists, when, describing, themselves, on, social, media, conspiracy, theorists, are, often, referred, to, derogatorily, as, cookers, in, australia, the, term, cooker, is, also, loosely, associated, with, the, far, right, the, philosopher, karl, popper, described, the, central, problem, of, conspiracy, theories, as, a, form, of, fundamental, attribution, error, where, every, event, is, generally, perceived, as, being, intentional, and, planned, greatly, underestimating, the, effects, of, randomness, and, unintended, consequences, in, his, book, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, he, used, the, term, the, conspiracy, theory, of, society, to, denote, the, idea, that, social, phenomena, such, as, war, unemployment, poverty, shortages, the, result, of, direct, design, by, some, powerful, individuals, and, groups, popper, argued, that, totalitarianism, was, founded, on, conspiracy, theories, which, drew, on, imaginary, plots, which, were, driven, by, paranoid, scenarios, predicated, on, tribalism, chauvinism, or, racism, he, also, noted, that, conspirators, very, rarely, achieved, their, goal, historically, real, conspiracies, have, usually, had, little, effect, on, history, and, have, had, unforeseen, consequences, for, the, conspirators, in, contrast, to, conspiracy, theories, which, often, posit, grand, sinister, organizations, or, world, changing, events, the, evidence, for, which, has, been, erased, or, obscured, as, described, by, bruce, cumings, history, is, instead, moved, by, the, broad, forces, and, large, structures, of, human, collectivities, conspiracy, theories, are, a, prevalent, feature, of, arab, culture, and, politics, variants, include, conspiracies, involving, colonialism, zionism, superpowers, oil, and, the, war, on, terrorism, which, is, often, referred, to, in, arab, media, as, a, war, against, islam, for, example, the, protocols, of, the, elders, of, zion, an, infamous, hoax, document, purporting, to, be, a, jewish, plan, for, world, domination, is, commonly, read, and, promoted, in, the, muslim, world, roger, cohen, has, suggested, that, the, popularity, of, conspiracy, theories, in, the, arab, world, is, the, ultimate, refuge, of, the, powerless, al, mumin, said, has, noted, the, danger, of, such, theories, for, they, keep, us, not, only, from, the, truth, but, also, from, confronting, our, faults, and, problems, osama, bin, laden, and, ayman, al, zawahiri, used, conspiracy, theories, about, the, united, states, to, gain, support, for, al, qaeda, in, the, arab, world, and, as, rhetoric, to, distinguish, themselves, from, similar, groups, although, they, may, not, have, believed, the, conspiratorial, claims, themselves, conspiracy, theories, are, a, prevalent, feature, of, culture, and, politics, in, turkey, conspiracism, is, an, important, phenomenon, in, understanding, turkish, politics, this, is, explained, by, a, desire, to, make, up, for, our, lost, ottoman, grandeur, the, humiliation, of, perceiving, turkey, as, part, of, the, malfunctioning, half, of, the, world, and, a, low, level, of, media, literacy, among, the, turkish, population, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, conspiracy, theories, including, the, judeo, masonic, conspiracy, theory, the, international, jewish, conspiracy, theory, and, the, war, against, islam, conspiracy, theory, for, example, islamists, dissatisfied, with, the, modernist, and, secularist, reforms, that, took, place, throughout, the, history, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, turkish, republic, have, put, forward, many, conspiracy, theories, to, defame, the, treaty, of, lausanne, an, important, peace, treaty, for, the, country, and, the, republic, s, founder, kemal, atat, rk, another, example, is, the, s, vres, syndrome, a, reference, to, the, treaty, of, s, vres, of, 1920, a, popular, belief, in, turkey, that, dangerous, internal, and, external, enemies, especially, the, west, are, conspiring, to, weaken, and, carve, up, the, turkish, republic, the, historian, richard, hofstadter, addressed, the, role, of, paranoia, and, conspiracism, throughout, u, s, history, in, his, 1964, essay, the, paranoid, style, in, american, politics, bernard, bailyn, s, classic, the, ideological, origins, of, the, american, revolution, 1967, notes, that, a, similar, phenomenon, could, be, found, in, north, america, during, the, time, preceding, the, american, revolution, conspiracism, labels, people, s, attitudes, as, well, as, the, type, of, conspiracy, theories, that, are, more, global, and, historical, in, proportion, harry, g, west, and, others, have, noted, that, while, conspiracy, theorists, may, often, be, dismissed, as, a, fringe, minority, certain, evidence, suggests, that, a, wide, range, of, the, u, s, maintains, a, belief, in, conspiracy, theories, west, also, compares, those, theories, to, hypernationalism, and, religious, fundamentalism, theologian, robert, jewett, and, philosopher, john, shelton, lawrence, attribute, the, enduring, popularity, of, conspiracy, theories, in, the, u, s, to, the, cold, war, mccarthyism, and, counterculture, rejection, of, authority, they, state, that, among, both, the, left, wing, and, right, wing, there, remains, a, willingness, to, use, real, events, such, as, soviet, plots, inconsistencies, in, the, warren, report, and, the, 9, 11, attacks, to, support, the, existence, of, unverified, and, ongoing, large, scale, conspiracies, in, his, studies, of, american, political, demonology, historian, michael, paul, rogin, too, analyzed, this, paranoid, style, of, politics, that, has, occurred, throughout, american, history, conspiracy, theories, frequently, identify, an, imaginary, subversive, group, that, is, supposedly, attacking, the, nation, and, requires, the, government, and, allied, forces, to, engage, in, harsh, extra, legal, repression, of, those, threatening, subversives, rogin, cites, examples, from, the, red, scares, of, 1919, to, mccarthy, s, anti, communist, campaign, in, the, 1950s, and, more, recently, fears, of, immigrant, hordes, invading, the, us, unlike, hofstadter, rogin, saw, these, countersubversive, fears, as, frequently, coming, from, those, in, power, and, dominant, groups, instead, of, from, the, dispossessed, unlike, robert, jewett, rogin, blamed, not, the, counterculture, but, america, s, dominant, culture, of, liberal, individualism, and, the, fears, it, stimulated, to, explain, the, periodic, eruption, of, irrational, conspiracy, theories, the, watergate, scandal, has, also, been, used, to, bestow, legitimacy, to, other, conspiracy, theories, with, richard, nixon, himself, commenting, that, it, served, as, a, rorschach, ink, blot, which, invited, others, to, fill, in, the, underlying, pattern, historian, kathryn, s, olmsted, cites, three, reasons, why, americans, are, prone, to, believing, in, government, conspiracies, theories, alex, jones, referenced, numerous, conspiracy, theories, for, convincing, his, supporters, to, endorse, ron,
