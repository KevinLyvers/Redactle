palaeography, uk, or, paleography, us, ultimately, from, greek, palai, s, old, and, gr, phein, to, write, is, the, study, and, academic, discipline, of, the, analysis, of, historical, writing, systems, the, historicity, of, manuscripts, and, texts, subsuming, deciphering, and, dating, of, historical, manuscripts, including, the, analysis, of, historic, penmanship, handwriting, script, signification, and, printed, media, it, is, primarily, concerned, with, the, forms, processes, and, relationships, of, writing, and, printing, systems, as, evident, in, a, text, document, or, manuscript, and, analysis, of, the, substantive, textual, content, of, documents, is, a, secondary, function, included, in, the, discipline, is, the, practice, of, deciphering, reading, and, dating, manuscripts, and, the, cultural, context, of, writing, including, the, methods, with, which, writing, and, printing, of, texts, manuscripts, books, codices, and, tomes, tracts, and, monographs, etcetera, were, produced, and, the, history, of, scriptoria, this, discipline, is, important, for, understanding, authenticating, and, dating, historic, texts, however, in, the, absence, of, additional, evidence, it, cannot, be, used, to, pinpoint, exact, dates, the, discipline, is, one, of, the, auxiliary, sciences, of, history, and, is, considered, to, have, been, founded, by, jean, mabillon, with, his, work, de, re, diplomatica, published, in, 1681, which, was, the, first, textbook, to, address, the, subject, the, term, palaeography, was, coined, by, bernard, de, montfaucon, with, the, publication, of, his, work, on, greek, palaeography, the, palaeographia, graeca, in, 1708, palaeography, is, an, essential, skill, for, many, historians, semioticians, and, philologists, as, it, addresses, a, suite, of, interrelated, lines, of, inquiry, first, since, the, style, of, an, alphabet, grapheme, or, sign, system, set, within, a, register, in, each, given, dialect, and, language, has, evolved, constantly, it, is, necessary, to, know, how, to, decipher, its, individual, substantive, occurrence, make, up, and, constituency, for, example, assessing, its, characters, and, typology, as, they, existed, in, various, places, times, and, locations, in, addition, for, hand, written, texts, scribes, often, use, many, abbreviations, and, annotations, so, as, to, functionally, aid, speed, efficiency, and, ease, of, writing, and, in, some, registers, to, importantly, save, invaluable, space, of, the, medium, hence, the, specialist, palaeographer, philologist, and, semiotician, must, know, how, to, in, the, broadest, sense, interpret, comprehend, and, understand, them, knowledge, of, individual, letterforms, typographic, ligatures, signs, typology, fonts, graphemes, hieroglyphics, and, signification, forms, in, general, subsuming, punctuation, syntagm, and, proxemics, abbreviations, and, annotations, enables, the, palaeographer, to, read, comprehend, and, then, to, understand, the, text, and, or, the, relationship, and, hierarchy, between, texts, in, suite, the, palaeographer, philologist, and, semiotician, must, first, determine, language, then, dialect, and, then, the, register, function, and, purpose, of, the, text, that, is, one, must, by, necessity, become, expert, in, the, formation, historicity, and, evolution, of, these, languages, and, signification, communities, and, material, communication, events, secondly, the, historical, usages, of, various, styles, of, handwriting, common, writing, customs, and, scribal, or, notarial, abbreviations, annotations, conventions, annexures, addenda, and, specifics, of, printed, typology, syntagm, and, proxemics, must, be, assessed, as, a, collective, undertaking, philological, knowledge, of, the, register, language, vocabulary, and, grammar, generally, used, at, a, given, time, place, and, circumstance, may, assist, palaeographers, to, identify, a, hierarchy, of, texts, in, a, suite, through, discourse, analysis, determining, the, provenance, of, texts, identifying, forgeries, interpolations, and, recensions, with, precision, eliciting, a, professional, authenticity, in, documentation, textual, and, manuscript, evaluation, with, view, to, producing, a, critical, edition, if, required, and, a, critical, assessment, of, a, given, discourse, event, as, rendered, and, set, in, a, materiality, or, medium, knowledge, of, writing, materials, and, discourse, material, production, systems, is, foundational, to, the, study, of, handwriting, and, printing, events, and, to, the, identification, of, the, periods, in, which, a, document, or, manuscript, may, have, been, produced, an, important, goal, may, be, to, assign, the, text, a, date, and, a, place, of, origin, or, determining, which, translations, of, a, text, are, produced, from, which, specific, document, or, manuscript, this, is, why, the, palaeographer, and, attendant, semiologists, and, philologists, must, take, into, account, the, style, substance, and, formation, of, the, text, document, and, manuscript, and, the, handwriting, style, and, printed, typology, grapheme, typos, and, lexical, and, signification, system, s, employed, palaeography, may, be, employed, to, provide, information, about, the, date, at, which, a, document, was, written, however, paleography, is, a, last, resort, for, dating, and, for, book, hands, a, period, of, 50, years, is, the, least, acceptable, spread, of, time, with, it, being, suggested, that, the, rule, of, thumb, should, probably, be, to, avoid, dating, a, hand, more, precisely, than, a, range, of, at, least, seventy, or, eighty, years, in, a, 2005, e, mail, addendum, to, his, 1996, the, paleographical, dating, of, p, 46, paper, bruce, w, griffin, stated, until, more, rigorous, methodologies, are, developed, it, is, difficult, to, construct, a, 95, confidence, interval, for, manuscripts, without, allowing, a, century, for, an, assigned, date, william, schniedewind, went, even, further, in, the, abstract, to, his, 2005, paper, problems, of, paleographic, dating, of, inscriptions, and, stated, the, so, called, science, of, paleography, often, relies, on, circular, reasoning, because, there, is, insufficient, data, to, draw, precise, conclusion, about, dating, scholars, also, tend, to, oversimplify, diachronic, development, assuming, models, of, simplicity, rather, than, complexity, the, aramaic, language, was, the, international, trade, language, of, the, ancient, middle, east, originating, in, what, is, modern, day, syria, between, 1000, and, 600, bc, it, spread, from, the, mediterranean, coast, to, the, borders, of, india, becoming, extremely, popular, and, being, adopted, by, many, people, both, with, or, without, any, previous, writing, system, the, aramaic, script, was, written, in, a, consonantal, form, with, a, direction, from, right, to, left, the, aramaic, alphabet, a, modified, form, of, phoenician, was, the, ancestor, of, the, modern, arabic, and, hebrew, scripts, as, well, as, the, brahmi, script, the, parent, writing, system, of, most, modern, abugidas, in, india, southeast, asia, tibet, and, mongolia, initially, the, aramaic, script, did, not, differ, from, the, phoenician, but, then, the, aramaeans, simplified, some, of, the, letters, thickened, and, rounded, their, lines, a, specific, feature, of, its, letters, is, the, distinction, between, d, and, r, one, innovation, in, aramaic, is, the, matres, lectionis, system, to, indicate, certain, vowels, early, phoenician, derived, scripts, did, not, have, letters, for, vowels, and, so, most, texts, recorded, just, consonants, most, likely, as, a, consequence, of, phonetic, changes, in, north, semitic, languages, the, aramaeans, reused, certain, letters, in, the, alphabet, to, represent, long, vowels, the, letter, aleph, was, employed, to, write, he, for, yod, for, and, vav, for, aramaic, writing, and, language, supplanted, babylonian, cuneiform, and, akkadian, language, even, in, their, homeland, in, mesopotamia, the, wide, diffusion, of, aramaic, letters, led, to, its, writing, being, used, not, only, in, monumental, inscriptions, but, also, on, papyrus, and, potsherds, aramaic, papyri, have, been, found, in, large, numbers, in, egypt, especially, at, elephantine, among, them, are, official, and, private, documents, of, the, jewish, military, settlement, in, 5, bc, in, the, aramaic, papyri, and, potsherds, words, are, separated, usually, by, a, small, gap, as, in, modern, writing, at, the, turn, of, the, 3rd, to, 2nd, centuries, bc, the, heretofore, uniform, aramaic, letters, developed, new, forms, as, a, result, of, dialectal, and, political, fragmentation, in, several, subgroups, the, most, important, of, these, is, the, so, called, square, hebrew, block, script, followed, by, palmyrene, nabataean, and, the, much, later, syriac, script, aramaic, is, usually, divided, into, three, main, parts, the, term, middle, aramaic, refers, to, the, form, of, aramaic, which, appears, in, pointed, texts, and, is, reached, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, with, the, loss, of, short, unstressed, vowels, in, open, syllables, and, continues, until, the, triumph, of, arabic, old, aramaic, appeared, in, the, 11th, century, bc, as, the, official, language, of, the, first, aramaean, states, the, oldest, witnesses, to, it, are, inscriptions, from, northern, syria, of, the, 10th, to, 8th, centuries, bc, especially, extensive, state, treaties, c, 750, bc, and, royal, inscriptions, the, early, old, ancient, should, be, classified, as, ancient, aramaic, and, consists, of, two, clearly, distinguished, and, standardised, written, languages, the, early, ancient, aramaic, and, the, late, ancient, aramaic, aramaic, was, influenced, at, first, principally, by, akkadian, then, from, the, 5th, century, bc, by, persian, and, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, onwards, by, greek, as, well, as, by, hebrew, especially, in, palestine, as, aramaic, evolved, into, the, imperial, language, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, the, script, used, to, write, it, underwent, a, change, into, something, more, cursive, the, best, examples, of, this, script, come, from, documents, written, on, papyrus, from, egypt, about, 500, bc, darius, i, 522, 486, made, the, aramaic, used, by, the, imperial, administration, into, the, official, language, of, the, western, half, of, the, achaemenid, empire, this, so, called, imperial, aramaic, the, oldest, dated, example, from, egypt, belonging, to, 495, bc, is, based, on, an, otherwise, unknown, written, form, of, ancient, aramaic, from, babylonia, in, orthography, imperial, aramaic, preserves, historical, forms, alphabet, orthography, morphology, pronunciation, vocabulary, syntax, and, style, are, highly, standardised, only, the, formularies, of, the, private, documents, and, the, proverbs, of, ahiqar, have, maintained, an, older, tradition, of, sentence, structure, and, style, imperial, aramaic, immediately, replaced, ancient, aramaic, as, a, written, language, and, with, slight, modifications, it, remained, the, official, commercial, and, literary, language, of, the, near, east, until, gradually, beginning, with, the, fall, of, the, achaemenids, in, 331, bc, and, ending, in, the, 4th, century, ad, it, was, replaced, by, greek, persian, the, eastern, and, western, dialects, of, aramaic, and, arabic, though, not, without, leaving, its, traces, in, the, written, form, of, most, of, these, in, its, original, achaemenid, form, imperial, aramaic, is, found, in, texts, of, the, 5th, to, 3rd, centuries, bc, these, come, mostly, from, egypt, and, especially, from, the, jewish, military, colony, of, elephantine, which, existed, at, least, from, 530, to, 399, bc, a, history, of, greek, handwriting, must, be, incomplete, owing, to, the, fragmentary, nature, of, evidence, if, one, rules, out, the, inscriptions, on, stone, or, metal, which, belong, to, the, science, of, epigraphy, there, is, practically, a, dependence, on, papyri, from, egypt, for, the, period, preceding, the, 4th, or, 5th, century, ad, the, earliest, of, which, take, back, our, knowledge, only, to, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, this, limitation, is, less, serious, than, might, appear, since, the, few, manuscripts, not, of, egyptian, origin, which, have, survived, from, this, period, like, the, parchments, from, avroman, or, dura, the, herculaneum, papyri, and, a, few, documents, found, in, egypt, but, written, elsewhere, reveal, a, uniformity, of, style, in, the, various, portions, of, the, greek, world, however, differences, can, be, discerned, with, it, being, probable, that, distinct, local, styles, could, be, traced, were, there, more, material, to, analyze, further, during, any, given, period, several, types, of, hand, may, exist, together, there, was, a, marked, difference, between, the, hand, used, for, literary, works, generally, called, uncials, but, in, the, papyrus, period, better, styled, book, hand, and, that, of, documents, cursive, and, within, each, of, these, classes, several, distinct, styles, were, employed, side, by, side, and, the, various, types, are, not, equally, well, represented, in, the, surviving, papyri, the, development, of, any, hand, is, largely, influenced, by, the, materials, used, to, this, general, rule, the, greek, script, is, no, exception, whatever, may, have, been, the, period, at, which, the, use, of, papyrus, or, leather, as, a, writing, material, began, in, greece, and, papyrus, was, employed, in, the, 5th, century, bc, it, is, highly, probable, that, for, some, time, after, the, introduction, of, the, alphabet, the, characters, were, incised, with, a, sharp, tool, on, stones, or, metal, far, oftener, than, they, were, written, with, a, pen, in, cutting, a, hard, surface, it, is, easier, to, form, angles, than, curves, in, writing, the, reverse, is, the, case, hence, the, development, of, writing, was, from, angular, letters, capitals, inherited, from, epigraphic, style, to, rounded, ones, uncials, but, only, certain, letters, were, affected, by, this, development, in, particular, e, uncial, c, and, to, a, lesser, extent, a, the, earliest, greek, papyrus, yet, discovered, is, probably, that, containing, the, persae, of, timotheus, which, dates, from, the, second, half, of, the, 4th, century, bc, and, its, script, has, a, curiously, archaic, appearance, e, and, have, the, capital, form, and, apart, from, these, test, letters, the, general, effect, is, one, of, stiffness, and, angularity, more, striking, is, the, hand, of, the, earliest, dated, papyrus, a, contract, of, 311, bc, written, with, more, ease, and, elegance, it, shows, little, trace, of, any, development, towards, a, truly, cursive, style, the, letters, are, not, linked, and, though, the, uncial, c, is, used, throughout, e, and, have, the, capital, forms, a, similar, impression, is, made, by, the, few, other, papyri, chiefly, literary, dating, from, about, 300, bc, e, may, be, slightly, rounded, approach, the, uncial, form, and, the, angular, occurs, as, a, letter, only, in, the, timotheus, papyrus, though, it, survived, longer, as, a, numeral, 200, but, the, hands, hardly, suggest, that, for, at, least, a, century, and, a, half, the, art, of, writing, on, papyrus, had, been, well, established, yet, before, the, middle, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, one, finds, both, a, practised, book, hand, and, a, developed, and, often, remarkably, handsome, cursive, these, facts, may, be, due, to, accident, the, few, early, papyri, happening, to, represent, an, archaic, style, which, had, survived, along, with, a, more, advanced, one, but, it, is, likely, that, there, was, a, rapid, development, at, this, period, due, partly, to, the, opening, of, egypt, with, its, supplies, of, papyri, and, still, more, to, the, establishment, of, the, great, alexandrian, library, which, systematically, copied, literary, and, scientific, works, and, to, the, multifarious, activities, of, hellenistic, bureaucracy, from, here, onward, the, two, types, of, script, were, sufficiently, distinct, though, each, influenced, the, other, to, require, separate, treatment, some, literary, papyri, like, the, roll, containing, aristotle, s, constitution, of, athens, were, written, in, cursive, hands, and, conversely, the, book, hand, was, occasionally, used, for, documents, since, the, scribe, did, not, date, literary, rolls, such, papyri, are, useful, in, tracing, the, development, of, the, book, hand, the, documents, of, the, mid, 3rd, century, bc, show, a, great, variety, of, cursive, hands, there, are, none, from, chancelleries, of, the, hellenistic, monarchs, but, some, letters, notably, those, of, apollonius, the, finance, minister, of, ptolemy, ii, to, this, agent, zeno, and, those, of, the, palestinian, sheikh, toubias, are, in, a, type, of, script, which, cannot, be, very, unlike, the, chancery, hand, of, the, time, and, show, the, ptolemaic, cursive, at, its, best, these, hands, have, a, noble, spaciousness, and, strength, and, though, the, individual, letters, are, by, no, means, uniform, in, size, there, is, a, real, unity, of, style, the, general, impression, being, one, of, breadth, and, uprightness, h, with, the, cross, stroke, high, with, the, middle, stroke, reduced, to, a, very, shallow, curve, sometimes, approaching, a, horizontal, line, and, with, its, cross, bar, extending, much, further, to, the, left, than, to, the, right, of, the, up, stroke, and, whose, last, stroke, is, prolonged, upwards, above, the, line, often, curving, backwards, are, all, broad, c, and, which, sometimes, takes, the, form, of, two, almost, perpendicular, strokes, joined, only, at, the, top, are, usually, small, is, rather, flat, its, second, loop, reduced, to, a, practically, straight, line, partly, by, the, broad, flat, tops, of, the, larger, letters, partly, by, the, insertion, of, a, stroke, connecting, those, like, h, which, are, not, naturally, adapted, to, linking, the, scribes, produced, the, effect, of, a, horizontal, line, along, the, top, of, the, writing, from, which, the, letters, seem, to, hang, this, feature, is, indeed, a, general, characteristic, of, the, more, formal, ptolemaic, script, but, it, is, specially, marked, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, besides, these, hand, of, chancery, type, there, are, numerous, less, elaborate, examples, of, cursive, varying, according, to, the, writer, s, skill, and, degree, of, education, and, many, of, them, strikingly, easy, and, handsome, in, some, cursiveness, is, carried, very, far, the, linking, of, letters, reaching, the, point, of, illegibility, and, the, characters, sloping, to, the, right, a, is, reduced, to, a, mere, acute, angle, t, has, the, cross, stroke, only, on, the, left, becomes, an, almost, straight, line, h, acquires, a, shape, somewhat, like, h, and, the, last, stroke, of, n, is, extended, far, upwards, and, at, times, flattened, out, until, it, is, little, more, than, a, diagonal, stroke, to, the, right, the, attempt, to, secure, a, horizontal, line, along, the, top, is, here, abandoned, this, style, was, not, due, to, inexpertness, but, to, the, desire, for, speed, being, used, especially, in, accounts, and, drafts, and, was, generally, the, work, of, practised, writers, how, well, established, the, cursive, hand, had, now, become, is, shown, in, some, wax, tablets, of, this, period, the, writing, on, which, despite, the, difference, of, material, closely, resemble, the, hands, of, papyri, documents, of, the, late, 3rd, and, early, 2nd, centuries, bc, show, there, is, nothing, analogous, to, the, apollonius, letters, perhaps, partly, by, the, accident, of, survival, in, the, more, formal, types, the, letters, stand, rather, stiffly, upright, often, without, the, linking, strokes, and, are, more, uniform, in, size, in, the, more, cursive, they, are, apt, to, be, packed, closely, together, these, features, are, more, marked, in, the, hands, of, the, 2nd, century, the, less, cursive, often, show, am, approximation, to, the, book, hand, the, letters, growing, rounder, and, less, angular, than, in, the, 3rd, century, in, the, more, cursive, linking, was, carried, further, both, by, the, insertion, of, coupling, strokes, and, by, the, writing, of, several, letters, continuously, without, raising, the, pen, so, that, before, the, end, of, the, century, an, almost, current, hand, was, evolved, a, characteristic, letter, which, survived, into, the, early, roman, period, is, t, with, its, cross, stroke, made, in, two, portions, variants, in, the, 1st, century, the, hand, tended, so, far, as, can, be, inferred, from, surviving, examples, to, disintegrate, one, can, recognise, the, signs, which, portend, a, change, of, style, irregularity, want, of, direction, and, the, loss, of, the, feeling, for, style, a, fortunate, accident, has, preserved, two, greek, parchments, written, in, parthia, one, dated, 88, bc, in, a, practically, unligatured, hand, the, other, 22, 21, bc, in, a, very, cursive, script, of, ptolemaic, type, and, though, each, has, non, egyptian, features, the, general, character, indicates, a, uniformity, of, style, in, the, hellenistic, world, the, development, of, the, ptolemaic, book, hand, is, difficult, to, trace, as, there, are, few, examples, mostly, not, datable, on, external, grounds, only, for, the, 3rd, century, bc, have, we, a, secure, basis, the, hands, of, that, period, have, an, angular, appearance, there, is, little, uniformity, in, the, size, of, individual, letters, and, though, sometimes, notably, in, the, petrie, papyrus, containing, the, phaedo, of, plato, a, style, of, considerable, delicacy, is, attained, the, book, hand, in, general, shows, less, mastery, than, the, contemporary, cursive, in, the, 2nd, century, the, letters, grew, rounder, and, more, uniform, in, size, but, in, the, 1st, century, there, is, a, certain, disintegration, perceptible, as, in, the, cursive, hand, probably, at, no, time, did, the, ptolemaic, book, hand, acquire, such, unity, of, stylistic, effect, as, the, cursive, papyri, of, the, roman, period, are, far, more, numerous, and, show, greater, variety, the, cursive, of, the, 1st, century, has, a, rather, broken, appearance, part, of, one, character, being, often, made, separately, from, the, rest, and, linked, to, the, next, letter, a, form, characteristic, of, the, 1st, and, 2nd, century, and, surviving, after, that, only, as, a, fraction, sign, 1, 8, is, in, the, shape, by, the, end, of, the, 1st, century, there, had, been, developed, several, excellent, types, of, cursive, which, though, differing, considerably, both, in, the, forms, of, individual, letters, and, in, general, appearance, bear, a, family, likeness, to, one, another, qualities, which, are, specially, noticeable, are, roundness, in, the, shape, of, letters, continuity, of, formation, the, pen, being, carried, on, from, character, to, character, and, regularity, the, letters, not, differing, strikingly, in, size, and, projecting, strokes, above, or, below, the, line, being, avoided, sometimes, especially, in, tax, receipts, and, in, stereotyped, formulae, cursiveness, is, carried, to, an, extreme, in, a, letter, of, the, prefect, dated, in, 209, we, have, a, fine, example, of, the, chancery, hand, with, tall, and, laterally, compressed, letters, very, narrow, and, and, often, written, high, in, the, line, this, style, from, at, least, the, latter, part, of, the, 2nd, century, exercised, considerable, influence, on, the, local, hands, many, of, which, show, the, same, characteristics, less, pronounced, and, its, effects, may, be, traced, into, the, early, part, of, the, 4th, century, hands, of, the, 3rd, century, uninfluenced, by, it, show, a, falling, off, from, the, perfection, of, the, 2nd, century, stylistic, uncertainty, and, a, growing, coarseness, of, execution, mark, a, period, of, decline, and, transition, several, different, types, of, book, hand, were, used, in, the, roman, period, particularly, handsome, is, a, round, upright, hand, seen, for, example, in, a, british, museum, papyrus, containing, odyssey, iii, the, cross, stroke, of, is, high, deeply, curved, and, has, the, form, uniformity, of, size, is, well, attained, and, a, few, strokes, project, and, these, but, slightly, above, or, below, the, line, another, type, well, called, by, palaeographer, schubart, the, severe, style, has, a, more, angular, appearance, and, not, infrequently, slopes, to, the, right, though, handsome, it, has, not, the, sumptuous, appearance, of, the, former, there, are, various, classes, of, a, less, pretentious, style, in, which, convenience, rather, than, beauty, was, the, first, consideration, and, no, pains, were, taken, to, avoid, irregularities, in, the, shape, and, alignment, of, the, letters, lastly, may, be, mentioned, a, hand, which, is, of, great, interest, as, being, the, ancestor, of, the, type, called, from, its, later, occurrence, in, vellum, codices, of, the, bible, the, biblical, hand, this, which, can, be, traced, back, at, least, the, late, 2nd, century, has, a, square, rather, heavy, appearance, the, letters, of, uniform, size, stand, upright, and, thick, and, thin, strokes, are, well, distinguished, in, the, 3rd, century, the, book, hand, like, the, cursive, appears, to, have, deteriorated, in, regularity, and, stylistic, accomplishment, in, the, charred, rolls, found, at, herculaneum, are, specimens, of, greek, literary, hands, from, outside, egypt, dating, to, c, 1, ad, a, comparison, with, the, egyptian, papyri, reveals, great, similarity, in, style, and, shows, that, conclusions, drawn, from, the, henads, of, egypt, may, with, caution, be, applied, to, the, development, of, writing, in, the, greek, world, generally, the, cursive, hand, of, the, 4th, century, shows, some, uncertainty, of, character, side, by, side, with, the, style, founded, on, the, chancery, hand, regular, in, formation, and, with, tall, and, narrow, letters, which, characterised, the, period, of, diocletian, and, lasted, well, into, the, century, we, find, many, other, types, mostly, marked, by, a, certain, looseness, and, irregularity, a, general, progress, towards, a, florid, and, sprawling, hand, is, easily, recognisable, but, a, consistent, and, deliberate, style, was, hardly, evolved, before, the, 5th, century, from, which, unfortunately, few, dated, documents, have, survived, byzantine, cursive, tends, to, an, exuberant, hand, in, which, the, long, strokes, are, excessively, extended, and, individual, letters, often, much, enlarged, but, not, a, few, hands, of, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, are, truly, handsome, and, show, considerable, technical, accomplishment, both, an, upright, and, a, sloping, type, occur, and, there, are, many, less, ornamental, hands, but, there, gradually, emerged, towards, the, 7th, century, two, general, types, one, especially, used, in, letters, and, contracts, a, current, hand, sloping, to, the, right, with, long, strokes, in, such, characters, at, which, has, the, h, shape, and, and, with, much, linking, of, letters, and, another, frequent, in, accounts, which, shows, at, least, in, essence, most, of, the, forms, of, the, later, minuscule, cf, below, this, is, often, upright, though, a, slope, to, the, right, is, quite, common, and, sometimes, especially, in, one, or, two, documents, of, the, early, arabic, period, it, has, an, almost, calligraphic, effect, in, the, byzantine, period, the, book, hand, which, in, earlier, times, had, more, than, once, approximated, to, the, contemporary, cursive, diverged, widely, from, it, the, change, from, papyrus, to, vellum, involved, no, such, modification, in, the, forms, of, letters, as, followed, that, from, metal, to, papyrus, the, justification, for, considering, the, two, materials, separately, is, that, after, the, general, adoption, of, vellum, the, egyptian, evidence, is, first, supplemented, and, later, superseded, by, that, of, manuscripts, from, elsewhere, and, that, during, this, period, the, hand, most, used, was, one, not, previously, employed, for, literary, purposes, the, prevailing, type, of, book, hand, during, what, in, papyrology, is, called, the, byzantine, period, that, is, roughly, from, ad, 300, to, 650, is, known, as, the, biblical, hand, it, went, back, to, at, least, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, and, had, had, originally, no, special, connection, with, christian, literature, in, both, vellum, and, paper, manuscripts, from, 4th, century, egypt, are, other, forms, of, script, particularly, a, sloping, rather, inelegant, hand, derived, from, the, literary, hand, of, the, 3rd, century, which, persisted, until, at, least, the, 5th, century, the, three, great, early, codices, of, the, bible, are, all, written, in, uncials, of, the, biblical, type, in, the, vaticanus, placed, during, the, 4th, century, the, characteristics, of, the, hand, are, least, strongly, marked, the, letters, have, the, forms, characteristic, of, the, type, but, without, the, heavy, appearance, of, later, manuscripts, and, the, general, impression, is, one, of, greater, roundness, in, the, sinaiticus, which, is, not, much, later, the, letters, are, larger, and, more, heavily, made, in, the, 5th, century, alexandrinus, a, later, development, is, seen, with, emphatic, distinction, of, thick, and, thin, strokes, by, the, 6th, century, alike, in, vellum, and, in, papyrus, manuscripts, the, heaviness, had, become, very, marked, though, the, hand, still, retained, in, its, best, examples, a, handsome, appearance, but, after, this, it, steadily, deteriorated, becoming, ever, more, mechanical, and, artificial, the, thick, strokes, grew, heavier, the, cross, strokes, of, t, and, and, the, base, of, were, furnished, with, drooping, spurs, the, hand, which, is, often, singularly, ugly, passed, through, various, modifications, now, sloping, now, upright, though, it, is, not, certain, that, these, variations, were, really, successive, rather, than, concurrent, a, different, type, of, uncials, derived, from, the, chancery, hand, and, seen, in, two, papyrus, examples, of, the, festal, letters, despatched, annually, by, the, patriarch, of, alexandria, was, occasionally, used, the, best, known, example, being, the, codex, marchalianus, 6th, or, 7th, century, a, combination, of, this, hand, with, the, other, type, is, also, known, the, uncial, hand, lingered, on, mainly, for, liturgical, manuscripts, where, a, large, and, easily, legible, script, was, serviceable, as, late, as, the, 12th, century, but, in, ordinary, use, it, had, long, been, superseded, by, a, new, type, of, hand, the, minuscule, which, originated, in, the, 8th, century, as, an, adaptation, to, literary, purposes, of, the, second, of, the, types, of, byzantine, cursive, mentioned, above, a, first, attempt, at, a, calligraphic, use, of, this, hand, seen, in, one, or, two, manuscripts, of, the, 8th, or, early, 9th, century, in, which, it, slopes, to, the, right, and, has, a, narrow, angular, appearance, did, not, find, favour, but, by, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, a, more, ornamental, type, from, which, modern, greek, script, descended, was, already, established, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, was, evolved, in, the, monastery, of, stoudios, at, constantinople, in, its, earliest, examples, it, is, upright, and, exact, but, lacks, flexibility, accents, are, small, breathings, square, in, formation, and, in, general, only, such, ligatures, are, used, as, involve, no, change, in, the, shape, of, letters, the, single, forms, have, a, general, resemblance, with, considerable, differences, in, detail, both, to, the, minuscule, cursive, of, late, papyri, and, to, those, used, in, modern, greek, type, uncial, forms, were, avoided, in, the, course, of, the, 10th, century, the, hand, without, losing, its, beauty, and, exactness, gained, in, freedom, its, finest, period, was, from, the, 9th, to, the, 12th, century, after, which, it, rapidly, declined, the, development, was, marked, by, a, tendency, but, from, the, first, there, were, several, styles, varying, from, the, formal, regular, hands, characteristic, of, service, books, to, the, informal, style, marked, by, numerous, abbreviations, used, in, manuscripts, intended, only, for, a, scholar, s, private, use, the, more, formal, hands, were, exceedingly, conservative, and, there, are, few, classes, of, script, more, difficult, to, date, than, the, greek, minuscule, of, this, class, in, the, 10th, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, a, sloping, hand, less, dignified, than, the, upright, formal, type, but, often, very, handsome, was, especially, used, for, manuscripts, of, the, classics, hands, of, the, 11th, century, are, marked, in, general, though, there, are, exceptions, by, a, certain, grace, and, delicacy, exact, but, easy, those, of, the, 12th, by, a, broad, bold, sweep, and, an, increasing, freedom, which, readily, admits, uncial, forms, ligatures, and, enlarged, letters, but, has, not, lost, the, sense, of, style, and, decorative, effect, in, the, 13th, and, still, more, in, the, 14th, centuries, there, was, a, steady, decline, the, less, formal, hands, lost, their, beauty, and, exactness, becoming, ever, more, disorderly, and, chaotic, in, their, effect, while, formal, style, imitated, the, precision, of, an, earlier, period, without, attaining, its, freedom, and, naturalness, and, often, appears, singularly, lifeless, in, the, 15th, century, especially, in, the, west, where, greek, scribes, were, in, request, to, produce, manuscripts, of, the, classical, authors, there, was, a, revival, and, several, manuscripts, of, this, period, though, markedly, inferior, to, those, of, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, are, by, no, means, without, beauty, in, the, book, hand, of, early, papyri, neither, accents, nor, breathings, were, employed, their, use, was, established, by, the, beginning, of, the, roman, period, but, was, sporadic, in, papyri, where, they, were, used, as, an, aid, to, understanding, and, therefore, more, frequently, in, poetry, than, prose, and, in, lyrical, oftener, than, in, other, verse, in, the, cursive, of, papyri, they, are, practically, unknown, as, are, marks, of, punctuation, punctuation, was, effected, in, early, papyri, literary, and, documentary, by, spaces, reinforced, in, the, book, hand, by, the, paragraphos, a, horizontal, stroke, under, the, beginning, of, the, line, the, coronis, a, more, elaborate, form, of, this, marked, the, beginning, of, lyrics, or, the, principal, sections, of, a, longer, work, punctuation, marks, the, comma, the, high, low, and, middle, points, were, established, in, the, book, hand, by, the, roman, period, in, early, ptolemaic, papyri, a, double, point, is, found, in, vellum, and, paper, manuscripts, punctuation, marks, and, accents, were, regularly, used, from, at, least, the, 8th, century, though, with, some, differences, from, modern, practice, at, no, period, down, to, the, invention, of, printing, did, greek, scribes, consistently, separate, words, the, book, hand, of, papyri, aimed, at, an, unbroken, succession, of, letters, except, for, distinction, of, sections, in, cursive, hands, especially, where, abbreviations, were, numerous, some, tendency, to, separate, words, may, be, recognised, but, in, reality, it, was, phrases, or, groups, of, letters, rather, than, words, which, were, divided, in, the, later, minuscule, word, division, is, much, commoner, but, never, became, systematic, accents, and, breathings, serving, of, themselves, to, indicate, the, proper, division, the, view, that, the, art, of, writing, in, india, developed, gradually, as, in, other, areas, of, the, world, by, going, through, the, stages, of, pictographic, ideographic, and, transitional, phases, of, the, phonetic, script, which, in, turn, developed, into, syllabic, and, alphabetic, scripts, was, challenged, by, falk, and, others, in, the, early, 1990s, in, the, new, paradigm, indian, alphabetic, writing, called, brahmi, was, discontinuous, with, earlier, undeciphered, glyphs, and, was, invented, specifically, by, king, ashoka, for, application, in, his, royal, edicts, 250, bc, in, the, subcontinent, kharosthi, clearly, derived, from, the, aramaic, alphabet, was, used, at, the, same, time, in, the, northwest, next, to, brahmi, at, least, influenced, by, aramaic, elsewhere, in, addition, the, greek, alphabet, were, also, added, to, the, indian, context, after, its, penetration, in, the, early, centuries, ad, with, the, arabic, alphabet, following, in, the, 13th, century, after, a, lapse, of, a, few, centuries, the, kharo, hi, script, became, obsolete, the, greek, script, in, india, went, through, a, similar, fate, and, disappeared, but, the, brahmi, and, arabic, scripts, endured, for, a, much, longer, period, moreover, there, was, a, change, and, development, in, the, brahmi, script, which, may, be, traced, in, time, and, space, through, the, maurya, ku, a, a, gupta, and, early, medieval, periods, the, present, day, n, gar, script, is, derived, from, brahmi, the, brahmi, is, also, the, ancestral, script, of, most, other, indian, scripts, in, northern, and, southern, south, asia, legends, and, inscriptions, in, brahmi, are, engraved, upon, leather, wood, terracotta, ivory, stone, copper, bronze, silver, and, gold, arabic, got, an, important, place, particularly, in, the, royalty, during, the, medieval, period, and, it, provides, rich, material, for, history, writing, the, decipherment, and, subsequent, development, of, indus, glyphs, is, also, a, matter, for, continuing, research, and, discussion, most, of, the, available, inscriptions, and, manuscripts, written, in, the, above, scripts, in, languages, like, prakrit, pali, sanskrit, apabhra, a, tamil, and, persian, have, been, read, and, exploited, for, history, writing, but, numerous, inscriptions, preserved, in, different, museums, still, remain, undeciphered, for, lack, of, competent, palaeographic, indologists, as, there, is, a, gradual, decline, in, the, subcontinent, of, such, disciplines, as, palaeography, epigraphy, and, numismatics, the, discipline, of, ancient, indian, scripts, and, the, languages, they, are, written, needs, new, scholars, who, by, adopting, traditional, palaeographic, methods, and, modern, technology, may, decipher, study, and, transcribe, the, various, types, of, epigraphs, and, legends, still, extant, today, the, language, of, the, earliest, written, records, that, is, the, edicts, of, ashoka, is, prakrit, besides, prakrit, the, ashokan, edicts, are, also, written, in, greek, and, aramaic, moreover, all, the, edicts, of, ashoka, engraved, in, the, kharoshthi, and, brahmi, scripts, are, in, the, prakrit, language, thus, originally, the, language, employed, in, the, inscriptions, was, prakrit, with, sanskrit, adopted, at, a, later, stage, past, the, period, of, the, maurya, empire, the, use, of, prakrit, continued, in, inscriptions, for, a, few, more, centuries, in, north, india, prakrit, was, replaced, by, sanskrit, by, the, end, of, the, 3rd, century, while, this, change, took, place, about, a, century, later, in, south, india, some, of, the, inscriptions, though, written, in, prakrit, were, influenced, by, sanskrit, and, vice, versa, the, epigraphs, of, the, kushana, kings, are, found, in, a, mixture, of, prakrit, and, sanskrit, while, the, mathura, inscriptions, of, the, time, of, sodasa, belonging, to, the, first, quarter, of, the, 1st, century, contain, verses, in, classical, sanskrit, from, the, 4th, century, onwards, the, gupta, empire, came, to, power, and, supported, the, sanskrit, language, and, literature, in, western, india, and, also, in, some, regions, of, andhra, pradesh, and, karnataka, prakrit, was, used, till, the, 4th, century, mostly, in, the, buddhist, writings, though, in, a, few, contemporary, records, of, the, ikshvakus, of, nagarjunakonda, sanskrit, was, applied, the, inscription, of, yajna, sri, satakarni, 2nd, century, from, amaravati, is, considered, to, be, the, earliest, so, far, the, earlier, writings, 4th, century, of, salankayanas, of, the, telugu, region, are, in, prakrit, while, their, later, records, belonging, to, the, 5th, century, are, written, in, sanskrit, in, the, kannada, speaking, area, inscriptions, belonging, to, later, satavahanas, and, chutus, were, written, in, prakrit, from, the, 4th, century, onwards, with, the, rise, of, the, guptas, sanskrit, became, the, predominant, language, of, india, and, continued, to, be, employed, in, texts, and, inscriptions, of, all, parts, of, india, along, with, the, regional, languages, in, the, subsequent, centuries, the, copper, plate, charters, of, the, pallavas, the, cholas, and, the, pandyas, documents, are, written, in, both, sanskrit, and, tamil, kannada, is, used, in, texts, dating, from, about, the, 5th, century, and, the, halmidi, inscription, is, considered, to, be, the, earliest, epigraph, written, in, the, kannada, language, inscriptions, in, telugu, began, to, appear, from, the, 6th, or, 7th, century, malayalam, made, its, beginning, in, writings, from, the, 15th, century, onwards, in, north, india, the, brahmi, script, was, used, over, a, vast, area, however, ashokan, inscriptions, are, also, found, using, kharoshthi, aramaic, and, greek, scripts, with, the, advent, of, the, saka, kshatrapas, and, the, kushanas, as, political, powers, in, north, india, the, writing, system, underwent, a, definite, change, due, to, the, use, of, new, writing, tools, and, techniques, further, development, of, the, brahmi, script, and, perceivable, changes, in, its, evolutionary, trend, can, be, discerned, during, the, gupta, period, in, fact, the, gupta, script, is, considered, to, be, the, successor, of, the, kushana, script, in, north, india, from, the, 6th, to, about, the, 10th, century, the, inscriptions, in, north, india, were, written, in, a, script, variously, named, e, g, siddhamatrika, and, kutila, ra, jan, script, from, the, 8th, century, siddhamatrika, developed, into, the, rad, script, in, kashmir, and, punjab, into, proto, bengali, or, gaudi, in, bengal, and, orissa, and, into, nagari, in, other, parts, of, north, india, nagari, script, was, used, widely, in, northern, india, from, the, 10th, century, onwards, the, use, of, nandinagari, a, variant, of, nagari, script, is, mostly, confined, to, the, karnataka, region, in, central, india, mostly, in, madhya, pradesh, the, inscriptions, of, the, vakatakas, and, the, kings, of, sarabhapura, and, kosala, were, written, in, what, are, known, as, box, headed, and, nail, headed, characters, it, may, be, noted, that, the, early, kadambas, of, karnataka, also, employed, nail, headed, characters, in, some, of, their, inscriptions, during, the, 3rd, 4th, century, the, script, used, in, the, inscriptions, of, ikshvakus, of, nagarjunakonda, developed, a, unique, style, of, letter, forms, with, elongated, verticals, and, artistic, flourishes, which, did, not, continue, after, their, rule, the, earliest, attested, form, of, writing, in, south, india, is, represented, by, inscriptions, found, in, caves, associated, with, the, chalukya, and, chera, dynasties, these, are, written, in, variants, of, what, is, known, as, the, cave, character, and, their, script, differs, from, the, northern, version, in, being, more, angular, most, of, the, modern, scripts, of, south, india, have, evolved, from, this, script, with, the, exception, of, vatteluttu, the, exact, origins, of, which, are, unknown, and, nandinagari, which, is, a, variant, of, devanagari, that, developed, due, to, later, northern, influence, in, south, india, from, the, 7th, century, of, the, common, era, onwards, a, number, of, inscriptions, belonging, to, the, dynasties, of, pallava, chola, and, pandya, are, found, these, records, are, written, in, three, different, scripts, known, as, tamil, vattezhuttu, and, grantha, scripts, the, last, variety, being, used, to, write, sanskrit, inscriptions, in, the, kerala, region, the, vattezhuttu, script, developed, into, a, still, more, cursive, script, called, kolezhuthu, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, at, the, same, time, the, modern, malayalam, script, developed, out, of, the, grantha, script, the, early, form, of, the, telugu, kannada, script, is, found, in, the, inscriptions, of, the, early, kadambas, of, banavasi, and, the, early, chalukyas, of, badami, in, the, west, and, salankayana, and, the, early, eastern, chalukyas, in, the, east, who, ruled, the, kannada, and, telugu, speaking, areas, respectively, during, the, 4th, to, 7th, centuries, attention, should, be, drawn, at, the, outset, to, certain, fundamental, definitions, and, principles, of, the, science, the, original, characters, of, an, alphabet, are, modified, by, the, material, and, the, implements, used, when, stone, and, chisel, are, discarded, for, papyrus, and, reed, pen, the, hand, encounters, less, resistance, and, moves, more, rapidly, this, leads, to, changes, in, the, size, and, position, of, the, letters, and, then, to, the, joining, of, letters, and, consequently, to, altered, shapes, we, are, thus, confronted, at, an, early, date, with, quite, distinct, types, the, majuscule, style, of, writing, based, on, two, parallel, lines, adpl, is, opposed, to, the, minuscule, based, on, a, system, of, four, lines, with, letters, of, unequal, height, adpl, another, classification, according, to, the, care, taken, in, forming, the, letters, distinguishes, between, the, set, book, hand, and, the, cursive, script, the, difference, in, this, case, is, determined, by, the, subject, matter, of, the, text, the, writing, used, for, books, scriptura, libraria, is, in, all, periods, quite, distinct, from, that, used, for, letters, and, documents, epistolaris, diplomatica, while, the, set, book, hand, in, majuscule, or, minuscule, shows, a, tendency, to, stabilise, the, forms, of, the, letters, the, cursive, often, carelessly, written, is, continually, changing, in, the, course, of, years, and, according, to, the, preferences, of, the, writers, this, being, granted, a, summary, survey, of, the, morphological, history, of, the, latin, alphabet, shows, the, zenith, of, its, modifications, at, once, for, its, history, is, divided, into, two, very, unequal, periods, the, first, dominated, by, majuscule, and, the, second, by, minuscule, writing, jean, mabillon, a, french, benedictine, monk, scholar, and, antiquary, whose, work, de, re, diplomatica, was, published, in, 1681, is, widely, regarded, as, the, founder, of, the, twin, disciplines, of, palaeography, and, diplomatics, however, the, actual, term, palaeography, was, coined, in, latin, by, bernard, de, montfaucon, a, benedictine, monk, in, the, title, of, his, palaeographia, graeca, 1708, which, remained, a, standard, work, in, the, specific, field, of, greek, palaeography, for, more, than, a, century, with, their, establishment, of, palaeography, mabillon, and, his, fellow, benedictines, were, responding, to, the, jesuit, daniel, papebroch, who, doubted, the, authenticity, of, some, of, the, documents, which, the, benedictines, offered, as, credentials, for, the, authorisation, of, their, monasteries, in, the, 19th, century, such, scholars, as, wilhelm, wattenbach, leopold, delisle, and, ludwig, traube, contributed, greatly, to, making, palaeography, independent, from, diplomatic, in, the, 20th, century, the, new, french, school, of, palaeographers, especially, jean, mallon, gave, a, new, direction, to, the, study, of, scripts, by, stressing, the, importance, of, ductus, the, shape, and, order, of, the, strokes, used, to, compose, letters, in, studying, the, historical, development, of, scripts, the, latin, alphabet, first, appears, in, the, epigraphic, type, of, majuscule, writing, known, as, capitals, these, characters, form, the, main, stem, from, which, developed, all, the, branches, of, latin, writing, on, the, oldest, monuments, the, inscriptiones, bello, hannibalico, antiquiores, of, the, corpus, inscriptionum, latinarum, cil, it, is, far, from, showing, the, orderly, regularity, of, the, later, period, side, by, side, with, upright, and, square, characters, are, angular, and, sloping, forms, sometimes, very, distorted, which, seem, to, indicate, the, existence, of, an, early, cursive, writing, from, which, they, would, have, been, borrowed, certain, literary, texts, clearly, allude, to, such, a, hand, later, the, characters, of, the, cursive, type, were, progressively, eliminated, from, formal, inscriptions, and, capital, writing, reached, its, perfection, in, the, augustan, age, epigraphists, divide, the, numerous, inscriptions, of, this, period, into, two, quite, distinct, classes, tituli, or, formal, inscriptions, engraved, on, stone, in, elegant, and, regular, capitals, and, acta, or, legal, texts, documents, etc, generally, engraved, on, bronze, in, cramped, and, careless, capitals, palaeography, inherits, both, these, types, reproduced, by, scribes, on, papyrus, or, parchment, the, elegant, characters, of, the, inscriptions, become, the, square, capitals, of, the, manuscripts, and, the, actuaria, as, the, writing, of, the, acta, is, called, becomes, the, rustic, capital, of, the, many, books, written, in, square, capitals, the, ditions, de, luxe, of, ancient, times, only, a, few, fragments, have, survived, the, most, famous, being, pages, from, manuscripts, of, virgil, the, finest, examples, of, rustic, capitals, the, use, of, which, is, attested, by, papyri, of, the, 1st, century, are, to, be, found, in, manuscripts, of, virgil, and, terence, neither, of, these, forms, of, capital, writing, offers, any, difficulty, in, reading, except, that, no, space, is, left, between, the, words, their, dates, are, still, uncertain, in, spite, of, attempts, to, determine, them, by, minute, observation, the, rustic, capitals, more, practical, than, the, square, forms, soon, came, into, general, use, this, was, the, standard, form, of, writing, so, far, as, books, are, concerned, until, the, 5th, century, when, it, was, replaced, by, a, new, type, the, uncial, which, is, discussed, below, while, the, set, book, hand, in, square, or, rustic, capitals, was, used, for, the, copying, of, books, the, writing, of, everyday, life, letters, and, documents, of, all, kinds, was, in, a, cursive, form, the, oldest, examples, of, which, are, provided, by, the, graffiti, on, walls, at, pompeii, cil, iv, a, series, of, waxen, tablets, also, discovered, at, pompeii, cil, iv, supplement, a, similar, series, found, at, verespatak, in, transylvania, cil, iii, and, a, number, of, papyri, from, a, study, of, a, number, of, documents, which, exhibit, transitional, forms, it, appears, that, this, cursive, was, originally, simplified, capital, writing, the, evolution, was, so, rapid, however, that, at, quite, an, early, date, the, scriptura, epistolaris, of, the, roman, world, can, no, longer, be, described, as, capitals, by, the, 1st, century, this, kind, of, writing, began, to, develop, the, principal, characteristics, of, two, new, types, the, uncial, and, the, minuscule, cursive, with, the, coming, into, use, of, writing, surfaces, which, were, smooth, or, offered, little, resistance, the, unhampered, haste, of, the, writer, altered, the, shape, size, and, position, of, the, letters, in, the, earliest, specimens, of, writing, on, wax, plaster, or, papyrus, there, appears, a, tendency, to, represent, several, straight, strokes, by, a, single, curve, the, cursive, writing, thus, foreshadows, the, specifically, uncial, forms, the, same, specimens, show, great, inequality, in, the, height, of, the, letters, the, main, strokes, are, prolonged, upwards, b, d, or, downwards, q, s, in, this, direction, the, cursive, tends, to, become, a, minuscule, hand, although, the, characteristic, forms, of, the, uncial, type, appear, to, have, their, origin, in, the, early, cursive, the, two, hands, are, nevertheless, quite, distinct, the, uncial, is, a, libraria, closely, related, to, the, capital, writing, from, which, it, differs, only, in, the, rounding, off, of, the, angles, of, certain, letters, principally, it, represents, a, compromise, between, the, beauty, and, legibility, of, the, capitals, and, the, rapidity, of, the, cursive, and, is, clearly, an, artificial, product, it, was, certainly, in, existence, by, the, latter, part, of, the, 4th, century, for, a, number, of, manuscripts, of, that, date, are, written, in, perfect, uncial, hands, exempla, pl, xx, it, presently, supplanted, the, capitals, and, appears, in, numerous, manuscripts, which, have, survived, from, the, 5th, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, when, it, was, at, its, height, by, this, time, it, had, become, an, imitative, hand, in, which, there, was, generally, no, room, for, spontaneous, development, it, remained, noticeably, uniform, over, a, long, period, it, is, difficult, therefore, to, date, the, manuscripts, by, palaeographical, criteria, alone, the, most, that, can, be, done, is, to, classify, them, by, centuries, on, the, strength, of, tenuous, data, the, earliest, uncial, writing, is, easily, distinguished, by, its, simple, and, monumental, character, from, the, later, hands, which, become, progressively, stiff, and, affected, in, the, ancient, cursive, writing, from, the, 1st, century, onward, there, are, symptoms, of, transformation, in, the, form, of, certain, letters, the, shape, and, proportions, of, which, correspond, more, closely, to, the, definition, of, minuscule, writing, than, to, that, of, majuscule, rare, and, irregular, at, first, they, gradually, become, more, numerous, and, more, constant, and, by, degrees, supplant, the, majuscule, forms, so, that, in, the, history, of, the, roman, cursive, there, is, no, precise, boundary, between, the, majuscule, and, minuscule, periods, the, oldest, example, of, minuscule, cursive, writing, that, has, been, discovered, is, a, letter, on, papyrus, found, in, egypt, dating, from, the, 4th, century, this, marks, a, highly, important, date, in, the, history, of, latin, writing, for, with, only, one, known, exception, not, yet, adequately, explained, two, fragments, of, imperial, rescripts, of, the, 5th, century, the, minuscule, cursive, was, consequently, the, only, scriptura, epistolaris, of, the, roman, world, the, ensuing, succession, of, documents, show, a, continuous, improvement, in, this, form, of, writing, characterised, by, the, boldness, of, the, strokes, and, by, the, elimination, of, the, last, lingering, majuscule, forms, the, ravenna, deeds, of, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, exhibit, this, hand, at, its, perfection, at, this, period, the, minuscule, cursive, made, its, appearance, as, a, book, hand, first, as, marginal, notes, and, later, for, the, complete, books, themselves, the, only, difference, between, the, book, hand, and, that, used, for, documents, is, that, the, principal, strokes, are, shorter, and, the, characters, thicker, this, form, of, the, hand, is, usually, called, semi, cursive, the, fall, of, the, empire, and, the, establishment, of, the, barbarians, within, its, former, boundaries, did, not, interrupt, the, use, of, the, roman, minuscule, cursive, hand, which, was, adopted, by, the, newcomers, but, for, gaps, of, over, a, century, in, the, chronological, series, of, documents, which, have, been, preserved, it, would, be, possible, to, follow, the, evolution, of, the, roman, cursive, into, the, so, called, national, hands, forms, of, minuscule, writing, which, flourished, after, the, barbarian, invasions, in, italy, france, spain, england, and, ireland, and, which, are, still, known, as, lombardic, merovingian, visigothic, anglo, saxon, and, irish, these, names, came, into, use, at, a, time, when, the, various, national, hands, were, believed, to, have, been, invented, by, the, peoples, who, used, them, but, their, connotation, is, merely, geographical, nevertheless, in, spite, of, a, close, resemblance, which, betrays, their, common, origin, these, hands, are, specifically, different, perhaps, because, the, roman, cursive, was, developed, by, each, nation, in, accordance, with, its, artistic, tradition, in, italy, after, the, close, of, the, roman, and, byzantine, periods, the, writing, is, known, as, lombardic, a, generic, term, which, comprises, several, local, varieties, these, may, be, classified, under, four, principal, types, two, for, the, scriptura, epistolaris, the, old, italian, cursive, and, the, papal, chancery, hand, or, littera, romana, and, two, for, the, libraria, the, old, italian, book, hand, and, lombardic, in, the, narrow, sense, sometimes, known, as, beneventana, because, it, flourished, in, the, principality, of, benevento, the, oldest, preserved, documents, written, in, the, old, italian, cursive, show, all, the, essential, characteristics, of, the, roman, cursive, of, the, 6th, century, in, northern, italy, this, hand, began, in, the, 9th, century, to, be, influenced, by, a, minuscule, book, hand, which, developed, as, will, be, seen, later, in, the, time, of, charlemagne, under, this, influence, it, gradually, disappeared, and, ceased, to, exist, in, the, course, of, the, 12th, century, in, southern, italy, it, persisted, far, on, into, the, later, middle, ages, the, papal, chancery, hand, a, variety, of, lombardic, peculiar, to, the, vicinity, of, rome, and, principally, used, in, papal, documents, is, distinguished, by, the, formation, of, the, letters, a, e, q, t, it, is, formal, in, appearance, at, first, but, is, gradually, simplified, under, the, influence, of, the, carolingian, minuscule, which, finally, prevailed, in, the, bulls, of, honorius, ii, 1124, 1130, the, notaries, public, in, rome, continued, to, use, the, papal, chancery, hand, until, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, the, old, italian, book, hand, is, simply, a, semi, cursive, of, the, type, already, described, as, in, use, in, the, 6th, century, the, principal, examples, are, derived, from, scriptoria, in, northern, italy, where, it, was, displaced, by, the, carolingian, minuscule, during, the, 9th, century, in, southern, italy, this, hand, persisted, developing, into, a, calligraphic, form, of, writing, and, in, the, 10th, century, took, on, a, very, artistic, angular, appearance, the, exultet, rolls, provide, the, finest, examples, in, the, 9th, century, it, was, introduced, in, dalmatia, by, the, benedictine, monks, and, developed, there, as, in, apulia, on, the, basis, of, the, archetype, culminating, in, a, rounded, beneventana, known, as, the, bari, type, the, offshoot, of, the, roman, cursive, which, developed, in, gaul, under, the, first, dynasty, of, kings, is, called, merovingian, writing, it, is, represented, by, thirty, eight, royal, diplomas, a, number, of, private, charters, and, the, authenticating, documents, of, relics, though, less, than, a, century, intervenes, between, the, ravenna, cursive, and, the, oldest, extant, merovingian, document, ad, 625, there, is, a, great, difference, in, appearance, between, the, two, writings, the, facile, flow, of, the, former, is, replaced, by, a, cramped, style, in, which, the, natural, slope, to, the, right, gives, way, to, an, upright, hand, and, the, letters, instead, of, being, fully, outlined, are, compressed, to, such, an, extent, that, they, modify, the, shape, of, other, letters, copyists, of, books, used, a, cursive, similar, to, that, found, in, documents, except, that, the, strokes, are, thicker, the, forms, more, regular, and, the, heads, and, tails, shorter, the, merovingian, cursive, as, used, in, books, underwent, simplification, in, some, localities, undoubtedly, through, the, influence, of, the, minuscule, book, hand, of, the, period, the, two, principal, centres, of, this, reform, were, luxeuil, and, corbie, in, spain, after, the, visigothic, conquest, the, roman, cursive, gradually, developed, special, characteristics, some, documents, attributed, to, the, 7th, century, display, a, transitional, hand, with, straggling, and, rather, uncouth, forms, the, distinctive, features, of, visigothic, writing, the, most, noticeable, of, which, is, certainly, the, q, shaped, g, did, not, appear, until, later, in, the, book, hand, the, book, hand, became, set, at, an, early, date, in, the, 8th, century, it, appears, as, a, sort, of, semi, cursive, the, earliest, example, of, certain, date, is, ms, lxxxix, in, the, capitular, library, in, verona, from, the, 9th, century, the, calligraphic, forms, become, broader, and, more, rounded, until, the, 11th, century, when, they, become, slender, and, angular, the, visigothic, minuscule, appears, in, a, cursive, form, in, documents, about, the, middle, of, the, 9th, century, and, in, the, course, of, time, grows, more, intricate, and, consequently, less, legible, it, soon, came, into, competition, with, the, carolingian, minuscule, which, supplanted, it, as, a, result, of, the, presence, in, spain, of, french, elements, such, as, cluniac, monks, and, warriors, engaged, in, the, campaign, against, the, moors, the, irish, and, anglo, saxon, hands, which, were, not, directly, derived, from, the, roman, minuscule, cursive, will, be, discussed, in, a, separate, sub, section, below, one, by, one, the, national, minuscule, cursive, hands, were, replaced, by, a, set, minuscule, hand, which, has, already, been, mentioned, and, its, origins, may, now, be, traced, from, the, beginning, the, early, cursive, was, the, medium, in, which, the, minuscule, forms, were, gradually, evolved, from, the, corresponding, majuscule, forms, minuscule, writing, was, therefore, cursive, in, its, inception, as, the, minuscule, letters, made, their, appearance, in, the, cursive, writing, of, documents, they, were, adopted, and, given, calligraphic, form, by, the, copyists, of, literary, texts, so, that, the, set, minuscule, alphabet, was, constituted, gradually, letter, by, letter, following, the, development, of, the, minuscule, cursive, just, as, some, documents, written, in, the, early, cursive, show, a, mixture, of, majuscule, and, minuscule, forms, so, certain, literary, papyri, of, the, 3rd, century, and, inscriptions, on, stone, of, the, 4th, century, yield, examples, of, a, mixed, set, hand, with, minuscule, forms, side, by, side, with, capital, and, uncial, letters, the, number, of, minuscule, forms, increases, steadily, in, texts, written, in, the, mixed, hand, and, especially, in, marginal, notes, until, by, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, the, majuscule, forms, have, almost, entirely, disappeared, in, some, manuscripts, this, quasi, minuscule, writing, known, as, the, half, uncial, thus, derives, from, a, long, line, of, mixed, hands, which, in, a, synoptic, chart, of, latin, scripts, would, appear, close, to, the, oldest, librariae, and, between, them, and, the, epistolaris, cursive, from, which, its, characteristic, forms, were, successively, derived, it, had, a, considerable, influence, on, the, continental, scriptura, libraria, of, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, the, half, uncial, hand, was, introduced, in, ireland, along, with, latin, culture, in, the, 5th, century, by, priests, and, laymen, from, gaul, fleeing, before, the, barbarian, invasions, it, was, adopted, there, to, the, exclusion, of, the, cursive, and, soon, took, on, a, distinct, character, there, are, two, well, established, classes, of, irish, writing, as, early, as, the, 7th, century, a, large, round, half, uncial, hand, in, which, certain, majuscule, forms, frequently, appear, and, a, pointed, hand, which, becomes, more, cursive, and, more, genuinely, minuscule, the, latter, developed, out, of, the, former, one, of, the, distinguishing, marks, of, manuscripts, of, irish, origin, is, to, be, found, in, the, initial, letters, which, are, ornamented, by, interlacing, animal, forms, or, a, frame, of, red, dots, the, most, certain, evidence, however, is, provided, by, the, system, of, abbreviations, and, by, the, combined, square, and, cuneiform, appearance, of, the, minuscule, at, the, height, of, its, development, the, two, types, of, irish, writing, were, introduced, in, the, north, of, great, britain, by, the, monks, and, were, soon, adopted, by, the, anglo, saxons, being, so, exactly, copied, that, it, is, sometimes, difficult, to, determine, the, origin, of, an, example, gradually, however, the, anglo, saxon, writing, developed, a, distinct, style, and, even, local, types, which, were, superseded, after, the, norman, conquest, by, the, carolingian, minuscule, through, st, columbanus, and, his, followers, irish, writing, spread, to, the, continent, and, manuscripts, were, written, in, the, irish, hand, in, the, monasteries, of, bobbio, abbey, and, st, gall, during, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, james, j, john, points, out, that, the, disappearance, of, imperial, authority, around, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, in, most, of, the, latin, speaking, half, of, the, roman, empire, does, not, entail, the, disappearance, of, the, latin, scripts, but, rather, introduced, conditions, that, would, allow, the, various, provinces, of, the, west, gradually, to, drift, apart, in, their, writing, habits, a, process, that, began, around, the, 7th, century, pope, gregory, i, gregory, the, great, d, 604, was, influential, in, the, spread, of, christianity, to, britain, and, also, sent, queens, theodelinde, and, brunhilda, as, well, as, spanish, bishops, copies, of, manuscripts, furthermore, he, sent, the, roman, monk, augustine, of, canterbury, to, britain, on, a, missionary, journey, on, which, augustine, may, have, brought, manuscripts, although, italy, s, dominance, as, a, centre, of, manuscript, production, began, to, decline, especially, after, the, gothic, war, 535, 554, and, the, invasions, by, the, lombards, its, manuscripts, and, more, important, the, scripts, in, which, they, were, written, were, distributed, across, europe, from, the, 6th, through, the, 8th, centuries, a, number, of, so, called, national, hands, were, developed, throughout, the, latin, speaking, areas, of, the, former, roman, empire, by, the, late, 6th, century, irish, scribes, had, begun, transforming, roman, scripts, into, insular, minuscule, and, majuscule, scripts, a, series, of, transformations, for, book, purposes, of, the, cursive, documentary, script, that, had, grown, out, of, the, later, roman, cursive, would, get, under, way, in, france, by, the, mid, 7th, century, in, spain, half, uncial, and, cursive, would, both, be, transformed, into, a, new, script, the, visigothic, minuscule, no, later, than, the, early, 8th, century, beginning, in, the, 8th, century, as, charlemagne, began, to, consolidate, power, over, a, large, area, of, western, europe, scribes, developed, a, minuscule, script, caroline, minuscule, that, effectively, became, the, standard, script, for, manuscripts, from, the, 9th, to, the, 11th, centuries, the, origin, of, this, hand, is, much, disputed, this, is, due, to, the, confusion, which, prevailed, before, the, carolingian, period, in, the, libraria, in, france, italy, and, germany, as, a, result, of, the, competition, between, the, cursive, and, the, set, hands, in, addition, to, the, calligraphic, uncial, and, half, uncial, writings, which, were, imitative, forms, little, used, and, consequently, without, much, vitality, and, the, minuscule, cursive, which, was, the, most, natural, hand, there, were, innumerable, varieties, of, mixed, writing, derived, from, the, influence, of, these, hands, on, each, other, in, some, the, uncial, or, half, uncial, forms, were, preserved, with, little, or, no, modification, but, the, influence, of, the, cursive, is, shown, by, the, freedom, of, the, strokes, these, are, known, as, rustic, semi, cursive, or, cursive, uncial, or, half, uncial, hands, conversely, the, cursive, was, sometimes, affected, in, varying, degrees, by, the, set, librariae, the, cursive, of, the, epistolaris, became, a, semi, cursive, when, adopted, as, a, libraria, nor, is, this, all, apart, from, these, reciprocal, influences, affecting, the, movement, of, the, hand, across, the, page, there, were, morphological, influences, at, work, letters, being, borrowed, from, one, alphabet, for, another, this, led, to, compromises, of, all, sorts, and, of, infinite, variety, between, the, uncial, and, half, uncial, and, the, cursive, it, will, readily, be, understood, that, the, origin, of, the, carolingian, minuscule, which, must, be, sought, in, this, tangle, of, pre, carolingian, hands, involves, disagreement, the, new, writing, is, admittedly, much, more, closely, related, to, the, epistolaris, than, the, primitive, minuscule, this, is, shown, by, certain, forms, such, as, the, open, a, which, recall, the, cursive, by, the, joining, of, certain, letters, and, by, the, clubbing, of, the, tall, letters, b, d, h, l, which, resulted, from, a, cursive, ductus, most, palaeographers, agree, in, assigning, the, new, hand, the, place, shown, in, the, following, table, controversy, turns, on, the, question, whether, the, carolingian, minuscule, is, the, primitive, minuscule, as, modified, by, the, influence, of, the, cursive, or, a, cursive, based, on, the, primitive, minuscule, its, place, of, origin, is, also, uncertain, rome, the, palatine, school, tours, reims, metz, saint, denis, and, corbie, have, been, suggested, but, no, agreement, has, been, reached, in, any, case, the, appearance, of, the, new, hand, is, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, culture, so, far, as, latin, writing, is, concerned, it, marks, the, dawn, of, modern, times, in, the, 12th, century, carolingian, minuscule, underwent, a, change, in, its, appearance, and, adopted, bold, and, broken, gothic, letter, forms, this, style, remained, predominant, with, some, regional, variants, until, the, 15th, century, when, the, renaissance, humanistic, scripts, revived, a, version, of, carolingian, minuscule, it, then, spread, from, the, italian, renaissance, all, over, europe, these, humanistic, scripts, are, the, base, for, the, antiqua, and, the, handwriting, forms, in, western, and, southern, europe, in, germany, and, austria, the, kurrentschrift, was, rooted, in, the, cursive, handwriting, of, the, later, middle, ages, with, the, name, of, the, calligrapher, ludwig, s, tterlin, this, handwriting, counterpart, to, the, blackletter, typefaces, was, abolished, by, hitler, in, 1941, after, world, war, ii, it, was, taught, as, an, alternative, script, in, some, areas, until, the, 1970s, it, is, no, longer, taught, secretary, hand, is, an, informal, business, hand, of, the, renaissance, there, are, undeniable, points, of, contact, between, architecture, and, palaeography, and, in, both, it, is, possible, to, distinguish, a, romanesque, and, a, gothic, period, the, creative, effort, which, began, in, the, post, carolingian, period, culminated, at, the, beginning, of, the, 12th, century, in, a, calligraphy, and, an, architecture, which, though, still, somewhat, awkward, showed, unmistakable, signs, of, power, and, experience, and, at, the, end, of, that, century, and, in, the, first, half, of, the, 13th, both, arts, reached, their, climax, and, made, their, boldest, flights, the, topography, of, later, medieval, writing, is, still, being, studied, national, varieties, can, of, course, be, identified, but, the, problem, of, distinguishing, features, becomes, complicated, as, a, result, of, the, development, of, international, relations, and, the, migration, of, clerks, from, one, end, of, europe, to, the, other, during, the, later, centuries, of, the, middle, ages, the, gothic, minuscule, continued, to, improve, within, the, restricted, circle, of, de, luxe, editions, and, ceremonial, documents, in, common, use, it, degenerated, into, a, cursive, which, became, more, and, more, intricate, full, of, superfluous, strokes, and, complicated, by, abbreviations, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, 15th, century, an, innovation, took, place, which, exercised, a, decisive, influence, on, the, evolution, of, writing, in, europe, the, italian, humanists, were, struck, by, the, eminent, legibility, of, the, manuscripts, written, in, the, improved, carolingian, minuscule, of, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, in, which, they, discovered, the, works, of, ancient, authors, and, carefully, imitated, the, old, writing, in, petrarch, s, compact, book, hand, the, wider, leading, and, reduced, compression, and, round, curves, are, early, manifestations, of, the, reaction, against, the, crabbed, gothic, secretarial, minuscule, we, know, today, as, blackletter, petrarch, was, one, of, the, few, medieval, authors, to, have, written, at, any, length, on, the, handwriting, of, his, time, in, his, essay, on, the, subject, la, scrittura, he, criticized, the, current, scholastic, hand, with, its, laboured, strokes, artificiosis, litterarum, tractibus, and, exuberant, luxurians, letter, forms, amusing, the, eye, from, a, distance, but, fatiguing, on, closer, exposure, as, if, written, for, other, purpose, than, to, be, read, for, petrarch, the, gothic, hand, violated, three, principles, writing, he, said, should, be, simple, castigata, clear, clara, and, orthographically, correct, boccaccio, was, a, great, admirer, of, petrarch, from, boccaccio, s, immediate, circle, this, post, petrarchan, semi, gothic, revised, hand, spread, to, literati, in, florence, lombardy, and, the, veneto, a, more, thorough, reform, of, handwriting, than, the, petrarchan, compromise, was, in, the, offing, the, generator, of, the, new, style, illustration, was, poggio, bracciolini, a, tireless, pursuer, of, ancient, manuscripts, who, developed, the, new, humanist, script, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 15th, century, the, florentine, bookseller, vespasiano, da, bisticci, recalled, later, in, the, century, that, poggio, had, been, a, very, fine, calligrapher, of, lettera, antica, and, had, transcribed, texts, to, support, himself, presumably, as, martin, davies, points, out, before, he, went, to, rome, in, 1403, to, begin, his, career, in, the, papal, curia, berthold, ullman, identifies, the, watershed, moment, in, the, development, of, the, new, humanistic, hand, as, the, youthful, poggio, s, transcription, of, cicero, s, epistles, to, atticus, by, the, time, the, medici, library, was, catalogued, in, 1418, almost, half, the, manuscripts, were, noted, as, in, the, lettera, antica, the, new, script, was, embraced, and, developed, by, the, florentine, humanists, and, educators, niccol, de, niccoli, and, coluccio, salutati, the, papal, chancery, adopted, the, new, fashion, for, some, purposes, and, thus, contributed, to, its, diffusion, throughout, christendom, the, printers, played, a, still, more, significant, part, in, establishing, this, form, of, writing, by, using, it, from, the, year, 1465, as, the, basis, for, their, types, the, humanistic, minuscule, soon, gave, rise, to, a, sloping, cursive, hand, known, as, the, italian, which, was, also, taken, up, by, printers, in, search, of, novelty, and, thus, became, the, italic, type, in, consequence, the, italian, hand, became, widely, used, and, in, the, 16th, century, began, to, compete, with, the, gothic, cursive, in, the, 17th, century, writing, masters, were, divided, between, the, two, schools, and, there, was, in, addition, a, whole, series, of, compromises, the, gothic, characters, gradually, disappeared, except, a, few, that, survived, in, germany, the, italian, became, universally, used, brought, to, perfection, in, more, recent, times, by, english, calligraphers
