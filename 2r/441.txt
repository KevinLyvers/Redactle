decolonization, is, the, undoing, of, colonialism, the, latter, being, the, process, whereby, imperial, nations, establish, and, dominate, foreign, territories, often, overseas, the, meanings, and, applications, of, the, term, are, disputed, some, scholars, of, decolonization, focus, especially, on, independence, movements, in, the, colonies, and, the, collapse, of, global, colonial, empires, as, a, movement, to, establish, independence, for, colonized, territories, from, their, respective, metropoles, decolonization, began, in, 1775, in, north, america, major, waves, of, decolonization, occurred, in, the, aftermath, of, the, first, world, war, and, most, prominently, after, the, second, world, war, critical, scholars, extend, the, meaning, beyond, independence, or, equal, rights, for, colonized, peoples, to, include, broader, economic, cultural, and, psychological, aspects, of, the, colonial, experience, extending, the, meaning, of, decolonization, beyond, political, independence, has, been, disputed, and, received, criticism, the, united, nations, un, states, that, the, fundamental, right, to, self, determination, is, the, core, requirement, for, decolonization, and, that, this, right, can, be, exercised, with, or, without, political, independence, a, un, general, assembly, resolution, in, 1960, characterised, colonial, foreign, rule, as, a, violation, of, human, rights, in, states, that, have, won, independence, indigenous, people, living, under, settler, colonialism, continue, to, make, demands, for, decolonization, and, self, determination, although, discussions, of, hegemony, and, power, central, to, the, concept, of, decolonization, can, be, found, as, early, as, the, writings, of, thucydides, there, have, been, several, particularly, active, periods, of, decolonization, in, modern, times, these, include, the, decolonization, of, africa, the, breakup, of, the, spanish, empire, in, the, 19th, century, of, the, german, austro, hungarian, ottoman, and, russian, empires, following, world, war, i, of, the, british, french, dutch, portuguese, belgian, italian, and, japanese, empires, following, world, war, ii, and, of, the, soviet, union, at, the, end, of, the, cold, war, early, studies, of, decolonisation, appeared, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, an, important, book, from, this, period, was, the, wretched, of, the, earth, 1961, by, martiniquan, author, frantz, fanon, which, established, many, aspects, of, decolonisation, that, would, be, considered, in, later, works, subsequent, studies, of, decolonisation, addressed, economic, disparities, as, a, legacy, of, colonialism, as, well, as, the, annihilation, of, people, s, cultures, ng, g, wa, thiong, o, explored, the, cultural, and, linguistic, legacies, of, colonialism, in, the, influential, book, decolonising, the, mind, 1986, decolonization, has, also, been, used, to, refer, to, the, intellectual, decolonization, from, the, colonizers, ideas, that, made, the, colonized, feel, inferior, issues, of, decolonization, persist, and, are, raised, contemporarily, in, the, americas, and, south, africa, such, issues, are, increasingly, discussed, under, the, term, decoloniality, in, the, two, hundred, years, following, the, american, revolutionary, war, in, 1783, 165, colonies, have, gained, independence, from, western, imperial, powers, several, analyses, point, to, different, reasons, for, the, spread, of, anti, colonial, political, movements, institutional, arguments, suggest, that, increasing, levels, of, education, in, the, colonies, led, to, calls, for, popular, sovereignty, marxist, analyses, view, decolonisation, as, a, result, of, economic, shifts, toward, wage, labor, and, an, enlarged, bourgeois, class, yet, another, argument, sees, decolonisation, as, a, diffusion, process, wherein, earlier, revolutionary, movements, inspired, later, ones, other, explanations, emphasize, how, the, lower, profitability, of, colonization, and, the, costs, associated, with, empire, prompted, decolonization, some, explanations, emphasize, how, colonial, powers, struggled, militarily, against, insurgents, in, the, colonies, due, to, a, shift, from, 19th, century, conditions, of, strong, political, will, a, permissive, international, environment, access, to, local, collaborators, and, flexibility, to, pick, their, battles, to, 20th, century, conditions, of, apathetic, publics, hostile, superpowers, vanishing, collaborators, and, constrained, options, in, other, words, colonial, powers, had, more, support, from, their, own, region, in, pursuing, colonies, in, the, 19th, century, than, they, did, in, the, 20th, century, where, holding, on, to, such, colonies, was, often, understood, to, be, a, burden, a, great, deal, of, scholarship, attributes, the, ideological, origins, of, national, independence, movements, to, the, age, of, enlightenment, enlightenment, social, and, political, theories, such, as, individualism, and, liberalism, were, central, to, the, debates, about, national, constitutions, for, newly, independent, countries, contemporary, decolonial, scholarship, has, critiqued, the, emancipatory, potential, of, enlightenment, thought, highlighting, its, erasure, of, indigenous, epistemologies, and, failure, to, provide, subaltern, and, indigenous, people, with, liberty, equality, and, dignity, great, britain, s, thirteen, north, american, colonies, were, the, first, to, declare, independence, forming, the, united, states, of, america, in, 1776, and, defeating, britain, in, the, revolutionary, war, the, haitian, revolution, was, a, revolt, in, 1789, and, subsequent, slave, uprising, in, 1791, in, the, french, colony, of, saint, domingue, on, the, caribbean, island, of, hispaniola, in, 1804, haiti, secured, independence, from, france, as, the, empire, of, haiti, which, later, became, a, republic, the, chaos, of, the, napoleonic, wars, in, europe, cut, the, direct, links, between, spain, and, its, american, colonies, allowing, for, the, process, of, decolonization, to, begin, with, the, invasion, of, spain, by, napoleon, in, 1806, the, american, colonies, declared, autonomy, and, loyalty, to, king, ferdinand, vii, the, contract, was, broken, and, each, of, the, regions, of, the, spanish, empire, had, to, decide, whether, to, show, allegiance, to, the, junta, of, cadiz, the, only, territory, in, spain, free, from, napoleon, or, have, a, junta, assembly, of, its, own, the, economic, monopoly, of, the, metropolis, was, the, main, reason, why, many, countries, decided, to, become, independent, from, spain, in, 1809, the, independence, wars, of, latin, america, began, with, a, revolt, in, la, paz, bolivia, in, 1807, and, 1808, the, viceroyalty, of, the, river, plate, was, invaded, by, the, british, after, their, 2nd, defeat, a, frenchman, called, santiague, de, liniers, was, proclaimed, a, new, viceroy, by, the, local, population, and, later, accepted, by, spain, in, may, 1810, in, buenos, aires, a, junta, was, created, but, in, montevideo, it, was, not, recognized, by, the, local, government, who, followed, the, authority, of, the, junta, of, cadiz, the, rivalry, between, the, two, cities, was, the, main, reason, for, the, distrust, between, them, during, the, next, 15, years, the, spanish, and, royalist, on, one, side, and, the, rebels, on, the, other, fought, in, south, america, and, mexico, numerous, countries, declared, their, independence, in, 1824, the, spanish, forces, were, defeated, in, the, battle, of, ayacucho, the, mainland, was, free, and, in, 1898, spain, lost, cuba, and, puerto, rico, in, the, spanish, american, war, puerto, rico, became, an, unincorporated, territory, of, the, us, but, cuba, became, independent, in, 1902, the, napoleonic, wars, also, led, to, the, severing, of, the, direct, links, between, portugal, and, its, only, american, colony, brazil, days, before, napoleon, invaded, portugal, in, 1807, the, portuguese, royal, court, fled, to, brazil, in, 1820, there, was, a, constitutionalist, revolution, in, portugal, which, led, to, the, return, of, the, portuguese, court, to, lisbon, this, led, to, distrust, between, the, portuguese, and, the, brazilian, colonists, and, finally, in, 1822, to, the, colony, becoming, independent, as, the, empire, of, brazil, which, later, became, a, republic, the, emergence, of, indigenous, political, parties, was, especially, characteristic, of, the, british, empire, which, seemed, less, ruthless, than, for, example, belgium, in, controlling, political, dissent, driven, by, pragmatic, demands, of, budgets, and, manpower, the, british, made, deals, with, the, local, politicians, across, the, empire, the, general, protocol, was, to, convene, a, constitutional, conference, in, london, to, discuss, the, transition, to, greater, self, government, and, then, independence, submit, a, report, of, the, constitutional, conference, to, parliament, if, approved, submit, a, bill, to, parliament, at, westminster, to, terminate, the, responsibility, of, the, united, kingdom, with, a, copy, of, the, new, constitution, annexed, and, finally, if, approved, issuance, of, an, order, of, council, fixing, the, exact, date, of, independence, after, world, war, i, several, former, german, and, ottoman, territories, in, the, middle, east, africa, and, the, pacific, were, governed, by, the, uk, as, league, of, nations, mandates, some, were, administered, directly, by, the, uk, and, others, by, british, dominions, nauru, and, the, territory, of, new, guinea, by, australia, south, west, africa, by, the, union, of, south, africa, and, western, samoa, by, new, zealand, egypt, became, independent, in, 1922, although, the, uk, retained, security, prerogatives, control, of, the, suez, canal, and, effective, control, of, the, anglo, egyptian, sudan, the, balfour, declaration, of, 1926, declared, the, british, empire, dominions, as, equals, and, the, 1931, statute, of, westminster, established, full, legislative, independence, for, them, the, equal, dominions, were, six, canada, newfoundland, australia, the, irish, free, state, new, zealand, and, the, union, of, south, africa, ireland, had, been, brought, into, a, union, with, great, britain, in, 1801, creating, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, until, the, formation, of, the, irish, free, state, in, 1922, however, some, of, the, dominions, were, already, independent, de, facto, and, even, de, jure, and, recognized, as, such, by, the, international, community, thus, canada, was, a, founding, member, of, the, league, of, nations, in, 1919, and, served, on, the, council, from, 1927, to, 1930, that, country, also, negotiated, on, its, own, and, signed, bilateral, and, multilateral, treaties, and, conventions, from, the, early, 1900s, onward, newfoundland, ceded, self, rule, back, to, london, in, 1934, iraq, a, league, of, nations, mandate, became, independent, in, 1932, in, response, to, a, growing, indian, independence, movement, the, uk, made, successive, reforms, to, the, british, raj, culminating, in, the, government, of, india, act, 1935, these, reforms, included, creating, elected, legislative, councils, in, some, of, the, provinces, of, british, india, mohandas, karamchand, gandhi, india, s, independence, movement, leader, led, a, peaceful, resistance, to, british, rule, by, becoming, a, symbol, of, both, peace, and, opposition, to, british, imperialism, many, indians, began, to, view, the, british, as, the, cause, of, india, s, problems, leading, to, a, newfound, sense, of, nationalism, among, its, population, with, this, new, wave, of, indian, nationalism, gandhi, was, eventually, able, to, garner, the, support, needed, to, push, back, the, british, and, create, an, independent, india, in, 1947, africa, was, only, fully, drawn, into, the, colonial, system, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, the, north, east, the, continued, independence, of, the, ethiopian, empire, remained, a, beacon, of, hope, to, pro, independence, activists, however, with, the, anti, colonial, wars, of, the, 1900s, decade, barely, over, new, modernizing, forms, of, africa, nationalism, began, to, gain, strength, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, the, emergence, of, pan, africanism, as, advocated, by, the, jamaican, journalist, marcus, garvey, 1887, 1940, whose, widely, distributed, newspapers, demanded, swift, abolition, of, european, imperialism, as, well, as, republicanism, in, egypt, kwame, nkrumah, 1909, 1972, who, was, inspired, by, the, works, of, garvey, led, ghana, to, independence, from, colonial, rule, independence, for, the, colonies, in, africa, began, with, the, independence, of, sudan, in, 1956, and, ghana, in, 1957, all, of, the, british, colonies, on, mainland, africa, became, independent, by, 1966, although, rhodesia, s, unilateral, declaration, of, independence, in, 1965, was, not, recognized, by, the, uk, or, internationally, some, of, the, british, colonies, in, asia, were, directly, administered, by, british, officials, while, others, were, ruled, by, local, monarchs, as, protectorates, or, in, subsidiary, alliance, with, the, uk, in, 1947, british, india, was, partitioned, into, the, independent, dominions, of, india, and, pakistan, hundreds, of, princely, states, states, ruled, by, monarchs, in, a, treaty, of, subsidiary, alliance, with, britain, were, integrated, into, india, and, pakistan, india, and, pakistan, fought, several, wars, over, the, former, princely, state, of, jammu, and, kashmir, french, india, was, integrated, into, india, between, 1950, and, 1954, and, india, annexed, portuguese, india, in, 1961, and, the, kingdom, of, sikkim, merged, with, india, by, popular, vote, in, 1975, significant, violence, was, involved, in, several, prominent, cases, of, decolonization, of, the, british, empire, partition, was, a, frequent, solution, in, 1783, the, north, american, colonies, were, divided, between, the, independent, united, states, and, british, north, america, which, later, became, canada, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, was, a, revolt, of, a, portion, of, the, indian, army, it, was, characterized, by, massacres, of, civilians, on, both, sides, it, was, not, a, movement, for, independence, however, and, only, a, small, part, of, india, was, involved, in, the, aftermath, the, british, pulled, back, from, modernizing, reforms, of, indian, society, and, the, level, of, organised, violence, under, the, british, raj, was, relatively, small, most, of, that, was, initiated, by, repressive, british, administrators, as, in, the, amritsar, massacre, of, 1919, or, the, police, assaults, on, the, salt, march, of, 1930, large, scale, communal, violence, broke, out, between, muslims, and, hindus, and, muslims, and, sikhs, after, the, british, left, in, 1947, in, the, newly, independent, dominions, of, india, and, pakistan, much, later, in, 1970, further, communal, violence, broke, out, within, pakistan, in, the, detached, eastern, part, of, east, bengal, which, became, independent, as, bangladesh, in, 1971, cyprus, which, came, under, full, british, control, in, 1914, from, the, ottoman, empire, was, culturally, divided, between, the, majority, greek, element, which, demanded, enosis, or, union, with, greece, and, the, minority, turks, london, for, decades, assumed, it, needed, the, island, to, defend, the, suez, canal, but, after, the, suez, crisis, of, 1956, that, became, a, minor, factor, and, greek, violence, became, a, more, serious, issue, cyprus, became, an, independent, country, in, 1960, but, ethnic, violence, escalated, until, 1974, when, turkey, invaded, and, partitioned, the, island, each, side, rewrote, its, own, history, blaming, the, other, palestine, became, a, british, mandate, from, the, league, of, nations, after, world, war, i, initially, including, transjordan, during, that, war, the, british, gained, support, from, jews, and, arabs, by, making, promises, to, both, see, balfour, declaration, and, mcmahon, hussein, correspondence, decades, of, ethno, religious, violence, reached, a, climax, with, the, un, partition, plan, and, the, ensuing, war, the, british, eventually, pulled, out, and, the, former, mandate, territory, was, divided, between, israel, jordan, and, egypt, after, world, war, i, the, colonized, people, were, frustrated, at, france, s, failure, to, recognize, the, effort, provided, by, the, french, colonies, resources, but, more, importantly, colonial, troops, the, famous, tirailleurs, although, in, paris, the, great, mosque, of, paris, was, constructed, as, recognition, of, these, efforts, the, french, state, had, no, intention, to, allow, self, rule, let, alone, grant, independence, to, the, colonized, people, thus, nationalism, in, the, colonies, became, stronger, in, between, the, two, wars, leading, to, abd, el, krim, s, rif, war, 1921, 1925, in, morocco, and, to, the, creation, of, messali, hadj, s, star, of, north, africa, in, algeria, in, 1925, however, these, movements, would, gain, full, potential, only, after, world, war, ii, after, world, war, i, france, administered, the, former, ottoman, territories, of, syria, and, lebanon, and, the, former, german, colonies, of, togoland, and, cameroon, as, league, of, nations, mandates, lebanon, declared, its, independence, in, 1943, and, syria, in, 1945, in, some, instances, decolonization, efforts, ran, counter, to, other, concerns, such, as, the, rapid, increase, of, antisemitism, in, algeria, in, the, course, of, the, nation, s, resistance, to, french, rule, although, france, was, ultimately, a, victor, of, world, war, ii, nazi, germany, s, occupation, of, france, and, its, north, african, colonies, during, the, war, had, disrupted, colonial, rule, on, 27, october, 1946, france, adopted, a, new, constitution, creating, the, fourth, republic, and, substituted, the, french, union, for, the, colonial, empire, however, power, over, the, colonies, remained, concentrated, in, france, and, the, power, of, local, assemblies, outside, france, was, extremely, limited, on, the, night, of, 29, march, 1947, a, madagascar, nationalist, uprising, led, the, french, government, headed, by, paul,
