the, proto, indo, europeans, are, a, hypothetical, prehistoric, ethnolinguistic, group, of, eurasia, who, spoke, proto, indo, european, pie, the, reconstructed, common, ancestor, of, the, indo, european, language, family, knowledge, of, them, comes, chiefly, from, that, linguistic, reconstruction, along, with, material, evidence, from, archaeology, and, archaeogenetics, the, proto, indo, europeans, likely, lived, during, the, late, neolithic, period, 6, 400, 3, 500, bc, mainstream, scholars, place, them, in, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, across, eurasia, this, steppe, extends, from, northeastern, bulgaria, and, southeastern, romania, through, moldova, and, southern, and, eastern, ukraine, through, the, northern, caucasus, of, southern, russia, and, into, the, lower, volga, region, of, western, kazakhstan, adjacent, to, the, kazakh, steppe, to, the, east, both, forming, part, of, the, larger, eurasian, steppe, some, archaeologists, would, extend, the, time, depth, of, pie, to, the, middle, neolithic, period, 5500, to, 4500, bc, or, even, the, early, neolithic, period, 7500, to, 5500, bc, and, suggest, alternative, origin, hypotheses, by, the, early, second, millennium, bc, descendants, of, the, proto, indo, europeans, had, reached, far, and, wide, across, eurasia, including, anatolia, hittites, the, aegean, the, linguistic, ancestors, of, mycenaean,

iranian, indo, aryan, iranian, others, european, in, the, words, of, philologist, martin, l, west, if, there, was, an, indo, european, language, it, follows, that, there, was, a, people, who, spoke, it, not, a, people, in, the, sense, of, a, nation, for, they, may, never, have, formed, a, political, unity, and, not, a, people, in, any, racial, sense, for, they, may, have, been, as, genetically, mixed, as, any, modern, population, defined, by, language, if, our, language, is, a, descendant, of, theirs, that, does, not, make, them, our, ancestors, any, more, than, the, ancient, romans, are, the, ancestors, of, the, french, the, romanians, and, the, brazilians, the, indo, europeans, were, a, people, in, the, sense, of, a, linguistic, community, we, should, probably, think, of, them, as, a, loose, network, of, clans, and, tribes, inhabiting, a, coherent, territory, of, limited, size, while, proto, indo, europeans, is, used, in, scholarship, to, designate, the, group, of, speakers, associated, with, the, reconstructed, proto, language, and, culture, the, term, indo, europeans, may, refer, to, any, historical, people, that, speak, an, indo, european, language, using, linguistic, reconstruction, from, old, indo, european, languages, such, as, latin, and, sanskrit, hypothetical, features, of, the, proto, indo, european, language, are, deduced, assuming, that, these, linguistic, features, reflect, culture, and, environment, of, the, proto, indo, europeans, the, following, cultural, and, environmental, traits, are, widely, proposed, a, 2016, phylogenetic, analysis, of, indo, european, folktales, posits, that, one, folktale, the, smith, and, the, devil, can, be, reconstructed, to, the, proto, indo, european, period, this, story, found, in, contemporary, indo, european, folktales, from, scandinavia, to, india, describes, a, blacksmith, who, offers, his, soul, to, a, malevolent, being, commonly, a, devil, in, modern, versions, of, the, tale, in, exchange, for, the, ability, to, weld, any, kind, of, materials, together, the, blacksmith, then, uses, his, new, ability, to, stick, the, devil, to, an, immovable, object, often, a, tree, thus, avoiding, his, end, of, the, bargain, according, to, the, authors, the, reconstruction, of, this, folktale, to, pie, implies, that, the, proto, indo, europeans, had, metallurgy, which, in, turn, suggests, a, plausible, context, for, the, cultural, evolution, of, a, tale, about, a, cunning, smith, who, attains, a, superhuman, level, of, mastery, over, his, craft, researchers, have, made, many, attempts, to, identify, particular, prehistoric, cultures, with, the, proto, indo, european, speaking, peoples, but, all, of, such, theories, remain, speculative, the, scholars, of, the, 1800s, who, first, tackled, the, question, of, the, indo, europeans, original, homeland, also, called, urheimat, from, german, had, essentially, only, linguistic, evidence, they, attempted, a, rough, localization, by, reconstructing, the, names, of, plants, and, animals, importantly, the, beech, and, the, salmon, as, well, as, the, culture, and, technology, a, bronze, age, culture, that, was, centered, upon, animal, husbandry, and, having, domesticated, the, horse, the, scholarly, opinions, became, basically, divided, between, a, european, hypothesis, which, positted, a, migration, from, europe, to, asia, and, an, asian, hypothesis, which, positted, that, the, migration, took, place, in, the, opposite, direction, in, the, early, 1900s, the, question, became, associated, with, the, expansion, of, a, supposed, aryan, race, a, now, discredited, theory, that, was, promoted, during, the, expansion, of, european, empires, and, the, rise, of, scientific, racism, the, question, remains, contentious, within, some, flavours, of, ethnic, nationalism, see, also, indigenous, aryans, a, series, of, major, advances, occurred, in, the, 1970s, due, to, the, convergence, of, several, factors, first, the, radiocarbon, dating, method, invented, in, 1949, had, become, sufficiently, inexpensive, to, be, applied, on, a, mass, scale, through, dendrochronology, tree, ring, dating, pre, historians, could, calibrate, radiocarbon, dates, to, a, much, higher, degree, of, accuracy, and, finally, before, the, 1970s, parts, of, eastern, europe, and, central, asia, had, been, off, limits, to, western, scholars, while, non, western, archaeologists, did, not, have, access, to, publication, in, western, peer, reviewed, journals, the, pioneering, work, of, marija, gimbutas, assisted, by, colin, renfrew, at, least, partly, addressed, this, problem, by, organizing, expeditions, and, arranging, for, more, academic, collaboration, between, western, and, non, western, scholars, the, kurgan, hypothesis, which, is, the, most, widely, held, theory, as, of, 2017, depends, upon, linguistic, and, archaeological, evidence, but, is, not, universally, accepted, it, posits, that, the, pies, originated, in, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, during, the, chalcolithic, age, a, minority, of, scholars, prefer, the, anatolian, hypothesis, which, posits, an, origin, in, anatolia, during, the, neolithic, age, other, theories, armenian, hypothesis, out, of, india, theory, paleolithic, continuity, theory, and, balkan, hypothesis, have, only, marginal, scholarly, support, in, regard, to, terminology, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, term, aryan, was, used, to, refer, to, the, proto, indo, europeans, and, their, descendants, however, aryan, more, properly, applies, to, the, indo, iranians, the, indo, european, branch, that, settled, parts, of, the, middle, east, and, south, asia, as, only, indic, and, iranian, languages, explicitly, affirm, the, term, as, a, self, designation, referring, to, the, entirety, of, their, people, whereas, the, same, proto, indo, european, root, aryo, is, the, basis, for, greek, and, germanic, word, forms, which, seem, only, to, denote, the, ruling, elite, of, proto, indo, european, pie, society, in, fact, the, most, accessible, evidence, available, confirms, only, the, existence, of, a, common, but, vague, socio, cultural, designation, of, nobility, associated, with, pie, society, such, that, greek, socio, cultural, lexicon, and, germanic, proper, names, derived, from, this, root, remain, insufficient, to, determine, whether, the, concept, was, limited, to, the, designation, of, an, exclusive, socio, political, elite, or, whether, it, could, possibly, have, been, applied, in, the, most, inclusive, sense, to, an, inherent, and, ancestral, noble, quality, which, allegedly, characterized, all, ethnic, members, of, pie, society, only, the, latter, could, have, served, as, a, true, and, universal, self, designation, for, the, proto, indo, european, people, by, the, early, 1900s, the, term, aryan, had, come, to, be, widely, used, in, a, racial, sense, in, which, it, referred, to, a, hypothesized, white, blond, and, blue, eyed, superior, race, the, dictator, adolf, hitler, called, this, race, the, master, race, herrenrasse, and, in, its, name, led, massive, pogroms, in, europe, subsequently, the, term, aryan, as, a, general, term, for, indo, europeans, has, been, largely, abandoned, by, scholars, though, the, term, indo, aryan, is, still, used, to, refer, to, the, branch, that, settled, in, southern, asia, according, to, some, archaeologists, pie, speakers, cannot, be, assumed, to, have, been, a, single, identifiable, people, or, tribe, but, were, a, group, of, loosely, related, populations, that, were, ancestral, to, the, later, still, partially, prehistoric, bronze, age, indo, europeans, this, is, believed, especially, by, those, archaeologists, who, posit, an, original, homeland, of, vast, extent, and, immense, time, depth, however, this, belief, is, not, shared, by, most, linguists, because, proto, languages, like, all, languages, before, modern, transport, and, communication, occupied, small, geographical, areas, over, a, limited, time, span, and, were, spoken, by, a, set, of, close, knit, communities, a, tribe, in, the, broad, sense, researchers, have, put, forward, a, great, variety, of, proposed, locations, for, the, first, speakers, of, proto, indo, european, few, of, these, hypotheses, have, survived, scrutiny, by, academic, specialists, in, indo, european, studies, sufficiently, well, to, be, included, in, modern, academic, debate, the, kurgan, or, steppe, hypothesis, was, first, formulated, by, otto, schrader, 1883, and, v, gordon, childe, 1926, and, was, later, systematized, by, marija, gimbutas, from, 1956, onwards, the, name, originates, from, the, kurgans, burial, mounds, of, the, eurasian, steppes, the, hypothesis, suggests, that, the, indo, europeans, a, patriarchal, patrilinear, and, nomadic, culture, of, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, which, is, now, part, northeastern, bulgaria, and, southeastern, romania, through, moldova, and, southern, and, eastern, ukraine, through, the, northern, caucasus, of, southern, russia, and, into, the, lower, volga, region, of, western, kazakhstan, expanded, into, the, area, through, several, waves, of, migration, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, coinciding, with, the, taming, of, the, horse, leaving, archaeological, signs, of, their, presence, see, corded, ware, culture, they, subjugated, the, supposedly, peaceful, egalitarian, and, matrilinear, european, neolithic, farmers, of, gimbutas, old, europe, a, modified, form, of, this, theory, by, j, p, mallory, which, dates, the, migrations, to, an, earlier, time, to, around, 3500, bce, and, puts, less, insistence, upon, their, violent, or, quasi, military, nature, remains, the, most, widely, accepted, theory, of, the, proto, indo, european, expansion, the, armenian, hypothesis, based, on, the, glottalic, theory, suggests, that, the, proto, indo, european, language, was, spoken, during, the, 4th, millennium, bc, in, the, armenian, highland, this, indo, hittite, model, does, not, include, the, anatolian, languages, in, its, scenario, the, phonological, peculiarities, of, pie, proposed, in, the, glottalic, theory, would, be, best, preserved, in, the, armenian, language, and, the, germanic, languages, the, former, assuming, the, role, of, the, dialect, which, remained, in, situ, implied, to, be, particularly, archaic, in, spite, of, its, late, attestation, proto, greek, would, be, practically, equivalent, to, mycenean, greek, and, would, date, to, the, 17th, century, bc, closely, associating, greek, migration, to, greece, with, the, indo, aryan, migration, to, india, at, about, the, same, time, viz, indo, european, expansion, at, the, transition, to, the, late, bronze, age, including, the, possibility, of, indo, european, kassites, the, armenian, hypothesis, argues, for, the, latest, possible, date, of, proto, indo, european, sans, anatolian, a, full, millennium, later, than, the, mainstream, kurgan, hypothesis, in, this, it, figures, as, an, opposite, to, the, anatolian, hypothesis, in, spite, of, the, geographical, proximity, of, the, respective, urheimaten, suggested, diverging, from, the, time, frame, suggested, there, by, a, full, three, millennia, the, anatolian, hypothesis, notably, advocated, by, colin, renfrew, from, the, 1980s, onwards, proposes, that, the, indo, european, languages, spread, peacefully, into, europe, from, anatolia, from, around, 7000, bc, with, the, neolithic, revolution, s, advance, of, farming, wave, of, advance, the, culture, of, the, indo, europeans, as, inferred, by, linguistic, reconstruction, raises, difficulties, for, this, theory, since, early, neolithic, cultures, lacked, the, horse, the, wheel, and, metal, terms, for, all, of, which, are, securely, reconstructed, for, proto, indo, european, renfrew, dismisses, this, argument, comparing, such, reconstructions, to, a, theory, that, the, presence, of, the, word, caf, in, all, modern, romance, languages, implies, that, the, ancient, romans, had, caf, s, too, another, argument, made, by, proponents, of, the, steppe, urheimat, such, as, david, anthony, against, renfrew, points, to, the, fact, that, ancient, anatolia, is, known, to, have, been, inhabited, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, by, non, indo, european, speaking, peoples, namely, the, hattians, perhaps, north, caucasian, speaking, the, chalybes, language, unknown, and, the, hurrians, hurro, urartian, following, the, publication, of, several, studies, on, ancient, dna, in, 2015, colin, renfrew, subsequently, acknowledged, the, important, role, of, migrations, of, populations, speaking, one, or, several, indo, european, languages, from, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, towards, northwestern, europe, noting, that, the, dna, evidence, from, ancient, skeletons, had, completely, rejuvenated, maria, gimbutas, kurgan, hypothesis, archaeogenetics, has, allowed, the, use, of, genetic, analysis, to, trace, migration, patterns, the, kurgan, hypothesis, or, steppe, theory, is, the, most, widely, accepted, proposal, to, identify, the, proto, indo, european, homeland, from, which, the, indo, european, languages, spread, out, throughout, europe, and, parts, of, asia, it, postulates, that, the, people, of, a, kurgan, culture, in, the, pontic, steppe, north, of, the, black, sea, were, the, most, likely, speakers, of, the, proto, indo, european, language, pie, the, term, is, derived, from, the, russian, kurgan, meaning, tumulus, or, burial, mound, according, to, three, autosomal, dna, studies, haplogroups, r1b, and, r1a, now, the, most, common, in, europe, r1a, is, also, very, common, in, south, asia, would, have, expanded, from, the, pontic, steppes, along, with, the, indo, european, languages, they, also, detected, an, autosomal, component, present, in, modern, europeans, which, was, not, present, in, neolithic, europeans, which, would, have, been, introduced, with, paternal, lineages, r1b, and, r1a, as, well, as, indo, european, languages, studies, which, analysed, ancient, human, remains, in, ireland, and, portugal, suggest, that, r1b, was, introduced, in, these, places, along, with, autosomal, dna, from, the, pontic, steppes, the, subclade, r1a1a, r, m17, or, r, m198, is, most, commonly, associated, with, indo, european, speakers, data, so, far, collected, indicate, that, there, are, two, widely, separated, areas, of, high, frequency, one, in, eastern, europe, around, poland, ukraine, and, russia, and, the, other, in, southern, asia, around, the, indo, gangetic, plain, which, is, part, of, india, pakistan, bangladesh, and, nepal, the, historical, and, prehistoric, possible, reasons, for, this, are, the, subject, of, on, going, discussion, and, attention, amongst, population, geneticists, and, genetic, genealogists, and, are, considered, to, be, of, potential, interest, to, linguists, and, archaeologists, also, a, large, 2014, study, by, underhill, et, al, using, 16, 244, individuals, from, over, 126, populations, from, across, eurasia, concluded, there, was, compelling, evidence, that, r1a, m420, originated, in, the, vicinity, of, iran, the, mutations, that, characterize, haplogroup, r1a, occurred, 10, 000, years, bp, its, defining, mutation, m17, occurred, about, 10, 000, to, 14, 000, years, ago, pamjav, et, al, 2012, believe, that, r1a, originated, and, initially, diversified, either, within, the, eurasian, steppes, or, the, middle, east, and, caucasus, region, ornella, semino, et, al, propose, a, postglacial, holocene, spread, of, the, r1a1, haplogroup, from, north, of, the, black, sea, during, the, time, of, the, late, glacial, maximum, which, was, subsequently, magnified, by, the, expansion, of, the, kurgan, culture, into, europe, and, eastward, according, to, jones, et, al, 2015, and, haak, et, al, 2015, autosomal, tests, indicate, that, the, yamnaya, people, were, the, result, of, admixture, between, eastern, hunter, gatherers, from, eastern, europe, ehg, and, caucasus, hunter, gatherers, chg, each, of, those, two, populations, contributed, about, half, the, yamnaya, dna, according, to, co, author, dr, andrea, manica, of, the, university, of, cambridge, the, question, of, where, the, yamnaya, come, from, has, been, something, of, a, mystery, up, to, now, we, can, now, answer, that, as, we, ve, found, that, their, genetic, make, up, is, a, mix, of, eastern, european, hunter, gatherers, and, a, population, from, this, pocket, of, caucasus, hunter, gatherers, who, weathered, much, of, the, last, ice, age, in, apparent, isolation, all, yamnaya, individuals, sampled, by, haak, et, al, 2015, belonged, to, the, y, haplogroup, r1b, based, on, these, findings, and, by, equating, the, people, of, the, yamnaya, culture, with, the, proto, indo, europeans, david, w, anthony, 2019, suggests, that, the, proto, indo, european, language, formed, mainly, from, a, base, of, languages, spoken, by, eastern, european, hunter, gathers, with, influences, from, languages, of, northern, caucasus, hunter, gatherers, in, addition, to, a, possible, later, influence, from, the, language, of, the, maikop, culture, to, the, south, which, is, hypothesized, to, have, belonged, to, the, north, caucasian, family, in, the, later, neolithic, or, bronze, age, involving, little, genetic, impact, according, to, haak, et, al, 2015, eastern, european, hunter, gatherers, who, inhabited, russia, were, a, distinctive, population, of, hunter, gatherers, with, high, affinity, to, a, 24, 000, year, old, siberian, from, the, mal, ta, buret, culture, or, other, closely, related, ancient, north, eurasian, ane, people, from, siberia, and, to, the, western, hunter, gatherers, whg, remains, of, the, eastern, european, hunter, gatherers, have, been, found, in, mesolithic, or, early, neolithic, sites, in, karelia, and, samara, oblast, russia, and, put, under, analysis, three, such, hunter, gathering, individuals, of, the, male, sex, have, had, their, dna, results, published, each, was, found, to, belong, to, a, different, y, dna, haplogroup, r1a, r1b, and, j, r1b, is, also, the, most, common, y, dna, haplogroup, found, among, both, the, yamnaya, and, modern, day, western, europeans, r1a, is, more, common, in, eastern, europeans, and, in, the, northern, parts, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, near, east, population, were, most, likely, hunter, gatherers, from, the, caucasus, chg, c, q, iran, chalcolithic, related, people, with, a, major, chg, component, jones, et, al, 2015, analyzed, genomes, from, males, from, western, georgia, in, the, caucasus, from, the, late, upper, palaeolithic, 13, 300, years, old, and, the, mesolithic, 9, 700, years, old, these, two, males, carried, y, dna, haplogroup, j, and, j2a, the, researchers, found, that, these, caucasus, hunters, were, probably, the, source, of, the, farmer, like, dna, in, the, yamnaya, as, the, caucasians, were, distantly, related, to, the, middle, eastern, people, who, introduced, farming, in, europe, their, genomes, showed, that, a, continued, mixture, of, the, caucasians, with, middle, eastern, took, place, up, to, 25, 000, years, ago, when, the, coldest, period, in, the, last, ice, age, started, according, to, lazaridis, et, al, 2016, a, population, related, to, the, people, of, the, iran, chalcolithic, contributed, 43, of, the, ancestry, of, early, bronze, age, populations, of, the, steppe, according, to, lazaridis, et, al, 2016, these, iranian, chalcolithic, people, were, a, mixture, of, the, neolithic, people, of, western, iran, the, levant, and, caucasus, hunter, gatherers, lazaridis, et, al, 2016, also, note, that, farming, spread, at, two, places, in, the, near, east, namely, the, levant, and, iran, from, where, it, spread, iranian, people, spreading, to, the, steppe, and, south, asia, haak, et, al, 2015, studied, dna, from, 94, skeletons, from, europe, and, russia, aged, between, 3, 000, and, 8, 000, years, old, they, concluded, that, about, 4, 500, years, ago, there, was, a, major, influx, into, europe, of, yamnaya, culture, people, originating, from, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, north, of, the, black, sea, and, that, the, dna, of, copper, age, europeans, matched, that, of, the, yamnaya, the, four, corded, ware, people, could, trace, an, astonishing, three, quarters, of, their, ancestry, to, the, yamnaya, according, to, the, paper, that, suggests, a, massive, migration, of, yamnaya, people, from, their, steppe, homeland, into, eastern, europe, about, 4500, years, ago, when, the, corded, ware, culture, began, perhaps, carrying, an, early, form, of, indo, european, language, a, 2017, archaeogenetics, study, of, mycenaean, and, minoan, remains, published, in, the, journal, nature, concluded, that, the, mycenaean, greeks, were, genetically, closely, related, with, the, minoans, but, unlike, the, minoans, also, had, a, 13, 18, genetic, contribution, from, bronze, age, steppe, populations, luigi, luca, cavalli, sforza, and, alberto, piazza, argue, that, renfrew, and, gimbutas, reinforce, rather, than, contradict, each, other, cavalli, sforza, 2000, states, that, it, is, clear, that, genetically, speaking, peoples, of, the, kurgan, steppe, descended, at, least, in, part, from, people, of, the, middle, eastern, neolithic, who, immigrated, there, from, turkey, piazza, cavalli, sforza, 2006, state, that, if, the, expansions, began, at, 9, 500, years, ago, from, anatolia, and, at, 6, 000, years, ago, from, the, yamnaya, culture, region, then, a, 3, 500, year, period, elapsed, during, their, migration, to, the, volga, don, region, from, anatolia, probably, through, the, balkans, there, a, completely, new, mostly, pastoral, culture, developed, under, the, stimulus, of, an, environment, unfavourable, to, standard, agriculture, but, offering, new, attractive, possibilities, our, hypothesis, is, therefore, that, indo, european, languages, derived, from, a, secondary, expansion, from, the, yamnaya, culture, region, after, the, neolithic, farmers, possibly, coming, from, anatolia, and, settled, there, developing, pastoral, nomadism, spencer, wells, suggests, in, a, 2001, study, that, the, origin, distribution, and, age, of, the, r1a1, haplotype, points, to, an, ancient, migration, possibly, corresponding, to, the, spread, by, the, kurgan, people, in, their, expansion, across, the, eurasian, steppe, around, 3000, bc, about, his, old, teacher, cavalli, sforza, s, proposal, wells, 2002, states, that, there, is, nothing, to, contradict, this, model, although, the, genetic, patterns, do, not, provide, clear, support, either, and, instead, argues, that, the, evidence, is, much, stronger, for, gimbutas, model, while, we, see, substantial, genetic, and, archaeological, evidence, for, an, indo, european, migration, originating, in, the, southern, russian, steppes, there, is, little, evidence, for, a, similarly, massive, indo, european, migration, from, the, middle, east, to, europe, one, possibility, is, that, as, a, much, earlier, migration, 8, 000, years, old, as, opposed, to, 4, 000, the, genetic, signals, carried, by, indo, european, speaking, farmers, may, simply, have, dispersed, over, the, years, there, is, clearly, some, genetic, evidence, for, migration, from, the, middle, east, as, cavalli, sforza, and, his, colleagues, showed, but, the, signal, is, not, strong, enough, for, us, to, trace, the, distribution, of, neolithic, languages, throughout, the, entirety, of, indo, european, speaking, europe, david, reich, 2018, noting, the, presence, of, some, indo, european, languages, such, as, hittite, in, parts, of, ancient, anatolia, argues, that, the, most, likely, location, of, the, population, that, first, spoke, an, indo, european, language, was, south, of, the, caucasus, mountains, perhaps, in, present, day, iran, or, armenia, because, ancient, dna, from, people, who, lived, there, matches, what, we, would, expect, for, a, source, population, both, for, the, yamnaya, and, for, ancient, anatolians, yet, reich, also, notes, that, the, evidence, here, is, circumstantial, as, no, ancient, dna, from, the, hittites, themselves, has, yet, been, published, kristian, kristiansen, in, an, interview, with, der, spiegel, in, may, 2018, stated, that, the, yamnaya, culture, may, have, had, a, predecessor, at, the, caucasus, where, proto, proto, indo, european, was, spoken, recent, dna, research, has, led, to, renewed, suggestions, of, a, caucasian, homeland, for, the, proto, indo, europeans, according, to, kroonen, et, al, 2018, and, damgaard, et, al, 2018, ancient, anatolia, show, no, indication, of, a, large, scale, intrusion, of, a, steppe, population, they, further, note, that, this, lends, support, to, the, indo, hittite, hypothesis, according, to, which, both, proto, anatolian, and, proto, indo, european, split, off, from, a, common, mother, language, no, later, than, the, 4th, millennium, bce, haak, et, al, 2015, states, that, the, armenian, plateau, hypothesis, gains, in, plausibility, since, the, yamnaya, partly, descended, from, a, near, eastern, population, which, resembles, present, day, armenians, wang, et, al, 2018, note, that, the, caucasus, served, as, a, corridor, for, gene, flow, between, the, steppe, and, cultures, south, of, the, caucasus, during, the, eneolithic, and, the, bronze, age, stating, that, this, opens, up, the, possibility, of, a, homeland, of, pie, south, of, the, caucasus, however, wang, et, al, also, comment, that, the, most, recent, genetic, evidence, supports, an, expansion, of, proto, indo, europeans, through, the, steppe, noting, but, the, latest, ancient, dna, results, from, south, asia, also, lend, weight, to, a, spread, of, indo, european, languages, via, the, steppe, belt, the, spread, of, some, or, all, of, the, proto, indo, european, branches, would, have, been, possible, via, the, north, caucasus, and, pontic, region, and, from, there, along, with, pastoralist, expansions, to, the, heart, of, europe, this, scenario, finds, support, from, the, well, attested, and, now, widely, documented, steppe, ancestry, in, european, populations, the, postulate, of, increasingly, patrilinear, societies, in, the, wake, of, these, expansions, exemplified, by, r1a, r1b, as, attested, in, the, latest, study, on, the, bell, beaker, phenomenon, david, w, anthony, in, a, 2019, analysis, criticizes, the, southern, or, armenian, hypothesis, addressing, reich, kristiansen, and, wang, among, his, reasons, being, that, the, yamnaya, lack, evidence, of, genetic, influence, from, the, bronze, age, or, late, neolithic, caucasus, deriving, instead, from, an, earlier, mixture, of, eastern, european, hunter, gatherers, and, caucasus, hunter, gatherers, and, have, paternal, lineages, that, seem, to, derive, from, the, hunter, gatherers, of, the, eastern, european, steppe, rather, than, the, caucasus, as, well, as, a, scarcity, in, the, yamnaya, of, the, anatolian, farmer, admixture, that, had, become, common, and, substantial, in, the, caucasus, around, 5, 000, bc, anthony, instead, suggests, a, genetic, and, linguistic, origin, of, proto, indo, europeans, the, yamnaya, in, the, eastern, european, steppe, north, of, the, caucasus, from, a, mixture, of, these, two, groups, ehg, and, chg, he, suggests, that, the, roots, of, proto, indo, european, archaic, or, proto, proto, indo, european, were, in, the, steppe, rather, than, the, south, and, that, pie, formed, mainly, from, a, base, of, languages, spoken, by, eastern, european, hunter, gathers, with, some, influences, from, languages, of, caucasus, hunter, gatherers
