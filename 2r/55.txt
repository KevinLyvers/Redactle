the, recorded, history, of, scotland, begins, with, the, arrival, of, the, roman, empire, in, the, 1st, century, when, the, province, of, britannia, reached, as, far, north, as, the, antonine, wall, north, of, this, was, caledonia, inhabited, by, the, picti, whose, uprisings, forced, rome, s, legions, back, to, hadrian, s, wall, as, rome, finally, withdrew, from, britain, a, gaelic, tribe, from, ireland, called, the, scoti, began, colonising, western, scotland, and, wales, before, roman, times, prehistoric, scotland, entered, the, neolithic, era, about, 4000, bc, the, bronze, age, about, 2000, bc, and, the, iron, age, around, 700, bc, the, gaelic, kingdom, of, d, l, riata, was, founded, on, the, west, coast, of, scotland, in, the, 6th, century, in, the, following, century, irish, missionaries, introduced, the, previously, pagan, picts, to, celtic, christianity, following, england, s, gregorian, mission, the, pictish, king, nechtan, chose, to, abolish, most, celtic, practices, in, favour, of, the, roman, rite, restricting, gaelic, influence, on, his, kingdom, and, avoiding, war, with, anglian, northumbria, towards, the, end, of, the, 8th, century, the, viking, invasions, began, forcing, the, picts, and, gaels, to, cease, their, historic, hostility, to, each, other, and, to, unite, in, the, 9th, century, forming, the, kingdom, of, scotland, the, kingdom, of, scotland, was, united, under, the, house, of, alpin, whose, members, fought, among, each, other, during, frequent, disputed, successions, the, last, alpin, king, malcolm, ii, died, without, a, male, issue, in, the, early, 11th, century, and, the, kingdom, passed, through, his, daughter, s, son, to, the, house, of, dunkeld, or, canmore, the, last, dunkeld, king, alexander, iii, died, in, 1286, he, left, only, his, infant, granddaughter, margaret, as, heir, who, died, herself, four, years, later, england, under, edward, i, would, take, advantage, of, this, questioned, succession, to, launch, a, series, of, conquests, resulting, in, the, wars, of, scottish, independence, as, scotland, passed, back, and, forth, between, the, house, of, balliol, and, the, house, of, bruce, through, the, late, middle, ages, scotland, s, ultimate, victory, confirmed, scotland, as, a, fully, independent, and, sovereign, kingdom, when, king, david, ii, died, in, 1371, without, issue, his, nephew, robert, ii, established, the, house, of, stuart, which, would, rule, scotland, uncontested, for, the, next, three, centuries, james, vi, stuart, king, of, scotland, also, inherited, the, throne, of, england, in, 1603, becoming, james, i, of, england, and, this, union, of, the, crowns, of, the, two, independent, kingdoms, lasted, until, the, acts, of, union, in, 1707, merged, the, two, kingdoms, into, a, new, state, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, ruling, until, 1714, queen, anne, was, the, last, stuart, monarch, since, 1714, the, succession, of, the, british, monarchs, of, the, houses, of, hanover, and, saxe, coburg, and, gotha, windsor, has, been, due, to, their, descent, from, james, vi, and, i, of, the, house, of, stuart, during, the, scottish, enlightenment, and, industrial, revolution, scotland, became, one, of, the, commercial, intellectual, and, industrial, powerhouses, of, europe, later, its, industrial, decline, following, the, second, world, war, was, particularly, acute, in, recent, decades, scotland, has, enjoyed, something, of, a, cultural, and, economic, renaissance, fuelled, in, part, by, the, proceeds, of, north, sea, oil, and, gas, since, the, 1950s, nationalism, has, become, a, strong, political, topic, with, serious, debates, on, scottish, independence, and, a, referendum, in, 2014, about, leaving, the, british, union, people, lived, in, scotland, for, at, least, 8, 500, years, before, britain, s, recorded, history, at, times, during, the, last, interglacial, period, 130, 000, 70, 000, bc, europe, had, a, climate, warmer, than, today, s, and, early, humans, may, have, made, their, way, to, scotland, with, the, possible, discovery, of, pre, ice, age, axes, on, orkney, and, mainland, scotland, glaciers, then, scoured, their, way, across, most, of, britain, and, only, after, the, ice, retreated, did, scotland, again, become, habitable, around, 9600, bc, upper, paleolithic, hunter, gatherer, encampments, formed, the, first, known, settlements, and, archaeologists, have, dated, an, encampment, near, biggar, to, around, 12000, bc, numerous, other, sites, found, around, scotland, build, up, a, picture, of, highly, mobile, boat, using, people, making, tools, from, bone, stone, and, antlers, the, oldest, house, for, which, there, is, evidence, in, britain, is, the, oval, structure, of, wooden, posts, found, at, south, queensferry, near, the, firth, of, forth, dating, from, the, mesolithic, period, about, 8240, bc, the, earliest, stone, structures, are, probably, the, three, hearths, found, at, jura, dated, to, about, 6000, bc, neolithic, farming, brought, permanent, settlements, evidence, of, these, includes, the, well, preserved, stone, house, at, knap, of, howar, on, papa, westray, dating, from, around, 3500, bc, and, the, village, of, similar, houses, at, skara, brae, on, west, mainland, orkney, from, about, 500, years, later, the, settlers, introduced, chambered, cairn, tombs, from, around, 3500, bc, as, at, maeshowe, and, from, about, 3000, bc, the, many, standing, stones, and, circles, such, as, those, at, stenness, on, the, mainland, of, orkney, which, date, from, about, 3100, bc, of, four, stones, the, tallest, of, which, is, 16, feet, 5, m, in, height, these, were, part, of, a, pattern, that, developed, in, many, regions, across, europe, at, about, the, same, time, the, creation, of, cairns, and, megalithic, monuments, continued, into, the, bronze, age, which, began, in, scotland, about, 2000, bc, as, elsewhere, in, europe, hill, forts, were, first, introduced, in, this, period, including, the, occupation, of, eildon, hill, near, melrose, in, the, scottish, borders, from, around, 1000, bc, which, accommodated, several, hundred, houses, on, a, fortified, hilltop, from, the, early, and, middle, bronze, age, there, is, evidence, of, cellular, round, houses, of, stone, as, at, jarlshof, and, sumburgh, in, shetland, there, is, also, evidence, of, the, occupation, of, crannogs, roundhouses, partially, or, entirely, built, on, artificial, islands, usually, in, lakes, rivers, and, estuarine, waters, in, the, early, iron, age, from, the, seventh, century, bc, cellular, houses, began, to, be, replaced, on, the, northern, isles, by, simple, atlantic, roundhouses, substantial, circular, buildings, with, a, dry, stone, construction, from, about, 400, bc, more, complex, atlantic, roundhouses, began, to, be, built, as, at, howe, orkney, and, crosskirk, caithness, the, most, massive, constructions, that, date, from, this, era, are, the, circular, broch, towers, probably, dating, from, about, 200, bc, this, period, also, saw, the, first, wheelhouses, a, roundhouse, with, a, characteristic, outer, wall, within, which, was, a, circle, of, stone, piers, bearing, a, resemblance, to, the, spokes, of, a, wheel, but, these, would, flourish, most, in, the, era, of, roman, occupation, there, is, evidence, for, about, 1, 000, iron, age, hill, forts, in, scotland, most, located, below, the, clyde, forth, line, which, have, suggested, to, some, archaeologists, the, emergence, of, a, society, of, petty, rulers, and, warrior, elites, recognisable, from, roman, accounts, of, the, surviving, pre, roman, accounts, of, scotland, the, first, written, reference, to, scotland, was, the, greek, pytheas, of, massalia, who, may, have, circumnavigated, the, british, isles, of, albion, britain, and, ierne, ireland, sometime, around, 325, bc, the, most, northerly, point, of, britain, was, called, orcas, orkney, 10, by, the, time, of, pliny, the, elder, who, died, in, ad, 79, roman, knowledge, of, the, geography, of, scotland, had, extended, to, the, hebudes, the, hebrides, dumna, probably, the, outer, hebrides, the, caledonian, forest, and, the, people, of, the, caledonii, from, whom, the, romans, named, the, region, north, of, their, control, caledonia, ptolemy, possibly, drawing, on, earlier, sources, of, information, as, well, as, more, contemporary, accounts, from, the, agricolan, invasion, identified, 18, tribes, in, scotland, in, his, geography, but, many, of, the, names, are, obscure, and, the, geography, becomes, less, reliable, in, the, north, and, west, suggesting, early, roman, knowledge, of, these, areas, was, confined, to, observations, from, the, sea, the, roman, invasion, of, britain, began, in, earnest, in, ad, 43, leading, to, the, establishment, of, the, roman, province, of, britannia, in, the, south, by, the, year, 71, the, roman, governor, quintus, petillius, cerialis, had, launched, an, invasion, of, what, is, now, scotland, in, the, year, 78, gnaeus, julius, agricola, arrived, in, britain, to, take, up, his, appointment, as, the, new, governor, and, began, a, series, of, major, incursions, he, is, said, to, have, pushed, his, armies, to, the, estuary, of, the, river, taus, usually, assumed, to, be, the, river, tay, and, established, forts, there, including, a, legionary, fortress, at, inchtuthil, after, his, victory, over, the, northern, tribes, at, mons, graupius, in, 84, a, series, of, forts, and, towers, were, established, along, the, gask, ridge, which, marked, the, boundary, between, the, lowland, and, highland, zones, probably, forming, the, first, roman, limes, or, frontier, in, scotland, agricola, s, successors, were, unable, or, unwilling, to, further, subdue, the, far, north, by, the, year, 87, the, occupation, was, limited, to, the, southern, uplands, and, by, the, end, of, the, first, century, the, northern, limit, of, roman, expansion, was, a, line, drawn, between, the, tyne, and, solway, firth, the, romans, eventually, withdrew, to, a, line, in, what, is, now, northern, england, building, the, fortification, known, as, hadrian, s, wall, from, coast, to, coast, around, 141, the, romans, undertook, a, reoccupation, of, southern, scotland, moving, up, to, construct, a, new, limes, between, the, firth, of, forth, and, the, firth, of, clyde, which, became, the, antonine, wall, the, largest, roman, construction, inside, scotland, it, is, a, sward, covered, wall, made, of, turf, around, 20, feet, 6, m, high, with, nineteen, forts, it, extended, for, 37, miles, 60, km, having, taken, twelve, years, to, build, the, wall, was, overrun, and, abandoned, soon, after, 160, the, romans, retreated, to, the, line, of, hadrian, s, wall, roman, troops, penetrated, far, into, the, north, of, modern, scotland, several, more, times, with, at, least, four, major, campaigns, the, most, notable, invasion, was, in, 209, when, the, emperor, septimius, severus, led, a, major, force, north, after, the, death, of, severus, in, 210, they, withdrew, south, to, hadrian, s, wall, which, would, be, roman, frontier, until, it, collapsed, in, the, 5th, century, the, great, conspiracy, constituted, a, seemingly, coordinated, invasion, against, roman, rule, in, britain, in, the, later, 4th, century, which, included, the, participation, of, the, gaelic, scoti, and, the, caledonians, who, were, then, known, as, picts, by, the, romans, this, was, defeated, by, the, comes, theodosius, however, roman, military, government, was, withdrawn, from, the, island, altogether, by, the, early, 5th, century, resulting, in, the, anglo, saxon, settlement, of, britain, and, the, immigration, of, the, saxons, to, southeastern, scotland, and, the, rest, of, eastern, great, britain, by, the, close, of, the, roman, occupation, of, southern, and, central, britain, in, the, 5th, century, the, picts, had, emerged, as, the, dominant, force, in, northern, scotland, with, the, various, brythonic, tribes, the, romans, had, first, encountered, there, occupying, the, southern, half, of, the, country, roman, influence, on, scottish, culture, and, history, was, not, enduring, in, the, centuries, after, the, departure, of, the, romans, from, britain, there, were, four, groups, within, the, borders, of, what, is, now, scotland, in, the, east, were, the, picts, with, kingdoms, between, the, river, forth, and, shetland, in, the, late, 6th, century, the, dominant, force, was, the, kingdom, of, fortriu, whose, lands, were, centred, on, strathearn, and, menteith, and, who, raided, along, the, eastern, coast, into, modern, england, in, the, west, were, the, gaelic, goidelic, speaking, people, of, d, l, riata, with, their, royal, fortress, at, dunadd, in, argyll, with, close, links, with, the, island, of, ireland, from, whom, comes, the, name, scots, in, the, south, was, the, british, brythonic, kingdom, of, strathclyde, descendants, of, the, peoples, of, the, roman, influenced, kingdoms, of, hen, ogledd, old, north, often, named, alt, clut, the, brythonic, name, for, their, capital, at, dumbarton, rock, finally, there, were, the, english, or, angles, germanic, invaders, who, had, overrun, much, of, southern, britain, and, held, the, kingdom, of, bernicia, in, the, south, east, the, first, english, king, in, the, historical, record, is, ida, who, is, said, to, have, obtained, the, throne, and, the, kingdom, about, 547, ida, s, grandson, thelfrith, united, his, kingdom, with, deira, to, the, south, to, form, northumbria, around, the, year, 604, there, were, changes, of, dynasty, and, the, kingdom, was, divided, but, it, was, re, united, under, thelfrith, s, son, oswald, r, 634, 642, scotland, was, largely, converted, to, christianity, by, irish, scots, missions, associated, with, figures, such, as, st, columba, from, the, fifth, to, the, seventh, centuries, these, missions, tended, to, found, monastic, institutions, and, collegiate, churches, that, served, large, areas, partly, as, a, result, of, these, factors, some, scholars, have, identified, a, distinctive, form, of, celtic, christianity, in, which, abbots, were, more, significant, than, bishops, attitudes, to, clerical, celibacy, were, more, relaxed, and, there, were, some, significant, differences, in, practice, with, roman, christianity, particularly, the, form, of, tonsure, and, the, method, of, calculating, easter, although, most, of, these, issues, had, been, resolved, by, the, mid, 7th, century, conversion, to, christianity, may, have, sped, a, long, term, process, of, gaelicisation, of, the, pictish, kingdoms, which, adopted, gaelic, language, and, customs, there, was, also, a, merger, of, the, gaelic, and, pictish, crowns, although, historians, debate, whether, it, was, a, pictish, takeover, of, d, l, riata, or, the, other, way, around, this, culminated, in, the, rise, of, c, naed, mac, ailp, n, kenneth, macalpin, in, the, 840s, which, brought, to, power, the, house, of, alpin, in, 867, ad, the, vikings, seized, the, southern, half, of, northumbria, forming, the, kingdom, of, york, three, years, later, they, stormed, the, britons, fortress, of, dumbarton, and, subsequently, conquered, much, of, england, except, for, a, reduced, kingdom, of, wessex, leaving, the, new, combined, pictish, and, gaelic, kingdom, almost, encircled, when, he, died, as, king, of, the, combined, kingdom, in, 900, domnall, ii, donald, ii, was, the, first, man, to, be, called, r, alban, i, e, king, of, alba, the, term, scotia, was, increasingly, used, to, describe, the, kingdom, between, north, of, the, forth, and, clyde, and, eventually, the, entire, area, controlled, by, its, kings, was, referred, to, as, scotland, the, long, reign, 900, 942, 3, of, causant, n, constantine, ii, is, often, regarded, as, the, key, to, formation, of, the, kingdom, of, alba, he, was, later, credited, with, bringing, scottish, christianity, into, conformity, with, the, catholic, church, after, fighting, many, battles, his, defeat, at, brunanburh, was, followed, by, his, retirement, as, a, culdee, monk, at, st, andrews, the, period, between, the, accession, of, his, successor, m, el, coluim, i, malcolm, i, and, m, el, coluim, mac, cin, eda, malcolm, ii, was, marked, by, good, relations, with, the, wessex, rulers, of, england, intense, internal, dynastic, disunity, and, relatively, successful, expansionary, policies, in, 945, m, el, coluim, i, annexed, strathclyde, as, part, of, a, deal, with, king, edmund, of, england, where, the, kings, of, alba, had, probably, exercised, some, authority, since, the, later, 9th, century, an, event, offset, somewhat, by, loss, of, control, in, moray, the, reign, of, king, donnchad, i, duncan, i, from, 1034, was, marred, by, failed, military, adventures, and, he, was, defeated, and, killed, by, macbeth, the, mormaer, of, moray, who, became, king, in, 1040, macbeth, ruled, for, seventeen, years, before, he, was, overthrown, by, m, el, coluim, the, son, of, donnchad, who, some, months, later, defeated, macbeth, s, step, son, and, successor, lulach, to, become, king, m, el, coluim, iii, malcolm, iii, it, was, m, el, coluim, iii, who, acquired, the, nickname, canmore, cenn, m, r, great, chief, which, he, passed, to, his, successors, and, who, did, most, to, create, the, dunkeld, dynasty, that, ruled, scotland, for, the, following, two, centuries, particularly, important, was, his, second, marriage, to, the, anglo, hungarian, princess, margaret, this, marriage, and, raids, on, northern, england, prompted, william, the, conqueror, to, invade, and, m, el, coluim, submitted, to, his, authority, opening, up, scotland, to, later, claims, of, sovereignty, by, english, kings, when, malcolm, died, in, 1093, his, brother, domnall, iii, donald, iii, succeeded, him, however, william, ii, of, england, backed, m, el, coluim, s, son, by, his, first, marriage, donnchad, as, a, pretender, to, the, throne, and, he, seized, power, his, murder, within, a, few, months, saw, domnall, restored, with, one, of, m, el, coluim, sons, by, his, second, marriage, edmund, as, his, heir, the, two, ruled, scotland, until, two, of, edmund, s, younger, brothers, returned, from, exile, in, england, again, with, english, military, backing, victorious, edgar, the, oldest, of, the, three, became, king, in, 1097, shortly, afterwards, edgar, and, the, king, of, norway, magnus, barefoot, concluded, a, treaty, recognising, norwegian, authority, over, the, western, isles, in, practice, norse, control, of, the, isles, was, loose, with, local, chiefs, enjoying, a, high, degree, of, independence, he, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, alexander, who, reigned, 1107, 1124, when, alexander, died, in, 1124, the, crown, passed, to, margaret, s, fourth, son, david, i, who, had, spent, part, of, his, life, in, england, where, he, held, a, barony, his, reign, saw, what, has, been, characterised, as, a, davidian, revolution, by, which, anglo, norman, followers, of, king, david, were, granted, lands, and, titles, and, intermixed, their, institutions, with, those, of, scots, intermarrying, with, the, existing, aristocracy, underpinning, the, development, of, later, medieval, scotland, david, s, anglo, norman, followers, joined, the, scottish, aristocracy, and, he, introduced, a, system, of, feudal, land, tenure, which, produced, knight, service, castles, and, an, available, body, of, heavily, armed, cavalry, he, created, a, style, of, court, closer, to, that, of, the, rest, of, western, europe, introduced, the, office, of, justicar, to, oversee, justice, and, local, offices, of, sheriffs, to, administer, localities, he, established, the, first, royal, burghs, in, scotland, granting, rights, to, particular, villages, and, towns, which, led, to, the, development, of, the, first, true, scottish, cities, and, helped, facilitate, economic, development, as, did, the, introduction, of, the, first, recorded, scottish, coinage, he, continued, a, process, begun, by, his, mother, and, brothers, helping, to, establish, foundations, that, brought, reform, to, scottish, monasticism, based, on, those, at, cluny, and, he, played, a, part, in, organising, diocese, on, lines, closer, to, those, in, the, rest, of, western, europe, these, reforms, were, pursued, under, his, successors, and, grandchildren, malcolm, iv, of, scotland, and, william, i, with, the, crown, now, passing, down, the, main, line, of, descent, through, primogeniture, leading, to, the, first, of, a, series, of, minorities, the, benefits, of, greater, authority, were, reaped, by, william, s, son, alexander, ii, and, his, son, alexander, iii, who, pursued, a, policy, of, peace, with, england, to, expand, their, authority, in, the, highlands, and, islands, by, the, reign, of, alexander, iii, the, scots, were, in, a, position, to, annexe, the, remainder, of, the, western, seaboard, which, they, did, following, haakon, haakonarson, s, ill, fated, invasion, and, the, stalemate, of, the, battle, of, largs, with, the, treaty, of, perth, in, 1266, the, death, of, king, alexander, iii, in, 1286, and, the, death, of, his, granddaughter, and, heir, margaret, maid, of, norway, in, 1290, left, 14, rivals, for, succession, to, prevent, civil, war, the, scottish, magnates, asked, edward, i, of, england, to, arbitrate, for, which, he, extracted, legal, recognition, that, the, realm, of, scotland, was, held, as, a, feudal, dependency, to, the, throne, of, england, before, choosing, john, balliol, the, man, with, the, strongest, claim, who, became, king, in, 1292, robert, bruce, 5th, lord, of, annandale, the, next, strongest, claimant, accepted, this, outcome, with, reluctance, over, the, next, few, years, edward, i, used, the, concessions, he, had, gained, to, systematically, undermine, both, the, authority, of, king, john, and, the, independence, of, scotland, in, 1295, john, on, the, urgings, of, his, chief, councillors, entered, into, an, alliance, with, france, known, as, the, auld, alliance, in, 1296, edward, invaded, scotland, deposing, king, john, the, following, year, william, wallace, and, andrew, de, moray, raised, forces, to, resist, the, occupation, and, under, their, joint, leadership, an, english, army, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, stirling, bridge, for, a, short, time, wallace, ruled, scotland, in, the, name, of, john, balliol, as, guardian, of, the, realm, edward, came, north, in, person, and, defeated, wallace, at, the, battle, of, falkirk, in, 1298, wallace, escaped, but, probably, resigned, as, guardian, of, scotland, in, 1305, he, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, english, who, executed, him, for, treason, despite, the, fact, that, he, owed, no, allegiance, to, england, rivals, john, comyn, and, robert, the, bruce, grandson, of, the, claimant, were, appointed, as, joint, guardians, in, his, place, on, 10, february, 1306, bruce, participated, in, the, murder, of, comyn, at, greyfriars, kirk, in, dumfries, less, than, seven, weeks, later, on, 25, march, bruce, was, crowned, as, king, however, edward, s, forces, overran, the, country, after, defeating, bruce, s, small, army, at, the, battle, of, methven, despite, the, excommunication, of, bruce, and, his, followers, by, pope, clement, v, his, support, slowly, strengthened, and, by, 1314, with, the, help, of, leading, nobles, such, as, sir, james, douglas, and, thomas, randolph, only, the, castles, at, bothwell, and, stirling, remained, under, english, control, edward, i, had, died, in, 1307, his, heir, edward, ii, moved, an, army, north, to, break, the, siege, of, stirling, castle, and, reassert, control, robert, defeated, that, army, at, the, battle, of, bannockburn, in, 1314, securing, de, facto, independence, in, 1320, the, declaration, of, arbroath, a, remonstrance, to, the, pope, from, the, nobles, of, scotland, helped, convince, pope, john, xxii, to, overturn, the, earlier, excommunication, and, nullify, the, various, acts, of, submission, by, scottish, kings, to, english, ones, so, that, scotland, s, sovereignty, could, be, recognised, by, the, major, european, dynasties, the, declaration, has, also, been, seen, as, one, of, the, most, important, documents, in, the, development, of, a,

signed, the, treaty, of, edinburgh, northampton, acknowledging, scottish, independence, under, the, rule, of, robert, the, bruce, however, four, years, after, robert, s, death, in, 1329, england, once, more, invaded, on, the, pretext, of, restoring, edward, balliol, son, of, john, balliol, to, the, scottish, throne, thus, starting, the, second, war, of, independence, despite, victories, at, dupplin, moor, and, halidon, hill, in, the, face, of, tough, scottish, resistance, led, by, sir, andrew, murray, the, son, of, wallace, s, comrade, in, arms, successive, attempts, to, secure, balliol, on, the, throne, failed, edward, iii, lost, interest, in, the, fate, of, his, prot, g, after, the, outbreak, of, the, hundred, years, war, with, france, in, 1341, david, ii, king, robert, s, son, and, heir, was, able, to, return, from, temporary, exile, in, france, balliol, finally, resigned, his, claim, to, the, throne, to, edward, in, 1356, before, retiring, to, yorkshire, where, he, died, in, 1364, after, david, ii, s, death, robert, ii, the, first, of, the, stewart, kings, came, to, the, throne, in, 1371, he, was, followed, in, 1390, by, his, ailing, son, john, who, took, the, regnal, name, robert, iii, during, robert, iii, s, reign, 1390, 1406, actual, power, rested, largely, in, the, hands, of, his, brother, robert, stewart, duke, of, albany, after, the, suspicious, death, possibly, on, the, orders, of, the, duke, of, albany, of, his, elder, son, david, duke, of, rothesay, in, 1402, robert, fearful, for, the, safety, of, his, younger, son, the, future, james, i, sent, him, to, france, in, 1406, however, the, english, captured, him, en, route, and, he, spent, the, next, 18, years, as, a, prisoner, held, for, ransom, as, a, result, after, the, death, of, robert, iii, regents, ruled, scotland, first, the, duke, of, albany, and, later, his, son, murdoch, when, scotland, finally, paid, the, ransom, in, 1424, james, aged, 32, returned, with, his, english, bride, determined, to, assert, his, authority, several, of, the, albany, family, were, executed, but, he, succeeded, in, centralising, control, in, the, hands, of, the, crown, at, the, cost, of, increasing, unpopularity, and, was, assassinated, in, 1437, his, son, james, ii, reigned, 1437, 1460, when, he, came, of, age, in, 1449, continued, his, father, s, policy, of, weakening, the, great, noble, families, most, notably, taking, on, the, powerful, black, douglas, family, that, had, come, to, prominence, at, the, time, of, the, bruce, in, 1468, the, last, significant, acquisition, of, scottish, territory, occurred, when, james, iii, was, engaged, to, margaret, of, denmark, receiving, the, orkney, islands, and, the, shetland, islands, in, payment, of, her, dowry, berwick, upon, tweed, was, captured, by, england, in, 1482, with, the, death, of, james, iii, in, 1488, at, the, battle, of, sauchieburn, his, successor, james, iv, successfully, ended, the, quasi, independent, rule, of, the, lord, of, the, isles, bringing, the, western, isles, under, effective, royal, control, for, the, first, time, in, 1503, he, married, margaret, tudor, daughter, of, henry, vii, of, england, thus, laying, the, foundation, for, the, 17th, century, union, of, the, crowns, scotland, advanced, markedly, in, educational, terms, during, the, 15th, century, with, the, founding, of, the, university, of, st, andrews, in, 1413, the, university, of, glasgow, in, 1450, and, the, university, of, aberdeen, in, 1495, and, with, the, passing, of, the, education, act, 1496, which, decreed, that, all, sons, of, barons, and, freeholders, of, substance, should, attend, grammar, schools, james, iv, s, reign, is, often, considered, to, have, seen, a, flowering, of, scottish, culture, under, the, influence, of, the, european, renaissance, in, 1512, the, auld, alliance, was, renewed, and, under, its, terms, when, the, french, were, attacked, by, the, english, under, henry, viii, james, iv, invaded, england, in, support, the, invasion, was, stopped, decisively, at, the, battle, of, flodden, field, during, which, the, king, many, of, his, nobles, and, a, large, number, of, ordinary, troops, were, killed, commemorated, by, the, song, flowers, of, the, forest, once, again, scotland, s, government, lay, in, the, hands, of, regents, in, the, name, of, the, infant, james, v, james, v, finally, managed, to, escape, from, the, custody, of, the, regents, in, 1528, he, continued, his, father, s, policy, of, subduing, the, rebellious, highlands, western, and, northern, isles, and, the, troublesome, borders, he, also, continued, the, french, alliance, marrying, first, the, french, noblewoman, madeleine, of, valois, and, then, after, her, death, marie, of, guise, james, v, s, domestic, and, foreign, policy, successes, were, overshadowed, by, another, disastrous, campaign, against, england, that, led, to, defeat, at, the, battle, of, solway, moss, 1542, james, died, a, short, time, later, a, demise, blamed, by, contemporaries, on, a, broken, heart, the, day, before, his, death, he, was, brought, news, of, the, birth, of, an, heir, a, daughter, who, would, become, mary, queen, of, scots, once, again, scotland, was, in, the, hands, of, a, regent, within, two, years, the, rough, wooing, began, henry, viii, s, military, attempt, to, force, a, marriage, between, mary, and, his, son, edward, this, took, the, form, of, border, skirmishing, and, several, english, campaigns, into, scotland, in, 1547, after, the, death, of, henry, viii, forces, under, the, english, regent, edward, seymour, 1st, duke, of, somerset, were, victorious, at, the, battle, of, pinkie, cleugh, the, climax, of, the, rough, wooing, and, followed, up, by, the, occupation, of, haddington, mary, was, then, sent, to, france, at, the, age, of, five, as, the, intended, bride, of, the, heir, to, the, french, throne, her, mother, marie, de, guise, stayed, in, scotland, to, look, after, the, interests, of, mary, and, of, france, although, the, earl, of, arran, acted, officially, as, regent, guise, responded, by, calling, on, french, troops, who, helped, stiffen, resistance, to, the, english, occupation, by, 1550, after, a, change, of, regent, in, england, the, english, withdrew, from, scotland, completely, from, 1554, on, marie, de, guise, took, over, the, regency, and, continued, to, advance, french, interests, in, scotland, french, cultural, influence, resulted, in, a, large, influx, of, french, vocabulary, into, scots, but, anti, french, sentiment, also, grew, particularly, among, protestants, who, saw, the, english, as, their, natural, allies, this, led, to, armed, conflict, at, the, siege, of, leith, marie, de, guise, died, in, june, 1560, and, soon, after, the, auld, alliance, also, ended, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, edinburgh, which, provided, for, the, removal, of, french, and, english, troops, from, scotland, the, scottish, reformation, took, place, only, days, later, when, the, scottish, parliament, abolished, the, roman, catholic, religion, and, outlawed, the, mass, meanwhile, queen, mary, had, been, raised, as, a, catholic, in, france, and, married, to, the, dauphin, who, became, king, as, francis, ii, in, 1559, making, her, queen, consort, of, france, when, francis, died, in, 1560, mary, now, 19, returned, to, scotland, to, take, up, the, government, despite, her, private, religion, she, did, not, attempt, to, re, impose, catholicism, on, her, largely, protestant, subjects, thus, angering, the, chief, catholic, nobles, her, six, year, personal, reign, was, marred, by, a, series, of, crises, largely, caused, by, the, intrigues, and, rivalries, of, the, leading, nobles, the, murder, of, her, secretary, david, riccio, was, followed, by, that, of, her, unpopular, second, husband, lord, darnley, and, her, abduction, by, and, marriage, to, the, earl, of, bothwell, who, was, implicated, in, darnley, s, murder, mary, and, bothwell, confronted, the, lords, at, carberry, hill, and, after, their, forces, melted, away, he, fled, and, she, was, captured, by, bothwell, s, rivals, mary, was, imprisoned, in, lochleven, castle, and, in, july, 1567, was, forced, to, abdicate, in, favour, of, her, infant, son, james, vi, mary, eventually, escaped, and, attempted, to, regain, the, throne, by, force, after, her, defeat, at, the, battle, of, langside, in, 1568, she, took, refuge, in, england, leaving, her, young, son, in, the, hands, of, regents, in, scotland, the, regents, fought, a, civil, war, on, behalf, of, james, vi, against, his, mother, s, supporters, in, england, mary, became, a, focal, point, for, catholic, conspirators, and, was, eventually, tried, for, treason, and, executed, on, the, orders, of, her, kinswoman, elizabeth, i, during, the, 16th, century, scotland, underwent, a, protestant, reformation, that, created, a, predominantly, calvinist, national, kirk, which, became, presbyterian, in, outlook, and, severely, reduced, the, powers, of, bishops, in, the, earlier, part, of, the, century, the, teachings, of, first, martin, luther, and, then, john, calvin, began, to, influence, scotland, particularly, through, scottish, scholars, often, training, for, the, priesthood, who, had, visited, continental, universities, the, lutheran, preacher, patrick, hamilton, was, executed, for, heresy, in, st, andrews, in, 1528, the, execution, of, others, especially, the, zwingli, influenced, george, wishart, who, was, burnt, at, the, stake, on, the, orders, of, cardinal, beaton, in, 1546, angered, protestants, wishart, s, supporters, assassinated, beaton, soon, after, and, seized, st, andrews, castle, which, they, held, for, a, year, before, they, were, defeated, with, the, help, of, french, forces, the, survivors, including, chaplain, john, knox, were, condemned, to, be, galley, slaves, in, france, stoking, resentment, of, the, french, and, creating, martyrs, for, the, protestant, cause, limited, toleration, and, the, influence, of, exiled, scots, and, protestants, in, other, countries, led, to, the, expansion, of, protestantism, with, a, group, of, lairds, declaring, themselves, lords, of, the, congregation, in, 1557, and, representing, their, interests, politically, the, collapse, of, the, french, alliance, and, english, intervention, in, 1560, meant, that, a, relatively, small, but, highly, influential, group, of, protestants, were, in, a, position, to, impose, reform, on, the, scottish, church, a, confession, of, faith, rejecting, papal, jurisdiction, and, the, mass, was, adopted, by, parliament, in, 1560, while, the, young, mary, queen, of, scots, was, still, in, france, knox, having, escaped, the, galleys, and, spent, time, in, geneva, as, a, follower, of, calvin, emerged, as, the, most, significant, figure, of, the, period, the, calvinism, of, the, reformers, led, by, knox, resulted, in, a, settlement, that, adopted, a, presbyterian, system, and, rejected, most, of, the, elaborate, trappings, of, the, medieval, church, the, reformed, kirk, gave, considerable, power, to, local, lairds, who, often, had, control, over, the, appointment, of, the, clergy, there, were, widespread, but, generally, orderly, outbreaks, of, iconoclasm, at, this, point, the, majority, of, the, population, was, probably, still, catholic, in, persuasion, and, the, kirk, found, it, difficult, to, penetrate, the, highlands, and, islands, but, began, a, gradual, process, of, conversion, and, consolidation, that, compared, with, reformations, elsewhere, was, conducted, with, relatively, little, persecution, women, shared, in, the, religiosity, of, the, day, the, egalitarian, and, emotional, aspects, of, calvinism, appealed, to, men, and, women, alike, historian, alasdair, raffe, finds, that, men, and, women, were, thought, equally, likely, to, be, among, the, elect, godly, men, valued, the, prayers, and, conversation, of, their, female, co, religionists, and, this, reciprocity, made, for, loving, marriages, and, close, friendships, between, men, and, women, furthermore, there, was, an, increasingly, intense, relationship, in, the, pious, bonds, between, minister, and, his, women, parishioners, for, the, first, time, laywomen, gained, numerous, new, religious, roles, and, took, a, prominent, place, in, prayer, societies, in, 1603, james, vi, king, of, scots, inherited, the, throne, of, the, kingdom, of, england, and, became, king, james, i, of, england, leaving, edinburgh, for, london, and, uniting, england, with, scotland, under, one, monarch, the, union, was, a, personal, or, dynastic, union, with, the, crowns, remaining, both, distinct, and, separate, despite, james, s, best, efforts, to, create, a, new, imperial, throne, of, great, britain, the, acquisition, of, the, irish, crown, along, with, the, english, facilitated, a, process, of, settlement, by, scots, in, what, was, historically, the, most, troublesome, area, of, the, kingdom, in, ulster, with, perhaps, 50, 000, scots, settling, in, the, province, by, the, mid, 17th, century, james, adopted, a, different, approach, to, impose, his, authority, in, the, western, highlands, and, islands, the, additional, military, resource, that, was, now, available, particularly, the, english, navy, resulted, in, the, enactment, of, the, statutes, of, iona, which, compelled, integration, of, hebridean, clan, leaders, with, the, rest, of, scottish, society, 37, 40, attempts, to, found, a, scottish, colony, in, north, america, in, nova, scotia, were, largely, unsuccessful, without, sufficient, funds, or, willing, colonists, although, james, had, tried, to, get, the, scottish, church, to, accept, some, of, the, high, church, anglicanism, of, his, southern, kingdom, he, met, with, limited, success, his, son, and, successor, charles, i, took, matters, further, introducing, an, english, style, prayer, book, into, the, scottish, church, in, 1637, this, resulted, in, anger, and, widespread, rioting, the, story, goes, that, it, was, initiated, by, a, certain, jenny, geddes, who, threw, a, stool, in, st, giles, cathedral, representatives, of, various, sections, of, scottish, society, drew, up, the, national, covenant, in, 1638, objecting, to, the, king, s, liturgical, innovations, in, november, of, the, same, year, matters, were, taken, even, further, when, at, a, meeting, of, the, general, assembly, in, glasgow, the, scottish, bishops, were, formally, expelled, from, the, church, which, was, then, established, on, a, full, presbyterian, basis, charles, gathered, a, military, force, but, as, neither, side, wished, to, push, the, matter, to, a, full, military, conflict, a, temporary, settlement, was, concluded, at, pacification, of, berwick, matters, remained, unresolved, until, 1640, when, in, a, renewal, of, hostilities, charles, s, northern, forces, were, defeated, by, the, scots, at, the, battle, of, newburn, to, the, west, of, newcastle, during, the, course, of, these, bishops, wars, charles, tried, to, raise, an, army, of, irish, catholics, but, was, forced, to, back, down, after, a, storm, of, protest, in, scotland, and, england, the, backlash, from, this, venture, provoked, a, rebellion, in, ireland, and, charles, was, forced, to, appeal, to, the, english, parliament, for, funds, parliament, s, demands, for, reform, in, england, eventually, resulted, in, the, english, civil, war, this, series, of, civil, wars, that, engulfed, england, ireland, and, scotland, in, the, 1640s, and, 1650s, is, known, to, modern, historians, as, the, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, the, covenanters, meanwhile, were, left, governing, scotland, where, they, raised, a, large, army, of, their, own, and, tried, to, impose, their, religious, settlement, on, episcopalians, and, roman, catholics, in, the, north, of, the, country, in, england, his, religious, policies, caused, similar, resentment, and, he, ruled, without, recourse, to, parliament, from, 1629, as, the, civil, wars, developed, the, english, parliamentarians, appealed, to, the, scots, covenanters, for, military, aid, against, the, king, a, solemn, league, and, covenant, was, entered, into, guaranteeing, the, scottish, church, settlement, and, promising, further, reform, in, england, scottish, troops, played, a, major, part, in, the, defeat, of, charles, i, notably, at, the, battle, of, marston, moor, an, army, under, the, earl, of, leven, occupied, the, north, of, england, for, some, time, however, not, all, scots, supported, the, covenanter, s, taking, arms, against, their, king, in, 1644, james, graham, 1st, marquess, of, montrose, attempted, to, raise, the, highlands, for, the, king, few, scots, would, follow, him, but, aided, by, 1, 000, irish, highland, and, islesmen, troops, sent, by, the, irish, confederates, under, alasdair, macdonald, maccolla, and, an, instinctive, genius, for, mobile, warfare, he, was, stunningly, successful, a, scottish, civil, war, began, in, september, 1644, with, his, victory, at, battle, of, tippermuir, after, a, series, of, victories, over, poorly, trained, covenanter, militias, the, lowlands, were, at, his, mercy, however, at, this, high, point, his, army, was, reduced, in, size, as, maccolla, and, the, highlanders, preferred, to, continue, the, war, in, the, north, against, the, campbells, shortly, after, what, was, left, of, his, force, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, philiphaugh, escaping, to, the, north, montrose, attempted, to, continue, the, struggle, with, fresh, troops, but, in, july, 1646, his, army, was, disbanded, after, the, king, surrendered, to, the, scots, army, at, newark, and, the, civil, war, came, to, an, end, the, following, year, charles, while, he, was, being, held, captive, in, carisbrooke, castle, entered, into, an, agreement, with, moderate, scots, presbyterians, in, this, secret, engagement, the, scots, promised, military, aid, in, return, for, the, king, s, agreement, to, implement, presbyterianism, in, england, on, a, three, year, trial, basis, the, duke, of, hamilton, led, an, invasion, of, england, to, free, the, king, but, he, was, defeated, by, oliver, cromwell, in, august, 1648, at, the, battle, of, preston, the, execution, of, charles, i, in, 1649, was, carried, out, in, the, face, of, objections, by, the, covenanter, government, and, his, son, was, immediately, proclaimed, as, king, charles, ii, in, edinburgh, oliver, cromwell, led, an, invasion, of, scotland, in, 1650, and, defeated, the, scottish, army, at, dunbar, one, year, later, a, scottish, invasion, of, england, was, again, defeated, by, cromwell, at, worcester, cromwell, emerged, as, the, leading, figure, in, the, english, government, and, scotland, was, occupied, by, an, english, force, under, george, monck, the, country, was, incorporated, into, the, puritan, governed, commonwealth, and, lost, its, independent, church, government, parliament, and, legal, system, but, gained, access, to, english, markets, various, attempts, were, made, to, legitimise, the, union, calling, representatives, from, the, scottish, burghs, and, shires, to, negotiations, and, to, various, english, parliaments, where, they, were, always, under, represented, and, had, little, opportunity, for, dissent, however, final, ratification, was, delayed, by, cromwell, s, problems, with, his, various, parliaments, and, the, union, did, not, become, the, subject, of, an, act, until, 1657, see, tender, of, union, following, the, death, of, cromwell, and, the, regime, s, collapse, charles, ii, was, restored, in, 1660, and, scotland, again, became, an, independent, kingdom, scotland, regained, its, system, of, law, parliament, and, kirk, but, also, the, lords, of, the, articles, by, which, the, crown, managed, parliament, bishops, and, a, king, who, did, not, visit, the, country, he, ruled, largely, without, reference, to, parliament, through, a, series, of, commissioners, these, began, with, john, earl, of, middleton, and, ended, with, the, king, s, brother, and, heir, james, duke, of, york, known, in, scotland, as, the, duke, of, albany, the, english, navigation, acts, prevented, the, scots, engaging, in, what, would, have, been, lucrative, trading, with, england, s, colonies, the, restoration, of, episcopacy, was, a, source, of, trouble, particularly, in, the, south, west, of, the, country, an, area, with, strong, presbyterian, sympathies, abandoning, the, official, church, many, of, the, inhabitants, began, to, attend, illegal, field, assemblies, known, as, conventicles, official, attempts, to, suppress, these, led, to, a, rising, in, 1679, defeated, by, james, duke, of, monmouth, the, king, s, illegitimate, son, at, the, battle, of, bothwell, bridge, in, the, early, 1680s, a, more, intense, phase, of, persecution, began, later, to, be, called, the, killing, time, when, charles, died, in, 1685, and, his, brother, a, roman, catholic, succeeded, him, as, james, vii, of, scotland, and, ii, of, england, matters, came, to, a, head, james, put, catholics, in, key, positions, in, the, government, and, attendance, at, conventicles, was, made, punishable, by, death, he, disregarded, parliament, purged, the, council, and, forced, through, religious, toleration, to, roman, catholics, alienating, his, protestant, subjects, it, was, believed, that, the, king, would, be, succeeded, by, his, daughter, mary, a, protestant, and, the, wife, of, william, of, orange, stadtholder, of, the, netherlands, but, when, in, 1688, james, produced, a, male, heir, james, francis, edward, stuart, it, was, clear, that, his, policies, would, outlive, him, an, invitation, by, seven, leading, englishmen, led, william, to, land, in, england, with, 40, 000, men, and, james, fled, leading, to, the, almost, bloodless, glorious, revolution, the, estates, issued, a, claim, of, right, that, suggested, that, james, had, forfeited, the, crown, by, his, actions, in, contrast, to, england, which, relied, on, the, legal, fiction, of, an, abdication, and, offered, it, to, william, and, mary, which, william, accepted, along, with, limitations, on, royal, power, the, final, settlement, restored, presbyterianism, and, abolished, the, bishops, who, had, generally, supported, james, however, william, who, was, more, tolerant, than, the, kirk, tended, to, be, passed, acts, restoring, the, episcopalian, clergy, excluded, after, the, revolution, although, william, s, supporters, dominated, the, government, there, remained, a, significant, following, for, james, particularly, in, the, highlands, his, cause, which, became, known, as, jacobitism, from, the, latin, jacobus, for, james, led, to, a, series, of, risings, an, initial, jacobite, military, attempt, was, led, by, john, graham, viscount, dundee, his, forces, almost, all, highlanders, defeated, william, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, killiecrankie, in, 1689, but, they, took, heavy, losses, and, dundee, was, slain, in, the, fighting, without, his, leadership, the, jacobite, army, was, soon, defeated, at, the, battle, of, dunkeld, in, the, aftermath, of, the, jacobite, defeat, on, 13, february, 1692, in, an, incident, since, known, as, the, massacre, of, glencoe, 38, members, of, the, clan, macdonald, of, glencoe, were, killed, by, members, of, the, earl, of, argyll, s, regiment, of, foot, on, the, grounds, that, they, had, not, been, prompt, in, pledging, allegiance, to, the, new, monarchs, the, closing, decade, of, the, 17th, century, saw, the, generally, favourable, economic, conditions, that, had, dominated, since, the, restoration, come, to, an, end, there, was, a, slump, in, trade, with, the, baltic, and, france, from, 1689, to, 1691, caused, by, french, protectionism, and, changes, in, the, scottish, cattle, trade, followed, by, four, years, of, failed, harvests, 1695, 1696, and, 1698, 1699, an, era, known, as, the, seven, ill, years, the, result, was, severe, famine, and, depopulation, particularly, in, the, north, the, parliament, of, scotland, of, 1695, enacted, proposals, to, help, the, desperate, economic, situation, including, setting, up, the, bank, of, scotland, the, company, of, scotland, trading, to, africa, and, the, indies, received, a, charter, to, raise, capital, through, public, subscription, with, the, dream, of, building, a, lucrative, overseas, colony, for, scotland, the, company, of, scotland, invested, in, the, darien, scheme, an, ambitious,

the, call, for, money, the, lower, classes, volunteered, as, colonists, but, the, english, government, opposed, the, idea, involved, in, the, war, of, the, grand, alliance, from, 1689, to, 1697,

lost, home, rule, the, union, allowed, it, to, break, free, of, a, stultifying, system, and, opened, the, way, for, the, scottish, enlightenment, as, well, as, a, great, expansion, of, trade, and, increase, in, opportunity, and, wealth, edinburgh, economist, adam, smith, concluded, in, 1776, that, by, the, union, with, england, the, middling, and, inferior, ranks, of, people, in, scotland, gained, a, complete, deliverance, from, the, power, of, an, aristocracy, which, had, always, before, oppressed, them, historian, jonathan, israel, holds, that, the, union, proved, a, decisive, catalyst, politically, and, economically, by, allowing, ambitious, scots, entry, on, an, equal, basis, to, a, rich, expanding, empire, and, its, increasing, trade, scotland, s, transformation, into, a, rich, leader, of, modern, industry, came, suddenly, and, unexpectedly, in, the, next, 150, years, following, its, union, with, england, in, 1707, and, its, integration, with, the, advanced, english, and, imperial, economies, the, transformation, was, led, by, two, cities, that, grew, rapidly, after, 1770, glasgow, on, the, river, clyde, was, the, base, for, the, tobacco, and, sugar, trade, with, an, emerging, textile, industry, edinburgh, was, the, administrative, and, intellectual, centre, where, the, scottish, enlightenment, was, chiefly, based, by, the, start, of, the, 18th, century, a, political, union, between, scotland, and, england, became, politically, and, economically, attractive, promising, to, open, up, the, much, larger, markets, of, england, as, well, as, those, of, the, growing, english, empire, with, economic, stagnation, since, the, late, 17th, century, which, was, particularly, acute, in, 1704, the, country, depended, more, and, more, heavily, on, sales, of, cattle, and, linen, to, england, who, used, this, to, create, pressure, for, a, union, the, scottish, parliament, voted, on, 6, january, 1707, by, 110, to, 69, to, adopt, the, treaty, of, union, it, was, also, a, full, economic, union, indeed, most, of, its, 25, articles, dealt, with, economic, arrangements, for, the, new, state, known, as, great, britain, it, added, 45, scots, to, the, 513, members, of, the, house, of, commons, and, 16, scots, to, the, 190, members, of, the, house, of, lords, and, ended, the, scottish, parliament, it, also, replaced, the, scottish, systems, of,

defeat, argyll, at, the, battle, of, sheriffmuir, at, this, point, james, belatedly, landed, in, scotland, but, was, advised, that, the, cause, was, hopeless, he, fled, back, to, france, an,

scotland, at, the, battle, of, prestonpans, the, jacobite, army, marched, into, england, took, carlisle, and, advanced, as, far, as, south, as, derby, however, it, became, increasingly, evident, that, england, would, not, support, a, roman, catholic, stuart, monarch, the, jacobite, leadership, had, a, crisis, of, confidence, and, they, retreated, to, scotland, as, two, english, armies, closed, in, and, hanoverian, troops, began, to, return, from, the, continent, charles, position, in, scotland, began, to, deteriorate, as, the, whig, supporters, rallied, and, regained, control, of, edinburgh, after, an, unsuccessful, attempt, on, stirling, he, retreated, north, towards, inverness, he, was, pursued, by, the, duke, of, cumberland, and, gave, battle, with, an, exhausted, army, at, culloden, on, 16, april, 1746, where, the, jacobite, cause, was, crushed, charles, hid, in, scotland, with, the, aid, of, highlanders, until, september, 1746, when, he, escaped, back, to, france, there, were, bloody, reprisals, against, his, supporters, and, foreign, powers, abandoned, the, jacobite, cause, with, the, court, in, exile, forced, to, leave, france, the, old, pretender, died, in, 1766, and, the, young, pretender, without, legitimate, issue, in, 1788, when, his, brother, henry, cardinal, of, york, died, in, 1807, the, jacobite, cause, was, at, an, end, with, the, advent, of, the, union, and, the, demise, of, jacobitism, access, to, london, and, the, empire, opened, up, very, attractive, career, opportunities, for, ambitious, middle, class, and, upper, class, scots, who, seized, the, chance, to, become, entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and, soldiers, thousands, of, scots, mainly, lowlanders, took, up, positions, of, power, in, politics, civil, service, the, army, and, navy, trade, economics, colonial, enterprises, and, other, areas, across, the, nascent, british, empire, historian, neil, davidson, notes, that, after, 1746, there, was, an, entirely, new, level, of, participation, by, scots, in, political, life, particularly, outside, scotland, davidson, also, states, that, far, from, being, peripheral, to, the, british, economy, scotland, or, more, precisely, the, lowlands, lay, at, its, core, british, officials, especially, appreciated, scottish, soldiers, as, the, secretary, of, war, told, parliament, in, 1751, i, am, for, having, always, in, our, army, as, many, scottish, soldiers, as, possible, because, they, are, generally, more, hardy, and, less, mutinous, the, national, policy, of, aggressively, recruiting, scots, for, senior, civilian, positions, stirred, up, resentment, among, englishmen, ranging, from, violent, diatribes, by, john, wilkes, to, vulgar, jokes, and, obscene, cartoons, in, the, popular, press, and, the, haughty, ridicule, by, intellectuals, such, as, samuel, johnson, that, was, much, resented, by, scots, in, his, great, dictionary, johnson, defined, oats, as, a, grain, which, in, england, is, generally, given, to, horses, but, in, scotland, supports, the, people, to, which, lord, elibank, retorted, very, true, and, where, will, you, find, such, men, and, such, horses, scottish, politics, in, the, late, 18th, century, was, dominated, by, the, whigs, with, the, benign, management, of, archibald, campbell, 3rd, duke, of, argyll, 1682, 1761, who, was, in, effect, the, viceroy, of, scotland, from, the, 1720s, until, his, death, in, 1761, scotland, generally, supported, the, king, with, enthusiasm, during, the, american, revolution, henry, dundas, 1742, 1811, dominated, political, affairs, in, the, latter, part, of, the, century, dundas, defeated, advocates, of, intellectual, and, social, change, through, his, ruthless, manipulation, of, patronage, in, alliance, with, prime, minister, william, pitt, the, younger, until, he, lost, power, in, 1806, the, main, unit, of, local, government, was, the, parish, and, since, it, was, also, part, of, the, church, the, elders, imposed, public, humiliation, for, what, the, locals, considered, immoral, behaviour, including, fornication, drunkenness, wife, beating, cursing, and, sabbath, breaking, the, main, focus, was, on, the, poor, and, the, landlords, lairds, and, gentry, and, their, servants, were, not, subject, to, the, parish, s, control, the, policing, system, weakened, after, 1800, and, disappeared, in, most, places, by, the, 1850s, the, clan, system, of, the, highlands, and, islands, had, been, seen, as, a, challenge, to, the, rulers, of, scotland, from, before, the, 17th, century, james, vi, s, various, measures, to, exert, control, included, the, statutes, of, iona, an, attempt, to, force, clan, leaders, to, become, integrated, into, the, rest, of, scottish, society, this, started, a, slow, process, of, change, which, by, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, saw, clan, chiefs, start, to, think, of, themselves, as, commercial, landlords, rather, than, as, patriarchs, of, their, people, to, their, tenants, initially, this, meant, that, monetary, rents, replaced, those, paid, in, kind, later, rent, increases, became, common, 11, 17, in, the, 1710s, the, dukes, of, argyll, started, putting, leases, of, some, of, their, land, up, for, auction, by, 1737, this, was, done, across, the, argyll, property, this, commercial, attitude, replaced, the, principle, of, d, thchas, which, included, the, obligation, on, clan, chiefs, to, provide, land, for, clan, members, the, shift, of, this, attitude, slowly, spread, through, the, highland, elite, but, not, among, their, tenants, 41, as, clan, chiefs, became, more, integrated, into, scottish, and, british, society, many, of, them, built, up, large, debts, it, became, easier, to, borrow, against, the, security, of, a, highland, estate, from, the, 1770s, onwards, as, the, lenders, became, predominantly, people, and, organisations, outside, the, highlands, there, was, a, greater, willingness, to, foreclose, if, the, borrower, defaulted, combined, with, an, astounding, level, of, financial, incompetence, among, the, highland, elite, this, ultimately, forced, the, sale, of, the, estates, of, many, highland, landed, families, over, the, period, 1770, 1850, the, greatest, number, of, sales, of, whole, estates, was, toward, the, end, of, this, period, 105, 107, 1, 17, 37, 46, 65, 73, 131, 132, the, jacobite, rebellion, of, 1745, gave, a, final, period, of, importance, to, the, ability, of, highland, clans, to, raise, bodies, of, fighting, men, at, short, notice, with, the, defeat, at, culloden, any, enthusiasm, for, continued, warfare, disappeared, and, clan, leaders, returned, to, their, transition, to, being, commercial, landlords, this, was, arguably, accelerated, by, some, of, the, punitive, laws, enacted, after, the, rebellion, these, included, the, heritable, jurisdictions, act, of, 1746, which, removed, judicial, roles, from, clan, chiefs, and, gave, them, to, the, scottish, law, courts, t, m, devine, warns, against, seeing, a, clear, cause, and, effect, relationship, between, the, post, culloden, legislation, and, the, collapse, of, clanship, he, questions, the, basic, effectiveness, of, the, measures, quoting, w, a, speck, who, ascribes, the, pacification, of, the, area, more, to, a, disinclination, to, rebel, than, to, the, government, s, repressive, measures, devine, points, out, that, social, change, in, gaeldom, did, not, pick, up, until, the, 1760s, and, 1770s, as, this, coincided, with, the, increased, market, pressures, from, the, industrialising, and, urbanising, lowlands, 30, 31, 41, properties, belonging, to, rebels, were, forfeited, to, the, crown, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 45, the, vast, majority, of, these, were, sold, by, auction, to, pay, creditors, 13, were, retained, and, managed, on, behalf, of, the, government, between, 1752, and, 1784, the, changes, by, the, dukes, of, argyll, in, the, 1730s, displaced, many, of, the, tacksmen, in, the, area, from, the, 1770s, onwards, this, became, a, matter, of, policy, throughout, the, highlands, the, restriction, on, subletting, by, tacksmen, meant, that, landlords, received, all, the, rent, paid, by, the, actual, farming, tenants, thereby, increasing, their, income, by, the, early, part, of, the, 19th, century, the, tacksman, had, become, a, rare, component, of, highland, society, t, m, devine, describes, the, displacement, of, this, class, as, one, of, the, clearest, demonstrations, of, the, death, of, the, old, gaelic, society, 34, many, emigrated, leading, parties, of, their, tenants, to, north, america, these, tenants, were, from, the, better, off, part, of, highland, peasant, society, and, together, with, the, tacksmen, they, took, their, capital, and, entrepreneurial, energy, to, the, new, world, unwilling, to, participate, in, economic, changes, imposed, by, their, landlords, which, often, involved, a, loss, of, status, for, the, tenant, 50, 173, agricultural, improvement, was, introduced, across, the, highlands, over, the, relatively, short, period, of, 1760, 1850, the, evictions, involved, in, this, became, known, as, the, highland, clearances, there, was, regional, variation, in, the, east, and, south, of, the, highlands, the, old, townships, or, bailtean, which, were, farmed, under, the, run, rig, system, were, replaced, by, larger, enclosed, farms, with, fewer, people, holding, leases, and, proportionately, more, of, the, population, working, as, employees, on, these, larger, farms, this, was, broadly, similar, to, the, situation, in, the, lowlands, in, the, north, and, west, including, the, hebrides, as, land, was, taken, out, of, run, rig, crofting, communities, were, established, much, of, this, change, involved, establishing, large, pastoral, sheep, farms, with, the, old, displaced, tenants, moving, to, new, crofts, in, coastal, areas, or, on, poor, quality, land, sheep, farming, was, increasingly, profitable, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, so, could, pay, substantially, higher, rents, than, the, previous, tenants, particularly, in, the, hebrides, some, crofting, communities, were, established, to, work, in, the, kelp, industry, others, were, engaged, in, fishing, croft, sizes, were, kept, small, so, that, the, occupiers, were, forced, to, seek, employment, to, supplement, what, they, could, grow, 32, 52, this, increased, the, number, of, seasonal, migrant, workers, travelling, to, the, lowlands, the, resulting, connection, with, the, lowlands, was, highly, influential, on, all, aspects, of, highland, life, touching, on, income, levels, social, attitudes, and, language, migrant, working, gave, an, advantage, in, speaking, english, which, came, to, be, considered, the, language, of, work, 135, 110, 117, in, 1846, the, highland, potato, famine, struck, the, crofting, communities, of, the, north, and, west, highlands, by, 1850, the, charitable, relief, effort, was, wound, up, despite, the, continuing, crop, failure, and, landlords, charities, and, the, government, resorted, to, encouraging, emigration, the, overall, result, was, that, almost, 11, 000, people, were, provided, with, assisted, passages, by, their, landlords, between, 1846, and, 1856, with, the, greatest, number, travelling, in, 1851, a, further, 5, 000, emigrated, to, australia, through, the, highland, and, island, emigration, society, to, this, should, be, added, an, unknown, but, significant, number, who, paid, their, own, fares, to, emigrate, and, a, further, unknown, number, assisted, by, the, colonial, land, and, emigration, commission, 201, 202, 207, 268, 320, 187, 189, this, was, out, of, a, famine, affected, population, of, about, 200, 000, people, many, of, those, who, remained, became, even, more, involved, in, temporary, migration, for, work, in, the, lowlands, both, out, of, necessity, during, the, famine, and, having, become, accustomed, to, working, away, by, the, time, the, famine, ceased, much, longer, periods, were, spent, out, of, the, highlands, often, for, much, of, the, year, or, more, one, illustration, of, this, migrant, working, was, the, estimated, 30, 000, men, and, women, from, the, far, west, of, the, gaelic, speaking, area, who, travelled, to, the, east, coast, fishing, ports, for, the, herring, fishing, season, providing, labour, in, an, industry, that, grew, by, 60, between, 1854, and, 1884, 335, 336, the, clearances, were, followed, by, a, period, of, even, greater, emigration, from, the, highlands, which, continued, with, a, brief, lull, for, the, first, world, war, up, to, the, start, of, the, great, depression, 2, historian, jonathan, israel, argues, that, by, 1750, scotland, s, major, cities, had, created, an, intellectual, infrastructure, of, mutually, supporting, institutions, such, as, universities, reading, societies, libraries, periodicals, museums, and, masonic, lodges, the, scottish, network, was, predominantly, liberal, calvinist, newtonian, and, design, oriented, in, character, which, played, a, major, role, in, the, further, development, of, the, transatlantic, enlightenment, in, france, voltaire, said, we, look, to, scotland, for, all, our, ideas, of, civilization, and, the, scots, in, turn, paid, close, attention, to, french, ideas, historian, bruce, lenman, says, their, central, achievement, was, a, new, capacity, to, recognize, and, interpret, social, patterns, the, first, major, philosopher, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, was, francis, hutcheson, who, held, the, chair, of, philosophy, at, the, university, of, glasgow, from, 1729, to, 1746, a, moral, philosopher, who, produced, alternatives, to, the, ideas, of, thomas, hobbes, one, of, his, major, contributions, to, world, thought, was, the, utilitarian, and, consequentialist, principle, that, virtue, is, that, which, provides, in, his, words, the, greatest, happiness, for, the, greatest, numbers, much, of, what, is, incorporated, in, the, scientific, method, the, nature, of, knowledge, evidence, experience, and, causation, and, some, modern, attitudes, towards, the, relationship, between, science, and, religion, were, developed, by, his, prot, g, s, david, hume, and, adam, smith, hume, became, a, major, figure, in, the, skeptical, philosophical, and, empiricist, traditions, of, philosophy, he, and, other, scottish, enlightenment, thinkers, developed, what, he, called, a, science, of, man, which, was, expressed, historically, in, works, by, authors, including, james, burnett, adam, ferguson, john, millar, and, william, robertson, all, of, whom, merged, a, scientific, study, of, how, humans, behave, in, ancient, and, primitive, cultures, with, a, strong, awareness, of, the, determining, forces, of, modernity, modern, sociology, largely, originated, from, this, movement, and, hume, s, philosophical, concepts, that, directly, influenced, james, madison, and, thus, the, united, states, constitution, and, when, popularised, by, dugald, stewart, would, be, the, basis, of, classical, liberalism, adam, smith, published, the, wealth, of, nations, often, considered, the, first, work, on, modern, economics, it, had, an, immediate, impact, on, british, economic, policy, and, in, the, 21st, century, still, framed, discussions, on, globalisation, and, tariffs, the, focus, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, ranged, from, intellectual, and, economic, matters, to, the, specifically, scientific, as, in, the, work, of, the, physician, and, chemist, william, cullen, the, agriculturalist, and, economist, james, anderson, chemist, and, physician, joseph, black, natural, historian, john, walker, and, james, hutton, the, first, modern, geologist, with, tariffs, with, england, now, abolished, the, potential, for, trade, for, scottish, merchants, was, considerable, however, scotland, in, 1750, was, still, a, poor, rural, agricultural, society, with, a, population, of, 1, 3, million, some, progress, was, visible, agriculture, in, the, lowlands, was, steadily, upgraded, after, 1700, and, standards, remained, high, there, were, the, sales, of, linen, and, cattle, to, england, the, cash, flows, from, military, service, and, the, tobacco, trade, that, was, dominated, by, glasgow, tobacco, lords, after, 1740, merchants, who, profited, from, the, american, trade, began, investing, in, leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and, soapworks, setting, the, foundations, for, the, city, s, emergence, as, a, leading, industrial, centre, after, 1815, the, tobacco, trade, collapsed, during, the, american, revolution, 1776, 1783, when, its, sources, were, cut, off, by, the, british, blockade, of, american, ports, however, trade, with, the, west, indies, began, to, make, up, for, the, loss, of, the, tobacco, business, reflecting, the, british, demand, for, sugar, and, the, demand, in, the, west, indies, for, herring, and, linen, goods, linen, was, scotland, s, premier, industry, in, the, 18th, century, and, formed, the, basis, for, the, later, cotton, jute, and, woollen, industries, scottish, industrial, policy, was, made, by, the, board, of, trustees, for, fisheries, and, manufactures, in, scotland, which, sought, to, build, an, economy, complementary, not, competitive, with, england, since, england, had, woollens, this, meant, linen, encouraged, and, subsidised, by, the, board, of, trustees, so, it, could, compete, with, german, products, merchant, entrepreneurs, became, dominant, in, all, stages, of, linen, manufacturing, and, built, up, the, market, share, of, scottish, linens, especially, in, the, american, colonial, market, the, british, linen, company, established, in, 1746, was, the, largest, firm, in, the, scottish, linen, industry, in, the, 18th, century, exporting, linen, to, england, and, america, as, a, joint, stock, company, it, had, the, right, to, raise, funds, through, the, issue, of, promissory, notes, or, bonds, with, its, bonds, functioning, as, bank, notes, the, company, gradually, moved, into, the, business, of, lending, and, discounting, to, other, linen, manufacturers, and, in, the, early, 1770s, banking, became, its, main, activity, it, joined, the, established, scottish, banks, such, as, the, bank, of, scotland, edinburgh, 1695, and, the, royal, bank, of, scotland, edinburgh, 1727, glasgow, would, soon, follow, and, scotland, had, a, flourishing, financial, system, by, the, end, of, the, century, there, were, over, 400, branches, amounting, to, one, office, per, 7, 000, people, double, the, level, in, england, where, banks, were, also, more, heavily, regulated, historians, have, emphasised, that, the, flexibility, and, dynamism, of, the, scottish, banking, system, contributed, significantly, to, the, rapid, development, of, the, economy, in, the, 19th, century, german, sociologist, max, weber, mentioned, scottish, presbyterianism, in, the, protestant, ethic, and, the,

the, moderate, cause, that, ultimately, prevailed, and, opened, the, way, for, liberal, thinking, in, the, cities, the, early, 18th, century, saw, the, beginnings, of, a, fragmentation, of, the, church, of, scotland, these, fractures, were, prompted, by, issues, of, government, and, patronage, but, reflected, a, wider, division, between, the, hard, line, evangelicals, and, the, theologically,

through, the, civil, wars, and, changes, of, regime, in, the, 17th, century, since, most, episcopalians, had, given, their, support, to, the, jacobite, rebellions, in, the, early, 18th, century, they, also, suffered, a, decline, in, fortunes, although, scotland, increasingly, adopted, the, english, language, and, wider, cultural, norms, its, literature, developed, a, distinct, national, identity, and, began, to, enjoy, an, international, reputation, allan, ramsay, 1686, 1758, laid, the, foundations, of, a, reawakening, of, interest, in, older, scottish, literature, as, well, as, leading, the,

have, found, poetry, written, by, ossian, he, published, translations, that, acquired, international, popularity, being, proclaimed, as, a, celtic, equivalent, of, the, classical, epics, fingal, written, in, 1762, was, speedily, translated, into, many, european, languages, and, its, deep, appreciation, of, natural, beauty, and, the, melancholy, tenderness, of, its, treatment, of, the, ancient, legend, did, more, than, any, single, work, to, bring, about, the, romantic, movement, in, european, and, especially, in, german, literature, influencing, herder, and, goethe, eventually, it, became, clear, that, the, poems, were, not, direct, translations, from, the, gaelic, but, flowery, adaptations, made, to, suit, the, aesthetic, expectations, of, his, audience, both, the, major,

the, scottish, parliament, in, 1696, reinforced, in, 1801, in, rural, communities, this, obliged, local, landowners, heritors, to, provide, a, schoolhouse, and, pay, a, schoolmaster, while, ministers,

effect, that, many, a, lad, of, pairts, had, been, able, to, rise, up, through, the, system, to, take, high, office, and, that, literacy, was, much, more, widespread, in, scotland, than, in,

than, the, english, and, other, contemporary, nations, a, few, talented, poor, boys, did, go, to, university, but, usually, they, were, helped, by, aristocratic, or, gentry, sponsors, most, of, them,

managed, to, gain, a, majority, of, the, westminster, parliamentary, seats, for, scotland, although, these, were, often, outnumbered, by, the, much, larger, number, of, english, and, welsh, conservatives, the, english, educated, scottish, peer, lord, aberdeen, 1784, 1860, led, a, coalition, government, from, 1852, to, 1855, but, in, general, very, few, scots, held, office, in, the,

to, pressure, by, reviving, the, post, of, secretary, of, state, for, scotland, which, had, been, in, abeyance, since, 1746, he, appointed, the, duke, of, richmond, a, wealthy, landowner, who, was,

help, projects, among, the, respectable, working, class, while, the, scottish, enlightenment, is, traditionally, considered, to, have, concluded, toward, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, disproportionately, large, scottish, contributions, to, british, science, and, letters, continued, for, another, 50, years, or, more, thanks, to, such, figures, as, the, mathematicians, and, physicists, james, clerk, maxwell, lord, kelvin, and, the, engineers, and, inventors, james, watt, and, william, murdoch, whose, work, was, critical, to, the, technological, developments, of, the, industrial, revolution, throughout, britain, in, literature, the, most, successful, figure, of, the, mid, nineteenth, century, was, walter, scott, who, began, as, a, poet, and, also, collected, and, published, scottish, ballads, his, first, prose, work, waverley, in, 1814, is, often, called, the, first, historical, novel, it, launched, a, highly, successful, career, that, probably, more, than, any, other, helped, define, and, popularise, scottish, cultural, identity, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, number, of, scottish, born, authors, achieved, international, reputations, robert, louis, stevenson, s, work, included, the, urban, gothic, novella, strange, case, of, dr, jekyll, and, mr, hyde, 1886, and, played, a, major, part, in, developing, the, historical, adventure, in, books, like, kidnapped, and, treasure, island, arthur, conan, doyle, s, sherlock, holmes, stories, helped, found, the, tradition, of, detective, fiction, the, kailyard, tradition, at, the, end, of, the, century, brought, elements, of, fantasy, and, folklore, back, into, fashion, as, can, be, seen, in, the, work, of, figures, like, j, m, barrie, most, famous, for, his, creation, of, peter, pan, and, george, macdonald, whose, works, including, phantasies, played, a, major, part, in, the, creation, of, the, fantasy, genre, scotland, also, played, a, major, part, in, the, development, of, art, and, architecture, the, glasgow, school, which, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, flourished, in, the, early, 20th, century, produced, a, distinctive, blend, of, influences, including, the, celtic, revival, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, and, japonisme, which, found, favour, throughout, the, modern, art, world, of, continental, europe, and, helped, define, the, art, nouveau, style, among, the, most, prominent, members, were, the, loose, collective, of, the, four, acclaimed, architect, charles, rennie, mackintosh, his, wife, the, painter, and, glass, artist, margaret, macdonald,

been, adopted, for, highland, regiments, in, the, british, army, which, poor, highlanders, joined, in, large, numbers, until, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1815, but, by, the, 19th, century, it, had, largely, been, abandoned, by, the, ordinary, people, in, the, 1820s, as, part, of, the, romantic, revival, tartan, and, the, kilt, were, adopted, by, members, of, the, social, elite, not, just, in, scotland, but, across, europe, prompted, by, the, popularity, of, macpherson, s, ossian, cycle, and, then, walter, scott, s, waverley, novels, the, world, paid, attention, to, their, literary, redefinition, of, scottishness, as, they, forged, an, image, largely, based, on, characteristics, in, polar, opposition, to, those, associated, with, england, and, modernity, this, new, identity, made, it, possible, for, scottish, culture, to, become, integrated, into, a, wider, european, and, north, american, context, not, to, mention, tourist, sites, but, it, also, locked, in, a, sense, of, otherness, which, scotland, began, to, shed, only, in, the, late, 20th, century, scott, s, staging, of, the, royal, visit, of, king, george, iv, to, scotland, in, 1822, and, the, king, s, wearing, of, tartan, resulted, in, a, massive, upsurge, in, demand, for, kilts, and, tartans, that, could, not, be, met, by, the, scottish, linen, industry, the, designation, of, individual, clan, tartans, was, largely, defined, in, this, period, and, became, a, major, symbol, of, scottish, identity, the, fashion, for, all, things, scottish, was, maintained, by, queen, victoria, who, helped, secure, the, identity, of, scotland, as, a, tourist, resort, with, balmoral, castle, in, aberdeenshire, becoming, a, major, royal, residence, from, 1852, despite, these, changes, the, highlands, remained, very, poor, and, traditional, with, few, connections, to, the, uplift, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, and, little, role, in, the, industrial, revolution, a, handful, of, powerful, families, typified, by, the, dukes, of, argyll, atholl, buccleuch, and, sutherland, owned, large, amounts, of, land, and, controlled, local, political, legal, and, economic, affairs, particularly, after, the, end, of, the, boom, created, by, the, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, 1790, 1815, these, landlords, needed, cash, to, maintain, their, position, in, london, society, and, had, less, need, of, soldiers, they, turned, to, money, rents, displaced, farmers, to, raise, sheep, and, downplayed, the, traditional, patriarchal, relationship, that, had, historically, sustained, the, clans, potato, blight, reached, the, highlands, in, 1846, where, 150, 000, people, faced, disaster, because, their, food, supply, was, largely, potatoes, with, a, little, herring, oatmeal, and, milk, they, were, rescued, by, an, effective, emergency, relief, system, that, stands, in, dramatic, contrast, to, the, failures, of, relief, in, ireland, as, the, famine, continued, landlords, charities, and, government, agencies, provided, assisted, passages, for, destitute, tenants, to, emigrate, to, canada, and, australia, in, excess, of, 16, 000, people, emigrated, with, most, travelling, in, 1851, 201, 207, 268, 187, 189, caused, by, the, advent, of, refrigeration, and, imports, of, lamb, mutton, and, wool, from, overseas, the, 1870s, brought, with, them, a, collapse, of, sheep, prices, and, an, abrupt, halt, in, the, previous, sheep, farming, boom, land, prices, subsequently, plummeted, too, and, accelerated, the, process, of, the, so, called, balmoralisation, of, scotland, an, era, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, that, saw, an, increase, in, tourism, and, the, establishment, of, large, estates, dedicated, to, field, sports, like, deer, stalking, and, grouse, shooting, especially, in, the, scottish, highlands, the, process, was, named, after, balmoral, estate, purchased, by, queen, victoria, in, 1848, that, fueled, the, romanticisation, of, upland, scotland, and, initiated, an, influx, of, the, newly, wealthy, acquiring, similar, estates, in, the, following, decades, by, the, late, 19th, century, just, 118, people, owned, half, of, scotland, with, nearly, 60, per, cent, of, the, whole, country, being, part, of, shooting, estates, while, their, relative, importance, has, somewhat, declined, due, to, changing, recreational, interests, throughout, the, 20th, century, deer, stalking, and, grouse, shooting, remain, of, prime, importance, on, many, private, estates, in, scotland, the, unequal, concentration, of, land, ownership, remained, an, emotional, subject, and, eventually, became, a, cornerstone, of, liberal, radicalism, the, politically, powerless, poor, crofters, embraced, the, popularly, oriented, fervently, evangelical, presbyterian, revival, after, 1800, and, the, breakaway, free, church, after, 1843, this, evangelical, movement, was, led, by, lay, preachers, who, themselves, came, from, the, lower, strata, and, whose, preaching, was, implicitly, critical, of, the, established, order, this, energised, the, crofters, and, separated, them, from, the, landlords, preparing, them, for, their, successful, and, violent, challenge, to, the, landlords, in, the, 1880s, through, the, highland, land, league, violence, began, on, the, isle, of, skye, when, highland, landlords, cleared, their, lands, for, sheep, and, deer, parks, it, was, quieted, when, the, government, stepped, in, passing, the, crofters, holdings, scotland, act, 1886, to, reduce, rents, guarantee, fixity, of, tenure, and, break, up, large, estates, to, provide, crofts, for, the, homeless, in, 1885, three, independent, crofter, candidates, were, elected, to, parliament, leading, to, explicit, security, for, the, scottish, smallholders, the, legal, right, to, bequeath, tenancies, to, descendants, and, creating, a, crofting, commission, the, crofters, as, a, political, movement, faded, away, by, 1892, and, the, liberal, party, gained, most, of, their, votes, the, population, of, scotland, grew, steadily, in, the, 19th, century, from, 1, 608, 000, in, the, census, of, 1801, to, 2, 889, 000, in, 1851, and, 4, 472, 000, in, 1901, even, with, the, development, of, industry, there, were, insufficient, good, jobs, as, a, result, during, the, period, 1841, 1931, about, 2, million, scots, emigrated, to, north, america, and, australia, and, another, 750, 000, scots, relocated, to, england, scotland, lost, a, much, higher, proportion, of, its, population, than, england, and, wales, reaching, perhaps, as, much, as, 30, 2, per, cent, of, its, natural, increase, from, the, 1850s, onwards, this, not, only, limited, scotland, s, population, increase, but, meant, that, almost, every, family, lost, members, due, to, emigration, and, because, more, of, them, were, young, males, it, skewed, the, sex, and, age, ratios, of, the, country, scots, born, emigrants, that, played, a, leading, role, in, the, foundation, and, development, of, the,

peter, fraser, and, outlaw, james, mckenzie, by, the, 21st, century, there, would, be, about, as, many, people, who, were, scottish, canadians, and, scottish, americans, as, the, 5, million, remaining, in, scotland, after, prolonged, years, of, struggle, in, 1834, the, evangelicals, gained, control, of, the, general, assembly, and, passed, the, veto, act, which, allowed, congregations, to, reject, unwanted, intrusive, presentations, to, livings, by, patrons, the, following, ten, years, conflict, of, legal, and, political, wrangling, ended, in, defeat, for, the, non, intrusionists, in, the, civil, courts, the, result, was, a, schism, from, the, church, by, some, of, the, non, intrusionists, led, by, dr, thomas, chalmers, known, as, the, great, disruption, of, 1843, roughly, a, third, of, the, clergy, mainly, from, the, north, and, highlands, formed, the, separate, free, church, of, scotland, the, evangelical, free, churches, which, were, more, accepting, of, gaelic, language, and, culture, grew, rapidly, in, the, highlands, and, islands, appealing, much, more, strongly, than, did, the, established, church, chalmers, s, ideas, shaped, the, breakaway, group, he, stressed, a, social, vision, that, revived, and, preserved, scotland, s, communal, traditions, at, a, time, of, strain, on, the, social, fabric, of, the, country, chalmers, s, idealised, small, equalitarian, kirk, based, self, contained, communities, that, recognised, the, individuality, of, their, members, and, the, need, for, co, operation, that, vision, also, affected, the, mainstream, presbyterian, churches, and, by, the, 1870s, it, had, been, assimilated, by, the, established, church, of, scotland, chalmers, s, ideals, demonstrated, that, the, church, was, concerned, with, the, problems, of, urban, society, and, they, represented, a, real, attempt, to, overcome, the, social, fragmentation, that, took, place, in, industrial, towns, and, cities, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, major, debates, were, between, fundamentalist, calvinists, and, theological, liberals, who, rejected, a, literal, interpretation, of, the, bible, this, resulted, in, a, further, split, in, the, free, church, as, the, rigid, calvinists, broke, away, to, form, the, free, presbyterian, church, in, 1893, there, were, however, also, moves, towards, reunion, beginning, with, the, unification, of, some, secessionist, churches, into, the, united, secession, church, in, 1820, which, united, with, the, relief, church, in, 1847, to, form, the, united, presbyterian, church, which, in, turn, joined, with, the, free, church, in, 1900, to, form, the, united, free, church, of, scotland, the, removal, of, legislation, on, lay, patronage, would, allow, the, majority, of, the, free, church, to, rejoin, church, of, scotland, in, 1929, the, schisms, left, small, denominations, including, the, free, presbyterians, and, a, remnant, that, had, not, merged, in, 1900, as, the, free, church, catholic, emancipation, in, 1829, and, the, influx, of, large, numbers, of, irish, immigrants, particularly, after, the, famine, years, of, the, late, 1840s, principally, to, the, growing, lowland, centres, like, glasgow, led, to, a, transformation, in, the, fortunes, of, catholicism, in, 1878, despite, opposition, a, roman, catholic, ecclesiastical, hierarchy, was, restored, to, the, country, and, catholicism, became, a, significant, denomination, within, scotland, episcopalianism, also, revived, in, the, 19th, century, as, the, issue, of, succession, receded, becoming, established, as, the, episcopal, church, in, scotland, in, 1804, as, an, autonomous, organisation, in, communion, with, the, church, of, england, baptist, congregationalist, and, methodist, churches, had, appeared, in, scotland, in, the, 18th, century, but, did, not, begin, significant, growth, until, the, 19th, century, partly, because, more, radical, and, evangelical, traditions, already, existed, within, the, church, of, scotland, and, the, free, churches, from, 1879, they, were, joined, by, the, evangelical, revivalism, of, the, salvation, army, which, attempted, to, make, major, inroads, in, the, growing, urban, centres, industrialisation, urbanisation, and, the, disruption, of, 1843, all, undermined, the, tradition, of, parish, schools, from, 1830, the, state, began, to, fund, buildings, with, grants, then, from, 1846, it, was, funding, schools, by, direct, sponsorship, and, in, 1872, scotland, moved, to, a, system, like, that, in, england, of, state, sponsored, largely, free, schools, run, by, local, school, boards, overall, administration, was, in, the, hands, of, the, scotch, later, scottish, education, department, in, london, education, was, now, compulsory, from, five, to, thirteen, and, many, new, board, schools, were, built, larger, urban, school, boards, established, higher, grade, secondary, schools, as, a, cheaper, alternative, to, the, burgh, schools, the, scottish, education, department, introduced, a, leaving, certificate, examination, in, 1888, to, set, national, standards, for, secondary, education, and, in, 1890, school, fees, were, abolished, creating, a, state, funded, national, system, of, free, basic, education, and, common, examinations, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, scottish, universities, had, no, entrance, exam, students, typically, entered, at, ages, of, 15, or, 16, attended, for, as, little, as, two, years, chose, which, lectures, to, attend, and, could, leave, without, qualifications, after, two, commissions, of, enquiry, in, 1826, and, 1876, and, reforming, acts, of, parliament, in, 1858, and, 1889, the, curriculum, and, system, of, graduation, were, reformed, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, emerging, middle, classes, and, the, professions, entrance, examinations, equivalent, to, the, school, leaving, certificate, were, introduced, and, average, ages, of, entry, rose, to, 17, or, 18, standard, patterns, of, graduation, in, the, arts, curriculum, offered, 3, year, ordinary, and, 4, year, honours, degrees, and, separate, science, faculties, were, able, to, move, away, from, the, compulsory, latin, greek, and, philosophy, of, the, old, ma, curriculum, the, historic, university, of, glasgow, became, a, leader, in, british, higher, education, by, providing, the, educational, needs, of, youth, from, the, urban, and, commercial, classes, as, well, as, the, upper, class, it, prepared, students, for, non, commercial, careers, in, government, the, law, medicine, education, and, the, ministry, and, a, smaller, group, for, careers, in, science, and, engineering, st, andrews, pioneered, the, admission, of, women, to, scottish, universities, creating, the, lady, licentiate, in, arts, lla, which, proved, highly, popular, from, 1892, scottish, universities, could, admit, and, graduate, women, and, the, numbers, of, women, at, scottish, universities, steadily, increased,

rest, of, europe, s, fishing, fleets, were, slower, because, they, were, still, powered, by, sails, in, the, khaki, election, of, 1900, nationalist, concern, with, the, boer, war, meant, that, the, conservatives, and, their, liberal, unionist, allies, gained, a, majority, of, scottish, seats, for, the, first, time, although, the, liberals, regained, their, ascendancy, in, the, next, election, the, unionists, and, conservatives, merged, in, 1912, usually, known, as, the, conservatives, in, england, and, wales, they, adopted, the, name, unionist, party, in, scotland, scots, played, a, major, part, in, the, leadership, of, uk, political, parties, producing, a, conservative, prime, minister, in, arthur, balfour, 1902, 1905, and, a, liberal, one, in, henry, campbell, bannerman, 1905, 1908, various, organisations, including, the, independent, labour, party, joined, to, make, the, british, labour, party, in, 1906, with, keir, hardie, as, its, first, chairman, scotland, played, a, major, role, in, the, british, effort, in, the, first, world, war, it, especially, provided, manpower, ships, machinery, food, particularly, fish, and, money, engaging, with, the, conflict, with, some, enthusiasm, scotland, s, industries, were, directed, at, the, war, effort, for, example, the, singer, clydebank, sewing, machine, factory, received, over, 5000, government, contracts, and, made, 303,

proportions, of, the, active, combatants, and, suffered, corresponding, loses, as, at, the, battle, of, loos, where, there, were, three, full, scots, divisions, and, other, scottish, units, thus, although, scots, were, only, 10, per, cent, of, the, british, population, they, made, up, 15, per, cent, of, the, national, armed, forces, and, eventually, accounted, for, 20, per, cent, of, the, dead, some, areas, like, the, thinly, populated, island, of, lewis, and, harris, suffered, some, of, the, highest, proportional, losses, of, any, part, of, britain, clydeside, shipyards, and, the,

were, especially, hard, hit, because, there, were, few, alternative, uses, for, their, specialised, skills, the, main, social, indicators, such, as, poor, health, bad, housing, and, long, term, mass, unemployment, pointed, to, terminal, social, and, economic, stagnation, at, best, or, even, a, downward, spiral, the, heavy, dependence, on, obsolescent, heavy, industry, and, mining, was, a, central, problem, and, no, one, offered, workable, solutions, the, despair, reflected, what, finlay, 1994, describes, as, a, widespread, sense, of, hopelessness, that, prepared, local, business, and, political, leaders, to, accept, a, new, orthodoxy, of, centralised, government, economic, planning, when, it, arrived, during, the, second, world, war, a, few, industries, did, grow, such, as,

agitation, among, industrial, workers, following, world, war, i, the, liberal, party, began, to, disintegrate, and, labour, emerged, as, the, party, of, progressive, politics, in, scotland, gaining,

single, school, they, all, pursued, an, exploration, of, identity, rejecting, nostalgia, and, parochialism, and, engaging, with, social, and, political, issues, in, the, 20th, century, the, centre, of, the, education, system, became, more, focused, on, scotland, with, the, ministry, of, education, partly, moving, north, in, 1918, and, then, finally, having, its, headquarters, relocated, to, edinburgh, in, 1939, the, school, leaving, age, was, raised, to, 14, in, 1901, but, despite, attempts, to, raise, it, to, 15, this, was, only, made, law, in, 1939, and, then, postponed, because, of, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1918, roman, catholic, schools, were, brought, into, the, state, system, but, retained, their, distinct, religious, character, access, to, schools, by, priests, and, the, requirement, that, school, staff, be, acceptable, to, the, church, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, saw, scottish, universities, fall, behind, those, in, england, and, europe, in, terms, of, participation, and, investment, the, decline, of, traditional, industries, between, the, wars, undermined, recruitment, english, universities, increased, the, numbers, of, students, registered, between, 1924, and, 1927, by, 19, per, cent, but, in, scotland, the, numbers, fell, particularly, among, women, in, the, same, period, while, expenditure, in, english, universities, rose, by, 90, per, cent, in, scotland, the, increase, was, less, than, a, third, of, that, figure, scotland, s, scapa, flow, was, the, main, base, for, the, royal, navy, in, the, 20th, century, as, the, cold, war, intensified, in, 1961, the, united, states, deployed, polaris, ballistic, missiles, and, submarines, in, the, firth, of, clyde, s, holy, loch, public, protests, from, cnd, campaigners, proved, futile, the, royal, navy, successfully, convinced, the, government, to, allow, the, base, because, it, wanted, its, own, polaris, submarines, and, it, obtained, them, in, 1963, the, rn, s, nuclear, submarine, base, opened, with, four, resolution, class, polaris, submarines, at, the, expanded, faslane, naval, base, on, the, gare, loch, the, first, patrol, of, a, trident, armed, submarine, occurred, in,

of, a, nuclear, attack, the, bunker, was, 40, metres, in, depth, and, was, constructed, using, a, shell, encased, in, three, metre, solid, concrete, in, order, to, deflect, a, nuclear, attack, the, facility, remained, in, use, until, 1992, and, was, later, redeveloped, into, a, museum, in, 1994, the, nuclear, facility, at, dounreay, in, the, highland, area, of, scotland, was, one, of, the, 52, known, nuclear, targets, of, the, soviet, union, until, at, least, 1990, following, world, war, ii, scotland, s, economic, situation, became, progressively, worse, due, to, overseas, competition, inefficient, industry, and, industrial, disputes, this, only, began, to, change, in, the, 1970s, partly, due, to, the, discovery, and, development, of, north, sea, oil, and, gas, and, partly, as, scotland, moved, towards, a, more, service, based, economy, this, period, saw, the, emergence, of, the, scottish, national, party, and, movements, for, both, scottish, independence, and, more,
