the, normans, norman, normaunds, french, normands, latin, nortmanni, normanni, were, a, population, arising, in, the, medieval, duchy, of, normandy, from, the, intermingling, between, norse, viking, settlers, and, locals, of, west, francia, the, norse, settlements, in, west, francia, followed, a, series, of, raids, on, the, french, northern, coast, mainly, from, what, is, now, denmark, although, some, also, sailed, from, norway, and, sweden, these, settlements, were, finally, legitimized, when, rollo, a, scandinavian, viking, leader, agreed, to, swear, fealty, to, king, charles, iii, of, west, francia, following, the, siege, of, chartres, in, 911, the, intermixing, in, normandy, produced, an, ethnic, and, cultural, norman, identity, in, the, first, half, of, the, 10th, century, an, identity, which, continued, to, evolve, over, the, centuries, the, normans, adopted, the, culture, and, language, of, the, french, while, they, continued, the, martial, tradition, of, their, viking, ancestors, as, mercenaries, and, adventurers, in, the, 11th, century, normans, from, the, duchy, conquered, england, and, southern, italy, the, norman, dynasty, had, a, major, political, cultural, and, military, impact, on, medieval, europe, and, the, near, east, the, normans, were, historically, famed, for, their, martial, spirit, and, eventually, for, their, catholic, piety, becoming, exponents, of, the, catholic, orthodoxy, of, the, romance, community, the, original, norse, settlers, adopted, the, gallo, romance, language, of, the, frankish, land, they, settled, with, their, old, norman, dialect, becoming, known, as, norman, normaund, or, norman, french, an, important, literary, language, which, is, still, spoken, today, in, parts, of, mainland, normandy, cotentinais, and, cauchois, dialects, and, the, nearby, channel, islands, j, rriais, and, guern, siais, the, duchy, of, normandy, which, arose, from, the, treaty, of, saint, clair, sur, epte, was, a, great, fief, of, medieval, france, the, norman, dukes, exercised, independent, control, of, their, holdings, in, normandy, while, at, the, same, time, being, vassals, owing, fealty, to, the, king, of, france, and, under, richard, i, of, normandy, byname, richard, sans, peur, meaning, richard, the, fearless, the, duchy, was, forged, into, a, cohesive, and, formidable, principality, in, feudal, tenure, by, the, end, of, his, reign, in, 996, the, descendants, of, the, norse, settlers, had, become, not, only, christians, but, in, all, essentials, frenchmen, they, had, adopted, the, french, language, french, legal, ideas, and, french, social, customs, and, had, practically, merged, with, the, frankish, or, gallic, population, among, whom, they, lived, between, 1066, and, 1204, as, a, result, of, the, norman, conquest, of, england, most, of, the, kings, of, england, were, also, dukes, of, normandy, in, 1204, philip, ii, of, france, seized, mainland, normandy, by, force, of, arms, having, earlier, declared, the, duchy, of, normandy, to, be, forfeit, to, him, it, remained, a, disputed, territory, until, the, treaty, of, paris, of, 1259, when, the, english, sovereign, ceded, his, claim, to, the, duchy, except, for, the, channel, islands, in, the, present, day, the, channel, islands, the, bailiwick, of, guernsey, and, the, bailiwick, of, jersey, are, considered, to, be, officially, the, last, remnants, of, the, duchy, of, normandy, and, are, not, part, of, the, united, kingdom, but, are, instead, self, governing, crown, dependencies, the, normans, are, noted, both, for, their, culture, such, as, their, unique, romanesque, architecture, and, musical, traditions, and, for, their, significant, military, accomplishments, and, innovations, norman, adventurers, played, a, role, in, founding, the, kingdom, of, sicily, under, roger, ii, after, briefly, conquering, southern, italy, and, malta, from, the, saracens, and, byzantines, and, an, expedition, on, behalf, of, their, duke, william, the, conqueror, led, to, the, norman, conquest, of, england, at, the, battle, of, hastings, in, 1066, norman, and, anglo, norman, forces, contributed, to, the, iberian, reconquista, from, the, early, eleventh, to, the, mid, thirteenth, centuries, norman, cultural, and, military, influence, spread, from, these, new, european, centres, to, the, crusader, states, of, the, near, east, where, their, prince, bohemond, i, founded, the, principality, of, antioch, in, the, levant, to, scotland, and, wales, in, great, britain, to, ireland, and, to, the, coasts, of, north, africa, and, the, canary, islands, the, legacy, of, the, normans, persists, today, through, the, regional, languages, and, dialects, of, france, england, spain, quebec, and, sicily, and, also, through, the, various, cultural, judicial, and, political, arrangements, they, introduced, in, their, conquered, territories, the, english, name, normans, comes, from, the, french, words, normans, normanz, plural, of, normant, modern, french, normand, which, is, itself, borrowed, from, old, low, franconian, nortmann, northman, or, directly, from, old, norse, nor, ma, r, latinized, variously, as, nortmannus, normannus, or, nordmannus, recorded, in, medieval, latin, 9th, century, to, mean, norseman, viking, the, 11th, century, benedictine, monk, and, historian, goffredo, malaterra, characterised, the, normans, thus, specially, marked, by, cunning, despising, their, own, inheritance, in, the, hope, of, winning, a, greater, eager, after, both, gain, and, dominion, given, to, imitation, of, all, kinds, holding, a, certain, mean, between, lavishness, and, greediness, that, is, perhaps, uniting, as, they, certainly, did, these, two, seemingly, opposite, qualities, their, chief, men, were, specially, lavish, through, their, desire, of, good, report, they, were, moreover, a, race, skillful, in, flattery, given, to, the, study, of, eloquence, so, that, the, very, boys, were, orators, a, race, altogether, unbridled, unless, held, firmly, down, by, the, yoke, of, justice, they, were, enduring, of, toil, hunger, and, cold, whenever, fortune, laid, it, on, them, given, to, hunting, and, hawking, delighting, in, the, pleasure, of, horses, and, of, all, the, weapons, and, garb, of, war, in, the, course, of, the, 10th, century, the, initially, destructive, incursions, of, norse, war, bands, going, upstream, into, the, rivers, of, france, penetrated, further, into, interior, europe, and, evolved, into, more, permanent, encampments, that, included, local, french, women, and, personal, property, from, 885, to, 886, odo, of, paris, eudes, de, paris, succeeded, in, defending, paris, against, viking, raiders, one, of, the, leaders, was, sigfred, with, his, fighting, skills, fortification, of, paris, and, tactical, shrewdness, in, 911, robert, i, of, france, brother, of, odo, again, defeated, another, band, of, viking, warriors, in, chartres, with, his, well, trained, horsemen, this, victory, paved, the, way, for, rollo, s, baptism, and, settlement, in, normandy, the, duchy, of, normandy, which, began, in, 911, as, a, fiefdom, was, established, by, the, treaty, of, saint, clair, sur, epte, between, king, charles, iii, charles, the, simple, 879, 929, ruled, 893, 929, of, west, francia, and, the, famed, viking, ruler, rollo, also, known, as, gaange, rolf, c, 846, c, 929, from, scandinavia, and, was, situated, in, the, former, frankish, kingdom, of, neustria, the, treaty, offered, rollo, and, his, men, the, french, coastal, lands, along, the, english, channel, between, the, river, epte, and, the, atlantic, ocean, coast, in, exchange, for, their, protection, against, further, viking, incursions, as, well, as, promising, to, protect, the, area, of, rouen, from, viking, invasion, rollo, swore, not, to, invade, further, frankish, lands, himself, accepted, baptism, and, conversion, to, christianity, and, swore, fealty, to, king, charles, iii, robert, i, of, france, stood, as, godfather, during, rollo, s, baptism, he, became, the, first, duke, of, normandy, and, count, of, rouen, the, area, corresponded, to, the, northern, part, of, present, day, upper, normandy, down, to, the, river, seine, but, the, duchy, would, eventually, extend, west, beyond, the, seine, the, territory, was, roughly, equivalent, to, the, old, province, of, rouen, and, reproduced, the, old, roman, empire, s, administrative, structure, of, gallia, lugdunensis, ii, part, of, the, former, gallia, lugdunensis, in, gaul, before, rollo, s, arrival, normandy, s, populations, did, not, differ, from, picardy, or, the, le, de, france, which, were, considered, frankish, earlier, viking, settlers, had, begun, arriving, in, the, 880s, but, were, divided, between, colonies, in, the, east, roumois, and, pays, de, caux, around, the, low, seine, valley, and, in, the, west, in, the, cotentin, peninsula, and, were, separated, by, traditional, pagii, where, the, population, remained, about, the, same, with, almost, no, foreign, settlers, rollo, s, contingents, from, scandinavia, who, raided, and, ultimately, settled, normandy, and, parts, of, the, european, atlantic, coast, included, danes, norwegians, norse, gaels, orkney, vikings, possibly, swedes, and, anglo, danes, from, the, english, danelaw, territory, which, earlier, came, under, norse, control, in, the, late, 9th, century, the, descendants, of, vikings, replaced, the, norse, religion, and, old, norse, language, with, catholicism, christianity, and, the, langue, d, oil, of, the, local, people, descending, from, the, latin, of, the, romans, the, norman, language, norman, french, was, forged, by, the, adoption, of, the, indigenous, langue, d, o, l, branch, of, romance, by, a, norse, speaking, ruling, class, and, it, developed, into, the, french, regional, languages, that, survive, today, the, new, norman, rulers, were, culturally, and, ethnically, distinct, from, the, old, french, aristocracy, most, of, whom, traced, their, lineage, to, the, franks, of, the, carolingian, dynasty, from, the, days, of, charlemagne, in, the, 9th, century, by, intermarrying, with, the, local, aristocracy, and, adopting, the, growing, feudal, doctrines, of, the, rest, of, france, the, normans, would, progressively, work, these, principles, into, a, functional, hierarchical, system, in, their, own, duchy, and, later, export, it, to, norman, dominated, england, as, the, proliferation, of, aristocratic, families, throughout, the, french, kingdom, limited, the, prospects, of, most, heirs, young, knights, were, encouraged, to, seek, land, and, riches, beyond, their, homeland, with, normandy, becoming, a, major, source, of, such, adventurers, many, normans, of, italy, france, and, england, eventually, served, as, avid, crusaders, soldiers, under, the, italo, norman, prince, bohemund, i, of, antioch, and, the, angevin, norman, king, richard, the, lion, heart, one, of, the, more, famous, and, illustrious, kings, of, england, opportunistic, bands, of, normans, successfully, established, a, foothold, in, southern, italy, probably, as, the, result, of, returning, pilgrims, stories, the, normans, entered, southern, italy, as, warriors, in, 1017, at, the, latest, in, 999, according, to, amatus, of, montecassino, norman, pilgrims, returning, from, jerusalem, called, in, at, the, port, of, salerno, when, a, muslim, attack, occurred, the, normans, fought, so, valiantly, that, prince, guaimar, iii, begged, them, to, stay, but, they, refused, and, instead, offered, to, tell, others, back, home, of, the, prince, s, request, william, of, apulia, tells, that, in, 1016, norman, pilgrims, to, the, shrine, of, the, archangel, michael, at, monte, gargano, were, met, by, melus, of, bari, a, lombard, nobleman, and, rebel, who, persuaded, them, to, return, with, more, warriors, to, help, throw, off, the, byzantine, rule, which, they, did, the, two, most, prominent, norman, families, to, arrive, in, the, mediterranean, were, descendants, of, tancred, of, hauteville, and, the, drengot, family, a, group, of, normans, with, at, least, five, brothers, from, the, drengot, family, fought, the, byzantines, in, apulia, under, the, command, of, melus, of, bari, between, 1016, and, 1024, in, a, fragmented, political, context, the, county, of, ariano, was, founded, by, another, group, of, norman, knights, headed, by, gilbert, buat, re, and, hired, by, melus, of, bari, defeated, at, cannae, melus, of, bari, escaped, to, bamberg, germany, where, he, died, in, 1022, the, county, which, replaced, the, pre, existing, chamberlainship, is, considered, to, be, the, first, political, body, established, by, the, normans, in, the, south, of, italy, then, rainulf, drengot, from, the, same, family, received, the, county, of, aversa, from, duke, sergius, iv, of, naples, in, 1030, the, hauteville, family, achieved, princely, rank, by, proclaiming, prince, guaimar, iv, of, salerno, duke, of, apulia, and, calabria, he, promptly, awarded, their, elected, leader, william, iron, arm, with, the, title, of, count, in, his, capital, of, melfi, the, drengot, family, thereafter, attained, the, principality, of, capua, and, emperor, henry, iii, legally, ennobled, the, hauteville, leader, drogo, as, dux, et, magister, italiae, comesque, normannorum, totius, apuliae, et, calabriae, duke, and, master, of, italy, and, count, of, the, normans, of, all, apulia, and, calabria, in, 1047, from, these, bases, the, normans, eventually, captured, sicily, and, malta, from, the, muslims, under, the, leadership, of, the, famous, robert, guiscard, a, hauteville, and, his, younger, brother, roger, the, great, count, roger, s, son, roger, ii, of, sicily, was, crowned, king, in, 1130, exactly, one, century, after, rainulf, was, crowned, count, by, antipope, anacletus, ii, the, kingdom, of, sicily, lasted, until, 1194, when, it, was, transferred, to, the, house, of, hohenstaufen, through, marriage, the, normans, left, their, legacy, in, many, castles, such, as, william, iron, arm, s, citadel, at, squillace, and, cathedrals, such, as, roger, ii, s, cappella, palatina, at, palermo, which, dot, the, landscape, and, give, a, distinct, architectural, flavor, to, accompany, its, unique, history, institutionally, the, normans, combined, the, administrative, machinery, of, the, byzantines, arabs, and, lombards, with, their, own, conceptions, of, feudal, law, and, order, to, forge, a, unique, government, under, this, state, there, was, great, religious, freedom, and, alongside, the, norman, nobles, existed, a, meritocratic, bureaucracy, of, jews, muslims, and, christians, both, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, the, kingdom, of, sicily, thus, became, characterized, by, norman, byzantine, greek, arab, lombard, and, native, sicilian, populations, living, in, harmony, and, its, norman, rulers, fostered, plans, of, establishing, an, empire, that, would, have, encompassed, fatimid, egypt, as, well, as, the, crusader, states, in, the, levant, one, of, the, great, geographical, treatises, of, the, middle, ages, the, tabula, rogeriana, was, written, by, al, idrisi, for, king, roger, ii, of, sicily, and, entitled, kitab, rudjdjar, the, book, of, roger, the, normans, began, appearing, in, the, military, confrontations, between, christians, and, muslims, in, the, iberian, peninsula, since, the, early, eleventh, century, the, first, norman, who, appears, in, the, narrative, sources, was, roger, i, of, tosny, who, according, to, ademar, of, chabannes, and, the, later, chronicle, of, st, pierre, le, vif, went, to, aid, the, barcelonese, in, a, series, of, raids, against, the, andalusi, muslims, c, 1018, later, in, the, eleventh, century, other, norman, adventurers, such, as, robert, crispin, and, walter, giffard, participated, in, the, probably, papal, organised, siege, of, barbastro, of, 1064, even, after, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, 1066, the, normans, continued, to, participate, in, ventures, in, the, peninsula, after, the, frankish, conquest, of, the, holy, land, during, the, first, crusade, the, normans, began, to, be, encouraged, to, participate, in, ventures, of, conquest, in, the, northeast, of, the, peninsula, the, most, significant, example, of, this, was, the, incursion, of, rotrou, ii, of, perche, and, robert, burdet, in, the, 1120s, in, the, ebro, frontier, by, 1129, robert, burdet, had, been, granted, a, semi, independent, principality, in, the, city, of, tarragona, by, the, then, archbishop, of, this, see, oleguer, bonestruga, several, others, of, rotrou, s, norman, followers, were, rewarded, with, lands, in, the, ebro, valley, by, king, alfonso, i, of, aragon, for, their, services, with, the, rising, popularity, of, the, sea, route, to, the, holy, land, norman, and, anglo, norman, crusaders, also, started, to, be, encouraged, locally, by, iberian, prelates, to, participate, in, the, portuguese, incursions, into, the, western, areas, of, the, peninsula, the, first, of, these, incursions, occurred, when, a, fleet, of, these, crusaders, was, invited, by, the, portuguese, king, afonso, i, henriques, to, conquer, the, city, of, lisbon, in, 1142, although, this, siege, of, lisbon, 1142, was, a, failure, it, created, a, precedent, for, their, involvement, in, portugal, so, in, 1147, when, another, group, of, norman, and, other, groups, of, crusaders, from, northern, europe, arrived, in, porto, on, their, way, to, join, the, crusading, forces, of, the, second, crusade, the, bishop, of, porto, and, later, afonso, henriques, according, to, de, expugnatione, lyxbonensi, convinced, them, to, help, with, the, siege, of, lisbon, this, time, the, city, was, captured, and, according, to, the, arrangement, agreed, upon, with, the, portuguese, monarch, many, of, them, settled, in, the, newly, sacked, city, the, following, year, the, remainder, of, the, crusading, fleet, including, a, substantial, number, of, anglo, normans, was, invited, by, the, count, of, barcelona, ramon, berenguer, iv, to, participate, in, the, siege, of, tortosa, 1148, again, the, normans, were, rewarded, with, lands, in, the, newly, conquered, frontier, city, between, 1135, and, 1160, the, norman, kingdom, of, sicily, conquered, and, kept, as, vassals, several, cities, on, the, ifriqiya, coast, corresponding, to, tunisia, and, parts, of, algeria, and, libya, today, they, were, lost, to, the, almohads, soon, after, the, normans, began, to, enter, italy, they, entered, the, byzantine, empire, and, then, armenia, fighting, against, the, pechenegs, the, bulgarians, and, especially, the, seljuk, turks, norman, mercenaries, were, first, encouraged, to, come, to, the, south, by, the, lombards, to, act, against, the, byzantines, but, they, soon, fought, in, byzantine, service, in, sicily, they, were, prominent, alongside, varangian, and, lombard, contingents, in, the, sicilian, campaign, of, george, maniaces, in, 1038, 40, there, is, debate, whether, the, normans, in, greek, service, actually, were, from, norman, italy, and, it, now, seems, likely, only, a, few, came, from, there, it, is, also, unknown, how, many, of, the, franks, as, the, byzantines, called, them, were, normans, and, not, other, frenchmen, one, of, the, first, norman, mercenaries, to, serve, as, a, byzantine, general, was, herv, in, the, 1050s, by, then, however, there, were, already, norman, mercenaries, serving, as, far, away, as, trebizond, and, georgia, they, were, based, at, malatya, and, edessa, under, the, byzantine, duke, of, antioch, isaac, komnenos, in, the, 1060s, robert, crispin, led, the, normans, of, edessa, against, the, turks, roussel, de, bailleul, even, tried, to, carve, out, an, independent, state, in, asia, minor, with, support, from, the, local, population, in, 1073, but, he, was, stopped, in, 1075, by, the, byzantine, general, and, future, emperor, alexius, komnenos, some, normans, joined, turkish, forces, to, aid, in, the, destruction, of, the, armenian, vassal, states, of, sassoun, and, taron, in, far, eastern, anatolia, later, many, took, up, service, with, the, armenian, state, further, south, in, cilicia, and, the, taurus, mountains, a, norman, named, oursel, led, a, force, of, franks, into, the, upper, euphrates, valley, in, northern, syria, from, 1073, to, 1074, 8, 000, of, the, 20, 000, troops, of, the, armenian, general, philaretus, brachamius, were, normans, formerly, of, oursel, led, by, raimbaud, they, even, lent, their, ethnicity, to, the, name, of, their, castle, afranji, meaning, franks, the, known, trade, between, amalfi, and, antioch, and, between, bari, and, tarsus, may, be, related, to, the, presence, of, italo, normans, in, those, cities, while, amalfi, and, bari, were, under, norman, rule, in, italy, several, families, of, byzantine, greece, were, of, norman, mercenary, origin, during, the, period, of, the, comnenian, restoration, when, byzantine, emperors, were, seeking, out, western, european, warriors, the, raoulii, were, descended, from, an, italo, norman, named, raoul, the, petraliphae, were, descended, from, a, pierre, d, aulps, and, that, group, of, albanian, clans, known, as, the, maniakates, were, descended, from, normans, who, served, under, george, maniaces, in, the, sicilian, expedition, of, 1038, robert, guiscard, another, norman, adventurer, previously, elevated, to, the, dignity, of, count, of, apulia, as, the, result, of, his, military, successes, ultimately, drove, the, byzantines, out, of, southern, italy, having, obtained, the, consent, of, pope, gregory, vii, and, acting, as, his, vassal, robert, continued, his, campaign, conquering, the, balkan, peninsula, as, a, foothold, for, western, feudal, lords, and, the, catholic, church, after, allying, himself, with, croatia, and, the, catholic, cities, of, dalmatia, in, 1081, he, led, an, army, of, 30, 000, men, in, 300, ships, landing, on, the, southern, shores, of, albania, capturing, valona, kanina, jericho, orikumi, and, reaching, butrint, after, numerous, pillages, they, joined, the, fleet, that, had, previously, conquered, corfu, and, attacked, dyrrachium, from, land, and, sea, devastating, everything, along, the, way, under, these, harsh, circumstances, the, locals, accepted, the, call, of, emperor, alexios, i, comnenos, to, join, forces, with, the, byzantines, against, the, normans, the, byzantine, forces, could, not, take, part, in, the, ensuing, battle, because, it, had, started, before, their, arrival, immediately, before, the, battle, the, venetian, fleet, had, secured, a, victory, in, the, coast, surrounding, the, city, forced, to, retreat, alexios, ceded, the, city, of, dyrrachium, to, the, count, of, the, tent, or, byzantine, provincial, administrators, mobilizing, from, arbanon, i, e, the, term, is, short, for, meaning, count, of, the, tent, the, city, s, garrison, resisted, until, february, 1082, when, dyrrachium, was, betrayed, to, the, normans, by, the, venetian, and, amalfitan, merchants, who, had, settled, there, the, normans, were, now, free, to, penetrate, into, the, hinterland, they, took, ioannina, and, some, minor, cities, in, southwestern, macedonia, and, thessaly, before, appearing, at, the, gates, of, thessalonica, dissension, among, the, high, ranks, coerced, the, normans, to, retreat, to, italy, they, lost, dyrrachium, valona, and, butrint, in, 1085, after, the, death, of, robert, a, few, years, after, the, first, crusade, in, 1107, the, normans, under, the, command, of, bohemond, robert, s, son, landed, in, valona, and, besieged, dyrrachium, using, the, most, sophisticated, military, equipment, of, the, time, but, to, no, avail, meanwhile, they, occupied, petrela, the, citadel, of, mili, at, the, banks, of, the, river, deabolis, gllavenica, ballsh, kanina, and, jericho, this, time, the, albanians, sided, with, the, normans, dissatisfied, by, the, heavy, taxes, the, byzantines, had, imposed, upon, them, with, their, help, the, normans, secured, the, arbanon, passes, and, opened, their, way, to, dibra, the, lack, of, supplies, disease, and, byzantine, resistance, forced, bohemond, to, retreat, from, his, campaign, and, sign, a, peace, treaty, with, the, byzantines, in, the, city, of, deabolis, the, further, decline, of, byzantine, state, of, affairs, paved, the, road, to, a, third, attack, in, 1185, when, a, large, norman, army, invaded, dyrrachium, owing, to, the, betrayal, of, high, byzantine, officials, some, time, later, dyrrachium, one, of, the, most, important, naval, bases, of, the, adriatic, fell, again, to, byzantine, hands, the, normans, were, in, contact, with, england, from, an, early, date, not, only, were, their, original, viking, brethren, still, ravaging, the, english, coasts, they, occupied, most, of, the, important, ports, opposite, england, across, the, english, channel, this, relationship, eventually, produced, closer, ties, of, blood, through, the, marriage, of, emma, sister, of, duke, richard, ii, of, normandy, and, king, ethelred, ii, of, england, because, of, this, ethelred, fled, to, normandy, in, 1013, when, he, was, forced, from, his, kingdom, by, sweyn, forkbeard, his, stay, in, normandy, until, 1016, influenced, him, and, his, sons, by, emma, who, stayed, in, normandy, after, cnut, the, great, s, conquest, of, the, isle, when, edward, the, confessor, finally, returned, from, his, father, s, refuge, in, 1041, at, the, invitation, of, his, half, brother, harthacnut, he, brought, with, him, a, norman, educated, mind, he, also, brought, many, norman, counsellors, and, fighters, some, of, whom, established, an, english, cavalry, force, this, concept, never, really, took, root, but, it, is, a, typical, example, of, edward, s, attitude, he, appointed, robert, of, jumi, ges, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, made, ralph, the, timid, earl, of, hereford, on, 14, october, 1066, william, the, conqueror, gained, a, decisive, victory, at, the, battle, of, hastings, which, led, to, the, conquest, of, england, three, years, later, this, can, be, seen, on, the, bayeux, tapestry, the, invading, normans, and, their, descendants, largely, replaced, the, anglo, saxons, as, the, ruling, class, of, england, the, nobility, of, england, were, part, of, a, single, norman, culture, and, many, had, lands, on, both, sides, of, the, channel, early, norman, kings, of, england, as, dukes, of, normandy, owed, homage, to, the, king, of, france, for, their, land, on, the, continent, they, considered, england, to, be, their, most, important, holding, it, brought, with, it, the, title, of, king, an, important, status, symbol, eventually, the, normans, merged, with, the, natives, combining, languages, and, traditions, so, much, so, that, marjorie, chibnall, says, writers, still, referred, to, normans, and, english, but, the, terms, no, longer, meant, the, same, as, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, 1066, in, the, course, of, the, hundred, years, war, the, norman, aristocracy, often, identified, themselves, as, english, the, anglo, norman, language, became, distinct, from, the, french, spoken, in, paris, something, that, was, the, subject, of, some, humour, by, geoffrey, chaucer, the, anglo, norman, language, was, eventually, absorbed, into, the, anglo, saxon, language, of, their, subjects, see, old, english, and, influenced, it, helping, along, with, the, norse, language, of, the, earlier, anglo, norse, settlers, and, the, latin, used, by, the, church, in, the, development, of, middle, english, which, in, turn, evolved, into, modern, english, the, normans, had, a, profound, effect, on, irish, culture, and, history, after, their, invasion, at, bannow, bay, in, 1169, initially, the, normans, maintained, a, distinct, culture, and, ethnicity, yet, with, time, they, came, to, be, subsumed, into, irish, culture, to, the, point, that, it, has, been, said, that, they, became, more, irish, than, the, irish, themselves, the, normans, settled, mostly, in, an, area, in, the, east, of, ireland, later, known, as, the, pale, and, also, built, many, fine, castles, and, settlements, including, trim, castle, and, dublin, castle, the, cultures, intermixed, borrowing, from, each, other, s, language, culture, and, outlook, norman, surnames, still, exist, today, names, such, as, french, de, roche, devereux, d, arcy, and, lacy, are, particularly, common, in, the, southeast, of, ireland, especially, in, the, southern, part, of, wexford, county, where, the, first, norman, settlements, were, established, other, norman, names, such, as, furlong, predominate, there, another, common, norman, irish, name, was, morell, murrell, derived, from, the, french, norman, name, morel, names, beginning, with, fitz, from, the, norman, for, son, usually, indicate, norman, ancestry, hiberno, norman, surnames, with, the, prefix, fitz, include, fitzgerald, fitzgibbons, gibbons, as, well, as, fitzmaurice, families, bearing, such, surnames, as, barry, de, barra, and, de, b, rca, burke, are, also, of, norman, extraction, one, of, the, claimants, of, the, english, throne, opposing, william, the, conqueror, edgar, atheling, eventually, fled, to, scotland, king, malcolm, iii, of, scotland, married, edgar, s, sister, margaret, and, came, into, opposition, to, william, who, had, already, disputed, scotland, s, southern, borders, william, invaded, scotland, in, 1072, riding, as, far, as, abernethy, where, he, met, up, with, his, fleet, of, ships, malcolm, submitted, paid, homage, to, william, and, surrendered, his, son, duncan, as, a, hostage, beginning, a, series, of, arguments, as, to, whether, the, scottish, crown, owed, allegiance, to, the, king, of, england, normans, went, into, scotland, building, castles, and, founding, noble, families, that, would, provide, some, future, kings, such, as, robert, the, bruce, as, well, as, founding, a, considerable, number, of, the, scottish, clans, king, david, i, of, scotland, whose, elder, brother, alexander, i, had, married, sybilla, of, normandy, was, instrumental, in, introducing, normans, and, norman, culture, to, scotland, part, of, the, process, some, scholars, call, the, davidian, revolution, having, spent, time, at, the, court, of, henry, i, of, england, married, to, david, s, sister, maud, of, scotland, and, needing, them, to, wrestle, the, kingdom, from, his, half, brother, m, el, coluim, mac, alaxandair, david, had, to, reward, many, with, lands, the, process, was, continued, under, david, s, successors, most, intensely, of, all, under, william, the, lion, the, norman, derived, feudal, system, was, applied, in, varying, degrees, to, most, of, scotland, scottish, families, of, the, names, bruce, gray, ramsay, fraser, rose, ogilvie, montgomery, sinclair, pollock, burnard, douglas, and, gordon, to, name, but, a, few, and, including, the, later, royal, house, of, stewart, can, all, be, traced, back, to, norman, ancestry, even, before, the, norman, conquest, of, england, the, normans, had, come, into, contact, with, wales, edward, the, confessor, had, set, up, the, aforementioned, ralph, as, earl, of, hereford, and, charged, him, with, defending, the, marches, and, warring, with, the, welsh, in, these, original, ventures, the, normans, failed, to, make, any, headway, into, wales, after, the, conquest, however, the, marches, came, completely, under, the, dominance, of, william, s, most, trusted, norman, barons, including, bernard, de, neufmarch, roger, of, montgomery, in, shropshire, and, hugh, lupus, in, cheshire, these, normans, began, a, long, period, of, slow, conquest, during, which, almost, all, of, wales, was, at, some, point, subject, to, norman, interference, norman, words, such, as, baron, barwn, first, entered, welsh, at, that, time, the, legendary, religious, zeal, of, the, normans, was, exercised, in, religious, wars, long, before, the, first, crusade, carved, out, a, norman, principality, in, antioch, they, were, major, foreign, combatants, in, the, reconquista, in, iberia, in, 1018, roger, de, tosny, travelled, to, the, iberian, peninsula, to, carve, out, a, state, for, himself, from, moorish, lands, but, failed, in, 1064, during, the, war, of, barbastro, william, of, montreuil, roger, crispin, and, probably, walter, guiffard, led, an, army, under, the, papal, hanner, which, took, a, huge, booty, as, they, captured, the, city, from, its, andelusi, rulers, later, a, group, of, normans, led, by, certain, william, some, have, suggested, this, was, william, the, carpenter, participated, in, the, failed, siege, of, tudela, of, 1087, in, 1096, crusaders, passing, by, the, siege, of, amalfi, were, joined, by, bohemond, of, taranto, and, his, nephew, tancred, with, an, army, of, italo, normans, bohemond, was, the, de, facto, leader, of, the, crusade, during, its, passage, through, asia, minor, after, the, successful, siege, of, antioch, in, 1097, bohemond, began, carving, out, an, independent, principality, around, that, city, tancred, was, instrumental, in, the, conquest, of, jerusalem, and, he, worked, for, the, expansion, of, the, crusader, kingdom, in, transjordan, and, the, region, of, galilee, after, the, first, crusade, to, the, levant, the, normans, continued, with, their, involvement, in, iberia, as, well, as, other, areas, of, the, mediterranean, among, them, was, rotrou, of, perche, and, his, followers, robert, burdet, and, william, giffard, who, joined, multiple, expeditions, into, the, ebro, valley, to, aid, alfonso, i, of, aragon, in, his, campaigns, of, conquest, robert, burdet, managed, to, acquire, the, position, of, alcide, of, tudela, by, 1123, and, later, that, of, prince, of, the, city, tarragona, in, 1129, the, conquest, of, cyprus, by, the, anglo, norman, forces, of, the, third, crusade, opened, a, new, chapter, in, the, history, of, the, island, which, would, be, under, western, european, domination, for, the, following, 380, years, although, not, part, of, a, planned, operation, the, conquest, had, much, more, permanent, results, than, initially, expected, in, april, 1191, richard, the, lion, hearted, left, messina, with, a, large, fleet, in, order, to, reach, acre, but, a, storm, dispersed, the, fleet, after, some, searching, it, was, discovered, that, the, boat, carrying, his, sister, and, his, fianc, e, berengaria, was, anchored, on, the, south, coast, of, cyprus, together, with, the, wrecks, of, several, other, ships, including, the, treasure, ship, survivors, of, the, wrecks, had, been, taken, prisoner, by, the, island, s, despot, isaac, komnenos, on, 1, may, 1191, richard, s, fleet, arrived, in, the, port, of, limassol, on, cyprus, he, ordered, isaac, to, release, the, prisoners, and, the, treasure, isaac, refused, so, richard, landed, his, troops, and, took, limassol, various, princes, of, the, holy, land, arrived, in, limassol, at, the, same, time, in, particular, guy, de, lusignan, all, declared, their, support, for, richard, provided, that, he, support, guy, against, his, rival, conrad, of, montferrat, the, local, barons, abandoned, isaac, who, considered, making, peace, with, richard, joining, him, on, the, crusade, and, offering, his, daughter, in, marriage, to, the, person, named, by, richard, but, isaac, changed, his, mind, and, tried, to, escape, richard, then, proceeded, to, conquer, the, whole, island, his, troops, being, led, by, guy, de, lusignan, isaac, surrendered, and, was, confined, with, silver, chains, because, richard, had, promised, that, he, would, not, place, him, in, irons, by, 1, june, richard, had, conquered, the, whole, island, his, exploit, was, well, publicized, and, contributed, to, his, reputation, he, also, derived, significant, financial, gains, from, the, conquest, of, the, island, richard, left, for, acre, on, 5, june, with, his, allies, before, his, departure, he, named, two, of, his, norman, generals, richard, de, camville, and, robert, de, thornham, as, governors, of, cyprus, while, in, limassol, richard, the, lion, heart, married, berengaria, of, navarre, first, born, daughter, of, king, sancho, vi, of, navarre, the, wedding, was, held, on, 12, may, 1191, at, the, chapel, of, st, george, and, it, was, attended, by, richard, s, sister, joan, whom, he, had, brought, from, sicily, the, marriage, was, celebrated, with, great, pomp, and, splendor, among, other, grand, ceremonies, was, a, double, coronation, richard, caused, himself, to, be, crowned, king, of, cyprus, and, berengaria, queen, of, england, and, queen, of, cyprus, as, well, the, rapid, anglo, norman, conquest, proved, more, important, than, it, seemed, the, island, occupied, a, key, strategic, position, on, the, maritime, lanes, to, the, holy, land, whose, occupation, by, the, christians, could, not, continue, without, support, from, the, sea, shortly, after, the, conquest, cyprus, was, sold, to, the, knights, templar, and, it, was, subsequently, acquired, in, 1192, by, guy, de, lusignan, and, became, a, stable, feudal, kingdom, it, was, only, in, 1489, that, the, venetians, acquired, full, control, of, the, island, which, remained, a, christian, stronghold, until, the, fall, of, famagusta, in, 1571, between, 1402, and, 1405, the, expedition, led, by, the, norman, noble, jean, de, bethencourt, and, the, poitevine, gadifer, de, la, salle, conquered, the, canarian, islands, of, lanzarote, fuerteventura, and, el, hierro, off, the, atlantic, coast, of, africa, their, troops, were, gathered, in, normandy, gascony, and, were, later, reinforced, by, castilian, colonists, bethencourt, took, the, title, of, king, of, the, canary, islands, as, vassal, to, henry, iii, of, castile, in, 1418, jean, s, nephew, maciot, de, bethencourt, sold, the, rights, to, the, islands, to, enrique, p, rez, de, guzm, n, 2nd, count, de, niebla, when, norse, vikings, from, scandinavia, arrived, in, the, then, province, of, neustria, and, settled, the, land, that, became, known, as, normandy, they, originally, spoke, old, norse, a, north, germanic, language, over, time, they, came, to, live, among, the, local, gallo, romance, speaking, population, with, the, two, communities, converging, to, the, point, that, the, original, norsemen, largely, assimilated, and, adopted, the, local, dialect, of, old, french, while, contributing, some, elements, from, the, old, norse, language, this, norse, influenced, dialect, which, then, arose, was, known, as, old, norman, and, it, is, the, ancestor, of, both, the, modern, norman, language, still, spoken, today, in, the, channel, islands, and, parts, of, mainland, normandy, as, well, as, the, historical, anglo, norman, language, in, england, old, norman, was, also, an, important, language, of, the, principality, of, antioch, during, crusader, rule, in, the, levant, old, norman, and, anglo, norman, literature, was, quite, extensive, during, the, middle, ages, with, records, existing, from, notable, norman, poets, such, as, wace, who, was, born, on, the, island, of, jersey, and, raised, in, mainland, normandy, the, customary, law, of, normandy, was, developed, between, the, 10th, and, 13th, centuries, and, survives, today, through, the, legal, systems, of, jersey, and, guernsey, in, the, channel, islands, norman, customary, law, was, transcribed, in, two, customaries, in, latin, by, two, judges, for, use, by, them, and, their, colleagues, these, are, the, tr, s, ancien, coutumier, very, ancient, customary, authored, between, 1200, and, 1245, and, the, grand, coutumier, de, normandie, great, customary, of, normandy, originally, summa, de, legibus, normanniae, in, curia, la, cali, authored, between, 1235, and, 1245, norman, architecture, typically, stands, out, as, a, new, stage, in, the, architectural, history, of, the, regions, they, subdued, they, spread, a, unique, romanesque, idiom, to, england, italy, and, ireland, and, the, encastellation, of, these, regions, with, keeps, in, their, north, french, style, fundamentally, altered, the, military, landscape, their, style, was, characterised, by, rounded, arches, particularly, over, windows, and, doorways, and, massive, proportions, in, england, the, period, of, norman, architecture, immediately, succeeds, that, of, the, anglo, saxon, and, precedes, the, early, gothic, in, southern, italy, the, normans, incorporated, elements, of, islamic, lombard, and, byzantine, building, techniques, into, their, own, initiating, a, unique, romanesque, style, known, as, norman, arab, architecture, within, the, kingdom, of, sicily, and, precedes, the, early, gothic, in, the, visual, arts, the, normans, did, not, have, the, rich, and, distinctive, traditions, of, the, cultures, they, conquered, however, in, the, early, 11th, century, the, dukes, began, a, programme, of, church, reform, encouraging, the, cluniac, reform, of, monasteries, and, patronising, intellectual, pursuits, especially, the, proliferation, of, scriptoria, and, the, reconstitution, of, a, compilation, of, lost, illuminated, manuscripts, the, church, was, utilised, by, the, dukes, as, a, unifying, force, for, their, disparate, duchy, the, chief, monasteries, taking, part, in, this, renaissance, of, norman, art, and, scholarship, were, mont, saint, michel, f, camp, jumi, ges, bec, saint, ouen, saint, evroul, and, saint, wandrille, these, centres, were, in, contact, with, the, so, called, winchester, school, which, channeled, a, pure, carolingian, artistic, tradition, to, normandy, in, the, final, decade, of, the, 11th, and, first, of, the, 12th, century, normandy, experienced, a, golden, age, of, illustrated, manuscripts, but, it, was, brief, and, the, major, scriptoria, of, normandy, ceased, to, function, after, the, midpoint, of, the, century, the, french, wars, of, religion, in, the, 16th, century, and, the, french, revolution, in, the, 18th, successively, destroyed, much, of, what, existed, in, the, way, of, the, architectural, and, artistic, remnant, of, this, norman, creativity, the, former, with, their, violence, caused, the, wanton, destruction, of, many, norman, edifices, the, latter, with, its, assault, on, religion, caused, the, purposeful, destruction, of, religious, objects, of, any, type, and, its, destabilisation, of, society, resulted, in, rampant, pillaging, by, far, the, most, famous, work, of, norman, art, is, the, bayeux, tapestry, which, is, not, a, tapestry, but, a, work, of, embroidery, it, was, commissioned, by, odo, the, bishop, of, bayeux, and, first, earl, of, kent, employing, natives, from, kent, who, were, learned, in, the, nordic, traditions, imported, in, the, previous, half, century, by, the, danish, vikings, in, britain, norman, art, primarily, survives, as, stonework, or, metalwork, such, as, capitals, and, baptismal, fonts, in, southern, italy, however, norman, artwork, survives, plentifully, in, forms, strongly, influenced, by, its, greek, lombard, and, arab, forebears, of, the, royal, regalia, preserved, in, palermo, the, crown, is, germanic, and, byzantine, in, style, and, the, coronation, cloak, is, of, arab, craftsmanship, with, arabic, inscriptions, many, churches, preserve, sculptured, fonts, capitals, and, more, importantly, mosaics, which, were, common, in, norman, italy, and, drew, heavily, on, the, greek, heritage, lombard, salerno, was, a, centre, of, ivorywork, in, the, 11th, century, and, this, continued, under, norman, domination, normandy, was, the, site, of, several, important, developments, in, the, history, of, classical, music, in, the, 11th, century, f, camp, abbey, and, saint, evroul, abbey, were, centres, of, musical, production, and, education, at, f, camp, under, two, italian, abbots, william, of, volpiano, and, john, of, ravenna, the, system, of, denoting, notes, by, letters, was, developed, and, taught, it, is, still, the, most, common, form, of, pitch, representation, in,
