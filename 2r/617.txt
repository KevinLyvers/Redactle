and, other, nearby, settlements, to, form, a, cosmopolitan, metropolis, the, reason, for, this, westward, relocation, of, the, capital, could, have, been, in, part, due, to, the, proximity, of, the,

this, village, the, kings, of, the, parthians, were, wont, to, make, their, winter, residence, thus, sparing, the, seleucians, in, order, that, the, seleucians, might, not, be, oppressed, by, having, the, scythian, folk, or, soldiery, quartered, amongst, them, because, of, the, parthian, power, therefore, ctesiphon, is, a, city, rather, than, a, village, its, size, is, such, that, it, lodges, a, great, number, of, people, and, it, has, been, equipped, with, buildings, by, the, parthians, themselves, and, it, has, been, provided, by, the, parthians, with, wares, for, sale, and, with, the, arts, that, are, pleasing, to, the, parthians, for, the, parthian, kings, are, accustomed, to, spend, the, winter, there, because, of, the, salubrity, of, the, air, but, they, summer, at, ecbatana, and, in, hyrcania, because, of, the, prevalence, of, their, ancient, renown, because, of, its, importance, ctesiphon, was, a, major, military, objective, for, the, leaders, of, the, roman, empire, in, their, eastern, wars, the, city, was, captured, by, rome, five, times, in, its, history, three, times, in, the, 2nd, century, alone, the, emperor, trajan, captured, ctesiphon, in, 116, but, his,

greatly, enlarged, and, flourished, during, their, rule, thus, turning, into, a, metropolis, which, was, known, by, in, arabic, as, al, mada, in, and, in, aramaic, as, mahoze, the, oldest, inhabited, places, of, ctesiphon, were, on, its, eastern, side, which, in, islamic, arabic, sources, is, called, the, old, city, mad, nah, al, at, qah, where, the, residence, of, the, sasanians, known, as, the, white, palace, was, located, the, southern, side, of, ctesiphon, was, known, as, asb, nbar, or, asp, nbar, which, was, known, by, its, prominent, halls, riches, games, stables, and, baths, taq, kasra,

a, period, of, civil, upheaval, in, 295, emperor, galerius, was, defeated, outside, the, city, that, however, he, returned, a, year, later, won, a, victory, which, ended, in, the, fifth, and, final, capture, of, the, city, by, the, romans, in, 299, is, still, speculative, according, to, roman, historian, udo, hartmann, several, other, scholars, also, highly, unlikely, hence, that, he, returned, it, to, the, persian, king, narses, in, exchange, for, armenia, and, western, mesopotamia, is, also, likely, to, have, never, happened, in, c, 325, and, again, in, 410, the, city, or, the, greek,
