phoenicia, f, n, f, n, i, or, ph, nicia, was, an, ancient, semitic, thalassocratic, civilization, originating, in, the, coastal, strip, of, the, levant, region, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, primarily, located, in, modern, lebanon, the, territory, of, the, phoenicians, expanded, and, contracted, throughout, history, with, the, core, of, their, culture, stretching, from, arwad, in, modern, syria, to, mount, carmel, in, modern, israel, beyond, their, homeland, the, phoenicians, extended, through, trade, and, colonization, throughout, the, mediterranean, from, cyprus, to, the, iberian, peninsula, the, phoenicians, directly, succeeded, the, bronze, age, canaanites, continuing, their, cultural, traditions, following, the, decline, of, most, major, cultures, in, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, and, into, the, iron, age, without, interruption, it, is, believed, that, they, self, identified, as, canaanites, and, referred, to, their, land, as, canaan, indicating, a, continuous, cultural, and, geographical, association, the, name, phoenicia, is, an, ancient, greek, exonym, that, did, not, correspond, precisely, to, a, cohesive, culture, or, society, as, it, would, have, been, understood, natively, therefore, the, division, between, canaanites, and, phoenicians, around, 1200, bc, is, regarded, as, a, modern, and, artificial, division, the, phoenicians, known, for, their, prowess, in, trade, seafaring, and, navigation, dominated, commerce, across, classical, antiquity, and, developed, an, expansive, maritime, trade, network, lasting, over, a, millennium, this, network, facilitated, cultural, exchanges, among, major, cradles, of, civilization, such, as, greece, egypt, and, mesopotamia, the, phoenicians, established, colonies, and, trading, posts, across, the, mediterranean, carthage, a, settlement, in, northwest, africa, became, a, major, civilization, in, its, own, right, in, the, seventh, century, bc, the, phoenicians, were, organized, in, city, states, similar, to, those, of, ancient, greece, of, which, the, most, notable, were, tyre, sidon, and, byblos, each, city, state, was, politically, independent, and, there, is, no, evidence, the, phoenicians, viewed, themselves, as, a, single, nationality, while, most, city, states, were, governed, by, some, form, of, kingship, merchant, families, probably, exercised, influence, through, oligarchies, after, reaching, its, zenith, in, the, ninth, century, bc, the, phoenician, civilization, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, gradually, declined, due, to, external, influences, and, conquests, yet, their, presence, persisted, in, the, central, and, western, mediterranean, until, the, destruction, of, carthage, in, the, mid, second, century, bc, the, phoenicians, were, long, considered, a, lost, civilization, due, to, the, lack, of, indigenous, written, records, and, only, since, the, mid, 20th, century, have, historians, and, archaeologists, been, able, to, reveal, a, complex, and, influential, civilization, their, best, known, legacy, is, the, world, s, oldest, verified, alphabet, whose, origin, was, connected, to, that, of, the, hebrew, script, via, the, proto, sinaitic, script, and, which, was, transmitted, across, the, mediterranean, and, used, to, develop, the, arabic, script, and, greek, alphabet, and, in, turn, the, latin, and, cyrillic, alphabets, the, phoenicians, are, also, credited, with, innovations, in, shipbuilding, navigation, industry, agriculture, and, government, their, international, trade, network, is, believed, to, have, fostered, the, economic, political, and, cultural, foundations, of, classical, western, civilization, being, a, society, of, independent, city, states, the, phoenicians, apparently, did, not, have, a, term, to, denote, the, land, of, phoenicia, as, a, whole, instead, demonyms, were, often, derived, from, the, name, of, the, city, an, individual, hailed, from, e, g, sidonian, for, sidon, tyrian, for, tyre, etc, if, the, phoenicians, had, an, endonym, to, denote, the, land, overall, some, scholars, believe, that, they, would, have, used, canaan, and, therefore, referred, to, themselves, as, canaanites, krahmalkov, reconstructs, the, honeyman, inscription, dated, to, c, 900, bc, by, william, f, albright, as, containing, a, reference, to, the, phoenician, homeland, calling, it, p, t, phoenician, obelisks, at, karnak, contain, references, to, a, land, of, fn, w, fn, w, being, the, plural, form, of, fn, the, ancient, egyptian, word, for, carpenter, this, land, of, carpenters, is, generally, identified, as, phoenicia, given, that, phoenicia, played, a, central, role, in, the, lumber, trade, of, the, levant, as, an, exonym, fn, w, was, evidently, borrowed, into, greek, as, pho, nix, which, meant, variably, phoenician, person, tyrian, purple, crimson, or, date, palm, homer, used, it, with, each, of, these, meanings, the, word, is, already, attested, in, mycenaean, greek, linear, b, from, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, as, po, ni, ki, jo, in, those, records, it, means, crimson, or, palm, tree, and, does, not, denote, a, group, of, people, the, name, phoenicians, like, latin, poen, adj, poenicus, later, p, nicus, comes, from, greek, phoin, k, poenulus, a, latin, comedic, play, written, in, the, early, 2nd, century, bc, appears, to, preserve, a, punic, term, for, phoenicians, which, may, be, reconstructed, as, p, nn, m, since, little, has, survived, of, phoenician, records, or, literature, most, of, what, is, known, about, their, origins, and, history, comes, from, the, accounts, of, other, civilizations, and, inferences, from, their, material, culture, excavated, throughout, the, mediterranean, the, scholarly, consensus, is, that, the, phoenicians, period, of, greatest, prominence, was, 1200, bc, to, the, end, of, the, persian, period, 332, bc, it, is, debated, whether, phoenicians, were, actually, distinct, from, the, broader, group, of, semitic, speaking, peoples, known, as, canaanites, historian, robert, drews, believes, the, term, canaanites, corresponds, to, the, ethnic, group, referred, to, as, phoenicians, by, the, ancient, greeks, archaeologist, jonathan, n, tubb, argues, that, ammonites, moabites, israelites, and, phoenicians, undoubtedly, achieved, their, own, cultural, identities, and, yet, ethnically, they, were, all, canaanites, the, same, people, who, settled, in, farming, villages, in, the, region, in, the, 8th, millennium, bc, 13, 14, brian, r, doak, states, that, scholars, use, phoenicians, as, a, short, hand, for, canaanites, living, in, a, set, of, cities, along, the, northern, levantine, coast, who, shared, a, language, and, material, culture, in, the, iron, i, ii, period, and, who, also, developed, an, organized, system, of, colonies, in, the, western, mediterranean, world, the, phoenician, early, bronze, age, is, largely, unknown, the, two, most, important, sites, are, byblos, and, sidon, dakerman, near, sidon, although, as, of, 2021, well, over, a, hundred, sites, remain, to, be, excavated, while, others, that, have, been, are, yet, to, be, fully, analysed, the, middle, bronze, age, was, a, generally, peaceful, time, of, increasing, population, trade, and, prosperity, though, there, was, competition, for, natural, resources, in, the, late, bronze, age, rivalry, between, egypt, the, mittani, the, hittites, and, assyria, had, a, significant, impact, on, phoenician, cities, the, canaanite, culture, that, gave, rise, to, the, phoenicians, apparently, developed, in, situ, from, the, earlier, ghassulian, chalcolithic, culture, ghassulian, itself, developed, from, the, circum, arabian, nomadic, pastoral, complex, which, in, turn, developed, from, a, fusion, of, their, ancestral, natufian, and, harifian, cultures, with, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, ppnb, farming, cultures, practicing, the, domestication, of, animals, during, the, 8, 2, kiloyear, event, which, led, to, the, neolithic, revolution, in, the, levant, the, late, bronze, age, state, of, ugarit, is, considered, quintessentially, canaanite, archaeologically, even, though, the, ugaritic, language, does, not, belong, to, the, canaanite, languages, proper, the, fourth, century, bc, greek, historian, herodotus, claimed, that, the, phoenicians, had, migrated, from, the, erythraean, sea, around, 2750, bc, and, the, first, century, ad, geographer, strabo, reports, a, claim, that, they, came, from, tylos, and, arad, bahrain, and, muharraq, some, archaeologists, working, on, the, persian, gulf, have, accepted, these, traditions, and, suggest, a, migration, connected, with, the, collapse, of, the, dilmun, civilization, c, 1750, bc, however, most, scholars, reject, the, idea, of, a, migration, archaeological, and, historical, evidence, alike, indicate, millennia, of, population, continuity, in, the, region, and, recent, genetic, research, indicates, that, present, day, lebanese, derive, most, of, their, ancestry, from, a, canaanite, related, population, the, first, known, account, of, the, phoenicians, relates, to, the, conquests, of, pharaoh, thutmose, iii, 1479, 1425, bc, the, egyptians, targeted, coastal, cities, which, they, wrote, belonged, to, the, fenekhu, carpenters, such, as, byblos, arwad, and, ullasa, for, their, crucial, geographic, and, commercial, links, with, the, interior, via, the, nahr, al, kabir, and, the, orontes, rivers, the, cities, provided, egypt, with, access, to, mesopotamian, trade, and, abundant, stocks, of, the, region, s, native, cedarwood, there, was, no, equivalent, in, the, egyptian, homeland, by, the, mid, 14th, century, bc, the, phoenician, city, states, were, considered, favored, cities, to, the, egyptians, tyre, sidon, beirut, and, byblos, were, regarded, as, the, most, important, the, phoenicians, had, considerable, autonomy, and, their, cities, were, reasonably, well, developed, and, prosperous, byblos, was, the, leading, city, it, was, a, center, for, bronze, making, and, the, primary, terminus, of, precious, goods, such, as, tin, and, lapis, lazuli, from, as, far, east, as, afghanistan, sidon, and, tyre, also, commanded, interest, among, egyptian, officials, beginning, a, pattern, of, rivalry, that, would, span, the, next, millennium, the, amarna, letters, report, that, from, 1350, to, 1300, bc, neighboring, amorites, and, hittites, were, capturing, phoenician, cities, especially, in, the, north, egypt, subsequently, lost, its, coastal, holdings, from, ugarit, in, northern, syria, to, byblos, near, central, lebanon, sometime, between, 1200, and, 1150, bc, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, severely, weakened, or, destroyed, most, civilizations, in, the, region, including, the, egyptians, and, hittites, the, phoenicians, appear, to, have, weathered, the, crisis, relatively, well, emerging, as, a, distinct, and, organized, civilization, in, 1230, bc, the, period, is, sometimes, described, as, a, phoenician, renaissance, they, filled, the, power, vacuum, caused, by, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, by, becoming, the, sole, mercantile, and, maritime, power, in, the, region, a, status, they, would, maintain, for, the, next, several, centuries, the, recovery, of, the, mediterranean, economy, can, be, credited, to, phoenician, mariners, and, merchants, who, re, established, long, distance, trade, between, egypt, and, mesopotamia, in, the, 10th, century, bc, early, into, the, iron, age, the, phoenicians, established, ports, warehouses, markets, and, settlement, all, across, the, mediterranean, and, up, to, the, southern, black, sea, colonies, were, established, on, cyprus, sardinia, the, balearic, islands, sicily, and, malta, as, well, as, the, coasts, of, north, africa, and, the, iberian, peninsula, phoenician, hacksilver, dated, to, this, period, bears, lead, isotope, ratios, matching, ores, in, sardinia, and, spain, indicating, the, extent, of, phoenician, trade, networks, by, the, tenth, century, bc, tyre, rose, to, become, the, richest, and, most, powerful, phoenician, city, state, particularly, during, the, reign, of, hiram, i, c, 969, 936, bc, the, expertise, of, phoenician, artisans, sent, by, hiram, i, of, tyre, in, significant, construction, projects, during, the, reign, of, solomon, the, king, of, israel, is, documented, in, the, bible, during, the, rule, of, the, priest, ithobaal, 887, 856, bc, tyre, expanded, its, territory, as, far, north, as, beirut, and, into, part, of, cyprus, this, unusual, act, of, aggression, was, the, closest, the, phoenicians, ever, came, to, forming, a, unitary, territorial, state, once, his, realm, reached, its, largest, territorial, extent, ithobaal, declared, himself, king, of, the, sidonians, a, title, that, would, be, used, by, his, successors, and, mentioned, in, both, greek, and, jewish, accounts, the, late, iron, age, saw, the, height, of, phoenician, shipping, mercantile, and, cultural, activity, particularly, between, 750, and, 650, bc, the, phoenician, influence, was, visible, in, the, orientalization, of, greek, cultural, and, artistic, conventions, among, their, most, popular, goods, were, fine, textiles, typically, dyed, with, tyrian, purple, homer, s, iliad, which, was, composed, during, this, period, references, the, quality, of, phoenician, clothing, and, metal, goods, carthage, was, founded, by, phoenicians, coming, from, tyre, probably, initially, as, a, station, in, the, metal, trade, with, the, southern, iberian, peninsula, the, city, s, name, in, punic, qart, ada, t, means, new, city, there, is, a, tradition, in, some, ancient, sources, such, as, philistos, of, syracuse, for, an, early, foundation, date, of, around, 1215, bc, before, the, fall, of, troy, in, 1180, bc, however, timaeus, a, greek, historian, from, sicily, c, 300, bc, places, the, foundation, of, carthage, in, 814, bc, which, is, the, date, generally, accepted, by, modern, historians, legend, including, virgil, s, aeneid, assigns, the, founding, of, the, city, to, queen, dido, carthage, would, grow, into, a, multi, ethnic, empire, spanning, north, africa, sardinia, sicily, malta, the, balearic, islands, and, southern, iberia, but, would, ultimately, be, destroyed, by, rome, in, the, punic, wars, 264, 146, bc, before, being, rebuilt, as, a, roman, city, as, a, mercantile, power, concentrated, along, a, narrow, coastal, strip, of, land, the, phoenicians, lacked, the, size, and, population, to, support, a, large, military, thus, as, neighboring, empires, began, to, rise, the, phoenicians, increasingly, fell, under, the, sway, of, foreign, rulers, who, to, varying, degrees, circumscribed, their, autonomy, the, assyrian, conquest, of, phoenicia, began, with, king, shalmaneser, iii, he, rose, to, power, in, 858, bc, and, began, a, series, of, campaigns, against, neighboring, states, the, phoenician, city, states, fell, under, his, rule, forced, to, pay, heavy, tribute, in, money, goods, and, natural, resources, initially, they, were, not, annexed, outright, they, remained, in, a, state, of, vassalage, subordinate, to, the, assyrians, but, allowed, a, certain, degree, of, freedom, this, changed, in, 744, bc, with, the, ascension, of, tiglath, pileser, iii, by, 738, bc, most, of, the, levant, including, northern, phoenicia, were, annexed, only, tyre, and, byblos, the, most, powerful, city, states, remained, tributary, states, outside, of, direct, assyrian, control, tyre, byblos, and, sidon, all, rebelled, against, assyrian, rule, in, 721, bc, sargon, ii, besieged, tyre, and, crushed, the, rebellion, his, successor, sennacherib, suppressed, further, rebellions, across, the, region, during, the, seventh, century, bc, sidon, rebelled, and, was, destroyed, by, esarhaddon, who, enslaved, its, inhabitants, and, built, a, new, city, on, its, ruins, by, the, end, of, the, century, the, assyrians, had, been, weakened, by, successive, revolts, which, led, to, their, destruction, by, the, median, empire, the, babylonians, formerly, vassals, of, the, assyrians, took, advantage, of, the, empire, s, collapse, and, rebelled, quickly, establishing, the, neo, babylonian, empire, in, its, place, phoenician, cities, revolted, several, times, throughout, the, reigns, of, the, first, babylonian, king, nabopolassar, 626, 605, bc, and, his, son, nebuchadnezzar, ii, c, 605, c, 562, bc, in, 587, bc, nebuchadnezzar, besieged, tyre, which, resisted, for, thirteen, years, but, ultimately, capitulated, under, favorable, terms, in, 539, bc, cyrus, the, great, king, and, founder, of, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, took, babylon, as, cyrus, began, consolidating, territories, across, the, near, east, the, phoenicians, apparently, made, the, pragmatic, calculation, of, themselves, to, the, persians, most, of, the, levant, was, consolidated, by, cyrus, into, a, single, satrapy, province, and, forced, to, pay, a, yearly, tribute, of, 350, talents, which, was, roughly, half, the, tribute, that, was, required, of, egypt, and, libya, the, phoenician, area, was, later, divided, into, four, vassal, kingdoms, sidon, tyre, arwad, and, byblos, which, were, allowed, considerable, autonomy, unlike, in, other, empire, areas, there, is, no, record, of, persian, administrators, governing, the, phoenician, city, states, local, phoenician, kings, were, allowed, to, remain, in, power, and, given, the, same, rights, as, persian, satraps, governors, such, as, hereditary, offices, and, minting, their, coins, the, phoenicians, remained, a, core, asset, to, the, achaemenid, empire, particularly, for, their, prowess, in, maritime, technology, and, navigation, they, furnished, the, bulk, of, the, persian, fleet, during, the, greco, persian, wars, of, the, late, fifth, century, bc, phoenicians, under, xerxes, i, built, the, xerxes, canal, and, the, pontoon, bridges, that, allowed, his, forces, to, cross, into, mainland, greece, nevertheless, they, were, harshly, punished, by, the, persian, king, following, his, defeat, at, the, battle, of, salamis, which, he, blamed, on, phoenician, cowardice, and, incompetence, in, the, mid, fourth, century, bc, king, tennes, of, sidon, led, a, failed, rebellion, against, artaxerxes, iii, enlisting, the, help, of, the, egyptians, who, were, subsequently, drawn, into, a, war, with, the, persians, the, resulting, destruction, of, sidon, led, to, the, resurgence, of, tyre, which, remained, the, dominant, phoenician, city, for, two, decades, until, the, arrival, of, alexander, the, great, phoenicia, was, one, of, the, first, areas, to, be, conquered, by, alexander, the, great, during, his, military, campaigns, across, western, asia, alexander, s, main, target, in, the, persian, levant, was, tyre, now, the, region, s, largest, and, most, important, city, it, capitulated, after, a, roughly, seven, month, siege, during, which, many, of, its, citizens, fled, to, carthage, tyre, s, refusal, to, allow, alexander, to, visit, its, temple, to, melqart, culminating, in, the, killing, of, his, envoys, led, to, a, brutal, reprisal, 2, 000, of, its, leading, citizens, were, crucified, and, a, puppet, ruler, was, installed, the, rest, of, phoenicia, easily, came, under, his, control, with, sidon, surrendering, peacefully, alexander, s, empire, had, a, hellenization, policy, whereby, hellenic, culture, religion, and, sometimes, language, were, spread, or, imposed, across, conquered, peoples, however, hellenisation, was, not, enforced, most, of, the, time, and, was, just, a, language, of, administration, until, his, death, this, was, typically, implemented, through, the, founding, of, new, cities, the, settlement, of, a, macedonian, or, greek, urban, elite, and, the, alteration, of, native, place, names, to, greek, however, there, was, no, organized, hellenization, in, phoenicia, and, with, one, or, two, minor, exceptions, all, phoenician, city, states, retained, their, native, names, while, greek, settlement, and, administration, appear, to, have, been, very, limited, the, phoenicians, maintained, cultural, and, commercial, links, with, their, western, counterparts, polybius, recounts, how, the, seleucid, king, demetrius, i, escaped, from, rome, by, boarding, a, carthaginian, ship, that, was, delivering, goods, to, tyre, the, adaptation, to, macedonian, rule, was, probably, aided, by, the, phoenicians, historical, ties, with, the, greeks, with, whom, they, shared, some, mythological, stories, and, figures, the, two, peoples, were, even, sometimes, considered, relatives, when, alexander, s, empire, collapsed, after, his, death, in, 323, bc, the, phoenicians, came, under, the, control, of, the, largest, of, its, successors, the, seleucids, the, phoenician, homeland, was, repeatedly, contested, by, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, of, egypt, during, the, forty, year, syrian, wars, coming, under, ptolemaic, rule, in, the, third, century, bc, the, seleucids, reclaimed, the, area, the, following, century, holding, it, until, the, mid, first, 2nd, century, bc, under, their, rule, the, phoenicians, were, allowed, a, considerable, degree, of, autonomy, and, self, governance, during, the, seleucid, dynastic, wars, 157, 63, bc, the, phoenician, cities, were, mainly, self, governed, many, of, them, were, fought, for, or, over, by, the, warring, factions, of, the, seleucid, royal, family, some, phoenician, regions, were, under, jewish, influence, after, the, jews, revolted, and, succeeded, in, defeating, the, seleucids, in, 164, bc, a, significant, portion, of, the, phoenician, diaspora, in, north, africa, thus, converted, to, judaism, in, the, late, millennium, bc, the, seleucid, kingdom, was, seized, by, tigranes, the, great, of, armenia, in, 82, bc, ending, the, hellenistic, influence, on, the, levant, the, people, now, known, as, phoenicians, were, a, group, of, ancient, semitic, speaking, peoples, that, emerged, in, the, levant, in, at, least, the, third, millennium, bc, phoenicians, did, not, refer, themselves, as, phoenicians, but, rather, are, thought, to, have, broadly, referred, to, themselves, as, kena, ani, meaning, canaanites, phoenicians, specifically, identified, themselves, with, the, city, they, hailed, from, e, g, sidonian, for, sidon, tyrian, for, tyre, etc, a, 2008, study, led, by, pierre, zalloua, found, that, six, subclades, of, haplogroup, j, m172, j2, thought, to, have, originated, between, the, caucasus, mountains, mesopotamia, and, the, levant, were, of, a, phoenician, signature, and, present, amongst, the, male, populations, of, coastal, lebanon, as, well, as, the, wider, levant, the, phoenician, periphery, followed, by, other, areas, of, historic, phoenician, settlement, spanning, cyprus, through, to, morocco, this, deliberate, sequential, sampling, was, an, attempt, to, develop, a, methodology, to, link, the, documented, historical, expansion, of, a, population, with, a, particular, geographic, genetic, pattern, or, patterns, the, researchers, suggested, that, the, proposed, genetic, signature, stemmed, from, a, common, source, of, related, lineages, rooted, in, lebanon, another, study, in, 2006, found, evidence, for, the, genetic, persistence, of, phoenicians, in, the, spanish, island, of, ibiza, in, 2016, the, rare, u5b2c1, maternal, haplogroup, was, identified, in, the, dna, of, a, 2, 500, year, old, male, skeleton, excavated, from, a, punic, tomb, in, tunisia, the, lineage, of, this, young, man, of, byrsa, is, believed, to, represent, early, gene, flow, from, iberia, to, the, maghreb, according, to, a, 2017, study, published, by, the, american, journal, of, human, genetics, present, day, lebanese, derive, most, of, their, ancestry, from, a, canaanite, related, population, which, therefore, implies, substantial, genetic, continuity, in, the, levant, since, at, least, the, bronze, age, more, specifically, the, research, of, geneticist, chris, tyler, smith, and, his, team, at, the, sanger, institute, in, britain, who, compared, sampled, ancient, dna, from, five, canaanite, people, who, lived, 3, 750, and, 3, 650, years, ago, to, modern, people, revealed, that, 93, percent, of, the, genetic, ancestry, of, people, in, lebanon, came, from, the, canaanites, the, other, 7, percent, was, of, a, eurasian, steppe, population, one, 2018, study, of, mitochondrial, lineages, in, sardinia, concluded, that, the, phoenicians, were, inclusive, multicultural, and, featured, significant, female, mobility, with, evidence, of, indigenous, sardinians, integrating, peacefully, and, permanently, with, semitic, phoenician, settlers, the, study, also, found, evidence, suggesting, that, south, europeans, may, have, likewise, settled, in, the, area, of, modern, lebanon, in, a, 2020, study, published, in, the, american, journal, of, human, genetics, researchers, have, shown, that, there, is, substantial, genetic, continuity, in, lebanon, since, the, bronze, age, interrupted, by, three, significant, admixture, events, during, the, iron, age, hellenistic, and, ottoman, period, in, particular, the, phoenicians, can, be, modeled, as, a, mixture, of, the, local, bronze, age, population, 63, 88, and, a, population, coming, from, the, north, related, to, ancient, anatolians, or, ancient, south, eastern, europeans, 12, 37, the, results, show, that, a, steppe, like, ancestry, typically, found, in, europeans, appears, in, the, region, starting, from, the, iron, age, the, phoenicians, served, as, intermediaries, between, the, disparate, civilizations, that, spanned, the, mediterranean, and, near, east, facilitating, the, exchange, of, goods, and, knowledge, culture, and, religious, traditions, their, expansive, and, enduring, trade, network, is, credited, with, laying, the, foundations, of, an, economically, and, culturally, cohesive, mediterranean, which, would, be, continued, by, the, greeks, and, especially, the, romans, phoenician, ties, with, the, greeks, ran, deep, the, earliest, verified, relationship, appears, to, have, begun, with, the, minoan, civilization, on, crete, 1950, 1450, bc, which, together, with, the, mycenaean, civilization, 1600, 1100, bc, is, considered, the, progenitor, of, classical, greece, archaeological, research, suggests, that, the, minoans, gradually, imported, near, eastern, goods, artistic, styles, and, customs, from, other, cultures, via, the, phoenicians, to, egypt, the, phoenicians, sold, logs, of, cedar, for, significant, sums, and, wine, beginning, in, the, eighth, century, the, wine, trade, with, egypt, is, vividly, documented, by, shipwrecks, discovered, in, 1997, in, the, open, sea, 50, kilometres, 30, mi, west, of, ascalon, israel, pottery, kilns, at, tyre, and, sarepta, produced, the, large, terracotta, jars, used, for, transporting, wine, from, egypt, the, phoenicians, bought, nubian, gold, from, elsewhere, they, obtained, other, materials, perhaps, the, most, crucial, being, silver, mostly, from, sardinia, and, the, iberian, peninsula, tin, for, making, bronze, may, have, been, acquired, from, galicia, by, way, of, the, atlantic, coast, of, southern, spain, alternatively, it, may, have, come, from, northern, europe, cornwall, or, brittany, via, the, rhone, valley, and, coastal, massalia, strabo, states, that, there, was, a, highly, lucrative, phoenician, trade, with, britain, for, tin, via, the, cassiterides, whose, location, is, unknown, but, may, have, been, off, the, northwest, coast, of, the, iberian, peninsula, phoenicia, lacked, considerable, natural, resources, other, than, its, cedar, wood, timber, was, probably, the, earliest, and, most, lucrative, source, of, wealth, neither, egypt, nor, mesopotamia, had, adequate, wood, sources, unable, to, rely, solely, on, this, limited, resource, the, phoenicians, developed, an, industrial, base, manufacturing, a, variety, of, goods, for, both, everyday, and, luxury, use, the, phoenicians, developed, or, mastered, techniques, such, as, glass, making, engraved, and, chased, metalwork, including, bronze, iron, and, gold, ivory, carving, and, woodwork, the, phoenicians, were, early, pioneers, in, mass, production, and, sold, a, variety, of, items, in, bulk, they, became, the, leading, source, of, glassware, in, antiquity, shipping, thousands, of, flasks, beads, and, other, glass, objects, across, the, mediterranean, excavations, of, colonies, in, spain, suggest, they, also, used, the, potter, s, wheel, their, exposure, to, a, wide, variety, of, cultures, allowed, them, to, manufacture, goods, for, specific, markets, the, iliad, suggests, phoenician, clothing, and, metal, goods, were, highly, prized, by, the, greeks, specialized, goods, were, designed, specifically, for, wealthier, clientele, including, ivory, reliefs, and, plaques, carved, clam, shells, sculpted, amber, and, finely, detailed, and, painted, ostrich, eggs, the, most, prized, phoenician, goods, were, fabrics, dyed, with, tyrian, purple, which, formed, a, major, part, of, phoenician, wealth, the, violet, purple, dye, derived, from, the, hypobranchial, gland, of, the, murex, marine, snail, once, profusely, available, in, coastal, waters, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, sea, but, exploited, to, local, extinction, phoenicians, may, have, discovered, the, dye, as, early, as, 1750, bc, the, phoenicians, established, a, second, production, center, for, the, dye, in, mogador, in, present, day, morocco, the, phoenicians, exclusive, command, over, the, production, and, trade, of, the, dye, combined, with, the, labor, intensive, extraction, process, made, it, very, expensive, tyrian, purple, subsequently, became, associated, with, the, upper, classes, it, soon, became, a, status, symbol, in, several, civilizations, most, notably, among, the, romans, assyrian, tribute, records, from, the, phoenicians, include, garments, of, brightly, colored, stuff, that, most, likely, included, tyrian, purple, while, the, designs, ornamentation, and, embroidery, used, in, phoenician, textiles, were, well, regarded, the, techniques, and, specific, descriptions, are, unknown, mining, operations, in, the, phoenician, homeland, were, limited, iron, was, the, only, metal, of, any, worth, the, first, large, scale, mining, operations, probably, occurred, in, cyprus, principally, for, copper, sardinia, may, have, been, colonized, almost, exclusively, for, its, mineral, resources, phoenician, settlements, were, concentrated, in, the, southern, parts, of, the, island, close, to, sources, of, copper, and, lead, piles, of, scoria, and, copper, ingots, which, appear, to, predate, roman, occupation, suggest, the, phoenicians, mined, and, processed, metals, on, the, island, the, iberian, peninsula, was, the, richest, source, of, numerous, metals, in, antiquity, including, gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and, lead, the, significant, output, of, these, metals, during, the, phoenician, and, carthaginian, occupation, strongly, implied, large, scale, mining, operations, the, carthaginians, are, documented, to, have, relied, on, slave, labor, for, mining, though, it, is, unknown, if, the, phoenicians, as, a, whole, did, so, the, most, notable, agricultural, product, was, wine, which, the, phoenicians, helped, propagate, across, the, mediterranean, the, common, grape, vine, may, have, been, domesticated, by, the, phoenicians, or, canaanites, although, it, most, likely, arrived, from, transcaucasia, via, trade, routes, across, mesopotamia, or, the, black, sea, vines, grew, readily, in, the, coastal, levant, and, wine, was, exported, to, egypt, as, early, as, the, old, kingdom, period, 2686, 2134, bc, wine, played, an, important, part, in, phoenician, religion, serving, as, the, principal, beverage, for, offerings, and, sacrifice, an, excavation, of, a, small, phoenician, town, south, of, sidon, uncovered, a, wine, factory, used, from, at, least, the, seventh, century, bc, which, is, believed, to, have, been, aimed, for, an, overseas, market, to, prevent, oxidation, vessels, were, sealed, with, a, layer, of, olive, oil, pinewood, and, resin, the, phoenicians, established, vineyards, and, wineries, in, their, colonies, in, north, africa, sicily, france, and, spain, and, may, have, taught, winemaking, to, some, of, their, trading, partners, the, ancient, iberians, began, producing, wine, from, local, grape, varieties, following, their, encounter, with, the, phoenicians, iberian, cultivars, subsequently, formed, the, basis, of, most, western, european, wine, as, early, as, 1200, bc, the, phoenicians, built, large, merchant, ships, during, the, bronze, age, they, developed, the, keel, pegged, mortise, and, tenon, joints, proved, effective, enough, to, serve, as, a, standard, until, late, into, the, roman, empire, the, phoenicians, were, possibly, the, first, to, introduce, the, bireme, around, 700, bc, an, assyrian, account, describes, phoenicians, evading, capture, with, these, ships, the, phoenicians, are, also, credited, with, inventing, the, trireme, which, was, regarded, as, the, most, advanced, and, powerful, vessel, in, the, ancient, mediterranean, world, and, was, eventually, adopted, by, the, greeks, the, phoenicians, developed, several, other, maritime, inventions, the, amphora, a, type, of, container, used, for, both, dry, and, liquid, goods, was, an, ancient, phoenician, invention, that, became, a, standardized, measurement, of, volume, for, close, to, two, thousand, years, the, remnants, of, self, cleaning, artificial, harbors, have, been, discovered, in, sidon, tyre, atlit, and, acre, the, first, example, of, admiralty, law, also, appears, in, the, levant, the, phoenicians, continued, to, contribute, to, cartography, into, the, iron, age, in, 2014, a, 12, metres, 39, ft, long, phoenician, trading, ship, was, found, near, gozo, island, in, malta, dated, 700, bc, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, wrecks, found, in, the, mediterranean, fifty, amphorae, used, to, contain, wine, and, oil, were, scattered, nearby, the, phoenicians, were, not, a, nation, in, the, political, sense, however, they, were, organized, into, independent, city, states, that, shared, a, common, language, and, culture, the, leading, city, states, were, tyre, sidon, and, byblos, rivalries, were, expected, but, armed, conflict, was, rare, numerous, other, cities, existed, in, the, levant, alone, many, probably, unknown, including, beiruta, modern, beirut, ampi, amia, arqa, baalbek, botrys, sarepta, and, tripolis, from, the, late, tenth, century, bc, the, phoenicians, established, commercial, outposts, throughout, the, mediterranean, with, tyre, founding, colonies, in, cyprus, sardinia, iberia, the, balearic, islands, sicily, malta, and, north, africa, later, colonies, were, established, beyond, the, straits, of, gibraltar, particularly, on, the, atlantic, coast, of, iberia, the, phoenicians, may, have, explored, the, canary, islands, and, the, british, isles, phoenician, settlement, was, primarily, concentrated, in, cyprus, sicily, sardinia, malta, northwest, africa, the, balearic, islands, and, southern, iberia, to, facilitate, their, commercial, ventures, the, phoenicians, established, numerous, colonies, and, trading, posts, along, the, coasts, of, the, mediterranean, phoenician, city, states, generally, lacked, the, numbers, or, even, the, desire, to, expand, their, territory, overseas, few, colonies, had, more, than, 1, 000, inhabitants, only, carthage, and, some, nearby, settlements, in, the, western, mediterranean, would, grow, larger, a, major, motivating, factor, was, competition, with, the, greeks, who, began, expanding, across, the, mediterranean, during, the, same, period, though, largely, peaceful, rivals, their, respective, settlements, in, crete, and, sicily, did, clash, intermittently, the, earliest, phoenician, settlements, outside, the, levant, were, on, cyprus, and, crete, gradually, moving, westward, towards, corsica, the, balearic, islands, sardinia, and, sicily, as, well, as, on, the, european, mainland, in, c, diz, and, m, laga, the, first, phoenician, colonies, in, the, western, mediterranean, were, along, the, northwest, african, coast, and, on, sicily, sardinia, and, the, balearic, islands, tyre, led, the, way, in, settling, or, controlling, coastal, areas, phoenician, colonies, were, fairly, autonomous, at, most, they, were, expected, to, send, annual, tribute, to, their, mother, city, usually, in, the, context, of, a, religious, offering, however, in, the, seventh, century, bc, the, western, colonies, came, under, the, control, of, carthage, which, was, exercised, directly, through, appointed, magistrates, carthage, continued, to, send, annual, tribute, to, tyre, for, some, time, after, its, independence, since, very, little, of, the, phoenicians, writings, have, survived, much, of, what, is, known, about, their, culture, and, society, comes, from, accounts, by, contemporary, civilizations, or, inferences, from, archaeological, discoveries, the, phoenicians, had, much, in, common, with, other, canaanites, including, language, religion, social, customs, and, a, monarchical, political, system, centered, around, city, states, however, by, the, early, iron, age, roughly, 1300, bc, they, had, emerged, as, distinct, people, their, culture, economy, and, daily, life, were, heavily, centered, on, commerce, and, maritime, trade, their, propensity, for, seafaring, brought, them, into, contact, with, many, other, civilizations, the, phoenician, city, states, were, highly, independent, competing, with, each, other, formal, alliances, between, city, states, were, rare, the, relative, power, and, influence, of, city, states, varied, over, time, sidon, was, dominant, between, the, 12th, and, 11th, centuries, bc, and, influenced, its, neighbors, however, by, the, tenth, century, bc, tyre, rose, to, become, the, most, powerful, city, at, least, in, its, earlier, stages, phoenician, society, was, highly, stratified, and, predominantly, monarchical, hereditary, kings, usually, governed, with, absolute, power, over, civic, commercial, and, religious, affairs, they, often, relied, upon, senior, officials, from, the, noble, and, merchant, classes, the, priesthood, was, a, distinct, class, usually, of, royal, lineage, or, leading, merchant, families, the, king, was, considered, a, representative, of, the, gods, and, carried, many, obligations, and, duties, concerning, religious, processions, and, rituals, priests, were, thus, highly, influential, and, often, became, intertwined, with, the, royal, family, phoenician, kings, did, not, commemorate, their, reign, through, sculptures, or, monuments, their, wealth, power, and, accomplishments, were, usually, conveyed, through, ornate, sarcophagi, like, that, of, ahiram, of, byblos, the, phoenicians, kept, records, of, their, rulers, in, tomb, inscriptions, which, are, among, the, few, primary, sources, still, available, historians, have, determined, a, clear, line, of, succession, over, centuries, for, some, city, states, notably, byblos, and, tyre, starting, as, early, as, 15th, century, bc, phoenician, leaders, were, advised, by, councils, or, assemblies, which, gradually, took, greater, power, in, the, sixth, century, bc, during, the, period, of, babylonian, rule, tyre, briefly, adopted, a, system, of, government, consisting, of, a, pair, of, judges, with, authority, roughly, equivalent, to, the, roman, consul, known, as, sufetes, shophets, who, were, chosen, from, the, most, powerful, noble, families, and, served, short, terms, in, the, fourth, century, bc, when, the, armies, of, alexander, the, great, approached, tyre, they, were, met, not, by, its, king, but, by, representatives, of, the, commonwealth, of, the, city, similarly, historians, at, the, time, describe, the, inhabitants, or, the, people, of, sidon, making, peace, with, alexander, when, the, macedonians, sought, to, appoint, a, new, king, over, sidon, the, citizens, nominated, their, candidate, after, the, king, and, council, the, two, most, important, political, positions, in, virtually, every, phoenician, city, state, were, governor, and, commander, of, the, army, details, regarding, the, duties, of, these, offices, are, sparse, however, it, is, known, that, the, governor, was, responsible, for, collecting, taxes, implementing, decrees, supervising, judges, and, ensuring, the, administration, of, law, and, justice, as, warfare, was, rare, among, the, most, mercantile, phoenicians, the, army, s, commander, was, generally, responsible, for, ensuring, the, defense, and, security, of, the, city, state, and, its, hinterlands, the, phoenicians, had, a, system, of, courts, and, judges, that, resolved, disputes, and, punished, crimes, based, on, a, semi, codified, body, of, laws, and, traditions, laws, were, implemented, by, the, state, and, were, the, responsibility, of, the, ruler, and, certain, designated, officials, like, other, levantine, societies, laws, were, harsh, and, biased, reflecting, the, social, stratification, of, society, the, murder, of, a, commoner, was, treated, as, less, severe, than, that, of, a, nobleman, and, the, upper, classes, had, the, most, rights, the, wealthy, often, escaped, punishment, by, paying, a, fine, free, men, of, any, class, could, represent, themselves, in, court, and, had, more, rights, than, women, and, children, while, slaves, had, no, rights, men, could, often, deflect, punishment, to, their, wives, children, or, slaves, even, having, them, serve, their, sentence, in, their, place, lawyers, eventually, emerged, as, a, profession, for, those, who, could, not, plead, their, case, as, in, neighboring, societies, at, the, time, penalties, for, crimes, were, often, severe, usually, reflecting, the, principle, of, reciprocity, for, example, the, killing, of, a, slave, would, be, punished, by, having, the, offender, s, slave, killed, imprisonment, was, rare, with, fines, exile, punishment, and, execution, the, main, remedies, as, with, most, aspects, of, phoenician, civilization, there, are, few, records, of, their, military, or, approach, to, warfare, compared, to, most, of, their, neighbors, the, phoenicians, generally, had, little, interest, in, conquest, and, were, relatively, peaceful, the, wealth, and, prosperity, of, all, their, city, states, rested, on, foreign, trade, which, required, good, relations, and, a, certain, degree, of, mutual, trust, they, also, lacked, the, territory, and, agricultural, base, to, support, a, population, large, enough, to, raise, an, army, of, conquest, instead, each, city, had, an, army, commander, in, charge, of, a, defensive, garrison, however, the, specifics, of, the, role, or, city, defense, are, unknown, the, phoenician, language, was, a, member, of, the, canaanite, branch, of, the, northwest, semitic, languages, its, descendant, language, spoken, in, the, carthaginian, empire, is, termed, punic, punic, was, still, spoken, in, the, fifth, century, ad, and, known, to, st, augustine, of, hippo, around, 1050, bc, the, phoenicians, developed, a, script, for, writing, their, own, language, the, canaanite, phoenician, alphabet, consists, of, 22, letters, all, consonants, and, is, thus, strictly, an, abjad, it, is, believed, to, be, a, continuation, of, the, proto, sinaitic, or, proto, canaanite, script, attested, in, the, sinai, and, in, canaan, in, the, late, bronze, age, through, their, maritime, trade, the, phoenicians, spread, the, use, of, the, alphabet, to, anatolia, north, africa, and, europe, the, name, phoenician, is, by, convention, given, to, inscriptions, beginning, around, 1050, bc, because, phoenician, hebrew, and, other, canaanite, dialects, were, largely, indistinguishable, before, that, time, phoenician, inscriptions, are, found, in, lebanon, syria, israel, palestine, cyprus, and, other, locations, as, late, as, the, early, centuries, of, the, christian, era, the, alphabet, was, adopted, and, modified, by, the, greeks, probably, in, the, eighth, century, bc, this, most, likely, did, not, occur, in, a, single, instance, but, the, process, of, commercial, exchange, the, legendary, phoenician, hero, cadmus, is, credited, with, bringing, the, alphabet, to, greece, however, it, is, more, plausible, that, phoenician, immigrants, brought, it, to, crete, whence, it, gradually, diffused, northwards, phoenician, art, was, largely, centered, on, ornamental, objects, particularly, jewelry, pottery, glassware, and, reliefs, large, sculptures, were, rare, figurines, were, more, common, phoenician, goods, have, been, found, from, spain, and, morocco, to, russia, and, iraq, much, of, what, is, known, about, phoenician, art, is, based, on, excavations, outside, phoenicia, proper, phoenician, art, was, highly, influenced, by, many, cultures, primarily, egypt, greece, and, assyria, greek, inspiration, was, particularly, pronounced, in, pottery, while, egyptian, styles, were, most, reflected, in, ivory, work, phoenician, art, also, differed, from, its, contemporaries, in, its, continuance, of, bronze, age, conventions, well, into, the, iron, age, such, as, terracotta, masks, phoenician, artisans, were, known, for, their, skill, with, wood, ivory, bronze, and, textiles, in, the, old, testament, a, craftsman, from, tyre, is, commissioned, to, build, and, decorate, the, legendary, solomon, s, temple, in, jerusalem, which, presupposes, a, well, developed, and, highly, respected, craft, industry, in, phoenicia, by, the, mid, tenth, century, bc, the, iliad, mentions, the, embroidered, robes, of, priam, s, wife, hecabe, as, the, work, of, sidonian, women, and, describes, a, mixing, bowl, of, chased, silver, as, a, masterpiece, of, sidonian, craftsmanship, the, assyrians, appeared, to, have, valued, phoenician, ivory, work, in, particular, collecting, vast, quantities, in, their, palaces, phoenician, art, appears, to, have, been, indelibly, tied, to, phoenician, commercial, interests, they, have, crafted, goods, to, appeal, to, particular, trading, partners, distinguishing, not, only, different, cultures, but, even, socioeconomic, status, classes, women, in, phoenicia, took, part, in, public, events, and, religious, processions, with, depictions, of, banquets, showing, them, casually, sitting, or, reclining, with, men, dancing, and, playing, music, in, most, contexts, women, were, expected, to, dress, and, behave, more, modestly, than, men, female, figures, are, almost, always, portrayed, as, clothed, from, head, to, feet, with, the, arms, sometimes, covered, as, well, although, they, rarely, had, political, power, women, took, part, in, community, affairs, including, in, the, popular, assemblies, that, emerged, in, some, city, states, at, least, one, woman, unmiashtart, is, recorded, to, have, ruled, sidon, in, the, fifth, century, bc, the, two, most, famous, phoenician, women, are, political, figures, jezebel, portrayed, in, the, bible, as, the, wicked, princess, of, sidon, and, dido, the, semi, legendary, founder, and, first, queen, of, carthage, in, virgil, s, epic, poem, the, aeneid, dido, is, described, as, having, been, the, co, ruler, of, tyre, using, cleverness, to, escape, the, tyranny, of, her, brother, pygmalion, and, to, secure, an, ideal, site, for, carthage, the, religious, practices, and, beliefs, of, phoenicia, were, generally, common, to, those, of, their, neighbors, in, canaan, which, in, turn, shared, characteristics, common, throughout, the, ancient, semitic, world, religious, rites, were, primarily, for, city, state, purposes, payment, of, taxes, by, citizens, was, considered, in, the, category, of, religious, sacrifices, the, phoenician, sacred, writings, known, to, the, ancients, have, been, lost, several, canaanite, practices, are, alleged, in, ancient, sources, and, mentioned, by, scholars, such, as, temple, prostitution, and, child, sacrifice, special, sites, known, as, tophets, were, allegedly, used, by, the, phoenicians, to, burn, their, sons, and, their, daughters, in, the, fire, and, are, condemned, by, yahweh, in, the, hebrew, bible, particularly, in, jeremiah, 7, 30, 32, and, in, 2nd, kings, 23, 10, and, 17, 17, later, scholarship, differs, william, dever, writes, that, it, is, out, of, prejudices, ancient, and, modern, that, the, myth, of, cult, prostitution, arose, he, comments, that, other, texts, in, addition, to, ii, kings, 23, 10, unhesitatingly, describe, child, sacrifice, among, the, israelites, and, points, to, i, kings, 16, 34, notwithstanding, differences, cultural, and, religious, similarities, persisted, between, the, ancient, hebrews, and, the, phoenicians, biblical, traditions, state, that, the, tribe, of, asher, lived, among, local, phoenicians, eventually, david, and, solomon, gave, phoenicia, full, political, autonomy, due, to, their, supremacy, in, shipping, and, trade, canaanite, religious, mythology, does, not, appear, as, elaborate, as, their, semitic, cousins, in, mesopotamia, in, canaan, the, supreme, god, was, called, el, god, the, son, of, el, was, baal, master, lord, a, powerful, dying, and, rising, storm, god, other, gods, were, called, by, royal, titles, such, as, melqart, meaning, king, of, the, city, or, adonis, for, lord, such, epithets, may, often, have, been, merely, local, titles, for, the, same, deities, the, semitic, pantheon, was, well, populated, which, god, became, primary, evidently, depended, on, the, exigencies, of, a, particular, city, state, melqart, was, prominent, throughout, phoenicia, and, overseas, as, was, astarte, a, fertility, goddess, with, regal, and, matronly, aspects, religious, institutions, in, tyre, called, marzeh, place, of, reunion, did, much, to, foster, social, bonding, and, kin, loyalty, marzeh, held, banquets, for, their, membership, on, festival, days, and, many, developed, into, elite, fraternities, each, marzeh, nurtured, congeniality, and, community, through, a, series, of, ritual, meals, shared, among, trusted, kin, in, honor, of, deified, ancestors, in, carthage, which, had, developed, a, complex, republican, system, of, government, the, marzeh, may, have, played, a, role, in, forging, social, and, political, ties, among, citizens, carthaginians, were, divided, into, different, institutions, that, were, solidified, through, communal, feasts, and, banquets, such, festival, groups, may, also, have, composed, the, voting, cohort, for, selecting, members, of, the, city, state, s, assembly, the, phoenicians, made, votive, offerings, to, their, gods, namely, in, the, form, of, figurines, and, pottery, vessels, hundreds, of, figurines, and, fragments, have, been, recovered, from, the, mediterranean, often, spanning, centuries, between, them, suggesting, they, were, cast, into, the, sea, to, ensure, safe, travels, since, the, phoenicians, were, predominantly, seafaring, people, it, is, speculated, that, many, of, their, rituals, were, performed, at, sea, or, aboard, ships, however, the, specific, nature, of, these, practices, is, unknown, on, land, they, were, renowned, temple, builders, perhaps, inspiring, elements, of, the, architecture, of, the, first, temple, the, temple, of, solomon, the, plan, of, the, building, the, chisel, dressed, masonry, and, the, various, decorative, motifs, are, all, clearly, of, phoenician, inspiration, as, we, now, know, 34, 07, 25, n, 35, 39,
