disarmament, conference, in, 579, and, agreed, to, declare, a, truce, to, limit, their, military, strength, this, peace, did, not, last, very, long, and, it, soon, became, apparent, that, the, b, role, had, become, outdated, the, four, major, states, had, each, acquired, their, own, spheres, of, control, and, the, notion, of, protecting, zhou, territory, had, become, less, cogent, as, the, control, over, and, the, resulting, cultural, assimilation, of, non, zhou, peoples, as, well, as, chu, s, control, of, some, zhou, areas, further, blurred, an, already, vague, distinction, between, zhou, and, non, zhou, in, addition, new, aristocratic, houses, were, founded, with, loyalties, to, powerful, states, rather, than, directly, to, the, zhou, kings, though, this, process, slowed, down, by, the, end, of, the, seventh, century, possibly, because, territory, available, for, expansion, had, been, largely, exhausted, the, zhou, kings, had, also, lost, much, of, their, prestige, so, that,
