wilderness, is, green, and, grassy, with, no, trees, nor, hills, high, or, low, there, is, no, means, of, travelling, in, this, desert, except, in, wagons, the, persian, historian, hamdallah, mustawfi, 1281, 1349, wrote, that, cumania, has, a, cold, climate, and, that, it, has, excellent, pasturage, and, numerous, cattle, and, horses, 40, the, 14th, century, travels, of, sir, john, mandeville, note, that, cumania, is, one, of, the, great, kingdoms, in, the, world, but, it, is, not, all, inhabited, for, at, one, of, the, parts, there, is, so, great, cold, that, no, man, may, dwell, there, and, in, another, part, there, is, so, great, heat, that, no, man, may, endure, it, and, the, principal, city, of, comania, is, clept, sarak, that, is, one, of, the, three, ways, for, to, go, into, india, but, by, that, way, he, may, not, pass, no, great, multitude, of, people, but, if, it, be, in, winter, and, that, passage, men, clepe, the, derbend, the, other, way, is, for, to, go, from, the, city, of, turkestan, by, persia, and, by, that, way, be, many, journeys, by, desert, and, the, third, way, is, that, cometh, from, comania, and, then, to, go, by, the, great, sea, and, by, the, kingdom, of, abchaz, after, that, the, comanians, that, were, in, servage, in, egypt, felt, themselves, that, they, were, of, great, power, they, chose, them, a, soldan, amongst, them, the, which, made, him, to, be, clept, melechsalan, and, in, his, time, entered, into, the, country, of, the, kings, of, france, saint, louis, and, fought, with, him, and, took, him, and, imprisoned, him, and, this, was, slain, by, his, own, servants, and, after, they, chose, another, to, be, soldan, that, they, clept, tympieman, and, he, let, deliver, saint, louis, out, of, prison, for, a, certain, ransom, and, after, one, of, these, comanians, reigned, that, hight, cachas, and, slew, tympieman, for, to, be, soldan, and, made, him, be, clept, melechmenes, in, east, slavic, languages, and, polish, they, are, known, as, the, polovtsy, derived, from, the, slavic, root, polv, pale, light, yellow, blonde, 43, polovtsy, or, polovec, is, often, said, to, be, derived, from, the, old, east, slavic, polov, yellow, pale, by, the, russians, all, meaning, blond, the, old, ukrainian, word, polovtsy, derived, from, polovo, straw, means, blond, pale, yellow, the, western, cumans, or, polovtsy, were, also, called, sorochinetses, by, the, rus, apparently, derived, from, the, turkic, sary, chechle, yellow, haired, a, similar, etymology, may, have, been, at, work, in, the, name, of, the, r, who, also, migrated, westward, ahead, of, the, qun, however, according, to, o, suleymenov, polovtsy, may, come, from, a, slavic, word, for, blue, eyed, i, e, the, serbo, croatian, pl, v, means, blue, but, this, word, also, means, fair, blonde, and, is, a, cognate, of, the, above, cf, west, slavic, polish, p, owy, eastern, slavic, polov, russian, pol, vyj, ukrainian, polov, j, blonde, individuals, likely, existed, among, the, kipchaks, yet, anthropologically, speaking, the, majority, of, turkic, peoples, had, east, asian, admixture, and, generally, kimeks, kipchaks, were, dark, haired, and, brown, eyed, an, alternative, etymology, of, polovtsy, is, also, possible, the, slavic, root, p, lje, field, cf, polish, russian, pole, which, would, therefore, imply, that, polovtsy, were, men, of, the, field, or, men, of, the, steppe, in, contrast, to, the, lipovtsi, in, germanic, languages, the, cumans, were, called, folban, vallani, or, valwe, all, derivatives, of, proto, germanic, root, falwa, meaning, pale, 106, english, fallow, in, the, german, account, by, adam, of, bremen, and, in, matthaios, of, edessa, the, cumans, were, referred, to, as, the, blond, ones, as, stated, above, it, is, unknown, whether, the, name, kipchak, referred, only, to, the, kipchaks, proper, or, to, the, cumans, as, well, the, two, tribes, eventually, fused, lived, together, and, probably, exchanged, weaponry, culture, and, languages, the, cumans, encompassed, the, western, half, of, the, confederation, while, the, kipchaks, and, presumably, the, kangli, kankalis, possibly, connected, to, three, pecheneg, tribes, known, collectively, as, kangars, encompassed, the, eastern, half, this, confederation, and, their, living, together, may, have, made, it, difficult, for, historians, to, write, exclusively, about, either, nation, 6, the, kipchaks, folk, etymology, posited, that, their, name, meant, hollow, tree, according, to, them, inside, a, hollow, tree, their, original, human,

etymology, remain, a, matter, of, contention, and, speculation, kievan, rus, mamluk, hungarian, and, chinese, sources, preserved, the, names, of, many, cuman, kupchak, tribal, groupings, seven, cuman, tribes, eventually, settled, in, hungary, namely, 280, 511, baskakov, thought, that, the, moguty, tatrany, revugy, shel, biry, and, topchaki, belonged, to, the, chorni, klobuky, the, original, homeland, of, the, cumans, is, unknown, before, their, eventual, settlement, in, the, eurasian, steppe, s, western, part, chinese, authors, mentioned, a, tiele, tribe, named, mand, h, n, mc, uon, possibly, a, transcription, of, underlying, qun, located, north, of, the, tuul, river, the, writings, of, al, marwazi, c, 1120, state, that, a, turkic, qun, people, came, from, the, northern, chinese, borders, the, land, of, qitay, possibly, during, a, part, of, a, migration, from, further, east, after, leaving, the, lands, of, the, khitans, possibly, due, to, the, khitans, expansion, 199, the, qun, entered, the, territory, of, the, ari, people, whom, the, quns, expelled, marwazi, wrote, that, the, qun, were, nestorian, christians, 4, 5, golden, surmised, that, these, quns, might, have, sprung, from, that, same, conglomeration, of, mongolic, peoples, from, which, the, qita, sprang, however, golden, later, suggested, that, the, quns, were, turkic, despite, this, it, is, possible, that, certain, tribes, forming, a, part, of, the, cuman, kipchak, conglomerate, were, of, mongolic, origin, golden, considers, the, lberli, to, have, originally, been, mongolic, speaking, and, argues, that, they, were, pushed, westwards, as, a, result, of, socio, political, changes, among, the, khitans, the, syrian, historian, yaqut, 1179, 1229, also, mentions, the, qun, in, the, dictionary, of, countries, where, he, notes, that, the, sixth, iqlim, begins, where, the, meridian, shadow, of, the, equinox, is, seven, six, tenths, and, one, sixth, of, one, tenth, of, a, foot, its, end, exceeds,

279, the, armenian, historian, matthew, of, edessa, died, 1144, also, mentioned, the, cumans, using, the, name, arte, meaning, blond, pale, fair, 173, it, cannot, be, established, whether, the, cumans, conquered, the, kipchaks, if, the, ari, whom, the, quns, had, defeated, were, to, be, identified, as, kipchaks, or, whether, they, simply, represent, the, western, mass, of, largely, kipchak, turkic, speaking, tribes, the, quns, and, ari, whom, czegl, dy, 1949, 47, 48, 50, identifies, with, yellow, uyghurs, were, possibly, induced, into, the, kimek, union, or, took, over, said, union, and, absorbed, the, kimek, as, a, result, the, kipchaks, presumably, replaced, the, kimeks, as, the, union, s, dominant, group, while, the, quns, gained, ascendancy, over, the, westernmost, tribes, and, became, quman, though, difficulties, remain, with, the, qun, cuman, link, and, how, qun, became, cuman, e, g, qun, man, the, real, quns, qumman, quman, kimeks, were, still, represented, amongst, the, cuman, kipchaks, as, yimek, yemek, potapov, writes, that, during, the, period, from, the, end, of, the, 800s, to, 1230, ad, spread, their, political, influence, in, the, broad, steppes, from, altai,

to, the, west, of, the, dnieper, river, 186, cuman, and, rus, attacks, contributed, to, the, departure, of, the, oghuz, from, the, steppes, north, of, the, black, sea, 114, mahmud, al, kashgari,

from, the, danube, in, the, west, to, taraz, kazakhstan, in, the, east, 283, this, was, possibly, due, to, their, facing, no, prolonged, threat, before, the, mongol, invasion, and, it, may, have,

in, 1239, one, branch, of, the, cumans, migrated, to, the, balkans, and, another, branch, went, down, to, the, anatolia, they, later, came, into, contact, with, georgians, hungarians, and, turks, the, architect, of, the, georgian, cuman, relations, was, the, david, iv, of, georgia, this, event, which, was, one, of, the, most, important, military, reforms, of, david, s, against, the, seljuk, invaders, took, place, when, a, high, level, georgian, delegation, visited, the, cuman, headquarters, to, strengthen, this, alliance, with, the, nomads, david, married, with, cuman, king, atrak, s, daughter, guranduht, and, invited, her, relatives, to, settle, in, georgia, david, brokered, a, truce, between, the, kipchaks, and, alans, later, on, he, has, held, some, consultations, with, vladimir, ii, monomakh, grand, duke, of, kiev, who, defeated, atrak, in, 1109, to, ensure, free, passage, of, nomadic, tribes, into, georgia, king, andrew, ii, of, hungary, granted, the, burzenland, region, to, the, teutonic, knights, in, 1211, with, the, purpose, of, ensuring, security, of, the, southeastern, borders, of, his, kingdom, against, the, cumans, the, teutonic, knights, campaigned, against, the, cumans, on, behalf, of, king, andrew, during, the, years, of, 1221, 1225, however, the, teutonic, knights, failed, to, defeat, the, cumans, and, began, to, establish, a, country, independent, of, the, king, of, hungary, in, 1238, after, mongol, attacks, on, cumania, king, b, la, iv, of, hungary, offered, refuge, to, the, remainder, of, the, cuman, people, under, their, leader, khan, k, ten, who, in, turn, vowed, to, convert, his, 40, 000, families, to, christianity, king, b, la, hoped, to, use, the, new, subjects, as, auxiliary, troops, against, the, mongols, who, were, already, threatening, hungary, the, cumans, were, joined, by, the, iranian, jasz, people, who, had, been, living, with, the, cumans, 44, batu, khan, of, the, mongols, then, ordered, bela, to, stop, giving, refuge, to, the, cumans, and, made, a, particular, point, that, if, attacked, the, cumans, could, easily, run, away, for, they, were, skilled, horseman, but, not, so, for, the, hungarians, who, were, a, sedentary, nation, and, had, no, such, luxury, bela, rejected, this, ultimatum, around, december, 1240, news, came, that, the, mongols, were, advancing, towards, hungary, king, bela, then, installed, front, line, defenses, at, the, carpathian, mountains, after, which, he, returned, to, buda, and, called, a, council, of, war, and, ordered, unity, against, the, mongols, the, opposite, happened, however, as, many, of, the, barons, were, hostile, towards, the, cumans, the, hungarian, barons, noted, that, there, were, cumans, in, the, mongol, armies, but, they, did, not, realize, that, this, was, because, they, were, conscripted, into, it, and, had, no, say, in, the, matter, in, particular, the, barons, did, not, trust, k, ten, despite, the, fact, that, the, mongols, had, attacked, his, people, for, nearly, 20, years, this, chaos, pushed, bela, into, a, corner, feeling, he, needed, to, show, his, strength, and, keep, the, rebellious, barons, on, his, side, he, ordered, k, ten, to, be, placed, under, house, arrest, this, did, not, placate, the, barons, and, had, an, opposite, effect, of, erroneously, seeming, to, admit, that, the, king, harboured, doubts, about, k, ten, too, this, angered, the, cumans, who, were, far, from, happy, about, the, actions, taken, against, them, and, who, had, done, nothing, to, invite, such, actions, and, hated, the, mongols, news, arrived, on, 10, march, that, the, mongols, had, attacked, the, hungarian, defenses, at, the, carpathian, passes, this, prompted, bela, to, send, a, letter, to, duke, frederick, of, austria, asking, for, help, frederick, had, previously, wanted, bela, s, throne, but, bela, responded, by, amassing, a, vast, army, and, marching, to, the, gates, of, vienna, which, forced, frederick, to, step, back, on, 14, march, news, had, arrived, that, the, carpathian, defense, forces, were, defeated, by, the, mongols, ironically, given, the, suspicion, of, the, cumans, they, were, the, only, ones, who, seemed, willing, to, fight, the, mongols, the, memory, of, the, fate, that, had, befallen, them, on, the, steppes, still, being, fresh, in, their, minds, by, this, time, bela, had, lost, control, of, his, army, and, many, towns, were, destroyed, soon, thereafter, frederick, arrived, and, wishing, to, harm, the, country, s, defense, in, revenge, to, bela, he, stirred, up, further, feelings, against, the, cumans, after, crushing, defeats, and, facing, complete, collapse, the, hungarians, engaged, in, a, suicidal, betrayal, of, the, cumans, the, people, that, had, done, the, most, in, repelling, the, mongols, some, of, the, barons, went, to, k, ten, s, house, with, the, intent, of, killing, him, as, scapegoat, or, handing, him, over, to, the, mongols, possibly, believing, the, cuman, kipchaks, were, mongol, spies, however, the, barons, had, k, ten, assassinated, in, pest, on, 17, march, 1241, when, news, of, this, outrage, reached, the, cuman, camp, there, was, an, eruption, of, vesuvian, intensity, in, revenge, for, this, victimization, they, slaughtered, a, vast, number, of, hungarians, 117, 22, the, cumans, then, left, for, the, balkans, and, the, second, bulgarian, empire, going, on, a, rampage, of, destruction, through, hungary, equal, to, that, which, europe, had, not, experienced, since, the, incursions, of, the, mongols, 37, with, this, departure, of, its, only, ally, and, most, efficient, and, reliable, military, force, 43, hungary, was, now, further, weakened, to, attack, and, a, month, later, it, was, destroyed, by, the, mongols, 186, 173, after, the, invasion, king, b, la, iv, now, penniless, and, humiliated, after, the, confiscation, of, his, treasury, and, loss, of, three, of, his, border, areas, begged, the, cumans, to, return, to, hungary, and, help, rebuild, the, country, in, return, for, their, military, service, b, la, invited, the, cumans, to, settle, in, areas, of, the, great, plain, between, the, danube, and, the, tisza, rivers, this, region, had, become, almost, uninhabited, after, the, mongol, raids, of, 1241, 1242, the, cuman, tribes, subsequently, settled, throughout, the, great, hungarian, plain, creating, two, regions, incorporating, the, name, cumania, kuns, g, in, hungarian, greater, cumania, nagykuns, g, and, little, cumania, kiskuns, g, six, of, these, tribes, were, the, borchol, borscol, who, settled,

olas, who, settled, in, greater, cumania, iloncsuk, who, settled, in, little, cumania, kor, who, settled, in, the, county, of, csanad, and, the, sixth, being, possibly, koncsog, 44, 174, as, the, cumans, came, into, the, kingdom, the, hungarian, nobility, suspected, that, the, king, intended, to, use, the, cumans, to, strengthen, his, royal, power, at, their, expense, 80, during, the, following, centuries, the, cumans, in, hungary, were, granted, rights, and, privileges, the, extent, of, which, depended, on, the, prevailing, political, situation, some, of, these, rights, survived, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, although, the, cumans, had, long, since, assimilated, with, hungarians, the, cumans, were, different, in, every, way, to, the, local, population, of, hungary, their, appearance, attire, and, hairstyle, set, them, apart, in, 1270, elizabeth, the, cuman, the, daughter, of, a, cuman, chieftain, seyhan, 99, became, queen, of, hungary, elizabeth, ruled, during,

imprisonment, by, the, rebels, but, supporters, freed, her, in, 1274, during, her, reign, gifts, of, precious, clothes, land, and, other, objects, were, given, to, the, cumans, with, the, intent, to, ensure, their, continued, support, and, in, particular, during, the, civil, war, between, king, b, la, iv, and, stephen, v, of, hungary, when, both, sides, tried, to, gain, cuman, support, during, this, conflict, in, 1264, b, la, sent, cuman, troops, commanded, by, the, chieftain, menk, to, fight, his, son, stephen, 82, 55, elizabeth, married, stephen, v, they, were, parents, of, six, children,

cumanorum, and, became, the, cumans, highest, judge, after, his, enthronement, the, cumans, came, directly, under, the, power, of, the, king, of, hungary, and, the, title, of, dominus, cumanorum, judge, of, the, cumans, had, passed, to, the, count, palatine, who, was, the, highest, official, after, the, king, the, cumans, had, their, own, representatives, and, were, exempt, from, the, jurisdiction, of, county, officials, 82, by, the, 15th, century, the, cumans, were, permanently, settled, in, hungary, in, villages, whose, structure, corresponded, to, that, of, the, local, population, and, they, were, christianized, the, cumans, did, not, always, ally, with, the, hungarian, kings, they, assassinated, ladislaus, iv, however, other, sources, suggest, that, certain, hungarian, barons, had, a, role, in, his, murder, thus, ladislaus, fell, victim, to, his, political, enemies, 82, the, royal, and, ecclesiastical, authorities, incorporated, rather, than, excluded,

between, the, cumans, and, pechenegs, which, resulted, in, a, breach, between, the, two, peoples, this, contributed, to, the, cumans, led, by, togortok, tugorkan, and, boniak, who, had, repeatedly, raided, kievan, rus, joining, alexios, i, komnenos, against, the, pechenegs, in, the, battle, of, levounion, 120, a, couple, of, weeks, afterwards, the, cumans, invaded, the, balkans, after, the,

of, the, nicaean, empire, this, continued, until, 1242, when, nicaean, emperor, john, iii, doukas, vatatzes, in, response, to, the, situation, won, their, favour, with, gifts, and, diplomacy, thereafter, he, succeeded, in, settling, most, of, them, in, anatolia, throughout, the, meander, valley, and, the, region, east, of, philadelphia, most, of, these, cumans, enrolled, in, the, army, and, soon, afterwards, were, baptized, vatatzes, policy, towards, the, cumans, was, distinguished, by, its, enormous, scale, and, relatively, successful, outcome, cumans, had, served, as, mercenaries, in, the, armies, of, the, byzantine, empire, since, the, reign, of, alexios, i, komnenos, 1081, 1118, and, were, one, of, the, most, important, elements, of, the, byzantine, army, until, the, mid, 14th, century, they, served, as, light, cavalry, horse, archers, and, as, standing, troops, those, in, the, central, army, were, collectively, called, skythikoi, skythikon, other, cumans, lived, a, more, dangerous, life, as, highlanders, on, the, fringes, of, the, empire, possibly, being, involved, in, a, mixture, of, agriculture, and, transhumance, acting, as, a, buffer, between, nicaean, farmers, and, turkic, nomads, these, cumans, were, frequently, mustered, for, byzantine, campaigns, in, europe, in, 1242, they, were, employed, by, vatatzes, in, his, siege, of, thessaloniki, in,

in, contrast, to, their, light, cavalry, counterparts, cuman, standing, troops, appear, as, a, distinct, group, only, once, albeit, very, significantly, during, the, election, of, emperor, michael, viii, palaiologos, to, the, regency, in, 1258, after, the, consultation, of, latin, mercenaries, the, cumans, present, at, the, court, offered, their, opinion, on, the, matter, in, good, greek, this, is, indicative, of, the, cumans, spending, considerable, time, in, the, company, of, greek, speakers, the, importance, of, this, cuman, group, came, from, its, tendency, to, foster, assimilation, hellenization, and, through, time, the, social, advancement, of, its, members, an, example, of, this, influential, group, was, sytzigan, known, as, syrgiannes, after, baptism, who, before, 1290,

and, the, javelin, curved, sword, a, sabre, less, curved, than, a, scimitar, mace, and, heavy, spear, for, lancing, due, to, european, influence, some, of, the, later, period, cumans, wielded, war,

light, cavalry, archers, facing, and, shooting, to, the, rear, of, the, horse, then, a, feigned, retreat, and, skilled, ambush, to, maintain, this, tactic, to, optimum, efficiency, the, cumans, kept, a, large, number, of, reserve, horses, 10, 12, remounts, to, replace, fatigued, ones, so, that, a, fresh, horse, was, available, at, all, times, the, horsemen, used, oval, shaped, stirrups, and, employed, a, large, bridle, for, their, horses, another, important, accessory, was, a, small, whip, attached, to, the, rider, s, wrist, tribal, banners, were, either, made, of, cloth, with, tribal, emblems, or, dyed, horse, hair, with, more, tails, signifying, greater, importance, of, the, warrior, or, group, some, of, the, cumans, who, moved, west, were, influenced, by, western, heraldry, and, they, eventually, displayed, hybridized, european, cuman, heraldry, niketas, choniates, while, describing, a, battle, of, beroia, in, the, late, 12th, century, gave, an, interesting, description, of, the, nomadic, battle, techniques, of, the, cumans, they, fought, in, their, habitual, manner, learnt, from, their, fathers, they, would, attack, shoot, their, arrows, and, begin, to, fight, with, spears, before, long, they, would, turn, their, attack, into, flight, and, induce, their, enemy, to, pursue, them, then, they, would, show, their, faces, instead, of, their, backs, like, birds, cutting, through, the, air, and, would, fight, face, to, face, with, their, assailants, and, struggle, even, more, bravely, this, they, would, do, several, times, and, when, they, gained, the, upper, hand, over, the, romans, they, would, stop, turning, back, again, then, they, would, draw, their, swords, release, an, appalling, roar, and, fall, upon, the, romans, quicker, than, a, thought, they, would, seize, and, massacre, those, who, fought, bravely, and, those, who, behaved, cowardly, alike, 55, 56, robert, de, clari, gave, another, description, each, one, has, at, least, ten, or, twelve, horses, and, they, have, them, so, well, trained, that, they, follow, them, wherever, they, want, to, take, them, and, they, mount, first, on, one, and, then, on, another, when, they, are, on, a, raid, each, horse, has, a, bag, hung, on, his, nose, in, which, his, fodder, is, put, and, he, feeds, as, he, follows, his, master, and, they, do, not, stop, going, by, night, or, by, day, and, they, ride, so, hard, that, they, cover, in, one, day, and, one, night, fully, six, days, journey, or, seven, or, eight, and, while, they, are, on, the, way, they, will, not, seize, anything, or, carry, it, along, before, their, return, but, when, they, are, returning, then, they, seize, plunder, and, make, captives, and, take, anything, they, can, get, nor, do, they, go, armed, except, that, they, wear, a, garment, of, sheepskin, and, carry, bows, and, arrows, 200, the, cuman, people, practiced, the, shamanistic, religion, of, tengrism, their, belief, system, had, animistic, and, shamanistic, elements, they, celebrated, their, ancestors, and, provided, the, dead, with, objects, whose, lavishness, was, considered, an, indicator, to, the, recipient, s, social, rank, the, cumans, referred, to, their, shamans, as, kam, female, kam, katun, their, activities, were, referred, to, as, qamlyqet, meaning, to, prophesy, the, cumans, used, iranian, words, to, designate, certain, concepts,

form, of, a, bird, funerals, for, important, members, involved, firstly, creating, a, mound, then, placing, the, dead, inside, along, with, various, items, deemed, useful, in, the, afterlife, a, horse, like, the, bulgars, and, sometimes, a, servant, or, slave, cuman, divination, practices, used, animals, especially, the, wolf, and, dog, the, dog, it, kopec, was, sacred, to, the, cuman, kipchaks, to, the, extent, that, an, individual, tribe, or, clan, would, be, named, after, the, dog, or, type, of, dog, cumans, had, shamans, who, communicated, with, the, spirit, world, they, were, consulted, for, questions, of, outcomes, the, cumans, in, christian, territories, were, baptized, in, 1227, by, robert, archbishop, of, esztergom, in, a, mass, baptism, in, moldavia, on, the, orders, of, bortz, khan, who, swore, allegiance, to, king, andrew, ii, of, hungary, 48, the, codex, cumanicus, which, was, written, by, italian, merchants, and, german, missionaries, between, 1294, and, 1356, 173, was, a, linguistic, manual, for, the, turkic, cuman, language, of, the, middle, ages, designed, to, help, catholic, missionaries, communicate, with, the, cumans, it, consisted, of, a, latin, persian, cuman, glossary, grammar, observations, lists, of, consumer, goods, and, cuman, riddles, 176, the, first, copy, was, written, in, the, monastery, of, st, john, near, saray, a, later, copy, 1330, 1340, is, thought, to, have, been, written, in, a, franciscan, friary, later, different, sections, of, the, codex, such, as, the, interpreter, s, book, which, was, for, commercial, merchant, use, and, the, missionaries, book, which, contains, sermons, psalms, and, other, religious, texts, along, with, cuman, riddles, were, combined, the, interpreter, s, book, consists, of, 110, pages,

and, some, italian, verses, the, cuman, riddles, are, the, oldest, documented, material, of, turkic, riddles, and, constitute, turkic, folklore, some, of, the, riddles, have, almost, identical, modern, equivalents, for, example, kazakh, the, codex, cumanicus, is, composed, of, several, cuman, kipchak, dialects, the, cumans, language, was, a, form, of, kipchak, turkic, and, was, until, the, 14th, century, a, lingua, franca, over, much, of, the, eurasian, steppes, a, number, of, cuman, kipchak, arabic, grammar, glossaries, appeared, in, mamluk, lands, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, it, is, supposed, that, the, cumans, had, their, own, writing, system, mentioned, by, the, historian, gy, rf, s, which, could, have, been, a, runic, script, the, supposition, that, the, cumans, had, a, runic, script, is, also, suggested, by, the, academic, hakan, aydemir, who, mentioned, a, buckle, with, runic, writing, from, a, cuman, grave, 176, there, was, also, some, khazar, jewish, linguistic, influence, upon, the, cumans, the, cuman, words, shabat, and, shabat, kun, meaning, saturday, are, related, to, the, hebrew, word, shabbat, meaning, sabbath, these, hebrew, influences, in, the, language, may, have, resulted, from, contact, or, intermarriage, between, khazars, and, some, of, the, cumans, in, the, mid, 11th, century, the, looks, of, a, typical, cuman, are, a, matter, of, debate, this, is, because, in, spite, of, their, eastern, origins, several, sources, point, at, them, being, white, blue, eyed, and, blond, it, is, important, to, elaborate, however, that, the, full, range, of, available, data, sketches, a, more, complex, picture, while, the, written, sources, predominantly, emphasize, a, fair, complexion, e, g, adam, of, bremen, referring, to, them, as, the, blond, ones, the, craniometric, and, genetic, data, as, well, as, contemporary, art, support, the, image, of, a, people, highly, heterogenous, in, appearance, skulls, with, east, asian, features, are, often, found, in, burials, associated, with, the, cumans, and, pechenegs, in, europe, the, genetic, material, is, mixed, albeit, that, european, matrilineal, dna, predominates, see, also, below, unlike, the, written, sources, paintings, and, miniatures, from, between, the, 12th, and, 14th, century, close, in, time, to, the, settlement, of, cumans, to, central, europe, tend, to, support, the, picture, of, a, mixed, population, that, is, suggested, by, the, craniometric, and, genetic, analyses, in, the, anjou, legendarium, cumans, are, depicted, with, east, asian, features, and, dark, hair, while, a, fresco, in, the, kraskovo, church, in, slovakia, confirms, the, stereotype, of, the, blond, cuman, there, are, also, depictions, of, cumans, with, caucasian, features, but, dark, complexion, e, g, in, the, k, pes, kr, nika, pictum, notably, all, of, these, phenotypes, can, be, traced, to, groups, described, in, chinese, and, arab, sources, that, are, assumed, to, have, later, merged, in, the, cuman, kipchak, confederation, fair, complexion, e, g, red, hair, and, blue, or, green, eyes, were, already, noted, by, the, chinese, among, the, qincha, kipchak, while, the, tiele, to, whom, the, qun, belonged, were, not, described, as, foreign, looking, i, e, they, were, likely, east, asian, in, appearance, a, dark, complexion, was, attributed, to, the, pechenegs, by, ibn, fadlan, who, did, not, specify, however, if, their, features, are, european, or, asian, the, kipchak, qun, and, pechenegs, all, assimilated, into, the, cuman, kipchak, confederation, eventually, as, the, cumans, ceased, to, have, a, state, of, their, own, they, were, gradually, absorbed, into, eurasian, populations, certain, families, in, hungary, bulgaria, north, macedonia, turkey, romania, georgia, kazakhstan, tatars, in, crimea, the, cumans, in, dobruja, were, assimilated, into, bulgarian, and, romanian, people, 176, traces, of, the, cumans, can, still, be, found, in, placenames, stretching, from, china, to, the, balkans, such, as, some, famous, crimean, tatar, historians, such, as, halil, inalcik, and, ilber, ortayli, refused, to, use, the, term, tatar, crimean, tatars, are, direct, descendants, of, cumans, who, were, settled, in, pontic, steppes, before, the, tatar, migration, historically, cuman, language, is, considered, the, direct, ancestor, of, the, current, language, of, the, crimean, tatars, with, possible, incorporations, of, the, other, languages, like, crimean, gothic, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, the, main, prerequisites, that, led, to, the, formation, of, an, independent, crimean, tatar, ethnic, group, were, created, the, political, dominance, of, the, crimean, khanate, was, established, in, crimea, the, turkic, languages, cuman, kipchak, on, the, territory, of, the, khanate, became, dominant, and, islam, acquired, the, status, of, a, state, religion, throughout, the, peninsula, by, a, preponderance, cumanian, population, of, the, crimea, acquired, the, name, tatars, the, islamic, religion, and, turkic, language, and, the, process, of, consolidating, the, multi, ethnic, conglomerate, of, the, peninsula, began, which, has, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, crimean, tatar, people, over, several, centuries, on, the, basis, of, cuman, language, with, a, noticeable, oghuz, influence, the, crimean, tatar, language, has, developed, the, flower, kumoniga, melilot, is, also, a, relic, of, the, cumans, the, gagauz, people, are, believed, by, some, historians, to, be, descendants, of, the, cumans, the, name, qipcakli, occurs, as, a, modern, gagauz, surname, 47, the, etymology, of, the, sea, of, azov, is, popularly, said, to, derive, from, a, certain, cuman, prince, named, azum, or, asuf, who, was, killed, defending, a, town, in, this, region, in, 1067, as, the, mongols, pushed, westward, and, devastated, their, state, most, of, the, cumans, fled, to, hungary, as, well, as, the, second, bulgarian, empire, since, they, were, major, military, allies, the, cuman, participation, in, the, creation, of, the, second, bulgarian, empire, in, 1185, and, thereafter, brought, about, basic, changes, in, the, political, and, ethnic, sphere, of, bulgaria, and, the, balkans, bulgarian, tsar, ivan, asen, ii, was, descended, from, cumans, and, settled, them, in, the, southern, parts, of, the, country, bordering, the, latin, empire, and, the, despotate, of, thessalonica, those, territories, are, in, present, day, turkish, europe, bulgaria, and, north, macedonia, the, cumans, who, settled, in, hungary, had, their, own, self, government, in, a, territory, that, bore, their, name, kuns, g, that, survived, until, the, 19th, century, two, regions, little, cumania, and, greater, cumania, exist, in, hungary, the, name, of, the, cumans, kun, is, preserved, in, county, names, b, cs, kiskun, and, j, sz, nagykun, szolnok, and, several, municipalities, such, as, kunbaja, or, kunhegyes, the, cumans, were, organized, into, four, tribes, in, hungary, kolbasz, olas, in, upper, cumania, around, karcag, and, the, other, three, in, lower, cumania, the, cuman, language, disappeared, from, hungary, in, the, 17th, or, 18th, century, possibly, following, the, turkish, occupation, the, last, person, who, was, able, to, speak, some, cumanian, on, a, decaying, level, was, istv, n, varr, from, karcag, who, died, in, 1770, during, the, 1740s, when, cuman, was, no, longer, spoken, a, cuman, version, of, the, lord, s, prayer, suddenly, surfaced, it, was, taught, in, schools, in, greater, cumania, and, little, cumania, until, the, mid, 20th, century, in, turn, becoming, a, cornerstone, of, cuman, identity, in, the, 20th, century, enthusiastic, self, styled, cumans, collected, cuman, folklore, which, consisted, of, elements, such, as, a, traditional, cuman, dance, cuman, characteristics, such, as, pride, and, staunch, calvinism, by, religion, as, may, be, seen, by, figures, for, religion, in, hungary, the, kiskuns, g, is, almost, entirely, roman, catholic, whereas, in, nagykuns, g, protestants, do, outnumber, catholics, but, only, narrowly, this, ethnic, consciousness, was, linked, to, the, legal, privileges, attached, to, the, cumans, territory, 265, their, 19th, century, biographer, gy, rf, s, istv, n, in, 1870, was, of, the, opinion, that, they, originally, spoke, hungarian, together, with, the, iazyges, population, despite, this, mistake, he, has, the, best, overview, on, the, subject, concerning, details, of, material, used, cuman, influence, is, also, present, in, the, modern, hungarian, language, in, the, form, of, loanwords, particularly, in, the, areas, of, horse, breeding, eating, hunting, and, fighting, 265, in, 1918, after, world, war, i, the, cuman, national, council, was, formed, in, hungary, which, was, an, attempt, to, separate, the, kuns, g, region, greater, cumania, and, little, cumania, from, the, hungarian, state, with, the, aim, of, forming, a, new, independent, cuman, state, in, europe, the, cuman, national, council, declared, the, independence, of, kuns, g, and, elected, its, president, count, gedeon, r, day, on, 18, december, however, the, council, s, efforts, remained, unsuccessful, in, 1939, cuman, descendants, organized, celebrations, for, the, 700th, anniversary, of, their, arrival, in, hungary, where, they, emphasized, their, separate, ethnic, existence, and, identity, with, ceremonial, speeches, in, 1995, the, cuman, memorial, site, was, inaugurated, as, a, tribute, to, the, cuman, ancestors, and, the, redemption, of, the, former, nagykun, district, in, 2009, and, subsequently, 2012, a, world, meeting, of, the, cumans, was, held, in, karcag, during, the, first, meeting, which, lasted, two, weeks, academic, conferences, historical, exhibitions, publications, presentations, of, traditional, and, cultural, festivals, and, lectures, in, relation, to, the, cumans, were, held, in, the, 2012, meeting, the, minister, for, rural, development, s, ndor, fazekas, mentioned, how, cuman, traditions, are, still, kept, alive, such, as, costumes, folk, songs, and, food, toponyms, of, the, cuman, language, origin, can, be, found, in, some, romanian, counties, of, gala, i, teleorman, and, vaslui, including, the, names, of, those, three, counties, for, gala, i, debatable, when, some, of, the, cumans, moved, to, hungary, they, brought, with, them, their, komondor, dogs, the, komondor, breed, has, been, declared, one, of, hungary, s, national, treasures, to, be, preserved, and, protected, from, modification, the, name, komondor, derives, from, koman, dor, meaning, cuman, dog, in, the, countries, where, the, cumans, were, assimilated, family, surnames, derived, from, the, words, for, cuman, such, as, coman, or, kun, kuman, are, not, uncommon, traces, of, the, cumans, are, the, bulgarian, surnames, kunev, or, kumanov, feminine, kuneva, kumanova, and, asenov, its, variants, in, north, macedonia, kunevski, kumanovski, feminine, kumanovska, the, kazakh, surname, kumanov, the, widespread, hungarian, surname, kun, the, hungarian, surnames, of, csertan, csoreg, kokscor, karacs, kekcse, the, hungarian, surname, of, kangur, a, byname, of, one, of, the, families, of, karcag, the, words, kangur, and, karcag, derive, from, qongur, and, qarsaq, respectively, and, occur, as, modern, day, clan, names, of, the, kazakhs, the, kipchak, tribes, qongur, and, qarsaq, as, well, as, names, used, by, the, kirgyz, in, the, manas, epic, mentioned, as, kongur, bay, lord, of, the, mongol, kalmyk, people, and, the, warrior, kongrolu, the, hungarian, surname, of, kapscog, from, kipchak, kapsog, tojasos, kovacs, a, byname, of, kovacs, family, as, well, as, the, name, of, eszenyi, kopscog, of, hungary, and, the, greek, surname, asan, 40, 54, the, names, coman, in, romania, and, its, derivatives, however, do, not, appear, to, have, any, connection, to, the, medieval, cumans, as, it, was, unrecorded, until, very, recent, times, and, the, places, with, the, highest, frequency, of, such, names, has, not, produced, any, archaeological, evidence, of, cuman, settlement, over, time, cuman, culture, exerted, an, influence, on, the, ceang, i, hungarian, csangos, and, romanian, culture, in, moldavia, due, to, the, hungarians, in, moldavia, socializing, and, mingling, with, the, cumans, between, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, hakan, aydemir, a, turkic, linguist, states, that, the, ir, of, the, ceang, i, csangos, and, sz, kelys, dialect, which, means, carve, notch, as, well, as, the, words, urk, uruk, meaning, lasso, noose, dszepu, meaning, wool, and, korhany, meaning, small, mountain, hill, are, of, cuman, kipchak, origin, additionally, the, cumans, could, have, also, had, some, connection, with, sz, kelys, runes, several, romanian, as, well, as, hungarian, academics, believe, that, a, significant, cuman, population, lived, in, moldavia, in, the, 15th, century, these, cumans, later, assimilated, into, the, romanian, population, people, in, hungary, with, the, surname, pal, c, are, descended, from, the, cumans, and, possibly, kabars, and, pechenegs, pal, c, origintates, from, the, slavic, word, polovets, polovtsy, although, the, pal, cs, were, similar, to, the, hungarians, in, origins, and, culture, they, were, considered, distinct, groups, by, the, turks, the, first, written, record, of, the, word, pal, c, as, the, name, of, a, people, appears, in, the, mez, k, vesd, register, in, 1784, some, scholars, believe, there, is, also, no, connection, between, the, cumans, and, the, dutch, surnames, kooman, s, koman, s, koeman, s, de, cooman, s, and, coman, s, used, particularly, in, the, flemish, area, and, the, dutch, county, of, zeeland, they, believe, these, surnames, are, medieval, and, were, used, in, the, meaning, of, merchant, however, other, scholars, believe, the, coumans, surname, found, in, the, low, countries, and, france, has, its, origins, in, the, cumans, the, cumans, appear, in, rus, culture, in, the, rus, epic, poem, the, tale, of, igor, s, campaign, and, are, the, military, enemies, of, the, rus, in, alexander, borodin, s, opera, prince, igor, which, features, a, set, of, polovtsian, dances, the, name, cuman, is, the, name, of, several, villages, in, turkey, such, as, kumanlar, including, the, black, sea, region, the, indigenous, people, in, the, altai, republic, kumandins, kumandy, are, descended, from, the, cumans, by, the, 17th, century, the, kumandins, lived, along, the, river, charysh, near, its, confluence, with, the, river, ob, a, subsequent, relocation, to, the, altai, was, driven, by, their, unwillingness, to, pay, yasak, financial, tribute, to, the, russian, sovereign, n, aristov, linked, the, kumandins, and, the, chelkans, to, the, ancient, turks, who, in, the, 6th, 8th, century, ad, created, in, central, asia, a, powerful, nomadic, state, which, received, the, name, turkic, kaganate, persons, of, cuman, kipchak, origin, also, became, mamluk, leaders, a, prominent, cuman, sultan, of, the, egyptian, mamluk, sultanate, sultan, baibars, reigned, 1260, 1277, defeated, king, louis, ix, of, france, and, resisted, the, mongol, invasion, defeating, the, mongol, army, at, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, 1260, and, the, battle, of, elbistan, 1277, by, using, the, feigned, retreat, tactic, 156, mamluks, in, the, empire, retained, a, particularly, strong, sense, of, cuman, identity, to, the, degree, that, the, biography, of, sultan, baibars, as, reflected, by, ibn, shaddad, focused, on, his, birth, and, early, years, in, desht, i, kipchak, steppe, of, the, kipchaks, cumania, as, well, as, enslavement, and, subsequent, travels, to, bulgaria, and, the, near, east, the, historian, dimitri, korobeinikov, relates, how, baibars, story, sums, up, the, tragic, fate, of, many, cumans, after, the, battle, of, the, kalka, river, 1223, and, the, mongol, invasion, of, europe, 1223, 1242, roman, kovalev, states, that, this, story, can, further, be, seen, as, a, mechanism, for, the, preservation, of, a, collective, memory, broadly, reflecting, a, sense, of, cuman, identity, in, the, mamluk, sultanate, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 1260s, the, mamluks, were, allied, with, the, golden, horde, against, the, ilkhanate, the, creation, of, this, specific, warrior, class, described, as, the, mamluk, phenomenon, by, david, ayalon, was, of, great, political, importance, in, the, hungarian, village, of, csengele, on, the, borders, of, what, is, still, called, kiskunsag, little, cumania, an, archeological, excavation, in, 1975, revealed, the, ruins, of, a, medieval, church, with, 38, burials, several, burials, had, all, the, characteristics, of, a, cumanian, group, richly, jeweled, non, hungarian, and, definitely, cumanian, type, costumes, the, 12, spiked, mace, as, a, weapon, bone, girdles, and, associated, pig, bones, in, view, of, the, cultural, objects, and, the, historical, data, the, archeologists, concluded, that, the, burials, were, indeed, cumanian, from, the, mid, 13th, century, hence, some, of, the, early, settlers, in, hungary, were, from, that, ethnic, group, in, 1999, the, grave, of, a, high, status, cumanian, from, the, same, period, was, discovered, about, 50, meters, from, the, church, of, csengele, this, was, the, first, anthropologically, authenticated, grave, of, a, cumanian, chieftain, in, hungary, and, the, contents, are, consistent, with, the, ethnic, identity, of, the, excavated, remains, from, the, church, burials, a, separated, area, of, the, chieftain, grave, contained, a, complete, skeleton, of, a, horse, the, ethnic, origins, of, the, cumans, are, uncertain, 279, 30, according, to, some, contemporary, sources, the, cumans, were, reported, to, have, had, blond, hair, fair, skin, and, blue, eyes, which, set, them, apart, from, other, groups, and, later, puzzled, historians, 36, 43, however, craniometric, and, genetic, data, as, well, as, contemporary, art, support, a, picture, of, a, people, who, were, very, heterogeneous, in, appearance, a, genetic, study, analyzing, putatively, cuman, specimens, in, hungary, determined, that, they, had, a, high, frequency, of, western, eurasian, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, lineages, in, a, 2005, study, by, erika, bogacsi, szabo, et, al, of, the, mtdna, of, the, cuman, nomad, population, that, migrated, into, the, carpathian, basin, during, the, 13th, century, six, haplogroups, were, revealed, one, of, these, haplogroups, belongs, to, the, m, lineage, haplogroup, d, and, is, characteristic, of, eastern, asia, but, this, is, the, second, most, frequent, haplogroup, in, southern, siberia, too, all, the, other, haplogroups, h, v, u, u3, and, jt, are, west, eurasian, belonging, to, the, n, macrohaplogroup, out, of, the, eleven, remains, four, samples, belonged, to, haplogroup, h, two, to, haplogroup, u, two, to, haplogroup, v, and, one, each, to, the, jt, u3, and, d, haplogroups, in, comparison, to, the, cumans, modern, hungarian, samples, represent, 15, haplogroups, all, but, one, is, a, west, eurasian, haplogroup, but, all, belong, to, the, n, lineage, four, haplogroups, h, v, u, jt, present, in, the, ancient, samples, can, also, be, found, in, the, modern, hungarians, but, only, for, haplogroups, h, and, v, were, identical, haplotypes, found, haplogroups, u3, and, d, occur, exclusively, in, the, ancient, group, and, 11, haplogroups, hv, u4, u5, k, j, j1a, t, t1, t2, w, and, f, occur, only, in, the, modern, hungarian, population, haplogroup, frequency, in, the, modern, hungarian, population, is, similar, to, other, european, populations, although, haplogroup, f, is, almost, absent, in, continental, europe, therefore, the, presence, of, this, haplogroup, in, the, modern, hungarian, population, can, reflect, some, past, contribution, the, results, suggested, that, the, cumanians, as, seen, in, the, excavation, at, csengele, were, far, from, genetic, homogeneity, nevertheless, the, grave, artifacts, are, typical, of, the, cumanian, steppe, culture, and, five, of, the, six, skeletons, that, were, complete, enough, for, anthropometric, analysis, appeared, asian, rather, than, european, horv, th, 1978, 2001, including, two, from, the, mitochondrial, haplogroup, h, which, is, typically, european, it, is, interesting, that, the, only, skeleton, for, which, anthropological, examination, indicated, a, partly, european, ancestry, was, that, of, the, chieftain, whose, haplotype, is, most, frequently, found, in, the, balkans, the, study, concluded, that, the, mitochondrial, motifs, of, cumans, from, csengele, show, the, genetic, admixtures, with, other, populations, rather, than, the, ultimate, genetic, origins, of, the, founders, of, cuman, culture, the, study, further, mentioned, this, may, be, the, result, of, the, habits, of, the, cumanian, nomads, horsemen, of, the, steppes, formed, a, political, unit, that, was, independent, from, their, maternal, descent, or, their, language, and, became, members, of, a, tribal, confederation, according, to, legends, cumanians, frequently, carried, off, women, from, raided, territories, so, the, maternal, lineages, of, a, large, part, of, the, group, would, reflect, the, maternal, lineage, of, those, populations, that, had, geographic, connection, with, cumanians, during, their, migrations, nevertheless, the, asian, mitochondrial, haplotype, in, sample, cu26, may, still, reflect, the, asian, origins, of, the, cumanians, of, csengele, however, by, the, time, the, cumanians, left, the, trans, carpathian, steppes, and, settled, in, hungary, they, had, acquired, several, more, westerly, genetic, elements, probably, from, the, slavic, ugric, and, turkic, speaking, peoples, who, inhabited, the, regions, north, of, the, black, and, caspian, seas, the, results, from, the, cuman, samples, were, plotted, on, a, graph, with, other, eurasian, populations, showing, the, genetic, distances, between, them, the, eurasian, populations, were, divided, into, two, distinct, clusters, one, cluster, contained, all, the, eastern, and, central, asian, populations, and, can, be, divided, into, two, subclusters, one, subcluster, includes, mainly, eastern, asian, populations, buryat, korean, and, kirghiz, lowland, populations, and, the, other, subcluster, harbors, mainly, central, asian, populations, mongolian, kazakh, kirghiz, highland, and, uyghur, populations, the, second, cluster, contained, the, european, populations, inside, the, second, cluster, based, on, hvs, i, motifs, a, clear, structure, was, not, detectable, but, almost, all, european, populations, including, the, modern, hungarians, assembled, in, one, section, with, small, distances, between, each, other, cumans, were, outside, this, section, they, were, found, to, be, above, the, abscissa, of, the, graph, this, is, the, population, from, the, second, cluster, which, is, closest, to, the, east, central, asian, cluster, the, modern, cumans, of, csengele, hungary, are, genetically, nearest, to, the, finnish, komi, and, turkish, populations, the, modern, day, cuman, descendants, in, hungary, are, differentiated, genetically, from, the, hungarians, and, other, european, populations, in, relation, to, the, kumandins, pankratov, regarded, the, kumandins, as, being, related, anthropologically, to, the, urals, and, suggested, that, they, were, less, east, asian, than, the, altaians, proper, a, majority, of, mitochondrial, dna, lines, belonged, to, the, north, east, asian, haplogroups, c, or, d, with, also, a, large, minority, of, west, eurasian, lineages, such, as, u, cumans, appear, as, one, of, the, civilizations, that, players, can, play, as, in, the, 2019, strategy, game, age, of, empires, ii, definitive, edition, in, addition, players, can, play, a, campaign, which, tells, the, story, of, their, flight, westwards, as, they, retreat, from, the, mongols, cumans, appear, as, antagonists, in, the, 2018, role, playing, game, kingdom, come, deliverance
