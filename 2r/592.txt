of, 1867, forming, a, federation, in, canada, lord, carnarvon, thought, that, a, similar, political, effort, coupled, with, military, campaigns, might, lead, to, a, ruling, white, minority, over, a, black, majority, which, would, provide, a, large, pool, of, cheap, labour, for, the, british, sugar, plantations, and, mines, encompassing, the, african, kingdoms, tribal, areas, and, boer, republics, into, south, africa, in, 1874, sir, bartle, frere, was, sent, to, south, africa, as, high, commissioner, for, the, british, empire, to, effect, such, plans, among, the, obstacles, were, the, armed, independent, states, of, the, south, african, republic, and, the, kingdom, of, zululand, frere, on, his, own, initiative, sent, a, provocative, ultimatum, on, 11, december, 1878, to, the, zulu, king, cetshwayo, and, upon, its, rejection, sent, lord, chelmsford, to, invade, zululand, the, war, had, several, particularly, bloody, battles, including, an, opening, victory, of, the, zulu, at, the, battle, of, isandlwana, followed, by, the, defence, of, rorke, s, drift, by, a, small, british, garrison, from, an, attack, by, a, large, zulu, force, the, british, eventually, won, the, war, ending, zulu, dominance, of, the, region, the, zulu, kingdom, was, then, made, a, protectorate, and, later, annexed, by, the, british, empire, in, 1887, by, the, 1850s, the, british, empire, had, colonies, in, southern, africa, bordering, on, various, boer, settlements, native, african, kingdoms, such, as, the, zulus, and, the, basotho, and, numerous, indigenous, tribal, areas, and, states, various, interactions, with, those, groups, followed, an, expansionist, policy, cape, colony, was, formed, after, the, anglo, dutch, treaty, of, 1814, had, permanently, ceded, the, dutch, colony, of, cape, town, to, britain, and, its, territory, expanded, very, substantially, in, the, 19th, century, natal, in, south, eastern, africa, was, claimed, by, the, british, as, a, colony, on, 4, may, 1843, after, the, british, government, had, annexed, the, boer, republic, of, natalia, matters, were, brought, to, a, head, when, three, sons, led, by, mehlokazulu, kasihayo, and, a, brother, of, the, zulu, inkosi, sihayo, organized, a, raid, into, natal, and, carried, off, two, women, who, were, under, british, protection, the, discovery, of, diamonds, in, 1867, near, the, vaal, river, some, 550, mi, 890, km, northeast, of, cape, town, ended, the, isolation, of, the, boers, in, the, interior, and, had, a, significant, effect, on, events, the, discovery, triggered, a, diamond, rush, that, attracted, people, from, all, over, the, world, which, turned, kimberley, into, a, town, of, 50, 000, within, five, years, and, drew, the, attention, of, british, imperial, interests, in, the, 1870s, the, british, annexed, west, griqualand, site, of, the, kimberley, diamond, discoveries, in, 1874, lord, carnarvon, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, who, had, brought, about, federation, in, canada, in, 1867, thought, that, a, similar, scheme, might, work, in, south, africa, the, south, african, plan, called, for, a, ruling, white, minority, over, a, black, majority, which, would, provide, a, large, pool, of, cheap, labour, for, the, british, sugar, plantations, and, mines, carnarvon, in, an, attempt, to, extend, british, influence, in, 1875, approached, the, boer, states, of, the, orange, free, state, and, the, transvaal, republic, and, tried, to, organize, a, federation, of, the, british, and, boer, territories, but, the, boer, leaders, turned, him, down, in, 1877, sir, bartle, frere, was, made, high, commissioner, for, southern, africa, by, lord, carnarvon, carnarvon, appointed, frere, to, the, position, on, the, understanding, that, he, would, work, to, enforce, carnarvon, s, confederation, plan, and, frere, could, then, become, the, first, british, governor, of, a, federated, southern, african, dominion, frere, was, sent, to, south, africa, as, high, commissioner, to, bring, this, plan, about, one, of, the, obstacles, to, such, a, scheme, was, the, presence, of, the, independent, boer, states, of, the, south, african, republic, informally, known, as, the, transvaal, republic, and, the, orange, free, state, and, the, kingdom, of, zululand, bartle, frere, wasted, no, time, in, putting, the, scheme, forward, and, manufacturing, a, casus, belli, against, the, zulu, by, exaggerating, the, significance, of, a, number, of, recent, incidents, by, 1877, sir, theophilus, shepstone, the, british, secretary, for, native, affairs, in, natal, annexed, the, transvaal, republic, for, britain, using, a, special, warrant, the, transvaal, boers, objected, but, as, long, as, the, zulu, threat, remained, found, themselves, between, two, threats, they, feared, that, if, they, took, up, arms, to, resist, the, british, annexation, king, cetshwayo, and, the, zulus, would, take, the, opportunity, to, attack, the, successive, british, annexations, and, in, particular, the, annexation, of, west, griqualand, caused, a, climate, of, simmering, unease, for, the, boer, republics, shepstone, railed, against, the, disruptive, effect, of, allowing, cetshwayo, s, regime, to, remain, zulu, power, he, said, is, the, root, and, real, strength, of, all, native, difficulties, in, south, africa, in, december, 1877, he, wrote, to, carnarvon, cetshwayo, is, the, secret, hope, of, every, petty, independent, chief, hundreds, of, miles, from, him, who, feels, a, desire, that, his, colour, shall, prevail, and, it, will, not, be, until, this, hope, is, destroyed, that, they, will, make, up, their, minds, to, submit, to, the, rule, of, civilisation, earlier, in, october, 1877, shepstone, had, attended, a, meeting, with, zulu, leaders, near, the, blood, river, to, resolve, the, land, dispute, between, the, zulus, and, the, boers, he, suggested, a, compromise, with, the, boers, and, the, meeting, broke, up, without, clear, resolutions, he, turned, against, the, zulus, with, vengeance, saying, he, had, come, into, possession, of, the, most, incontrovertible, overwhelming, and, clear, evidence, never, previously, disclosed, for, supporting, the, claims, of, the, boers, he, rejected, zulu, claims, as, characterised, by, lying, and, treachery, to, an, extent, that, i, could, not, have, believed, even, savages, are, capable, of, shepstone, in, his, capacity, as, british, governor, of, natal, had, expressed, concerns, about, the, zulu, army, under, king, cetshwayo, and, the, potential, threat, to, natal, especially, given, the, adoption, by, some, of, the, zulus, of, old, muskets, and, other, out, of, date, firearms, in, his, new, role, of, administrator, of, the, transvaal, he, was, now, responsible, for, protecting, the, transvaal, and, had, direct, involvement, in, the, zulu, border, dispute, from, the, side, of, the, transvaal, persistent, boer, representations, and, paul, kruger, s, diplomatic, manoeuvres, added, to, the, pressure, there, were, incidents, involving, zulu, paramilitary, actions, on, either, side, of, the, transvaal, natal, border, and, shepstone, increasingly, began, to, regard, king, cetshwayo, as, having, permitted, such, outrages, and, to, be, in, a, defiant, mood, king, cetshwayo, now, found, no, defender, in, natal, save, the, bishop, of, natal, john, colenso, colenso, advocated, for, native, africans, in, natal, and, zululand, who, had, been, unjustly, treated, by, the, colonial, regime, in, natal, in, 1874, he, took, up, the, cause, of, langalibalele, and, the, hlubi, and, ngwe, tribes, in, representations, to, the, colonial, secretary, lord, carnarvon, langalibalele, had, been, falsely, accused, of, rebellion, in, 1873, and, following, a, charade, of, a, trial, was, found, guilty, and, imprisoned, on, robben, island, in, taking, the, side, of, langalibalele, against, the, colonial, regime, in, natal, and, theophilus, shepstone, the, secretary, for, native, affairs, colenso, found, himself, even, further, estranged, from, colonial, society, in, natal, bishop, colenso, s, concern, about, the, misleading, information, that, was, being, provided, to, the, colonial, secretary, in, london, by, shepstone, and, the, governor, of, natal, prompted, him, to, champion, the, cause, of, the, zulus, against, boer, oppression, and, official, encroachments, he, was, a, prominent, critic, of, frere, s, efforts, to, depict, the, zulu, kingdom, as, a, threat, to, natal, colenso, s, campaigns, revealed, the, racialist, foundation, underpinning, the, colonial, regime, in, natal, and, made, him, enemies, among, the, colonists, british, prime, minister, benjamin, disraeli, s, tory, administration, in, london, did, not, want, a, war, with, the, zulus, the, fact, is, wrote, sir, michael, hicks, beach, who, was, to, replace, carnarvon, as, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, in, november, 1878, that, matters, in, eastern, europe, and, india, wore, so, serious, an, aspect, that, we, cannot, have, a, zulu, war, in, addition, to, other, greater, and, too, possible, troubles, however, sir, bartle, frere, had, already, been, into, the, cape, colony, as, governor, and, high, commissioner, since, 1877, with, the, brief, of, creating, a, confederation, of, south, africa, from, the, various, british, colonies, boer, republics, and, native, states, and, his, plans, were, well, advanced, he, had, concluded, that, the, powerful, zulu, kingdom, stood, in, the, way, of, this, and, so, was, receptive, to, shepstone, s, arguments, that, king, cetshwayo, and, his, zulu, army, posed, a, threat, to, the, peace, of, the, region, preparations, for, a, british, invasion, of, the, zulu, kingdom, had, been, underway, for, months, in, december, 1878, notwithstanding, the, reluctance, of, the, british, government, to, start, yet, another, colonial, war, frere, presented, cetshwayo, with, an, ultimatum, that, the, zulu, army, be, disbanded, and, the, zulus, accept, a, british, resident, this, was, unacceptable, to, the, zulus, as, it, effectively, meant, that, cetshwayo, had, he, agreed, would, have, lost, his, throne, shaka, zulu, the, first, zulu, king, had, through, war, and, conquest, built, the, small, zulu, tribe, into, the, zulu, kingdom, which, by, 1825, encompassed, an, area, of, around, 11, 500, square, miles, 30, 000, km, 2, in, 1828, he, was, assassinated, at, dukuza, by, one, of, his, indunas, and, two, of, his, half, brothers, one, of, whom, dinggh, kasenzangakhona, succeeded, him, as, king, by, the, 1830s, migrating, boers, came, into, conflict, with, the, zulu, kingdom, then, ruled, by, dingane, dingane, suffered, a, crushing, defeat, on, 16, december, 1838, when, he, attacked, a, group, of, 470, voortrekker, settlers, led, by, pretorius, at, the, battle, of, blood, river, dingane, s, half, brother, mpande, kasenzangakhona, then, defected, with, some, 17, 000, followers, and, allied, with, the, boers, against, dingane, dingane, was, assassinated, and, mpande, became, king, of, the, zulu, empire, in, 1839, the, boer, voortrekkers, under, pretorius, formed, the, boer, republic, of, natalia, south, of, the, tugela, and, west, of, the, british, settlement, of, port, natal, now, durban, mpande, and, pretorius, maintained, peaceful, relations, however, in, 1842, war, broke, out, between, the, british, and, the, boers, resulting, in, the, british, annexation, of, natalia, mpande, shifted, his, allegiance, to, the, british, and, remained, on, good, terms, with, them, in, 1843, mpande, ordered, a, purge, of, perceived, dissidents, within, his, kingdom, this, resulted, in, numerous, deaths, and, the, fleeing, of, thousands, of, refugees, into, neighbouring, areas, including, the, british, controlled, natal, many, of, these, refugees, fled, with, cattle, the, main, measure, of, the, zulu, wealth, mpande, began, raiding, the, surrounding, areas, culminating, in, the, invasion, of, swaziland, in, 1852, however, the, british, pressured, him, into, withdrawing, which, he, did, shortly, afterwards, at, this, time, a, battle, for, the, succession, broke, out, between, two, of, mpande, s, sons, cetshwayo, and, mbuyazi, this, culminated, in, 1856, with, the, battle, of, ndondakusuka, which, left, mbuyazi, dead, cetshwayo, then, set, about, usurping, his, father, s, authority, when, mpande, died, of, old, age, in, 1872, cetshwayo, took, over, as, ruler, in, 1861, umtonga, another, son, of, mpande, fled, to, the, utrecht, district, prompting, cetshwayo, to, assemble, an, army, on, the, nearby, frontier, according, to, claims, later, brought, forward, by, the, boers, cetshwayo, offered, the, farmers, a, strip, of, land, along, the, border, if, they, would, surrender, his, brother, the, boers, complied, on, the, condition, that, umtonga, s, life, was, spared, and, in, 1861, mpande, signed, a, deed, transferring, this, land, to, the, boers, the, south, boundary, of, the, land, added, to, utrecht, ran, from, rorke, s, drift, on, the, buffalo, to, a, point, on, the, pongola, river, the, boundary, was, beaconed, in, 1864, but, when, in, 1865, umtonga, again, fled, from, zululand, to, natal, cetshwayo, seeing, that, he, had, lost, his, part, of, the, bargain, for, he, feared, that, the, still, living, umtonga, might, be, used, to, supplant, him, as, mpande, had, been, used, to, supplant, dingane, removed, the, beacon, and, claimed, the, land, ceded, by, the, swazis, to, lydenburg, the, zulus, asserted, that, the, swazis, were, their, vassals, and, therefore, had, no, right, to, part, with, this, territory, for, a, year, a, boer, commando, unit, under, paul, kruger, and, an, army, under, cetshwayo, were, posted, to, defend, the, newly, acquired, utrecht, border, the, zulu, forces, took, back, their, land, north, of, the, pongola, questions, were, also, raised, as, to, the, validity, of, the, documents, signed, by, the, zulus, concerning, the, utrecht, strip, in, 1869, the, services, of, the, lieutenant, governor, of, natal, then, robert, william, keate, were, accepted, by, both, parties, as, arbitrator, but, the, attempt, then, made, to, settle, disagreements, proved, unsuccessful, in, spite, of, his, dislike, for, their, activities, cetshwayo, permitted, european, missionaries, in, zululand, though, he, did, not, harm, or, persecute, the, missionaries, themselves, several, converts, were, killed, the, missionaries, for, their, part, were, a, source, of, hostile, reports, while, numerous, zulus, of, rival, factions, fled, into, natal, and, some, of, the, surrounding, areas, cetshwayo, continued, and, maintained, the, peaceful, relations, with, the, natal, colonists, that, had, prevailed, for, decades, such, was, the, political, background, when, cetshwayo, became, absolute, ruler, of, the, zulus, upon, his, father, s, death, in, 1873, as, ruler, cetshwayo, set, about, reviving, the, military, methods, of, his, uncle, shaka, as, far, as, possible, he, formed, new, age, set, regiments, and, even, succeeded, in, equipping, his, regiments, with, a, few, antiquated, muskets, and, other, outdated, firearms, most, zulu, warriors, were, armed, with, an, iklwa, the, zulu, refinement, of, the, assegai, thrusting, spear, and, a, shield, made, of, cowhide, the, zulu, army, drilled, in, the, personal, and, tactical, use, and, coordination, of, this, weapons, system, while, some, zulus, also, had, firearms, their, marksmanship, training, was, poor, and, the, quality, and, supply, of, their, powder, and, shot, was, dreadful, the, zulu, attitude, towards, firearms, was, summarized, the, generality, of, zulu, warriors, however, would, not, have, firearms, the, arms, of, a, coward, as, they, said, for, they, enable, the, poltroon, to, kill, the, brave, without, awaiting, his, attack, the, tension, between, cetshwayo, and, the, transvaal, over, border, disputes, continued, sir, theophilus, shepstone, whom, cetshwayo, regarded, as, his, friend, had, supported, him, in, the, border, dispute, but, in, 1877, he, led, a, small, force, into, the, transvaal, and, persuaded, the, boers, to, give, up, their, independence, shepstone, became, administrator, of, the, transvaal, and, in, that, role, saw, the, border, dispute, from, the, other, side, shepstone, claimed, to, have, evidence, supporting, the, boer, position, but, ultimately, he, failed, to, provide, any, in, a, meeting, with, zulu, notables, at, blood, river, in, october, 1877, shepstone, attempted, to, placate, the, zulu, with, paternal, speeches, however, they, were, unconvinced, and, accused, shepstone, of, betraying, them, shepstone, s, subsequent, reports, to, carnarvon, then, began, to, paint, the, zulu, as, an, aggressive, threat, where, he, had, previously, presented, cetshwayo, in, a, most, favourable, light, in, february, 1878, a, commission, was, appointed, by, henry, bulwer, the, lieutenant, governor, of, natal, since, 1875, to, report, on, the, boundary, question, the, commission, reported, in, july, and, found, almost, entirely, in, favour, of, the, contention, of, the, zulu, however, sir, henry, bartle, frere, then, high, commissioner, and, still, pressing, forward, with, carnarvon, s, federation, plan, characterized, the, award, as, one, sided, and, unfair, to, the, boers, stipulated, that, on, the, land, being, given, to, the, zulu, the, boers, living, on, it, should, be, compensated, if, they, left, or, protected, if, they, remained, in, addition, frere, planned, to, use, the, meeting, on, the, boundary, commission, report, with, the, zulu, representatives, to, also, present, a, surprise, ultimatum, he, had, devised, that, would, allow, british, forces, under, lord, chelmsford, which, he, had, previously, been, instructed, to, use, only, in, defense, against, a, zulu, invasion, of, natal, to, instead, invade, zululand, three, incidents, occurred, in, late, july, august, and, september, which, frere, seized, upon, as, his, casus, belli, and, were, the, basis, for, the, ultimatum, with, which, frere, knew, cetshwayo, could, not, comply, giving, frere, a, pretext, to, attack, the, zulu, kingdom, the, first, two, incidents, related, to, the, flight, into, natal, of, two, wives, of, sihayo, kaxongo, and, their, subsequent, seizure, and, execution, by, his, brother, and, sons, and, were, described, thus, a, wife, of, the, chief, sihayo, had, left, him, and, escaped, into, natal, she, was, followed, by, a, party, of, zulus, under, mehlokazulu, the, chief, son, of, sihayo, and, his, brother, seized, at, the, kraal, where, she, had, taken, refuge, and, carried, back, to, zululand, where, she, was, put, to, death, in, accordance, with, zulu, law, a, week, later, the, same, young, men, with, two, other, brothers, and, an, uncle, captured, in, like, manner, another, refugee, wife, of, sihayo, in, the, company, of, the, young, man, with, whom, she, had, fled, this, woman, was, also, carried, back, and, is, supposed, to, have, been, put, to, death, likewise, the, young, man, with, her, although, guilty, in, zulu, eyes, of, a, most, heinous, crime, punishable, with, death, was, safe, from, them, on, english, soil, they, did, not, touch, him, the, third, incident, occurred, in, september, when, two, men, were, detained, while, on, a, sandbank, of, the, thukela, river, near, the, middle, drift, sir, bartle, frere, described, this, matter, in, a, despatch, to, sir, michael, hicks, beach, who, had, replaced, carnarvon, as, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, mr, smith, a, surveyor, in, the, colonial, engineer, department, was, on, duty, inspecting, the, road, down, to, the, tugela, near, fort, buckingham, which, had, been, made, a, few, years, ago, by, order, of, sir, garnet, wolseley, and, accompanied, by, mr, deighton, a, trader, resident, at, fort, buckingham, went, down, to, the, ford, across, the, tugela, the, stream, was, very, low, and, ran, under, the, zulu, bank, but, they, were, on, this, side, of, it, and, had, not, crossed, when, they, were, surrounded, by, a, body, of, 15, or, 20, armed, zulus, made, prisoners, and, taken, off, with, their, horses, which, were, on, the, natal, side, of, the, river, and, roughly, treated, and, threatened, for, some, time, though, ultimately, at, the, instance, of, a, headman, who, came, up, they, were, released, and, allowed, to, depart, by, themselves, these, incidents, were, flimsy, grounds, upon, which, to, found, an, invasion, of, zululand, bulwer, did, not, initially, hold, cetshwayo, responsible, for, what, was, clearly, not, a, political, act, in, the, seizure, and, murder, of, the, two, women, i, have, sent, a, message, to, the, zulu, king, to, inform, him, of, this, act, of, violence, and, outrage, by, his, subjects, in, natal, territory, and, to, request, him, to, deliver, up, to, this, government, to, be, tried, for, their, offence, under, the, laws, of, the, colony, the, persons, of, mehlokazulu, and, bekuzulu, the, two, sons, of, sirayo, who, were, the, leaders, of, the, party, cetshwayo, also, treated, the, complaint, rather, lightly, responding, cetywayo, is, sorry, to, have, to, acknowledge, that, the, message, brought, by, umlungi, is, true, but, he, begs, his, excellency, will, not, take, it, in, the, light, he, sees, the, natal, government, seem, to, do, as, what, sirayo, s, sons, did, he, can, only, attribute, to, a, rash, act, of, boys, who, in, the, zeal, for, their, father, s, house, did, not, think, of, what, they, were, doing, cetywayo, acknowledges, that, they, deserve, punishing, and, he, sends, some, of, his, izinduna, who, will, follow, umlungi, with, his, words, cetywayo, states, that, no, acts, of, his, subjects, will, make, him, quarrel, with, his, fathers, of, the, house, of, shaka, the, original, complaint, carried, to, cetshwayo, from, the, lieutenant, governor, was, in, the, form, of, a, request, for, the, surrender, of, the, culprits, the, request, was, subsequently, transformed, by, sir, bartle, frere, into, a, demand, frere, wrote, to, hicks, beach, 30, september, 1878, apart, from, whatever, may, be, the, general, wish, of, the, zulu, nation, it, seems, to, me, that, the, seizure, of, the, two, refugee, women, in, british, territory, by, an, armed, force, crossing, an, unmistakable, and, well, known, boundary, line, and, carrying, them, off, and, murdering, them, with, contemptuous, disregard, for, the, remonstrances, of, the, natal, policemen, is, itself, an, insult, and, a, violation, of, british, territory, which, cannot, be, passed, over, and, unless, apologised, and, atoned, for, by, compliance, with, the, lieutenant, governor, s, demands, that, the, leaders, of, the, murderous, gangs, shall, be, given, up, to, justice, it, will, be, necessary, to, send, to, the, zulu, king, an, ultimatum, which, must, put, an, end, to, pacific, relations, with, our, neighbours, in, reply, in, at, least, three, dispatches, 17, october, 21, november, and, 18, december, hicks, beach, emphatically, states, that, war, is, to, be, avoided, and, a, british, invasion, of, zululand, prohibited, from, 21, november, dispatch, her, majesty, s, government, have, arrived, it, is, my, duty, to, impress, upon, you, that, in, supplying, these, reinforcements, it, is, the, desire, of, her, majesty, s, government, not, to, furnish, means, for, a, campaign, of, invasion, and, conquest, but, to, afford, such, protection, as, may, be, necessary, at, this, juncture, to, the, lives, and, property, of, the, colonists, though, the, present, aspect, of, affairs, is, menacing, in, a, high, degree, i, can, by, no, means, arrive, at, the, conclusion, that, war, with, the, zulus, should, be, unavoidable, and, i, am, confident, that, you, in, concert, with, sir, h, bulwer, will, use, every, effort, to, overcome, the, existing, difficulties, by, judgment, and, forbearance, and, to, avoid, an, evil, so, much, to, be, deprecated, as, a, zulu, war, after, considerable, discussion, and, exchanges, of, views, between, sir, bartle, frere, and, sir, henry, ernest, gascoyne, bulwer, it, was, decided, to, arrange, a, meeting, with, representatives, of, the, zulu, king, the, ostensible, reason, for, this, indaba, was, to, present, the, findings, of, the, long, awaited, boundary, commission, to, the, zulu, people, the, occasion, was, also, to, be, used, to, present, the, king, with, an, ultimatum, when, the, ultimatum, was, presented, the, two, infractions, by, sihayo, s, sons, and, the, roughing, up, of, smith, and, deighton, had, become, only, part, of, the, justification, that, was, used, as, several, matters, had, arisen, in, the, meantime, one, of, them, was, cetshwayo, s, apparent, breaking, of, promises, to, mr, theophilus, shepstone, at, the, king, s, coronation, in, 1872, that, farcical, piece, of, theatre, had, been, agreed, to, by, cetshwayo, simply, to, satisfy, the, wishes, of, shepstone, and, meant, nothing, to, the, zulu, people, indeed, his, real, zulu, installation, had, taken, place, several, weeks, earlier, when, he, had, been, acclaimed, by, his, izinduna, a, second, addition, to, the, ultimatum, which, seems, almost, like, an, afterthought, required, the, surrender, of, mbelini, kamswati, mbelini, was, the, son, of, a, swazi, king, who, unsuccessfully, disputed, the, succession, with, his, brother, resulting, in, his, exile, from, the, kingdom, he, took, refuge, with, cetshwayo, and, was, granted, land, in, the, region, of, the, intombe, river, in, western, zululand, it, is, entirely, possible, that, cetshwayo, regarded, him, as, a, useful, buffer, between, him, and, the, boers, of, the, transvaal, here, he, took, up, residence, on, the, tafelberg, a, flat, topped, mountain, overlooking, the, river, something, of, a, brigand, mbelini, made, raids, on, anyone, in, his, area, boer, and, zulu, alike, accruing, cattle, and, prisoners, in, the, process, with, the, annexation, of, the, transvaal, britain, had, also, to, deal, with, mbelini, and, because, frere, was, convinced, that, the, bandit, chief, was, in, the, pay, of, the, zulu, king, his, surrender, was, included, in, the, ultimatum, the, light, in, which, mbelini, was, regarded, is, shown, in, a, paragraph, from, a, memorandum, written, by, sir, henry, bulwer, the, king, disowned, umbilini, s, acts, by, saying, that, umbilini, had, been, giving, him, trouble, that, he, had, left, the, zulu, country, in, order, to, wrest, the, swazi, chieftainship, from, his, brother, the, reigning, chief, and, that, if, he, returned, he, should, kill, him, but, there, is, nothing, to, show, that, he, has, in, any, way, punished, him, and, on, the, contrary, it, is, quite, certain, that, even, if, umbilini, did, not, act, with, the, express, orders, of, cetywayo, he, did, so, with, the, knowledge, that, what, he, was, doing, would, be, agreeable, to, the, king, frere, has, been, accused, of, chicanery, by, taking, deliberate, advantage, of, the, length, of, time, it, took, for, correspondence, to, pass, between, south, africa, and, london, to, conceal, his, intentions, from, his, political, masters, or, at, least, defer, giving, them, the, necessary, information, until, it, was, too, late, for, them, to, act, the, first, intimation, to, the, british, government, of, his, intention, to, make, demands, on, the, zulu, was, in, a, private, letter, to, hicks, beach, written, on, 14, october, 1878, the, letter, only, arrived, in, london, on, 16, november, and, by, then, messengers, had, already, been, despatched, from, natal, to, the, zulu, king, to, request, the, presence, of, a, delegation, at, the, lower, tugela, on, 11, december, for, the, purpose, of, receiving, the, boundary, commission, s, findings, had, hicks, beach, then, sent, off, a, telegraph, forbidding, any, action, other, than, the, announcement, of, the, boundary, award, it, might, have, arrived, in, south, africa, just, in, time, to, prevent, the, ultimatum, being, presented, no, prohibition, was, sent, and, could, hardly, be, expected, to, have, been, for, hicks, beach, had, no, means, of, knowing, the, urgency, of, the, events, that, were, in, train, nowhere, in, frere, s, letter, was, there, anything, to, indicate, how, soon, he, intended, to, act, nor, was, there, anything, to, suggest, how, stringent, his, demands, would, be, in, january, 1879, hicks, beach, wrote, to, bartle, frere, i, may, observe, that, the, communications, which, had, previously, been, received, from, you, had, not, entirely, prepared, them, her, majesty, s, government, for, the, course, which, you, have, deemed, it, necessary, to, take, the, representations, made, by, lord, chelmsford, and, yourself, last, autumn, as, to, the, urgent, need, of, strengthening, her, majesty, s, forces, in, south, africa, were, based, upon, the, imminent, danger, of, an, invasion, of, natal, by, the, zulus, and, the, inadequate, means, at, that, time, at, your, disposal, for, meeting, it, in, order, to, afford, protection, to, the, lives, and, property, of, the, colonists, the, reinforcements, asked, for, were, supplied, and, in, informing, you, of, the, decision, of, her, majesty, s, government, i, took, the, opportunity, of, impressing, upon, you, the, importance, of, using, every, effort, to, avoid, war, but, the, terms, which, you, have, dictated, to, the, zulu, king, however, necessary, to, relieve, the, colony, in, future, from, an, impending, and, increasing, danger, are, evidently, such, as, he, may, not, improbably, refuse, even, at, the, risk, of, war, and, i, regret, that, the, necessity, for, immediate, action, should, have, appeared, to, you, so, imperative, as, to, preclude, you, from, incurring, the, delay, which, would, have, been, involved, in, consulting, her, majesty, s, government, upon, a, subject, of, so, much, importance, as, the, terms, which, cetywayo, should, be, required, to, accept, before, those, terms, were, actually, presented, to, the, zulu, king, hicks, beach, had, earlier, admitted, his, helplessness, with, regard, to, the, frere, s, actions, in, a, telling, note, to, his, prime, minister, i, have, impressed, this, view, upon, sir, b, frere, both, officially, and, privately, to, the, best, of, my, power, but, i, cannot, really, control, him, without, a, telegraph, i, don, t, know, that, i, could, with, one, i, feel, it, is, as, likely, as, not, that, he, is, at, war, with, the, zulus, at, the, present, moment, frere, wanted, to, provoke, a, conflict, with, the, zulus, and, in, that, goal, he, succeeded, cetshwayo, rejected, the, demands, of, 11, december, by, not, responding, by, the, end, of, the, year, a, concession, was, granted, by, bartle, frere, until, 11, january, 1879, after, which, bartle, frere, deemed, a, state, of, war, to, exist, the, british, forces, intended, for, the, defense, of, natal, had, already, been, on, the, march, with, the, intention, to, attack, the, zulu, kingdom, on, 10, january, they, were, poised, on, the, border, on, 11, january, they, crossed, the, border, and, invaded, zululand, the, terms, included, in, the, ultimatum, were, delivered, to, the, representatives, of, king, cetshwayo, on, the, banks, of, the, thukela, river, at, the, ultimatum, tree, on, 11, december, 1878, no, time, was, specified, for, compliance, with, item, 4, twenty, days, were, allowed, for, compliance, with, items, 1, 3, that, is, until, 31, december, inclusive, ten, days, more, were, allowed, for, compliance, with, the, remaining, demands, items, 5, 13, the, earlier, time, limits, were, subsequently, altered, so, that, all, expired, on, 10, january, 1879, to, ensure, that, there, was, no, interference, from, london, frere, delayed, informing, the, colonial, office, about, his, ultimatum, until, it, was, too, late, for, it, to, be, countermanded, the, full, text, of, his, demands, did, not, reach, london, until, 2, january, 1879, by, then, chelmsford, had, assembled, an, army, of, 18, 000, men, redcoats, colonial, volunteers, and, natal, african, auxiliaries, along, the, zululand, border, ready, for, the, invasion, for, his, part, cetshwayo, strenuously, attempted, to, avoid, war, with, the, british, and, should, it, occur, to, limit, its, scope, and, effects, he, ordered, his, troops, to, defend, their, country, only, if, attacked, and, not, to, carry, the, war, beyond, its, borders, he, directed, them, to, avoid, killing, any, of, the, invaders, other, than, the, regular, british, soldiers, in, their, red, coats, the, pretext, for, the, war, had, its, origins, in, border, disputes, between, the, zulu, leader, cetshwayo, and, the, boers, in, the, transvaal, region, following, a, commission, inquiry, on, the, border, dispute, which, reported, in, favour, of, the, zulu, nation, in, july, 1878, sir, henry, bartle, frere, acting, on, his, own, added, an, ultimatum, to, the, commission, meeting, much, to, the, surprise, of, the, zulu, representatives, who, then, relayed, it, to, cetshwayo, cetshwayo, had, not, responded, by, the, end, of, the, year, so, an, extension, was, granted, by, bartle, frere, until, 11, january, 1879, cetshwayo, returned, no, answer, to, the, demands, of, bartle, frere, and, in, january, 1879, a, british, force, under, lieutenant, general, frederic, thesiger, 2nd, baron, chelmsford, invaded, zululand, without, authorization, by, the, british, government, the, exact, date, of, the, invasion, was, 11, january, 1879, chelmsford, crossed, the, buffalo, river, at, rorke, s, drift, an, old, irish, trader, s, post, that, had, become, a, mission, station, in, command, of, 4, 700, men, of, the, no, 3, column, which, included, 1, 900, white, troops, and, 2, 400, african, auxiliaries, lord, chelmsford, the, commander, in, chief, of, british, forces, during, the, war, initially, planned, a, five, pronged, invasion, of, zululand, composed, of, over, 16, 500, troops, in, five, columns, and, designed, to, encircle, the, zulu, army, and, force, it, to, fight, as, he, was, concerned, that, the, zulus, would, avoid, battle, the, zulu, capital, ulundi, was, about, 80, miles, inside, zulu, territory, in, the, event, chelmsford, settled, on, three, invading, columns, with, the, main, centre, column, now, consisting, of, some, 7, 800, men, comprising, richard, thomas, glyn, s, no, 3, column, and, anthony, durnford, s, no, 2, column, under, his, direct, command, he, moved, his, troops, from, pietermaritzburg, to, a, forward, camp, at, helpmekaar, past, greytown, on, 9, january, 1879, they, moved, to, rorke, s, drift, and, early, on, 11, january, commenced, crossing, the, buffalo, river, into, zululand, three, columns, were, to, invade, zululand, from, the, lower, drift, of, the, tugela, river, no, 1, column, under, col, charles, pearson, rorke, s, drift, no, 3, column, under, lord, chelmsford, and, utrecht, no, 4, column, under, col, evelyn, wood, respectively, their, objective, being, ulundi, the, royal, capital, durnford, s, no, 2, column, was, ordered, to, stay, on, the, defensive, near, the, middle, drift, of, the, tugela, river, while, cetshwayo, s, army, numbered, perhaps, 35, 000, men, it, was, essentially, a, militia, force, which, could, be, called, out, in, time, of, national, danger, it, had, a, very, limited, logistical, capacity, and, could, only, stay, in, the, field, a, few, weeks, before, the, troops, would, be, obliged, to, return, to, their, civilian, duties, zulu, warriors, were, armed, primarily, with, assegai, thrusting, spears, known, in, zulu, as, iklwa, clubs, some, throwing, spears, and, shields, made, of, cowhide, the, initial, entry, of, all, three, columns, was, unopposed, on, 22, january, the, centre, column, which, had, advanced, from, rorke, s, drift, was, encamped, near, isandlwana, on, the, morning, of, that, day, lord, chelmsford, split, his, forces, and, moved, out, to, support, a, reconnoitering, party, leaving, the, remaining, 1, 300, men, of, the, no, 3, column, under, the, command, of, colonel, pulleine, colonel, durnford, would, arrive, later, in, the, morning, with, 500, men, of, the, no, 2, column, to, reinforce, the, camp, the, british, were, outmanoeuvred, by, the, main, zulu, army, nearly, 20, 000, strong, led, by, ntshingwayo, khoza, chelmsford, was, lured, eastward, with, much, of, his, centre, column, by, a, zulu, diversionary, force, while, the, main, impi, attacked, his, camp, chelmsford, s, decision, not, to, set, up, the, british, camp, defensively, contrary, to, established, doctrine, and, ignoring, information, that, the, zulus, were, close, at, hand, were, decisions, that, the, british, were, soon, to, regret, the, ensuing, battle, of, isandlwana, was, the, greatest, victory, that, the, zulu, kingdom, would, enjoy, during, the, war, the, british, centre, column, was, wrecked, and, its, camp, annihilated, with, heavy, casualties, as, well, as, the, loss, of, all, its, supplies, ammunition, and, transport, the, defeat, left, chelmsford, no, choice, but, to, hastily, retreat, out, of, zululand, in, the, battle, s, aftermath, a, party, of, some, 4, 000, zulu, reserves, mounted, an, unauthorised, raid, on, the, nearby, british, army, border, post, of, rorke, s, drift, and, were, driven, off, after, 10, hours, of, ferocious, fighting, on, 23, january, while, the, british, central, column, under, chelmsford, s, command, was, thus, engaged, the, right, flank, column, on, the, coast, under, colonel, charles, pearson, crossed, the, tugela, river, skirmished, with, a, zulu, impi, that, was, attempting, to, set, up, an, ambush, at, the, inyezane, river, and, advanced, as, far, as, the, deserted, missionary, station, of, eshowe, which, he, set, about, fortifying, on, learning, of, the, disaster, at, isandlwana, pearson, made, plans, to, withdraw, back, beyond, the, tugela, river, however, before, he, had, decided, whether, or, not, to, put, these, plans, into, effect, the, zulu, army, managed, to, cut, off, his, supply, lines, and, the, siege, of, eshowe, had, begun, meanwhile, the, left, flank, column, at, utrecht, under, colonel, evelyn, wood, had, originally, been, charged, with, occupying, the, zulu, tribes, of, north, west, zululand, and, preventing, them, from, interfering, with, the, british, central, column, s, advance, on, ulundi, to, this, end, wood, set, up, camp, at, tinta, s, kraal, just, 10, miles, south, of, hlobane, mountain, where, a, force, of, 4, 000, zulus, had, been, spotted, he, planned, to, attack, them, on, 24, january, but, on, learning, of, the, disaster, at, isandlwana, he, decided, to, withdraw, back, to, the, kraal, thus, one, month, after, the, british, invasion, only, their, left, flank, column, remained, militarily, effective, and, it, was, too, weak, to, conduct, a, campaign, alone, the, first, invasion, of, zululand, had, been, a, failure, it, had, never, been, cetshwayo, s, intention, to, invade, natal, but, to, simply, fight, within, the, boundaries, of, the, zulu, kingdom, chelmsford, used, the, next, two, months, to, regroup, and, build, a, fresh, invading, force, with, the, initial, intention, of, relieving, pearson, at, eshowe, the, british, government, rushed, seven, regiments, of, reinforcements, to, natal, along, with, two, artillery, batteries, on, 12, march, an, armed, escort, of, stores, marching, to, luneberg, was, defeated, by, about, 500, zulus, at, the, battle, of, intombe, the, british, force, suffered, 80, killed, and, all, the, stores, were, lost, the, first, troops, arrived, at, durban, on, 7, march, on, the, 29th, a, column, under, lord, chelmsford, consisting, of, a, total, of, 5, 670, men, 3, 390, europeans, and, 2, 280, africans, marched, to, the, relief, of, eshowe, with, entrenched, camps, being, formed, each, night, chelmsford, ordered, sir, evelyn, wood, s, troops, to, attack, the, abaqulusi, zulu, stronghold, in, hlobane, lieutenant, colonel, redvers, buller, led, the, attack, on, hlobane, on, 28, march, however, as, the, zulu, main, army, of, 20, 000, men, approached, to, help, their, besieged, tribesmen, the, british, force, began, a, retreat, which, turned, into, a, rout, and, were, pursued, by, 1, 000, zulus, of, the, abaqulusi, who, inflicted, some, 225, casualties, on, the, british, force, the, next, day, 20, 000, zulu, warriors, attacked, wood, s, 2, 068, men, in, a, well, fortified, camp, at, kambula, apparently, without, cetshwayo, s, permission, the, british, held, them, off, in, the, battle, of, kambula, and, after, five, hours, of, heavy, attacks, the, zulus, withdrew, with, heavy, losses, but, were, pursued, by, british, mounted, troops, who, killed, many, more, fleeing, and, wounded, warriors, british, losses, amounted, to, 83, 28, killed, and, 55, wounded, while, the, zulus, lost, up, to, 2, 000, killed, the, effect, of, the, battle, of, kambula, on, the, zulu, army, was, severe, their, commander, mnyamana, buthelezi, tried, to, get, the, regiments, to, return, to, ulundi, but, many, demoralised, warriors, simply, went, home, while, woods, was, thus, engaged, chelmsford, s, column, was, marching, on, eshowe, on, 2, april, this, force, was, attacked, en, route, at, gingindlovu, the, zulu, being, repulsed, their, losses, were, heavy, estimated, at, 1, 200, but, the, british, suffered, only, two, dead, and, 52, wounded, and, the, next, day, they, relieved, pearson, s, men, they, evacuated, eshowe, on, 5, april, after, which, the, zulu, forces, burned, it, down, the, new, start, of, the, larger, heavily, reinforced, second, invasion, was, not, promising, for, the, british, despite, their, successes, at, kambula, gingindlovu, and, eshowe, they, were, right, back, where, they, had, started, from, at, the, beginning, of, january, nevertheless, chelmsford, had, a, pressing, reason, to, proceed, with, haste, sir, garnet, wolseley, was, being, sent, to, replace, him, and, he, wanted, to, inflict, a, decisive, defeat, on, cetshwayo, s, forces, before, then, with, yet, more, reinforcements, arriving, soon, to, total, 16, 000, british, and, 7, 000, native, troops, chelmsford, reorganised, his, forces, and, again, advanced, into, zululand, in, june, this, time, with, extreme, caution, building, fortified, camps, all, along, the, way, to, prevent, any, repeat, of, isandlwana, one, of, the, early, british, casualties, was, the, exiled, pretender, to, the, french, throne, prince, imperial, eugene, bonaparte, who, had, volunteered, to, serve, in, the, british, army, and, was, killed, on, 1, june, while, out, with, a, reconnoitering, party, cetshwayo, knowing, that, the, newly, reinforced, british, would, be, a, formidable, opponent, attempted, to, negotiate, a, peace, treaty, chelmsford, was, not, open, to, negotiations, as, he, wished, to, restore, his, reputation, before, wolseley, relieved, him, of, command, and, he, proceeded, to, the, royal, kraal, of, ulundi, intending, to, defeat, the, main, zulu, army, on, 4, july, the, armies, clashed, at, the, battle, of, ulundi, and, cetshwayo, s, forces, were, decisively, defeated, after, the, battle, of, ulundi, the, zulu, army, dispersed, most, of, the, leading, chiefs, tendered, their, submission, and, cetshwayo, became, a, fugitive, wolseley, having, relieved, chelmsford, after, ulundi, took, over, the, final, operations, on, 28, august, the, king, was, captured, and, sent, to, cape, town, it, is, said, that, scouts, spotted, the, water, carriers, of, the, king, distinctive, because, the, water, was, carried, above, not, upon, their, heads, his, deposition, was, formally, announced, to, the, zulu, wolseley, wasted, no, time, in, discarding, bartle, frere, s, confederation, scheme, and, drew, up, a, new, scheme, which, divided, zululand, into, thirteen, chiefdoms, headed, by, compliant, chiefs, which, ensured, that, the, zulus, would, no, longer, unite, under, a, single, king, and, made, internal, divisions, and, civil, wars, inevitable, the, dynasty, of, shaka, was, deposed, and, the, zulu, country, portioned, among, eleven, zulu, chiefs, including, zibhebhu, john, robert, dunn, a, white, adventurer, and, hlubi, a, basuto, chief, allied, to, the, british, in, the, war, chelmsford, received, a, knight, grand, cross, of, bath, largely, because, of, ulundi, however, he, was, severely, criticized, by, the, horse, guards, investigation, and, would, never, serve, in, the, field, again, bartle, frere, was, relegated, to, a, minor, post, in, cape, town, following, the, conclusion, of, the, anglo, zulu, war, bishop, colenso, interceded, on, behalf, of, cetshwayo, with, the, british, government, and, succeeded, in, getting, him, released, from, robben, island, and, returned, to, zululand, in, 1883, a, resident, melmoth, osborn, was, appointed, to, be, the, channel, of, communication, between, the, chiefs, and, the, british, government, this, arrangement, led, to, much, bloodshed, and, disturbance, and, in, 1882, the, british, government, determined, to, restore, cetshwayo, to, power, in, the, meantime, however, blood, feuds, had, been, engendered, between, the, chiefs, usibepu, zibebu, and, hamu, on, the, one, side, and, the, tribes, who, supported, the, ex, king, and, his, family, on, the, other, cetshwayo, s, party, who, now, became, known, as, the, usuthu, suffered, severely, at, the, hands, of, the, two, chiefs, who, were, aided, by, a, band, of, white, freebooters, when, cetshwayo, was, restored, usibepu, was, left, in, possession, of, his, territory, while, dunn, s, land, and, that, of, the, basuto, chief, the, country, between, the, tugela, river, and, the, umhlatuzi, i, e, adjoining, natal, was, constituted, a, reserve, in, which, locations, were, to, be, provided, for, zulu, unwilling, to, serve, the, restored, king, this, new, arrangement, proved, as, futile, as, had, wolseley, s, usibepu, having, created, a, formidable, force, of, well, armed, and, trained, warriors, and, being, left, in, independence, on, the, borders, of, cetshwayo, s, territory, viewed, with, displeasure, the, re, installation, of, his, former, king, and, cetshwayo, was, desirous, of, humbling, his, relative, a, collision, very, soon, took, place, usibepu, s, forces, were, victorious, and, on, 22, july, 1883, led, by, a, troop, of, mounted, boer, mercenary, troops, he, made, a, sudden, descent, upon, cetshwayo, s, kraal, at, ulundi, which, he, destroyed, massacring, such, of, the, inmates, of, both, sexes, as, could, not, save, themselves, by, flight, the, king, escaped, though, wounded, into, nkandla, forest, after, appeals, to, melmoth, osborn, he, moved, to, eshowe, where, he, died, soon, after, because, of, the, unusually, high, amount, of, casualties, the, british, suffered, as, a, result, of, combat, especially, given, that, they, were, facing, a, preindustrial, enemy, that, was, considered, racially, inferior, the, british, war, effort, was, widely, seen, as, a, poor, showing, british, casualties, resulting, from, combat, were, three, times, higher, than, those, from, disease, which, was, generally, a, larger, killer, in, british, colonial, conflicts
