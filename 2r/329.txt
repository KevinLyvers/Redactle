rather, than, religious, ones, until, abbasid, rule, in, the, 8th, century, however, there, was, little, work, in, translation, most, knowledge, of, greek, during, umayyad, rule, was, gained, from, scholars, of, greek, who, remained, from, the, byzantine, period, rather, than, through, widespread, translation, and, dissemination, of, texts, a, few, scholars, argue, that, translation, was, more, widespread, than, is, thought, during, this, period, but, this, remains, the, minority, view, the, main, period, of, translation, was, during, abbasid, rule, the, 2nd, abbasid, caliph, al, mansur,

the, juxtaposition, of, beliefs, the, abbasids, considered, it, valuable, to, look, at, islam, with, greek, eyes, and, to, look, at, the, greeks, with, islamic, eyes, abbasid, philosophers, also, advanced, the, idea, that, islam, had, from, the, very, beginning, stressed, the, gathering, of, knowledge, as, a, key, part, of, the, religion, these, new, ideas, enabled, the, amassing, and, translation, of, greek, concepts, to, disseminate, like, never, before, during, the, 12th, century, europe, enjoyed, great, advances, in, intellectual, achievements, sparked, in, part, by, the,

isabella, i, of, castile, in, 1469, at, the, palacio, de, los, vivero, in, valladolid, began, the, familial, union, of, the, two, kingdoms, they, became, known, as, the, catholic, monarchs, los, reyes, cat, licos, isabella, succeeded, her, brother, as, queen, of, castile, and, ferdinand, became, jure, uxoris, king, of, castile, in, 1474, when, ferdinand, succeeded, his, father, as, king, of, aragon, in, 1479, the, crown, of, castile, and, the, various, territories, of, the, crown, of, aragon, were, united, in, a, personal, union, creating, for, the, first, time, since, the, 8th, century, a, single, political, unit, referred, to, as, espa, a, spain, los, reyes, cat, licos, started, policies, that, diminished, the, power, of, the, bourgeoisie, and, nobility, in, castile, and, greatly, reduced, the, powers, of, the, cortes, general, courts, to, the, point, where, they, became, rubber, stamps, for, the, monarch, s, acts, they, also, brought, the, nobility, to, their, side, in, 1492, the, kingdom, of, castile, conquered, the, last, moorish, state, of, granada, thereby, ending, muslim, rule, in, iberia, and, completing, the, reconquista, on, isabella, s, death, in, 1504, her, daughter, joanna, i, became, queen, in, name, with, her, husband, philip, i, as, king, in, authority, after, his, death, joanna, s, father, was, regent, due, to, her, perceived, mental, illness, as, her, son, charles, i, was, only, six, years, old, on, ferdinand, ii, s, death, in, 1516, charles, i, was, proclaimed, as, king, of, castile, and, of, aragon, in, authority, jointly, with, his, mother, joanna, i, as, the, queen, of, castile, in, name, as, the, first, monarch, to, reign, over, castile, and, aragon, charles, i, may, be, considered, as, the, first, operational, king, of, spain, charles, i, also, became, charles, v, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1519, as, with, all, medieval, kingdoms, supreme, power, was, understood, to, reside, in, the, monarch, by, the, grace, of, god, as, the, legal, formula, explained, nevertheless, rural, and, urban, communities, began, to, form, assemblies, to, issue, regulations, to, deal, with, everyday, problems, over, time, these, assemblies, evolved, into, municipal, councils, known, as, variously, as, ayuntamientos, or, cabildos, in, which, some, of, the, inhabitants, the, property, owning, heads, of, households, vecinos, represented, the, rest, by, the, 14th, century, these, councils, had, gained, more, powers, such, as, the, right, to, elect, municipal, magistrates, and, officers, alcaldes, speakers, clerks, etc, and, representatives, to, the, parliaments, cortes, due, to, the, increasing, power, of, the, municipal, councils, and, the, need, for, communication, between, these, and, the, king, cortes, were, established, in, the, kingdom, of, le, n, in, 1188, and, in, castile, in, 1250, unlike, other, kingdoms, castile, didn, t, have, a, permanent, capital, neither, did, spain, until, the, 16th, century, so, the, cortes, were, celebrated, in, whichever, city, the, king, chose, to, stay, in, the, earliest, leonese, and, castilian, cortes, the, inhabitants, of, the, cities, known, as, laboratores, formed, a, small, group, of, the, representatives, and, had, no, legislative, powers, but, they, were, a, link, between, the, king, and, the, general, population, something, that, was, pioneered, by, the, kingdoms, of, castile, and, le, n, eventually, the, representatives, of, the, cities, gained, the, right, to, vote, in, the, cortes, often, allying, with, the, monarchs, against, the, great, noble, lords, during, the, reign, of, alfonso, viii, the, king, began, to, use, the, canting, arms, of, castile, as, its, emblem, in, its, blazons, and, banners, which, were, gules, a, three, towered, castle, or, masoned, sable, and, ajour, azure
