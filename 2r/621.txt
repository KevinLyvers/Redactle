between, different, empires, before, becoming, a, subject, of, the, roman, empire, in, the, first, century, ad, the, city, grew, wealthy, from, trade, caravans, the, palmyrenes, became, renowned, as, merchants, who, established, colonies, along, the, silk, road, and, operated, throughout, the, roman, empire, palmyra, s, wealth, enabled, the, construction, of, monumental, projects, such, as, the, great, colonnade, the, temple, of, bel, and, the, distinctive, tower, tombs, ethnically, the, palmyrenes, combined, elements, of, amorites, arameans, and, arabs, socially, structured, around, kinship, and, clans, palmyra, s, inhabitants, spoke, palmyrene, aramaic, a, variety, of, western, middle, aramaic, while, using, koine, greek, for, commercial, and, diplomatic, purposes, the, hellenistic, period, of, west, asia, influenced, the, culture, of, palmyra, which, produced, distinctive, art, and, architecture, that, combined, different, mediterranean, traditions, the, city, s, inhabitants, worshiped, local, semitic, mesopotamian, and, arab, deities, by, the, third, century, palmyra, had, become, a, prosperous, regional, center, it, reached, the, apex, of, its, power, in, the, 260s, when, the, palmyrene, king, odaenathus, defeated, the, sasanian, emperor, shapur, i, the, king, was, succeeded, by, queen, regent, zenobia, who, rebelled, against, rome, and, established, the, palmyrene, empire, in, 273, roman, emperor, aurelian, destroyed, the, city, which, was, later, restored, by, diocletian, at, a, reduced, size, the, palmyrenes, converted, to, christianity, during, the, fourth, century, and, to, islam, in, the, centuries, following, the, conquest, by, the, 7th, century, rashidun, caliphate, after, which, the, palmyrene, and, greek, languages, were, replaced, by, arabic, before, ad, 273, palmyra, enjoyed, autonomy, and, was, attached, to, the, roman, province, of, syria, having, its, political, organization, influenced, by, the, greek, city, state, model, during, the, first, two, centuries, ad, the, city, became, a, roman, colonia, during, the, third, century, leading, to, the, incorporation, of, roman, governing, institutions, before, becoming, a, monarchy, in, 260, following, its, destruction, in, 273, palmyra, became, a, minor, center, under, the, byzantines, and, later, empires, its, destruction, by, the, timurids, in, 1400, reduced, it, to, a, small, village, under, french, mandatory, rule, in, 1932, the, inhabitants, were, moved, into, the, new, village, of, tadmur, and, the, ancient, site, became, available, for, excavations, during, the, syrian, civil, war, in, 2015, the, islamic, state, captured, palmyra, and, destroyed, large, parts, of, the, ancient, city, which, was, recaptured, by, the, syrian, army, on, 2, march, 2017, while, reading, the, inscriptions, in, palmyra, one, has, the, impression, that, in, time, the, city, became, increasingly, familiar, with, rome, and, its, institutions, with, the, complicated, hierarchy, of, its, power, and, that, it, became, a, city, like, others, a, true, city, of, the, empire, records, of, the, name, tadmor, date, from, the, early, second, millennium, bc, eighteenth, century, bc, tablets, from, mari, written, in, cuneiform, record, the, name, as, ta, ad, mi, ir, while, assyrian, inscriptions, of, the, eleventh, century, bc, record, it, as, ta, ad, mar, aramaic, palmyrene, inscriptions, themselves, showed, two, variants, of, the, name, tdmr, i, e, tadmar, and, tdmwr, i, e, tadmor, the, etymology, of, the, name, is, unclear, the, standard, interpretation, supported, by, albert, schultens, connects, it, to, the, semitic, word, for, date, palm, tamar, thus, referring, to, the, palm, trees, that, surrounded, the, city, the, greek, name, latinized, palmyra, was, first, recorded, by, pliny, the, elder, in, the, 1st, century, ad, it, was, used, throughout, the, greco, roman, world, it, is, generally, believed, that, palmyra, derives, from, tadmor, and, linguists, have, presented, two, possibilities, one, view, holds, that, palmyra, was, an, alteration, of, tadmor, according, to, the, suggestion, by, schultens, palmyra, could, have, arisen, as, a, corruption, of, tadmor, via, an, unattested, form, talmura, changed, to, palmura, by, the, influence, of, the, latin, word, palma, date, palm, in, reference, to, the, city, s, palm, trees, then, the, name, reached, its, final, form, palmyra, the, second, view, supported, by, some, philologists, such, as, jean, starcky, holds, that, palmyra, is, a, translation, of, tadmor, assuming, that, it, meant, palm, which, had, derived, from, the, greek, word, for, palm, palame, an, alternative, suggestion, connects, the, name, to, the, syriac, tedmurt, miracle, hence, tedmurt, object, of, wonder, from, the, root, dmr, to, wonder, this, possibility, was, mentioned, favourably, by, franz, altheim, and, ruth, altheim, stiehl, 1973, but, rejected, by, jean, starcky, 1960, and, michael, gawlikowski, 1974, michael, patrick, o, connor, 1988, suggested, that, the, names, palmyra, and, tadmor, originated, in, the, hurrian, language, as, evidence, he, cited, the, inexplicability, of, alterations, to, the, theorized, roots, of, both, names, represented, in, the, addition, of, d, to, tamar, and, ra, to, palame, according, to, this, theory, tadmor, derives, from, the, hurrian, word, tad, to, love, with, the, addition, of, the, typical, hurrian, mid, vowel, rising, mvr, formant, mar, similarly, according, to, this, theory, palmyra, derives, from, the, hurrian, word, pal, to, know, using, the, same, mvr, formant, mar, the, city, of, palmyra, lies, 215, km, 134, mi, northeast, of, the, syrian, capital, damascus, along, with, an, expanded, hinterland, of, several, settlements, farms, and, forts, the, city, forms, part, of, the, region, known, as, the, palmyrene, the, city, is, located, in, an, oasis, surrounded, by, palms, of, which, twenty, varieties, have, been, reported, two, mountain, ranges, overlook, the, city, the, northern, palmyrene, mountain, belt, from, the, north, and, the, southern, palmyrene, mountains, from, the, southwest, in, the, south, and, the, east,

the, oasis, south, of, the, wadi, is, a, spring, efqa, pliny, the, elder, described, the, town, in, the, 70s, ad, as, famous, for, its, desert, location, for, the, richness, of, its, soil, and, for, the, springs, surrounding, it, which, made, agriculture, and, herding, possible, palmyra, began, as, a, small, neolithic, settlement, near, the, efqa, spring, on, the, southern, bank, of, wadi, al, qubur, the, much, later, hellenistic, settlement, of, palmyra, was, also, located, near, the, efqa, spring, on, the, southern, bank, of, wadi, al, qubur, it, had, its, residences, expanding, to, the, wadi, s, northern, bank, during, the, first, century, although, the, city, s, walls, at, the, time, of, zenobia, originally, enclosed, an, extensive, area, on, both, banks, of, the, wadi, the, walls, rebuilt, during, aurelian, s, reign, surrounded, only, the, northern, bank, section, most, of, the, city, s, monumental, projects, were, built, on, the, wadi, s, northern, bank, among, them, is, the, temple, of, bel, on, a, tell, which, was, the, site, of, an, earlier, temple, known, as, the, hellenistic, temple, however, excavation, supports, the, theory, that, the, tell, was, originally, located, on, the, southern, bank, and, the, wadi, was, diverted, south, of, the, tell, to, incorporate, the, temple, into, palmyra, s, late, first, and, early, second, century, urban, organization, on, the, north, bank, also, north, of, the, wadi, was, the, great, colonnade, palmyra, s, 1, 1, kilometre, long, 0, 68, mi, main, street, which, extended, from, the, temple, of, bel, in, the, east, to, the, funerary, temple, no, 86, in, the, city, s, western, part, it, had, a, monumental, arch, in, its, eastern, section, and, a, tetrapylon, stands, in, the, center, the, baths, of, diocletian, were, on, the, left, side, of, the, colonnade, nearby, were, residences, the, temple, of, baalshamin, and, the, byzantine, churches, which, include, basilica, iv, palmyra, s, largest, church, the, church, is, dated, to, the, justinian, age, its, columns, are, estimated, to, be, 7, metres, 23, ft, high, and, its, base, measured, 27, 5, by, 47, 5, metres, 90, by, 156, ft, the, temple, of, nabu,

and, by, the, end, of, the, millennium, arameans, were, mentioned, as, inhabiting, the, area, arabs, arrived, in, the, city, in, the, late, first, millennium, bc, zabdibel, who, aided, the, seleucids, in, the, battle, of, raphia, 217, bc, was, mentioned, as, the, commander, of, the, arabs, and, neighbouring, tribes, to, the, number, of, ten, thousands, zabdibel, and, his, men, were, not, actually, identified, as, palmyrenes, in, the, texts, but, the, name, zabdibel, is, a, palmyrene, name, leading, to, the, conclusion, that, he, hailed, from, palmyra, the, arab, newcomers, were, assimilated, by, the, earlier, inhabitants, used, palmyrene, as, a, mother, tongue, and, formed, a, significant, segment, of, the, aristocracy, at, its, height, during, the, reign, of, zenobia, around, 270, palmyra, had, more, than, 200, 000, residents, the, classical, city, also, had, a, jewish, community, inscriptions, in, palmyrene, from, the, beit, she, arim, necropolis, in, lower, galilee, confirm, the, burial, of, palmyrene, jews, during, the, roman, period, occasionally, and, rarely, members, of, the, palmyrene, families, took, greek, names, while, ethnic, greeks, were, few, the, majority, of, people, with, greek, names, who, did, not, belong, to, one, of, the, city, s, families, were, freed, slaves, the, palmyrenes, seem, to, have, disliked, the, greeks, considered, them, foreigners, and, restricted, their, settlement, in, the, city, during, the, umayyad, caliphate, palmyra, was, mainly, inhabited, by, the, banu, kalb, benjamin, of, tudela, recorded, the, existence, of, 2000, jews, in, the, city, during, the, twelfth, century, palmyra, declined, after, its, destruction, by, timur, in, 1400, and, was, a, village, of, 6, 000, inhabitants, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, palmyra, s, population, was, a, mixture, of, the, different, peoples, inhabiting, the, city, which, is, seen, in, aramaic, arabic, and, amorite, names, of, palmyrene, clans, but, the, ethnicity, of, palmyra, is, a, matter, of, debate, some, scholars, such, as, andrew, m, smith, ii, consider, ethnicity, a, concept, related, to, modern, nationalism, and, prefer, not, to, describe, the, palmyrenes, with, ethnic, designations, they, themselves, did, not, know, concluding, that, there, is, a, lack, of, evidence, regarding, what, ethnicity, the, palmyrenes, perceived, themselves, on, the, other, hand, many, scholars, such, as, eivind, seland, contend, that, a, distinctive, palmyrene, ethnicity, is, apparent, in, the, available, contemporary, evidence, the, second, century, work, de, munitionibus, castrorum, mentioned, the, palmyrenes, as, a, natio, the, latin, equivalent, of, the, greek, thnos, seland, noted, the, epigraphic, evidence, left, by, the, palmyrenes, outside, the, city, the, inscriptions, reveal, the, existence, of, a, real, diaspora, satisfying, the, three, criteria, set, by, the, sociologist, rogers, brubaker, palmyrene, diaspora, members, always, made, clear, their, palmyrene, origin, and, used, the, palmyrene, language, and, maintained, their, distinct, religion, even, when, the, host, society, s, religion, was, close, to, that, of, palmyra, seland, concluded, that, in, the, case, of, palmyra, the, people, perceived, themselves, different, from, their, neighbours, and, a, real, palmyrene, ethnicity, existed, aside, from, the, existence, of, a, palmyrene, ethnicity, aramean, or, arab, are, the, two, main, ethnic, designations, debated, by, historians, javier, teixidor, stated, palmyra, was, an, aramaean, city, and, it, is, a, mistake, to, consider, it, as, an, arab, town, while, yasamin, zahran, criticized, this, statement, and, argued, that, the, inhabitants, considered, themselves, arabs, in, practice, according, to, several, scholars, such, as, udo, hartmann, and, michael, sommer, the, citizenry, of, palmyra, were, mainly, the, result, of, arab, and, aramaean, tribes, merging, into, a, unity, with, a, corresponding, consciousness, they, thought, and, acted, as, palmyrenes, until, the, late, third, century, palmyrenes, spoke, palmyrene, aramaic, and, used, the, palmyrene, alphabet, the, use, of, latin, was, minimal, but, greek, was, used, by, wealthier, members, of, society, for, commercial, and, diplomatic, purposes, and, it, became, the, dominant, language, during, the, byzantine, era, there, are, several, theories, explaining, the, disappearance, of, the, palmyrene, language, shortly, after, the, campaigns, of, aurelian, the, linguist, jean, cantineau, assumed, that, aurelian, suppressed, all, aspects, of, palmyrene, culture, including, the, language, but, the, last, palmyrene, inscription, dates, to, 279, 280, after, the, death, of, the, roman, emperor, in, 275, thus, refuting, such, a, theory, many, scholars, ascribe, the, disappearance, of, the, language, to, a, change, in, society, resulting, from, the, reorganization, of, the, eastern, roman, frontier, following, the, fall, of, zenobia, the, archaeologist, karol, juchniewicz, ascribed, it, to, a, change, in, the, ethnic, composition, of, the, city, resulting, from, the, influx, of, people, who, did, not, speak, aramaic, probably, a, roman, legion, hartmann, suggested, that, it, was, a, palmyrene, initiative, by, nobles, allied, to, rome, attempting, to, express, their, loyalty, to, the, emperor, hartmann, noted, that, palmyrene, disappeared, in, the, written, form, and, that, this, does, not, mean, its, extinction, as, spoken, language, after, the, arab, conquest, greek, was, replaced, by, arabic, from, which, although, the, city, was, surrounded, by, bedouins, a, palmyrene, dialect, evolved, classical, palmyra, was, a, tribal, community, but, due, to, the, lack, of, sources, an, understanding, of, the, nature, of, palmyrene, tribal, structure, is, not, possible, thirty, clans, have, been, documented, five, of, which, were, identified, as, tribes, phylai, koin, greek, pl, of, phyle, comprising, several, sub, clans, by, the, time, of, nero, palmyra, had, four, tribes, each, residing, in, an, area, of, the, city, bearing, its, name, three, of, the, tribes, were, the, komare, mattabol, and, ma, zin, the, fourth, tribe, is, uncertain, but, was, probably, the, mita, in, time, the, four, tribes, became, highly, civic, and, tribal, lines, blurred, by, the, second, century, clan, identity, lost, its, importance, and, it, disappeared, during, the, third, century, even, the, four, tribes, ceased, to, be, important, by, the, third, century, as, only, one, inscription, mentions, a, tribe, after, the, year, 212, instead, aristocrats, played, the, decisive, role, in, the, city, s, social, organization, women, seem, to, have, been, active, in, palmyra, s, social, and, public, life, they, commissioned, inscriptions, buildings, or, tombs, and, in, certain, cases, held, administrative, offices, offerings, to, gods, in, the, names, of, women, are, documented, the, last, palmyrene, inscription, of, 279, 280, refers, to, the, honouring, of, a, citizen, by, the, maththabolians, which, indicates, that, the, tribal, system, still, carried, weight, after, the, fall, of, zenobia, a, noticeable, change, is, the, lack, of, development, of, aristocratic, residences, and, no, important, public, buildings, were, constructed, by, locals, indicating, that, the, elite, diminished, following, the, campaign, of, aurelian, the, social, change, and, the, reduction, of, the, aristocratic, elite, is, hard, to, explain, it, could, be, a, result, of, the, aristocracy, suffering, many, casualties, in, the, war, against, rome, or, fleeing, to, the, countryside, according, to, historian, emanuele, intagliata, the, change, can, be, ascribed, to, the, roman, reorganization, following, zenobia, s, fall, as, palmyra, ceased, to, be, a, rich, caravan, city, and, became, a, frontier, fortress, leading, the, inhabitants, to, focus, on, satisfying, the, needs, of, a, garrison, instead, of, providing, the, empire, with, luxurious, oriental, items, such, a, change, in, functions, would, have, made, the, city, less, attractive, for, an, aristocratic, elite, palmyra, benefited, from, umayyad, rule, since, its, role, as, a, frontier, city, ended, and, the, east, west, trade, route, was, restored, leading, to, the, re, emergence, of, a, merchant, class, palmyra, s, loyalty, to, the, umayyads, led, to, an, aggressive, military, retaliation, from, their, successors, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, the, city, diminished, in, size, losing, its, merchant, class, following, its, destruction, by, timur, palmyra, maintained, the, life, of, a, small, settlement, until, its, relocation, in, 1932, the, scarce, artifacts, found, in, the, city, dating, to, the, bronze, age, reveal, that, culturally, palmyra, was, most, affiliated, with, western, syria, classical, palmyra, had, a, distinctive, culture, based, on, a, local, semitic, tradition, and, influenced, by, greece, and, rome, to, appear, better, integrated, into, the, roman, empire, some, palmyrenes, adopted, greco, roman, names, either, alone, or, in, addition, to, a, second, native, name, the, extent, of, greek, influence, on, palmyra, s, culture, is, debated, scholars, interpreted, the, palmyrenes, greek, practices, differently, many, see, those, characters, as, a, superficial, layer, over, a, local, essence, palmyra, s, senate, was, an, example, although, palmyrene, texts, written, in, greek, described, it, as, a, boule, a, greek, institution, the, senate, was, a, gathering, of, non, elected, tribal, elders, a, near, eastern, assembly, tradition, others, view, palmyra, s, culture, as, a, fusion, of, local, and, greco, roman, traditions, the, culture, of, persia, influenced, palmyrene, military, tactics, dress, and, court, ceremonies, palmyra, had, no, large, libraries, or, publishing, facilities, and, it, lacked, an, intellectual, movement, characteristic, of, other, eastern, cities, such, as, edessa, or, antioch, although, zenobia, opened, her, court, to, academics, the, only, notable, scholar, documented, was, cassius, longinus, palmyra, had, a, large, agora, however, unlike, the, greek, agoras, public, gathering, places, shared, with, public, buildings, palmyra, s, agora, resembled, an, eastern, caravanserai, more, than, a, hub, of, public, life, the, palmyrenes, buried, their, dead, in, elaborate, family, mausoleums, most, with, interior, walls, forming, rows, of, burial, chambers, loculi, in, which, the, dead, lying, at, full, length, were, placed, a, relief, of, the, person, interred, formed, part, of, the, wall, s, decoration, acting, as, a, headstone, sarcophagi, appeared, in, the, late, second, century, and, were, used, in, some, of, the, tombs, many, burial, monuments, contained, mummies, embalmed, in, a, method, similar, to, that, used, in, ancient, egypt, although, palmyrene, art, was, related, to, that, of, greece, it, had, a, distinctive, style, unique, to, the, middle, euphrates, region, palmyrene, art, is, well, represented, by, the, bust, reliefs, which, seal, the, openings, of, its, burial, chambers, the, reliefs, emphasized, clothing, jewelry, and, a, frontal, representation, of, the, person, depicted, characteristics, which, can, be, seen, as, a, forerunner, of, byzantine, art, according, to, michael, rostovtzeff, palmyra, s, art, was, influenced, by, parthian, art, however, the, origin, of, frontality, that, characterized, palmyrene, and, parthian, arts, is, a, controversial, issue, while, parthian, origin, has, been, suggested, by, daniel, schlumberger, michael, avi, yonah, contends, that, it, was, a, local, syrian, tradition, that, influenced, parthian, art, little, painting, and, none, of, the, bronze, statues, of, prominent, citizens, which, stood, on, brackets, on, the, main, columns, of, the, great, colonnade, have, survived, a, damaged, frieze, and, other, sculptures, from, the, temple, of, bel, many, removed, to, museums, in, syria, and, abroad, suggest, the, city, s, public, monumental, sculpture, many, surviving, funerary, busts, reached, western, museums, during, the, 19th, century, palmyra, provided, the, most, convenient, eastern, examples, bolstering, an, art, history, controversy, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, to, what, extent, eastern, influence, on, roman, art, replaced, idealized, classicism, with, frontal, hieratic, and, simplified, figures, as, believed, by, josef, strzygowski, and, others, this, transition, is, seen, as, a, response, to, cultural, changes, in, the, western, roman, empire, rather, than, artistic, influence, from, the, east, palmyrene, bust, reliefs, unlike, roman, sculptures, are, rudimentary, portraits, although, many, reflect, high, quality, individuality, the, majority, vary, little, across, figures, of, similar, age, and, gender, like, its, art, palmyra, s, architecture, was, influenced, by, the, greco, roman, style, while, preserving, local, elements, best, seen, in, the, temple, of, bel, enclosed, by, a, massive, wall, flanked, with, traditional, roman, columns, bel, s, sanctuary, plan, was, primarily, semitic, similar, to, the, second, temple, the, sanctuary, consisted, of, a, large, courtyard, with, the, deity, s, main, shrine, off, center, against, its, entrance, a, plan, preserving, elements, of, the, temples, of, ebla, and, ugarit, west, of, the, ancient, walls, the, palmyrenes, built, a, number, of, large, scale, funerary, monuments, which, now, form, the, valley, of, tombs, a, one, kilometre, long, 0, 62, mi, necropolis, the, more, than, 50, monuments, were, primarily, tower, shaped, and, up, to, four, stories, high, towers, were, replaced, by, funerary, temples, in, the, first, half, of, the, second, century, ad, as, the, most, recent, tower, is, dated, to, ad, 128, the, city, had, other, cemeteries, in, the, north, southwest, and, southeast, where, the, tombs, are,

temple, of, sol, invictus, in, rome, most, scholars, consider, aurelian, s, sol, invictus, to, be, of, syrian, origin, either, a, continuation, of, emperor, elagabalus, cult, of, sol, invictus, elagabalus, or, malakbel, of, palmyra, the, palmyrene, deity, was, commonly, identified, with, the, roman, god, sol, and, he, had, a, temple, dedicated, for, him, on, the, right, bank, of, the, tiber, since, the, second, century, also, he, bore, the, epithet, invictus, and, was, known, with, the, name, sol, sanctissimus, the, latter, was, an, epithet, aurelian, bore, on, an, inscription, from, capena, the, position, of, the, palmyrene, deity, as, aurelian, s, sol, invictus, is, inferred, from, a, passage, by, zosimus, reading, and, the, magnificent, temple, of, the, sun, he, i, e, aurelian, embellished, with, votive, gifts, from, palmyra, setting, up, statues, of, helios, and, bel, three, deities, from, palmyra, exemplified, solar, features, malakbel, yarhibol, and, ams, hence, the, identification, of, the, palmyrene, helios, appearing, in, zosimus, work, with, malakbel, some, scholars, criticize, the, notion, of, malakbel, s, identification, with, sol, invictus, according, to, gaston, halsberghe, the, cult, of, malakbel, was, too, local, for, it, to, become, an, imperial, roman, god, and, aurelian, s, restoration, of, bel, s, temple, and, sacrifices, dedicated, to, malakbel, were, a, sign, of, his, attachment, to, the, sun, god, in, general, and, his, respect, to, the, many, ways, in, which, the, deity, was, worshiped, richard, stoneman, suggested, another, approach, in, which, aurelian, simply, borrowed, the, imagery, of, malakbel, to, enhance, his, own, solar, deity, the, relation, between, malakbel, and, sol, invictus, can, not, be, confirmed, and, will, probably, remain, unresolved, palmyra, s, economy, before, and, at, the, beginning, of, the, roman, period, was, based, on, agriculture, pastoralism, and, trade, the, city, served, as, a, rest, station, for, the, caravans, which, sporadically, crossed, the, desert, by, the, end, of, the, first, century, bc, the, city, had, a, mixed, economy, based, on, agriculture, pastoralism, taxation, and, most, importantly, the, caravan, trade, taxation, was, an, important, source, of, revenue, for, the, palmyrene, government, caravaneers, paid, taxes, in, the, building, known, as, the, tariff, court, where, a, tax, law, dating, to, ad, 137, was, exhibited, the, law, regulated, the, tariffs, paid, by, the, merchants, for, goods, sold, at, the, internal, market, or, exported, from, the, city, the, classicist, andrew, m, smith, ii, suggested, that, most, land, in, palmyra, was, owned, by, the, city, which, collected, grazing, taxes, the, oasis, had, about, 1, 000, hectares, 2, 500, acres, of, irrigable, land, which, surrounded, the, city, the, palmyrenes, constructed, an, extensive, irrigation, system, in, the, northern, mountains, that, consisted, of, reservoirs, and, channels, to, capture, and, store, the, occasional, rainfall, the, most, notable, irrigation, work, is, harbaqa, dam, which, was, constructed, in, the, late, first, century, ad, it, is, located, 48, km, 30, mi,

although, evidence, is, lacking, it, is, possible, that, olive, trees, were, also, planted, and, dairy, products, were, produced, in, the, villages, it, is, also, apparent, that, barley, was, cultivated, however, agriculture, could, not, support, the, population, and, food, was, imported, after, palmyra, s, destruction, in, 273, it, became, a, market, for, villagers, and, nomads, from, the, surrounding, area, the, city, regained, some, of, its, prosperity, during, the, umayyad, era, indicated, by, the, discovery, of, a, large, umayyad, souq, in, the, colonnaded, street, palmyra, was, a, minor, trading, center, until, its, destruction, in, 1400, according, to, sharaf, ad, din, ali, yazdi, timur, s, men, took, 200, 000, sheep, and, the, city, was, reduced, into, a, settlement, on, the, desert, border, whose, inhabitants, herded, and, cultivated, small, plots, for, vegetables, and, corn, if, the, laghman, ii, inscription, in, afghanistan, is, referring, to, palmyra, then, the, city, s, role, in, central, asian, overland, trade, was, prominent, as, early, as, the, third, century, bc, during, the, first, centuries, ad, palmyra, s, main, trade, route, ran, east, to, the, euphrates, where, it, connected, at, the, city, of, h, t, the, route, then, ran, south, along, the, river, toward, the, port, of, charax, spasinu, on, the, persian, gulf, where, palmyrene, ships, traveled, back, and, forth, to, india, goods, were, imported, from, india, china, and, transoxiana, and, exported, west, to, emesa, or, antioch, then, the, mediterranean, ports, from, which, they, were, distributed, throughout, the, roman, empire, in, addition, to, the, usual, route, some, palmyrene, merchants, used, the, red, sea, probably, as, a, result, of, the, roman, parthian, wars, goods, were, carried, overland, from, the, seaports, to, a, nile, port, and, then, taken, to, the, egyptian, mediterranean, ports, for, export, inscriptions, attesting, a, palmyrene, presence, in, egypt,
