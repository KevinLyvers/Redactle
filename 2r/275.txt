https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonian_Avars
the, pannonian, avars, v, r, z, av, arz, were, an, alliance, of, several, groups, of, eurasian, nomads, of, various, origins, the, peoples, were, also, known, as, the, obri, in, chronicles, of, rus, the, abaroi, or, varchonitai, greek, romanized, varchon, tes, or, pseudo, avars, in, byzantine, sources, and, the, apar, old, turkic, to, the, g, kt, rks, kultegin, inscription, apar, avars, were, called, apar, they, established, the, avar, khaganate, which, spanned, the, pannonian, basin, and, considerable, areas, of, central, and, eastern, europe, from, the, late, 6th, to, the, early, 9th, century, the, name, pannonian, avars, after, the, area, in, which, they, settled, is, used, to, distinguish, them, from, the, avars, of, the, caucasus, a, separate, people, with, whom, the, pannonian, avars, may, or, may, not, have, had, links, although, the, name, avar, first, appeared, in, the, mid, 5th, century, the, pannonian, avars, entered, the, historical, scene, in, the, mid, 6th, century, on, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, as, a, people, who, wished, to, escape, the, rule, of, the, g, kt, rks, they, are, probably, best, known, for, their, invasions, and, destruction, in, the, avar, byzantine, wars, from, 568, to, 626, and, influence, on, the, slavic, migrations, to, southeastern, europe, recent, archaeogenetic, studies, indicate, that, the, pannonian, avars, were, of, primarily, ancient, northeast, asian, ancestry, similar, to, those, of, modern, day, people, from, mongolia, and, the, amur, river, region, in, manchuria, pointing, to, an, initial, rapid, migration, of, nomadic, tribes, into, the, centre, of, europe, from, the, eastern, eurasian, steppe, the, pannonian, avars, core, may, have, been, descended, from, the, remnants, of, the, rouran, khaganate, which, were, accompanied, by, other, steppe, groups, linguistic, evidence, suggests, that, the, later, avar, population, shifted, to, slavic, as, lingua, franca, the, earliest, clear, reference, to, the, avar, ethnonym, comes, from, priscus, the, rhetor, 420s, after, 472, who, recounts, that, in, c, 463, the, aragurs, and, onogurs, were, attacked, by, the, sabirs, who, had, been, attacked, by, the, avars, in, turn, the, avars, had, been, driven, off, by, people, fleeing, man, eating, griffins, coming, from, the, ocean, priscus, fr, 40, whilst, priscus, accounts, provide, some, information, about, the, ethno, political, situation, in, the, don, kuban, volga, region, after, the, demise, of, the, huns, no, unequivocal, conclusions, can, be, reached, denis, sinor, has, argued, that, whoever, the, avars, referred, to, by, priscus, were, they, differed, from, the, avars, who, appear, a, century, later, during, the, time, of, justinian, r, 527, 565, the, next, author, to, discuss, the, avars, menander, protector, appeared, during, the, 6th, century, and, wrote, of, g, kt, rk, embassies, to, constantinople, in, 565, and, 568, the, turks, appeared, angry, at, the, byzantines, for, having, made, an, alliance, with, the, avars, whom, the, turks, saw, as, their, subjects, and, slaves, turxanthos, a, turk, prince, calls, the, avars, varchonites, and, escaped, slaves, of, the, turks, who, numbered, about, 20, thousand, menander, fr, 43, many, more, but, somewhat, confusing, details, come, from, theophylact, simocatta, who, in, c, 629, describes, the, final, two, decades, of, the, 6th, century, in, particular, he, claims, to, quote, a, triumph, letter, from, turxanthos, for, this, very, chagan, had, in, fact, outfought, the, leader, of, the, nation, of, the, abdali, i, mean, indeed, of, the, hephthalites, as, they, are, called, conquered, him, and, assumed, the, rule, of, the, nation, then, he, enslaved, the, avar, nation, but, let, no, one, think, that, we, are, distorting, the, history, of, these, times, because, he, supposes, that, the, avars, are, those, barbarians, neighbouring, on, europe, and, pannonia, and, that, their, arrival, was, prior, to, the, times, of, the, emperor, maurice, for, it, is, by, a, misnomer, that, the, barbarians, on, the, ister, have, assumed, the, appellation, of, avars, the, origin, of, their, race, will, shortly, be, revealed, so, when, the, avars, had, been, defeated, for, we, are, returning, to, the, account, some, of, them, made, their, escape, to, those, who, inhabit, taugast, taugast, is, a, famous, city, which, is, a, total, of, one, thousand, five, hundred, miles, distant, from, those, who, are, called, turks, others, of, the, avars, who, declined, to, humbler, fortune, because, of, their, defeat, came, to, those, who, are, called, moukri, goguryeo, this, nation, is, the, closest, neighbour, to, the, men, of, taugast, then, the, chagan, embarked, on, yet, another, enterprise, and, subdued, all, the, ogur, which, is, one, of, the, strongest, tribes, on, account, of, its, large, population, and, its, armed, training, for, war, these, make, their, habitations, in, the, east, by, the, course, of, the, til, which, turks, are, accustomed, to, call, melas, the, earliest, leaders, of, this, nation, were, named, var, and, chunni, from, them, some, parts, of, those, nations, were, also, accorded, their, nomenclature, being, called, var, and, chunni, then, while, the, emperor, justinian, was, in, possession, of, the, royal, power, a, small, section, of, these, var, and, chunni, fled, from, that, ancestral, tribe, and, settled, in, europe, these, named, themselves, avars, and, glorified, their, leader, with, the, appellation, of, chagan, let, us, declare, without, departing, in, the, least, from, the, truth, how, the, means, of, changing, their, name, came, to, them, when, the, barsils, onogurs, sabirs, and, other, hun, nations, in, addition, to, these, saw, that, a, section, of, those, who, were, still, var, and, chunni, had, fled, to, their, regions, they, plunged, into, extreme, panic, since, they, suspected, that, the, settlers, were, avars, for, this, reason, they, honoured, the, fugitives, with, splendid, gifts, and, supposed, that, they, received, from, them, security, in, exchange, then, after, the, var, and, chunni, saw, the, well, omened, beginning, to, their, flight, they, appropriated, the, ambassadors, error, and, named, themselves, avars, for, among, the, scythian, nations, that, of, the, avars, is, said, to, be, the, most, adept, tribe, in, point, of, fact, even, up, to, our, present, times, the, pseudo, avars, for, it, is, more, correct, to, refer, to, them, thus, are, divided, in, their, ancestry, some, bearing, the, time, honoured, name, of, var, while, others, are, called, chunni, according, to, the, interpretation, of, dobrovits, and, nechaeva, the, turks, insisted, that, the, avars, were, only, pseudo, avars, so, as, to, boast, that, they, were, the, only, formidable, power, in, the, eurasian, steppe, the, g, kt, rks, claimed, that, the, real, avars, remained, loyal, subjects, of, the, turks, farther, east, a, political, name, a, par, was, indeed, mentioned, in, inscriptions, honoring, kul, tigin, and, bilge, qaghan, yet, in, armenian, sources, egishe, vardapet, ghazar, parpetsi, and, sebeos, apar, seemingly, indicated, a, geographical, area, khorasan, which, might, also, intimate, a, political, formation, once, there, additionally, apar, shar, that, is, the, country, of, the, apar, was, named, after, possibly, hephthalites, who, were, known, as, mc, u, t, ch, hu, in, chinese, sources, even, so, apar, could, not, be, linked, to, the, european, avars, notwithstanding, any, link, if, there, were, between, the, hephthalites, and, rourans, furthermore, dobrovits, has, questioned, the, authenticity, of, theophylact, s, account, as, such, he, has, argued, that, theophylact, borrowed, information, from, menander, s, accounts, of, byzantine, turk, negotiations, to, meet, political, needs, of, his, time, i, e, to, castigate, and, deride, the, avars, during, a, time, of, strained, political, relations, between, the, byzantines, and, avars, coinciding, with, emperor, maurice, s, northern, balkan, campaigns, paul, the, deacon, in, his, history, of, the, lombards, insisted, that, avars, were, known, previously, as, huns, and, he, conflated, the, two, groups, according, to, some, scholars, the, pannonian, avars, originated, from, a, confederation, formed, in, the, aral, sea, region, by, the, uar, also, known, as, the, ouar, warr, or, var, and, the, xionites, the, xionites, had, likely, been, speakers, of, iranian, and, or, turkic, languages, the, hephthalites, affiliated, previously, to, the, uar, and, xionites, had, remained, in, central, and, northern, south, asia, the, pannonian, avars, were, also, known, by, names, including, uarkhon, or, varchonites, which, may, have, been, a, portmanteau, combining, var, and, chunni, the, 18th, century, historian, joseph, de, guignes, postulates, a, link, between, the, avars, of, european, history, with, the, rouran, khaganate, of, inner, asia, based, on, a, coincidence, between, tardan, khan, s, letter, to, constantinople, and, events, recorded, in, chinese, sources, notably, the, wei, shu, and, bei, shi, chinese, sources, state, that, bumin, qaghan, founder, of, the, first, turkic, khaganate, defeated, the, rouran, some, of, whom, fled, and, joined, the, western, wei, later, bumin, s, successor, muqan, qaghan, defeated, the, hephthalites, as, well, as, the, turkic, tiele, superficially, these, victories, over, the, tiele, rouran, and, hephthalites, echo, a, narrative, in, the, theophylact, boasting, of, tardan, s, victories, over, the, hephthalites, avars, and, oghurs, however, the, two, series, of, events, are, not, synonymous, the, events, of, the, latter, took, place, during, tardan, s, rule, c, 580, 599, whilst, chinese, sources, referring, to, the, turk, defeat, of, the, rouran, and, other, central, asian, peoples, occurred, 50, years, earlier, at, the, founding, of, the, first, turkic, khaganate, it, is, for, this, reason, that, the, linguist, j, nos, harmatta, rejected, the, identification, of, the, avars, with, the, rouran, on, this, basis, according, to, edwin, g, pulleyblank, the, name, avar, is, the, same, as, the, prestigious, name, wuhuan, in, the, chinese, sources, several, historians, including, peter, benjamin, golden, suggest, that, the, avars, are, of, turkic, origin, likely, from, the, oghur, branch, another, theory, suggests, that, some, of, the, avars, were, of, tungusic, origin, a, study, by, emil, her, ak, and, ana, sili, 2002, suggests, that, the, avars, were, of, heterogeneous, origin, including, mostly, turkic, oghuric, and, mongolic, groups, later, in, europe, some, germanic, and, slavic, groups, were, assimilated, into, the, avars, her, ak, and, sili, concluded, that, their, exact, origin, is, unknown, but, stated, that, it, is, likely, that, the, avars, were, originally, mainly, composed, of, turkic, oghuric, tribes, increasing, evidence, supports, a, relationship, between, the, elite, of, the, pannonian, avars, and, the, inner, asian, rouran, khaganate, however, it, remains, unclear, to, what, extent, the, european, avars, descent, from, the, rouran, population, it, is, argued, that, the, initial, elite, core, of, the, pannonian, avars, spoke, a, para, mongolic, language, serbi, avar, which, is, a, sister, lineage, to, contemporary, mongolic, languages, in, 2003, walter, pohl, summarized, the, formation, of, nomadic, empires, 1, many, steppe, empires, were, founded, by, groups, who, had, been, defeated, in, previous, power, struggles, but, had, fled, from, the, dominion, of, the, stronger, group, the, avars, were, likely, a, losing, faction, previously, subordinate, to, the, legitimate, ashina, clan, in, the, western, turkic, khaganate, and, they, fled, west, of, the, dnieper, 2, these, groups, usually, were, of, mixed, origin, and, each, of, its, components, was, part, of, a, previous, group, 3, crucial, in, the, process, was, the, elevation, of, a, khagan, which, signified, a, claim, to, independent, power, and, an, expansionist, strategy, this, group, also, needed, a, new, name, that, would, give, all, of, its, initial, followers, a, sense, of, identity, 4, the, name, for, a, new, group, of, steppe, riders, was, often, taken, from, a, repertoire, of, prestigious, names, which, did, not, necessarily, denote, any, direct, affiliation, to, or, descent, from, groups, of, the, same, name, in, the, early, middle, ages, huns, avars, bulgars, and, ogurs, or, names, connected, with, o, gur, kutrigurs, utigurs, onogurs, etc, were, most, important, in, the, process, of, name, giving, both, perceptions, by, outsiders, and, self, designation, played, a, role, these, names, were, also, connected, with, prestigious, traditions, that, directly, expressed, political, pretensions, and, programmes, and, had, to, be, endorsed, by, success, in, the, world, of, the, steppe, where, agglomerations, of, groups, were, rather, fluid, it, was, vital, to, know, how, to, deal, with, a, newly, emergent, power, the, symbolical, hierarchy, of, prestige, expressed, through, names, provided, some, orientation, for, friend, and, foe, alike, such, views, are, mirrored, by, csan, d, b, lint, the, ethnogenesis, of, early, medieval, peoples, of, steppe, origin, cannot, be, conceived, in, a, single, linear, fashion, due, to, their, great, and, constant, mobility, with, no, ethnogenetic, point, zero, theoretical, proto, people, or, proto, language, moreover, avar, identity, was, strongly, linked, to, avar, political, institutions, groups, who, rebelled, or, fled, from, the, avar, realm, could, never, be, called, avars, but, were, rather, termed, bulgars, similarly, with, the, final, demise, of, avar, power, in, the, early, 9th, century, avar, identity, disappeared, almost, instantaneously, savelyev, and, jeong, 2020, in, early, nomads, of, the, eastern, steppe, and, their, tentative, connections, in, the, west, concluded, that, the, initial, pannonian, avars, formed, in, central, asia, from, various, ethno, linguistic, groups, including, iranian, peoples, ugrians, oghur, turks, and, rouran, tribes, they, further, note, that, the, broadly, east, asian, component, in, the, archaeological, record, of, the, european, avars, is, limited, even, in, the, earlier, period, of, their, history, elements, originating, from, west, asia, the, caucasus, the, southern, russian, steppes, and, the, local, central, european, cultures, can, be, traced, alongside, each, other, subsequent, analyses, from, 2022, on, avar, remains, however, confirmed, their, ancient, northeast, asian, origin, and, support, a, possible, ethnogenesis, of, the, avar, elite, from, the, former, rouran, khaganate, in, the, stuttgart, psalter, there, is, an, image, of, mounted, archers, riding, backwards, on, their, horses, a, noted, asian, tactic, which, may, depict, the, avars, according, to, mid, 20th, century, physical, anthropologists, such, as, p, l, lipt, k, human, remains, from, the, early, avar, 7th, century, period, had, mostly, europoid, features, while, grave, goods, indicated, cultural, links, to, the, eurasian, steppe, cemeteries, dated, to, the, late, avar, period, 8th, century, included, many, human, remains, with, physical, features, typical, of, east, asian, people, or, eurasians, i, e, people, with, both, east, asian, and, european, ancestry, remains, with, east, asian, or, eurasian, features, were, found, in, about, one, third, of, the, avar, graves, from, the, 8th, century, according, to, lipt, k, 79, of, the, population, of, the, danube, tisza, region, during, the, avar, period, showed, europoid, characteristics, however, lipt, k, used, racial, terms, later, deprecated, or, regarded, as, obsolete, such, as, mongoloid, for, northeast, asian, and, turanid, for, individuals, of, mixed, ancestry, several, theories, suggest, that, the, ruling, class, of, the, avars, were, of, northern, east, asian, origin, resembling, the, tungid, type, common, among, tungusic, speaking, peoples, a, genetic, study, published, in, scientific, reports, in, september, 2016, examined, the, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, of, 31, people, buried, in, the, carpathian, basin, between, the, 7th, and, 9th, centuries, they, were, found, to, be, mostly, carrying, european, haplogroups, such, as, h, k, t, and, u, while, about, 15, carried, asian, haplogroups, such, as, c, m6, d4c1, and, f1a, their, mtdna, were, found, to, be, primarily, characteristic, of, eastern, and, southern, europe, a, genetic, study, published, in, the, american, journal, of, physical, anthropology, in, 2018, examined, 62, individuals, buried, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, at, an, avar, slavic, burial, in, c, fer, p, c, slovakia, of, the, 46, samples, of, mtdna, extracted, 93, belonged, to, west, eurasian, lineages, while, 6, belonged, to, east, eurasian, lineages, the, amount, of, east, eurasian, lineages, was, higher, than, among, modern, european, populations, but, lower, than, what, has, been, found, in, other, genetic, studies, on, the, avars, the, mtdna, of, the, examined, individuals, was, found, to, be, quite, similar, to, medieval, and, modern, slavs, and, it, was, suggested, that, the, mixed, population, examined, had, emerged, through, intermarriage, between, avar, males, and, slavic, females, a, genetic, study, published, in, scientific, reports, in, november, 2019, examined, the, remains, of, fourteen, avar, males, eleven, of, them, were, dated, to, the, early, avar, period, and, three, were, dated, to, the, middle, and, late, avar, period, the, eleven, early, avar, males, were, found, to, be, carrying, the, paternal, haplogroups, n1a1a1a1a3, four, samples, n1a1a, two, samples, r1a1a1b2a, two, samples, c2, g2a, and, i1, the, three, males, dated, to, the, middle, and, late, avar, period, carried, the, paternal, haplogroups, c2, n1a1a1a1a3, and, e1b1b1a1b1a, in, short, most, carried, east, eurasian, y, haplogroups, typical, for, modern, north, eastern, siberian, and, buryat, populations, the, avars, studied, were, all, determined, to, have, had, dark, eyes, and, dark, hair, and, the, majority, of, them, were, found, to, be, primarily, of, east, asian, origin, a, genetic, study, published, in, scientific, reports, in, january, 2020, examined, the, remains, of, 26, individuals, buried, at, various, elite, avar, cemeteries, in, the, pannonian, basin, dated, to, the, 7th, century, the, mtdna, of, these, avars, belonged, mostly, to, east, asian, haplogroups, while, the, y, dna, was, exclusively, of, east, asian, origin, and, strikingly, homogenous, belonging, to, haplogroups, n, m231, and, q, m242, the, evidence, suggests, that, the, avar, elite, were, largely, patrilineal, and, endogamous, for, a, period, of, around, one, century, and, entered, the, pannonian, basin, through, migrations, from, east, asia, involving, both, men, and, women, another, 2020, study, but, of, xiongnu, remains, in, east, asia, found, that, the, xiongnu, shared, certain, paternal, n1a, q1a, r1a, z94, and, r1a, z2124, and, maternal, haplotypes, with, the, huns, and, avars, and, suggested, on, this, basis, that, they, were, descended, from, xiongnu, who, they, in, turn, suggested, were, descended, from, scytho, siberians, a, genetic, study, published, in, scientific, journal, cell, in, april, 2022, analyzed, 48, pannonian, avar, samples, from, the, early, middle, and, late, period, and, found, nearly, all, of, them, to, have, a, high, level, of, ancient, northeast, asian, ana, ancestry, the, paternal, lineage, n1a1a1a1a3a, f4205, was, most, common, with, q1a, q1b, r1a, r1b, and, e1b, subclades, present, in, smaller, numbers, the, samples, had, a, strong, affinity, with, modern, peoples, inhabiting, the, region, from, mongolia, to, the, amur, with, a, historical, rouran, khaganate, sample, and, with, samples, from, xiongnu, xianbei, periods, in, the, eastern, asian, steppe, the, avar, individuals, showed, their, highest, genetic, affinity, with, present, day, mongolic, and, tungusic, peoples, as, well, as, nivkhs, a, genetic, study, published, in, scientific, journal, current, biology, in, may, 2022, examined, 143, avar, samples, from, various, periods, including, avar, elites, and, local, commoners, it, confirmed, the, ancient, northeast, asian, ana, paternal, and, maternal, origin, for, the, avar, elite, with, n1a, f4205, being, their, predominant, and, characteristic, paternal, lineage, alongside, incorporated, q1a2a1, and, r1a, z94, hunnic, iranian, remnants, and, the, rest, belonging, to, local, haplogroups, found, among, surrounding, populations, autosomally, the, elite, avar, samples, preserved, very, ancient, mongolian, pre, bronze, age, genomes, with, ca, 90, ancestry, shared, deep, ancestry, with, european, huns, but, although, since, early, avar, period, started, mixing, with, local, and, immigrant, hunnic, iranian, related, populations, people, with, different, genetic, ancestries, were, seemingly, distinguished, as, samples, with, hun, related, genomes, were, buried, in, separate, cemeteries, the, majority, of, the, avar, khaganate, general, population, consisted, of, local, european, peoples, eu, core, but, did, not, display, northeast, asian, admixture, supporting, a, model, of, elite, dominance, of, arriving, horse, nomads, over, a, large, sedentary, population, with, at, least, some, subsequent, admixture, events, genetic, data, on, later, avar, elite, samples, showed, continuity, with, earlier, avars, and, the, long, term, presence, of, northeast, asian, ancestry, among, the, avar, elite, suggesting, a, possible, endogamous, social, system, there, was, however, an, increase, of, northeast, asian, and, saka, associated, ancestry, among, the, total, population, suggesting, either, further, migration, from, the, eurasian, steppe, and, admixture, between, local, and, avar, groups, or, substructure, among, the, overall, population, not, observed, before, in, 557, the, avars, sent, an, embassy, to, constantinople, presumably, from, the, northern, caucasus, this, marked, their, first, contact, with, the, byzantine, empire, in, exchange, for, gold, they, agreed, to, subjugate, the, unruly, gentes, on, behalf, of, the, byzantines, subsequently, they, conquered, and, incorporated, various, nomadic, tribes, kutrigurs, and, sabirs, and, defeated, the, antes, pohl, 1998, p, 18, the, first, thing, the, avars, did, when, they, came, near, the, caucasus, on, their, flight, from, central, asia, was, to, send, an, embassy, to, the, aging, emperor, justinian, that, took, place, sometime, in, winter, 558, 59, and, they, struck, the, usual, deal, the, avars, were, to, fight, for, the, empire, against, unruly, gentes, and, in, turn, would, receive, annual, payments, and, other, benefits, indeed, for, 20, years, to, come, the, avars, under, their, khagan, baian, fought, utigurs, and, antes, gepids, and, slavs, whereas, their, policy, towards, the, empire, relied, more, on, negotiation, than, on, war, by, 562, the, avars, controlled, the, lower, danube, basin, and, the, steppes, north, of, the, black, sea, by, the, time, they, arrived, in, the, balkans, the, avars, formed, a, heterogeneous, group, of, about, 20, 000, horsemen, after, the, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, bought, them, off, they, pushed, northwestwards, into, germania, however, frankish, opposition, halted, the, avars, expansion, in, that, direction, seeking, rich, pastoral, lands, the, avars, initially, demanded, land, south, of, the, danube, in, present, day, bulgaria, but, the, byzantines, refused, using, their, contacts, with, the, g, kt, rks, as, a, threat, against, avar, aggression, the, avars, turned, their, attention, to, the, carpathian, basin, and, to, the, natural, defenses, it, afforded, the, carpathian, basin, was, occupied, by, the, gepids, in, 567, the, avars, formed, an, alliance, with, the, lombards, enemies, of, the, gepids, and, together, they, destroyed, much, of, the, gepid, kingdom, the, avars, then, persuaded, the, lombards, to, move, into, northern, italy, an, invasion, that, marked, the, last, germanic, mass, movement, in, the, migration, period, continuing, their, successful, policy, of, turning, the, various, barbarians, against, each, other, the, byzantines, persuaded, the, avars, to, attack, the, sclavenes, in, scythia, minor, a, land, rich, with, goods, after, devastating, much, of, the, sclavenes, land, the, avars, returned, to, pannonia, after, many, of, the, khagan, s, subjects, deserted, to, the, byzantine, emperor, by, about, 580, the, avar, khagan, bayan, i, had, established, supremacy, over, most, of, the, slavic, germanic, and, bulgar, tribes, living, in, pannonia, and, the, carpathian, basin, when, the, byzantine, empire, was, unable, to, pay, subsidies, or, hire, avar, mercenaries, the, avars, raided, their, balkan, territories, according, to, menander, bayan, i, commanded, an, army, of, 10, 000, kutrigur, bulgars, and, sacked, dalmatia, in, 568, effectively, cutting, the, byzantine, terrestrial, link, with, northern, italy, and, western, europe, in, the, 580s, and, 590s, many, of, the, imperial, armies, were, busy, fighting, the, persians, and, the, remaining, troops, in, the, balkans, were, no, match, for, the, avars, by, 582, the, avars, had, captured, sirmium, an, important, fort, in, pannonia, when, the, byzantines, refused, to, increase, the, stipend, amount, as, requested, by, bayan, s, son, and, successor, bayan, ii, the, avars, proceeded, to, capture, singidunum, belgrade, and, viminacium, they, suffered, setbacks, however, during, maurice, s, balkan, campaigns, in, the, 590s, by, 600, the, avars, had, established, a, nomadic, empire, ruling, over, a, multitude, of, peoples, and, stretching, from, modern, austria, in, the, west, to, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, in, the, east, after, being, defeated, at, the, battles, of, viminacium, in, their, homeland, some, avars, defected, to, the, byzantines, in, 602, but, emperor, maurice, decided, not, to, return, home, as, was, customary, he, maintained, his, army, camp, beyond, the, danube, throughout, the, winter, but, the, hardship, caused, the, army, to, revolt, giving, the, avars, a, desperately, needed, respite, and, they, attempted, an, invasion, of, northern, italy, in, 610, the, byzantine, civil, war, prompted, a, persian, invasion, in, the, byzantine, sasanian, war, and, after, 615, the, avars, enjoyed, a, free, hand, in, the, undefended, balkans, while, negotiating, with, emperor, heraclius, beneath, the, walls, of, constantinople, in, 617, the, avars, launched, a, surprise, attack, while, they, were, unable, to, capture, the, city, centre, they, pillaged, the, suburbs, and, took, 270, 000, captives, payments, in, gold, and, goods, to, the, avars, reached, a, sum, of, 200, 000, solidi, shortly, before, 626, in, 626, the, avars, cooperated, with, the, sassanid, force, in, the, failed, siege, of, 626, following, this, defeat, the, political, and, military, power, of, the, avars, declined, byzantine, and, frankish, sources, documented, a, war, between, the, avars, and, their, western, slav, clients, the, wends, each, year, the, huns, came, to, the, slavs, to, spend, the, winter, with, them, then, they, took, the, wives, and, daughters, of, the, slavs, and, slept, with, them, and, among, the, other, mistreatments, the, slavs, were, also, forced, to, pay, levies, to, the, huns, but, the, sons, of, the, huns, who, were, raised, with, the, wives, and, daughters, of, these, wends, could, not, finally, endure, this, oppression, anymore, and, refused, obedience, to, the, huns, and, began, as, already, mentioned, a, rebellion, when, now, the, wendish, army, went, against, the, huns, the, merchant, samo, accompanied, the, same, and, so, samo, s, bravery, proved, itself, in, wonderful, ways, and, a, huge, mass, of, huns, fell, to, the, sword, of, the, wends, in, the, 630s, samo, the, ruler, of, the, first, slavic, polity, known, as, samo, s, tribal, union, or, samo, s, realm, increased, his, authority, over, lands, to, the, north, and, west, of, the, khaganate, at, the, expense, of, the, avars, ruling, until, his, death, in, 658, the, chronicle, of, fredegar, records, that, during, samo, s, rebellion, in, 631, 9, 000, bulgars, led, by, alciocus, left, pannonia, to, modern, day, bavaria, where, dagobert, i, massacred, most, of, them, the, remaining, 700, joined, the, wends, at, about, the, time, of, samo, s, realm, bulgar, leader, kubrat, of, the, dulo, clan, led, a, successful, uprising, to, end, avar, authority, over, the, pannonian, plain, establishing, old, great, bulgaria, or, patria, onoguria, the, homeland, of, onogurs, the, civil, war, possibly, a, succession, struggle, in, onoguria, between, the, kutrigurs, under, alciocus, on, one, side, and, utigur, forces, on, the, other, raged, from, 631, to, 632, after, alciocus, fled, to, bavaria, the, power, of, the, avars, kutrigur, forces, was, shattered, and, kubrat, established, peace, between, the, avars, and, byzantium, in, 632, according, to, constantine, vii, s, 10th, century, work, de, administrando, imperio, a, group, of, croats, who, had, separated, from, the, white, croats, in, white, croatia, had, also, fought, against, the, avars, after, which, they, organized, the, duchy, of, croatia, the, unknown, archon, s, people, from, samo, s, realm, were, also, resettled, at, this, time, with, the, death, of, samo, in, 658, and, kubrat, in, 665, some, slavic, tribes, again, came, under, avar, rule, despite, their, father, s, advice, kubrat, s, sons, failed, to, maintain, cohesion, in, old, great, bulgaria, which, began, to, disintegrate, a, few, years, later, in, the, time, of, batbayan, old, great, bulgaria, dissolved, into, five, branches, from, western, onoguria, the, first, group, of, folk, moved, to, ravenna, under, alzeco, in, the, 650s, according, to, book, ii, of, the, miracles, of, saint, demetrius, a, certain, avar, chagan, seized, his, opportunity, to, coalesce, in, the, regions, further, north, in, response, to, the, secession, of, the, diocese, of, sirmium, in, the, 670s, by, a, kuber, chagan, about, this, time, mark, of, kalt, records, that, in, 677, the, principality, of, ungvar, ung, fortress, was, established, in, the, regions, further, north, where, kotrag, s, group, also, fled, following, the, chaos, and, a, third, group, of, onogur, bulgarians, led, by, batayan, was, subdued, by, ziebel, s, emerging, khazar, empire, according, to, nikephoros, i, of, constantinople, under, mauros, a, fourth, group, of, folk, eventually, settled, in, the, present, day, region, of, north, macedonia, the, fifth, group, from, onogur, bulgaria, led, by, khan, asparukh, the, father, of, khan, tervel, settled, permanently, along, the, danube, c, 679, 681, establishing, the, first, bulgarian, empire, stabilized, by, the, victory, at, the, battle, of, ongal, south, of, the, eastern, carpathians, the, bulgarians, turned, on, byzantium, who, had, established, an, alliance, with, ziebel, s, khazars, although, the, avar, empire, had, diminished, to, half, its, original, size, the, avar, slav, alliance, consolidated, their, rule, west, from, the, central, parts, of, the, mid, danubian, basin, and, extended, their, sphere, of, influence, west, to, the, vienna, basin, the, new, ethnic, element, marked, by, hair, clips, for, pigtails, curved, single, edged, sabres, and, broad, symmetrical, bows, marks, the, middle, avar, bulgar, period, 670, 720, new, regional, centers, such, as, those, near, ozora, and, igar, appeared, this, strengthened, the, avars, power, base, although, most, of, the, balkans, lay, in, the, hands, of, slavic, tribes, since, neither, the, avars, nor, byzantines, were, able, to, reassert, control, there, are, very, few, sources, that, cover, the, last, century, of, avar, history, they, only, talk, about, the, relations, between, the, avars, and, lombards, but, little, about, the, internals, of, the, khaganate, so, information, about, the, carpathian, basin, is, mostly, from, archaeology, even, here, elites, are, almost, invisible, and, there, is, little, evidence, of, nomadic, behavior, this, transformation, is, little, understood, but, may, have, something, to, do, with, population, growth, a, new, type, of, ceramics, the, so, called, dev, nska, nov, ves, pottery, emerged, at, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, in, the, region, between, the, middle, danube, and, the, carpathians, these, vessels, were, similar, to, the, hand, made, pottery, of, the, previous, period, but, wheel, made, items, were, also, found, in, dev, nska, nov, ves, sites, large, inhumation, cemeteries, found, at, holiare, nov, z, mky, and, other, places, in, slovakia, hungary, and, serbia, from, the, period, beginning, around, 690, show, that, the, settlement, network, of, the, carpathian, basin, became, more, stable, in, the, late, avar, period, the, most, popular, late, avar, motifs, griffins, and, tendrils, decorating, belts, mounts, and, a, number, of, other, artifacts, connected, to, warriors, may, either, represent, nostalgia, for, the, lost, nomadic, past, or, evidence, a, new, wave, of, nomads, arriving, from, the, pontic, steppes, at, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, according, to, historians, who, accept, the, latter, theory, the, immigrants, may, have, been, either, onogurs, or, alans, anthropological, studies, of, the, skeletons, point, at, the, presence, of, a, population, with, mongoloid, features, the, khaganate, in, the, middle, and, late, periods, was, a, product, of, cultural, symbiosis, between, slavic, and, original, avar, elements, with, a, slavic, language, as, a, lingua, franca, or, the, most, common, language, in, the, 7th, century, the, avar, khaganate, opened, a, door, for, slavic, demographic, and, linguistic, expansion, to, adriatic, and, aegean, regions, see, slavic, migrations, to, southeastern, europe, in, the, early, 8th, century, a, new, archaeological, culture, the, so, called, griffin, and, tendril, culture, appeared, in, the, carpathian, basin, some, theories, including, the, double, conquest, theory, of, archaeologist, gyula, l, szl, attribute, it, to, the, arrival, of, new, settlers, such, as, early, magyars, but, this, is, still, under, debate, hungarian, archaeologists, laszl, makkai, and, andr, s, m, csy, attribute, this, culture, to, an, internal, evolution, of, avars, resulting, from, the, integration, of, the, bulgar, migr, s, from, the, previous, generation, of, the, 670s, according, to, makkai, and, m, csy, the, material, culture, art, clothing, equipment, weapons, of, the, late, avar, bulgar, period, evolved, autonomously, from, these, new, foundations, many, regions, that, had, once, been, important, centers, of, the, avar, empire, had, lost, their, significance, while, new, ones, arose, although, avaric, material, culture, found, over, much, of, the, northern, balkans, may, indicate, an, existing, avar, presence, it, probably, represents, the, presence, of, independent, slavs, who, had, adopted, avaric, customs, radovan, bunard, i, dated, avar, bulgar, graves, excavated, in, elarevo, near, sirmium, containing, skulls, with, mongolian, features, and, judaic, symbols, to, the, late, 8th, century, and, 9th, century, the, gradual, decline, of, avar, power, accelerated, to, a, rapid, fall, a, series, of, frankish, campaigns, beginning, from, 788, ended, with, the, conquest, of, the, avar, realm, within, a, decade, initial, conflict, between, avars, and, franks, occurred, soon, after, the, frankish, deposition, of, bavarian, duke, tassilo, iii, and, the, establishment, of, direct, frankish, rule, over, bavaria, in, 788, at, that, time, the, border, between, bavarians, and, avars, was, situated, on, the, river, enns, an, initial, avarian, incursion, into, bavaria, was, repelled, and, franco, bavarian, forces, responded, by, taking, the, war, to, neighbouring, avarian, territories, situated, along, the, danube, east, of, enns, the, two, sides, collided, near, the, river, ybbs, on, ybbs, field, german, ybbsfeld, where, the, avars, suffered, a, defeat, in, 788, this, heralded, the, rise, of, frankish, power, and, avarian, decline, in, the, region, in, 790, the, avars, tried, to, negotiate, a, peace, settlement, with, the, franks, but, no, agreement, was, reached, a, frankish, campaign, against, the, avars, initiated, in, 791, ended, successfully, for, the, franks, a, large, frankish, army, led, by, charlemagne, crossed, from, bavaria, into, the, avarian, territory, beyond, the, enns, and, started, to, advance, along, the, danube, in, two, columns, but, found, no, resistance, and, soon, reached, the, region, of, the, vienna, woods, near, the, pannonian, plain, no, pitched, battle, was, fought, since, the, avars, had, fled, before, the, advancing, carolingian, army, while, disease, left, most, of, the, avar, horses, dead, tribal, infighting, began, showing, the, weakness, of, the, khaganate, the, franks, had, been, supported, by, the, slavs, who, established, polities, on, former, avar, territory, charlemagne, s, son, pepin, of, italy, captured, a, large, fortified, encampment, known, as, the, ring, which, contained, much, of, the, spoils, from, earlier, avar, campaigns, the, campaign, against, the, avars, again, gathered, momentum, by, 796, the, avar, chieftains, had, surrendered, and, became, open, to, the, acceptance, of, christianity, in, the, meantime, all, of, pannonia, was, conquered, according, to, the, annales, regni, francorum, the, avars, began, to, submit, to, the, franks, in, 796, the, song, de, pippini, regis, victoria, avarica, celebrating, the, defeat, of, the, avars, at, the, hands, of, pepin, of, italy, in, 796, still, survives, the, franks, baptized, many, avars, and, integrated, them, into, the, frankish, empire, in, 799, some, avars, revolted, in, 804, bulgaria, conquered, the, southeastern, avar, lands, in, transylvania, and, southeastern, pannonia, up, to, the, middle, danube, and, many, avars, became, subjects, of, the, bulgarian, empire, khagan, theodorus, a, convert, to, christianity, died, after, asking, charlemagne, for, help, in, 805, he, was, succeeded, by, khagan, abraham, who, was, baptized, as, the, new, frankish, client, and, should, not, be, assumed, from, his, name, alone, to, have, been, khavar, rather, than, pseudo, avar, abraham, was, succeeded, by, khagan, or, tudun, isaac, latin, canizauci, about, whom, little, is, known, the, franks, turned, the, avar, lands, under, their, control, into, a, frontier, march, the, march, of, pannonia, the, eastern, half, of, the, avar, march, was, then, granted, to, the, slavic, prince, pribina, who, established, the, lower, pannonia, principality, in, 840, whatever, was, left, of, avar, power, was, effectively, ended, when, the, bulgars, expanded, their, territory, into, the, central, and, eastern, portions, of, traditional, avar, lands, around, 829, according, to, pohl, an, avar, presence, in, pannonia, is, certain, in, 871, but, thereafter, the, name, is, no, longer, used, by, chroniclers, pohl, wrote, it, simply, proved, impossible, to, keep, up, an, avar, identity, after, avar, institutions, and, the, high, claims, of, their, tradition, had, failed, although, regino, wrote, about, them, in, 889, the, growing, amount, of, archaeological, evidence, in, transdanubia, also, presumes, an, avar, population, in, the, carpathian, basin, in, the, late, 9th, century, archaeological, findings, suggest, a, substantial, late, avar, presence, on, the, great, hungarian, plain, however, it, is, difficult, to, determine, their, proper, chronology, the, preliminary, results, of, the, new, excavations, also, imply, that, the, known, and, largely, accepted, theory, of, the, destruction, of, the, avar, settlement, area, is, outdated, a, disastrous, depopulation, of, the, avar, khaganate, never, happened, byzantine, records, including, the, notitia, episcopatuum, the, additio, patriarchicorum, thronorum, by, neilos, doxapatres, the, chronica, by, petrus, alexandrinus, and, the, notitia, patriarchatuum, mention, the, 9th, century, avars, as, an, existing, christian, population, the, avars, had, already, been, mixing, with, the, more, numerous, slavs, for, generations, and, they, later, came, under, the, rule, of, external, polities, such, as, the, franks, bulgaria, and, great, moravia, fine, presumes, that, avar, descendants, who, survived, the, hungarian, conquest, in, the, 890s, were, likely, absorbed, by, the, hungarian, population, after, the, mid, to, late, 8th, century, frankish, conquest, of, pannonia, avar, and, bulgar, refugees, migrated, to, settle, in, the, area, of, bulgaria, and, along, its, western, periphery, the, avars, in, the, region, known, as, solitudo, avarorum, currently, called, the, great, hungarian, plain, vanished, in, an, arc, of, three, generations, they, slowly, merged, with, the, slavs, to, create, a, bilingual, turkic, slavic, speaking, people, who, were, subjected, to, frankish, domination, the, invading, magyars, found, this, composite, people, in, the, late, 9th, century, the, de, administrando, imperio, written, around, 950, and, based, on, older, documents, states, that, there, are, still, descendants, of, the, avars, in, croatia, and, are, recognized, as, avars, modern, historians, and, archaeologists, until, now, proved, the, opposite, that, avars, never, lived, in, dalmatia, proper, including, lika, that, statement, occurred, somewhere, in, pannonia, and, the, information, belongs, to, the, 9th, century, there, has, been, speculation, that, the, modern, avar, people, of, the, caucasus, might, have, an, uncertain, connection, to, the, historical, avars, but, direct, descent, from, them, is, rejected, or, doubted, by, many, scholars, the, recorded, avar, khagans, were, the, pannonian, basin, was, the, centre, of, the, avar, power, base, the, avars, resettled, captives, from, the, peripheries, of, their, empire, to, more, central, regions, avar, material, culture, is, found, south, to, macedonia, however, to, the, east, of, the, carpathians, there, are, next, to, no, avar, archaeological, finds, suggesting, that, they, lived, mainly, in, the, western, balkans, scholars, propose, that, a, highly, structured, and, hierarchical, avar, society, existed, having, complex, interactions, with, other, barbarian, groups, the, khagan, was, the, paramount, figure, surrounded, by, a, minority, of, nomadic, aristocracy, a, few, exceptionally, rich, burials, have, been, uncovered, confirming, that, power, was, limited, to, the, khagan, and, a, close, knit, class, of, elite, warriors, in, addition, to, hoards, of, gold, coins, that, accompanied, the, burials, the, men, were, often, buried, with, symbols, of, rank, such, as, decorated, belts, weapons, stirrups, resembling, those, found, in, central, asia, as, well, as, their, horse, the, avar, army, was, composed, from, numerous, other, groups, slavic, gepidic, and, bulgar, military, units, there, also, appeared, to, have, existed, semi, independent, client, predominantly, slavic, tribes, which, served, strategic, roles, such, as, engaging, in, diversionary, attacks, and, guarding, the, avars, western, borders, abutting, the, frankish, empire, initially, the, avars, and, their, subjects, lived, separately, except, for, slavic, and, germanic, women, who, married, avar, men, eventually, the, germanic, and, slavic, peoples, were, included, in, the, avaric, social, order, and, culture, which, was, persian, byzantine, in, fashion, scholars, have, identified, a, fused, avar, slavic, culture, characterized, by, ornaments, such, as, half, moon, shaped, earrings, byzantine, styled, buckles, beads, and, bracelets, with, horn, shaped, ends, paul, fouracre, notes, here, appears, in, the, seventh, century, a, mixed, slavic, avar, material, culture, interpreted, as, peaceful, and, harmonious, relationships, between, avar, warriors, and, slavic, peasants, it, is, thought, possible, that, at, least, some, of, the, leaders, of, the, slavic, tribes, could, have, become, part, of, the, avar, aristocracy, apart, from, the, assimilated, gepids, a, few, graves, of, carolingian, peoples, have, been, found, in, the, avar, lands, they, perhaps, served, as, mercenaries, the, language, or, languages, spoken, by, the, avars, are, unknown, classical, philologist, samu, sz, deczky, kardoss, states, that, most, of, the, avar, words, used, in, contemporaneous, latin, or, greek, texts, appear, to, have, their, origins, in, possibly, mongolian, or, turkic, languages, other, theories, propose, a, tungusic, origin, according, to, sz, deczky, kardoss, many, of, the, titles, and, ranks, used, by, the, pannonian, avars, were, also, used, by, turks, proto, bulgars, uighurs, and, or, mongols, including, khagan, or, kagan, khan, kapkhan, tudun, tarkhan, and, khatun, there, is, also, evidence, however, that, ruling, and, subject, clans, spoke, a, variety, of, languages, proposals, by, scholars, include, caucasian, iranian, tungusic, hungarian, and, turkic, a, few, scholars, speculated, that, proto, slavic, became, the, lingua, franca, of, the, avar, khaganate, historian, gyula, l, szl, has, suggested, that, the, late, 9th, century, pannonian, avars, spoke, a, variety, of, old, hungarian, thereby, forming, an, avar, hungarian, continuity, with, then, newly, arrived, hungarians, based, on, archeologic, and, linguistic, data, florin, curta, and, johanna, nichols, concluded, that, there, is, no, convincing, evidence, for, the, presence, of, any, turkic, or, mongolic, languages, among, the, avars, but, evidence, for, the, presence, of, iranian, languages, further, strengthened, by, iranian, derived, loanwords, and, toponyms, in, the, region, and, among, languages, within, the, range, of, the, avars, shimunek, 2017, proposes, that, the, elite, core, of, the, avars, spoke, a, para, mongolic, language, of, the, serbi, awar, group, that, is, a, sister, branch, of, the, mongolic, languages, together, the, serbi, awar, and, mongolic, languages, make, up, the, serbi, mongolic, languages, the, avars, were, skilled, warriors, and, almost, exclusively, fought, on, horseback, they, often, used, light, horse, archers, armed, with, powerful, composite, bows, as, many, other, steppe, peoples, these, archers, wore, little, to, no, armour, besides, occasional, helmets, or, knee, guards, the, avars, also, employed, the, use, of, heavy, cavalry, fully, armoured, in, chainmail, or, scale, armour, as, well, as, helmets, these, heavier, troops, were, armed, with, long, lances, swords, and, daggers, upon, subjugating, the, slavic, tribes, in, pannonia, they, often, allied, with, the, slavs, and, employed, them, as, foot, soldiers, even, together, laying, siege, to, constantinople, along, with, large, numbers, of, persians, these, slav, warriors, were, usually, armed, with, bows, axes, various, types, of, spears, and, round, shields, the, byzantine, emperor, maurice, wrote, of, the, avars, and, other, nomad, peoples, in, the, strategikon, they, give, special, attention, to, training, in, archery, on, horseback, a, vast, herd, of, male, and, female, horses, follows, them, both, to, provide, nourishment, and, to, give, the, impression, of, a, huge, army, they, do, not, encamp, within, entrenchments, as, do, the, persians, and, the, romans, but, until, the, day, of, battle, spread, about, according, to, tribes, and, clans, they, continuously, graze, their, horses, both, summer, and, winter, also, in, the, event, of, battle, when, opposed, by, an, infantry, force, in, close, formation, they, stay, on, their, horses, and, do, not, dismount, for, they, do, not, last, long, fighting, on, foot, they, have, been, brought, up, on, horseback, and, owing, to, their, lack, of, exercise, they, simply, cannot, walk, about, on, their, own, feet, gyula, l, szl, suggests, that, late, avars, arriving, to, the, khaganate, in, 670, in, great, numbers, lived, through, the, time, between, the, destruction, and, plunder, of, the, avar, state, by, the, franks, during, 791, 795, and, the, arrival, of, the, magyars, in, 895, l, szl, points, out, that, the, settlements, of, the, hungarians, magyars, complemented, rather, than, replaced, those, of, the, avars, avars, remained, on, the, plough, fields, good, for, agriculture, while, hungarians, took, the, river, banks, and, river, flats,
