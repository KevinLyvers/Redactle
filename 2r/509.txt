britain, the, netherlands, and, russia, due, to, american, pressure, these, treaties, signed, with, western, powers, came, to, be, known, as, unequal, treaties, as, japan, lost, control, over, its, tariffs, while, western, powers, took, control, over, japanese, lands, in, 1858, townsend, harris, ambassador, to, japan, concluded, the, treaty, opening, japanese, ports, to, trade, figures, like, shimazu, nariakira, concluded, that, if, we, take, the, initiative, we, can, dominate, if, we, do, not, we, will, be, dominated, leading, japan, to, throw, open, its, doors, to, foreign, technology, after, the, humiliation, of, the, unequal, treaties, the, leaders, of, the, meiji, restoration, as, this, revolution, came, to, be, known, acted, in, the, name, of, restoring, imperial, rule, to, strengthen, japan, against, the, threat, of, being, colonized, bringing, to, an, end, the, era, known, as, sakoku, the, word, meiji, means, enlightened, rule, and, the, goal, was, to, combine, modern, advances, with, traditional, eastern, values, wakonyosai, the, main, leaders, of, this, were, it, hirobumi, matsukata, masayoshi, kido, takayoshi, itagaki, taisuke, yamagata, aritomo, mori, arinori, kubo, toshimichi, and, yamaguchi, naoyoshi, the, foundation, of, the, meiji, restoration, was, the, 1866, satsuma, ch, sh, alliance, between, saig, takamori, and, kido, takayoshi, leaders, of, the, reformist, elements, in, the, satsuma, and, ch, sh, domains, at, the, southwestern, end, of, the, japanese, archipelago, these, two, leaders, supported, the, emperor, k, mei, emperor, meiji, s, father, and, were, brought, together, by, sakamoto, ry, ma, for, the, purpose, of, challenging, the, ruling, tokugawa, shogunate, bakufu, and, restoring, the, emperor, to, power, after, k, mei, s, death, on, 30, january, 1867, meiji, ascended, the, throne, on, february, 3, this, period, also, saw, japan, change, from, being, a, feudal, society, to, having, a, centralized, nation, and, left, the, japanese, with, a, lingering, influence, of, modernity, in, the, same, year, the, koban, was, discontinued, as, a, form, of, currency, the, tokugawa, government, had, been, founded, in, the, 17th, century, and, initially, focused, on, reestablishing, order, in, social, political, and, international, affairs, after, a, century, of, warfare, the, political, structure, established, by, tokugawa, ieyasu, and, solidified, under, his, two, immediate, successors, his, son, tokugawa, hidetada, who, ruled, from, 1616, to, 1623, and, grandson, tokugawa, iemitsu, 1623, 51, bound, all, daimy, s, to, the, shogunate, and, limited, any, individual, daimy, from, acquiring, too, much, land, or, power, the, tokugawa, shogunate, came, to, its, official, end, on, 9, november, 1867, when, tokugawa, yoshinobu, the, 15th, tokugawa, sh, gun, put, his, prerogatives, at, the, emperor, s, disposal, and, resigned, 10, days, later, this, was, effectively, the, restoration, taisei, h, kan, of, imperial, rule, although, yoshinobu, still, had, significant, influence, and, it, was, not, until, january, 3, the, following, year, with, the, young, emperor, s, edict, that, the, restoration, fully, occurred, on, 3, january, 1868, the, emperor, stripped, yoshinobu, of, all, power, and, made, a, formal, declaration, of, the, restoration, of, his, power, the, emperor, of, japan, announces, to, the, sovereigns, of, all, foreign, countries, and, to, their, subjects, that, permission, has, been, granted, to, the, sh, gun, tokugawa, yoshinobu, to, return, the, governing, power, in, accordance, with, his, own, request, we, shall, henceforward, exercise, supreme, authority, in, all, the, internal, and, external, affairs, of, the, country, consequently, the, title, of, emperor, must, be, substituted, for, that, of, taikun, in, which, the, treaties, have, been, made, officers, are, being, appointed, by, us, to, the, conduct, of, foreign, affairs, it, is, desirable, that, the, representatives, of, the, treaty, powers, recognize, this, announcement, shortly, thereafter, in, january, 1868, the, boshin, war, started, with, the, battle, of, toba, fushimi, in, which, ch, sh, and, satsuma, s, forces, defeated, the, ex, sh, gun, s, army, all, tokugawa, lands, were, seized, and, placed, under, imperial, control, thus, placing, them, under, the, prerogative, of, the, new, meiji, government, with, fuhanken, sanchisei, the, areas, were, split, into, three, types, urban, prefectures, fu, rural, prefectures, ken, and, the, already, existing, domains, on, march, 23, the, dutch, minister, resident, dirk, de, graeff, van, polsbroek, and, the, french, minister, resident, l, on, roches, were, the, first, european, envoys, ever, to, receive, a, personal, audience, with, meiji, in, edo, tokyo, this, audience, laid, the, foundation, for, modern, dutch, diplomacy, in, japan, subsequently, de, graeff, van, polsbroek, assisted, the, emperor, and, the, government, in, their, negotiations, with, representatives, of, the, major, european, powers, in, 1869, the, daimy, s, of, the, tosa, hizen, satsuma, and, ch, sh, domains, who, were, pushing, most, fiercely, against, the, shogunate, were, persuaded, to, return, their, domains, to, the, emperor, other, daimy, were, subsequently, persuaded, to, do, so, thus, creating, a, central, government, in, japan, which, exercised, direct, power, through, the, entire, realm, some, shogunate, forces, escaped, to, hokkaid, where, they, attempted, to, set, up, a, breakaway, republic, of, ezo, however, forces, loyal, to, the, emperor, ended, this, attempt, in, may, 1869, with, the, battle, of, hakodate, in, hokkaid, the, defeat, of, the, armies, of, the, former, sh, gun, led, by, enomoto, takeaki, and, hijikata, toshiz, marked, the, final, end, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, with, the, emperor, s, power, fully, restored, finally, by, 1872, the, daimy, s, past, and, present, were, summoned, before, the, emperor, where, it, was, declared, that, all, domains, were, now, to, be, returned, to, the, emperor, the, roughly, 280, domains, were, turned, into, 72, prefectures, each, under, the, control, of, a, state, appointed, governor, if, the, daimy, s, peacefully, complied, they, were, given, a, prominent, voice, in, the, new, meiji, government, later, their, debts, and, payments, of, samurai, stipends, were, either, taxed, heavily, or, turned, into, bonds, which, resulted, in, a, large, loss, of, wealth, among, former, samurai, emperor, meiji, announced, in, his, 1868, charter, oath, that, knowledge, shall, be, sought, all, over, the, world, and, thereby, the, foundations, of, imperial, rule, shall, be, strengthened, under, the, leadership, of, mori, arinori, a, group, of, prominent, japanese, intellectuals, went, on, to, form, the, meiji, six, society, in, 1873, to, continue, to, promote, civilization, and, enlightenment, through, modern, ethics, and, ideas, however, during, the, restoration, political, power, simply, moved, from, the, tokugawa, shogunate, to, an, oligarchy, consisting, of, these, leaders, mostly, from, satsuma, province, kubo, toshimichi, and, saig, takamori, and, ch, sh, province, it, hirobumi, yamagata, aritomo, and, kido, takayoshi, this, reflected, their, belief, in, the, more, traditional, practice, of, imperial, rule, whereby, the, emperor, of, japan, serves, solely, as, the, spiritual, authority, of, the, nation, and, his, ministers, govern, the, nation, in, his, name, the, meiji, oligarchy, that, formed, the, government, under, the, rule, of, the, emperor, first, introduced, measures, to, consolidate, their, power, against, the, remnants, of, the, edo, period, government, the, shogunate, daimy, s, and, the, samurai, class, throughout, japan, at, the, time, the, samurai, numbered, 1, 9, million, for, comparison, this, was, more, than, 10, times, the, size, of, the, french, privileged, class, before, the, 1789, french, revolution, moreover, the, samurai, in, japan, were, not, merely, the, lords, but, also, their, higher, retainers, people, who, actually, worked, with, each, samurai, being, paid, fixed, stipends, their, upkeep, presented, a, tremendous, financial, burden, which, may, have, prompted, the, oligarchs, to, action, whatever, their, true, intentions, the, oligarchs, embarked, on, another, slow, and, deliberate, process, to, abolish, the, samurai, class, first, in, 1873, it, was, announced, that, the, samurai, stipends, were, to, be, taxed, on, a, rolling, basis, later, in, 1874, the, samurai, were, given, the, option, to, convert, their, stipends, into, government, bonds, finally, in, 1876, this, commutation, was, made, compulsory, to, reform, the, military, the, government, instituted, nationwide, conscription, in, 1873, mandating, that, every, male, would, serve, for, four, years, in, the, armed, forces, upon, turning, 21, years, old, followed, by, three, more, years, in, the, reserves, one, of, the, primary, differences, between, the, samurai, and, peasant, classes, was, the, right, to, bear, arms, this, ancient, privilege, was, suddenly, extended, to, every, male, in, the, nation, furthermore, samurai, were, no, longer, allowed, to, walk, about, town, bearing, a, sword, or, weapon, to, show, their, status, this, led, to, a, series, of, riots, from, disgruntled, samurai, one, of, the, major, riots, was, the, one, led, by, saig, takamori, the, satsuma, rebellion, which, eventually, turned, into, a, civil, war, this, rebellion, was, however, put, down, swiftly, by, the, newly, formed, imperial, japanese, army, trained, in, western, tactics, and, weapons, even, though, the, core, of, the, new, army, was, the, tokyo, police, force, which, was, largely, composed, of, former, samurai, this, sent, a, strong, message, to, the, dissenting, samurai, that, their, time, was, indeed, over, there, were, fewer, subsequent, samurai, uprisings, and, the, distinction, became, all, but, a, name, as, the, samurai, joined, the, new, society, the, ideal, of, samurai, military, spirit, lived, on, in, romanticized, form, and, was, often, used, as, propaganda, during, the, early, 20th, century, wars, of, the, empire, of, japan, however, it, is, equally, true, that, the, majority, of, samurai, were, content, despite, having, their, status, abolished, many, found, employment, in, the, government, bureaucracy, which, resembled, an, elite, class, in, its, own, right, the, samurai, being, better, educated, than, most, of, the, population, became, teachers, gun, makers, government, officials, and, or, military, officers, while, the, formal, title, of, samurai, was, abolished, the, elitist, spirit, that, characterized, the, samurai, class, lived, on, the, oligarchs, also, embarked, on, a, series, of, land, reforms, in, particular, they, legitimized, the, tenancy, system, which, had, been, going, on, during, the, tokugawa, period, despite, the, bakufu, s, best, efforts, to, freeze, the, four, classes, of, society, in, place, during, their, rule, villagers, had, begun, to, lease, land, out, to, other, farmers, becoming, rich, in, the, process, this, greatly, disrupted, the, clearly, defined, class, system, which, the, bakufu, had, envisaged, partly, leading, to, their, eventual, downfall, the, military, of, japan, strengthened, by, nationwide, conscription, and, emboldened, by, military, success, in, both, the, sino, japanese, war, and, the, russo, japanese, war, began, to, view, themselves, as, a, growing, world, power, besides, drastic, changes, to, the, social, structure, of, japan, in, an, attempt, to, create, a, strong, centralized, state, defining, its, national, identity, the, government, established, a, dominant, national, dialect, called, standard, language, hy, jungo, that, replaced, local, and, regional, dialects, and, was, based, on, the, patterns, of, tokyo, s, samurai, classes, this, dialect, eventually, became, the, norm, in, the, realms, of, education, media, government, and, business, the, meiji, restoration, and, the, resultant, modernization, of, japan, also, influenced, japanese, self, identity, with, respect, to, its, asian, neighbours, as, japan, became, the, first, asian, state, to, modernize, based, on, the, western, model, replacing, the, traditional, confucian, hierarchical, order, that, had, persisted, previously, under, a, dominant, china, with, one, based, on, modernity, adopting, enlightenment, ideals, of, popular, education, the, japanese, government, established, a, national, system, of, public, schools, these, free, schools, taught, students, reading, writing, and, mathematics, students, also, attended, courses, in, moral, training, which, reinforced, their, duty, to, the, emperor, and, to, the, japanese, state, by, the, end, of, the, meiji, period, attendance, in, public, schools, was, widespread, increasing, the, availability, of, skilled, workers, and, contributing, to, the, industrial, growth, of, japan, the, opening, up, of, japan, not, only, consisted, of, the, ports, being, opened, for, trade, but, also, began, the, process, of, merging, members, of, the, different, societies, together, examples, of, this, include, western, teachers, and, advisors, immigrating, to, japan, and, also, japanese, nationals, moving, to, western, countries, for, education, purposes, all, these, things, in, turn, played, a, part, in, expanding, the, people, of, japan, s, knowledge, on, western, customs, technology, and, institutions, many, people, believed, it, was, essential, for, japan, to, acquire, western, spirit, in, order, to, become, a, great, nation, with, strong, trade, routes, and, military, strength, the, meiji, restoration, accelerated, the, industrialization, process, in, japan, which, led, to, its, rise, as, a, military, power, by, the, year, 1895, under, the, slogan, of, enrich, the, country, strengthen, the, military, fukoku, ky, hei, there, were, a, few, factories, set, up, using, imported, technologies, in, the, 1860s, principally, by, westerners, in, the, international, settlements, of, yokohama, and, kobe, and, some, local, lords, but, these, had, relatively, small, impacts, it, was, only, in, the, 1870s, that, imported, technologies, began, to, play, a, significant, role, and, only, in, the, 1880s, did, they, produce, more, than, a, small, output, volume, during, the, meiji, period, powers, such, as, europe, and, the, united, states, helped, transform, japan, and, made, them, realize, a, change, needed, to, take, place, some, leaders, went, out, to, foreign, lands, and, used, the, knowledge, and, government, writings, to, help, shape, and, form, a, more, influential, government, within, their, walls, that, allowed, for, things, such, as, production, despite, the, help, japan, received, from, other, powers, one, of, the, key, factors, in, japan, s, industrializing, success, was, its, relative, lack, of, resources, which, made, it, unattractive, to, western, imperialism, the, farmer, and, the, samurai, classification, were, the, base, and, soon, the, problem, of, why, there, was, a, limit, of, growth, within, the, nation, s, industrial, work, the, government, sent, officials, such, as, the, samurai, to, monitor, the, work, that, was, being, done, because, of, japan, s, leaders, taking, control, and, adapting, western, techniques, it, has, remained, one, of, the, world, s, largest, industrial, nations, the, rapid, industrialization, and, modernization, of, japan, both, allowed, and, required, a, massive, increase, in, production, and, infrastructure, japan, built, industries, such, as, shipyards, iron, smelters, and, spinning, mills, which, were, then, sold, to, well, connected, entrepreneurs, consequently, domestic, companies, became, consumers, of, western, technology, and, applied, it, to, produce, items, that, would, be, sold, cheaply, in, the, international, market, with, this, industrial, zones, grew, enormously, and, there, was, a, massive, migration, to, industrializing, centers, from, the, countryside, industrialization, additionally, went, hand, in, hand, with, the, development, of, a, national, railway, system, and, modern, communications, with, industrialization, came, the, demand, for, coal, there, was, dramatic, rise, in, production, as, shown, in, the, table, below, coal, was, needed, for, steamships, and, railroads, the, growth, of, these, sectors, is, shown, below, the, majority, of, japanese, castles, were, partially, or, completely, dismantled, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, the, meiji, restoration, by, the, national, government, since, the, feudal, system, was, abolished, and, the, fiefs, han, theoretically, reverting, to, the, emperor, the, national, government, saw, no, further, use, for, the, upkeep, of, these, now, obsolete, castles, the, military, was, modernized, and, some, parts, of, the, castles, were, converted, into, modern, military, facilities, with, barracks, and, parade, grounds, such, as, hiroshima, castle, others, were, handed, over, to, the, civilian, authorities, to, build, their, new, administrative, structures, some, however, were, explicitly, saved, from, destruction, by, interventions, from, various, persons, and, parties, such, as, politicians, government, and, military, officials, experts, historians, and, locals, who, feared, a, loss, of, their, cultural, heritage, in, the, case, of, hikone, castle, even, though, the, government, ordered, its, dismantling, it, was, saved, by, orders, from, the, emperor, himself, nagoya, castle, and, nijo, castle, due, to, their, historical, and, cultural, importance, and, sheer, size, and, strategic, locations, both, became, official, imperial, detached, palaces, before, they, were, turned, over, to, the, local, authorities, in, the, 1930s, others, such, as, himeji, castle, survived, by, luck, during, the, meiji, restoration, s, shinbutsu, bunri, tens, of, thousands, of, japanese, buddhist, religious, idols, and, temples, were, smashed, and, destroyed, japan, then, closed, and, shut, down, tens, of, thousands, of, traditional, old, shinto, shrines, in, the, shrine, consolidation, policy, and, the, meiji, government, built, the, new, modern, 15, shrines, of, the, kenmu, restoration, as, a, political, move, to, link, the, meiji, restoration, to, the, kenmu, restoration, for, their, new, state, shinto, cult, in, the, blood, tax, riots, the, meiji, government, put, down, revolts, by, japanese, samurai, angry, that, the, traditional, untouchable, status, of, burakumin, was, legally, revoked, under, the, meiji, restoration, the, practices, of, the, samurai, classes, deemed, feudal, and, unsuitable, for, modern, times, following, the, end, of, sakoku, in, 1853, resulted, in, a, number, of, edicts, intended, to, modernise, the, appearance, of, upper, class, japanese, men, with, the, dampatsurei, edict, of, 1871, issued, by, emperor, meiji, during, the, early, meiji, era, men, of, the, samurai, classes, were, forced, to, cut, their, hair, short, effectively, abandoning, the, chonmage, chonmage, hairstyle, 149, during, the, meiji, restoration, the, practice, of, cremation, and, buddhism, were, condemned, and, the, japanese, government, tried, to, ban, cremation, but, were, unsuccessful, then, tried, to, limit, it, in, urban, areas, the, japanese, government, reversed, its, ban, on, cremation, and, pro, cremation, japanese, adopted, western, european, arguments, on, how, cremation, was, good, for, limiting, disease, spread, so, the, japanese, government, lifted, their, attempted, ban, in, may, 1875, and, promoted, cremation, for, diseased, people, in, 1897, even, before, the, meiji, restoration, the, tokugawa, shogunate, government, hired, german, diplomat, philipp, franz, von, siebold, as, diplomatic, advisor, dutch, naval, engineer, hendrik, hardes, for, nagasaki, arsenal, and, willem, johan, cornelis, ridder, huijssen, van, kattendijke, for, nagasaki, naval, training, center, french, naval, engineer, fran, ois, l, once, verny, for, yokosuka, naval, arsenal, and, british, civil, engineer, richard, henry, brunton, most, of, them, were, appointed, through, government, approval, with, two, or, three, years, contract, and, took, their, responsibility, properly, in, japan, except, some, cases, then, many, other, foreign, specialists, were, hired, despite, the, value, they, provided, in, the, modernization, of, japan, the, japanese, government, did, not, consider, it, prudent, for, them, to, settle, in, japan, permanently, after, their, contracts, ended, most, of, them, returned, to, their, country, except, some, like, josiah, conder, and, w, k, burton
