the, etruscan, civilization, t, r, s, k, n, ih, trus, k, n, was, an, ancient, civilization, created, by, the, etruscans, a, people, who, inhabited, etruria, in, ancient, italy, with, a, common, language, and, culture, who, formed, a, federation, of, city, states, after, conquering, adjacent, lands, its, territory, covered, at, its, greatest, extent, roughly, what, is, now, tuscany, western, umbria, and, northern, lazio, as, well, as, what, are, now, the, po, valley, emilia, romagna, south, eastern, lombardy, southern, veneto, and, western, campania, on, the, origins, of, the, etruscans, a, large, body, of, literature, has, flourished, however, the, consensus, among, modern, scholars, is, that, the, etruscans, were, an, indigenous, population, the, earliest, evidence, of, a, culture, that, is, identifiably, etruscan, dates, from, about, 900, bc, this, is, the, period, of, the, iron, age, villanovan, culture, considered, to, be, the, earliest, phase, of, etruscan, civilization, which, itself, developed, from, the, previous, late, bronze, age, proto, villanovan, culture, in, the, same, region, part, of, the, central, european, urnfield, culture, system, etruscan, civilization, dominated, italy, until, it, fell, to, the, expanding, rome, beginning, in, the, late, 4th, century, bc, as, a, result, of, the, roman, etruscan, wars, etruscans, were, granted, roman, citizenship, in, 90, bc, and, only, in, 27, bc, the, whole, etruscan, territory, was, incorporated, into, the, newly, established, roman, empire, the, territorial, extent, of, etruscan, civilization, reached, its, maximum, around, 750, bc, during, the, foundational, period, of, the, roman, kingdom, its, culture, flourished, in, three, confederacies, of, cities, that, of, etruria, tuscany, latium, and, umbria, that, of, the, po, valley, with, the, eastern, alps, and, that, of, campania, the, league, in, northern, italy, is, mentioned, in, livy, the, reduction, in, etruscan, territory, was, gradual, but, after, 500, bc, the, political, balance, of, power, on, the, italian, peninsula, shifted, away, from, the, etruscans, in, favor, of, the, rising, roman, republic, the, earliest, known, examples, of, etruscan, writing, are, inscriptions, found, in, southern, etruria, that, date, to, around, 700, bc, the, etruscans, developed, a, system, of, writing, derived, from, the, euboean, alphabet, which, was, used, in, the, magna, graecia, coastal, areas, located, in, southern, italy, the, etruscan, language, remains, only, partly, understood, making, modern, understanding, of, their, society, and, culture, heavily, dependent, on, much, later, and, generally, disapproving, roman, and, greek, sources, in, the, etruscan, political, system, authority, resided, in, its, individual, small, cities, and, probably, in, its, prominent, individual, families, at, the, height, of, etruscan, power, elite, etruscan, families, grew, very, rich, through, trade, with, the, celts, to, the, north, and, the, greeks, to, the, south, and, they, filled, their, large, family, tombs, with, imported, luxuries, according, to, dionysius, the, etruscans, called, themselves, rasenna, greek, a, stem, from, the, etruscan, rasna, the, people, evidence, of, inscriptions, as, tular, rasnal, boundary, of, the, people, or, mechlum, rasnal, community, of, the, people, attest, to, its, autonym, usage, the, tyrsenian, etymology, however, remains, unknown, in, attic, greek, the, etruscans, were, known, as, tyrrhenians, tyrrh, noi, earlier, tyrs, noi, from, which, the, romans, derived, the, names, tyrrh, n, tyrrh, nia, etruria, and, mare, tyrrh, num, tyrrhenian, sea, the, ancient, romans, referred, to, the, etruscans, as, the, tusc, or, etrusc, singular, tuscus, their, roman, name, is, the, origin, of, the, terms, toscana, which, refers, to, their, heartland, and, etruria, which, can, refer, to, their, wider, region, the, term, tusci, is, thought, by, linguists, to, have, been, the, umbrian, word, for, etruscan, based, on, an, inscription, on, an, ancient, bronze, tablet, from, a, nearby, region, the, inscription, contains, the, phrase, turskum, nomen, literally, the, tuscan, name, based, on, a, knowledge, of, umbrian, grammar, linguists, can, infer, that, the, base, form, of, the, word, turskum, is, tursci, which, would, through, metathesis, and, a, word, initial, epenthesis, be, likely, to, lead, to, the, form, e, trus, ci, as, for, the, original, meaning, of, the, root, turs, a, widely, cited, hypothesis, is, that, it, like, the, word, latin, turris, means, tower, and, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, word, for, tower, likely, a, loan, into, greek, on, this, hypothesis, the, tusci, were, called, the, people, who, build, towers, or, the, tower, builders, this, proposed, etymology, is, made, the, more, plausible, because, the, etruscans, preferred, to, build, their, towns, on, high, precipices, reinforced, by, walls, alternatively, giuliano, and, larissa, bonfante, have, speculated, that, etruscan, houses, may, have, seemed, like, towers, to, the, simple, latins, the, proposed, etymology, has, a, long, history, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, having, observed, in, the, first, century, b, c, here, is, no, reason, that, the, greeks, should, not, have, called, by, this, name, both, from, their, living, in, towers, and, from, the, name, of, one, of, their, rulers, in, his, recent, etymological, dictionary, of, greek, robert, beekes, claims, the, greek, word, is, a, loanword, from, a, mediterranean, language, a, hypothesis, that, goes, back, to, an, article, by, paul, kretschmer, in, glotta, from, 1934, literary, and, historical, texts, in, the, etruscan, language, have, not, survived, and, the, language, itself, is, only, partially, understood, by, modern, scholars, this, makes, modern, understanding, of, their, society, and, culture, heavily, dependent, on, much, later, and, generally, disapproving, roman, and, greek, sources, these, ancient, writers, differed, in, their, theories, about, the, origin, of, the, etruscan, people, some, suggested, they, were, pelasgians, who, had, migrated, there, from, greece, others, maintained, that, they, were, indigenous, to, central, italy, and, were, not, from, greece, the, first, greek, author, to, mention, the, etruscans, whom, the, ancient, greeks, called, tyrrhenians, was, the, 8th, century, bc, poet, hesiod, in, his, work, the, theogony, he, mentioned, them, as, residing, in, central, italy, alongside, the, latins, the, 7th, century, bc, homeric, hymn, to, dionysus, referred, to, them, as, pirates, unlike, later, greek, authors, these, authors, did, not, suggest, that, etruscans, had, migrated, to, italy, from, the, east, and, did, not, associate, them, with, the, pelasgians, it, was, only, in, the, 5th, century, bc, when, the, etruscan, civilization, had, been, established, for, several, centuries, that, greek, writers, started, associating, the, name, tyrrhenians, with, the, pelasgians, and, even, then, some, did, so, in, a, way, that, suggests, they, were, meant, only, as, generic, descriptive, labels, for, non, greek, and, indigenous, ancestors, of, greeks, respectively, the, 5th, century, bc, historians, herodotus, and, thucydides, and, the, 1st, century, bc, historian, strabo, did, seem, to, suggest, that, the, tyrrhenians, were, originally, pelasgians, who, migrated, to, italy, from, lydia, by, way, of, the, greek, island, of, lemnos, they, all, described, lemnos, as, having, been, settled, by, pelasgians, whom, thucydides, identified, as, belonging, to, the, tyrrhenians, as, strabo, and, herodotus, told, it, the, migration, to, lemnos, was, led, by, tyrrhenus, tyrsenos, the, son, of, atys, who, was, king, of, lydia, strabo, added, that, the, pelasgians, of, lemnos, and, imbros, then, followed, tyrrhenus, to, the, italian, peninsula, according, to, the, logographer, hellanicus, of, lesbos, there, was, a, pelasgian, migration, from, thessaly, in, greece, to, the, italian, peninsula, as, part, of, which, the, pelasgians, colonized, the, area, he, called, tyrrhenia, and, they, then, came, to, be, called, tyrrhenians, there, is, some, evidence, suggesting, a, link, between, the, island, of, lemnos, and, the, tyrrhenians, the, lemnos, stele, bears, inscriptions, in, a, language, with, strong, structural, resemblances, to, the, language, of, the, etruscans, the, discovery, of, these, inscriptions, in, modern, times, has, led, to, the, suggestion, of, a, tyrrhenian, language, group, comprising, etruscan, lemnian, and, the, raetic, spoken, in, the, alps, however, the, 1st, century, bc, historian, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, a, greek, living, in, rome, dismissed, many, of, the, ancient, theories, of, other, greek, historians, and, postulated, that, the, etruscans, were, indigenous, people, who, had, always, lived, in, etruria, and, were, different, from, both, the, pelasgians, and, the, lydians, dionysius, noted, that, the, 5th, century, historian, xanthus, of, lydia, who, was, originally, from, sardis, and, was, regarded, as, an, important, source, and, authority, for, the, history, of, lydia, never, suggested, a, lydian, origin, of, the, etruscans, and, never, named, tyrrhenus, as, a, ruler, of, the, lydians, for, this, reason, therefore, i, am, persuaded, that, the, pelasgians, are, a, different, people, from, the, tyrrhenians, and, i, do, not, believe, either, that, the, tyrrhenians, were, a, colony, of, the, lydians, for, they, do, not, use, the, same, language, as, the, latter, nor, can, it, be, alleged, that, though, they, no, longer, speak, a, similar, tongue, they, still, retain, some, other, indications, of, their, mother, country, for, they, neither, worship, the, same, gods, as, the, lydians, nor, make, use, of, similar, laws, or, institutions, but, in, these, very, respects, they, differ, more, from, the, lydians, than, from, the, pelasgians, indeed, those, probably, come, nearest, to, the, truth, who, declare, that, the, nation, migrated, from, nowhere, else, but, was, native, to, the, country, since, it, is, found, to, be, a, very, ancient, nation, and, to, agree, with, no, other, either, in, its, language, or, in, its, manner, of, living, the, credibility, of, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, is, arguably, bolstered, by, the, fact, that, he, was, the, first, ancient, writer, to, report, the, endonym, of, the, etruscans, rasenna, the, romans, however, give, them, other, names, from, the, country, they, once, inhabited, named, etruria, they, call, them, etruscans, and, from, their, knowledge, of, the, ceremonies, relating, to, divine, worship, in, which, they, excel, others, they, now, call, them, rather, inaccurately, tusci, but, formerly, with, the, same, accuracy, as, the, greeks, they, called, them, thyrsco, their, own, name, for, themselves, however, is, the, same, as, that, of, one, of, their, leaders, rasenna, similarly, the, 1st, century, bc, historian, livy, in, his, ab, urbe, condita, libri, said, that, the, rhaetians, were, etruscans, who, had, been, driven, into, the, mountains, by, the, invading, gauls, and, he, asserted, that, the, inhabitants, of, raetia, were, of, etruscan, origin, the, alpine, tribes, have, also, no, doubt, the, same, origin, of, the, etruscans, especially, the, raetians, who, have, been, rendered, so, savage, by, the, very, nature, of, the, country, as, to, retain, nothing, of, their, ancient, character, save, the, sound, of, their, speech, and, even, that, is, corrupted, the, first, century, historian, pliny, the, elder, also, put, the, etruscans, in, the, context, of, the, rhaetian, people, to, the, north, and, wrote, in, his, natural, history, ad, 79, adjoining, these, the, alpine, noricans, are, the, raeti, and, vindelici, all, are, divided, into, a, number, of, states, the, raeti, are, believed, to, be, people, of, tuscan, race, driven, out, by, the, gauls, their, leader, was, named, raetus, the, question, of, the, origins, of, the, etruscans, has, long, been, a, subject, of, interest, and, debate, among, historians, in, modern, times, all, the, evidence, gathered, so, far, by, prehistoric, and, protohistoric, archaeologists, anthropologists, and, etruscologists, points, to, an, autochthonous, origin, of, the, etruscans, there, is, no, archaeological, or, linguistic, evidence, of, a, migration, of, the, lydians, or, pelasgians, into, etruria, modern, etruscologists, and, archeologists, such, as, massimo, pallottino, 1947, have, shown, that, early, historians, assumptions, and, assertions, on, the, subject, were, groundless, in, 2000, the, etruscologist, dominique, briquel, explained, in, detail, why, he, believes, that, ancient, greek, historians, accounts, on, etruscan, origins, should, not, even, count, as, historical, documents, he, argues, that, the, ancient, story, of, the, etruscans, lydian, origins, was, a, deliberate, politically, motivated, fabrication, and, that, ancient, greeks, inferred, a, connection, between, the, tyrrhenians, and, the, pelasgians, solely, on, the, basis, of, certain, greek, and, local, traditions, and, on, the, mere, fact, that, there, had, been, trade, between, the, etruscans, and, greeks, he, noted, that, even, if, these, stories, include, historical, facts, suggesting, contact, such, contact, is, more, plausibly, traceable, to, cultural, exchange, than, to, migration, several, archaeologists, specializing, in, prehistory, and, protohistory, who, have, analyzed, bronze, age, and, iron, age, remains, that, were, excavated, in, the, territory, of, historical, etruria, have, pointed, out, that, no, evidence, has, been, found, related, either, to, material, culture, or, to, social, practices, that, can, support, a, migration, theory, the, most, marked, and, radical, change, that, has, been, archaeologically, attested, in, the, area, is, the, adoption, starting, in, about, the, 12th, century, bc, of, the, funeral, rite, of, incineration, in, terracotta, urns, which, is, a, continental, european, practice, derived, from, the, urnfield, culture, there, is, nothing, about, it, that, suggests, an, ethnic, contribution, from, asia, minor, or, the, near, east, a, 2012, survey, of, the, previous, 30, years, archaeological, findings, based, on, excavations, of, the, major, etruscan, cities, showed, a, continuity, of, culture, from, the, last, phase, of, the, bronze, age, 13th, 11th, century, bc, to, the, iron, age, 10th, 9th, century, bc, this, is, evidence, that, the, etruscan, civilization, which, emerged, around, 900, bc, was, built, by, people, whose, ancestors, had, inhabited, that, region, for, at, least, the, previous, 200, years, based, on, this, cultural, continuity, there, is, now, a, consensus, among, archeologists, that, proto, etruscan, culture, developed, during, the, last, phase, of, the, bronze, age, from, the, indigenous, proto, villanovan, culture, and, that, the, subsequent, iron, age, villanovan, culture, is, most, accurately, described, as, an, early, phase, of, the, etruscan, civilization, it, is, possible, that, there, were, contacts, between, northern, central, italy, and, the, mycenaean, world, at, the, end, of, the, bronze, age, however, contacts, between, the, inhabitants, of, etruria, and, inhabitants, of, greece, aegean, sea, islands, asia, minor, and, the, near, east, are, attested, only, centuries, later, when, etruscan, civilization, was, already, flourishing, and, etruscan, ethnogenesis, was, well, established, the, first, of, these, attested, contacts, relate, to, the, greek, colonies, in, southern, italy, and, phoenician, punic, colonies, in, sardinia, and, the, consequent, orientalizing, period, one, of, the, most, common, mistakes, for, a, long, time, even, among, some, scholars, of, the, past, has, been, to, associate, the, later, orientalizing, period, of, etruscan, civilization, with, the, question, of, its, origins, orientalization, was, an, artistic, and, cultural, phenomenon, that, spread, among, the, greeks, themselves, and, throughout, much, of, the, central, and, western, mediterranean, not, only, in, etruria, orientalizing, period, in, the, etruscans, was, due, as, has, been, amply, demonstrated, by, archeologists, to, contacts, with, the, greeks, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, not, to, mass, migrations, the, facial, features, the, profile, almond, shaped, eyes, large, nose, in, the, frescoes, and, sculptures, and, the, depiction, of, reddish, brown, men, and, light, skinned, women, influenced, by, archaic, greek, art, followed, the, artistic, traditions, from, the, eastern, mediterranean, that, had, spread, even, among, the, greeks, themselves, and, to, a, lesser, extent, also, to, other, several, civilizations, in, the, central, and, western, mediterranean, up, to, the, iberian, peninsula, actually, many, of, the, tombs, of, the, late, orientalizing, and, archaic, periods, such, as, the, tomb, of, the, augurs, the, tomb, of, the, triclinium, or, the, tomb, of, the, leopards, as, well, as, other, tombs, from, the, archaic, period, in, the, monterozzi, necropolis, in, tarquinia, were, painted, by, greek, painters, or, in, any, case, foreigner, artists, these, images, have, therefore, a, very, limited, value, for, a, realistic, representation, of, the, etruscan, population, it, was, only, from, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, that, evidence, of, physiognomic, portraits, began, to, be, found, in, etruscan, art, and, etruscan, portraiture, became, more, realistic, there, have, been, numerous, biological, studies, on, the, etruscan, origins, the, oldest, of, which, dates, back, to, the, 1950s, when, research, was, still, based, on, blood, tests, of, modern, samples, and, dna, analysis, including, the, analysis, of, ancient, samples, was, not, yet, possible, it, is, only, in, very, recent, years, with, the, development, of, archaeogenetics, that, comprehensive, studies, containing, the, whole, genome, sequencing, of, etruscan, samples, have, been, published, including, autosomal, dna, and, y, dna, autosomal, dna, being, the, most, valuable, to, understand, what, really, happened, in, an, individual, s, history, as, stated, by, geneticist, david, reich, whereas, previously, studies, were, based, only, on, mitochondrial, dna, analysis, which, contains, less, and, limited, information, an, archeogenetic, study, focusing, on, the, question, of, etruscan, origins, was, published, in, september, 2021, in, the, journal, science, advances, and, analyzed, the, autosomal, dna, and, the, uniparental, markers, y, dna, and, mtdna, of, 48, iron, age, individuals, from, tuscany, and, lazio, spanning, from, 800, to, 1, bc, and, concluding, that, the, etruscans, were, autochthonous, locally, indigenous, and, they, had, a, genetic, profile, similar, to, their, latin, neighbors, in, the, etruscan, individuals, the, ancestral, component, steppe, was, present, in, the, same, percentages, found, in, the, previously, analyzed, iron, age, latins, and, in, the, etruscan, dna, was, completely, absent, a, signal, of, recent, admixture, with, anatolia, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, both, etruscans, and, latins, joined, firmly, the, european, cluster, west, of, modern, italians, the, etruscans, were, a, mixture, of, whg, eef, and, steppe, ancestry, 75, of, the, etruscan, male, individuals, were, found, to, belong, to, haplogroup, r1b, r1b, m269, especially, its, clade, r1b, p312, and, its, derivative, r1b, l2, whose, direct, ancestor, is, r1b, u152, while, the, most, common, mitochondrial, dna, haplogroup, among, the, etruscans, was, h, the, conclusions, of, the, 2021, study, are, in, line, with, a, 2019, study, previously, published, in, the, journal, science, that, analyzed, the, remains, of, eleven, iron, age, individuals, from, the, areas, around, rome, of, which, four, were, etruscan, individuals, one, buried, in, veio, grotta, gramiccia, from, the, villanovan, era, 900, 800, bc, and, three, buried, in, la, mattonara, necropolis, near, civitavecchia, from, the, orientalizing, period, 700, 600, bc, the, study, concluded, that, etruscans, 900, 600, bc, and, the, latins, 900, 500, bc, from, latium, vetus, were, genetically, similar, with, genetic, differences, between, the, examined, etruscans, and, latins, found, to, be, insignificant, the, etruscan, individuals, and, contemporary, latins, were, distinguished, from, preceding, populations, of, italy, by, the, presence, of, c, 30, steppe, ancestry, their, dna, was, a, mixture, of, two, thirds, copper, age, ancestry, eef, whg, etruscans, 66, 72, latins, 62, 75, and, one, third, steppe, related, ancestry, etruscans, 27, 33, latins, 24, 37, the, only, sample, of, y, dna, extracted, belonged, to, haplogroup, j, m12, j2b, l283, found, in, an, individual, dated, 700, 600, bc, and, carried, exactly, the, m314, derived, allele, also, found, in, a, middle, bronze, age, individual, from, croatia, 1631, 1531, bc, while, the, four, samples, of, mtdna, extracted, belonged, to, haplogroups, u5a1, h, t2b32, k1a4, among, the, older, studies, only, based, on, mitochondrial, dna, a, mtdna, study, published, in, 2018, in, the, journal, american, journal, of, physical, anthropology, compared, both, ancient, and, modern, samples, from, tuscany, from, the, prehistory, etruscan, age, roman, age, renaissance, and, present, day, and, concluded, that, the, etruscans, appear, as, a, local, population, intermediate, between, the, prehistoric, and, the, other, samples, placing, in, the, temporal, network, between, the, eneolithic, age, and, the, roman, age, a, couple, of, mitochondrial, dna, studies, published, in, 2013, in, the, journals, plos, one, and, american, journal, of, physical, anthropology, based, on, etruscan, samples, from, tuscany, and, latium, concluded, that, the, etruscans, were, an, indigenous, population, showing, that, etruscan, mtdna, appears, to, fall, very, close, to, a, neolithic, population, from, central, europe, germany, austria, hungary, and, to, other, tuscan, populations, strongly, suggesting, that, the, etruscan, civilization, developed, locally, from, the, villanovan, culture, as, already, supported, by, archaeological, evidence, and, anthropological, research, and, that, genetic, links, between, tuscany, and, western, anatolia, date, back, to, at, least, 5, 000, years, ago, during, the, neolithic, and, the, most, likely, separation, time, between, tuscany, and, western, anatolia, falls, around, 7, 600, years, ago, at, the, time, of, the, migrations, of, early, european, farmers, eef, from, anatolia, to, europe, in, the, early, neolithic, the, ancient, etruscan, samples, had, mitochondrial, dna, haplogroups, mtdna, jt, subclades, of, j, and, t, and, u5, with, a, minority, of, mtdna, h1b, an, earlier, mtdna, study, published, in, 2004, based, on, about, 28, samples, of, individuals, who, lived, from, 600, to, 100, bc, in, veneto, etruria, and, campania, stated, that, the, etruscans, had, no, significant, heterogeneity, and, that, all, mitochondrial, lineages, observed, among, the, etruscan, samples, appear, typically, european, or, west, asian, but, only, a, few, haplotypes, were, shared, with, modern, populations, allele, sharing, between, the, etruscans, and, modern, populations, is, highest, among, germans, seven, haplotypes, in, common, the, cornish, from, the, south, west, of, britain, five, haplotypes, in, common, the, turks, four, haplotypes, in, common, and, the, tuscans, two, haplotypes, in, common, while, the, modern, populations, with, the, shortest, genetic, distance, from, the, ancient, etruscans, based, solely, on, mtdna, and, fst, were, tuscans, followed, by, the, turks, other, populations, from, the, mediterranean, and, the, cornish, after, this, study, was, much, criticized, by, other, geneticists, because, data, represent, severely, damaged, or, partly, contaminated, mtdna, sequences, and, any, comparison, with, modern, population, data, must, be, considered, quite, hazardous, and, archaeologists, who, argued, that, the, study, was, not, clear, cut, and, had, not, provided, evidence, that, the, etruscans, were, an, intrusive, population, to, the, european, context, in, the, collective, volume, etruscology, published, in, 2017, british, archeologist, phil, perkins, echoing, an, earlier, article, of, his, from, 2009, provides, an, analysis, of, the, state, of, dna, studies, and, writes, that, none, of, the, dna, studies, to, date, conclusively, prove, that, etruscans, were, an, intrusive, population, in, italy, that, originated, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, or, anatolia, and, there, are, indications, that, the, evidence, of, dna, can, support, the, theory, that, etruscan, people, are, autochthonous, in, central, italy, in, his, 2021, book, a, short, history, of, humanity, german, geneticist, johannes, krause, co, director, of, the, max, planck, institute, for, evolutionary, anthropology, in, jena, concludes, that, it, is, likely, that, the, etruscan, language, as, well, as, basque, paleo, sardinian, and, minoan, developed, on, the, continent, in, the, course, of, the, neolithic, revolution, the, etruscan, civilization, begins, with, the, early, iron, age, villanovan, culture, regarded, as, the, oldest, phase, that, occupied, a, large, area, of, northern, and, central, italy, during, the, iron, age, the, etruscans, themselves, dated, the, origin, of, the, etruscan, nation, to, a, date, corresponding, to, the, 11th, or, 10th, century, bc, the, villanovan, culture, emerges, with, the, phenomenon, of, regionalization, from, the, late, bronze, age, culture, called, proto, villanovan, part, of, the, central, european, urnfield, culture, system, in, the, last, villanovan, phase, called, the, recent, phase, about, 770, 730, bc, the, etruscans, established, relations, of, a, certain, consistency, with, the, first, greek, immigrants, in, southern, italy, in, pithecusa, and, then, in, cuma, so, much, so, as, to, initially, absorb, techniques, and, figurative, models, and, soon, more, properly, cultural, models, with, the, introduction, for, example, of, writing, of, a, new, way, of, banqueting, of, a, heroic, funerary, ideology, that, is, a, new, aristocratic, way, of, life, such, as, to, profoundly, change, the, physiognomy, of, etruscan, society, thus, thanks, to, the, growing, number, of, contacts, with, the, greeks, the, etruscans, entered, what, is, called, the, orientalizing, phase, in, this, phase, there, was, a, heavy, influence, in, greece, most, of, italy, and, some, areas, of, spain, from, the, most, advanced, areas, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, the, ancient, near, east, also, directly, phoenician, or, otherwise, near, eastern, craftsmen, merchants, and, artists, contributed, to, the, spread, in, southern, europe, of, near, eastern, cultural, and, artistic, motifs, the, last, three, phases, of, etruscan, civilization, are, called, respectively, archaic, classical, and, hellenistic, which, roughly, correspond, to, the, homonymous, phases, of, the, ancient, greek, civilization, etruscan, expansion, was, focused, both, to, the, north, beyond, the, apennine, mountains, and, into, campania, some, small, towns, in, the, sixth, century, bc, disappeared, during, this, time, ostensibly, subsumed, by, greater, more, powerful, neighbors, however, it, is, certain, that, the, political, structure, of, the, etruscan, culture, was, similar, to, albeit, more, aristocratic, than, magna, graecia, in, the, south, the, mining, and, commerce, of, metal, especially, copper, and, iron, led, to, an, enrichment, of, the, etruscans, and, to, the, expansion, of, their, influence, in, the, italian, peninsula, and, the, western, mediterranean, sea, here, their, interests, collided, with, those, of, the, greeks, especially, in, the, sixth, century, bc, when, phocaeans, of, italy, founded, colonies, along, the, coast, of, sardinia, spain, and, corsica, this, led, the, etruscans, to, ally, themselves, with, carthage, whose, interests, also, collided, with, the, greeks, around, 540, bc, the, battle, of, alalia, led, to, a, new, distribution, of, power, in, the, western, mediterranean, though, the, battle, had, no, clear, winner, carthage, managed, to, expand, its, sphere, of, influence, at, the, expense, of, the, greeks, and, etruria, saw, itself, relegated, to, the, northern, tyrrhenian, sea, with, full, ownership, of, corsica, from, the, first, half, of, the, 5th, century, bc, the, new, political, situation, meant, the, beginning, of, the, etruscan, decline, after, losing, their, southern, provinces, in, 480, bc, etruria, s, ally, carthage, was, defeated, by, a, coalition, of, magna, graecia, cities, led, by, syracuse, sicily, a, few, years, later, in, 474, bc, syracuse, s, tyrant, hiero, defeated, the, etruscans, at, the, battle, of, cumae, etruria, s, influence, over, the, cities, of, latium, and, campania, weakened, and, the, area, was, taken, over, by, romans, and, samnites, in, the, 4th, century, bc, etruria, saw, a, gallic, invasion, end, its, influence, over, the, po, valley, and, the, adriatic, coast, meanwhile, rome, had, started, annexing, etruscan, cities, this, led, to, the, loss, of, the, northern, etruscan, provinces, during, the, roman, etruscan, wars, etruria, was, conquered, by, rome, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, according, to, legend, there, was, a, period, between, 600, bc, and, 500, bc, in, which, an, alliance, was, formed, among, twelve, etruscan, settlements, known, today, as, the, etruscan, league, etruscan, federation, or, dodecapolis, greek, according, to, a, legend, the, etruscan, league, of, twelve, cities, was, founded, by, tarchon, and, his, brother, tyrrhenus, tarchon, lent, his, name, to, the, city, of, tarchna, or, tarquinnii, as, it, was, known, by, the, romans, tyrrhenus, gave, his, name, to, the, tyrrhenians, the, alternative, name, for, the, etruscans, although, there, is, no, consensus, on, which, cities, were, in, the, league, the, following, list, may, be, close, to, the, mark, arretium, caisra, clevsin, curtun, perusna, pupluna, veii, tarchna, vetluna, volterra, velzna, and, velch, some, modern, authors, include, rusellae, the, league, was, mostly, an, economic, and, religious, league, or, a, loose, confederation, similar, to, the, greek, states, during, the, later, imperial, times, when, etruria, was, just, one, of, many, regions, controlled, by, rome, the, number, of, cities, in, the, league, increased, by, three, this, is, noted, on, many, later, grave, stones, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, onwards, according, to, livy, the, twelve, city, states, met, once, a, year, at, the, fanum, voltumnae, at, volsinii, where, a, leader, was, chosen, to, represent, the, league, there, were, two, other, etruscan, leagues, lega, dei, popoli, that, of, campania, the, main, city, of, which, was, capua, and, the, po, valley, city, states, in, northern, italy, which, included, bologna, spina, and, adria, those, who, subscribe, to, a, latin, foundation, of, rome, followed, by, an, etruscan, invasion, typically, speak, of, an, etruscan, influence, on, roman, culture, that, is, cultural, objects, which, were, adopted, by, rome, from, neighboring, etruria, the, prevailing, view, is, that, rome, was, founded, by, latins, who, later, merged, with, etruscans, in, this, interpretation, etruscan, cultural, objects, are, considered, influences, rather, than, part, of, a, heritage, rome, was, probably, a, small, settlement, until, the, arrival, of, the, etruscans, who, constructed, the, first, elements, of, its, urban, infrastructure, such, as, the, drainage, system, the, main, criterion, for, deciding, whether, an, object, originated, at, rome, and, traveled, by, influence, to, the, etruscans, or, descended, to, the, romans, from, the, etruscans, is, date, many, if, not, most, of, the, etruscan, cities, were, older, than, rome, if, one, finds, that, a, given, feature, was, there, first, it, cannot, have, originated, at, rome, a, second, criterion, is, the, opinion, of, the, ancient, sources, these, would, indicate, that, certain, institutions, and, customs, came, directly, from, the, etruscans, rome, is, located, on, the, edge, of, what, was, etruscan, territory, when, etruscan, settlements, turned, up, south, of, the, border, it, was, presumed, that, the, etruscans, spread, there, after, the, foundation, of, rome, but, the, settlements, are, now, known, to, have, preceded, rome, etruscan, settlements, were, frequently, built, on, hills, the, steeper, the, better, and, surrounded, by, thick, walls, according, to, roman, mythology, when, romulus, and, remus, founded, rome, they, did, so, on, the, palatine, hill, according, to, etruscan, ritual, that, is, they, began, with, a, pomerium, or, sacred, ditch, then, they, proceeded, to, the, walls, romulus, was, required, to, kill, remus, when, the, latter, jumped, over, the, wall, breaking, its, magic, spell, see, also, under, pons, sublicius, the, name, of, rome, is, attested, in, etruscan, in, the, form, ruma, meaning, roman, a, form, that, mirrors, other, attested, ethnonyms, in, that, language, with, the, same, suffix, velzna, someone, from, volsinii, and, sveama, someone, from, sovana, this, in, itself, however, is, not, enough, to, prove, etruscan, origin, conclusively, if, tiberius, is, from, efarie, then, ruma, would, have, been, placed, on, the, thefar, tiber, river, a, heavily, discussed, topic, among, scholars, is, who, was, the, founding, population, of, rome, in, 390, bc, the, city, of, rome, was, attacked, by, the, gauls, and, as, a, result, may, have, lost, many, though, not, all, of, its, earlier, records, later, history, relates, that, some, etruscans, lived, in, the, vicus, tuscus, the, etruscan, quarter, and, that, there, was, an, etruscan, line, of, kings, albeit, ones, descended, from, a, greek, demaratus, of, corinth, that, succeeded, kings, of, latin, and, sabine, origin, etruscophile, historians, would, argue, that, this, together, with, evidence, for, institutions, religious, elements, and, other, cultural, elements, proves, that, rome, was, founded, by, etruscans, under, romulus, and, numa, pompilius, the, people, were, said, to, have, been, divided, into, thirty, curiae, and, three, tribes, few, etruscan, words, entered, latin, but, the, names, of, at, least, two, of, the, tribes, ramnes, and, luceres, seem, to, be, etruscan, the, last, kings, may, have, borne, the, etruscan, title, lucumo, while, the, regalia, were, traditionally, considered, of, etruscan, origin, the, golden, crown, the, sceptre, the, toga, palmata, a, special, robe, the, sella, curulis, curule, chair, and, above, all, the, primary, symbol, of, state, power, the, fasces, the, latter, was, a, bundle, of, whipping, rods, surrounding, a, double, bladed, axe, carried, by, the, king, s, lictors, an, example, of, the, fasces, are, the, remains, of, bronze, rods, and, the, axe, from, a, tomb, in, etruscan, vetulonia, this, allowed, archaeologists, to, identify, the, depiction, of, a, fasces, on, the, grave, stele, of, avele, feluske, who, is, shown, as, a, warrior, wielding, the, fasces, the, most, telling, etruscan, feature, is, the, word, populus, which, appears, as, an, etruscan, deity, fufluns, the, historical, etruscans, had, achieved, a, state, system, of, society, with, remnants, of, the, chiefdom, and, tribal, forms, rome, was, in, a, sense, the, first, italic, state, but, it, began, as, an, etruscan, one, it, is, believed, that, the, etruscan, government, style, changed, from, total, monarchy, to, oligarchic, republic, as, the, roman, republic, in, the, 6th, century, bc, the, government, was, viewed, as, being, a, central, authority, ruling, over, all, tribal, and, clan, organizations, it, retained, the, power, of, life, and, death, in, fact, the, gorgon, an, ancient, symbol, of, that, power, appears, as, a, motif, in, etruscan, decoration, the, adherents, to, this, state, power, were, united, by, a, common, religion, political, unity, in, etruscan, society, was, the, city, state, which, was, probably, the, referent, of, methlum, district, etruscan, texts, name, quite, a, number, of, magistrates, without, much, of, a, hint, as, to, their, function, the, camthi, the, parnich, the, purth, the, tamera, the, macstrev, and, so, on, the, people, were, the, mech, the, princely, tombs, were, not, of, individuals, the, inscription, evidence, shows, that, families, were, interred, there, over, long, periods, marking, the, growth, of, the, aristocratic, family, as, a, fixed, institution, parallel, to, the, gens, at, rome, and, perhaps, even, its, model, the, etruscans, could, have, used, any, model, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, that, the, growth, of, this, class, is, related, to, the, new, acquisition, of, wealth, through, trade, is, unquestioned, the, wealthiest, cities, were, located, near, the, coast, at, the, center, of, the, society, was, the, married, couple, tusurthir, the, etruscans, were, a, monogamous, society, that, emphasized, pairing, similarly, the, behavior, of, some, wealthy, women, is, not, uniquely, etruscan, the, apparent, promiscuous, revelry, has, a, spiritual, explanation, swaddling, and, bonfante, among, others, explain, that, depictions, of, the, nude, embrace, or, symplegma, had, the, power, to, ward, off, evil, as, did, baring, the, breast, which, was, adopted, by, western, culture, as, an, apotropaic, device, appearing, finally, on, the, figureheads, of, sailing, ships, as, a, nude, female, upper, torso, it, is, also, possible, that, greek, and, roman, attitudes, to, the, etruscans, were, based, on, a, misunderstanding, of, the, place, of, women, within, their, society, in, both, greece, and, the, earliest, republican, rome, respectable, women, were, confined, to, the, house, and, mixed, sex, socialising, did, not, occur, thus, the, freedom, of, women, within, etruscan, society, could, have, been, misunderstood, as, implying, their, sexual, availability, it, is, worth, noting, that, a, number, of, etruscan, tombs, carry, funerary, inscriptions, in, the, form, x, son, of, father, and, mother, indicating, the, importance, of, the, mother, s, side, of, the, family, the, etruscans, like, the, contemporary, cultures, of, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, had, a, significant, military, tradition, in, addition, to, marking, the, rank, and, power, of, certain, individuals, warfare, was, a, considerable, economic, advantage, to, etruscan, civilization, like, many, ancient, societies, the, etruscans, conducted, campaigns, during, summer, months, raiding, neighboring, areas, attempting, to, gain, territory, and, combating, piracy, as, a, means, of, acquiring, valuable, resources, such, as, land, prestige, goods, and, slaves, it, is, likely, that, individuals, taken, in, battle, would, be, ransomed, back, to, their, families, and, clans, at, high, cost, prisoners, could, also, potentially, be, sacrificed, on, tombs, to, honor, fallen, leaders, of, etruscan, society, not, unlike, the, sacrifices, made, by, achilles, for, patrocles, the, range, of, etruscan, civilization, is, marked, by, its, cities, they, were, entirely, assimilated, by, italic, celtic, or, roman, ethnic, groups, but, the, names, survive, from, inscriptions, and, their, ruins, are, of, aesthetic, and, historic, interest, in, most, of, the, cities, of, central, italy, etruscan, cities, flourished, over, most, of, italy, during, the, roman, iron, age, marking, the, farthest, extent, of, etruscan, civilization, they, were, gradually, assimilated, first, by, italics, in, the, south, then, by, celts, in, the, north, and, finally, in, etruria, itself, by, the, growing, roman, republic, that, many, roman, cities, were, formerly, etruscan, was, well, known, to, all, the, roman, authors, some, cities, were, founded, by, etruscans, in, prehistoric, times, and, bore, entirely, etruscan, names, others, were, colonized, by, etruscans, who, etruscanized, the, name, usually, italic, the, etruscans, were, aware, of, the, techniques, of, water, accumulation, and, conservation, in, egypt, mesopotamia, and, greece, they, built, canals, and, dams, to, irrigate, the, land, and, drained, and, reclaimed, swamps, the, archaeological, remains, of, this, infrastructure, are, still, evident, in, the, maritime, southwestern, parts, of, tuscany, vite, maritata, is, a, viticulture, technique, exploiting, companion, planting, named, after, the, maremma, region, of, italy, which, may, be, relevant, to, climate, change, it, was, developed, around, the, area, by, these, early, predecessors, of, the, romans, who, cultivated, plant, as, nearly, as, possible, in, their, natural, habitat, the, vines, from, which, wine, is, made, are, a, kind, of, liana, that, naturally, intertwine, with, trees, such, as, maples, or, willows, the, etruscan, system, of, belief, was, an, immanent, polytheism, that, is, all, visible, phenomena, were, considered, to, be, a, manifestation, of, divine, power, and, that, power, was, subdivided, into, deities, that, acted, continually, on, the, world, of, man, and, could, be, dissuaded, or, persuaded, in, favor, of, human, affairs, how, to, understand, the, will, of, deities, and, how, to, behave, had, been, revealed, to, the, etruscans, by, two, initiators, tages, a, childlike, figure, born, from, tilled, land, and, immediately, gifted, with, prescience, and, vegoia, a, female, figure, their, teachings, were, kept, in, a, series, of, sacred, books, three, layers, of, deities, are, evident, in, the, extensive, etruscan, art, motifs, one, appears, to, be, divinities, of, an, indigenous, nature, catha, and, usil, the, sun, tivr, the, moon, selvans, a, civil, god, turan, the, goddess, of, love, laran, the, god, of, war, leinth, the, goddess, of, death, maris, thalna, turms, and, the, ever, popular, fufluns, whose, name, is, related, in, some, way, to, the, city, of, populonia, and, the, populus, romanus, possibly, the, god, of, the, people, ruling, over, this, pantheon, of, lesser, deities, were, higher, ones, that, seem, to, reflect, the, indo, european, system, tin, or, tinia, the, sky, uni, his, wife, juno, and, cel, the, earth, goddess, in, addition, some, greek, and, roman, gods, were, inspired, by, the, etruscan, system, aritimi, artemis, menrva, minerva, pacha, dionysus, the, greek, heroes, taken, from, homer, also, appear, extensively, in, art, motifs, relatively, little, is, known, about, the, architecture, of, the, ancient, etruscans, they, adapted, the, native, italic, styles, with, influence, from, the, external, appearance, of, greek, architecture, in, turn, ancient, roman, architecture, began, with, etruscan, styles, and, then, accepted, still, further, greek, influence, roman, temples, show, many, of, the, same, differences, in, form, to, greek, ones, that, etruscan, temples, do, but, like, the, greeks, use, stone, in, which, they, closely, copy, greek, conventions, the, houses, of, the, wealthy, were, evidently, often, large, and, comfortable, but, the, burial, chambers, of, tombs, often, filled, with, grave, goods, are, the, nearest, approach, to, them, to, survive, in, the, southern, etruscan, area, tombs, have, large, rock, cut, chambers, under, a, tumulus, in, large, necropoleis, and, these, together, with, some, city, walls, are, the, only, etruscan, constructions, to, survive, etruscan, architecture, is, not, generally, considered, as, part, of, the, body, of, greco, roman, classical, architecture, etruscan, art, was, produced, by, the, etruscan, civilization, between, the, 9th, and, 2nd, centuries, bc, particularly, strong, in, this, tradition, were, figurative, sculpture, in, terracotta, particularly, lifesize, on, sarcophagi, or, temples, wall, painting, and, metalworking, especially, engraved, bronze, mirrors, etruscan, sculpture, in, cast, bronze, was, famous, and, widely, exported, but, few, large, examples, have, survived, the, material, was, too, valuable, and, recycled, later, in, contrast, to, terracotta, and, bronze, there, was, apparently, little, etruscan, sculpture, in, stone, despite, the, etruscans, controlling, fine, sources, of, marble, including, carrara, marble, which, seems, not, to, have, been, exploited, until, the, romans, most, surviving, etruscan, art, comes, from, tombs, including, all, the, fresco, wall, paintings, a, minority, of, which, show, scenes, of, feasting, and, some, narrative, mythological, subjects, bucchero, wares, in, black, were, the, early, and, native, styles, of, fine, etruscan, pottery, there, was, also, a, tradition, of, elaborate, etruscan, vase, painting, which, sprung, from, its, greek, equivalent, the, etruscans, were, the, main, export, market, for, greek, vases, etruscan, temples, were, heavily, decorated, with, colorfully, painted, terracotta, antefixes, and, other, fittings, which, survive, in, large, numbers, where, the, wooden, superstructure, has, vanished, etruscan, art, was, strongly, connected, to, religion, the, afterlife, was, of, major, importance, in, etruscan, art, the, etruscan, musical, instruments, seen, in, frescoes, and, bas, reliefs, are, different, types, of, pipes, such, as, the, plagiaulos, the, pipes, of, pan, or, syrinx, the, alabaster, pipe, and, the, famous, double, pipes, accompanied, on, percussion, instruments, such, as, the, tintinnabulum, tympanum, and, crotales, and, later, by, stringed, instruments, like, the, lyre, and, kithara, etruscans, left, around, 13, 000, inscriptions, which, have, been, found, so, far, only, a, small, minority, of, which, are, of, significant, length, attested, from, 700, bc, to, ad, 50, the, relation, of, etruscan, to, other, languages, has, been, a, source, of, long, running, speculation, and, study, the, etruscans, are, believed, to, have, spoken, a, pre, indo, european, and, paleo, european, language, and, the, majority, consensus, is, that, etruscan, is, related, only, to, other, members, of, what, is, called, the, tyrsenian, language, family, which, in, itself, is, an, isolate, family, that, is, unrelated, directly, to, other, known, language, groups, since, rix, 1998, it, is, widely, accepted, that, the, tyrsenian, family, groups, raetic, and, lemnian, are, related, to, etruscan, etruscan, texts, written, in, a, space, of, seven, centuries, use, a, form, of, the, greek, alphabet, due, to, close, contact, between, the, etruscans, and, the, greek, colonies, at, pithecusae, and, cumae, in, the, 8th, century, bc, until, it, was, no, longer, used, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1st, century, ad, etruscan, inscriptions, disappeared, from, chiusi, perugia, and, arezzo, around, this, time, only, a, few, fragments, survive, religious, and, especially, funeral, texts, most, of, which, are, late, from, the, 4th, century, bc, in, addition, to, the, original, texts, that, have, survived, to, this, day, there, are, a, large, number, of, quotations, and, allusions, from, classical, authors, in, the, 1st, century, bc, diodorus, siculus, wrote, that, literary, culture, was, one, of, the, great, achievements, of, the, etruscans, little, is, known, of, it, and, even, what, is, known, of, their, language, is, due, to, the, repetition, of, the, same, few, words, in, the, many, inscriptions, found, by, way, of, the, modern, epitaphs, contrasted, in, bilingual, or, trilingual, texts, with, latin, and, punic, out, of, the, aforementioned, genres, is, just, one, such, volnio, volnius, cited, in, classical, sources, mentioned, with, a, few, exceptions, such, as, the, liber, linteus, the, only, written, records, in, the, etruscan, language, that, remain, are, inscriptions, mainly, funerary, the, language, is, written, in, the, etruscan, alphabet, a, script, related, to, the, early, euboean, greek, alphabet, many, thousand, inscriptions, in, etruscan, are, known, mostly, epitaphs, and, a, few, very, short, texts, have, survived, which, are, mainly, religious, etruscan, imaginative, literature, is, evidenced, only, in, references, by, later, roman, authors, but, it, is, evident, from, their, visual, art, that, the, greek, myths, were, well, known, with, the, founding, of, pithekussai, on, ischia, and, kyme, lat, cumae, in, campania, in, the, course, of, the, greek, colonization, the, etruscans, came, under, the, influence, of, the, greek, culture, in, the, 8th, century, bc, the, etruscans, adopted, an, alphabet, from, the, western, greek, colonists, that, came, from, their, homeland, the, euboean, chalkis, this, alphabet, from, cumae, is, therefore, also, called, euboean, or, chalcidian, alphabet, the, oldest, written, records, of, the, etruscans, date, from, around, 700, bc, one, of, the, oldest, etruscan, written, documents, is, found, on, the, tablet, of, marsiliana, d, albegna, from, the, hinterland, of, vulci, which, is, now, kept, in, the, national, archaeological, museum, of, florence, a, western, greek, model, alphabet, is, engraved, on, the, edge, of, this, wax, tablet, made, of, ivory, in, accordance, with, later, etruscan, writing, habits, the, letters, in, this, model, alphabet, were, mirrored, and, arranged, from, right, to, left, the, script, with, these, letters, was, first, used, in, southern, etruria, around, 700, bc, in, the, etruscan, cisra, lat, caere, today, s, cerveteri, the, science, of, writing, quickly, reached, central, and, northern, etruria, from, there, the, alphabet, spread, from, volterra, etr, velathri, to, felsina, today, s, bologna, and, later, from, chiusi, etr, clevsin, to, the, po, valley, in, southern, etruria, the, writing, spread, from, tarquinia, etr, tarchna, and, veii, etr, veia, further, south, to, campania, which, was, controlled, by, the, etruscans, at, the, time, in, the, following, centuries, the, etruscans, consistently, used, the, letters, mentioned, so, that, the, deciphering, of, the, etruscan, inscriptions, is, not, a, problem, as, in, greek, the, characters, were, subject, to, regional, and, temporal, changes, overall, one, can, distinguish, an, archaic, script, from, the, 7th, to, 5th, centuries, from, a, more, recent, script, from, the, 4th, to, 1st, centuries, bc, in, which, some, characters, were, no, longer, used, including, the, x, for, a, sh, sound, in, addition, in, writing, and, language, the, emphasis, on, the, first, syllable, meant, that, internal, vowels, were, not, reproduced, e, g, menrva, instead, of, menerva, accordingly, linguists, also, distinguish, between, old, and, new, etruscan, alongside, the, tablet, of, marsiliana, d, albegna, around, 70, objects, with, model, alphabets, have, been, preserved, from, the, early, period, the, most, famous, of, these, are, as, all, four, artifacts, date, from, the, 7th, century, b, c, come, from, the, alphabets, are, always, written, clockwise, the, last, object, has, the, special, feature, that, in, addition, to, the, letters, of, the, alphabet, almost, all, consonants, are, shown, in, sequence, in, connection, with, the, vowels, i, a, u, and, e, syllabary, this, syllabic, writing, system, was, probably, used, to, practice, the, written, characters, the, most, important, etruscan, written, monuments, that, contain, a, large, number, of, words, include, no, further, etruscan, literature, has, survived, and, from, the, early, 1st, century, ad, inscriptions, with, etruscan, characters, have, ceased, to, exist, all, existing, ancient, etruscan, written, documents, are, systematically, collected, in, the, corpus, inscriptionum, etruscarum, in, the, middle, of, the, 7th, century, bc, the, romans, adopted, the, etruscan, writing, system, and, letters, in, particular, they, used, the, three, different, characters, c, k, and, q, for, a, k, sound, z, was, also, initially, adopted, into, the, roman, alphabet, although, the, affricate, ts, did, not, occur, in, the, latin, language, later, z, was, replaced, in, the, alphabet, by, the, newly, formed, letter, g, which, was, derived, from, c, and, z, was, finally, placed, at, the, end, of, the, alphabet, the, letters, and, were, omitted, by, the, romans, because, the, corresponding, aspirated, sounds, did, not, occur, in, their, language, the, etruscan, alphabet, spread, across, the, northern, and, central, parts, of, the, italian, peninsula, it, is, assumed, that, the, formation, of, the, oscan, script, probably, in, the, 6th, century, bc, was, fundamentally, influenced, by, etruscan, the, characters, of, the, umbrian, faliscan, and, venetic, languages, can, also, be, traced, back, to, etruscan, alphabets, timeline
