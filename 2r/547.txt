the, treaty, of, versailles, was, a, peace, treaty, signed, on, 28, june, 1919, as, the, most, important, treaty, of, world, war, i, it, ended, the, state, of, war, between, germany, and, most, of, the, allied, powers, it, was, signed, in, the, palace, of, versailles, exactly, five, years, after, the, assassination, of, archduke, franz, ferdinand, which, led, to, the, war, the, other, central, powers, on, the, german, side, signed, separate, treaties, although, the, armistice, of, 11, november, 1918, ended, the, actual, fighting, and, agreed, certain, principles, and, conditions, including, the, payment, of, reparations, it, took, six, months, of, allied, negotiations, at, the, paris, peace, conference, to, conclude, the, peace, treaty, germany, was, not, allowed, to, participate, in, the, negotiations, before, signing, the, treaty, the, treaty, required, germany, to, disarm, make, territorial, concessions, extradite, alleged, war, criminals, agree, to, kaiser, wilhelm, being, put, on, trial, recognise, the, independence, of, states, whose, territory, had, previously, been, part, of, the, german, empire, and, pay, reparations, to, the, entente, powers, the, most, critical, and, controversial, provision, in, the, treaty, was, the, allied, and, associated, governments, affirm, and, germany, accepts, the, responsibility, of, germany, and, her, allies, for, causing, all, the, loss, and, damage, to, which, the, allied, and, associated, governments, and, their, nationals, have, been, subjected, as, a, consequence, of, the, war, imposed, upon, them, by, the, aggression, of, germany, and, her, allies, the, other, members, of, the, central, powers, signed, treaties, containing, similar, articles, this, article, article, 231, became, known, as, the, war, guilt, clause, critics, including, john, maynard, keynes, declared, the, treaty, too, harsh, styling, it, as, a, carthaginian, peace, and, saying, the, reparations, were, excessive, and, counterproductive, on, the, other, hand, prominent, allied, figures, such, as, french, marshal, ferdinand, foch, criticized, the, treaty, for, treating, germany, too, leniently, this, is, still, the, subject, of, ongoing, debate, by, historians, and, economists, the, result, of, these, competing, and, sometimes, conflicting, goals, among, the, victors, was, a, compromise, that, left, no, one, satisfied, in, particular, germany, was, neither, pacified, nor, conciliated, nor, was, it, permanently, weakened, the, united, states, never, ratified, the, versailles, treaty, and, made, a, separate, peace, treaty, with, germany, albeit, based, on, the, versailles, treaty, the, problems, that, arose, from, the, treaty, would, lead, to, the, locarno, treaties, which, improved, relations, between, germany, and, the, other, european, powers, the, reparation, system, was, reorganized, and, payments, reduced, in, the, dawes, plan, and, the, young, plan, bitter, resentment, of, the, treaty, powered, the, rise, of, the, nazi, party, and, eventually, the, outbreak, of, a, second, world, war, although, it, is, often, referred, to, as, the, versailles, conference, only, the, actual, signing, of, the, treaty, took, place, at, the, historic, palace, most, of, the, negotiations, were, in, paris, with, the, big, four, meetings, taking, place, generally, at, the, french, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, on, the, quai, d, orsay, war, broke, out, following, the, july, crisis, in, 1914, austria, hungary, declared, war, on, serbia, followed, quickly, by, germany, declaring, war, on, russia, on, 1, august, and, on, belgium, and, france, on, 3, august, the, german, invasion, of, belgium, on, 3, august, led, to, a, declaration, of, war, by, britain, on, germany, on, 4, august, creating, the, conflict, that, became, the, first, world, war, two, alliances, faced, off, the, central, powers, led, by, germany, and, the, triple, entente, led, by, britain, france, and, russia, other, countries, entered, as, fighting, raged, widely, across, europe, as, well, as, the, middle, east, africa, and, asia, having, seen, the, overthrow, of, the, tsarist, regime, in, the, february, revolution, and, the, kerensky, government, in, the, october, revolution, the, new, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, under, vladimir, lenin, in, march, 1918, signed, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, amounting, to, a, surrender, that, was, highly, favourable, to, germany, sensing, victory, before, the, american, expeditionary, forces, could, be, ready, germany, now, shifted, forces, to, the, western, front, and, tried, to, overwhelm, the, allies, it, failed, instead, the, allies, won, decisively, on, the, battlefield, overwhelmed, germany, s, turkish, austrian, and, bulgarian, allies, and, forced, an, armistice, in, november, 1918, that, resembled, a, surrender, the, united, states, entered, the, war, against, the, central, powers, in, 1917, and, president, woodrow, wilson, played, a, significant, role, in, shaping, the, peace, terms, his, expressed, aim, was, to, detach, the, war, from, nationalistic, disputes, and, ambitions, on, 8, january, 1918, wilson, issued, the, fourteen, points, they, outlined, a, policy, of, free, trade, open, agreements, and, democracy, while, the, term, was, not, used, self, determination, was, assumed, it, called, for, a, negotiated, end, to, the, war, international, disarmament, the, withdrawal, of, the, central, powers, from, occupied, territories, the, creation, of, a, polish, state, the, redrawing, of, europe, s, borders, along, ethnic, lines, and, the, formation, of, a, league, of, nations, to, guarantee, the, political, independence, and, territorial, integrity, of, all, states, it, called, for, what, it, characterised, as, a, just, and, democratic, peace, uncompromised, by, territorial, annexation, the, fourteen, points, were, based, on, the, research, of, the, inquiry, a, team, of, about, 150, advisors, led, by, foreign, policy, advisor, edward, m, house, into, the, topics, likely, to, arise, in, the, expected, peace, conference, during, the, autumn, of, 1918, the, central, powers, began, to, collapse, desertion, rates, within, the, german, army, began, to, increase, and, civilian, strikes, drastically, reduced, war, production, on, the, western, front, the, allied, forces, launched, the, hundred, days, offensive, and, decisively, defeated, the, german, western, armies, sailors, of, the, imperial, german, navy, at, kiel, mutinied, in, response, to, the, naval, order, of, 24, october, 1918, which, prompted, uprisings, in, germany, which, became, known, as, the, german, revolution, the, german, government, tried, to, obtain, a, peace, settlement, based, on, the, fourteen, points, and, maintained, it, was, on, this, basis, that, they, surrendered, following, negotiations, the, allied, powers, and, germany, signed, an, armistice, which, came, into, effect, on, 11, november, while, german, forces, were, still, positioned, in, france, and, belgium, many, aspects, of, the, versailles, treaty, that, were, later, criticised, were, agreed, first, in, the, 11, november, armistice, agreement, whilst, the, war, was, still, ongoing, these, included, the, german, evacuation, of, german, occupied, france, belgium, luxembourg, alsace, lorraine, and, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, all, of, which, were, to, be, administered, by, the, allies, under, the, armistice, agreement, the, surrender, of, a, large, quantity, of, war, materiel, and, the, agreed, payment, of, reparation, for, damage, done, german, forces, evacuated, occupied, france, belgium, and, luxembourg, within, the, fifteen, days, required, by, the, armistice, agreement, by, late, 1918, allied, troops, had, entered, germany, and, began, the, occupation, of, the, rhineland, under, the, agreement, in, the, process, establishing, bridgeheads, across, the, rhine, in, case, of, renewed, fighting, at, cologne, koblenz, and, mainz, allied, and, german, forces, were, additionally, to, be, separated, by, a, 10, km, wide, demilitarised, zone, both, germany, and, great, britain, were, dependent, on, imports, of, food, and, raw, materials, most, of, which, had, to, be, shipped, across, the, atlantic, ocean, the, blockade, of, germany, was, a, naval, operation, conducted, by, the, allied, powers, to, stop, the, supply, of, raw, materials, and, foodstuffs, reaching, the, central, powers, the, german, kaiserliche, marine, was, mainly, restricted, to, the, german, bight, and, used, commerce, raiders, and, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, for, a, counter, blockade, the, german, board, of, public, health, in, december, 1918, stated, that, 763, 000, german, civilians, had, died, during, the, allied, blockade, although, an, academic, study, in, 1928, put, the, death, toll, at, 424, 000, people, the, blockade, was, maintained, for, eight, months, after, the, armistice, in, november, 1918, into, the, following, year, of, 1919, foodstuffs, imports, into, germany, were, controlled, by, the, allies, after, the, armistice, with, germany, until, germany, signed, the, treaty, of, versailles, in, june, 1919, in, march, 1919, churchill, informed, the, house, of, commons, that, the, ongoing, blockade, was, a, success, and, germany, is, very, near, starvation, from, january, 1919, to, march, 1919, germany, refused, to, agree, to, allied, demands, that, germany, surrender, its, merchant, ships, to, allied, ports, to, transport, food, supplies, some, germans, considered, the, armistice, to, be, a, temporary, cessation, of, the, war, and, knew, if, fighting, broke, out, again, their, ships, would, be, seized, over, the, winter, of, 1919, the, situation, became, desperate, and, germany, finally, agreed, to, surrender, its, fleet, in, march, the, allies, then, allowed, for, the, import, of, 270, 000, tons, of, foodstuffs, both, german, and, non, german, observers, have, argued, that, these, were, the, most, devastating, months, of, the, blockade, for, german, civilians, though, disagreement, persists, as, to, the, extent, and, who, is, truly, at, fault, according, to, max, rubner, 100, 000, german, civilians, died, due, to, the, continuation, blockade, after, the, armistice, in, the, uk, labour, party, member, and, anti, war, activist, robert, smillie, issued, a, statement, in, june, 1919, condemning, continuation, of, the, blockade, claiming, 100, 000, german, civilians, had, died, as, a, result, talks, between, the, allies, to, establish, a, common, negotiating, position, started, on, 18, january, 1919, in, the, salle, de, l, horloge, clock, room, at, the, french, foreign, ministry, on, the, quai, d, orsay, in, paris, initially, 70, delegates, from, 27, nations, participated, in, the, negotiations, russia, was, excluded, due, to, their, signing, of, a, separate, peace, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, and, early, withdrawal, from, the, war, furthermore, german, negotiators, were, excluded, to, deny, them, an, opportunity, to, divide, the, allies, diplomatically, initially, a, council, of, ten, comprising, two, delegates, each, from, britain, france, the, united, states, italy, and, japan, met, officially, to, decide, the, peace, terms, this, council, was, replaced, by, the, council, of, five, formed, from, each, country, s, foreign, ministers, to, discuss, minor, matters, french, prime, minister, georges, clemenceau, italian, prime, minister, vittorio, emanuele, orlando, british, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, and, united, states, president, woodrow, wilson, formed, the, big, four, at, one, point, becoming, the, big, three, following, the, temporary, withdrawal, of, orlando, these, four, men, met, in, 145, closed, sessions, to, make, all, the, major, decisions, which, were, later, ratified, by, the, entire, assembly, the, minor, powers, attended, a, weekly, plenary, conference, that, discussed, issues, in, a, general, forum, but, made, no, decisions, these, members, formed, over, 50, commissions, that, made, various, recommendations, many, of, which, were, incorporated, into, the, final, text, of, the, treaty, france, had, lost, 1, 3, million, soldiers, including, 25, of, french, men, aged, 18, 30, as, well, as, 400, 000, civilians, france, had, also, been, more, physically, damaged, than, any, other, nation, the, so, called, zone, rouge, red, zone, the, most, industrialized, region, and, the, source, of, most, coal, and, iron, ore, in, the, north, east, had, been, devastated, and, in, the, final, days, of, the, war, mines, had, been, flooded, and, railways, bridges, and, factories, destroyed, clemenceau, intended, to, ensure, the, security, of, france, by, weakening, germany, economically, militarily, territorially, and, by, supplanting, germany, as, the, leading, producer, of, steel, in, europe, british, economist, and, versailles, negotiator, john, maynard, keynes, summarized, this, position, as, attempting, to, set, the, clock, back, and, undo, what, since, 1870, the, progress, of, germany, had, accomplished, clemenceau, told, wilson, america, is, far, away, protected, by, the, ocean, not, even, napoleon, himself, could, touch, england, you, are, both, sheltered, we, are, not, the, french, wanted, a, frontier, on, the, rhine, to, protect, france, from, a, german, invasion, and, compensate, for, french, demographic, and, economic, inferiority, american, and, british, representatives, refused, the, french, claim, and, after, two, months, of, negotiations, the, french, accepted, a, british, pledge, to, provide, an, immediate, alliance, with, france, if, germany, attacked, again, and, wilson, agreed, to, put, a, similar, proposal, to, the, senate, clemenceau, had, told, the, chamber, of, deputies, in, december, 1918, that, his, goal, was, to, maintain, an, alliance, with, both, countries, clemenceau, accepted, the, offer, in, return, for, an, occupation, of, the, rhineland, for, fifteen, years, and, that, germany, would, also, demilitarise, the, rhineland, french, negotiators, required, reparations, to, make, germany, pay, for, the, destruction, induced, throughout, the, war, and, to, decrease, german, strength, the, french, also, wanted, the, iron, ore, and, coal, of, the, saar, valley, by, annexation, to, france, the, french, were, willing, to, accept, a, smaller, amount, of, world, war, i, reparations, than, the, americans, would, concede, and, clemenceau, was, willing, to, discuss, german, capacity, to, pay, with, the, german, delegation, before, the, final, settlement, was, drafted, in, april, and, may, 1919, the, french, and, germans, held, separate, talks, on, mutually, acceptable, arrangements, on, issues, like, reparation, reconstruction, and, industrial, collaboration, france, along, with, the, british, dominions, and, belgium, opposed, league, of, nations, mandates, and, favored, annexation, of, former, german, colonies, the, french, who, had, suffered, significantly, in, the, areas, occupied, by, germany, during, the, war, were, in, favour, of, trying, german, war, criminals, including, the, kaiser, in, the, face, of, american, objections, that, there, was, no, applicable, existing, law, under, which, the, kaiser, could, be, tried, clemenceau, took, the, view, that, the, law, of, responsibility, overruled, all, other, laws, and, that, putting, the, kaiser, on, trial, offered, the, opportunity, to, establish, this, as, an, international, precedent, britain, had, suffered, heavy, financial, costs, but, suffered, little, physical, devastation, during, the, war, british, public, opinion, wanted, to, make, germany, pay, for, the, war, public, opinion, favoured, a, just, peace, which, would, force, germany, to, pay, reparations, and, be, unable, to, repeat, the, aggression, of, 1914, although, those, of, a, liberal, and, advanced, opinion, shared, wilson, s, ideal, of, a, peace, of, reconciliation, in, private, lloyd, george, opposed, revenge, and, attempted, to, compromise, between, clemenceau, s, demands, and, the, fourteen, points, because, europe, would, eventually, have, to, reconcile, with, germany, lloyd, george, wanted, terms, of, reparation, that, would, not, cripple, the, german, economy, so, that, germany, would, remain, a, viable, economic, power, and, trading, partner, by, arguing, that, british, war, pensions, and, widows, allowances, should, be, included, in, the, german, reparation, sum, lloyd, george, ensured, that, a, large, amount, would, go, to, the, british, empire, lloyd, george, also, intended, to, maintain, a, european, balance, of, power, to, thwart, a, french, attempt, to, establish, itself, as, the, dominant, european, power, a, revived, germany, would, be, a, counterweight, to, france, and, a, deterrent, to, bolshevik, russia, lloyd, george, also, wanted, to, neutralize, the, german, navy, to, keep, the, royal, navy, as, the, greatest, naval, power, in, the, world, dismantle, the, german, colonial, empire, with, several, of, its, territorial, possessions, ceded, to, britain, and, others, being, established, as, league, of, nations, mandates, a, position, opposed, by, the, dominions, together, with, the, french, the, british, favoured, putting, german, war, criminals, on, trial, and, included, the, kaiser, in, this, already, in, 1916, herbert, asquith, had, declared, the, intention, to, bring, to, justice, the, criminals, whoever, they, be, and, whatever, their, station, and, a, resolution, of, the, war, cabinet, in, 1918, reaffirmed, this, intent, lloyd, george, declared, that, the, british, people, would, not, accept, a, treaty, that, did, not, include, terms, on, this, though, he, wished, to, limit, the, charges, solely, to, violation, of, the, 1839, treaty, guaranteeing, belgian, neutrality, the, british, were, also, well, aware, that, the, kaiser, having, sought, refuge, in, the, netherlands, meant, that, any, trial, was, unlikely, to, take, place, and, therefore, any, article, demanding, it, was, likely, to, be, a, dead, letter, before, the, american, entry, into, the, war, wilson, had, talked, of, a, peace, without, victory, this, position, fluctuated, following, the, us, entry, into, the, war, wilson, spoke, of, the, german, aggressors, with, whom, there, could, be, no, compromised, peace, on, 8, january, 1918, however, wilson, delivered, a, speech, known, as, the, fourteen, points, that, declared, the, american, peace, objectives, the, rebuilding, of, the, european, economy, self, determination, of, european, and, middle, eastern, ethnic, groups, the, promotion, of, free, trade, the, creation, of, appropriate, mandates, for, former, colonies, and, above, all, the, creation, of, a, powerful, league, of, nations, that, would, ensure, the, peace, the, aim, of, the, latter, was, to, provide, a, forum, to, revise, the, peace, treaties, as, needed, and, deal, with, problems, that, arose, as, a, result, of, the, peace, and, the, rise, of, new, states, wilson, brought, along, top, intellectuals, as, advisors, to, the, american, peace, delegation, and, the, overall, american, position, echoed, the, fourteen, points, wilson, firmly, opposed, harsh, treatment, on, germany, while, the, british, and, french, wanted, to, largely, annex, the, german, colonial, empire, wilson, saw, that, as, a, violation, of, the, fundamental, principles, of, justice, and, human, rights, of, the, native, populations, and, favored, them, having, the, right, of, self, determination, via, the, creation, of, mandates, the, promoted, idea, called, for, the, major, powers, to, act, as, disinterested, trustees, over, a, region, aiding, the, native, populations, until, they, could, govern, themselves, in, spite, of, this, position, and, in, order, to, ensure, that, japan, did, not, refuse, to, join, the, league, of, nations, wilson, favored, turning, over, the, former, german, colony, of, shandong, in, eastern, china, to, the, japanese, empire, rather, than, return, the, area, to, the, republic, of, china, s, control, further, confounding, the, americans, was, us, internal, partisan, politics, in, november, 1918, the, republican, party, won, the, senate, election, by, a, slim, margin, wilson, a, democrat, refused, to, include, prominent, republicans, in, the, american, delegation, making, his, efforts, seem, partisan, and, contributed, to, a, risk, of, political, defeat, at, home, on, the, subject, of, war, crimes, the, americans, differed, to, the, british, and, french, in, that, wilson, s, proposal, was, that, any, trial, of, the, kaiser, should, be, solely, a, political, and, moral, affair, and, not, one, of, criminal, responsibility, meaning, that, the, death, penalty, would, be, precluded, this, was, based, on, the, american, view, particularly, those, of, robert, lansing, that, there, was, no, applicable, law, under, which, the, kaiser, could, be, tried, additionally, the, americans, favoured, trying, other, german, war, criminals, before, military, tribunals, rather, than, an, international, court, with, prosecutions, being, limited, to, violation, of, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, and, opposed, any, trials, based, on, violations, against, what, was, called, laws, of, humanity, vittorio, emanuele, orlando, and, his, foreign, minister, sidney, sonnino, an, anglican, of, british, origins, worked, primarily, to, secure, the, partition, of, the, habsburg, empire, and, their, attitude, towards, germany, was, not, as, hostile, generally, speaking, sonnino, was, in, line, with, the, british, position, while, orlando, favored, a, compromise, between, clemenceau, and, wilson, within, the, negotiations, for, the, treaty, of, versailles, orlando, obtained, certain, results, such, as, the, permanent, membership, of, italy, in, the, security, council, of, the, league, of, nations, and, a, promised, transfer, of, british, jubaland, and, french, aozou, strip, to, the, italian, colonies, of, somalia, and, libya, respectively, italian, nationalists, however, saw, the, war, as, a, mutilated, victory, for, what, they, considered, to, be, little, territorial, gains, achieved, in, the, other, treaties, directly, impacting, italy, s, borders, orlando, was, ultimately, forced, to, abandon, the, conference, and, resign, orlando, refused, to, see, world, war, i, as, a, mutilated, victory, replying, at, nationalists, calling, for, a, greater, expansion, that, italy, today, is, a, great, state, on, par, with, the, great, historic, and, contemporary, states, this, is, for, me, our, main, and, principal, expansion, francesco, saverio, nitti, took, orlando, s, place, in, signing, the, treaty, of, versailles, the, italian, leadership, were, divided, on, whether, to, try, the, kaiser, sonnino, considered, that, putting, the, kaiser, on, trial, could, result, in, him, becoming, a, patriotic, martyr, orlando, in, contrast, stated, that, the, ex, kaiser, ought, to, pay, like, other, criminals, but, was, less, sure, about, whether, the, kaiser, should, be, tried, as, a, criminal, or, merely, have, a, political, verdict, cast, against, him, orlando, also, considered, that, he, question, of, the, constitution, of, the, court, presents, almost, insurmountable, difficulties, in, june, 1919, the, allies, declared, that, war, would, resume, if, the, german, government, did, not, sign, the, treaty, they, had, agreed, to, among, themselves, the, government, headed, by, philipp, scheidemann, was, unable, to, agree, on, a, common, position, and, scheidemann, himself, resigned, rather, than, agree, to, sign, the, treaty, gustav, bauer, the, head, of, the, new, government, sent, a, telegram, stating, his, intention, to, sign, the, treaty, if, certain, articles, were, withdrawn, including, articles, 227, to, 231, i, e, the, articles, related, to, the, extradition, of, the, kaiser, for, trial, the, extradition, of, german, war, criminals, for, trial, before, allied, tribunals, the, handing, over, of, documents, relevant, for, war, crimes, trials, and, accepting, liability, for, war, reparations, in, response, the, allies, issued, an, ultimatum, stating, that, germany, would, have, to, accept, the, treaty, or, face, an, invasion, of, allied, forces, across, the, rhine, within, 24, hours, on, 23, june, bauer, capitulated, and, sent, a, second, telegram, with, a, confirmation, that, a, german, delegation, would, arrive, shortly, to, sign, the, treaty, on, 28, june, 1919, the, fifth, anniversary, of, the, assassination, of, archduke, franz, ferdinand, the, immediate, impetus, for, the, war, the, peace, treaty, was, signed, the, treaty, had, clauses, ranging, from, war, crimes, the, prohibition, on, the, merging, of, the, republic, of, german, austria, with, germany, without, the, consent, of, the, league, of, nations, freedom, of, navigation, on, major, european, rivers, to, the, returning, of, a, quran, to, the, king, of, hedjaz, the, treaty, stripped, germany, of, 65, 000, km, 2, 25, 000, sq, mi, of, territory, and, 7, million, people, it, also, required, germany, to, give, up, the, gains, made, via, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, and, grant, independence, to, the, protectorates, that, had, been, established, in, western, europe, germany, was, required, to, recognize, belgian, sovereignty, over, moresnet, and, cede, control, of, the, eupen, malmedy, area, within, six, months, of, the, transfer, belgium, was, required, to, conduct, a, plebiscite, on, whether, the, citizens, of, the, region, wanted, to, remain, under, belgian, sovereignty, or, return, to, german, control, communicate, the, results, to, the, league, of, nations, and, abide, by, the, league, s, decision, the, belgian, transitional, administration, under, high, commissioner, general, herman, baltia, was, responsible, for, the, organisation, and, control, of, this, process, held, between, january, and, june, 1920, the, plebiscite, itself, was, held, without, a, secret, ballot, and, organized, as, a, consultation, in, which, all, citizens, who, opposed, the, annexation, had,

felt, that, the, french, would, keep, europe, in, a, constant, state, of, turmoil, by, attempting, to, enforce, the, treaty, delegate, harold, nicolson, wrote, are, we, making, a, good, peace, while, general, jan, smuts, a, member, of, the, south, african, delegation, wrote, to, lloyd, george, before, the, signing, that, the, treaty, was, unstable, and, declared, are, we, in, our, sober, senses, or, suffering, from, shellshock, what, has, become, of, wilson, s, 14, points, he, wanted, the, germans, not, be, made, to, sign, at, the, point, of, the, bayonet, smuts, issued, a, statement,

many, within, the, foreign, office, were, disappointed, by, the, treaty, the, treaty, received, widespread, approval, from, the, general, public, bernadotte, schmitt, wrote, that, the, average, englishman, thought, germany, got, only, what, it, deserved, as, a, result, of, the, treaty, but, public, opinion, changed, as, german, complaints, mounted, former, wartime, british, prime, minister, h, h, asquith, and, the, independent, liberal, opposition, in, the, british, parliament, after, the, 1918, general, election, believed, the, treaty, was, too, punitive, asquith, campaigned, against, it, while, running, for, another, house, of, commons, seat, in, the, 1920, paisley, by, election, prime, minister, ramsay, macdonald, following, the, german, re, militarisation, of, the, rhineland, in, 1936, stated, that, he, was, pleased, that, the, treaty, was, vanishing, expressing, his, hope, that, the, french, had, been, taught, a, severe, lesson, the, treaty, of, versailles, was, an, important, step, in, the, status, of, the, british, dominions, under, international, law, australia, canada, new, zealand, and, south, africa, had, each, made, significant, contributions, to, the, british, war, effort, but, as, separate, countries, rather, than, as, british, colonies, india, also, made, a, substantial, troop, contribution, although, under, direct, british, control, unlike, the, dominions, the, four, dominions, and, india, all, signed, the, treaty, separately, from, britain, a, clear, recognition, by, the, international, community, that, the, dominions, were, no, longer, british, colonies, their, status, defied, exact, analysis, by, both, international, and, constitutional, lawyers, but, it, was, clear, that, they, were, no, longer, regarded, simply, as, colonies, of, britain, by, signing, the, treaty, individually, the, four, dominions, and, india, also, were, founding, members, of, the, league, of, nations, in, their, own, right, rather, than, simply, as, part, of, the, british, empire, the, signing, of, the, treaty, was, met, with, roars, of, approval, singing, and, dancing, from, a, crowd, outside, the, palace, of, versailles, in, paris, proper, people, rejoiced, at, the, official, end, of, the, war, the, return, of, alsace, and, lorraine, to, france, and, that, germany, had, agreed, to, pay, reparations, while, france, ratified, the, treaty, and, was, active, in, the, league, the, jubilant, mood, soon, gave, way, to, a, political, backlash, for, clemenceau, the, french, right, saw, the, treaty, as, being, too, lenient, and, saw, it, as, failing, to, achieve, all, of, france, s, demands, left, wing, politicians, attacked, the, treaty, and, clemenceau, for, being, too, harsh, the, latter, turning, into, a, ritual, condemnation, of, the, treaty, for, politicians, remarking, on, french, foreign, affairs, as, late, as, august, 1939, marshal, ferdinand, foch, stated, this, treaty, is, not, peace, it, is, an, armistice, for, twenty, years, a, criticism, over, the, failure, to, annex, the, rhineland, and, for, compromising, french, security, for, the, benefit, of, the, united, states, and, britain, when, clemenceau, stood, for, election, as, president, of, france, in, january, 1920, he, was, defeated, reaction, in, the, kingdom, of, italy, to, the, treaty, was, extremely, negative, the, country, had, suffered, high, casualties, yet, failed, to, achieve, most, of, its, major, war, goals, notably, gaining, control, of, the, dalmatian, coast, and, fiume, president, wilson, rejected, italy, s, claims, on, the, basis, of, national, self, determination, for, their, part, britain, and, france, who, had, been, forced, in, the, war, s, latter, stages, to, divert, their, own, troops, to, the, italian, front, to, stave, off, collapse, were, disinclined, to, support, italy, s, position, at, the, peace, conference, differences, in, negotiating, strategy, between, premier, vittorio, orlando, and, foreign, minister, sidney, sonnino, further, undermined, italy, s, position, at, the, conference, a, furious, vittorio, orlando, suffered, a, nervous, collapse, and, at, one, point, walked, out, of, the, conference, though, he, later, returned, he, lost, his, position, as, prime, minister, just, a, week, before, the, treaty, was, scheduled, to, be, signed, effectively, ending, his, active, political, career, anger, and, dismay, over, the, treaty, s, provisions, helped, pave, the, way, for, the, establishment, of, benito, mussolini, s, fascist, dictatorship, three, years, later, portugal, entered, the, war, on, the, allied, side, in, 1916, primarily, to, ensure, the, security, of, its, african, colonies, which, were, threatened, with, seizure, by, both, britain, and, germany, to, this, extent, she, succeeded, in, her, war, aims, the, treaty, recognized, portuguese, sovereignty, over, these, areas, and, awarded, her, small, portions, of, germany, s, bordering, overseas, colonies, including, the, kionga, triangle, otherwise, portugal, gained, little, at, the, peace, conference, her, promised, share, of, german, reparations, never, materialized, and, a, seat, she, coveted, on, the, executive, council, of, the, new, league, of, nations, went, instead, to, spain, which, had, remained, neutral, in, the, war, in, the, end, portugal, ratified, the, treaty, but, got, little, out, of, the, war, which, cost, more, than, 8, 000, portuguese, armed, forces, troops, and, as, many, as, 100, 000, of, her, african, colonial, subjects, their, lives, after, the, versailles, conference, democratic, president, woodrow, wilson, claimed, that, at, last, the, world, knows, america, as, the, savior, of, the, world, however, wilson, had, refused, to, bring, any, leading, members, of, the, republican, party, led, by, henry, cabot, lodge, into, the, talks, the, republicans, controlled, the, united, states, senate, after, the, election, of, 1918, and, were, outraged, by, wilson, s, refusal, to, discuss, the, war, with, them, the, senators, were, divided, into, multiple, positions, on, the, versailles, question, it, proved, possible, to, build, a, majority, coalition, but, impossible, to, build, a, two, thirds, coalition, that, was, needed, to, pass, a, treaty, a, discontent, bloc, of, 12, 18, irreconcilables, mostly, republicans, but, also, representatives, of, the, irish, and, german, democrats, fiercely, opposed, the, treaty, one, bloc, of, democrats, strongly, supported, the, versailles, treaty, even, with, reservations, added, by, lodge, a, second, group, of, democrats, supported, the, treaty, but, followed, wilson, in, opposing, any, amendments, or, reservations, the, largest, bloc, led, by, senator, lodge, comprised, a, majority, of, the, republicans, they, wanted, a, treaty, with, reservations, especially, on, article, 10, so, that, the, league, of, nations, could, not, draw, the, us, into, war, without, the, of, the, us, congress, all, of, the, irreconcilables, were, bitter, enemies, of, president, wilson, and, he, launched, a, nationwide, speaking, tour, in, the, summer, of, 1919, to, refute, them, but, wilson, collapsed, midway, with, a, serious, stroke, that, effectively, ruined, his, leadership, skills, the, closest, the, treaty, came, to, passage, was, on, 19, november, 1919, as, lodge, and, his, republicans, formed, a, coalition, with, the, pro, treaty, democrats, and, were, close, to, a, two, thirds, majority, for, a, treaty, with, reservations, but, wilson, rejected, this, compromise, and, enough, democrats, followed, his, lead, to, end, the, chances, of, ratification, permanently, among, the, american, public, as, a, whole, the, irish, catholics, and, the, german, americans, were, intensely, opposed, to, the, treaty, saying, it, favored, the, british, after, wilson, s, presidency, his, successor, republican, president, warren, g, harding, continued, american, opposition, to, the, formation, of, the, league, of, nations, congress, subsequently, passed, the, knox, porter, resolution, bringing, a, formal, end, to, hostilities, between, the, united, states, and, the, central, powers, it, was, signed, into, law, by, president, harding, on, 2, july, 1921, soon, after, the, us, german, peace, treaty, of, 1921, was, signed, in, berlin, on, 25, august, 1921, article, 1, of, this, treaty, obliged, the, german, government, to, grant, to, the, u, s, government, all, rights, and, privileges, that, were, enjoyed, by, the, other, allies, that, had, ratified, the, versailles, treaty, two, similar, treaties, were, signed, with, austria, and, hungary, on, 24, and, 29, august, 1921, in, vienna, and, budapest, respectively, wilson, s, former, friend, edward, mandell, house, present, at, the, negotiations, wrote, in, his, diary, on, 29, june, 1919, i, am, leaving, paris, after, eight, fateful, months, with, conflicting, emotions, looking, at, the, conference, in, retrospect, there, is, much, to, approve, and, yet, much, to, regret, it, is, easy, to, say, what, should, have, been, done, but, more, difficult, to, have, found, a, way, of, doing, it, to, those, who, are, saying, that, the, treaty, is, bad, and, should, never, have, been, made, and, that, it, will, involve, europe, in, infinite, difficulties, in, its, enforcement, i, feel, like, admitting, it, but, i, would, also, say, in, reply, that, empires, cannot, be, shattered, and, new, states, raised, upon, their, ruins, without, disturbance, to, create, new, boundaries, is, to, create, new, troubles, the, one, follows, the, other, while, i, should, have, preferred, a, different, peace, i, doubt, very, much, whether, it, could, have, been, made, for, the, ingredients, required, for, such, a, peace, as, i, would, have, were, lacking, at, paris, many, in, china, felt, betrayed, as, the, german, territory, in, china, was, handed, to, japan, wellington, koo, refused, to, sign, the, treaty, and, the, chinese, delegation, at, the, paris, peace, conference, was, the, only, nation, that, did, not, sign, the, treaty, of, versailles, at, the, signing, ceremony, the, sense, of, betrayal, led, to, great, demonstrations, in, china, such, as, the, may, 4th, movement, there, was, immense, dissatisfaction, with, duan, qirui, s, government, which, had, secretly, negotiated, with, the, japanese, in, order, to, secure, loans, to, fund, their, military, campaigns, against, the, south, on, 12, june, 1919, the, chinese, cabinet, was, forced, to, resign, and, the, government, instructed, its, delegation, at, versailles, not, to, sign, the, treaty, as, a, result, relations, with, the, western, world, deteriorated, on, 29, april, the, german, delegation, under, the, leadership, of, the, foreign, minister, ulrich, graf, von, brockdorff, rantzau, arrived, in, versailles, on, 7, may, when, faced, with, the, conditions, dictated, by, the, victors, including, the, so, called, war, guilt, clause, von, brockdorff, rantzau, replied, to, clemenceau, wilson, and, lloyd, george, we, can, sense, the, full, force, of, hatred, that, confronts, us, here, you, demand, from, us, to, confess, we, were, the, only, guilty, party, of, war, such, a, confession, in, my, mouth, would, be, a, lie, because, germany, was, not, allowed, to, take, part, in, the, negotiations, the, german, government, issued, a, protest, against, what, it, considered, to, be, unfair, demands, and, a, violation, of, honour, soon, afterwards, withdrawing, from, the, proceedings, of, the, peace, conference, germans, of, all, political, shades, denounced, the, treaty, the, so, called, war, guilt, clause, that, they, saw, as, blaming, germany, for, starting, the, war, was, seen, as, an, insult, to, the, nation, s, honour, the, clauses, calling, on, the, germans, to, hand, over, alleged, war, criminals, also, caused, deep, offence, as, many, of, those, accused, were, seen, as, heroes, and, also, because, the, allies, were, seen, as, applying, one, sided, justice, they, referred, to, the, treaty, as, the, diktat, since, its, terms, were, presented, to, germany, on, a, take, it, or, leave, it, basis, germany, s, first, democratically, elected, head, of, government, philipp, scheidemann, resigned, rather, than, sign, the, treaty, in, an, emotional, and, polemical, address, to, the, weimar, national, assembly, on, 12, may, 1919, he, called, the, treaty, a, horrific, and, murderous, witch, s, hammer, and, exclaimed, which, hand, would, not, shrivel, that, shackled, itself, and, us, in, such, a, way, at, the, end, of, his, speech, scheidemann, stated, that, in, the, government, s, opinion, the, treaty, was, unacceptable, after, scheidemann, s, resignation, a, new, coalition, government, was, formed, under, gustav, bauer, president, friedrich, ebert, knew, that, germany, was, in, an, impossible, situation, although, he, shared, his, countrymen, s, disgust, with, the, treaty, he, was, sober, enough, to, consider, the, possibility, that, the, government, would, not, be, in, a, position, to, reject, it, he, believed, that, if, germany, refused, to, sign, the, treaty, the, allies, would, invade, germany, from, the, west, and, there, was, no, guarantee, that, the, army, would, be, able, to, make, a, stand, in, the, event, of, an, invasion, with, this, in, mind, he, asked, field, marshal, paul, von, hindenburg, if, the, army, was, capable, of, any, meaningful, resistance, in, the, event, the, allies, resumed, the, war, if, there, was, even, the, slightest, chance, that, the, army, could, hold, out, ebert, intended,

the, commission, recognized, that, the, central, powers, could, pay, little, and, that, the, burden, would, fall, upon, germany, as, a, result, the, sum, was, split, into, different, categories, of, which, germany, was, only, required, to, pay, 50, billion, gold, marks, us, 12, 5, billion, this, being, the, genuine, assessment, of, the, commission, on, what, germany, could, pay, and, allowed,

inexperienced, men, who, had, finished, basic, training, following, the, cessation, of, hostilities, by, 1920, the, baor, consisted, of, only, 40, 594, men, and, the, following, year, had, been, further, reduced, to, 12, 421, the, size, of, the, baor, fluctuated, over, the, following, years, but, never, rose, above, 9, 000, men, the, british, did, not, adhere, to, all, obligated, territorial, withdrawals, as, dictated, by, versailles, on, account, of, germany, not, meeting, her, own, treaty, obligations, a, complete, withdrawal, was, considered, but, rejected, in, order, to, maintain, a, presence, to, continue, acting, as, a, check, on, french, ambitions, and, prevent, the, establishment, of, an, autonomous, rhineland, republic, the, french, army, of, the, rhine, was, initially, 250,

colonial, troops, as, a, deliberate, act, of, humiliation, and, used, their, presence, to, create, a, propaganda, campaign, dubbed, the, black, shame, this, campaign, lasted, throughout, the, 1920s, and, 30s, although, peaked, in, 1920, and, 1921, for, example, a, 1921, german, government, memo, detailed, 300, acts, of, violence, from, colonial, troops, which, included, 65, murders, and, 170,

wilson, further, reduced, the, garrison, to, 6, 500, men, before, warren, g, harding, s, inauguration, in, 1921, on, 7, january, 1923, after, the, franco, belgian, occupation, of, the, ruhr, the, us,

early, february, in, june, 1921, germany, made, the, first, cash, payment, of, 1, billion, gold, marks, due, under, the, london, schedule, of, payments, however, this, was, the, only, full, payment, of, cash, made, under, the, unamended, schedule, and, from, then, until, the, dawes, plan, began, operation, in, late, 1924, only, small, cash, payments, were, made, whilst, in, kind, payments, of, goods, such, as, coal, and, timber, were, made, throughout, 1922, these, were, never, paid, in, full, and, in, december, 1922, germany, was, declared, in, default, of, timber, deliveries, by, a, 3, to, 1, vote, of, the, reparations, commission, the, british, representative, casting, the, sole, opposing, vote, on, 9, january, of, the, following, year, after, germany, had, defaulted, either, partially, or, wholly, on, coal, deliveries, for, the, thirty, fourth, time, in, thirty, six, months, the, reparations, commission, also, declared, germany, in, default, of, coal, reparations, and, authorised, the, occupation, of, the, ruhr, coalfields, in, order, to, secure, the, deliveries, again, with, the, british, representative, casting, the, sole, opposing, vote, and, all, other, votes, being, in, favour, in, a, move, that, was, condemned, by, the, british, french, belgian, and, italian, engineers, supported, by, french, and, belgian, forces, occupied, the, ruhr, area, on, 11, january, 1923, the, german, government, answered, with, passive, resistance, which, meant, that, coal, miners, and, railway, workers, refused, to, obey, any, instructions, by, the, occupation, forces, production, and, transportation, came, to, a, standstill, but, the, financial, consequences, including, the, payment, in, paper, currency, of, striking, workers, by, the, german, government, contributed, to, german, hyperinflation, in, the, period, from, late, 1921, to, 1924, consequently, passive, resistance, was, called, off, in, late, 1923, the, end, of, passive, resistance, in, the, ruhr, allowed, germany, to, undertake, a, currency, reform, and, to, negotiate, the, dawes, plan, which, led, to, the, withdrawal, of, french, and, belgian, troops, from, the, ruhr, area, in, 1925, the, agreement, of, the, dawes, plan, in, late, 1924, also, led, to, a, resumption, of, reparations, payments, in, hard, cash, and, gold, total, receipts, from, the, ruhr, occupation, summed, to, 900, million, gold, marks, from, the, agreement, of, the, dawes, plan, in, late, 1924, until, july, 1931, when, payment, was, suspended, under, a, proposal, by, herbert, hoover, as, a, result, of, the, great, depression, reparations, payments, were, made, regularly, and, on, time, both, in, cash, and, in, kind, though, always, slightly, less, than, was, required, under, the, plan, the, one, year, suspension, of, payments, under, the, hoover, moratorium, was, to, be, converted, into, a, permanent, moratorium, according, to, a, proposal, created, at, the, lausanne, conference, of, 1932, however, the, agreement, was, never, ratified, the, government, of, adolf, hitler, declared, all, further, payments, cancelled, in, 1933, and, no, further, reparations, payments, were, made, until, after, the, defeat, of, nazi, germany, in, the, second, world, war, germany, finally, paid, off, its, debts, under, the, versailles, treaty, which, had, been, reduced, by, 50, at, the, 1953, london, debt, conference, in, 2010, in, 1920, the, head, of, the, reichswehr, hans, von, seeckt, clandestinely, re, established, the, general, staff, by, expanding, the, truppenamt, troop, office, purportedly, a,

germany, and, in, doing, so, violated, the, demilitarized, zone, in, response, french, troops, advanced, farther, into, germany, until, the, german, troops, withdrew, german, officials, conspired, systematically, to, evade, the, clauses, of, the, treaty, by, failing, to, meet, disarmament, deadlines, refusing, allied, officials, access, to, military, facilities, and, maintaining, and, hiding, weapon, production, as, the, treaty, did, not, ban, german, companies, from, producing, war, material, outside, of, germany, companies, moved, to, the, netherlands, switzerland, and, sweden, bofors, was, bought, by, krupp, and, in, 1921, german, troops, were, sent, to, sweden, to, test, weapons, the, establishment, of, diplomatic, ties, with, the, soviet, union, via, the, genoa, conference, and, treaty, of, rapallo, was, also, used, to, circumvent, the, treaty, of, versailles, publicly, these, diplomatic, exchanges, were, largely, in, regards, to, trade, and, future, economic, cooperation, but, secret, military, clauses, were, included, that, allowed, for, germany, to, develop, weapons, inside, the, soviet, union, furthermore, it, allowed, for, germany, to, establish, three, training, areas, for, aviation, chemical, and, tank, warfare, in, 1923, the, british, newspaper, the, times, made, several, claims, about, the, state, of, the, german, armed, forces, that, it, had, equipment, for, 800, 000, men, was, transferring, army, staff, to, civilian, positions, in, order, to, obscure, their, real, duties, and, warned, of, the, militarization, of, the, german, police, force, by, the, exploitation, the, kr, mper, system, the, weimar, government, also, funded, domestic, rearmament, programs, which, were, covertly, funded, with, the, money, camouflaged, in, x, budgets, worth, up, to, an, additional, 10, of, the, disclosed, military, budget, by, 1925, german, companies, had, begun, to, design, tanks, and, modern, artillery, during, the, year, over, half, of, chinese, arms, imports,

through, the, army, to, make, a, pool, of, trained, reserves, and, paramilitary, organizations, were, encouraged, with, the, illegally, militarized, police, non, commissioned, officers, ncos, were, not, limited, by, the, treaty, thus, this, loophole, was, exploited, and, as, such, the, number, of, ncos, were, vastly, in, excess, to, the, number, needed, by, the, reichswehr, in, december, 1931, the, reichswehr, finalized, a, second, rearmament, plan, that, called, for, 480, million, reichsmarks, to, be, spent, over, the, following, five, years, this, program, sought, to, provide, germany, the, capability, of, creating, and, supplying, a, defensive, force, of, 21, divisions, supported, by, aircraft, artillery, and, tanks, this, coincided, with, a, 1, billion, reichsmark, programme, that, planned, for, additional, industrial, infrastructure, that, would, be, able, to, permanently, maintain, this, force, as, these, programs, did, not, require, an, expansion, of, the, military,

equality, of, status, london, attempted, to, get, germany, to, return, with, the, promise, of, all, nations, maintaining, an, equality, in, armaments, and, security, the, british, later, proposed, and, agreed, to, an, increase, in, the, reichswehr, to, 200, 000, men, and, for, germany, to, have, an, air, force, half, the, size, of, the, french, it, was, also, negotiated, for, the, french, army, to, be, reduced, in, october, 1933, following, the, rise, of, adolf, hitler, and, the, founding, of, the, nazi, regime, germany, withdrew, from, the, league, of, nations, and, the, world, disarmament,

alleged, criminals, was, prepared, by, the, allies, however, this, was, later, reduced, following, the, ratification, of, the, treaty, in, january, 1920, the, allies, submitted, a, request, that, 890, or, 895, alleged, war, criminals, be, extradited, for, trial, france, and, belgium, each, requested, the, extradition, of, 334, individuals, including, von, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, for, the, damages, they, had, inflicted, on, belgium, and, the, mass, deportations, they, had, overseen, from, both, france, and, belgium, britain, submitted, a, list, of, 94, names, including, von, tirpitz, for, the, sinkings, of, civilian, shipping, by, german, u, boats, italy, s, request, included, 29, names, divided, between, those, accused, of, mistreating, prisoners, of, war, and, those, responsible, for, u, boat, sinkings, romania, requested, the, extradition, of, 41, individuals, including, von, mackensen, poland, requested, 51, people, be, extradited, and, yugoslavia, successor, to, wartime, serbia, four, germany, refused, extradition, however, claiming, that, carrying, out, such, a, request, to, extradite, people, widely, regarded, as, heroes, in, germany, would, likely, result, in, the, fall, of, the, government, but, made, a, counter, offer, of, holding, trials, at, leipzig, an, offer, that, was, ultimately, accepted, by, the, allies, after, subsequent, negotiation, the, list, of, alleged, war, criminals, submitted, by, the, allies, for, trial, at, leipzig, was, reduced, to, 45, however, this, ultimately, also, ended, up, being, too, many, for, the, german, authorities, and, in, the, end, only, 12, officers, were, put, on, trial, six, from, the, british, list, five, from, the, french, one, and, one, from, the, belgian, list, the, british, list, included, only, low, level, officers, and, enlisted, men, including, a, prison, guard, accused, of, beating, prisoners, of, war, and, two, u, boat, commanders, who, sank, hospital, ships, the, dover, castle, and, the, llandovery, castle, in, contrast, the, french, list, were, all, high, ranking, officials, including, lieutenant, general, karl, stenger, who, was, accused, of, massacring, french, prisoners, of, war, the, belgian, case, involved, a, man, accused, of, mistreating, and, imprisoning, belgian, children, however, when, the, germans, announced, that, the, trial, would, be, under, german, law, with, the, german, prosecutor, being, able, to, exercise, prosecutorial, discretion, the, french, and, belgians, withdrew, from, the, process, in, protest, only, half, of, the, cases, led, to, conviction, with, superior, orders, being, allowed, as, a, defence, in, the, dover, castle, case, and, in, mitigation, in, the, llandovery, castle, case, where, the, officer, responsible, had, massacred, seamen, in, lifeboats, all, but, one, of, the, people, put, forward, by, the, french, were, acquitted, including, karl, stenger, who, was, showered, with, flowers, by, german, spectators, the, belgian, case, was, also, acquitted, the, commission, of, allied, jurists, responded, to, these, proceedings, on, 22, january, 1922, by, declaring, that, the, leipzig, court, had, failed, to, carry, out, its, mandate, by, failing, to, convict, accused, who, should, have, been, convicted, and, by, showing, excessive, leniency, even, where, people, had, been, convicted, the, allied, jurists, recommended, that, extradition, of, war, criminals, be, requested, under, article, 228, however, no, further, extradition, request, was, made, though, trials, were, held, in, france, and, belgium, of, german, war, criminals, in, absentia, historians, are, split, on, the, impact, of, the, treaty, some, saw, it, as, a, good, solution, in, a, difficult, time, others, saw, it, as, a, disastrous, measure, that, would, anger, the, germans, to, seek, revenge, the, actual, impact, of, the, treaty, is, also, disputed, in, his, book, the, economic, consequences, of, the, peace, john, maynard, keynes, referred, to, the, treaty, of, versailles, as, a, carthaginian, peace, a, misguided, attempt, to, destroy, germany, on, behalf, of, french, revanchism, rather, than, to, follow, the, fairer, principles, for, a, lasting, peace, set, out, in, wilson, s, fourteen, points, which, germany, had, accepted, at, the, armistice, he, stated, i, believe, that, the, campaign, for, securing, out, of, germany, the, general, costs, of, the, war, was, one, of, the, most, serious, acts, of, political, unwisdom, for, which, our, statesmen, have, ever, been, responsible, keynes, had, been, the, principal, representative, of, the, british, treasury, at, the, paris, peace, conference, and, used, in, his, passionate, book, arguments, that, he, and, others, including, some, us, officials, had, used, at, paris, he, believed, the, sums, being, asked, of, germany, in, reparations, were, many, times, more, than, it, was, possible, for, germany, to, pay, and, that, these, would, produce, drastic, instability, french, economist, tienne, mantoux, disputed, that, analysis, during, the, 1940s, mantoux, wrote, a, posthumously, published, book, titled, the, carthaginian, peace, or, the, economic, consequences, of, mr, keynes, in, an, attempt, to, rebut, keynes, claims, more, recently, economists, have, argued, that, the, restriction, of, germany, to, a, small, army, saved, it, so, much, money, it, could, afford, the, reparations, payments, it, has, been, argued, for, instance, by, historian, gerhard, weinberg, in, his, book, a, world, at, arms, that, the, treaty, was, in, fact, quite, advantageous, to, germany, the, bismarckian, reich, was, maintained, as, a, political, unit, instead, of, being, broken, up, and, germany, largely, escaped, post, war, military, occupation, in, contrast, to, the, situation, following, world, war, ii, in, a, 1995, essay, weinberg, noted, that, with, the, disappearance, of, austria, hungary, and, with, russia, withdrawn, from, europe, that, germany, was, now, the, dominant, power, in, eastern, europe, the, british, military, historian, correlli, barnett, argued, that, the, treaty, of, versailles, was, extremely, lenient, in, comparison, with, the, peace, terms, that, germany, herself, when, she, was, expecting, to, win, the, war, had, had, in, mind, to, impose, on, the, allies, furthermore, he, said, it, was, hardly, a, slap, on, the, wrist, when, contrasted, with, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, that, germany, had, imposed, on, a, defeated, russian, sfsr, in, march, 1918, which, had, taken, away, a, third, of, russia, s, population, albeit, mostly, of, non, russian, ethnicity, one, half, of, russia, s, industrial, undertakings, and, nine, tenths, of, russia, s, coal, mines, coupled, with, an, indemnity, of, six, billion, marks, eventually, even, under, the, cruel, terms, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, germany, s, economy, had, been, restored, to, its, pre, war, status, barnett, also, argues, that, in, strategic, terms, germany, was, in, fact, in, a, superior, position, following, the, treaty, than, she, had, been, in, 1914, germany, s, eastern, frontiers, faced, russia, and, austria, who, had, both, in, the, past, balanced, german, power, barnett, asserts, that, its, post, war, eastern, borders, were, safer, because, the, former, austrian, empire, fractured, after, the, war, into, smaller, weaker, states, russia, was, wracked, by, revolution, and, civil, war, and, the, newly, restored, poland, was, no, match, for, even, a, defeated, germany, in, the, west, germany, was, balanced, only, by, france, and, belgium, both, of, which, were, smaller, in, population, and, less, economically, vibrant, than, germany, barnett, concludes, by, saying, that, instead, of, weakening, germany, the, treaty, much, enhanced, german, power, britain, and, france, should, have, according, to, barnett, divided, and, permanently, weakened, germany, by, undoing, bismarck, s, work, and, partitioning, germany, into, smaller, weaker, states, so, it, could, never, have, disrupted, the, peace, of, europe, again, by, failing, to, do, this, and, therefore, not, solving, the, problem, of, german, power, and, restoring, the, equilibrium, of, europe, britain, had, failed, in, her, main, purpose, in, taking, part, in, the, great, war, the, british, historian, of, modern, germany, richard, j, evans, wrote, that, during, the, war, the, german, right, was, committed, to, an, annexationist, program, which, aimed, at, germany, annexing, most, of, europe, and, africa, consequently, any, peace, treaty, that, did, not, leave, germany, as, the, conqueror, would, be, unacceptable, to, them, short, of, allowing, germany, to, keep, all, the, conquests, of, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, evans, argued, that, there, was, nothing, that, could, have, been, done, to, persuade, the, german, right, to, accept, versailles, evans, further, noted, that, the, parties, of, the, weimar, coalition, namely, the, social, democratic, party, of, germany, spd, the, social, liberal, german, democratic, party, ddp, and, the, christian, democratic, centre, party, were, all, equally, opposed, to, versailles, and, it, is, false, to, say, as, some, historians, have, that, opposition, to, versailles, also, equalled, opposition, to, the, weimar, republic, finally, evans, argued, that, it, is, untrue, that, versailles, caused, the, premature, end, of, the, republic, instead, contending, that, it, was, the, great, depression, of, the, early, 1930s, that, put, an, end, to, german, democracy, he, also, argued, that, versailles, was, not, the, main, cause, of, national, socialism, and, the, german, economy, was, only, marginally, influenced, by, the, impact, of, reparations, ewa, thompson, points, out, that, the, treaty, allowed, numerous, nations, in, central, and, eastern, europe, to, liberate, themselves, from, oppressive, german, rule, a, fact, that, is, often, neglected, by, western, historiography, more, interested, in, understanding, the, german, point, of, view, in, nations, that, found, themselves, free, as, the, result, of, the, treaty, such, as, poles, or, czechs, it, is, seen, as, a, symbol, of, recognition, of, wrongs, committed, against, small, nations, by, their, much, larger, aggressive, neighbours, resentment, caused, by, the, treaty, sowed, fertile, psychological, ground, for, the, eventual, rise, of, the, nazi, party, but, the, german, born, australian, historian, j, rgen, tampke, argued, that, it, was, a, perfidious, distortion, of, history, to, argue, that, the, terms, prevented, the, growth, of, democracy, in, germany, and, aided, the, growth, of, the, nazi, party, saying, that, its, terms, were, not, as, punitive, as, often, held, and, that, german, hyper, inflation, in, the, 1920s, was, partly, a, deliberate, policy, to, minimise, the, cost, of, reparations, as, an, example, of, the, arguments, against, the, versaillerdiktat, he, quotes, elizabeth, wiskemann, who, heard, two, officer, s, widows, in, wiesbaden, complaining, that, with, their, stocks, of, linen, depleted, they, had, to, have, their, linen, washed, once, a, fortnight, every, two, weeks, instead, of, once, a, month, the, german, historian, detlev, peukert, wrote, that, versailles, was, far, from, the, impossible, peace, that, most, germans, claimed, it, was, during, the, interwar, period, and, though, not, without, flaws, was, actually, quite, reasonable, to, germany, rather, peukert, argued, that, it, was, widely, believed, in, germany, that, versailles, was, a, totally, unreasonable, treaty, and, it, was, this, perception, rather, than, the, reality, of, the, versailles, treaty, that, mattered, peukert, noted, that, because, of, the, millenarian, hopes, created, in, germany, during, world, war, i, when, for, a, time, it, appeared, that, germany, was, on, the, verge, of, conquering, all, of, europe, any, peace, treaty, the, allies, of, world, war, i, imposed, on, the, defeated, german, reich, were, bound, to, create, a, nationalist, backlash, and, there, was, nothing, the, allies, could, have, done, to, avoid, that, backlash, having, noted, that, much, peukert, commented, that, the, policy, of, rapprochement, with, the, western, powers, that, gustav, stresemann, carried, out, between, 1923, and, 1929, were, constructive, policies, that, might, have, allowed, germany, to, play, a, more, positive, role, in, europe, and, that, it, was, not, true, that, german, democracy, was, doomed, to, die, in, 1919, because, of, versailles, finally, peukert, argued, that, it, was, the, great, depression, and, the, turn, to, a, nationalist, policy, of, autarky, within, germany, at, the, same, time, that, finished, off, the, weimar, republic, not, the, treaty, of, versailles, french, historian, raymond, cartier, states, that, millions, of, ethnic, germans, in, the, sudetenland, and, in, posen, west, prussia, were, placed, under, foreign, rule, in, a, hostile, environment, where, harassment, and, violation, of, rights, by, authorities, are, documented, cartier, asserts, that, out, of, 1, 058, 000, germans, in, posen, west, prussia, in, 1921, 758, 867, fled, their, homelands, within, five, years, due, to, polish, harassment, these, sharpening, ethnic, conflicts, would, lead, to, public, demands, to, reattach, the, annexed, territory, in, 1938, and, become, a, pretext, for, hitler, s, annexations, of, czechoslovakia, and, parts, of, poland, according, to, david, stevenson, since, the, opening, of, french, archives, most, commentators, have, remarked, on, french, restraint, and, reasonableness, at, the, conference, though, stevenson, notes, that, he, jury, is, still, out, and, that, there, have, been, signs, that, the, pendulum, of, judgement, is, swinging, back, the, other, way, the, treaty, of, versailles, resulted, in, the, creation, of, several, thousand, miles, of, new, boundaries, with, maps, playing, a, central, role, in, the, negotiations, at, paris, the, plebiscites, initiated, due, to, the, treaty, have, drawn, much, comment, historian, robert, peckham, wrote, that, the, issue, of, schleswig, was, premised, on, a, gross, simplification, of, the, region, s, history, versailles, ignored, any, possibility, of, there, being, a, third, way, the, kind, of, compact, represented, by, the, swiss, federation, a, bilingual, or, even, trilingual, schleswig, holsteinian, state, or, other, options, such, as, a, schleswigian, state, in, a, loose, confederation, with, denmark, or, germany, or, an, autonomous, region, under, the, protection, of, the, league, of, nations, in, regard, to, the, east, prussia, plebiscite, historian, richard, blanke, wrote, that, no, other, contested, ethnic, group, has, ever, under, un, coerced, conditions, issued, so, one, sided, a, statement, of, its, national, preference, richard, debo, wrote, both, berlin, and, warsaw, believed, the, soviet, invasion, of, poland, had, influenced, the, east, prussian, plebiscites, poland, appeared, so, close, to, collapse, that, even, polish, voters, had, cast, their, ballots, for, germany, in, regard, to, the, silesian, plebiscite, blanke, observed, given, that, the, electorate, was, at, least, 60, polish, speaking, this, means, that, about, one, pole, in, three, voted, for, germany, and, most, polish, observers, and, historians, have, concluded, that, the, outcome, of, the, plebiscite, was, due, to, unfair, german, advantages, of, incumbency, and, socio, economic, position, blanke, alleged, coercion, of, various, kinds, even, in, the, face, of, an, allied, occupation, regime, occurred, and, that, germany, granted, votes, to, those, who, had, been, born, in, upper, silesia, but, no, longer, resided, there, blanke, concluded, that, despite, these, protests, there, is, plenty, of, other, evidence, including, reichstag, election, results, both, before, and, after, 1921, and, the, large, scale, emigration, of, polish, speaking, upper, silesians, to, germany, after, 1945, that, their, identification, with, germany, in, 1921, was, neither, exceptional, nor, temporary, and, here, was, a, large, population, of, germans, and, poles, not, coincidentally, of, the, same, catholic, religion, that, not, only, shared, the, same, living, space, but, also, came, in, many, cases, to, see, themselves, as, members, of, the, same, national, community, prince, eustachy, sapieha, the, polish, minister, of, foreign, affairs, alleged, that, soviet, russia, appeared, to, be, intentionally, delaying, negotiations, to, end, the, polish, soviet, war, with, the, object, of, influencing, the, upper, silesian, plebiscite, once, the, region, was, partitioned, both, germany, and, poland, attempted, to, cleanse, their, shares, of, upper, silesia, via, oppression, resulting, in, germans, migrating, to, germany, and, poles, migrating, to, poland, despite, the, oppression, and, migration, opole, silesia, remained, ethnically, mixed, frank, russell, wrote, that, in, regard, to, the, saar, plebiscite, the, inhabitants, were, not, terrorized, at, the, polls, and, the, totalitarian, german, regime, was, not, distasteful, to, most, of, the, saar, inhabitants, and, that, they, preferred, it, even, to, an, efficient, economical, and, benevolent, international, rule, when, the, outcome, of, the, vote, became, known, 4, 100, including, 800, refugees, who, had, previously, fled, germany, residents, fled, over, the, border, into, france, during, the, formulation, of, the, treaty, the, british, wanted, germany, to, abolish, conscription, but, be, allowed, to, maintain, a, volunteer, army, the, french, wanted, germany, to, maintain, a, conscript, army, of, up, to, 200, 000, men, in, order, to, justify, their, own, maintenance, of, a, similar, force, thus, the, treaty, s, allowance, of, 100, 000, volunteers, was, a, compromise, between, the, british, and, french, positions, germany, on, the, other, hand, saw, the, terms, as, leaving, them, defenseless, against, any, potential, enemy, bernadotte, everly, schmitt, wrote, that, there, is, no, reason, to, believe, that, the, allied, governments, were, insincere, when, they, stated, at, the, beginning, of, part, v, of, the, treaty, that, in, order, to, facilitate, a, general, reduction, of, the, armament, of, all, nations, germany, was, to, be, required, to, disarm, first, a, lack, of, american, ratification, of, the, treaty, or, joining, the, league, of, nations, left, france, unwilling, to, disarm, which, resulted, in, a, german, desire, to, rearm, schmitt, argued, had, the, four, allies, remained, united, they, could, have, forced, germany, really, to, disarm, and, the, german, will, and, capacity, to, resist, other, provisions, of, the, treaty, would, have, correspondingly, diminished, max, hantke, and, mark, spoerer, wrote, military, and, economic, historians, found, that, the, german, military, only, insignificantly, exceeded, the, limits, of, the, treaty, before, 1933, adam, tooze, concurred, and, wrote, to, put, this, in, perspective, annual, military, spending, by, the, weimar, republic, was, counted, not, in, the, billions, but, in, the, hundreds, of, millions, of, reichsmarks, for, example, the, weimar, republic, s, 1931, program, of, 480, million, reichsmarks, over, five, years, compared, to, the, nazi, government, s, 1933, plan, to, spend, 4, 4, billion, reichsmarks, per, year, p, m, h, bell, argued, that, the, british, government, was, aware, of, later, weimar, rearming, and, lent, public, respectability, to, the, german, efforts, by, not, opposing, them, an, opinion, shared, by, churchill, norman, davies, wrote, that, a, curious, oversight, of, the, military, restrictions, were, that, they, did, not, include, rockets, in, its, list, of, prohibited, weapons, which, provided, wernher, von, braun, an, area, to, research, within, eventually, resulting, in, his, break, came, in, 1943, leading, to, the, development, of, the, v, 2, rocket, the, treaty, created, much, resentment, in, germany, which, was, exploited, by, adolf, hitler, in, his, rise, to, power, at, the, helm, of, nazi, germany, central, to, this, was, belief, in, the, stab, in, the, back, myth, which, held, that, the, german, army, had, not, lost, the, war, and, had, been, betrayed, by, the, weimar, republic, who, negotiated, an, unnecessary, surrender, the, great, depression, exacerbated, the, issue, and, led, to, a, collapse, of, the, german, economy, though, the, treaty, may, not, have, caused, the, crash, it, was, a, convenient, scapegoat, germans, viewed, the, treaty, as, a, humiliation, and, eagerly, listened, to, hitler, s, oratory, which, blamed, the, treaty, for, germany, s, ills, hitler, promised, to, reverse, the, depredations, of, the, allied, powers, and, recover, germany, s, lost, territory, and, pride, which, has, led, to, the, treaty, being, cited, as, a, cause, of, world, war, ii, hermann, g, ring, first, met, adolf, hitler, at, a, speech, which, hitler, gave, at, a, rally, against, french, demands, for, the, extradition, of, alleged, german, war,
